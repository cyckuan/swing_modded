<HEADLINE> DPRK Calls for Security Assurance From U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) urged the United States to give legal
assurance not to use nuclear weapons against it, its
representative to the United Nations said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Presenting the DPRK's position on the issue, Kim Chang Guk told
the U.N. Disarmament Commission that if the Korean Peninsula was
to be denuclearized, the United States, a party directly
responsible for peace and stability on the peninsula, should give
legal assurance that it would not use or threaten to use nuclear
weapons against his country.
</P>
<P>
He called on the U.S. to rescind its commitment to provide a
nuclear umbrella to South Korea, according to a press release by
the U.N. Public Information Department Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The commission was holding its plenary meeting here from April
6-28.
</P>
<P>
The North-South joint declaration on denuclearization of the
peninsula, signed in December 1991, had not been implemented
because of U.S. unwillingness to take any legal steps to that end,
Kim said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. reluctance to renounce its commitment of providing a
nuclear umbrella to South Korea and to give assurance of non-use
to the DPRK was motivated by a policy of maintaining the
confrontational structure of the Cold-War era on the peninsula, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Jobless Rate Down to 8.5 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Canada's unemployment rate edged
down 0.1 percentage points to 8.5 percent in March, the lowest
since August 1990, Statistics Canada reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In March, employment across the country increased by 18,000,
while unemployment fell by 25,000, the statistics agency said.
</P>
<P>
Canada's private sector continues to play the role of job
creators. In March, the number of private sector employees climbed
by 39,000, continuing the strong upward trend since February 1997.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the number of employees in the public sector
fell by 21,000, leaving employment lower by 34,000 compared with
February 1997.
</P>
<P>
For the second consecutive month, employment in manufacturing
rose by 30,000. This industry has shown strong growth of 184,000
since February 1997.
</P>
<P>
Employment in health and social services rose by 22,000 in
March, leaving it slightly higher than in February 1997.
Agricultural employment also increased in March.
</P>
<P>
These gains were partially offset by losses in utilities,
business and personal services, and finance, insurance and real
estate, the agency said.

<HEADLINE> Diesel Engines Could Cause Cancer: U.S. Finding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Diesel engines widely used in
buses and large trucks can probably cause cancer in humans,
according to a report of the USA Today Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. authorities once hope the diesel engines can support
the country's battle against global warming. But a draft report by
the Environmental Protection Agency gives another story.
</P>
<P>
The EPA report notes that animals get cancer when exposed to
high levels of diesel exhaust, which contains hundreds of
chemicals. And it says that studies of humans exposed to diesel
fumes on the job show that they had a higher risk of lung cancer
than those not exposed.
</P>
<P>
But the report says that the results are based on pre-1998
diesel engines, which cause more pollution.
</P>
<P>
Diesel engines get 15-30 percent better mileage than gasoline
engines. The less fuel an engine burns, the lower its emissions of
carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is a key culprit in global warming,
according to the report. So the government is looking to the
diesel engine as a tool to help slow global warming.

<HEADLINE> Russia, Kazakhstan to Divide Oil Reserves in Caspian Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Kazakhstan and Russia have agreed
on how to resolve the issue on the status of the oil-rich Caspian
Sea, the world's largest inland sea.
</P>
<P>
Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev, who is on a visit to
Russia, and Russian President Boris Yeltsin reached agreement on
the issue during their talks here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, Nazarbayev told reporters that the two
countries would sign an agreement on April 28 over the division of
the Caspian Sea.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said progress had been made over the definition of the
status of the Caspian Sea thanks to joint efforts by the two
sides, said The Russian Presidential Press Secretary Sergei
Yastrzhembsky.
</P>
<P>
The five nations bordering the Caspian Sea -- Azerbaijan, Iran,
Kazakhstan, Russia and Turkmenistan -- have been edging closer to
an overall agreement on how to divide the sea to tap vast energy
reserves.
</P>
<P>
Russia indicated in January it was shifting toward the position
of Kazakhstan, which proposed dividing the sea's continental shelf
along a center line.
</P>
<P>
The benefits to the five littoral states could be huge, with
the Caspian Sea sitting on one of the largest untapped oil
reserves in the world, which are estimated at some 13-15 billion
tons.

<HEADLINE> 107 Pilgrims killed in Stampede in Saudi Arabia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 9 (Xinhua) -- At least 107 Muslim pilgrims
were killed Thursday in a stampede during the last day of the hajj
in Saudi Arabia, the Kuwait News Agency (KUNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The stampede, which took place on the plains of Mina outside
Mecca, occurred at 12:40 p.m. (0940 GMT) as the pilgrims performed
a ritual on the last day of the hajj, which drew more than 2
million Muslims, it said.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of pilgrims struggled with the hot weather.
Helicopters had hovered overhead to spot pilgrims who fell off.
</P>
<P>
Police using loud speakers had pleaded for pilgrims to move
along quickly.
</P>
<P>
The KUNA quoted a statement by the Hajj security command as
saying that some elderly and sick pilgrims fell off the bridge,
and the security authorities made an extraordinary effort to
rescue them, but in the rush which ensued, about 107 pilgrims died.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the identities of the victims were not
yet known.
</P>
<P>
The stampede, the first since the hajj season began earlier
this month, was the latest tragedy to befall the hajj which in the
past has been marred by other stampedes and fires.
</P>
<P>
A total of 343 people were killed and many others injured in a
blaze last year in the camped ares in Mina, about eight kilometers
from Mount Arafat.
</P>
<P>
The authorities in the kingdom improved security measures
during the hajj season this year following last year's fire and
previous tragedies, including stampedes.

<HEADLINE> India Claims to be Able to Counter Pakistan Missile Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Indian Defense Minister George
Fernandes said Thursday that India has adequate surface-to-surface
"Prithvi" missiles to counter threats from Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Fernandes told a news briefing that India "has an adequate
number of 'Prithvi' missiles" in its arsenal and "need not be a
bit worried about what Pakistan is doing.
</P>
<P>
"We are capable of taking care of our security situation
vis-a-vis Pakistan," he said.
</P>
<P>
India reacted strongly over the April 6 test-firing of
Pakistan's surface-to-surface Ghauri missile, which has a
1,500-kilometer range.
</P>
<P>
Asked if India would continue to test-fire its newly-developed
2,500 kilometer range ballistic missile "Agni," Fernandes said the
missile had already undergone all the necessary tests and needs no
further tests.
</P>
<P>
The Indian government has stated that India would not succumb
to any pressure from the United States, which has asked India to
stop developing the "Agni" missile.

<HEADLINE> Russia Stages National Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Russia's independent trade unions
organized a nationwide protest on Thursday, but in a scale smaller
than expected, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
A total of 70,000 people were expected to join the action in
the Russian far eastern maritime territory, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators demand, among other things, that wages in
arrears be paid off by the government before July this year, and
their rights as working people be protected.
</P>
<P>
The Itar-Tass quoted a territorial administration spokesman as
saying that 15 million rubles (2530 U.S. dollars) appropriated
from the federal government in wages had been paid to state
employees, and another 7 million rubles was to come to the
territory this week.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics showed that wages in arrears, as of this
February, hit a record high of 57 billion, 768 million
redenominated rubles (9.64 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Wage delays have become the country's most serious social
problem and a main source of tension in the country, Chairman of
the Russian Federation of Independent Trade Unions Mikhail Shmakov
said recently.
</P>
<P>
The chairman said Tuesday that his federation supported Sergei
Kiriyenko's candidacy for premiership.
</P>
<P>
Trade unions are ready to support any government which is able
to meet their demands, Shmakov said recently. He said they even
had their own candidates for the post of labor minister.

<HEADLINE> UK Companies Spend a Lot on Year 2000 Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The cost of achieving Year 2000
compliance and preparing for European Monetary Union is rising
steeply, according to a Survey published Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The survey by Computer Weekly, the Information Intelligence
(IT) magazine, revealed that UK-based companies and the public
sector plan to spend 3.9 billion pounds (6.24 billion U.S.
dollars) this year on Year 2000 projects, up from 2.72 billion
pounds (4.35 billion dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
Spending on EMU conversion projects will double from 7.12
billion pounds (11.39 billion dollars) with more than half the
cost falling on the financial services sector.
</P>
<P>
On average companies and the public sector will spend 1,945
pounds (3,112 dollars) for each employee on IT this year,
including 173 pounds (277 dollars) on the Year 2000 problem,
against 121 pounds (194 dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
Overall IT spending is expected to increase by 13.7 percent to
44.3 billion pounds (70.9 billion dollars) this year, from 39.1
billion pounds (62.6 billion dollars) last year and 35.3 billion
pounds (56.5 billion dollars) in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The survey also revealed differences between individual
sectors. For example, banking and finance will spend 935 million
pounds (1,496 million dollars) on Year 2000 work this year,
compared with less than 90 million pounds (144 million dollars) by
the health service.

<HEADLINE> British Investors Top US Bond-Holder List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Britain has overtaken Japan as the
largest single overseas holder of U.S. government bonds, according
to data from the U.S. Treasury.
</P>
<P>
Investors based in the UK owned 300.1 billion U.S. dollars of
U.S. Treasuries at the end of January, compared with the 293.3
billion U.S. dollars held by Japanese.
</P>
<P>
The shift reflects both a substantial move into U.S. bonds by
British-based investors, who bought nearly 100 billion U.S.
dollars worth in 1997, and a sell-off by Japanese investors in the
fourth quarter of last year.
</P>
<P>
Experts in the City said the British move into U.S. Treasury
bonds had been undertaken mainly by the private sector. And it
appears the purchases may have been made by overseas investors
based in Britain.
</P>
<P>
The explanation for the increase may be that many global bond
funds are aged in London, rather than New York, they added.
</P>
<P>
These experts said the funds had been popular in recent years
as low inflation has made bonds attractive again after the
inflationary ravages of the 1970s and 1980s.

<HEADLINE> UK Interest Rates Do Not Need to Rise, Says OECD </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Prospects for growth in Britain
this year have deteriorated significantly, according to a forecast
from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
(OECD).
</P>
<P>
The squeeze on export growth and manufacturing due to the
strong pound means there is "little need for further base-rate
increases," its latest "Economic Outlook" said.
</P>
<P>
It noted that falling unemployment has driven earnings growth
to a rate "barely consistent" with the inflation target.
</P>
<P>
However, it said monetary policy is already very tight and
concluded that inflation will stay close to target. It also said
that the British government's fiscal policy is moderately
contractionary.
</P>
<P>
The organization has therefore adjusted its forecast for the
UK's growth this year to 1.7 percent, from the 2.2 percent it
predicted in December.
</P>
<P>
It foresaw unemployment starting to rise before the end of the
year and through 1999, and said interest rates could begin to fall
before the end of this year and reach 5.5 percent by the end of
next year.
</P>
<P>
The forecast knocked nearly three pfennigs off the pound
Wednesday. It ended below 3.04 German marks, the sterling index
falling 0.6 to 107.4.

</P>
<P>
About 60 trade ministers and high-ranking officials from the

for the second World Trade Organization (WTO) ministerial
conference to be held in Geneva next month.
</P>
<P>
They reviewed the implementation of Singapore ministerial
declaration and future world at the WTO, discussed the future of

United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and
United Nations Development Program (UNDP) regional program for
capacity building in trade and development for Africa.
</P>
<P>
At the closing ceremony, Rajkeswur Purryag, Deputy Premier and

<HEADLINE> London Oil Price Up on Venezuela's Contract Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Oil prices on the London market
edged higher early Thursday following major producer Venezuela's
decision Wednesday to cut some oil contracts as part of production
reduction required under a global price rescue pact.
</P>
<P>
North Sea benchmark Brent crude was trading at 14.15 U.S.
dollars a barrel, 17 cents higher by 1537 GMT.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Venezuela announced late Wednesday that it
would not honor some of its crude oil contracts, and so far it has
cut its oil production by 200,000 barrels per day (bpd) as part of
an overall deal between OPEC and non-OPEC producers to cut about
1.5 million bpd from global supply.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the market was also lifted by a string of other
factors, including Russia's announcement of a small output cut and
U.S. efforts to delay the sale of oil in its Strategic Petroleum
Reserve.
</P>
<P>
Because of doubts about the output cuts deal between OPEC and
non-OPEC producers, world oil prices have been still under
pressure since the deal was reached and the Brent crude was seen
average a disastrous 4.50 dollars a barrel less so far this year
than in 1997.

current controversy within the party's leadership on how to deal
with Ndebele for seeking to protect suspended Masvingo provincial
Chairman Dzikamai Mavhaire by invoking parliamentary privileges,
Mugabe said it was unfortunate that such disagreements had been
aired in public.
</P>
<P>
"I think the matter should not have been discussed in public.
It must be discussed by the politburo and the politburo holds
frequent meetings when such issues can be discussed," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ndebele was supposed to be summoned for issuing a certificate
of immunity to Masvingo central MP Mavhaire for saying in
parliament that Mugabe "must go."
</P>
<P>
Mavhaire has been suspended from holding party position for
the next two years.
</P>
<P>
While party Chairman Joseph Msika maintained that Ndebele had
no case to answer, Secretary for Administration Didymus Mutasa
said Ndebele should be tried.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said it was not healthy for the party, currently facing
difficult times of factionalism and regional divisions, to have
such disagreements aired in public.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 9 (xinhua) -- The U.N. mission
investigating the alleged massacre of Rwanda's Hutu refugees in
the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has been instructed to
suspend its activities in the country, U.N. spokesman Juan Carlos
Brandt announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The move came amid a series of incidents which happened in the
past few days, including the detention in Kinshasa by the DRC
authorities of Christopher Harland, a Canadian human rights
investigator in the mission, and the search and seizure of U.N.
official documents.
</P>
<P>
The team has suffered numerous setbacks since it began last
August to investigate evidence of alleged massacres of Rwandan
Hutu refugees by the forces of President Laurent Kabila and his
Rwandan Tushi allies when they toppled late President Mobutu Sese
Seko last May.
</P>

The United Nations and the Kinshasa authorities bickered for

<HEADLINE> Expanded Lebanese-Syrian Summit to Be Held in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 9 (Xinhua) -- An expanded Lebanese-Syrian summit
is expected to be held Saturday in the Syrian coastal city of
Latakia to review regional developments and attempt to reconcile
Lebanese feuding leaders.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made in the last summit only two days ago
between President Elias Hrawi of Lebanon and President Hafez
al-Assad of Syria in Damascus, Lebanon's Central News Agency
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The forthcoming meeting will be attended by Hrawi and al-Assad
along with their prime ministers, house speakers and other
ministers.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the latest Israeli withdrawal offer, the summit
will deal with the disputes among Lebanon's ruling troika members
over the civil marriage law, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Israel has offered to withdraw its troops from south Lebanon,
but linked the pullout to negotiated security arrangements from
the Lebanese government.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and its ally Syria whose Golan Heights has been under
occupation of Israel since the 1967 Mideast war, flatly rejected
the offer, urging Israel to withdraw its troops from Lebanon
without any conditions.
</P>
<P>
The last summit between the two country's presidents mainly
focused on the Israeli offer and their joint position over the
issue.
</P>
<P>
Through the expanded summit, the agency said, Syrian leaders
are expected to solve differences among bickering Lebanese troika
members with Hrawi and House Speaker Nabih Berry on one side,
and Prime Minister Rafik Hariri on the other.
</P>
<P>
Their disputes stemmed from Hrawi's controversial civil marriage
bill which Hariri has so far refused to endorse and the
religious leaders sharply attacked.
</P>
<P>
Under Hrawi's proposal, civil issues as marriage and divorce
will be authorized by government institutions rather than
religious courts.
</P>
<P>
Hariri said that he was not opposed to the civil marriage
itself, but the improper timing of the proposal, especially when
the country is facing the Israeli occupation in south Lebanon and
challenges at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
Religious leaders denounced Hrawi's proposal as "sacrilegious"
and vowed to spare no efforts to turn it down.
</P>
<P>
The house speaker agreed with Hrawi on the bill which was
believed to be "an important step" toward eventually eliminating
the country's sectarianism.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that al-Assad would ask Lebanese leaders to put
aside the civil marriage law and concentrate their attention on
the Israeli "maneuver."
</P>
<P>
Syria, with its about 40,000 troops deployed across Lebanon, is
the main power broker in the country.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Soldiers' Presence in Mozambique Denied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Angolan Ambassador to Mozambique
Antonio de Carvalho, Thursday rejected a report which claimed
that there are Angolan soldiers in Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
"There is not a single soldier of the Angolan armed forces in
Mozambique," Carvalho said in a statement release here,
Mozambican News Agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
If the reported soldiers do xis there, he said, they would
be forces out of the control of the Angolan government.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Demos weekly, the Mozambique Resistance
Movement (Renamo) Chairman Afonso Dhlakama claimed that 15
well-trained Angolan soldiers had entered central and northern
Mozambique, with an aim of sabotaging the local elections.
</P>
<P>
Dhlakama was quoted by the April 1 edition of the weekly as
saying that the Angolan soldiers had entered the country on the
pretext of military cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan ambassador squarely denied the charge, saying that
Dhlakama's words were causing chaos and misleading the public.
</P>
<P>
Carvalho said that his government sincerely wished that
Mozambique's local election could proceed in the principle of
democracy.

<HEADLINE> PNA Repeats Call on U.S. to Publicize Peace Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) repeated its call on Thursday on the United States
to make public its peace initiative about Israeli troop pullback
in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Nabil Abu Rudeineh, spokesman for PNA President Yasser Arafat,
said in Gaza that the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks has reached
a crucial stage and Washington should act swiftly and decisively
to save the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Rudeineh's remarks followed those made by PNA senior negotiator
Hasan Asfour on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Asfour stressed that the U.S. should not take advantage of
PNA's soft line and bow to the Israeli pressure.
</P>
<P>
Washington has reportedly outlined a plan calling on Israel to
withdraw from 13.1 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross tried to sell the reported plan
to the Palestinians and Israel last month in an intensive
shuttling mission.
</P>
<P>
But he failed to win the acceptance from Israel, which said it
would not withdraw troops from more than 9 percent of the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has reportedly revised its plan. The new one would ask
Israel to pull back troops from 9 percent of Area C in the West
Bank now under total Israeli control, plus 3 percent of the
so-called Area C-. Israel will retain security control over Area
C-, while the PNA will be given broad civilian control, including
the right of issuing building permits.
</P>
<P>
Media Reports said that Ross would renew his effort to narrow
the gap between the Palestinians and Israel in another mission
starting in about 10 days.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Israeli Kitchen Cabinet was discussing the
U.S. plan. No details have been disclosed. But the Jerusalem Post
daily said on Thursday that the Jewish state is considering to
accept the revised U.S. peace plan.

ADDIS ABABA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of African
Unity (OAU) Thursday granted Madagascar 409,000 U.S. Dollars as

<HEADLINE> President Moi Praises Somali Leaders for Unity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
Thursday congratulated Somali leaders in Benadir region "for
uniting and agreeing to follow the path of peace according to his
advice," the Kenya News Agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Main factional leaders of Somalia who are in Kenya told
reporters Wednesday that they were in the process of establishing
a central authority within the Benadir region including Mogadishu
and its environs.
</P>
<P>
Moi said that his main concern was peace for the people of
Somalia who, he noted, had suffered for too long.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan president was talking with the four main political
leaders of Benadir region who called on him Thursday in Nakuru,
about 165 kilometers northwest of Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held Wednesday in Nairobi, factional
leader Hussein Aideed and his allies Osman Ali Atto and Mohammed
Qanyare Afrah, and his rival Ali Mahdi Mohammed expressed their
determination to pursue the path of peace in order to resolve
their differences.
</P>
<P>
The Somali leaders who arrived here on Tuesday said that they
had so far agreed on the administrational structure of Mogadishu,
the Charter and the administration build-up of the city's main
installations such as seaport and airport which have been closed
since 1995.
</P>
<P>
They disclosed that they had invited President Moi to perform
the official reopening of seaport and airport in Mogadishu,
saying that "his physical presence in Mogadishu will be a great
symbol to both the local and the international community of our
determination to restore peace."
</P>
<P>
So far, Kenya has made no mention of Moi's response to the
invitation to tour the war-torn Horn of Africa country.
</P>
<P>
The Somali leaders said that they are determined to have the
Baidoa Peace Conference succeed after two previous postponements
as the conference is an important step in a peace accord reached
in Cairo last December.
</P>
<P>
The Baidoa Conference is scheduled to start on May 15, but the
visiting leaders said that it was in jeopardy due to a lack of
financial and other resources.
</P>
<P>
The four Somali leaders appealed President Moi as an elder
statesman to approach friendly countries and international
organizations for financial and technical assistance in order to
make this initiative a success.
</P>
<P>
Moi is Chairman of the Inter-Governmental Authority on
Development (IGAD), which is aimed at mediating in the conflicts
of Somalia and Sudan.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Records Poor Coffee Production in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria recorded the worst coffee
production since 1991 last year, the national president of the
Coffee and Tea Association, Alhaji Ibrahim Saddiq, has said.
</P>
<P>
Saddiq told the official News Agency of Nigeria Monday in
Jalingo, Adamawa State, in east Nigeria that an unknown pest
stroke most of the coffee farms in the area, thus reducing the
production level to about 45 percent.
</P>
<P>
Between 1991 and 1996, Nigeria was producing over 250,000 tons
of coffee beans annually, he said.
</P>
<P>
He regretted that financial constraints and lack of government
assistance has prevented the association from developing more
lands for coffee production.
</P>
<P>
The association had planned to develop 98,000 hectares of
farmlands into coffee farms between 1994 and 1996, but Saddiq
said only 44,000 hectares have been actually developed.
</P>
<P>
The official also decried the smuggling activity on the
Nigerian and Camerounian border, noting that over 200,000 tons of
coffee was smuggled into Cameroun, Chad and Central Africa
Republic annually.
</P>
<P>
Poor harvest and smuggling will affect the country's export
earnings, Saddiq said.

<HEADLINE> Liberia Denies Training of S. Leone Junta Forces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Liberia Thursday denied accusation
that it is training the remnants of Sierra Leone's junta forces
and allied rebels for fighting against the west African
peacekeeping force known as ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
"There is no training course in the country and the Liberian
government has absolutely no interest in any part of the war in
Sierra Leone," said Liberian Defense Minister Daniel Chia, quoted
by the British Broadcasting Corporation monitored here.
</P>
<P>
An ECOMOG commander in charge of eastern and southern Sierra
Leone, Col. Buhari Musa Wednesday alleged that more than 3,000
junta forces and rebels are being trained in northern Liberia's
Lofa County.
</P>
<P>
He put the blame on the Liberian government for ECOMOG's slow
progress in mopping up the junta forces and rebels.
</P>
<P>
However, Chia said that Liberia is a country of principle and
the "very very big lesson" Liberians learned from their seven
years of civil war is the country will not be interested in
fighting in Sierra Leone as far as the situation in the
sub-region is concerned.
</P>
<P>
He said his government has in recent weeks deployed some
forces along the border with Sierra Leone and Lofa County to help
the immigration forces to control the influx of Sierra Leone
refugees.
</P>
<P>
There has long been a rift between ECOMOG and the Liberian
government led by President Charles Taylor, whose fighting
against the former government triggered off the country's bloody
civil war at the end of 1989.
</P>
<P>
With the growing hostilitiy of the Liberian government, ECOMOG
has planned to move its headquarters from the Liberian capital
Monrovia to Freetown, capital of Sierra Leone.

<HEADLINE> India Attaches Highest Priority to Nuclear </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The Elimination of nuclear
weapons and other weapons of mass destruction is the most
important objective on the international disarmament agenda.
Indian Representative Savitrt Kunadi said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the plenary meeting of the United Nations
Disarmament Commission, the representative said that while the
international community had made considerable headway towards the
disarmament of chemical and biological weapons, efforts to
eliminate unclear weapons would continue to require decisive
action.
</P>
<P>
The representative said the world must work towards a
universal, indivisible prohibition of the use of all weapons of
mass destruction, and it could not allow the successes achieved in
the elimination of chemical and biological weapons to serve as
justification for the continued retention and possible use of
unclear weapons against the perceived threat of other weapons of
mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
She said that India had proposed the immediate conclusion of an
internationally binding agreement prohibiting the use of nuclear
weapons, pending their complete elimination.
</P>
<P>
On a fourth special session on disarmament, she said it would
offer the international community an opportunity to review the
current international situation and to assess the most critical
aspects of the disarmament process.
</P>
<P>
The session should address priority disarmament issues and come
up with a positive and forward-looking program, to provide an
organic continuum between the tasks agreed upon in the past and a
program of action for the future, she added.

<HEADLINE> Greek Parliament Approves Bill to Reform Ailing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Greece's parliament approved
Thursday a bill to restructure the debt-ridden national carrier,
Olympic Airways (OA), as part of the Greek government's efforts to
qualify the targets for the European Economic and Monetary Union
(EMU).
</P>
<P>
The bill was carried by 158 votes with 124 against.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, the Greek government will be able to implement
its five-year plan to restructure the ailing national airline
including a three-year wage freeze and wage cuts totaling 5.5
billion drachmas (about 16.9 million U.S. dollars) as well as
flexible working hours.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in parliament, Greek National Economy and Finance
Minister Yiannos Papantoniou said that the OA would serve as an
example for the other public utilities and organizations in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The airline, which currently employs 7,250 people including 950
flight attendants, is estimated to have a debt of about 600
billion drachmas (about 1.8 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
If the restructure plan was implemented well, the OA would have
profits of 74.5 billion drachmas (about 229 million dollars) in
the next five years.

<HEADLINE> WFP Appeals for Urgent Contributions to Feed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations World Food
Program (WFP) Thursday urged the international donor community to
make contributions to feed some 800,000 Ethiopians suffering from
poor harvests.
</P>
<P>
WFP signed an agreement with the Ethiopian government at the
end of March to provide a total of 60,000 tons of relief food to
the victims of first drought and then heavy rains in the eastern
and lowland regions of Tigray and Amhara.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued here Thursday quoted Khaled Adly, WFP's
Country Director for Ethiopia, as saying that "at this point
we've got less than five percent of the contributions we need."
</P>
<P>
The poor 1997 short rains from January to mid May and the
erratic and inadequate rainfall from July to August, drastically
reduced Ethiopia's two harvests while heavy unseasonable rains in
October to November caused damage to the mature crops in the
fields.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the release said, the Meher crop, which is
harvested between December and January and represents 90-95
percent of Ethiopia's annual grain production, dropped by 26
percent, or from 11.8 million tons last year to 8.8 million tons
this year.
</P>
<P>
At present, it was estimated that WFP would need 57,500 tons
of food for its relief operation which would run from May through
October this year.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia with a population of 58 million is estimated to have
more than two million people who are chronically food insecure
and up to eight million people who face periodic food shortages.
</P>
<P>
Over the last three years, WFP has provided 138,000 tons of
relief food aid in areas where farmers have suffered crop
failures and shortage of pasture.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Calls for Rwanda Inquiry Resumption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Thursday adopted a resolution requesting Secretary-General Kofi
Annan to reactivate U.N. inquiry on arms flows to Rwanda in an
effort to arrest continued violence in the country.
</P>
<P>
The council recognized "the need for a renewed investigation of
the illegal flow of arms to Rwanda, which is fueling violence and
could lead to further acts of genocide," the resolution said.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations imposed an arms embargo on Rwanda in May
1994 amid a Hutu-led genocide which eventually killed some 500,000
ethnics, mainly Tutsis.
</P>
<P>
To look into violations of the embargo, the U.N. set up the
Commission of Inquiry on Arms Flows to Rwanda in 1995, which
carried out its investigation through September 1996 when the work
had to be suspended because of violence in October 1996 in
neighboring Congo, formerly Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Since 1966, the former Rwanda army and militias have dispersed
widely throughout central Africa and reportedly have forged new
links with other insurgents in the region. Continuing violence has
been observed in Rwanda and the Great Lakes region, including
Burundi.
</P>
<P>
The resolution calls on all states in the Great Lakes region to
ensure that their territory is not used as a base for armed groups
to launch illegal incursions or attacks against any other state.
</P>
<P>
It gives the U.N. secretary-general a maximum of six months
since the reactivation of the commission to report to the council
on follow-up recommendations.

ATHENS, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Greece's consumer price inflation
in March increased from 4.3 percent in February to 4.6 percent,
according to figures released by the Greek National Statistics

</P>
<P>
The NSS attributed the rise in inflation to a 6.0-7.0 percent
rise in car prices and some foodstuffs.

The inflation was expected to continue rising in April
following the drachma's devaluation by 14 percent in March, but it
would resume its downward trend in May, said the NSS.

TEHRAN, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Akbar
Khamenei has summoned the heads of the three branches of the
government to exchange views on the issue of the Tehran mayor, who
had been arrested on charges of embezzlement.
</P>
<P>
The office of the supreme leader issued a communique, saying
that Khamenei summoned the heads of the executive, the legislative
and the judiciary to discuss the issue on Wednesday night, Iran's
news agency IRNA reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
President Mohammad Khatami, Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar
Nateq-Nouri and Chief Justice Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi were
summoned by Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
Hashemi Rafsanjani, former president and head of the Expediency
Council, was also present at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Tehran mayor, Gholambossein Karbaschi, was reportedly
arrested last Saturday after he attended a court session
investigating into charges brought against him of embezzlement and
misappropriation of public funds by city council officials.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Khamenei asked the heads of the executive
and judiciary branches to coordinate fully in the matters related
to the case. He said that the two sides needed to fully observe
laws and justice and then submit a full report to him immediately.
</P>
<P>
The three heads are expected to hold a meeting soon to discuss
the issue in accordance with the instructions of the supreme leader.
</P>
<P>
Karbaschi, a close ally of Khatami, played a major role in
Khatami's election victory last year.
</P>
<P>
An Iranian court has accused the 44-year-old mayor of involving
in a huge corruption scandal. But Karbaschi has said the allegations
against him are politically motivated.
</P>
<P>
The hard-line faction that supported Nateq-Nouri in last year's
presidential election spearheaded the campaign against Karbaschi
and the Tehran municipality.

<HEADLINE> Portugal to Train Army Officers for Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Portuguese Defense
Minister Veiga Simao announced here Thursday that his government
will help train Angolan army officers through establishing
military academies in the southern African country.
</P>
<P>
Simao made this announcement to the media after his meeting
with Angolan President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos. Modern teaching
techniques will be used in the new academies to achieve results
comparable to those in Portugal, the defense minister said.
</P>
<P>
As to the aviation school to be established with the help of
Portugal in Angola's coastal city Lobito, Simao said that a study
group of three Portuguese officers will make an inspection tour
to Lobito soon to resolve the existing problems, making sure that
the school be opened as scheduled on May 6.
</P>
<P>
Besides establishing such schools, Simao said, Portugal is
planning to enroll Angolan students in its own military academies
to help train high-level commanding officers. The number of the
Angolan military personnel studying in the navy school, army
school and airforce school will increase from 150 to 250.
</P>
<P>
The Portuguese defense minister said that his government will
also provide Angola with military medical assistance.
</P>
<P>
Angolan Defense Minister Pedro Sebastiao highly praised the
role Portugal has played in the implementation of the 1994 Lusaka
Peace Accord and the military cooperation between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
As one of the three observers on the Angolan peace process,
Portugal has sent troops to the United Nations peacekeeping
forces, showing that the Portuguese always stand by the side of
the Angolans, Sebastiao said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the military cooperation between the two nations
began to be strengthened in 1986. And since then, the capacity
and capability of the Angolan military institutions have been
greatly improved.
</P>
<P>
Presently, Portugal and Angola are implementing 1998/1999
biannual military technology cooperation program. They will
further develop their military relationship by carrying out
multiple cooperation projects.
</P>
<P>
Simao arrived in Luanda on Wednesday for a three-day visit to
Angola.
</P>
<P>
The Portuguese defense minister also held talks with Angolan
Prime Minister Franca Van-Dunem and Vice President of the
People's Assembly Lazaro Dias on Thursday.

<P>
LONDON, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Down House, home of Charles Darwin,
one of the world's greatest thinkers, will re-open to the public
on Friday April 10, following an intensive restoration program by
English Heritage.
</P>
<P>
Located in Kent, Down House is where Darwin had lived for 40
years with his family, and where he wrote his famous book, On the
Origin Of Species, English Heritage has told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The principal ground floor rooms of the building have been
closely restored to resemble the original in 1876-77, the last
years of Darwin's life.
</P>
<P>
In contrast to the ground floor, seven of the upstairs rooms
present a contemporary exhibition devoted to different aspects of
Darwin's life and work.
</P>
<P>
English Heritage, the national body responsible for protection
of historical environment, acquired Down House in May 1996, when
the British government's Grade I listed building was found to be
in a state of disrepair.
</P>
<P>
The two-year restoration had cost 2.2 million pounds (3.5
million U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> European Shares End higher on Dow's Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Major stock markets in Europe
reversed Wednesday's declining trend and ended higher Thursday,
supported by Wall Street's opening rally, but with volumes
relatively thin before the Easter holiday.
</P>
<P>
Britain's FTSE-100 index of leading shares closed 50.3 points
or 0.83 percent up at 6,105.5, a rise of 41.3 over last Friday,
boosted by a firm Wall Street opening and the Bank of England's
decision Thursday to leave interest rates on hold at 7.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
Banks and financial sectors were among the best performers with
fund managers particularly strong amid talks of bid moves on
Perpetual and M&AMP;G Group.
</P>
<P>
Volume was predictably low, with many players squaring
positions or staying on the sidelines ahead of the long Easter
weekend.
</P>
<P>
German shares on the Frankfurt market ended 47.76 points or
0.91 percent higher at 5,317.22, above the psychologically
important 5,300-point level following a late rally in afternoon
trade.
</P>
<P>
Daimler-Benz was among the top gainers, with its shares up 2.6
percent following release Wednesday of the company's rosy sales
prospect.
</P>
<P>
The Paris CAC-40 index reversed an initial dip and managed to
claw its way back into positive territory by the close of the
session on the back of the Dow's recovering from recent weakness.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that shares of industries strongly tied to the
dollar were among the biggest movers, but activity was relatively
light ahead of the four-day Easter holiday starting from Friday
and after two sessions of consolidation.
</P>
<P>
The CAC-40 index closed at 3894.48, up 20.61 points or 0.53
percent, but 37.54 lower on last Friday.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: PNA-Hamas Feud Heats up over Death of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The feud between the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) and Hamas heated up as the radical group
accuses the PNA of collaborating with Israel in killing its chief
bombmaker and Palestinian police detained its leader on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Abdel Aziz Rantisi, Hamas leader in Gaza, was arrested for
interrogation about a statement issued by the Islamic Resistance
Movement against Palestinian national interests and the PNA, a
senior Palestinian police officer said on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
This has indicated that tensions are growing between the PNA
and Hamas after last month's death of Muhi Sharif, one of Hamas'
leading activists.
</P>
<P>
Hamas statement issued on Thursday accused the PNA of
collaborating with Israel in killing Sharif and called for the
resignation of several Palestinian officials, including Jibril
Rajoub, head of the Palestinian security forces in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday night, Hamas released a videotape of a masked man who
identified himself as Awad Awaddalah who was accused by PNA
officials of assassinating Sharif.
</P>
<P>
Awaddalah slammed Rajoub for using torture to extract
information about Sharif's death from imprisoned Hamas members.
</P>
<P>
Sharif, most wanted by Israel, which accused him of
masterminding suicide bombing attacks killing dozens of Israelis,
was found dead on March 29 in an explosive-rigged car detonated by
a remote control in the West Bank city of Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
Hamas has held Israel responsible for the killing and vowed to
avenge Sharif's death by attacking Jewish targets both inside and
outside Israel.
</P>
<P>
But the PNA said earlier that it has found Sharif was murdered
by his fellow members in an internal struggle for Hamas leadership.
</P>
<P>
Hamas has rejected the findings as lies and accused the PNA,
Rajoub in particular, of collaborating with Israel in killing
Sharif in an attempt to prevent him from launching new suicide
bombing attacks in Israel.
</P>
<P>
PNA's Cabinet Secretary Tayeb Abdel Rahim Wednesday dismissed
Hamas' allegations. He blamed Hamas leadership abroad for trying
to deflect attention from the group's internal strife.
</P>
<P>
"They know the truth about the killing of Muhi Sharif, but they
are trying to stir things up because they are in a very difficult
situation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hamas, which is increasing its influence in the Palestinian
self-rule territories, is strongly opposed to PNA's process to
make peace with Israel and calls for armed struggles to liberate
the territories from Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
The PNA, on the one hand, is cracking down on Hamas by
arresting its activists and closing its institutions, curbing
violence against Israel, which accused the PNA of not doing enough
to fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it has been holding talks with Hamas, trying to win
its cooperation in restoring the rights of the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
But the latest feud between the two sides is feared to strike a
heavy blow to their relations and has aroused deep concern that
the confrontation could lead to violent conflicts within the
Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Refugees in Starvation: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 9 (Xinhua) -- While the thousands of refugees
fleeing the eastern part of Sierra Leone are suffering from
starvation, hundreds of them have already died, the British
Broadcasting Corporation reported Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted the director of information in the
government information services as saying that there are now over
20,000 Sierra Leonean refugees living in two towns along the
Guinean border and hundreds of them are sleeping in the open air
because of the overpopulation in the border towns.
</P>
<P>
There are neither food nor medicine for the refugees and the
people are dying from pneumonia and hypertension as well as other
diseases, the information director said.
</P>
<P>
However, no immediate improvement of the poor situation is
expected due to the poor transportation conditions in eastern
Sierra Leone, according to the United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees (UNHCR).
</P>
<P>
What makes the situation even worse is the UNHCR decision to
suspend repatriation of Sierra Leonean refugees from Guinea until
further notice.
</P>
<P>
The tickets issued to registered would-be returnee refugees
have been re-sold to businessmen and women from Sierra Leone who
since the overthrow of the junta have restarted their lucrative
cross-border trade between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The new trader-onwers of these tickets would then pack their
bags and baggages of commercial items into the UNHCR hired buses,
thereby evading the customs charges on both sides of the border.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the west African peacekeeping force ECOMOG is
continuing its advance towards Kailahun district, a diamond-rich
area in eastern Sierra Leone currently in the hands of the
remnants of the junta forces and allied rebels.
</P>
<P>
Two strategic towns in the district, Mende Kalema and Niema,
have fallen to ECOMOG.

<HEADLINE> US Criticizes Critics of US Ambassador in Athens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Greek politicians who object to
the outspoken opinions of U.S. Ambassador Nicholas Burns are
"almost antidemocratic," the State Department said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Greece is the cradle of democracy in the world, and one of the
principles of democracy is that governments and people should be
able to express their views freely," said James Rubin, who
replaced Burns as the State Department spokesman last year.
</P>
<P>
Parliament speaker Apostolos Kaklamanis said Monday that Burns
acted like an "anthippatos," which in ancient Greek was used to
describe a deputy governor of Imperial Rome.
</P>
<P>
"He is an ambassador, but he behaves like an anthippatos,"
Kaklamanis said, interrupting Deputy Foreign Minister George
Papandreou while he was addressing parliament.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said it was "ridiculous" to suggest that Burns should not
go public with American concerns about Greek policy.
</P>
<P>
Burns caused an outcry by giving a speech warning that recent
terrorist attacks against American businesses in Greece could harm
investor confidence. He also said Greece's labor laws were an
obstacle to foreign investment.

Rantisi's family members were quoted as saying that police took
him away from his house.
</P>
<P>
Police sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he was
detained for questioning about statements he made against the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) regarding the death of
Hamas leading bombmaker Muhi Sharif.
</P>
<P>
Sharif was killed in mysterious circumstances in the West Bank
city of Ramallah on March 29.
</P>
<P>
Rantisi said earlier that the Palestinian investigation team,
which found Sharif's body, fabricated the findings, which said
Sharif was killed by his fellow Hamas activists in an internal
power struggle.
</P>
<P>
Rantisi said that some senior PNA members, who were involved in
the investigation, should be put on trial.
</P>
<P>
Hamas has said that the PNA had collaborated with Israel in the
murder of Sharif. But it insisted that Israel should be
responsible for his death and vowed to launch terrorist attacks
against Israel.
</P>

This was the second time that Rantisi was taken to the police
office after Sharif's death.

<HEADLINE> Weekend Activities Enrich Beijing Resident' Lives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 10 (Xinhua) -- To most Beijingers, housebound
weekends have become a thing of the past, as now there are
numerous programs available for them to enjoy themselves during
weekends.
</P>
<P>
A survey of 607 local residents aged between 16 and 35 has
disclosed the colorful lives Beijingers live nowadays.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows that over 70 percent of the respondents read
books and newspapers or watch TV programs, and 10-39
percent of the surveyed use computers, do exercises, attend
gatherings of friends or travel during weekends.
</P>
<P>
Experts have pointed out that in the not-too-distant past many
people did household chores or just slept late during weekends
since they had no time or were too tired to do other things.
</P>
<P>
Now, with the improvement of people's living
standards, many people think it is necessary to enrich their
cultural lives.
</P>
<P>
Since 1996 the Beijing Municipal Government has worked out
plans to promote wholesome weekend activities.
</P>
<P>
To date, there are more than 100 stadiums open to the public
during weekends, receiving over 1.5 million visitors monthly.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 12 local professional art groups gave
performances at weekends.
</P>
<P>
The China Puppet Show Theater's weekend performances have
attracted 100,000 children; some opera theaters have also started
weekend performances.
</P>
<P>
The "Weekend Reading Contest" program, which has been held among
local families for several years, has attracted hundreds of
thousands of families this year with its new programs including
offering guidance in purchasing books and establishing household
book shelves.
</P>
<P>
To attract more visitors at weekends, 50 of the 100 local
museums provide free and 50 percent-discount tickets for children
and students, and preferential annual tickets to citizens, in
addition to their efforts to improve their interior facilities and
increase their exhibits.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the city has opened 44 tourism routes leading to
suburban villages for urbanites to observe and learn from real
rural life while enjoying beautiful scenery.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers and television have also joined the efforts to
publicize weekend programs for residents.

operation today, with the first furnace-load of molten steel cast
into blank plate.
</P>
<P>
The project, involving a total investment of six billion yuan,
includes two 250-ton converters and two 1,450-mm
continuous-casting machines. It has a designed capacity of
three million tons of molten steel and 2.8 million tons
of blank plate a year.
</P>
<P>
It will provide raw materials for a hot rolling mill -- another
key project of the phase which will boost the complex' annual
steel output to 10 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Baogang, located on the northeastern outskirts of Shanghai, is
a large modern iron and steel complex built up initially with
imported equipment and technology. Construction of the complex
started in December 1978, and the first and second phases of its
construction were completed in 1985 and 1991, respectively.

<HEADLINE> Russia Duma Fails to Approve Kiriyenko as Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The Russian State Duma (lower
house of parliament) Friday failed to approve Sergei Kiriyenko as
prime minister in its first ballot.
</P>
<P>
According to the Itar-Tass news agency, Kiriyenko gained only
143 votes, while 186 deputies voted against him and five abstained.
</P>
<P>
The premier's candidacy requires 226 votes in the 450-seat
State Duma to win approval.
</P>
<P>
The result however still appeared better than predicted.
</P>
<P>
Before the poll, leaders of factions and groups in the Duma
differed on the confirmation of Kiriyenko, who was nominated by
president Boris Yeltsin as premier after he dismissed the entire
cabinet on March 23.
</P>
<P>
A majority of groups, including the Communist Party of Russian
Federation (KPRF), Yabloko, Liberal Democratic Party of Russia
(LDPR) and the Agrarians were against Kiriyenko's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
The "Our Home is Russia" (NDR) faction decided to back
Kiriyenko. Its leader Alexander Shokhin said they made the
decision because they thought the country should not be without a
government for too long a period.
</P>
<P>
The LDPR decided not to vote for Kiriyenko shortly before the
vote was taken. Its leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who earlier
pledged to back Kiriyenko, said his party will not support him
even if Yeltsin submits his candidacy once again.
</P>
<P>
They made the decision because Kiriyenko refused to promise at
least "two secondary ministerial portfolios" to the party, he said.
</P>
<P>
A Kremlin spokesman said Yeltsin immediately nominated
Kiriyenko again following the Duma's rejection.
</P>
<P>
If the Duma declines to confirm Yeltsin's nomination after
three votings, the president is empowered to dissolve the Duma and
call for early elections.

<P>
HONG KONG, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Byron Black of Zimbabwe added
one more big win to his Davis Cup victory last week over U.S. Open
champion Pat Rafter, sweeping into the semi-finals of the Salem
Open in Hong Kong Friday.
</P>
<P>
The 28-year-old from Harare won the match with two sets to none
over seventh-seeded Italian Gianluca Pozzi.
</P>
<P>
Black on Thursday downed American Christian Vinck, who upset
the week-long tournament's top seed Michael Chang in the first
round.
</P>
<P>
Black's victory further slimmed the ranks of survived seeds to
only two.
</P>
<P>
With his upset win over Rafter, Black, now ranked 81st in the
world, helped Zimbabwe to a shock world group first round victory
over Australia. He now faces Canada's Sebastien Lareau in the
semi-finals here Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Lareau, world number 112, ousted Spain's Oscar Burrieza 6-1,
7-6.
</P>
<P>
The weekend's other semi-final will be contested by the event's
last two seeds left -- third seed Thomas Johansson of Sweden and
eighth seed Kenneth Carlsen of Denmark.
</P>
<P>
Johansson, ranked 43rd, beat Australian Sandon Stolle 7-6, 7-5
while 76th-ranked Carlsen beat South African qualifier Neville
Godwin from South Africa 7-5, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
Godwin was seeking a further run forward after beating
second-seeded German Tommy Haas in the first round.
</P>
<P>
"If I serve and return the way I did today I have a good chance
of winning the tournament," said Johansson, the losing
semi-finalist last year in the hands of eventual winner Michael
Chang.
</P>
<P>
"Now I am trying to make the most of my confidence," said Black
after the match.
</P>
<P>
"I have won a grand slam title at doubles (the 1994 French
Open) and the main priority for the rest of my career will be
doing well in singles," he added.

Thapa, Radio Nepal said.
</P>
<P>
The King has asked Thapa to look after the care-taker
government until a new government is formed.
</P>
<P>
The King has called upon members of the Lower House of
parliament who can muster a simple majority of 103 votes in the
Lower House to stake a claim to power by 18:00 p.m., April 12,
Radio Nepal said.

Under an agreement reached before he went to power last
October, Thapa should hand over the leadership of the government
to the NC.
</P>
<P>
The coalition government headed by Thapa comprises the NC, the
National Democratic Party and the Nepal Sadbhavana Party.
</P>
<P>
Now the NC is seeking alliance with other political parties in
the country to form a new coalition under its leadership.

<HEADLINE> Funds to Be Raised for Huge Railway Construction Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Railway Construction Fund (RCF),
bank loans and overseas funding will constitute the sources of the
245 billion yuan (about 29.5 billion U.S. dollars) China plans to
invest in railway construction in the coming five years, today's
"Economic Information Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the fulfilment of the ambitious plan, the Ministry of
Railways has decided to raise the charge for every ton/km of goods
transported from the previous 0.028 yuan to 0.033 yuan (8.3 yuan
equals one US dollar) over a five-year period which started in
April. This is expected to raise 220 billion yuan for the RCF.
</P>
<P>
Several months ago, the Development Bank of China decided to
issue loans totalling 7.65 billion yuan for the railway construction
plan. However, this is thought to be inadequate, and talks are
under way for increasing the amount.
</P>
<P>
In addition, 15 billion yuan-worth of railway construction
bonds are scheduled to be issued.
</P>
<P>
The railway construction plan also expects to use a total of
2.4 billion U.S. dollars of foreign funding for the plan from
sources including the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and
foreign governments.

<HEADLINE> Human Activity on Hainan Traced Back 10,000 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, April 10 (Xinhua) -- New archaeological findings
suggest that the history of human activity on Hainan, an island
province in south China, can be traced back more than 10,000
years.
</P>
<P>
Thirteen fossilized human teeth, nearly 70,000 animal fossils
and a large number of stone tools and bone implements were found
in a cave, 15 km from Sanya City in the south of the island in
1992 and 1993.
</P>
<P>
After four years of research, archaeologists determined that
the teeth belonged to people of different ages. The size and
structure of the teeth are similar to those of modern humans,
according to the archaeologists.
</P>
<P>
Fossils of Asian elephants and South China tigers, both of
them endangered species today, have also been discovered on the
island.
</P>
<P>
The archaeologists determined that the animals lived in the
late period of the Old Stone Age, more than 10,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Based on the discoveries, the archaeologists believe that the
primitive men of those times were hunters who lived in caves and
had discovered the use of fire.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 10 (Xinhua) -- China Social Sciences Literature
Publishing House, which is known as "an advisor" of the Communist
Party Central Committee and the State Council, has published a
yearbook on the Mid-East and Africa, indicating its interest in
the regions and the situation there.
</P>
<P>
The "Development Report on the Mid-East and Africa" was
produced by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS), the
Foreign Affairs Ministry, the Foreign Economic and Trade
Cooperation Ministry, and the Chinese Communist Party Central
Committee's International Liaison Department.
</P>
<P>
The book's chief editor and director of CASS's West Asia and
Africa Institute, Zhao Guozhong, explains the reason for the book
by saying that the Mid-East and Africa have been major regions of
unrest and have remained complicated, unstable, and uncertain
areas after the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
The 300-page report analyses the situation there, the peace
process, changes in international relations, UN peace-keeping
efforts, and internal political affairs like elections in Iran and
civil wars in Zaire and the Congo.
</P>
<P>
It also discusses oil production in the Gulf Region and trade,
labor, and investment prospects, along with the Western powers'
strategies for seizing power there.
</P>
<P>
The political framework the U.S. created by taking advantage of
the end of the Cold War and the victory in the Gulf War can no
longer be maintained, it says, and China is playing a more active
role in safeguarding stability and peace in the regions. Zhao says
that after the 1991 Gulf War, scholars discussed the political and
economic situations in the Mid-East and Africa every year in
Beijing and have published reports on these talks.
</P>
<P>
The book also points to the significance of the establishment
of diplomatic relations between China and South Africa this year.

SEOUL, April 10 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's Samsung Corp. has
decided to sell its heavy equipment plant to Sweden's Volvo Corp.
in order to pay its debts and strengthen its business, the South
Korean Securities Supervisory Board said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Swedish firm has agreed to take over the entire workforce

rights, inventory, equipment and debts.
</P>
<P>
Volvo will be allowed to use the original brand name for three
years from the date of the take-over and Samsung will not engage

</P>
<P>
The 766.9 million U.S. dollar deal is expected to be completed
by the end of May, the board said.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's top 30 chaebols, or conglomerates, are blamed for
devouring bank loans by overexpanding and shirking responsibility
by allowing debts to accumulate, which eventually lead to the
lingering financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The 30 family-owned chaebols owed a total of 111.27 trillion
won (some 1.8 billion U.S. dollars) to banks in 1997, a surge of
43 percent from 77.81 trillion won in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi FM Lashes Out at British Attempt as Dubious </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Foreign Minister Saeed
al-Sahhaf termed as dubious a British attempt to hold a meeting on
better implementing the Iraq-U.N. oil-for-food program, the Iraqi
News Agency (INA) reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sahhaf said that in terms of its declared and undeclared
objectives of the conference scheduled to be convened in London
late this month, it has been considered dubious by Iraq since
Britain was not a neutral state or even committed to lifting the
sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He was replying a question raised by an INA political editor.
He said Iraq has lived up to all its obligations under all the
U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
He accused Britain of seeking "to release a string of
aggressive statements, fabrications and lies" and massing up
massive marine and other troops in the Gulf with the aim of
setting the stage for a new American-British aggression against
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
During the February weapons inspection crisis, Britain sided
with the United States to threaten military action to force Iraqi
compliance with U.N. resolutions. The crisis was later defused by
U.N. chief Kofi Annan during his mission to Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Annan and Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz signed an
agreement February 23 on opening Iraqi presidential sites to
senior U.N. diplomats and arms inspectors, averting an imminent
U.S.-British air strike.
</P>
<P>
From March 26 to April 2, Iraq fully cooperated with a special
group of diplomats and experts in conducting baseline inspections
of its eight presidential sites. The inspectors found nothing.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sahhaf said "Iraq condemns this dubious move by Britain as
aiming to provide a congenial climate to maintain the embargo and
further encumbering it with restrictive terms in contradiction
with Security Council resolutions."
</P>
<P>
The scheduled conference proved beyond any doubt London's
involvement in the anti-Iraq scheme, he said, calling on all
invited parties to boycott the conference.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Aziz met with member of the British House of
Commons George Gallawy, who, according to INA, favored an
immediate and total lifting of sanctions against Iraq and hoped
this could be done by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Aziz commended the efforts being exerted by Gallawy and his
fellow parliamentarians and other figures in Britain, INA said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-imposed sanctions on Iraq after its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait cannot be lifted unless U.N. Special Commission on
disarming Iraq verifies that it has been free of prohibited
weapons of mass destruction.

following intervention by Japan's central bank.
</P>
<P>
The dollar was at one point knocked down to 127.40 yen, the
first time in about a month.
</P>
<P>
At 5 p.m., the dollar was quoted at 129.01-05 yen, down from
131.13-18 yen at 9 a.m. and 131.40-50 yen late Thursday in New
York.
</P>
<P>
A Japanese monetary official said the Bank of Japan (BOJ) sold
several billion dollars Friday. The intervention pushed the dollar
down.
</P>
<P>
With many overseas markets closed for the Easter holiday,
traders believe Japanese monetary authorities intervened
frequently by selling off dollars, since it was easier to make a
mark in the thin market.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Japan confirmed it had asked the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York to buy yen on its behalf after Japanese Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto announced new economy-boosting measures
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Monetary sources said that Japan is determined to continue
intervening in currency markets if the yen slides excessively
against the dollar.

<P>
HAIKOU, April 10 (Xinhua) -- South China's Hainan Province will
launch regular tours of the Xisha Islands late this year, a senior
provincial tourism official said here today.
</P>
<P>
The Xisha Islands, which are 330 km southeast of Hainan Island,
consist of 35 islands and islets, shoals and reefs.
</P>
<P>
The tour of the Xisha is one of Hainan's theme-tour programs this

Tourism Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Fresh water is available on Yongxing Island, the largest
island of the archipelago. The island can also accommodate

<P>
Visitors to the Xisha will take pleasure-boats for sightseeing,
with other planned activities including diving and fishing, he

<HEADLINE> International Clothing &AMP; Accessories Fair To Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The sixth session of the China
International Clothing and Accessories Fair (CHIC '98) is to
open here April 15, believed to be one of the world's top ten
activities of its kind.
</P>
<P>
Attending the four-day event will be business people and
industry representatives from 26 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
The fair has been held annually since 1993, and has
played an important role not only in helping increase trade and
cultural exchanges between China and overseas countries and regions,
but also in promoting the country's garment industry.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the implementation of effective measures, the fair is
expected to move in the direction of internationalization and
specialization.
</P>
<P>
More than 560 domestic and overseas garment and accessories
manufacturers will be represented at a garment exhibition covering
an area of 24,000 sq m and believed to be equal to the Hong Kong
Fashion Week as the largest show of its kind in China in terms of
exhibition area.
</P>
<P>
Business turnover registered directly during the last fair
reached 830 million yuan, with signed letters of intent worth 1.13
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
A number of colorful cultural activities to be staged during
the fair will include an evening gala of fashion culture, the third
session of the "Forum on World-Famous Fashion Labels'', the Fourth
China Modeling Contest, the Sixth "Brother Cup" China
International Young Designer Competition, and the announcement of
the 1998-1999 autumn-winter collection trends.
</P>
<P>
China continued to lead the world in the output of garments --
with nine billion items last year. It imported more than 1.1
billion U.S. dollars-worth of garments in 1997, up 10 percent over
1996, while its garment exports rose 26.8 percent over the 1996
figure to top 31.78 billion U.S. dollars last year.

<P>
MOSCOW, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
Friday once again nominated Sergei Kiriyenko as premier after the
State Duma (lower house of parliament) refused to approve his
nominee in the first attempt.
</P>
<P>
President's spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky told a press
conference that Yeltsin has sent a message to the State Duma
asking for new consideration of his second nomination.
</P>
<P>
The message was sent just one hour after the Duma turned down
the president's first nomination.
</P>
<P>
Under the Russian Constitution, the State Duma should start
considering the president's second candidate one week after the
first ballot failed.
</P>
<P>
The State Duma Friday rejected Kiriyenko as prime minister with
186 votes against, 143 votes for and five abstentions.
</P>
<P>
The nominee needs 226 out of the 450 votes in the Duma to win
approval.

<HEADLINE> Indiana Sees Opportunities in China, Governor Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 10 (Xinhua) -- China has changed greatly in the
last ten years, in last three years, and in last few months, said
Frank O'Bannon, governor of the U.S. State of Indiana, here this
evening.
</P>
<P>
"China is a great country, and it would be great to invest
here," he said in an interview with Xinhua shortly after a
reception given in his honor by the Chinese People's Association
for Friendship with Foreign Countries.
</P>
<P>
"We are visiting this time not only to promote trade, but we
also want to learn China's new policy about peace and
development," said O'Bannon, who is leading a delegation to China.
</P>
<P>
According to O'Bannon, an engineering company, the first
Indiana company to invest in China, has had investment and plants
here since 1978. So far, 12 companies from the state have
representatives in China, covering transportation, machinery,
chemicals and electronic equipment.
</P>
<P>
China is the 15th importer of Indiana's products, he noted. The
state's trade with China grew 69 percent last year to reach 200
million U.S. dollars-worth.
</P>
<P>
The delegation will fly to Hangzhou, capital of east China's
Zhejiang Province, to celebrate the ten-year province-state
relations between them tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
Their friendship was established on the basis of complementary
economies.
</P>
<P>
When asked if he would suggest to President Clinton that he
should visit Zhejiang during his June trip, O'Bannon joked that it
would be good for Clinton to visit Zhejiang, not only because of
its beautiful scenery, but also for its historic significance, as
ex-President Nixon and ex-Secretary of State Kissinger visited the
province shortly after they signed the first joint communique with
China.
</P>
<P>
He also said Clinton's visit would have a "positive impact" on
Sino-U.S. trade ties.

<P>
MOSCOW, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The Russian State Duma (lower
house of parliament) Friday failed to approve Sergei Kiriyenko as
prime minister with only 143 voting for the motion.
</P>
<P>
The vote results show that 186 deputies voted against Yeltsin's
nomination of 35-year-old Kiriyenko as premier and five deputies
abstained.
</P>
<P>
The nominee needs 226 votes in the 450-seat State Duma to win
approval.
</P>
<P>
Yabloko and two other parties boycotted the ballot.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin put forward Kiriyenko'
candidacy again soon after the parliament's rejection, said
Kremlin spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Gennady Selezny, speaker of the Duma, Yeltsin
said that "given the Duma's refusal to endorse my candidate ...I
ask you to examine the candidacy of Kiriyenko and give your
approval."
</P>
<P>
Kiriyenko was nominated by Yeltsin as prime minister after he
dismissed the entire cabinet on March 23.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 10 (Xinhua) -- China's Ministry of Health has
called for an immediate examination of the quality of iodine
supplement products available across the country, for some of them
have caused undesirable side-effects in more than 1,000 young
people.
</P>
<P>
In a circular issued today, the ministry urged local health
supervision departments to thoroughly investigate and control the
production and distribution of iodine supplement pills and health
foods that contain iodine.
</P>
<P>
"Sub-standard products must be cleared from the shelves as
soon as possible," the circular said.
</P>
<P>
The call comes in the wake of a series of cases in which young
students in several provinces fell ill after taking pills which
were claimed to cure iodine deficiency disorders (IDD), despite
warnings from anti-IDD agencies and experts.
</P>
<P>
"It's enough for IDD prevention for ordinary people to use
iodized salt. Iodine-rich pills should only be used by people who
need extra amounts of iodine, such as pregnant women and new-born
babies, and people who live in iodine-deficient areas," said
Hao Yang, an official in charge of IDD elimination work at the
ministry.
</P>
<P>
"Iodine supplement products should not be sold to school
students in the name of the government or prevention of IDD," Hao
said.
</P>
<P>
Investigations found some local organizations, even schools,
involved in illegal dealings in the products.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,680 people have been stricken with undesirable
side-effects in 11 reported cases in eight provinces since the
first was disclosed in Shandong Province on March 25, the ministry
said. The symptoms included vomiting, abdominal pain and
allergy.
</P>
<P>
"It's true that iodine may stimulate the intestines and
stomachs of some people. But improper methods, such as taking it
on an empty stomach, directly caused the illnesses," explained
Prof. Yan Yuqin, an IDD expert.
</P>
<P>
Hao Yang criticized the money-grubbing behavior of individual
sellers and producers, saying they "sometimes mislead customers to
take iodine unnecessarily and recklessly".
</P>
<P>
"Parents know that lack of iodine may harm their children's
intelligence. So they are eager to buy a product when they are
told it's helpful in this regard," Hao said.
</P>
<P>
China has more than 400 million people living in
iodine-deficient areas, accounting for 40 percent of the world's
total.
</P>
<P>
Hao worried that the cases, which have been repeatedly covered
by national and local media in recent days, might have an adverse
impact on the government's anti-IDD efforts.
</P>
<P>
"Nevertheless, the work has to be strengthened since the
Chinese government has promised the international community to
eliminate IDD by the year 2000," he noted.

COLOMBO, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Susanthika
Jayasinghe, who won a landmark 200m silver medal for Asian in the

</P>
<P>
The fair offered 51 major investment projects, involving a
total investment of more than five billion yuan.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Cho Soon Re-elected President of S. Korean Opposition Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 10 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's major opposition
Grand National Party (GNP) Friday re-elected Cho Soon, a former
Seoul mayor and economist, as its president.
</P>
<P>
Some 800 delegates at the national convention re-elected
70-year-old Cho as president, said to be the result of a
compromise by GNP factions.
</P>
<P>
The GNP currently enjoys 161 seats in the 299-member National
Assembly (the parliament).
</P>
<P>
Cho became the GNP leader after his small opposition party
merged with the then ruling party last October to create the GNP
in a bid to help GNP candidate Lee Hoi-chang win the 15th
presidential election last year.
</P>
<P>
In the past two months, Cho's opponents appealed for an open
competition for the GNP presidency but withdrew the demand amid
fears of splitting the party in the run up to the local elections
in June this year.
</P>
<P>
Anti-Cho forces in the GNP are expected to orchestrate an early
national convention if the party makes a weak showing in June's
local elections.
</P>
<P>
Apparently taking a possible resurgence of factional conflict
into consideration, Cho appealed for party unity in his Friday
speech at the convention.
</P>
<P>
"We need unity to win the upcoming elections and to prevent the
ruling camp from seeking to revise the Constitution in favor of a
parliamentary government system," he said at the GNP congress.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Expedition Begins Hike Through World's Largest Canyon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 10 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese expedition left Lhasa,
the capital of the Tibet Autonomous Region today to begin a trek
through the world's largest canyon, in the southeastern part of
the region.
</P>
<P>
The Yarlung Zangbo River Canyon is located on the Qinghai-Tibet
Plateau, the world's highest plateau, and is 496 kilometers long
and more than 5,000 meters deep.
</P>
<P>
Gao Dengyi, a physicist and head of the group, says that hiking
the canyon will be one of the major expeditions of this century,
and will provide a scientific basis for protecting and developing
the canyon.
</P>
<P>
He said that no one has ever succeeded in hiking through the
100-kilometer central part because of the difficult terrain and
the trekkers will do geological, biological, and other studies to
obtain first-hand materials on the natural ecology and resources
there.
</P>
<P>
The scientists will also improve on the accuracy of data on
length and depth of the canyon by using more sophisticated
equipment, but that still won't alter the fact that the canyon is
the largest in the world, Gao points out.
</P>
<P>
The canyon forms a horseshoe through the Himalayas and the
river's water could mean a lot to the development of water
resources in China in the next century, according to a hydrologist
who is a team member.
</P>
<P>
Scientists will also look at 0river transportation possibilities
for the canyon's Medog County, the only one in China without
roads. They have suggested that nature reserves and a national
park be built in the canyon.
</P>
<P>
The 20-member team will explore the canyon for more than 20
days in preparation for a larger-scale expedition in
October.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Machine Tools Becoming More Competitive On World Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 10 (Xinhua) -- China's machine tool industry has
increased its competitiveness by redesigning products, and
digitally-controlled machine tools greatly outnumbered ordinary
machine tools at an international machine tool exhibition that
closed here today.
</P>
<P>
A Department of Machinery Industry official says that the
exhibition attracted more than 500 manufacturers from across the
country and reflects the rapid growth in digitally-controlled
machine tools.
</P>
<P>
Michael Nicholson, of Bridgeport Machines Ltd. of Britain who
has attended the annual show several times, said that he can see
the speed of technological development in China's machine tool
industry. The combination of price and quality makes them
preferable for local enterprises to imported ones.
</P>
<P>
The price of good imported machine tools is considerably higher
than that of locally made ones, he said, and some Chinese
manufacturers can now compete with international companies.
</P>
<P>
The Yandangshan Machine Tool Industry Corp. of Zhejiang
Province has been invited to set up joint ventures with a number
of foreign companies. Its products are already sold in Europe, the
Americas, and Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
China exported 8.75 billion US dollars worth of machinery and
electronics goods in the first two months of this year, an

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Pak Furthers Its Financial Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government has
embarked on the process of much-talked financial reform by taking
a number of important measures to improve the financial
environment and steer competitions in the banking sector.
</P>
<P>
As one of the most important part of the financial reform
process, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has decided to introduce
a new mechanism for determining the limit within which banks can
make foreign currency transactions on day by day basis.
</P>
<P>
The proposed mechanism, which is in line with international
standard, will be effective from September this year and will help
boost foreign exchange business of the banks with large capital
bases.
</P>
<P>
The SBP has decided this week to link net open position (NOP)
of banks to their respective capital base. The Central Bank has
formally informed all the banks that their NOP will be fixed at 10
percent of their capital base.
</P>
<P>
The open position or NOP indicates the extent to which a bank
can go long or short in its foreign exchange transaction vis-a-vis
its volume of foreign exchange business.
</P>
<P>
The higher the NOP the more a bank can buy or sell foreign
currencies at a particular time.
</P>
<P>
NOP of a bank in Pakistan now is one-fifth of its nostro limit
which is linked with its volume of foreign exchange transactions
covering import, export and remittances.
</P>
<P>
Nostro limit indicates overall limits for foreign currency
transactions whereas net open position shows how much foreign
currency a bank can buy or sell at a time.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the banking sector said that there are many banks
in Pakistan whose capital bases are narrow but their volumes of
foreign exchange business are huge. Therefore, their NOP will be
cut.
</P>
<P>
One the other hand, NOP will increased for those banks which
have large capital bases but their volumes of foreign exchange
business are small.

<TEXT>
<P>
It is believed that the linking of NOP with capital bases of
the banks will make foreign currency transaction more transparent
and minimize currency speculations and over-trading of foreign
currency for profit taking.
</P>
<P>
The SBP's decision to link the NOP with the capital base is
part of a wide-ranging foreign exchange reforms that the SBP is
undertaking in phases.
</P>
<P>
Another important part of these reforms is that the banks have
been allowed to fix their own exchange rates for current account
operations.
</P>
<P>
From February 6 this year all banks were allowed to fix their
own exchange rates for all currencies except the U.S. dollar. And
from March 24, the banks were also allowed to quote their own
exchange rates for the dollar within a given band.
</P>
<P>
The SBP decided on March 17 to allow the banks fix their own
exchange rates and at the same time to widen the buy-sell spread
for the dollar to one percent from half a percent.
</P>
<P>
It is believed to be a liberalization step by the SBP moving
towards the ultimate goal of having market determined rates for
foreign currencies in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
However, economists here are of the view that to let the
Pakistani rupee float ultimately, a back-up credit line of four to
five billion dollars from the International Monetary Fund is
required to counter any speculators.
</P>
<P>
And before this is provided, Pakistan's fiscal deficit has to
be kept below the anticipated four percent in real terms. This
seems to be a hard nut to crack for the government.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here noted that since a long time Pakistan's
controlled exchange rate environment has kept many foreign
investors away.
</P>
<P>
With a wider dollar band the money market is likely to achieve
the depth and the efficiency levels to attract the much-needed
foreign investment for the economic development.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the linking of NOP to the capital bases will
create more competition towards capital formation in banking
sector.
</P>
<P>
This will lead to generation of long-term funds, both local as
well as foreign thereby boosting foreign exchange reserves of the
country on the one hand and resolving liquidity problems of banks
and other sections of economy on the other.

<P>
SHANGHAI, April 10 (Xinhua) -- An international flower festival
opened here today with nearly 10,000 types of flowers on display,
some of them rare, and more than 150 companies from 15 countries
and regions participating.
</P>
<P>
Thanks in large part to its economic growth and improved
standard of living, Shanghai is now home to the biggest flower
market in China.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, some 300 million stems of cut flowers and 15 million
pots of flowers were sold there, with fresh and cut flower sales
accounting for a quarter of China's total.
</P>
<P>
Sources in the city say it will hold international flower
festivals every year to help make people more aware of flowers and
to increase cultivation, marketing, and contacts and cooperation
with the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
The festival, which is Shanghai's first, will last 16 days.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Industrial Growth Slows Down In First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 10 (Xinhua) -- China's industrial sector
reported 442.1 billion yuan in added value during the first
quarter of this year, up 8.2 percent from the same period in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The increase is, however, 2.8 percentage points lower than for
the same period of 1997, according to the State Statistics Bureau.
</P>
<P>
In the January-February period, state-owned industrial
enterprises produced 261.5 billion yuan worth of added value, up
3.3 percent. The added value of collectively-owned sector was
108.4 billion yuan, and that of overseas-funded enterprises,
stocking-holding and other companies, 123.1 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Heavy and light industries had increases of 6.6 percent and 10
percent, respectively, in added value. The ratio of sales to
industrial output is estimated to be 93.78 percent, down 0.7
percentage point from the same period in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The SSB says that the slowdown was mainly caused by a decrease
in exports and investment in fixed assets over the past three
months. In the first quarter, industrial exports grew 7.7 percent
on an annual basis, but the increase is 11.4 percentage points
lower than for the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Although investment in fixed assets were up 10.2 percent on an
annual basis, the increase was down 7.9 percentage points from the
January-March period of 1997, as enterprise restructuring and
limiting production scale to reduce inventories hinder industrial
growth.
</P>
<P>
The SSB expects a rebound in industrial growth later this year,
as the central government's policies to stimulate demand take
effect.

MACAO, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Macao constructed and renovated a
total of 108 buildings in 1997, down 58 from 1996, latest
statistics show.
</P>
<P>
Official figures released by the Macao Census and Statistics
Department on Friday show that 64.8 percent of the newly-finished
buildings were residential houses, with the remaining for office,
business and other purposes. There was no building for industrial
use.

In addition, a total of 14,304 housing units were traded in
1997, of which 9,514 were new units. The transactions increased
24.9 percent from the figure in 1996, while the value involved
grew 3.9 percent to have reached 7.511 billion patacas (938.88
million U.S. dollars).
</P>

<HEADLINE> Macao Suffers From Japanese Economic Recession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The economic recession in Japan has
affected Macao's manufacturing, export and tourism businesses,
local economists said.
</P>
<P>
Many Macao garment manufacturers and exporters have complained
the garment export orders from Japan have plunged 30 to 40 percent
so far this year, adding that they expect further drops in the
future.
</P>
<P>
About 80 percent of Macao's exports are garments and textile
goods, heading mainly for the quota-market of the United States
and the European Union. But Japan remains Macao's largest
non-quota market.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the number of Japanese tourists to Macao has
already declined over the past several months. Japanese tourists
also spent less in Macao.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that Japanese tourists spent only 1,080.1
patacas (135 U.S. dollars) per person in the last quarter of
1997, down 26.9 percent from the same period the year before.
</P>
<P>
Some Macao travel agencies said they usually received between
700 to 800 Japanese passengers a day, but the figure has dropped
to only a dozen now.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN-CCI Agree to Accelerate Intra-ASEAN Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The 13th ASEAN Chamber of
Commerce and Industry (ASEAN-CCI) Conference and the 55th
ASEAN-CCI Council meeting closed here Friday, agreeing to
accelerate intra-ASEAN trade and cross-border business.
</P>
<P>
According to a joint communique issued at the one-day
conference, to accelerate intra-ASEAN trade and investment, the
chamber made proposals to governments, including mutual
recognition arrangement concerning regulations, standards and
technical requirements; mutual recognition arrangement concerning
the participation in the construction of infrastructure projects
and preference for the use of ASEAN capital goods.
</P>
<P>
The joint communique said "The ASEAN-CCI expresses its optimism
and confidence that the economies of ASEAN are in the process of
recovering from the current economic crisis since the appropriate
structural reforms were put in place."
</P>
<P>
The chamber believes that the crisis has also brought into
focus the economic implications of a more open and global economy
fueled by fast shifting of funds in and out of an economy, thus
creating more volatility in exchange rates and the capital
markets, the communique said, adding "The key concern to the
business community is the need to sustain stability of the
financial markets so that businesses can be conducted in a much
more predicable environment."
</P>
<P>
The chamber thus supports the initiatives taken by the ASEAN
governments towards stabilizing the financial markets and to
reduce contagion effect through the following measures:
</P>
<P>
-- The establishment of the ASEAN Surveillance mechanism,
</P>
<P>
-- The use of ASEAN currencies for intra-ASEAN trade
settlements,
</P>
<P>
-- The development of an ASEAN bond market, and
</P>
<P>
-- The establishment of multilateral trade financing
arrangement.
</P>
<P>
The chamber also strongly advocates for the development of a
more comprehensive venture capital market to increase the
availability of equity financing for intra-ASEAN investments, it
said.
</P>
<P>
To help the affected economies in ASEAN to recover, the chamber
strongly urges all enterprises to conduct and manage their
businesses in a manner to complement and reinforce the measures
taken or to be taken by the governments.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN-CCI signed the cooperation agreement with the Russian
Chamber of Commerce and Industry for the establishment of the
ASEAN-Russian Business Council.
</P>
<P>
At the 13th ASEAN-CCI conference, President of Malaysia's
National Chamber of Commerce and Industry Tajuddin Ramli assumed
the presidency of ASEAN-CCI, replacing Aburical Bakrie from
Indonesia.

<HEADLINE> Northern Ireland Peace Deal Imminent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The announcement of a historic
Northern Ireland peace deal is believed to be imminent, local
media reported Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
The parties at the peace talks at Stormont, Belfast, were still
discussing a settlement, but most of the political leaders were
confident of a deal to be reached in hours.
</P>
<P>
"All in all, when you put it together, it is genuinely a new
beginning for Northern Ireland," said British Prime Minister Tony
Blair's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Irish Foreign Minister David Andrews said the prospects for a
deal were "very, very positive."
</P>
<P>
"We are at this moment making history and we hope to complete
that task by 12 noon or 1 pm," BBC news quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
Despite intensive talks attended by Prime Minister Blair and
his Irish counterpart Bertie Ahern, the Thursday midnight deadline
passed without reaching an agreement by the eight political
parties in the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Matters still under discussion were said to include the
electoral system of a new devolved assembly, policing and the
release of paramilitary prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Unionist leader David Ervine said he believed a peace deal for
Northern Ireland had almost been thrashed out.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein chairman Mitchel Mclaughlin also indicated that
agreement had been reached on the main issue although some issues
remained to be agreed.

<HEADLINE> Buddhists Help Develop Sino-Nepalese Ties: Nepali PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Prime Minister Surya
Bahadur Thapa said here Friday morning that the Buddhist circles
have played an important role in developing friendly Sino-Nepalese
relations.
</P>
<P>
While meeting with a visiting Chinese Buddhist delegation,
Thapa noted that the Zhonghua Monastery being under construction
in Lumbini, the birthplace of Lord Buddha, bears testimony to the
friendly ties existing between the religious circles of the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that the current visit by the Chinese Buddhist
delegation adds a new page to the contacts and exchanges between
the Buddhist circles of the two countries, and it is sure to
further strengthen the friendly ties between them.
</P>
<P>
The nine-member Chinese Buddhist delegation arrived in Nepal
Wednesday for an eight-day visit at the invitation of the
non-governmental Dharmodaya Sabha of Nepal, or Nepal Buddhist
Association for Developing Buddhism.
</P>
<P>
Xin Cheng, leader of the Chinese delegation, noted that for the
last several decades, contacts and friendly exchanges between the
Buddhist circles of China and Nepal have never ceased.
</P>
<P>
The contacts and exchanges have further developed not only the
traditional friendship between the Buddhist circles of the two
countries, but also the traditional friendship between the peoples
of the two countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government, the people and the Buddhist circle
of China appreciate Nepal's consistent policy of friendliness
toward China, and it is deeply felt among the Buddhist circle of
China that friendly good-neighborliness between the two
governments and peoples have created favorable conditions for
exchanges between the Buddhist circles of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese delegation called on the Dharmodaya Sabha on
Thursday and will pay a visit to Lumbini in southern Nepal.

<P>
TIANJIN, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Tianjin, a major port city in
north China, has fired some 663 incompetent officials.
</P>
<P>
The officials previously worked for the city's state-owned
enterprises, according to local sources.
</P>
<P>
The Workers Representatives Congress has played and continues
to play an important role in making decisions concerning the
promotion and dismissal of employees.
</P>
<P>
For example, in 1997, the congress fully supported the
decision of a local textile company to fire 12 incompetent
officials. The company then hired a number of competent officials
and has not only won the trust of its employees, but has also
turned losses into profits.
</P>
<P>
Assessments completed by workers made us realize that they are
indeed the masters of the enterprise and their comments greatly
enhanced our sense of responsibility, according to the director of
a public utilities plant.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that more than 10,000 officials work for the
city's 3,000-odd enterprises. The congress provides supervision
and evaluates the competency of all officials on an annual basis.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Private Airline Begins Flight to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 10 (Xinhua) -- While the reciprocal air ban
between Nigeria and Britain remains to be lifted, a Nigerian
private airline Bellview is to begin flight to Amsterdam, the
Netherlands Friday.
</P>
<P>
Under the joint commercial operation with the national carrier
Nigeria Airways, Bellview's Airbus will take off every Tuesday
and Friday on the route, which has become more lucrative since
Nigeria and Britain suspended the airlink in February last year.
</P>
<P>
As part of the take-off bonanza, Bellview is offering would-be
customers a special return fare of 61,000 Naira (about 740 U.S.
Dollars) to Amsterdam, London, Paris, Brussels and Rome through
interlining deals.
</P>
<P>
In a release issued by Bellview press relations officer Ngozi
Elechi Thursday, the airline assured that adequate interlining
arrangements have been made to fly passengers to other cities in
Europe as soon as they arrive in Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
While also assuring passengers of first class facilities,
Bellview promised "not to let them down in this privileged
venture."
</P>
<P>
"We wish to reiterate our total dedication to premium customer
service reliability and safety," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
Bellview's rising profiles as a reliable local operator earned
it a business romance which culminated in a cooperation agreement
with the national carrier to service the routes to Bombay,
Nairobi and Brazil.

<HEADLINE> Smokers Unwelcome to Mt. Kilimanjaro  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Smokers who are prone to
cause forest fires may be prohibited to climb Kilimanjaro, the
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The ban, according to the Kilimanjaro National Park (KINAPA),
is to reduce fire outbreaks in the mountain, which on average
destroy 3,600 hectares of forests every year.
</P>
<P>
KINAPA's Chief Park Warden Lorivi Ole Moirana said smoking
accounted for five percent of the mountain fires, and the ban may
help to cut down possibilities of fires, the paper reported.
</P>
<P>
Moirana, however, did not say when the smoking ban will be
imposed. "We're working out few technicalities and we'll soon
make the announcement," he said.
</P>
<P>
Fires destroyed about 15,000 hectares in the mountain last
year, causing environmental destruction and heavy pollution.
</P>
<P>
According to a research conducted by KINAPA, 31 percent of
the fires in the mountain were caused by illegal hunters, 18
percent were caused by honey gatherers, 13 percent by timber
loggers, 10 percent by porters, and 2.5 percent by farming
activities. Other fires were caused by burning to encourage fresh
growth of grass, land conflicts#,charcoal burning and bhang
cultivation.
</P>
<P>
Moirana also said Mt. Kilimanjaro, as high as 5,895 meters,
is expected to attract more tourists this year. Last year 13,000
tourists visited the mountain, thanks to a massive publicity
campaign launched by Tanzania in Europe.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Prime Minister Thapa Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thapa reportedly had agreed to give up the premiership for the
NC
after he survived a no-confidence motion in February at a special
session of parliament.
</P>
<P>
But in March, he said he still believed in snap polls. Then he
said he would resign only after the visit of Indian President K.R.
Narayanan.
</P>
<P>
The Indian president had planned to visit Nepal on April 7-
10, but
in late March put off his visit till the end of May citing health
reasons.
</P>
<P>
As several rounds of talks failed and Prime Minister Thapa
clung to power, impatience grew in the NC. The NC had threatened
to withdraw support if Thapa does not resign as quick as possible.
</P>
<P>
The NC, now the biggest party in parliament after the split of
the major opposition Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxism
-Leninism, CPN-UML), hankers after the leadership of the
government bearing in mind the general elections due for later
next year, observers said.
</P>
<P>
The Nepal Sadbhavana Party has said it might withdraw from
the government if Thapa steps down before completing his
nine-month term agreed upon, and the Nepal Peasants' and Workers'
Party with two MPs has clearly stated that it will not support a
government headed by the NC.
</P>
<P>
The NC is now seeking alliance with other political parties ,
in particular the Communist Party of Nepal (Marxism-Leninism, C
PN-ML), the breakaway faction of the CPN-UML, sources said.
</P>
<P>
If everything goes smoothly, Girija Prasad Koirala, president
and parliamentary leader of the NC, is expected to head the fifth
coalition government in Nepal since the mid-term polls in November
1994.

<HEADLINE> Forest Fires In Indonesia Bring Rare Animals on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Fires which have been raging out
of control in some areas in the Indonesian Province of East
Kalimantan have destroyed the habitat of several rare species of
animals, bringing them on the brink of extinction, a forest
officer said.
</P>
<P>
Even with the blaze, many people do not hesitate to catch such
rare animals as deer and porcupines at the Bukit Soeharto forest
park, Ahmad Rijadi said on Thursday in Samarinda, capital of East
Kalimantan province, reports reaching here Friday said.
</P>
<P>
Some 180,280 hectares of forests in East Kalimantan have been
devastated by fires from January 1 to April 2, an official of the
provincial Environmental Impact Control Agency said.
</P>
<P>
The fires had caused estimated losses of 365.4 million U.S.
dollars, excluding losses related to the environment, health and
ecological change.
</P>
<P>
Several rare animals have fled their habitat to safer grounds
to escape the fires, Rijadi said.
</P>
<P>
Local residents could easily catch deer, reports said.
</P>
<P>
They have also frequently caught orangutans which fled the
Dutai National park, home to nearly 2,000 orangutans, said the
reports.
</P>
<P>
East Kalimantan has been gripped by a scorching drought since
the middle of last year, creating ideal conditions for the spread
of fires.
</P>
<P>
The fires in the province have sent thick smoke over the
region, making thousands people ill and leading to shortages of
food and water in some areas.
</P>
<P>
Last year, at least 300,000 hectares of forests were ravaged by
fires in Sumatra and Kalimantan islands in Indonesia, causing a
loss of more than 3 billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Kiriyenko not to Persuade or Pressure for Premiership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Russian acting Prime Minister
Sergei Kiriyenko told the State Duma (lower house of the
parliament) on Friday that he will not try to persuade anyone to
approve his nomination as the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he would ask President Boris Yeltsin to
re-nominate him again after he fails to pass the first Duma
ballot, Kiriyenko said, "I will not try to persuade anyone, nor
will I pressure anyone."
</P>
<P>
He said that Russia needs a government which will win national
trust with its policy or its actions.
</P>
<P>
Kiriyenko added that the new cabinet will need public support
in taking the country out of its crisis and the "openness and
transparence of government" is the only way to ensure such support.
</P>
<P>
The next government's creed will be "It is not people that
exist for the economy but the economy that exists for people",
said Kiriyenko.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Kiriyenko also called on Duma to further
cooperate with the government in law-making. He said the practice
of trilateral commissions on such projects as the tax code and the
1998 budget proved effective and must be continued.
</P>
<P>
He favored a change in budget subsidies, a growth of incomes
and a lesser tax burden on low-income people.
</P>
<P>
The acting premier expressed support for privatization, saying
that "I see nothing unacceptable in privatization" and each
institution should be privatized in its own way.
</P>
<P>
Kiriyenko was nominated by Yeltsin as prime minister after he
dismissed the entire cabinet on March 23. The State Duma is to
vote on the nomination on Friday afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Mozambican President Hails Debt Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano has hailed the announcement of a debt relief package
by the World Bank and the International
Monetary Fund (IMF), saying "It would envigorize Mozambican
economy."
</P>
<P>
He made the statement here Thursday after having a video
conference with James Wolfenson, head of the World Bank, local
newspaper Noticias reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank and IMF Tuesday decided to include Mozambique
in the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative and
reduce its over 5-billion-Dollar debt to about 1.4 billion by
June 1999.
</P>
<P>
The debt relief to Mozambique, which is due to its "good
governance", and "well-operated economy," said Wolfenson, has
surpassed any relief to other five HIPC, namely Uganda, Guyana,
Bolivia, Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Chissano still expressed the hope that all the
debt be relieved.
</P>
<P>
"That will be a significant help, because more capital will be
used for health, education and other fields," he said.

LOS ANGELES, April 9 (Xinhua) -- A coalition of California
universities and high-tech companies will soon finish constructing
a super-high-speed computer network that will carry data more than
100 times faster than today's Internet.
</P>
<P>
The 15-million-dollar network, called the California Research
and Education Network or CalREN-2, will be ready to work in
June. A collection of 135 colleges and businesses, it will connect
all its members by the end of the year and serve as a virtual
university for students and professors.
</P>
<P>
CalREN-2 will transmit data at speeds up to 2.4 gigabits per
second, fast enough to download a 30-volume encyclopedia in less
than two seconds. It will also employ experimental protocols that
will use network resources more efficiently.
</P>
<P>
The new network will keep California at the forefront of
technology and will allow universities to perform online research
that is not possible over the Internet today, educational and
government researchers said.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 10 (Xinhua) -- One Kuwaiti national was
killed in a fatal stampede that took place Thursday, the final day
of the annual hajj in Mina near the Saudi holy city of Mecca,
Kuwaiti Health Minister Adel Al-Sabah said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The minister said in a statement that the Kuwaiti national aged
45 was performing the annual religious services with his wife and
other Kuwaiti pilgrims.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi television has updated the death toll of the tragic
accident from previously reported 107 to 118, including 11 who
died in hospital.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued Thursday by the Hajj Security Command said
the accident occurred after mid-day at a bridge in Mina, 10
kilometers from Mecca, where hundred of thousands of pilgrims
sought to perform the ritual of symbolic storing of the devil for
the last time before ending the services.
</P>
<P>
It said that a large number of pilgrims rushed to the stoning
site, jamming the bridge leading to it and causing the deadly
stampede. Most of the victims were sick and elderly people.
</P>
<P>
The bridge had been widened from 40 meters to 80 meters in 1994
to accommodate more people after 270 pilgrims were stamped to
death in another accident.
</P>
<P>
Some 2 million Muslims from around the world converge in the
Saudi holy sites of Mecca and Medina every year to perform hajj
rituals which a Muslim should try to observe at least once in a
lifetime.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of kuwaitis went to Saudi Arabia to perform
hajj this year.

<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Production problems with its
new Boeing-737 models will cost the aircraft maker Boeing Co. 350
million dollars in the first quarter, the company said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Changes will have to be made to its new models under the
requirement of European regulators, including the installment of
new emergency exits, the company said.
</P>
<P>
About 28 jets of the new model had been assembled when the
Joint Aviation Authorities ordered the changes for European
certification. The company was forced to make costly design
changes and retrofit planes, including some that had been
delivered for use on domestic U.S. routes.
</P>
<P>
Problems with its new Boeing-737 models had reportedly caused a
696-million-dollar loss for Boeing Co. in the third quarter last
year and was expected to cost the company 2.6 billion dollars in
1998.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the company posted a 178-million-dollar loss
in 1997, its first annual loss in 50 years.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Calls for Immediate Approval of Kiriyenko's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
Friday urged the State Duma (lower house of the parliament) to
approve his nomination of Sergei Kiriyenko as the premier as soon
as possible, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
In his regular radio address, Yeltsin said he has no any other
candidate but Kiriyenko for the post.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the State Duma deputies will hold a secret ballot on
Kiriyenko's nomination, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Refuting the allegation that the 35-year-old nominee is
inexperienced, Yeltsin said Kiriyenko is a "professional manager
with strong team skills, who avoids self-advertising and cheap
populism."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the economic situation in the country is
becoming critical and the people are living without the government
for an untolerably long time. "Too much time is being spent on
consultations and talks," Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
However, another press report quoted first vice-speaker of the
State Duma Vladimir Ryzhkov as saying that Kiriyenko is unlikely
to get support from the lower house in the first ballot.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Huang Yingda, an official with
the Ministry of Science and Technology, today proposed that a
high-tech industrial zone be built in the area between the
Shenzhen Special Economic Zone and the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR).
</P>
<P>
Huang, deputy director of the ministry's policy, law and system
reform department, tabled the suggestion during a morning meeting
with a delegation of scientific and technological scholars from Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the zone should not only play a role in
the Pearl River Delta where Shenzhen is, but also serve
as a window for high-tech cooperation between the HKSAR and inland
China, as well as an "incubator" for high-tech businesses.
</P>
<P>
The visiting delegation consists of representatives from major
institutions and institutes in Hong Kong and is headed by
Professor Ching-Fai Ng. The delegation is visiting China at the
invitation of the Ministry of Science and Technology.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing and Minister of Science and
Technology Zhu Lilan held discussions with the delegation on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Members of the delegation agreed that the livelihood
and prosperity of the people of Hong Kong are directly related to
the development of high-technology.
</P>
<P>
They also pointed to the urgency of using high technology to
upgrade Hong Kong's industrial sector to counter the affects
arising from the ongoing financial crisis in Southeast Asia.

<HEADLINE> China Plans to Auction off Imperial Robes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 10 (Xinhua) -- China will auction off some
yellow robes with a dragon design used only by emperors, on April
18.
</P>
<P>
Items put up for bidding will include imperial robes, court
dress, and jewelry worn by the Daoguang Emperor of the Qing
Dynasty (1644-1911) and six of his sons, which were used in the
epic movie "Opium War".
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the Shanghai International Auction Corp., which
is conducting the auction, says that the most attractive items are
the emperor's summer clothing that is embroidered with dragons,
which took a dozen craftsmen half a year to make, along with a
crown, a belt, and a pair of boots decorated with pearls, which
are valued at 150,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Regulations from the Zhou Dynasty (1100-221 B.C.) stated that
yellow robes with dragons could be used by emperors only, and if
others wore them it carried the death penalty, according to
historians who assist in the film production.
</P>

with China in the 1840s.

<HEADLINE> Finance Minister Outlines Financial Reform Priorities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Finance Minister Xiang Huaicheng
said here today that the impetus of China's financial reform will
focus on replacing dues collections with tax payments.
</P>
<P>
The imposition of various fees by different departments has
imposed a heavy burden on the general public and enterprises, and
has in turn aroused wide-spread discontent, according to Xiang.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, changing the focus to tax payments simply represents
a continuation of financial reform, said Xiang, adding that the
central government is currently drafting a comprehensive
implementation plan.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that doing a good job in the financial field
faces grave challenges resulting from prevailing conditions under
the socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Xiang noted the existence of many problems and
contradictions related to the financial sector, but nonetheless
expressed confidence that the government will continue to reduce
annual deficits.

<HEADLINE> Israel Improves Tactics Against Hezbollah </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Israeli army occupying south
Lebanon has improved tactics which proved to be effective in
combating Hezbollah guerrillas and led to a corresponding
reduction in casualties.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese newspaper Daily Star said Friday that since last
November, the Israelis have improved the defense capabilities of
their compounds in the self-styled security zone and are now in a
better position to withstand attacks by Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the paper quoted Israeli Deputy Chief of Staff Maj
Gen Shaul Mofaz as telling Israeli Knesset (parliament) Foreign
Affairs and Defense Committee last Tuesday that Lebanese
guerrillas have returned to long-range mortar and rocket strikes
rather than close-quarter operations.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, is waging a
guerrilla war against an estimated 2,000-strong Israeli troops,
trying to dislodge them from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a 1,200-square-kilometer area in south
Lebanon, allegedly to buffer Lebanese guerrilla cross-border
attacks against its northern residents.
</P>
<P>
Although Hezbollah staged record numbers of operations in the
last two months, they have not been paralleled by Israeli
fatalities, with only four soldiers killed compared to 15
Hezbollah casualties.
</P>
<P>
These figures are in marked contrast to the period between
August and October last year when the guerrillas killed 25
Israeli soldiers for the loss of 17 militants.
</P>
<P>
The paper said Israeli troops have a healthy respect for
Hezbollah's proficiency at dropping mortar rounds directly into
their positions.
</P>
<P>
Guerrillas are reportedly spending most of their time
sheltering in underground bunkers in anticipation of any sudden
attacks.
</P>
<P>
In this case, the paper added, regular Israeli troops are
conducting fewer patrols in "hot" areas of its occupied zone,
relying increasingly on commando units to lay ambushes against
the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Improved marksmanship and new assault weapons equipped with
advanced night-vision sights also provide them added protection.
</P>
<P>
But, observers said, despite Israeli innovations Hezbollah is
constantly evolving militarily to meet Israeli tactical advances
and has the capability and will to inflict greater casualties on
the Israeli occupying forces.

<HEADLINE> Tomba Still Undecided over Retirement: Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Italian skiing star Alberto Tomba
has yet to decide whether to retire from alpine skiing
competitions at the age of 31, a newspaper here reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"I will reach a conclusion after considering the question for
several weeks," Tomba was quoted as saying here by the Japanese
sports daily Nikkan Sports.
</P>
<P>
Tomba, who won the season's last slalom race in Switzerland in
March, said it would be easy for him to decide on retiring if he
had lost the race.
</P>
<P>
"But because I won I am not yet able to reach a conclusion,"
said Tomba, who was visiting Japan to ski in an exhibition race
with former Olympic and World Cup stars.
</P>
<P>
Tomba has won three Olympic gold medals but failed to grab one
at the Nagano Games in February.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Company Says It Will Work With Chinese to Improve Competition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The U.S.'s Boston Consulting
Group (BCG) is willing to work with Chinese state-owned enterprises and
multinationals to improve competitiveness, its president and CEO,
Carl W. Stern, told a recent meeting of its Global Executive
Committee in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The group started doing business in China in the early 1980s
and developed a joint venture, Shanghai-Boston Consulting Co. Ltd,
in cooperation with Shanghai Jiaotong University and the Bank of
Communications in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture has more than 20 professional consultants and
BCG has more than 40 from Hong Kong working there.
</P>
<P>
Previously, BCG's China business mainly involved helping large
multinationals better understand China and make wise investment
decisions, but it has gradually shifted focus to helping Chinese
enterprises do organizational reshuffling and improve their
competitiveness on the international market.
</P>
<P>
China's economy has been developing rapidly, especially in
Shanghai, and it has become a new area for BCG's expansion, Stern
said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesians Breaking into Embassies Asked to Be </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Foreign Minister
Abdullah Ahmad Badawi Friday confirmed that the Swiss and French
embassies and the Brunei High Commission had asked police to
remove the Indonesian immigrants who broke into their compounds
earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
The United States embassy, whose compound was also broken into,
has informed the Foreign Ministry of the matter but did not
mention any action to be taken against the immigrants, Abdullah
told reporters after signing an agreement between the Malaysian
government and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red
Crescent National Societies (IFRC) here.
</P>
<P>
U.S. embassy press officer James Warren said the embassy had
contacted the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR) here to handle the situation.
</P>
<P>
Police said eight Indonesian immigrants scaled a three-meter
wall to enter the U.S. embassy ground seeking political asylum,
another eight climbed over the gate of the French embassy, a dozen
entered the Swiss embassy and seven into the Istana Sharif Ali, a
palace belonging to the Brunei government.
</P>
<P>
The three missions and the palace are located close to each
other in the diplomatic enclave here.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian Immigrants claimed to be Acehnese, seeking
political asylum.
</P>
<P>
On whether the Indonesians were really political refugees as
claimed, Abdullah said the government could not determine at this
point in view of the large number of Indonesian immigrants in the
country.
</P>
<P>
"We know that they came in without permission or any document
so they are treated like illegal immigrants," he said, adding that
he did not see how the UNHCR could be involved in the matter.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said that as far as Malaysia was
concerned, the influx of Indonesian immigrants in Malaysia was due
to the economic slump in their homeland.
</P>
<P>
This is the factor that brought them here and they come from
all over Indonesia, he said.
</P>
<P>
On security of the embassies, the foreign minister said he
believed all the embassies here had their own security measures
and it was up to them to handle the matter.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Plans New Armed Forces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 10 (Xinhua) -- A new small-sized functional army will
soon be formed in Sierra Leone, President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah has
announced, said a report reaching here Friday.
</P>
<P>
In his first nationwide radio address Thursday since his
resintatement on March 10, President Kabbah said that the new security
force would comprise core professional soldiers, naval and air force
men, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Kabbah's reinstatement followed the mid-February fall of the
military junta which forced the president to flee to neighboring
Guinea in May last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the new armed forces would be equipped with state-of-art
weapons to provide foolproof security for the people, the president
said, without giving the size of the planned army.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the former armed forces of the country
before the coup had about 10,000 men. The Revolutionary United Front
(RUF) rebel group, which has been fighting successive governments
since early 1990s and allied with the junta shortly after the coup,
has about 15,000 rebel fighters.
</P>
<P>
Kabbah neither disclosed whether the west African peacekeeping
force (ECOMOG), which drove the junta forces and RUF rebels out of the
capital, would assist in the formation of the new army.
</P>
<P>
The president announced that former soldiers who joined the
Nigerian-led ECOMOG forces to flush out the junta would be integrated
into the new military outfit.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria had signed with Kabbah a military pact before the coup to
help train Sierra Leonean soldiers and provide limited security in the
country.
</P>
<P>
While praising the hunter militia known as Kamajors for their
fighting alongside ECOMOG against the junta regime, he also announced
that foreigners who collaborated with the ousted junta would be
deported and all law abiding foreigners would be given freedom to
pursue their legitimate businesses in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the remnants of the junta forces and RUF rebels are
still holding out in the eastern part of the country and have
reportedly been killing civilians in the areas under their control,
along with looting, raping and other destruction activities.
</P>
<P>
Kabbah warned soldiers still loyal to the hiding junta leader
Johnny Paul Koroma to surrender to ECOMOG, but diplomats noted that
without any promise of amnesty, it would be difficult to convince
these soldiers to surrender.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, April 10 (Xinhua) -- A group of scientists recently
uncovered the bones of a 130-million-year-old animal in Shenyang,
the capital of China's Liaoning province.
</P>
<P>
The remains were identified as those of a mammal from the most
primitive age of development.
</P>
<P>
The 13-centimeter skeleton is similar to that of a mouse and
some features of a duckbill or a marsupial, and its tooth
structure is quite similar to today's animals, scientists from
the Academy of Sciences say.
</P>
<P>
They explained that mammals began to increase in number some 65
million years ago and before that were quite rare at a time when
the earth was dominated by dinosaurs.

<HEADLINE> Five Sent off in Libertadores Cup Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Five players were sent off
the field in a Libertadores Cup tie between Brazil's Vasco da Gama
and Mexico's America on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The kicking game was a senseless affair as both teams had
already qualified for the second round before play began, making
the first round group two game effectively a friendly.
</P>
<P>
Mexican international Alberto Garcia Aspe gave the Mexican
club a sixth-minute lead from the penalty spot, only to become
the first player to be shown the red card in the 40th minute.
</P>
<P>
If Ecuadorean referee Byron Moreno had stuck to the letter
of the law, he would have used his red card even more.
</P>
<P>
Vasco da Gama defender Odvan, who was sent off three times
in the second half of last year, continued his appalling
disciplinary record when he was dismissed almost immediately
after Aspe.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Task Force Set up in Kenya to Reform Health </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has set up
a task force to reform the health sector by reviewing rules and
regulations governing the sector, the East African Standard
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said the initiative is expected to come up with
recommendations to shift policies and remove the mandate of
providing direct health services from the Health Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will be expected in the future to direct
strategic planning, policy formulation, regulation and resource
mobilization, said the report.
</P>
<P>
During the launching of the task force on Thursday, Kenyan
Attorney-General Amos Wako said there was need to review the role
of specific ministries and departments because the government's
duty was to provide an enabling environment for economic and
social activities.
</P>
<P>
In Kenya, there are 13 separate parliamentary acts governing
the health sector which are outdated and need revision, and some
of them dated back to 1921.
</P>
<P>
The task force to review health related acts will be headed by
the Director of Medical Services James Mwanzia and comprise
experts from the Health Ministry, Medical Practitioners and
Dentist Board, the legal fraternity and the Attorney General's
chambers.
</P>
<P>
Kenya has set up 10 task forces under the Law Reform
Commission and six of them have already presented their final
reports for approval, according to the Attorney General.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Mid-East And Africa Yearbook (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 10 (Xinhua) -- China Social Sciences Literature
Publishing House, which is known as "an advisor" of the Communist
Party Central Committee and the State Council, has published a
yearbook on the Mid-East and Africa, indicating its interest in
the regions and the situation there.
</P>
<P>
The "Development Report on the Mid-East and Africa" was
produced by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS), the
Foreign Affairs Ministry, the Foreign Economic and Trade
Cooperation Ministry, and the Chinese Communist Party Central
Committee's International Liaison Department.
</P>
<P>
The book's chief editor and director of CASS's West Asia and
Africa Institute, Zhao Guozhong, explains the reason for the book
by saying that the Mid-East and Africa have been major regions of
unrest and have remained complicated, unstable, and uncertain
areas after the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
The 300-page report analyses the situation there, the peace
process, changes in international relations, UN peace-keeping
efforts, and internal political affairs like elections in Iran and
civil wars in Zaire and the Congo.
</P>
<P>
It also discusses oil production in the Gulf Region and trade,
labor, and investment prospects, along with the Western powers'
strategies for seizing power there.
</P>
<P>
The political framework the U.S. created by taking advantage of
the end of the Cold War and the victory in the Gulf War can no
longer be maintained, it says, and China is playing a more active
role in safeguarding stability and peace in the regions. Zhao says
that after the 1991 Gulf War, scholars discussed the political and
economic situations in the Mid-East and Africa every year in
Beijing and have published reports on these talks.
</P>
<P>
The book also points to the significance of the development of
relations between China and South Africa last year.

<HEADLINE> Israeli's Trade Deficit Falls Sharply This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Israel's trade deficit dropped
22.9 percent in the first quarter of the year to 1.659 billion
dollars, local daily The Jerusalem Post reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics as
saying that during the quarter imports reached 6.93 billion
dollars, down 6.6 percent from the 7.42 billion dollars recorded
in the first quarter last year, while exports increased 0.1
percent from 5.267 to 5.27 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, exports to the Far East were down 25 percent on the
same period last year due to the financial crisis in the region
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The March trade deficit totaled 789.2 million dollars, down
some 10 percent from the 874.2 million dollars the previous year.
</P>
<P>
As far as East Asia is concerned, exports totaled 722.9
million dollars in the first quarter, as against 967.7 million
dollars in the comparable months in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The bulk of that slump is being felt in the diamond industry,
where exports slipped from 534.1 million dollars in the first
quarter last year to 361.2 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
During the first quarter exports were most significantly down
to Thailand, Singapore, and South Korea. Official trade was also
substantially down with Indonesia and Malaysia, but these count
for a tiny faction of Israel's exports to the Far East.

<HEADLINE> World Bank To Increase Support for China's Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank's Vice-president
for the East Asia and Pacific Region, Jean-Michel Severino, told a
press conference in Beijing today that the bank is prepared to
increase support for China's reforms.
</P>
<P>
He said that the bank is discussing with the Chinese side a
wide range of possibilities like pilot programs, seminars,
technical assistance, and training for state-owned enterprises,
and that the bank completely endorses and supports the reforms the
Chinese government has decided on.
</P>
<P>
On the macro-economic side, he said, the government's decision
to try to boost domestic demand is good, and the World Bank will
back China's infrastructure program.
</P>
<P>
On the structural side, the Chinese government has announced
its reforms in health, housing, budget, pensions, and grain
distribution, and the bank is already involved in these areas and
can increase its support for the government, he said, adding that
the bank will continue its support for China's education and
poverty alleviation.
</P>
<P>
This year, the bank will provide about 2.5 billion US dollars
worth of loans, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said, however, that there are three lessons to be learned
from the Southeast Asian financial crisis: China needs to keep a
very close eye on its competitive ability; it needs to be careful
about establishing a good government system and a sound
relationship between banks, companies, and the state; and it needs
to be cautious about opening up the economy, especially the
financial sector.
</P>
<P>
Severino said the bank is ready to assist the Chinese
government in infrastructure funds and bond financing linked to
World Bank projects to promote greater reliance on private savings
rather than on government revenues.
</P>
<P>
He said the bank is also prepared to assist the development of
China's legal framework conducive to attracting infrastructure
capital and its capital market, and to help develop more
comprehensive urban development projects in medium-sized and large
cities.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank has been cooperating with China for 20 years in
186 projects, involving a total of more than 28.6 billion US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
China was the bank's largest borrower from 1993 to 1997.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Ruling Party to Mobilize Youths against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's ruling Movement for
Multi-party Democracy (MMD) is going to mobilise youths in Lusaka
to counter threats of violence against the government, the
state-controlled Times of Zambia reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held here Thursday, Michael Bwalya,
Lusaka MMD youth chairman, called for the deployment of 4,000
youths to be on 24-hour alert to counter the threats of violence
from the United National Independence Party (UNIP), the former
ruling and now largest opposition party in the country.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, a UNIP senior cadre told a meeting in
Ndola, 300 kilometers north of Lusaka, that 1,000 youths will be
recruited to unseat the government and release detained Kenneth
Kaunda, former president and now UNIP leader, who has been
detained more than three months for alleged involvement in last
year's foiled coup.
</P>
<P>
"We are not going to take these utterances with kid gloves,
instead we are going to mobilize ourselves and meet them head on
no matter what it takes," said Bwalya.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to the MMD members in general and the party
security wing in particular to be alert and vigilant in the wake
of threats being issued by the UNIP.
</P>
<P>
He also suggested the recruitment of at least 4,000 youths in
Lusaka to stand by 24 hours a day to protect the lives and
property of innocent Zambians.
</P>
<P>
"This must be done so as to monitor the situation. The time
to fight back is now, " he stressed.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- A new national task force has

activities in the country, The New Vision reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Police spokesman Bob Ngobi told the paper Thursday that the
unit, dubbed the National Task Force Against Terrorism is a
quickly responding unit to demobilize and detonate bombs.
</P>
<P>
The force is formed five days after two terrorist attacks in
the downtown area of Kampala in which four people were killed.
</P>
<P>
Early reports said the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), a rebel
group operating in the west of the country, is behind the
terrorist actions. Five other surprise attacks in Kampala in the
past three weeks were also connected with the two raids last
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, a grenade was removed Thursday by
Ugandan army in Luzira, a suburb southeast of the capital
Kampala.

<P>
The National Security Council held a meeting Monday to discuss
security measures and worked out strategies to ensure security in
the country, the paper said in a report Friday.
</P>

From Thursday, the Ugandan police has launched lectures on
television and radio on how to cope with suspected terrorist
activities. These are awareness lectures for civilians, police
explained.

<HEADLINE> Seniors Told Not to Worry Too Much About Being Overweight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Seniors who are overweight
should not have too much worries since it is not a high risk of
dying as people had thought, according to a study by scientists at
the Seattle-based University of Washington (UW).
</P>
<P>
In the study of 4,317 non-smoking men and women averaging 73
years old, the researchers found that being overweight didn't
increase the risk of dying over the people's next five years.
</P>
<P>
"Older people should just relax about being overweight," the
Seattle Times quoted Paula Diehr, UW professor of biostatistics
and health services as saying. "It's not a tremendously high risk,
although they may not feel as well."
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the researchers found that seniors who
unintentionally had lost 10 percent or more of their weight since
the age of 50 had a higher risk of dying. Those men have a 30
percent risk of dying compared with 18 percent who had not lost
that much weight, and those women had a 16 percent risk compared
with 8 percent who had maintained their weight.
</P>
<P>
For healthy older people, the UW study said, "Obesity provides
a nutritional reserve to the individual in times of stress, such
as illness or trauma, and individuals with a higher weight are
more likely to survive acute illness."

JERUSALEM, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National

Agency for airing interviews with radical Islamic group Hamas
leaders, Israel Radio reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Palestinian police officer as saying that
the bureau was closed for distributing faulty news.
</P>
<P>
He said that the agency has carried interviews with Hamas
leaders, who accused PNA of wrongly arresting Hamas members and
murdering bombmaker Muhei Eddine Sharif.
</P>
<P>
The officer claimed that the agency had broken the law by
broadcasting a Hamas videotape on Wednesday, showing a masked man
blaming the PNA for involvement in Sharif's death.
</P>
<P>
He said Reuter's reporters in Gaza were questioned Thursday
night and signed forms promising not to contact the agency for
three months.
</P>
<P>
The bureau's closure came amid continued exchange of accusation
between PNA and Hamas regarding the death of Sharif, who was
killed in mysterious circumstances in the West Bank city of
Ramallah on March 29.
</P>
<P>
PNA announced that Sharif was murdered by his fellow Hamas
activists in an internal power struggle, while Hamas said Israel
was responsible for his assassination.
</P>
<P>
On the videotape broadcast by Reuters, Hamas first directed
blames on the PNA for "collaborating with Israel" in Sharif's
killing.

BEIJING, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The China Aviation Technology
Import-Export Corporation and the Canada Aerospace Group recently
signed a memorandum that calls for China to export 240 N-5A
aircraft to Canada over the next five years.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Calls for Foreign Help in Economic Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam needs continued help from
international organizations and foreign friends as it moves from a
subsidized economy to a market one, Vietnamese deputy prime
minister Nguyen Manh Cam said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Cam, also foreign minister, told Rubens Ricupero,
secretary-general of the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development (UNCTAD), that the country now lacks qualified human
resources and a legal system for its operation in international
organizations, the English daily Vietnam News said.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam, a member of the Asian Free Trade Association (AFTA)
for three years, will join the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
forum (APEC) and is keen to enter the World Trade Organisation
(WTO).
</P>
<P>
Cam said that Vietnam will work hard to integrate its economy
with the Asia-Pacific region and the world.
</P>
<P>
Ricupero, who arrived here Sunday for a week-long visit,
promised that UNCTAD will support Vietnam's efforts to enter the
WTO.
</P>
<P>
But he also reminded Vietnam that it will have to honor the
same commitments to the WTO as other countries do.
</P>
<P>
The UNCTAD secretary-general added that the practical lessons
of other developing countries now integrated with the world
economy might be useful for Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR Expects Greater Role in Refugee Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Officials of the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said here Friday that they had
not been informed of a decision by Thailand to allow them to help
solve the Karen refugee issue.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said Thailand would allow the UNHCR to play a
greater role in handling the Karen refugees on the Thai-Myanmar
border.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted Thai Supreme Commander General Mongkol
Ampornpisit as saying that "the UNHCR will work jointly with
Thailand in relocating the refugees to safer areas further inside
Thailand's borders."
</P>
<P>
He said the UNHCR would be allowed to work with the Thai
military to take better care of the refugees and ensure more
security and safety for the refugees.
</P>
<P>
Plans are reportedly underway to combine and relocate the camps
aimed at facilitating closer supervision and providing more
security and safety for the refugees.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR has been seeking greater access to the refugee camps
which shelter some 90,000 Karen refugees who escaped to Thailand
after being attacked by their rival Karen Buddhist army.

<HEADLINE> China's Stock Market Burgeoning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 10 (Xinhua) -- China's rapidly maturing stock
market has witnessed rapid growth in recent years, with market
capitalization reaching a record 1.878 trillion yuan by the end of
March.
</P>
<P>
The number of companies listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen
securities exchanges hit 763 by the end of March, up from 530 in
1996 and 745 in 1997. In addition, share capital on the markets
jumped to 187 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
As a result, securities markets are playing an increasing role
in the national economic development, with their share of
capitalization in the overall economy surging from less than eight
percent in 1995 to 14 percent in 1996, and even further to 23
percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The fact that large enterprises, including Shanghai Automobile,
Handan Steel and the Hongqiao Airport, have received priority
placement serves as a true indication of the strong support the
market is expected to give to the state enterprise reform drive.
</P>
<P>
Some 32 million people invested in the rapidly growing stock
market during 1997, up substantially from the 20 million in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Chinese economists attribute the rapid growth of the securities
market to the government's commitment to foster the capital market
and expand the role of direct financing. They also point out that
standardization of the securities market has continued to lead any
expansion in market size.

<HEADLINE> Thai Airways Orders New Planes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The Board of Thai Airways
International (Thai) has approved the airline's investment plan
that includes the purchase of 12 new aircraft over the next two
years, the Bangkok Post reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The aircraft comprise five Airbus a300-600rs and three
a330-300s, one Boeing b777-300 and one b747-400 to be ordered by
September 30 this year, and another each of the Boeings over the
next two years.
</P>
<P>
The company said the investment would enable Thai to operate
profitably and reduce the number of different aircraft types in
its fleet according to the company plan.
</P>
<P>
"This will help enhance efficiency in planning and readjusting
Thai's route network, aircraft operation and human resources
management which includes pilots and engineers," the company said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the plan would help Thai to meet the rising demand
for air travel as the economic recovery takes place, as well as
help to reduce operation costs.
</P>
<P>
Thai has been forced to cut costs to 2.7 billion baht (67.5
million U.S. dollars) this year as it tries to weather the
economic storm.
</P>
<P>
In December, the company announced an 18.3 percent slump in
profits for the first nine months of 1997, with huge foreign
exchange losses.

CHANGCHUN, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese railway engineers
planted 10.7 tons of explosives for a water diversion project in
the northeast part of the country in the biggest underwater
blasting job ever.
</P>
<P>
The job involved new underwater drilling and detonating
technology, today's "Economic Information Daily" reports.
</P>
<P>
Underwater drilling and detonating has been a difficult task
for construction workers because of the difficulty of fixing holes
and removing the mud, and some of the equipment and designs are
still at an experimental stage.
</P>
<P>
Workers from the Chinese Railway Ministry's 13th Engineering
Bureau and the Railway Construction, Research, Designing Institute
put up fixed platforms and used specially-designed drills and
emulsified oil explosives and improved detonation methods in
the middle of the Songhua River. The pump station will be used to

<HEADLINE> TB Cases Increase Among U.S. Immigrants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Tuberculosis (TB) cases among
the immigrants in the United States rose 6.5 percent last year
over 1992, experts reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The number climbed from 7,266 in 1992 to 7,735 in 1997, said
Dr. Marisa Moore, an epidemiologist with the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDCP).
</P>
<P>
Tuberculosis cases among the immigrants accounted for 27
percent of the national total in 1992 and for 39 percent of that
in 1997, he added.
</P>
<P>
However, CDCP experts pointed out, the number of TB cases
nationwide dropped in 1997 for the fifth year in a row following a
dramatic surge from the mid-1980s through 1992.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show there were 19,855 TB cases reported in the
U.S. last year, a 7 percent decrease from 1996 and a 26 percent
drop from 1992.
</P>
<P>
TB is more common in less industrialized countries where people
live closely together and there is less screening and treatment.
</P>
<P>
Worldwide, TB is a bigger killer than malaria and AIDS
combined. About two million to three million people worldwide die
from TB every year, including 100,000 children, according to the
World Health Organization.

<HEADLINE> Bank of Israel Unveils Drastic Currency Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Israel unveiled
Friday drastic proposals for liberalizing foreign exchange
controls, in a bid to realize the convertibility of local currency
the shekel.
</P>
<P>
In details leaked to the media, officials of the central bank
confirmed the key measures that Governor Jacob Frenkel has
submitted to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Finance
Minister Ya'acov Neeman for approval.
</P>
<P>
Under the new changes, citizens will be allowed to hold
foreign currency here without any existing restrictions anymore;
Israelis will be permitted to open accounts abroad and transfer
cash overseas in either shekel or foreign currency;
</P>
<P>
Individuals will be able to purchase apartments in Israel in
dollars; Investments in assets abroad will be unlimited; There
will be no restriction on the use of credit cards abroad; In
emergency cases, the few remaining restrictions will also be
lifted.
</P>
<P>
The reform plan was unveiled apparently in an attempt to calm
the unstable local currency markets that witnessed drastic
devaluation of the shekel in the past week amid reports of the
changes.
</P>
<P>
In last week's currency trading, the shekel depreciated by as
much as 1.82 percent in a single day, and the exchange rate ended
the week at 3.692 shekels against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
Some remaining restrictions on foreign currency will affect
only institutional investors, over which there is an ongoing
disagreement between the Finance Ministry and Bank of Israel. The
central bank refuses to lift those restrictions until the Finance
Ministry agrees to implement tax changes which will govern their
operations overseas.
</P>
<P>
Despite the existing differences among Netanyahu, Neeman and
Frenkel over the contents and timing of the official announcement
of the currency liberalization plan, the three are of one mind
about the desired results of the changes: the shekel will be fully
convertible.
</P>
<P>
The speculation for the announcement of the reform is on or
before the upcoming Independence Day, April 30, but its
implementation will take longer.

<HEADLINE> UN Envoy Warns Afghan War Would Spread Across Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 10 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Special Envoy on
Afghanistan Lakhdar Brahimi warned here Friday the prolonged
Afghan conflict would spread across the border to other countries
if lasting peace cannot be restored in the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi, who is currently visiting the region on a three-week
fresh peace mission on Afghanistan, sounded the warning when
addressing a news conference here at headquarters of the United
Nations Special Mission on Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"Of course, there is a danger that the Afghan war would spread
across the border," Brahimi said responding to a question. "You
see you cannot keep for ever the conflict within the border of
this country," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Brahimi, who arrived here on March 20 and visited
several Afghan neighboring countries, said he is "optimistic about
the peace process in Afghanistan."
</P>
<P>
The Algerian diplomat said the Afghan Islamic Taliban militia
and their rival Northern Alliance have agreed to sit together and
try to find a solution to the conflict.
</P>
<P>
The Joint Steering Committee composed of delegates from both
sides will meet soon in Islamabad to prepare for an Ulema
(religious scholars) conference between them, Brahimi said,
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the two Afghan warring groups would
decide a date as soon as possible for the Taliban proposed Ulema
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Brahimi said, as part of his mission, he will proceed
to Tehran, capital of Iran, Saturday to consult Iranian leaders on
the Afghan issue and he also meet ousted Afghan president
Burhannuddin Rabbani, Head of the Northern Alliance, there.
</P>
<P>
He held talks Thursday in Kabul with Mohammad Rabbani, Chairman
of Taliban's Supreme Council, who said that the militia is looking
forward to talks with the Northern Alliance.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. special envoy had also already held talks with leaders
of Pakistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and the representatives of
the Northern Alliance.

KUALA LUMPUR, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Foreign Minister
Abdullah Ahmad Badawi Friday urged the private sector,
particularly the ASEAN Chambers of Commerce and Industry (CCI), to
make greater contribution to regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Opening the 13th ASEAN-CCI Conference and the 55th ASEAN-CCI
Council meeting here Friday, Abdullah said: "Whether ASEAN achieve
its objective in creating a free-trade area will to some extent
depend on the private sector contribution."
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the ASEAN-CCI embark on programs to encourage
people in the region to resort to greater use of products produced
locally within the region to bring about greater intra-ASEAN
trade.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah also appealed to the ASEAN-CCI to embark on action
that would help countries of ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian
Nations) find new markets for their products outside the region.
</P>
<P>
"ASEAN-CCI could perhaps come out with a Plan of Action aimed
at promoting ASEAN as an investment destination. This could be
achieved if ASEAN-CCI could undertake investment missions to sell
our region and not to solely depend on the governments to carry
out the promotion efforts," he said.
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony, ASEAN-CCI and the Chamber of Commerce
and Industry of the Russian Federation signed a cooperation
agreement.
</P>

The conference and council meeting are being attended by some
70 businessmen, senior executives and representatives of chambers

Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore,

NEW DELHI, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Indian Finance Minister
Yashwant Sinha said India was opposed to the International Patent
Law which he said was adversely affecting the interests of a
developing country like India, the Pioneer reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
India was determined to seek its revision in the World Trade
Organization (WTO) with the help of developing countries, Sinha
said here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The former Congress government committed a big blunder by
signing the agreement under pressure from powerful countries, he
said.
</P>
<P>
A country like India should withstand pressure and not enter
into an agreement which affects its long-term interests, he said.
</P>
<P>
Sinha also hinted that he was opposed to making the Indian
currency fully convertible. India must learn from the acute
financial crisis that recently gripped several nations of
Southeast Asia, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Indian market had survived the chaos in Southeast Asia
because of the inherent strength of the country's economy and also
for the reason that India had only introduced partial
convertibility, he explained.

<HEADLINE> China Designates New Model Scientist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Most major Beijing-based
newspapers today carried articles introducing Jiang
Xinsong, the "father of China's robotics industry".
</P>
<P>
The articles called on Chinese scientists to emulate Jiang's
actions by formulating new development strategies for their own
disciplines and promoting scientific developments in China.
</P>
<P>
Jiang is the first person designated as a model scientist since
the early 1990s by six ministries under the State Council and
related departments of the CPC Central Committee, including the
Ministry of Science and Technology (MST) and the Chinese Academy
of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
China's new cabinet recently listed the use of science and
technology to rejuvenate the nation as a top priority.
</P>
<P>
A MST official pointed out that China has altered past
practices and is now calling for scientists not only to conduct
research, but also to formulate future scientific development
plans in their respective disciplines.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, a leading scientist in the field of automation and
former director of the Shenyang Institute of Automation, suffered
a heart attack and passed away in 1997 at the age of 66. Jiang
contributed numerous outstanding achievements for China's robotics
industry, especially to the development of the state-of-the-art
remote-controlled submergible robot capable of working at depths
of 6,000 meters.
</P>
<P>
Jiang led the center's efforts to develop submergible robots
for use in China's offshore oil and marine development. The center
has also exported a number of robots to the United States.
</P>
<P>
He also played a major role in establishing the National
Robotics Engineering Center which has developed numerous robotic
applications for the nation's automobile and motorcycle
manufacturers.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Privatization of the planned Nong
Ngu Hao International Airport, Don Muang airport and three in the
provinces loomed large, as a program that would generate funds
needed to build Nong Ngu Hao won approval.
</P>
<P>
The planned Nong Ngu Hao Airport, Bangkok's second
international airport, is estimated to cost 120-140 billion baht
(3-3.5 billion U.S. dollars), the Bangkok Post said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The government plans to build Nong Ngu Hao as the country's
main international airport, while trimming funds for the Don Muang
airport expansion to four billion baht (100 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Under the program approved by the government's privatization
committee, 30 percent of the shares in the new Bangkok
International Airport Co, which will build Nong Ngu Hao, will be
sold to private investors.
</P>
<P>
The rest will stay in government hands, paid for using state
funds and loans from the Japan Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund.
The Airport Authority of Thailand currently holds all the shares.
</P>
<P>
Privatization of Don Muang airport and those in the northern
cities of Chiang Mai and Chiang Rai and the southern city of Hat
Yai will be handled by three new companies.
</P>
<P>
Supachai Panitchpakdi, the committee chairman and deputy prime
minister, said the Transport and Communications Ministry would now
be able to speed up privatization of the three regional airports
to raise money for Nong Ngu Hao.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The Board of Thai Airways
International (THAI) has approved the airline's investment plan
that includes the purchase of 12 new aircraft over the next two
years, the Bangkok Post reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The aircraft include five Airbus A300-600rs and three
A330-300s, one Boeing B777-300 and one B747-400 to be delivered by
September 30 this year, and another each of the Boeings over the
next two years.
</P>
<P>
The company said the investment would enable THAI to operate
profitably and reduce the number of different aircraft types in
its fleet.
</P>
<P>
"This will help enhance efficiency in planning and readjusting
THAI's route network, aircraft operation and human resources
management which includes pilots and engineers," the company said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The plan would also help THAI to meet the rising demand for air
travel as the economic recovery takes place, as well as help to
reduce operation costs.
</P>
<P>
THAI has been forced to cut costs to 2.7 billion baht (67.5
million U.S. dollars) this year as it tries to weather the
economic storm.
</P>
<P>
Last December, the company announced an 18.3 percent slump in
profits for the first nine months of 1997, with huge foreign
exchange losses.

<HEADLINE> Cooperation Between Bosnia, Slovenia to be Promoted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LJUBLJANA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Visiting President of the
Presidency of the Republic of Bosnia, Alija Izetbegovic, Thursday
called for an earlier signing of agreement between Bosnia and
Slovenia on protecting investment.
</P>
<P>
During his talks here with Slovenian Prime Minister Janez
Drnovsek, Izetbegovic also expected Slovenia to pay back the debt
owed by the Ljubljana Bank to Bosnia and relax the restrictions on
entry visa for Bosnian citizens.
</P>
<P>
An earlier settlement of those issues will help further
strengthen the bilateral ties and cooperation, he added.
</P>
<P>
Drnovsek said that Slovenia will adhere to the policy of
promoting ties with Bosnia and cooperation between the two
countries' enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Slovenia will try its best to solve the existing problems
between the two countries, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Slovenia supports Bosnia in its efforts to join the European
Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, he added.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Izetbegovic thanked Slovenia for adhering to
the principle that Bosnia should be a unified country comprising
several ethnic entities.
</P>
<P>
Izetbegovic arrived in Ljubljana, the capital of Slovenia, on
Thursday afternoon for a two-day state visit. He also held talks
with Slovenian President Milan Kucan on Thursday on the current
situation in Bosnia and the whole former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Since they established diplomatic ties in October 1992, the two
countries have seen frequent exchanges of high-level visits and
steady enhancement of bilateral economic and trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Trade volume between them reached 318 million U.S. dollars last
year, a 14 percent increase over 1996. Recently, the Slovenian
authorities announced that it will provide 180 million dollars for
32 projects in Bosnia.

<HEADLINE> LTTE Attempt to Attack Telecom Complex Foiled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 10 (Xinhua) -- An attempt by the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) to attack the Sri Lanka Telecom
Complex in Colombo has been foiled by police, the Island newspaper
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Four LTTE informants who tried to obtain information about a
high-security zone around the Telecom building had been taken into
custody, police sources told the newspaper Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to the informants, the LTTE was planning an attack
"very soon." The high-security zone is an obstacle to the planned
rebel attack, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The arrested LTTE informants had reportedly confessed that they
were sent to obtain information about ways of entering the Telecom
premises.
</P>
<P>
More rebels are already in Colombo to prepare for the attack, a
senior police official said, giving no details due to security
reasons.
</P>
<P>
Acting upon information received about a group of LTTE rebels
now in the capital city, security forces are conducting intense
search operations, the police sources said.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE is fighting for a homeland for minority Tamils in Sri
Lanka's north and east in a war which began in 1983.
</P>
<P>
On March 5 this year, a car bomb attack in downtown Colombo
carried out by a LTTE a suicide rebel killed at least 38 people
and injured about 300 others. Thirty-six vehicles and several
shops nearby were destroyed in the blast.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Economy Worsening: EPA Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Japan's Economic Planning Agency
(EPA) said Friday the country's weak economy has worsened due to
sluggish consumer spending and grim corporate outlook.
</P>
<P>
Downgrading its assessment of the economy from the preceding month,
the agency said in a monthly report for April that "the economy
remains stagnant and the situation is more severe than before."
</P>
<P>
"Private consumption has remained sluggish, as households are
affected by uncertainties about the course of the economy," the agency
said.
</P>
<P>
Private consumption accounts for 59 percent of 480 trillion yen
(3.64 trillion U.S. dollars) of the gross domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
The average ratio of monthly household expenditure to
disposable income dropped 3.5 percent in five months to 68.4
percent in February, an EPA official said.
</P>
<P>
Among other indices of private consumption, auto sales plunged
a preliminary 19.4 percent in March from a year earlier, while
department store sales fell 5.4 percent in February.
</P>
<P>
Referring to corporate capital spending, another major element
of GDP, the EPA said, "The tendency of companies to whittle down
capital outlays on plant and equipment has become more
conspicuous."
</P>
<P>
The EPA also said Japan's job market is tighter, with the
unemployment rate at a record of 3.6 percent in February.
</P>
<P>
The report also said industrial production had been on a
downward path, a preliminary 3.1 percent fall in February from a
year earlier, a revised 3.3 percent drop in January and a one
percent fall in December.
</P>
<P>
The agency noted even the growth rate of exports, which have
buttressed the economy in recent months, began to slow as a result
of the decline in exports to Asian countries.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Official: China indispensable in Nonproliferation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 9 (Xinhua) -- A senior U.S. official said on
Thursday that his government put nonproliferation of weapons of
mass destruction at the core of its national security strategy and
China was indispensable to its efforts.
</P>
<P>
Acting Undersecretary of State John Holum said that there is no
higher priority for U.S. leaders than nonproliferation, and the
U.S. has a very high stake in cooperating with China to this end.
</P>
<P>
"China has made enormous progress in this area," noted Holum,
who has just returned from a trip to China.
</P>
<P>
Beijing joined the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty in 1992. It
stopped nuclear testing and agreed to the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Holum said his trip to China the week before last was aimed at
continuing to work with China in advancing the common
goal of preventing proliferation.
</P>
<P>
However, he did not expect new achievements during the June
Sino-American summit, at which U.S. President Bill Clinton will
meet Chinese counterpart Jiang Zemin to discuss a wide range of
issues.
</P>
<P>
"This summit comes very closely after the October summit. There
are hard issues that we expect a long engagement with China
on.... It will take some time before we have a tangible outcome,"
said the official, who handles arms control and international
security affairs.
</P>
<P>
Holum said that the U.S. is ready to expand cooperation in
space launches with China in exchange for stronger controls
over missile technology.
</P>
<P>
"As that happens, as you see in the case of the Nuclear
Cooperation Agreement, we would be prepared to increase our
cooperation in space launches, increase the number, for example,
of U.S. satellites that could be launched using Chinese boosters,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Holum hoped that China would join the Missile Technology
Control Regime (MTCR) so as to make missile technology transfer to
China easier.
</P>
<P>
Holum said that he did not offer missile technology to China
during his recent trip. However, he noted there was apparently
some belief that the missile technology transfer to China is
inevitable.
</P>
<P>
He believed that joining MTCR could expedite the transfer. But
he suspected it would be some time before the Chinese are
interested in becoming part of the regime.
</P>
<P>
In October 1994, China agreed to apply by the principle of
inherent capability. It also agreed not to sell MTCR class
ground-to-ground missiles anywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
The MTCR covers payloads of 500 kilograms carried 300
kilometers. Inherent capability means that if something had a
heavier weight, it would still have the inherent capability to
meet those parameters, Holum explained.
</P>
<P>
"Now our indications are that we have no reason to believe they
have violated those specific commitments," he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Trade Mission to Visit China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 9 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. trade mission is leaving
for China this weekend to promote expanded trade opportunities for
American firms, a senior Commerce Department official announced
here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Undersecretary of Commerce David Aaron told a press conference
that he will lead a delegation of 18 business leaders from small,
medium and large companies, to Beijing on April 13. They will also
visit Shanghai and Hong Kong before heading back home on April 18.
</P>
<P>
The sectors represented on the delegation include engineering,
design and construction, information technologies, machine tools,
insurance and project finance.
</P>
<P>
Aaron said that he would meet Chinese officials and co-chair
the first subministerial review under the U.S.-China Joint
Commission on Commerce and Trade.
</P>
<P>
"The mission and commercial dialogue take on special
significance in light of both the Asian financial crisis and the
strong U.S.-Chinese desire to build momentum in our bilateral
relations ahead of the presidential summit in June," he said.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton has announced that he will visit China
in late June. Aaron said that he will work to lay the commercial
groundwork for the upcoming summit, the second since President
Jiang Zemin of China visited the United States in late October.
</P>
<P>
Aaron said that his trip is aimed at improving the business
climate for American companies in China and helping U.S. firms
maximize export opportunities to create new jobs and economic
growth at home.
</P>
<P>
He reinterated U.S. concern that the trade deficit between the
two countries is still on the increase, urging for concrete and
rapid actions to balance the imbalance.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. said that the trade deficit was as high as up to 49.7
billion U.S. dollars in 1997, a five fold increase in ten years.
However, the figure given by China is much smaller.
</P>
<P>
"The deficit cannot continue on its current path -- it is
politically unsustainable," Aaron said. "China is our fourth
largest supplier, but only our 15th largest market."
</P>
<P>
The official realized that the Chinese side shares the desire
to narrow the trade imbalance. However, he declined to comment on
the possible lifting of ban on high-tech exports to China.
</P>
<P>
China complained that the ban has limited China's imports from
the United States. Earlier, a U.S. official said that the ban
would be lifted on a case-by-base basis.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-China agreement on peaceful nuclear cooperation took
into effect last month after over a decade in paper. Aaron replied
to Xinhua that nuclear cooperation would be discussed during his
trip and his delegation includes members from U.S. companies
competent in this field.
</P>
<P>
Aaron believed that insurance is one of the fastest growing
sectors of the Chinese economy and a priority market for U.S.
firms.
</P>
<P>
According to his account, Between 1993 and 1997, China
insurance market grew at an average annual rate of 33 percent,
reaching 12 billion dollars in premiums last year and providing a
key component for infrastructure and investment in that country.
</P>
<P>
"In light of the upcoming president summit, I believe we have
an opportunity, if China continues its economic reforms, to
introduce a new, very positive dialogue with the country in a host
of areas that will advance our long-term, mutually beneficial
economic and commercial interests," Aaron said.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Not to Use Force to Repatriate Illegal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's Labor Minister
Trairong Suwankhiri said his government would not use force to
repatriate more than 300,000 illegal workers from the country.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has ordered the illegal workers to leave by the end of
the month.
</P>
<P>
"We expect that about 300,000 illegal workers will be
repatriated without force by the end of April," Trairong said in
remarks published by Friday's Nation newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has also directed nine industrial sectors hiring
foreign workers to dismiss those who ask for a long leave and
replace them with Thai workers.
</P>
<P>
"We have to do this because we face our own unemployment
problems. More than 300,000 unemployed Thais have applied for jobs
with the ministry," Trairong said.
</P>
<P>
"The license to hire legal workers will expire in June and we
will not renew their licenses, except for those working in fishing
industry," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Smugglers of foreign workers face up to 10 years in jail,
employers face three and those who harbor illegals face up to five
years.

<HEADLINE> China to Restructure Petrochemical Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 10 (Xinhua) -- In the reform of its
petrochemical industry, China will form two large enterprise
groups in May or June to integrate upstream and downstream
production of the sector.
</P>
<P>
The State Administration of Petroleum and Chemical Industry has
been established in line with the reform plan adopted at the First
Session of the Ninth National People's Congress held in March. The
new administration was formed on the basis of the former Ministry
of Chemical Industry, China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) and
China National Petrochemical Corp (Sinopec).
</P>
<P>
The administration is directly under the jurisdiction of the
State Economic and Trade Commission (SETC).
</P>
<P>
According to SETC Minister Sheng Huaren, the two giant groups,
the Southern Group and the Northern Group, will control all oil
and gas fields, oil refineries, petrochemical enterprises, and
petroleum and chemical enterprises under the abolished ministry,
CNPC and Sinopec.
</P>
<P>
Plans also call for the establishment of a number of large
fertilizer and other chemicals enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Sheng said the Northern Group will control oil and gas fields,
oil refineries and petrochemical plants in north and west China
and the Southern Group will control related facilities in the east
and south.
</P>
<P>
The former will concentrate on exploration and production of
oil and gas, while the latter will prioritize the production of
petrochemicals, said Sheng.
</P>
<P>
Sheng said the restructuring will be carried out in line with
principles of the market economy.
</P>
<P>
Experts predict that the two giant entherprise groups will
enter the rank of the world's top 500 companies in terms of sales
revenues. Endithem

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Immigrants Break into Embassies in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Groups of Indonesian
immigrants broke into the compounds of the United States, Swiss
and French embassies and the Istana Sharif Ali (Sharif Ali Palace)
belonging to the Brunei government, here Friday morning, police
and embassy sources said.
</P>
<P>
Eight Indonesians scaled a three-meter high wall to enter the
U.S. embassy ground, another eight climbed over the gate of the
French embassy, a dozen entered the Swiss mission and seven into
the Istana Sharif Ali, according to assistant police commissioner
Bakri Zinim.
</P>
<P>
The three missions and the palace are located near each other
in the diplomatic enclave in the downtown.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian immigrants claimed to be Acehnese, seeking
political asylum.
</P>
<P>
Police said several Acehnese groups are also believed to be
trying to get into several other embassies.
</P>
<P>
Three Federal Reserve Unit (FRU) troops have rushed to the
diplomatic enclave.
</P>
<P>
At 10:00 am, police were seen escorting out eight immigrants
out of the French embassy.
</P>
<P>
U.S. embassy press officer James Warren said the eight had
scaled a side wall of the embassy and one was injured slightly in
a scuffle with security guards. "They are in the compound now,"
Warren added.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. embassy has contacted the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) here to deal with the situation,
he said.
</P>
<P>
A group of 14 Achenese in a lorry forced into the compound of
the UNHCR two weeks ago, seeking political asylum.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia, faced with the influx of immigrants especially
Indonesians, has begun a large-scale operation to deport all
illegal immigrants including Indonesians and Bangladeshis.

<HEADLINE> Ukrainian Industrial Output Value Rises in First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine's total industrial output
value rose by 1.7 percent in the first three months of this year
and the gross domestic product (GDP) in March reversed the decline
trend to see an increase of 0.2 percent, a government official was
quoted as saying Thursday by the Ukrainian Inter Fax News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a cabinet meeting, Chairman of State Statistics
Committee Alexanr Osaulenko, said this was Ukraine's first
industrial increase in years, which were signs for favorable
conditions for a sustained steady economic growth.
</P>
<P>
He added the upward trend in industry contributed to the
reverse of GDP decline. Among the industrial sectors, he cited,
both the timber processing and paper making sectors went up by
25.7 percent, the nonferrous metallurgy sector, 15.2 percent and
the building materials sector, 14.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, Minister of Economy Viktor Suslov held different
views on the issue. Arguing that Ukraine's national economy was
still serious, he said, the increase in industrial output value in
the period was realized by making use of the over three billion
Hrivnes (about 1.5 billion U.S. dollars) worth of state reserve
materials.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Lower Minimum Capital for Sound Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government will
soon issue a new regulation requiring a sound bank to have a
minimum capital of 250 billion rupiah (30 million U.S. dollars),
instead of one trillion rupiah (about 122 million dollars) set
previously, a senior official said.
</P>
<P>
All sound banks must fulfill the new minimum capital
requirement this year, Finance Minister Fuad Bawazier said
Thursday after a meeting with the National Banking Association
(Perbanas) members, the official Antara News Agency reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The government had earlier set the minimum capital of a sound
bank at one trillion rupiah for this year and two trillion for
1999.
</P>
<P>
But many bankers said the proposed minimum capital is too high
for small and medium-sized banks, especially the private ones.
That target would bring a number of banks to the brink of
bankruptcy, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Bawazier said the minimum capital stipulated in the old
regulation constituted gross capital which still must be deducted
from doubtful credits and harmful assets.
</P>
<P>
"We give the chance to the banks to write off their doubtful
credits and harmful assets," he said.
</P>
<P>
The banks which had written off their harmful assets and
doubtful credits would be audited by a public accountant and the
audit result would later be reviewed by Bank Indonesia (central
bank), he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister dismissed assumptions that the move would
discourage bank merger. "Not really, because a clean and
unproblematic bank with an authorized capital of 250 billion
rupiah could merge with other banks...," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government has closed down 16 private banks,
suspended seven troubled commercial banks and put seven others
under the supervision of the Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency
(IBRA) since October last year as part of its banking reform.
</P>
<P>
In the last few months, a number of banks have also announced
their merger plans.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Conducts Second Fertility Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar is disseminating the
findings of its fertility and reproductive health survey (FRHS)
which is to determine the accurate fertility level in the country.
</P>
<P>
A workshop jointly sponsored by the Myanmar Ministry of
Immigration and Population and the United Nations Population Fund
(UNFPA) was held here on Thursday on a draft preliminary report on
the survey which was conducted in the first quarter of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The FRHS, the second country-wide demographic survey undertaken
by the Myanmar Population Department, is part of the country's
efforts to strengthen its birth spacing program implemented by the
Myanmar Health Department and funded by the UNFPA.
</P>
<P>
The survey was designed to produce reliable estimates of major
survey variables for the whole country, including both urban and
rural areas, Myanmar Minister of Immigration and Population U Saw
Tun was quoted by Friday's New Light of Myanmar newspaper as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The first survey -- population changes and fertility survey
(PCFS) -- was conducted in 1991 in the country, and It showed
Myanmar's fertility rate stood at 3.5. In the 1997 survey, it
dropped to 2.8.
</P>
<P>
The contraceptive prevalence rate in the PCFS was 16.8 percent
and it has risen to 32.7 percent in the FRHS.
</P>
<P>
The infant mortality rate in the 1991 survey was 94 per
thousand livebirths but it declined to 67 per thousand in the
FRHS.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from government departnments, non-governmental
organizations and the UNFPA as well as other U.N. agencies
attended the workshop.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Records Negative Growth in Fixed Asset Investments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 10 (Xinhua) -- For the first time in the past
five years, Shanghai recorded a 13-percent drop in fixed asset
investments in January and February this year.
</P>
<P>
The municipal statistics bureau reported that the
municipality's total fixed asset investments in the period stood
at 8.58 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The declining investments led to a 7.7-percent growth rate in
the Gross Domestic Product in the first two months of this year,
also the lowest in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
The industrial sector of the city witnessed a one-percent
increase in fixed asset investments while the other sectors,
including infrastructure and real estate, all recorded declines,
some being as high as 67 percent.
</P>
<P>
Fixed asset investments are considered to be the barometer of
overall economic development. Growth rates for the municipality's
fixed asset investments ranged from 35 percent to 85 percent in
January and February of the previous four years. And, GDP
growth rates remained above 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
A bureau economist said the figures indicate that the
municipality is paying greater attention to the quality of the
economy, rather than solely growth in the GDP.

<HEADLINE> Italy to Save up to 14 Trillion Lire Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Under a three-year economic plan, the
Italian government will save up to 14 trillion lire (7.8 billion
U.S. dollars) in its next year's budget, said union leaders after
a meeting with government officials.
</P>
<P>
The government also confirmed repayment of 60 percent of the
special one-off levy the Italian people paid to help the budget
deficit meet single currency requirements this years, the leaders
said.
</P>
<P>
One of the union leaders, Sergio Larizza of Uil, said 8-9
trillion lire would be enough to keep the budget deficit within
the required three percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) next
year.
</P>
<P>
The other five trillion lire saved in the budget will go entirely
to initiatives to stock growth and create jobs, mainly in Italy's
depressed south, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Italian government has pledged to keep its deficit within
the three percent limit and release more funds to create jobs.
</P>
<P>
Italy forecasts an economic growth of up to 2.9 percent in the
next three years and a steady rise in employment rate from 0.7
percent in 1999, 0.9 percent in 2000, to one percent in 2001.

<HEADLINE> Democratic Raises 12.4-Million Dollar Campaign Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
helped the Democratic National Committee raise 12.4 million
dollars in campaign contributions in the first quarter months of
1998.
</P>
<P>
National Chairman Steve Grossman said the party is on a strong
enough financial footing to promise financial support for
candidates in tough races this fall.
</P>
<P>
It is a marked contrast to last fall. Democrats were forced to
stay on the financial sidelines as Republicans poured hundreds of
thousands of dollars into the New Jersey and Virginia
gubernatorial elections and a special congressional election in
New York City. Republican candidates won all three races.
</P>
<P>
"We're ready to make some significant investments in the 1998
campaign," Grossman said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton averaged two to three fund-raising appearances a month
during the first three months of 1998, a boon for the fiscally
plagued Democrats. Vice President Al Gore also has been a prolific
fund-raiser for the party.
</P>
<P>
"The president and vice president are hugely important to us,"
Grossman said. "They have promised to continue to help raise money
on behalf of this party. They are determined to make us
competitive."
</P>
<P>
Of the Democratic donations, 4.6 million dollars came in the
form of so-called soft money -- donations that are supposed to be
used only for generic party activities, and not subject to federal
contribution limits.
</P>
<P>
The party last year lifted its ban on contributions of 100,000
dollars or more and took in nine such large donations between
January and March, including 145,000 dollars from the film company
Miramax, 100,500 dollars from the National Education Association
and 100,000 dollars from the law firm of party finance chairman
Leonard Barrack.
</P>
<P>
During the equivalent period in 1994, the last nonpresidential
election year, the committee raised 10.2 million dollars,
including 5.9 million dollars in soft money.

<HEADLINE> NCR System to Facilitate Bill Clearing in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The US-based NCR Corp, the
world's leading supplier of electronic banking solutions, signed a
contract on Wednesday to offer an intra-city automatic cheque
clearing and sorting system to the People's Bank of China (PBOC)
Beijing Branch.
</P>
<P>
The system, to be completed around July, will terminate manual
bill sorting in the capital, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The system consists of two NCR WorldMark 4300 mainframe
computers, seven NCR 6760 cheque reader/sorters -- each capable of
handling 1,000 cheques per minute -- and some other peripherals.
</P>
<P>
Beijing is the fourth city in China to adopt NCR's
cheque-clearing systems, following Guangzhou, Kunming and Chengdu.
</P>
<P>
The system will cover more than 1,000 branches in Beijing and
the surrounding areas. When completed, Beijing will become one of
the country's largest cheque processing centers, capable of
handling 300,000 bills every day, with settled volume exceeding 30
billion yuan (3.6 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The PBOC is launching a drive to spread computerized banking
payment and settlement around the country. Yu Conglin,
vice-president of the PBOC Beijing Branch, said the NCR system was
a key part of the PBOC's computerization project.
</P>
<P>
China has become the company's fifth largest market. Last year,
NCR sold 1,300 automatic teller machines (ATMs) in China. In
January this year, it set up a joint venture here in Beijing with
the Beijing Cable and Wire Co., which costs 20 million
U.S. dollars with the American side holding 70 percent of the
stake. The joint venture will produce 10,000 ATMs every year.

<P>
PANAMA CITY, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Around 6,000 hectares of
Panama's tropical forest have been destroyed in 300 fires over the
last few weeks, Panamanian environment protection authorities said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Cerro Hoya National Park in the provinces of Veraguas and
Los Santos, the Camino de Cruces Park, near the capital city, and
the sector Filo del Tallo in the Darien province are among the
most affected areas.
</P>
<P>
The fires killed wildlife and degraded the soil, said the
National Renewable Natural Resources, adding that the destroyed
forests will need at least 60 years to recover.
</P>
<P>
More than 50 communities are suffering water shortages with the
destruction of the water reserves that supply rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Indiscriminate burning was the main cause of the fires, which
advanced without control towards the forest reserves and caused
severe ecological damage.

<HEADLINE> El Nino Causes Big Losses to Ecuadoran Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The El Nino phenomenon affected some
152,865 hectares of farm land in Ecuador between November of 1997
and March of 1998, said a study by the Agriculture and Livestock
Ministry Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The study showed that rice is the most affected in the five
provinces of the coast and ten of the sierra, representing an
economic loss of 1,100 million dollars while banana production
suffered a loss of 114 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The rains brought by the El Nino late last year damped the
coffee plants. As a result, 1998's harvest will diminish to 1.4
million 60-kilogram bags and exports will be reduced to 750,000
bags.
</P>
<P>
Rains also affected the blossoming of the cacao plants to cause
an export deficit of 30,000 tons and a loss of 37 million dollars
this year, said the study.

<HEADLINE> WB to Intensify Its Support to China's Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- World Bank Vice-President for the
East Asia and Pacific Region Jean-Michel Severino said here today
that the World Bank is prepared to intensify its support to
China's on-going reforms through both lending and non-lending
services.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference in Beijing, Severino said WB is
actively discussing with related Chinese government agencies on a
wide range of specific activities including pilot programs,
seminars, technical assistance and training in the country's
financial and state-owned enterprises areas which are experiencing
fundamental reforms.
</P>
<P>
Severino expressed WB's readiness to assist the government to
achieve its goal by helping to develop infrastructure investment
funds and use of bond financing linked to WB projects, so as to
promote greater reliance on private domestic savings rather than
on government revenues.
</P>
<P>
He said that WB is also prepared to provide help in developing
a legal framework conducive to attracting private infrastructure
capital and financing and in developing China's capital market for
infrastructure development.
</P>
<P>
In addition, in support of the government's focus on
infrastructure and urban development, WB is prepared to develop
more comprehensive urban development projects by working with
medium to large cities to reform and develop housing markets,
expand water and sewage services and rationalize urban transport,
he said.

stevedoring company Patrick docks on Thursday in the nation's

<P>
The Age:

<P>
"The Taliban are looking forward to this meeting," he was

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Making Efforts to Solve Refugee Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic said Thursday that his nation was improving its
cooperation with neighbors to help speed up the return of refugees.
</P>
<P>
His government would pay more attention to developing ties with
neighboring countries, Milosevic said during his talks with
visiting U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, Sadako Ogata.
</P>
<P>
According to the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees, since 1991, about three million people in the former
Yugoslavia have become refugees, two million of them from
Bosnia. The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has taken in 600,000
refugees.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic told Ogata that Yugoslavia had tried its utmost to
provide the refugees with the necessities for living, working and
education.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav Foreign Minister Zivorad Jovanovic also met Ogata on
Thursday and said that Yugoslavia, which accepted the largest
number of refugees in Europe, had allocated one billion
U.S. dollars for housing them.
</P>
<P>
Ogata praised the efforts by the Yugoslav government to house
the refugees. She also voiced concern over the complicated
situation of refugees throughout the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Ogata will visit Kosovo, a troubled province of Serbia,
Macedonia and Bosnia in the next few days.

<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Czech Foreign Minister
Jaroslav Sedivy Thursday opposed the imposition of any economic
sanction against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference with his Bulgarian
counterpart Nadezhda Mihailova, Sedivy said such sanction would
only create a situation ripe for criminal activities, particularly
for the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral relations, Sedivy confirmed the interest of his
country in Bulgaria's becoming a full member of the European Union
and the North Altantic Treaty Organization in the near future.
</P>
<P>
During his one-day stay here, Sedivy and Mihailova also signed three
documents on social and economic matters, including one for their
governments to readmit citizens overstaying their visas in
each other's country, one on the avoiding of dual taxation and one
on trade.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thursday Sedivy also met Bulgarian President Peter
Stoyanov, Prime Minister Ivan Kostov and National Assembly

<HEADLINE> Exports of Light Industrial Products, Handicrafts to Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Exports of light-industrial
products and handicrafts of China are expected to keep a high
growth rate in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Sources report that the country's light industrial products and
handicrafts are mainly exported to the United States, Europe,
Japan as well as to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In 1997 alone, exports of light industrial products and
handicrafts to the United States, Europe and Hong Kong increased
20 to 30 percent. In spite of the financial crisis in Southeast
Asia, exports to the area still increased.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the steady growth rate in the world economy
will provide a favorable environment for the export of Chinese
light industrial products and handicrafts. And the national
economy's high growth and low inflation will also create good
conditions.
</P>
<P>
According to experts, light industrial enterprises and
handicraft companies should make greater efforts to expand the
market by improving structure and quality of their products.

<HEADLINE> N.Irish Talks Set to Go Beyond Deadline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland's political
parties were expected to keep talking beyond the midnight deadline
to try to reach a peace settlement.
</P>
<P>
The intensive talks were joined throughout the day by British
Prime Minister Tony Blair and his Irish counterpart Bertie Ahern
who were making the last-ditch efforts to get a deal reached.
</P>
<P>
They had a series of meetings with leaders of the eight
political parties involved in the talks in order to bridge gaps in
the hope of setting the province on the path to a stable future.
</P>
<P>
"The force of the clock ticking towards midnight is a very
powerful one," said Blair's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"There have been ups and downs today but he (Blair) has still
got a hunch we are going to get there," the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
Despite progress on one of the major problems -- that of cross
border bodies -- there was no firm deal yet.
</P>
<P>
The major dispute between the pro-British unionists and
pro-Irish nationalists were on the role and powers of a proposed
all-Ireland ministerial council, and its links to a planned
Northern Ireland assembly.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the major loyalist party Ulster Unionist Party (UUP)
leader David Trimble received an endorsement Thursday night by his
party's ruling executive for his peace talks strategy. UUP
rejected a draft peace agreement on Tuesday presented by talks
chairman George Mitchell, a former U.S. senator, making the peace
process into a deadlock.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein, political arm of the outlawed Irish Republican Army,
on Thursday night accused the pro-British Ulster Unionists of
blocking an agreement by trying to change the direction of the
talks.
</P>
<P>
"As I speak to you now there is no agreement," said Sinn Fein
negotiator Martin McGuinness. "The reason for that is because
Unionists are blocking agreement."
</P>
<P>
However, some sources said there was still a chance of reaching
a deal by the parties involved in the talks.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Intervention Props up Weak yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Japan's move to intervene the
foreign exchange markets Thursday made the faltering yen
destabilizing further.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. dollar plunged to about 129 yen and fetched 131.18 yen
at the closing in New York, compared with 131.19 late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In the pre-Easter trading, the Bank of Japan bought yen in New
York, hoping to reverse losses that pushed the Japanese currency
last week to its lowest level in more than 6 years at 135.2 yen to
the dollar. The bank sold between 1 billion and 2 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin issued a statement in
support of the move.
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in New York compared with late rates
Wednesday included: 1.8123 German marks, down from 1.8224; 1.5068
Swiss francs, down from 1.5155; 6.0790 French francs, down from
6.1075; and 1.4245 Canadian dollars, up from 1.4241.
</P>
<P>
The British pound was quoted at 1.6762 U.S. dollars, up from
1.6700 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
A strong dollar helps to restrain inflation in the United
States by keeping a lid on import prices.
</P>
<P>
However, it also makes U.S. goods more expensive on overseas.
In January, the U.S. trade deficit in goods and services hit a
record 12 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Japan's currency intervention came hours after Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto announced his country's largest-ever economic
stimulus package of 120 billion U.S. dollars would include a 15
billion U.S. dollar tax cut this year and another 15 billion U.S.
dollar next year.

<HEADLINE> China Wants to See Check to Arms Flow to Rwanda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The reactivation of the
U.N. Commission of inquiry on arms flow to Rwanda is a way of
curbing the flow, a Chinese delegate said here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Commission has done much work in the past and It is
important in ensuring that U.N. resolutions are implemented
effectively, said China's Deputy Representative to the United
Nations Shen Guofang at a Security Council meeting on Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
The Council adopted a resolution on Thursday requesting U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan to reactivate the Commission, set up
in 1995 to investigate violations of a U.N. arms embargo on Rwanda
following a 1994 genocide which killed some 500,000 ethnics.
</P>
<P>
The Commission suspended activity in late 1996 because of the
worsening conditions there.
</P>
<P>
The resolution said the Council recognized the need for renewed
investigation of the illegal flow of arms to Rwanda, which is
fueling violence and could lead to further acts of genocide.
</P>
<P>
Shen said the success of the Commission depends on the support
of the countries concerned and his delegation hopes that those
countries will provide information to the Commission to curb the
illegal flow of arms and solve the problem in an integrated
manner.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Welcome Japan's Move to Boost Yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The United States on Thursday
welcomed Japan's effort to bolster the yen's value by buying yen
and selling dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Japan sold dollars for yen in the New York currency
market early on Thursday and said the U.S. Federal Reserve had
helped out by doing the same on its behalf.
</P>
<P>
The action drove up the yen's value, which has fallen recently
against the dollar on doubts over Japan's weak economy and the
government's failure to do much about it.
</P>
<P>
The dollar sales pushed the dollar's value below 130 yen.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said he welcomed the
japanese intervention in foreign exchange markets.
</P>
<P>
"We share the concern expressed by the Japanese Prime Minister
(Ryutaro Hashimoto) about recent weakness in the yen, and in that
context we welcome the action taken by the Japanese authorities in
the exchange market to support the value of the yen," Rubin said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Exchange dealers said Rubin's support for the
intervention showed the United States was committed to stopping
the yen from falling in value and that was of greater significance
to the market than the amount of dollars sold.
</P>
<P>
"The signal to the market is probably more important than the
intervention itself," said Merrill Lynch senior financial analyst
David Horner.
</P>
<P>
Tokyo's move to boost the yen came less than a week before a
meeting in Washington of finance ministers from the Group of
Seven industrial nations, at which Japan's economy is expected
to take center stage.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Chrysler Corp., the No. 3
automaker of the U.S., said Thursday its first-quarter earnings
rose 2.2 percent to a record 1.052 billion U.S. dollars, powered
largely by sales of its new Dodge Durango sport utility vehicle.
</P>
<P>
The news also gave some stimulus to today's stock market. The
company's new Dodge Durango sport utility vehicle accounted for
nearly all of the increase, with shipments of 42,873 units in the
first quarter.
</P>
<P>
Despite the stronger shipments, Chrysler's profit per vehicle
fell to 1,143 U.S. dollars from 1,198 U.S. dollars a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Chrysler's share of the North American
vehicle market during the quarter rose to 16.4 percent from 15.6
percent a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The automaker has spent 5.4 billion U.S. dollars to buy back
180 million shares since 1995.

<HEADLINE> Two American Authors Call for End to Confront with China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 9 (Xinhua)-- Two American authors of a new book
on China calls on the United States to end confrontation with
China and follow a policy of "Dynamic Engagement."
</P>
<P>
"The sooner we bring an end to the cold war with China, the
better......" says Daniel Burstein and Arne De Kerjzer in their
newly published book "Big Dragon."
</P>
<P>
They say that they believe a constructive relationship between
the United States and China will be beneficial to American
business, to the larger interests of the U.S. economy, to American
strategic and political interests, and to the global interests of
peace and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
"Both the United States and China obviously have much to gain
from a constructive partnership," the authors note in Big Dragon.
</P>
<P>
"But even more important, the dangers to both sides-- and to
the world-- will be very great if today's politics of
confrontation continue to dominate the relationship," they warn.
</P>
<P>
The authors express their disaggreement with "fashionable"
allegation of "China threat" in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Both Burstein, the bestselling author of Yen!, and Keijzer,
author of three well-known books on China, are China specialists
in America. The book offers the first comprehensive look at China
and its future in the new era.
</P>
<P>
It also gives a practical blueprint for American business
people, policy-makers and concerned citizens alike as they
contemplate new strategies for dealing with China.
</P>
<P>
An aid to Burstein told Xinhua Thursday that the authors had
followed China closely and experienced firsthand since their
twenties.
</P>
<P>
They have been travelling to the Asian nation, doing business
there, and writing about it since the early seventies.
</P>
<P>
Big Dragon is based on their extensive research and first-hand
encounters with senior Chinese officials as well as the thinkers
and enterpreneurs who are helping creating the new Chinese economic
system.

<HEADLINE> US Believes Karadzic May Surrender </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Thursday that former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic could
turn himself in to the war criminal court in the Hague as space
for him to operate is shrinking.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at a regular briefing, State Department
spokesman James Rubin said he could not confirm if negotiations
were going on for the surrender of Karadzic, who was accused of
war crimes by the West.
</P>
<P>
"As far as any separate negotiations are concerned, if they're
occurring, it's up to the tribunal to talk about them. We hear
reports of this from time to time, and many times they turn out to
be smoke and no fire, so to speak," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman affirmed that it's time for Karadzic
to surrender himself.
</P>
<P>
"He is isolated, he is increasingly unable to operate, he's
increasingly unpopular, his supporters are reducing in number,
reducing in power and it, therefore, is the time for him to turn
himself in," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
Rubin declined to discuss Karadzic's whereabouts, although he
did say "I think we can eliminate Belarus" as a possibility.
</P>
<P>
One U.S. official who declined to be identified said he
understood Karadzic was still in Pale.
</P>
<P>
Le Monde, a French newspaper, reported on Thursday that
Karadzic had left Bosnia for another Eastern European state and
may soon appear before the tribunal in the Hague.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Karadzic left Bosnia in November 1997
and had since been in contact with two American lawyers to
explore the possibility of surrender.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the so-called Stabilization Force (SFOR) led by
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) arrested two Bosnian
Serb war crimes suspects and flew them to custody in the Hague.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Picks Lockheed to Build New Missiles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The Pentagon on Thursday
decided to let Lockheed Martin Corp. to build its next generation
of stealthy, air-launched cruise missiles in a deal worth up to 3
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Air Force wants to build 2,400 of the satellite-guided
missiles, which pilots would launch while far from their targets.
</P>
<P>
The missiles will have a range of about 185 kilometers and hug
the terrain as they sneak past radar systems to attack enemy air
defense systems.
</P>
<P>
The Seattle-based Boeing Co. was the loser in the competition
for building the "joint air to surface standoff missile," known as
the JASSM.
</P>
<P>
The weapon will bolster "the effectiveness and the versatility"
of the Air Force's bomber fleet in the coming century, said Air
Force acting secretary F. Whitten Peters in announcing the
decision at the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said, the new missiles "are
highly advanced new weapons designed to improve the ability of our
forces to strike high priority, well defended targets from long
distances with little or no threat to U.S. airplanes launching the
missiles."
</P>
<P>
The missiles will be designed to launch from a variety of
planes, including the F-16 Fighting Falcon, the F/A-18 Hornet, the
B-52, B-1 and B-2 bombers.
</P>
<P>
The missile, while still highly classified, is expected to have
a highly angular design and small wings. It will use the satellite
global positioning system to help guide it to its target, reported
the Associated Press.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Worried Over River Projects of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican Minister for Economy
and Social Affairs in the President's Office Rneas Comiche
Thursday expressed his worry over neighboring countries' river
projects.
</P>
<P>
The Mozambican News Agency Thursday quoted Comiche as saying
at a seminar on water issue that the situation in the use of
water in Mozambique is gloomy as only one-third of the population
have access to potable water, much lower than the level in many
other African countries.
</P>
<P>
Comiche said that although Mozambique enjoys good relations
with its neighbors sharing international rivers, they continue
designing and implementing river projects without any early
consultance with or permission from the Mozambican government,
which will threaten the flow of water for Mozambicans and "
restrain our future development."
</P>
<P>
The Mozambican government should take actions to strengthen
its position in negotiations on water issues and improve water
conservancy, Comiche said, adding that the government should also
take up unified measures, build and maintain the water works, let
the existing water projects work in full capacity and adopt the
right technologies.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Public Works and Housing Robert White noted at the
seminar that the basic condition for enough water supply in terms
of both quantity and quality is that dialogs be made among the
countries concerned.
</P>
<P>
White believed that to make dialogs effective, Mozambique must
increase its own capacity, so that "we can gradually hold
discussions with our neighbors in the Southern Africa Development
Community on the basis of equality."
</P>
<P>
A strategy should be drawn for regulation on water resources,
said White.
</P>
<P>
He added that the main part of the strategy is to immediately
make sure that water be utilized more reasonably through the
mechanism of licensing and taxation.
</P>
<P>
Finally, White pointed out:"While we can not do it ourselves,
we should not demand our neighbors to take action to save water."
</P>
<P>
Mozambique is listed as the second with international rivers
in the sub-Saharan African countries, sharing nine rivers with
its neighbors.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright will take a trip late this month to Japan,
China, South Korea and Mongolia, the State Department announced on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin told reporters that
Albright's trip is to affirm U.S. strategic commitments to Asia.
</P>
<P>
She will take up such issues as the situation on the Korean
Peninsula, the Asian financial crisis and progress toward
credible elections in Cambodia and Myanmar, Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
But the main focus of the trip is to work on the agenda for a
late June summit in Beijing between Chinese President Jiang Zemin
and U.S. President Bill Clinton following last October's meeting
between the two leaders in Washington.
</P>
<P>
She will be in China on April 29 and 30 to meet Chinese
officials for the arrangement of Clinton's visit to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo on April 28, Albright is expected to reiterate
WAshington's call for more action by Japan to stimulate its
economy.
</P>
<P>
Albright will be in South Korea on May 1. It will be the first
high-level U.S. visit since South Korean President Kim Dae-jung
took office in February.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said Albright is expected to discuss with
South Korean officials a proposal by the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea to resume direct dialogue between Pyongyang
and Seoul and how those talks would affect the four-party talks
in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
Albright will be in Mongolia on May 2. Mongolia attracts U.S.
attention because of its largely untapped mineral wealth.

WASHINGTON, April 9 (Xinhua) -- A White House steward Thursday
appeared before a federal grand jury investigating an alleged
presidential affair and coverup.
</P>
<P>
The stewards often work near the president, and prosecutors for
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr apparently are interested in
what they have to say. Glen Maes testified Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Another steward, Bayani Nelvis, has previously testified. He
works in a pantry adjacent to the Oval Office and President Bill
Clinton's private study in the West Wing.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutors want to hear from anyone who might have seen
Clinton and former intern Monica Lewinsky together, as Starr
investigates whether the two had an affair and whether Clinton and
others asked her to lie about it under oath.
</P>
<P>
Clinton and Lewinsky both have denied that they had a sexual
relationship.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank announced here
Thursday the approvement of a 70 million U.S. dollar interest-free
credit to assist Nicaragua's financial sector adjustment program.
</P>
<P>
This project will support the Government's structural
adjustment program, which is designed to carry out a major reform
of the state banking sector, improve financial intermediation,
especially in rural areas, and improve the regulatory framework
for private banking.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of the reform program would enable the
Government to address major obstacles to sustainable private
sector-led growth. The problems include the longstanding threats
to fiscal stability and financial markets posed by the state
banks.
</P>
<P>
This will directly promote improved financial intermediation
with regard to the critically important rural and agricultural
sectors, and will strengthen the regulatory framework for the
financial sector.
</P>
<P>
The credit will be provided by the International Development
Association (IDA), the World Bank's concessional lending wing for
developing countries.
