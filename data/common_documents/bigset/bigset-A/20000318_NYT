RUTGERS WOMEN DEFEAT HOLY CROSS, 91-70 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk)

<TEXT>
<P>
   PISCATAWAY, N.J. _ They were smaller, slower and far less
talented. But for a half of Friday night's first-round NCAA
tournament game at the Louis Brown Athletic Center, the 15th-seeded
Crusaders of Holy Cross were more than enough for second-seeded
Rutgers.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the 3-point shooting of Anna Kinne, the Crusaders trailed
by just four points at halftime and were all smiles heading into
the locker room. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Then the Scarlet Knights wiped the smiles right off their faces
at the start of the second half. Rutgers hit eight of its first
nine shots in a 24-4 blitz and cruised to a 91-70 victory in the
West Regional. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers will meet 10th-seeded St. Joseph's, a 69-48 winner over
seventh-seeded Texas earlier, in a second-round game here Sunday
night. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Usha Gilmore led Rutgers (23-7) with 14 points and Kinne had 28
points for Holy Cross (23-7). Rutgers created some breathing room
with a 10-0 run in which the Scarlet Knights made their first five
shots of the second half to take a 51-37 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Scarlet Knights began tracking Kinne _ who had scored 19
points in the first half _ more carefully along the perimeter.
Kinne was unable to free herself and the misses began mounting for
the Crusaders. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The solution seemed so simple: Krazy Glue a player to Kinne _ in
this case Karlita Washington or Usha Gilmore _ and let Holy Cross
try to score without her. The Knights began talking to Kinne, and
Kinne was talking back. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tasha Pointer, who had been nearly a no-show in the first half,
drilled a jumper to increase the lead to 53-39 with under 15
minutes to go. Kinne slid along the baseline for a layup, but
Gilmore answered with a jump shot and then a 3-point play off a
fast break. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Scarlet Knights were bigger, faster and better. And in the
second half they were playing like it. When Stewart streaked in for
a layup, it made the lead 61-41 with 12 minutes 20 seconds left and
Rutgers was cruising, much to the relief of a partisan crowd that
included New Jersey Gov. Christie Whitman.
</P>
<P>
   Holy Cross trailed by 41-37 at halftime and was clearly enjoying
itself. Inspired by the shooting of Kinne, the Crusaders made
enough shots to keep Rutgers from picking up the pace. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers outrebounded Holy Cross by 21-10, and shot 56 percent to
Holy Cross' 52 percent, in the first half. Holy Cross had seven
turnovers to Rutgers' five, but Kinne's 6-of-7 shooting from
3-point range and an inside push for nine points from Jeanette
Paukert kept the Crusaders in the game. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Holy Cross won the Patriot League's regular season and
tournament championships. Of its six losses, three were to Top 20
teams and three were without Kinne, the league's player of the
year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Crusaders were shorter, slower and less talented. In an
agonizing first half for the Scarlet Knights, it nearly didn't
matter. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   St. Joseph's 69, Texas 48
</P>
<P>
   St. Joseph's forward Susan Moran, a member of the Irish national
team, scored a game-high 24 points in her first time playing on St.
Patrick's Day. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't the luck of the Irish that we're here,'' Moran said.
``And it isn't the luck of the Irish that we won.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tenth-seeded St. Joseph's (25-5), which had allowed an average
of just 53 points a game, limited the seventh-seeded Longhorns
(21-13) and their star, Edwina Brown (14 points), to just one field
goal in nearly 11 minutes while extending its 32-30 halftime lead
to 52-40.

SHIFTING VIEW TOWARD POLICE COMPLICATES DECISION TO TESTIFY 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also NY-POLICE-SHOOTING, NY-POLICE-TRAINING) 
(js) 
 By DAVID ROHDE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The undercover police detective who fired the shot
that killed an unarmed man in Midtown Manhattan on Thursday faces a
pivotal decision: Should he volunteer to testify before the grand
jury investigating the shooting?
</P>
<P>
   The facts are still sketchy and under investigation, and it is
unknown whether the panel of 23 New Yorkers will have grounds to
charge the detective, Anthony Vasquez, with a crime. But after a
spate of high-profile shootings and cases of police misconduct,
defense experts say he should carefully weigh his next move.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, in most police shootings, officers chose to take
the witness stand to explain their use of deadly force, police
union lawyers said. And grand juries _ which decide whether there
is enough evidence for an indictment _ generally gave the officers'
accounts the benefit of the doubt.
</P>
<P>
   But several legal experts and leading criminal defense lawyers
said Friday that Vasquez should not testify before the grand jury
because the reputation of the New York Police Department has been
damaged so much in recent months that grand jurors may not believe
his testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a different era, the police officers carried with them a
strong presumption of integrity,'' said Gerald Shargel, a Manhattan
defense lawyer. ``But unfortunately, because of the conduct of a
few, that has evaporated.''
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts attribute that change in part to two high-profile
cases with racial overtones: the fatal shooting of Amadou Diallo,
an unarmed black man, by four white police officers, and the
torture of another black man, Abner Louima, in a Brooklyn police
station. In both cases, the accused officers decided not to testify
before grand juries. The Louima case led to convictions in two
trials; the officers in the Diallo case were acquitted last month.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of those cases has spilled into grand jury rooms. The
proceedings are secret, but prosecutors have reported that in
recent months, jurors appear to have become increasingly skeptical
of police testimony, and that they have become increasingly
aggressive in asking all witnesses more questions. For example,
they have asked police officers to explain their conduct in greater
detail, for example, where there were questions about whether
arrests or seizures were proper.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been more probing,'' said one lawyer who recently
watched police officers testify before grand juries and who spoke
on the condition of anonymity. ``It's question after question after
question.''
</P>
<P>
   Several legal experts said it may be wiser for Vasquez not to
appear before the grand jury, even if he broke no law in shooting
Patrick M. Dorismond, 26, an unarmed black man, after scuffling
with him outside a bar.
</P>
<P>
   If the grand jurors believe civilian witnesses over Vasquez and
indict him, the experts pointed out, then the detective's
statements to the grand jury could be used against him at a trial.
But not testifying carries a risk: if Vasquez does not tell his
side, he may be indicted on manslaughter or criminally negligent
homicide charges for his actions, creating yet another racially
charged police abuse trial in the city.
</P>
<P>
   The officer's lawyer, Philip Karasyk, said Vasquez would not
comment on whether he would testify.
</P>
<P>
   Karasyk said Dorismond was the aggressor in the brief, chaotic
encounter. He attacked one of Vasquez's undercover partners, who
had approached him and asked if he sold drugs, Karasyk said. The
lawyer said that after Vasquez identified himself twice as a police
officer and drew his gun, Dorismond lunged and hit the detective's
gun hand, causing the weapon to fire.
</P>
<P>
   Undercover detectives typically back away from fights, Karasyk
added. ``They are not looking for confrontation. The last thing
they want to have happen is for there to be a fight where their
cover can be blown.''
</P>
<P>
   Exactly what the evidence will show was unclear Friday.
Prosecutors refused to discuss their investigation or the results
of forensic tests. But potential strategies for both sides emerged
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts said relevant forensic evidence might include the
victim's blood alcohol level and the results of tests for gunpowder
traces on Dorismond's sleeve or hand, which would suggest they were
near the gun when it fired.
</P>
<P>
   Several witnesses have sharply contradicted the version of
events presented by the detective's lawyer. Kevin Kaiser, a friend
and fellow security guard who was drinking with Dorismond before
the shooting, said that after Dorismond angrily answered the
undercover officer's question about drugs, an officer swung first.
Kaiser and other witnesses also said the officers, who were in
plain clothes, never identified themselves as the police.
</P>
<P>
   Based on these statements, said James Cohen, a professor at
Fordham University Law school, prosecutors could argue that the
police were criminally reckless during the encounter for
approaching Dorismond for no apparent reason, being confrontational
and quickly drawing and firing a weapon without justification.
``They stopped these people on the street. The people say, `Get
lost.' The thing escalates, and in an instant, the nondrug dealer
gets killed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Hayes, a prominent Manhattan defense lawyer, was the only
expert interviewed Friday who said he thought Vasquez should tell
his story to the grand jury. He said officers need to speak out
more and said the real issues are whether the police have
sufficient training and whether aggressive tactics cause dangerous
confrontations.
</P>
<P>
   He said city officials or the police need to reach out to the
community. ``If the mayor won't do it, the police union should do
it, because otherwise, it's going to be impossible to be a police
officer.'' &QL;

GOVERNOR'S AIDE FINED FOR GIFTS FROM TOBACCO LOBBY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ A top aide to Gov. George Pataki on Friday became
the first state official to be punished for accepting gifts from a
tobacco industry lobbyist, in violation of state law, agreeing to
pay a $2,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   The aide, James G. Natoli, paid the fine to settle a case
brought by the State Ethics Commission, for accepting meals and
other gifts worth more than $75, the state threshold. The gifts to
Natoli, the director of state operations, were from Sharon Portnoy,
the chief New York lobbyist for Philip Morris Cos., the world's
largest cigarette maker. It is the largest fine paid to the
commission in five years.
</P>
<P>
   But Natoli's penalty highlights the fact that scores of state
legislators who accepted gifts from Portnoy _ some of them far in
excess of what Natoli took _ have not been penalized. While the
Ethics Commission polices violations of the gift law by members of
the executive branch, the Legislative Ethics Committee enforces it
for the legislative branch.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the Legislature polices itself. Officials say
that in its 11-year history, the Legislative Ethics Committee has
never penalized a legislator for violating the $75 gift rule, which
it interprets less rigidly, and so far, it has not signaled that it
will look into the Philip Morris gifts.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times first reported almost eight months ago that
Portnoy and Philip Morris had treated more than 100 current and
former legislators, along with numerous aides and other officials,
to meals and other gifts, but had failed to report them to the
State Lobbying Commission, as required by law. Many of the gifts
violated the state's $75 limit.
</P>
<P>
   The Lobbying Commission fined Philip Morris $75,000, the largest
penalty in commission history, and fined Portnoy $15,000 and barred
her from lobbying for three years.
</P>
<P>
   The affair proved deeply embarrassing to legislators, and
prompted them to strengthen the state's lobbying law in December.
</P>
<P>
   The State Ethics Commission is looking into the financing of
Pataki's trips to Hungary in 1995 and 1996, which were sponsored by
a small Hungarian-American group, at about the time the group
received donations from Philip Morris and other corporations with
interests before the state.
</P>
<P>
   Under the state Public Officers Law, it is illegal to give a
gift worth more than $75 to a state official _ and for the official
to accept such a gift _ if that gift could reasonably be
interpreted as being meant to influence state policy. The Ethics
Commission interprets that as being $75 per year, all gifts
combined, while the Legislature interprets it as $75 per gift, with
an unlimited number of gifts possible each year.
</P>
<P>
   According to Philip Morris records and the Ethics Commission,
Portnoy paid for four meals at restaurants for Natoli and his wife,
with other relatives included at one, from 1996 through last year.
All four meals topped $75, and the total was $664.90. In addition,
Portnoy paid Natoli's and his wife's way to an auto race in
Pennsylvania in 1998 and paid their admission, for a total value of
$199.47.
</P>
<P>
   Natoli has said that Portnoy is a longtime friend, and that he
did not consider the events to have been business-related.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was disappointed when I learned that Portnoy reported these
dinners as business expenses, and moved immediately to reimburse
her company,'' he said in a statement Friday. ``Nevertheless, I
have decided to resolve this matter quickly because of my strong
belief that the taxpayers must have confidence in their public
servants.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ethics Commission began its investigation into Natoli based
on a complaint filed by the New York Public Interest Research
Group, Common Cause and the League of Women Voters. On Friday,
Blair Horner, legislative director of the research group, said that
because the commission made little about its investigation and
findings public, he did not know whether to be satisfied with the
outcome.
</P>
<P>
   The Ethics Commission has the power to refer the investigation
to a prosecutor for action against Philip Morris, but said it had
chosen not to, though a commission official said that remained a
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   As for any action against the legislators, the staff of the
Legislative Ethics Committee and the legislators who lead it, Sen.
John Marchi, R-Staten Island, and Assemblywoman Deborah Glick,
D-Manhattan, refused to say whether the committee was looking into
the Philip Morris gifts to lawmakers. But several of the
legislators who received the gifts have said that they are not
under investigation, and did not expect an inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The signal from the Legislative Ethics Committee is that you
can break the law and get away with it,'' Horner said. ``It's a
green light to corruption. There's no cop working this beat.''

NEW JERSEY RELEASES PAYMENTS TO CAR INSPECTORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   New Jersey officials said Friday that the company hired to run
the state's new automobile inspection system had significantly
reduced the long waits, and would therefore receive $5.5 million
that had been withheld by the state.
</P>
<P>
   Transportation officials said that waiting times at the 32
inspection stations run by the company had averaged 11 minutes this
month, down from 25 minutes in January. As a result, the state
released the money it had withheld from the company, Parsons
Infrastructure and Technology Group of Pasadena, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   James Weinstein, the state transportation commissioner, and C.
Richard Kamin, director of the state Division of Motor Vehicles,
said that steps taken by Parsons included increasing its total
number of employees to 825 from 560 and doubling the hours of
training each employee receives, to 80.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all of those areas, we are making significant progress,''
Weinstein said during the first of what is to be a series of
briefings on the inspection system.
</P>
<P>
   The steps were outlined by Parsons in a report ordered by Gov.
Christie Whitman last month, when she withheld nearly $11 million
from Parsons because of the system's problems. The $5.5 million
released Friday was part of that.
</P>
<P>
   But with 15 of the 32 testing stations still using an older,
less stringent emissions test as a temporary means of reducing
waiting times, Assemblyman Neil Cohen, D-Elizabeth, criticized the
release of the money as premature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should we pay them any more money?'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Dana Sullivan, a spokesman for the Division of Motor Vehicles,
said the partial payment was a response to the progress Parsons had
made.
</P>
<P>
   The inspection system has been a recurring source of
embarrassment to Whitman's administration, which awarded a $463
million contract to Parsons, the lone bidder, in 1998. Three state
investigations related to the contract are pending.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the governor ordered that the 15 busiest stations
revert to the less stringent, faster emissions test. The move was
approved by the federal Environmental Protection Agency, which
enforces the clean-air standards that the new test is intended to
help meet. The newer, more stringent test is to be phased back in
by June 30.
</P>
<P>
   But the move to the faster test infuriated owners of 1,400
private service stations, who do inspections for a fee of up to
$75, and who each invested about $50,000 in new testing equipment.
The owners said that allowing drivers to take the less stringent
test at state inspection stations discouraged use of the private
service stations.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey Gasoline Retailers Association, which represents
the service stations, has prepared a lawsuit that it planned to
filed Friday in U.S. District Court in Newark, charging the state
and the EPA with violating the federal Clean Air Act.
</P>
<P>
   But William Dressler, the group's executive director, said he
had agreed to hold off on the lawsuit after Weinstein promised to
negotiate a compromise. Dressler said he was likely to meet with
state officials on Wednesday.

HOLLOWAY'S FULL-COURT ZIP LIFTS SETON HALL OVER OREGON, 72-71 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ Give a team the basketball with almost nine
seconds remaining in overtime and there are a lot of offensive
options a coach can order up.
</P>
<P>
   He can direct his players to work it to a big man underneath. Or
a guard can shoot a jump shot from outside. There is time to pass
and screen and post up, too.
</P>
<P>
   Or a team can simply do what coach Tommy Amaker's Seton Hall
Pirates did Friday in their exhilarating victory over Oregon in the
first round of the NCAA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing by one point, Shaheen Holloway took the inbounds pass
at one end of the court, dribbled through double coverage, shook
another Ducks defender as he raced down the floor and banked a
layup off the glass of the backboard, down through the hoop and out
the net to give the Pirates a 72-71 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``No way I was going to give the ball up,'' Holloway, a senior
guard finally playing in the NCAA tournament, said. ``Growing up as
a little kid, you watch the NCAA tournament and see people doing
stuff like this. And you say to yourself, `One day, I want to be a
part of that.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ducks coach Ernie Kent said: ``He made a great spin dribble at
the top of the key and hit an off-balance runner. Not a lot you can
do.''
</P>
<P>
   This was a memorable moment, ending a game that was occasionally
as ragged as it was exciting, the kind of climactic play in the
clutch that will be replayed on videotape for the rest of this
tournament and probably for years to come. And it elevated 21-9
Seton Hall, the 10th-seeded team in the East, to at least Game 2 of
what it hopes will be an extended adventure. The Pirates will play
Sunday against Temple, which defeated Lafayette by 73-47 Friday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Amaker and Holloway both said there were other options off Seton
Hall's winning play, but the coach added: ``We want the ball in his
hands. He always has the option to use his instincts to make a
play, to create on the fly.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than two minutes before, Holloway had lost the ball on a
play that gave Oregon the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt devastated,'' Holloway said, quickly adding that he got
over it right away because he knew he was going to get the ball
back and get another chance.
</P>
<P>
   He finished with 27 points, the most of anyone in the game, and
was 3 for 3 from 3-point range. Rimas Kaukenas and Darius Lane each
scored 14. Two of Kaukenas' points came with 3.3 seconds remaining
in regulation when he tied the score at 64-64 on a driving layup to
send the game into overtime. Also contributing for Seton Hall was
Samuel Dalembert, the 7-foot-1-inch freshman center who began the
game with two blocked shots and finished the game with six of them
to go with 12 rebounds and six points.
</P>
<P>
   Kaukenas, like Holloway, has played four years at Seton Hall,
gradually helping to build a program that is making its first NCAA
tournament appearance since 1994. Kaukenas knows Holloway as well
as anyone and was asked if he expected the final play to conclude
as it did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, probably,'' Kaukenas said, smiling. ``That's how I
expected it to end up. It was real exciting. I knew it would be a
happy ending.''
</P>
<P>
   But not for the Ducks, who finished their season with a 22-8
record after coming into the game seeded No. 7. A.D. Smith scored
17 points for Oregon and Alex Scales added 16. Oregon's players,
having traveled from the West Coast, began the game at what
amounted to 9:30 a.m. for them, although the Ducks had three days
to adjust after arriving. Seton Hall led by as many as 9 points in
the first half, but the margin dwindled to a point at intermission
and the Ducks led by two early in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates came back to lead by 10 with less than seven minutes
remaining, but lost the lead when the Ducks went on a 13-2 surge in
a five-minute span to take a 60-59 advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We probably got too excited,'' Kaukenas said. ``That's why we
wasted the lead.''
</P>
<P>
   With 12.7 seconds remaining in regulation, Bryan Bracey sank two
free throws to give Oregon a 64-62 lead before Kaukenas surprised
the Ducks by driving the lane to tie the score. In overtime, there
were seven lead changes. Frederick Jones sank two free throws to
give the Ducks a 71-70 lead _ their final lead _ with 8.7 seconds
left.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Holloway's clincher, leaving Oregon stunned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your stomach kind of sinks, just like on a roller coaster,''
the Ducks' Darius Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, there are no emotions,'' said Kent, the Ducks' coach.
``There is more of a calm. This was a terrific experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Temple, seeded No. 2 in the region, improved its record to 27-5
by taking a 38-20 lead at halftime and cruising. Quincy Wadley
scored 17 points, Mark Karcher had 15 and Kevin Lyde 12. Ronald
Rollerson had 10 rebounds in 15 minutes. Tyson Whitfield led
Lafayette (24-7) with 15 points.

   NEW YORK _ If history is any guide, Thursday's powerful
499-point gain in the Dow Jones industrial average augurs good news
for investors for the next few months.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, past performance is no guarantee of future success,
as many a mutual fund advertisement has noted. But the statistics
are unambiguous.
</P>
<P>
   Before this week, the Dow, which gained 4.9 percent Thursday,
had rallied 4 percent or more 10 times since the current bull
market began in 1982. On eight of those occasions, stocks extended
their gains for at least three months after the big one-day move,
according to Richard McCabe, chief market strategist at Merrill
Lynch. And the gains were substantial. Even factoring in the two
times the Dow did not continue to rally, the index averaged a 7.5
percent gain over the three months after the end of its big day.
</P>
<P>
   Over a longer period, the positive results are even more
pronounced, according to a study by Birinyi Associates. Including
Thursday, Birinyi looked at the Dow's 25 best days since 1970, a
period that covers both bull and bear markets. The firm found they
presaged a gain of more than 14 percent over the next six months.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the last move is showing is that investors have not
abandoned stocks,'' said Robin Griffiths, the chief technical
analyst at HSBC Securities. ``This is greed rather than fear, and
as long as we have greed around, we have a bull market.''
</P>
<P>
   After Thursday's big gains, the Dow pulled back slightly Friday,
falling 35.37 points, to 10,595.23, a 0.33 percent drop. The Nasdaq
composite index rose 80.74 points, or 1.71 percent, to 4,798.13,
while the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index gained 6 points, or
0.41 percent, to 1,464.47.
</P>
<P>
   Despite history's promise of further gains, Wall Street's
technical analysts said that this week's rally may be an exception
to the rule.
</P>
<P>
   These technicians earn their keep by trying to divine the future
moves of stocks from their price histories. To the large group of
investors and economists who believe that stocks are impossible to
predict that way, technicians are little more than psychics with
computers. But nearly every major Wall Street firm keeps at least a
couple of technical analysts on staff.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to price movements, technicians generally look for a
rally with heavy trading and breadth, meaning several stocks rise
for each stock that falls. Thursday's move seems to fit all three
categories. Almost 1.5 billion shares were traded on the New York
Stock Exchange, an all-time record, and seven stocks rose for every
two that dropped on the Big Board.
</P>
<P>
   Rallies like Thursday's ``have tended to mean that the market
will go up for a number of weeks and in many cases a number of
months,'' said Ricky Harrington, technical analyst for Wachovia
Securities in North Carolina. But Harrington said he remained
``very cautious about this market,'' in part because the Dow
remains below its average of the last 200 days, a trend technicians
view as bearish.
</P>
<P>
   McCabe is also uncertain that Thursday's gains will hold, though
for a different reason. He is worried that investors are overly
bullish. It may sound counterintuitive, but technical analysts say
that the strongest rallies begin when most investors have turned
very negative and selling pressure has reached a climax. Recent
surveys show that investors are very complacent, as opposed to
negative, about the market, McCabe said. He fears that stocks will
turn down again ``sometime in the spring.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Dickey, managing director for technical analysis at Dain
Rauscher, said he expected stocks to remain in a tight range over
the next several months and finish the year not far from their
current levels. Slipping a bit of fundamental analysis into his
explanation, Dickey said, ``We're in a period of rising interest
rates similar to 1994, and so I think this year will be similar to
1994,'' a year most stocks ended slightly down.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, ``Don't fight the Fed'' is one of Wall Street's
hoariest maxims, and Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan has
repeatedly indicated his discomfort with the level of stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   But though the Fed has raised short-term interest rates four
times since June in an effort to slow the U.S. economy, corporate
profits continue to chug along. They are expected to rise 17.7
percent this year, following a rise of 18 percent last year,
according to First Call/Thomson Financial. Long-term interest rates
have also dropped substantially since hitting highs in January.
Lower interest rates are good for stocks, because they lessen the
cost of corporate borrowing while making bonds less attractive as
an investment alternative.
</P>
<P>
   In the bond market, the price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose
18/32 Friday, to 103 14/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the
opposite direction from the price, fell to 6.00 percent from 6.04
percent on Thursday.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ There have been years when Mayor Rudolph Giuliani had
the political stage of the St. Patrick's Day parade in New York
City virtually to himself. Not Friday. For the first time, Giuliani
had to share Fifth Avenue with the woman who has inserted herself
into his political life, Hillary Rodham Clinton _ but who was booed
more than cheered as she strode up the center of Manhattan in a
mid-March snowstorm.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Clinton waved happily to the crowds and announced shortly
before the bagpipes started that ``it is just a great pleasure to
be here as a New Yorker.''
</P>
<P>
   To which the mayor almost immediately retorted: `Oh my goodness!
That's interesting. That's interesting! I hope she knows the way. I
hope she doesn't get lost on one of the side streets.''
</P>
<P>
   The St. Patrick's Day parade has always been a must stop for
candidates on New York's political circuit, but Friday it turned
into the Rudy and Hillary show as the two contenders for the U.S.
Senate marched in separate contingents on a raw day that turned the
knees of bare-legged majorettes bright red. They also held dueling
news conferences on Fifth Avenue, one block and 15 minutes apart,
and sat several pews apart in St. Patrick's Cathedral at the same
Mass, without the ailing Cardinal John O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal's absence dampened the parade _ ``I felt terrible
about the cardinal not being there,'' the mayor said _ as did
weather that reduced the crowd in kilts, Irish knit sweaters and
green hair to only one or two deep as the procession reached 86th
Street, the end of the route. But the stalwarts were there, among
them Mary Clifford, a 59-year-old statistical analyst at IBM, who
has been standing on the same corner of Fifth Avenue and 86th
Street on St. Patrick's Day for the last 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I used to watch the parade downtown near 59th Street,
there were too many drunks, so I came up here and I've been
standing here ever since,'' said Clifford, of Little Falls, N.J.
``Every year it's special because being Irish is more than green
beer and green bagels; it's this parade. The parade is a
manifestation of our pride in our heritage.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the two Senate candidates provided a new focus this year,
even though they never got close to each other. But they did speak
through sound bites relayed by reporters in the moving scrimmages
following them up Fifth Avenue. ``Maybe I can show her the way to
Chappaqua,'' Giuliani cracked.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's press contingent was bigger than the mayor's, but so
were her jeers. Many came from freezing watchers who shouted out
for her to ``Go home!'' even though a number were themselves not
from New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go back to Arkansas!'' yelled Patrick Bermingham, a cemetery
groundskeeper from North Arlington, N.J., as Clinton clambered into
her waiting black van at the end of the parade route at 86th Street
and Madison Avenue. Outside the Plaza Hotel, a small group of gay
protesters shouted ``Shame! Shame!'' as Clinton passed, angry at
her participation in a parade that bars an organization of gay and
lesbian Irish-Americans from marching under their own banner.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, dressed in a black raincoat and a sea-green scarf at
her neck, smiled cheerfully back as supporters marching with her
yelled out ``We love Hillary!'' to drown out the jeers.
</P>
<P>
   One of those with the first lady was former Mayor Edward I.
Koch, who pronounced the Irish ``a lovely, gracious and supportive
people,'' said that the boos ``test her mettle'' and called
Giuliani ``bush league'' and ``a doofus'' for making fun of the
first lady's ability to navigate New York's streets. Others in
Clinton's entourage included a large group of Secret Service agents
_ more than the usual _ who constantly looked up at the spectators
watching from the buildings lining one of New York's busiest
streets.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of Irish-Americans and Irish fans clearly belonged to
the mayor, although many of them were also from out of town. ``Oh
my God!'' said a thrilled Amy Converse, a 27-year-old Montessori
teacher from West Palm Beach, Fla., who was standing at 47th Street
and Fifth Avenue when the mayor ran over to greet people on the
sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love what he's done for the city,'' Converse added. ``It's
my first time here, and I feel very safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, dressed in a green vest, green tie and green baseball
cap, began marching near the start of the parade around 11 a.m.
with a contingent of New York City Police officers, whom he
vigorously defended the shooting of an unarmed black man during a
scuffle with detectives in Manhattan early Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``You really have to give the police a break,'' the mayor said
to reporters at his news briefing on Fifth Avenue at 44th Street,
before the parade. ``These are men and women that are out there
protecting us.'' He added, ``Let's give them at least the benefit
that most of you usually give common criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who spoke minutes later at her own news conference on
Fifth Avenue at 43rd Street, was more measured. ``I would think all
of us are concerned about another police shooting, and we'll wait
to see the investigation and results of that investigation,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton defended her participation in a parade that excludes the
Irish Lesbian and Gay Organization. ``When you're in public life,
you have to balance a lot of different values, and today we're
marching on behalf of Irish-Americans and in favor of the peace
process,'' she said. But she also said that ``I would hope that
this parade would become inclusive'' and ``I will certainly speak
out for that.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   After Clinton finished marching, she went back to the White
House for a reception with Irish leaders, including Prime Minister
Bertie Ahern and Gerry Adams, the president of Sinn Fein, who were
in Washington for Northern Ireland peace settlement talks. When
Giuliani finished marching, he remarched the route, as he usually
does, three more times, with contingents from the Fire Department,
the sanitation workers and his alma mater, Manhattan College.

PETROLEUM PRICES PUSH CONSUMER PRICE INDEX TO A 3-YEAR HIGH 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to change Consumer Price Index to inflation rate in lede
graf.)  
(mk) 
 By LOUIS UCHITELLE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Surging petroleum prices pushed the inflation rate in February
to its highest level in three years, the Labor Department reported
Friday. But beyond fuel and energy, the nation remained remarkably
free of the rising inflation that the booming economy was expected
to have produced by now.
</P>
<P>
   The Consumer Price Index, the nation's best-known inflation
gauge, has risen by 3.2 percent over the last 12 months, the first
time the yearlong rate had gone above 3 percent since February
1997. But with energy excluded, the annual rate was only 2.1
percent, unchanged for many months, although some economists had
expected a much greater impact from labor shortages and rising
wages.
</P>
<P>
   The inflation rate remained at 2.1 percent when food was
excluded as well as energy. Prices in these sectors often jump
around from month to month, so economists subtract them to get a
``core'' inflation rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a certain bizarre way, life would be easier for Alan
Greenspan and the Federal Reserve if there had been a bad CPI,''
said Robert Barbera, chief economist for Hoenig Group. ``They could
then have dealt with their real problem, an excessively high stock
market, and blamed their actions on inflation in goods and
services.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's policy-makers are expected to raise interest rates
when they meet on Tuesday, but not by enough to inhibit stock
market investors, many analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   Most of last month's increase of 0.5 percent _ the largest
one-month rise since last April _ reflected the runup in petroleum
prices. Gasoline at the pump averaged $1.42 a gallon, up from $1.36
in January. Airline fares rose as airlines tacked on surcharges to
cover higher fuel prices. And the cost of running a home rose,
reflecting higher prices for heating oil and natural gas, whose
price fluctuates with that of petroleum.
</P>
<P>
   Natural gas is widely used to generate electricity, and
electricity rates jumped by 0.8 percent in February, the biggest
increase since July 1997. So far, however, the rise in petroleum
and natural gas prices has not spread to other products, like
plastics, which are made from oil or natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   Toy prices, for example, did not rise, and vehicle prices,
adjusted for quality improvements, fell last month, the Bureau of
Labor Statistics reported. Even truckers have not managed to jack
up freight rates, although the squeeze on their earnings from
higher fuel prices has truckers protesting in Washington for
relief.
</P>
<P>
   That will change, says Chris Varvares, a partner at
Macroeconomic Advisers LLC in St. Louis, if the petroleum-producing
countries somehow manage to make the oil price increases stick.
</P>
<P>
   ``If companies expect the increase to be temporary, they will
eat the cost and squeeze profit margins temporarily,'' he said.
``But if energy prices stay high, firms will try to restore their
profits by raising prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond energy, there were scattered price increases, in
cigarettes, for example, and hospital rates. Meat and pork prices
rose by 1.7 percent, which is more than usual, and such increases
may repeat themselves because of a supply shortage, said Patrick
Jackman, a senior economist in the consumer price division at the
Bureau of Labor Statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Fruit and vegetable prices also rose last month, but the 0.7
percent increase mainly reflected an aberration in the way prices
are adjusted for seasonal factors, Jackman said.
</P>
<P>
   And some prices fell in February. Vehicle prices dropped by 0.1
percent after a 0.3 percent drop in January. Long-distance
telephone rates also fell, along with the cost of purchasing and
using a cell phone.

RICHARD HODGSON, 83, SILICON VALLEY PIONEER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Mass., N.Y., Conn., Colo., Canada)  (lb) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Richard Hodgson, an engineer and executive who did early
development work in radar and television and played a role in the
events that led to the creation of Silicon Valley, died on March 4
in Barbados. He was 83.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was injuries from an automobile accident, a daughter,
Brooke D. Hodgson, said.
</P>
<P>
   While an executive vice president at Fairchild Camera and
Instrument Corp., Hodgson oversaw the creation of the company's
semiconductor division in 1957, when a group of scientists and
engineers who had left Shockley Semiconductor approached Fairchild
for financial backing.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman Fairchild, the company's founder, met with the group,
which had already approached 30 companies. He told Hodgson to
establish Fairchild Semiconductor as a division based in Mountain
View, Calif. Hodgson, who had held engineering positions in radar,
nuclear reactors and television displays, would oversee the new
division.
</P>
<P>
   Fairchild Semiconductor pioneered the semiconductor integrated
circuit, a crucial component in early government weapons and space
programs. Semiconductors were later to become the crucial component
of computers and industrial systems.
</P>
<P>
   Hodgson was born in a mining camp in Anyox, British Columbia, on
Jan. 7, 1917. He studied mechanical engineering at Stanford
University, graduating in 1937, and received a master's in business
administration from Harvard in 1939.
</P>
<P>
   He went to work for Standard Oil Co. of California as a refinery
engineer, and in 1941 began work as an aircraft design engineer at
Lockheed. Two years later he became a research engineer at the
radiation laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
where he helped develop airborne and ground microwave radar
systems.
</P>
<P>
   In 1946 he became director of engineering management on designs
for nuclear reactors and instrument systems for the Atomic Energy
Commission in Brookhaven, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   In 1947 a television laboratory company that he founded did work
that led to technology for the Trinitron color TV monitor, which
was licensed to Sony Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Hodgson later became chief executive at Fairchild. It was his
departure that served as an impetus to Robert Noyce and Gordon
Moore to also leave and found Intel Corp. Hodgson became an
original investor in Intel and soon joined its board. ``He was a
phenomenal director,'' Moore remarked. ``If we had listened to him,
we never would have entered the consumer digital watch business.''
Intel briefly entered the watch business, withdrawing with large
losses.
</P>
<P>
   From 1950 to 1968, Hodgson held a range of positions at
Fairchild Camera and Instrument, tutoring the eight original
founders of Fairchild Semiconductor in business skills.
</P>
<P>
   From 1968 to 1980, he worked for ITT Corp., where he became a
senior vice president.
</P>
<P>
   A longtime resident of New Canaan, Conn., he was active in local
politics, serving two terms as head of the Democratic Town
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his daughter Brooke, he is survived by his wife,
Geraldine Reed Hodgson, of New Canaan; two sons, Philip of Aspen,
Colo., and Peter of Westport, Conn.; and another daughter, Morgan
D. Hodgson, of Washington.

LAKERS MAKE A STATEMENT WITH VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN HILLS, Mich. -- Twenty-four hours after a streak-busting,
milestone-crushing loss, the Lakers' team psyche looked pretty darn
healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Laughter on the bench? Check.
</P>
<P>
   A.C. Green playing with his green teddy bear in the fourth
quarter? Check.
</P>
<P>
   John Salley getting the nod to play garbage time in front of his
former home crowd? Check.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the final buzzer sounded Friday night, the only
concerned expression belonged to Shaquille O'Neal, searching for a
missing button on his polo shirt in the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   What, they worry?
</P>
<P>
   Not now, after the Lakers crushed the Detroit Pistons 110-82 at
the Palace of Auburn Hills, erasing any sting of the loss at
Washington the night before. The 19-game streak is gone, but the
Lakers made it a point to come back strong, winning for the 20th
time in 21 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to let too many get away from you like it did
last night,'' said Glen Rice. ``We came out and we tried to make a
statement... `OK, we had a good streak going and in no way are we
going to have too much slippage after our loss.' We wanted to show
that, hey this team is ready. We've got a lot of character, we've
matured a great deal, and we wanted to come in and bounce back. And
we did.''
</P>
<P>
   They did so with ease, after laboring through two wins and a
loss to start the week.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal's 19 second-quarter points staked them to a
double-digit advantage by halftime, and the misfiring Pistons never
made it interesting.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers found their grounding in the usual places -- stubborn
defense that held Detroit to 35.3 percent shooting and big
contributions from O'Neal (35 points, 11 rebounds), Glen Rice (19
points) and Kobe Bryant (25 points, eight rebounds, six assists).
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't entirely surprising -- the Lakers' win gave them an
18-1 record on the second night of back-to-back sets.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the most part, I thought we carried the type of game that
we wanted, kept the pace of the game the way we wanted it, got the
ball into Shaquille and worked our offense the way we felt it was
necessary to work it,'' coach Phil Jackson said. ``Detroit's a team
that plays in fits and spurts and we were able to keep their spurts
down to a minimum.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were giving up (103.8) points a game for the last four
games, and this game, I told them, I don't expect them perhaps to
keep them under 100 points, but defense has to be our mainstay.
That's what we win on, and that's how we do it. And we got that
idea back.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Harper kept Jerry Stackhouse in check early, and he finished
just 4 for 16 from the field for 18 points. Grant Hill, defended
alternately by Rice, Rick Fox and Kobe Bryant, was a nonfactor,
finishing with 12 points on 5-of-12 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just wanted to come in tonight, keep the game at our pace,
and not let their two superstars get off. We did that,'' O'Neal
said. ``(Defense) was a lot better. We had a disappointing loss
last night. We didn't want to make it two in a row.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither did Bryant, who scored a season-low seven points at
Washington, but came back strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so many games in the NBA, you can't just labor on one
game,'' he said. ``You just learn from it. I had a nice little
session with Tex (assistant coach Tex Winter) today. ... He was
just talking about the overall rhythm of the game. Usually when
things like that happen, it's nothing individual, it's the overall
rhythm that you have to kind of adjust to.''
</P>
<P>
   By late in the fourth, the game out of hand, the few thousand
fans left got something to cheer for when Jackson sent John
``Spider'' Salley, a member of two Pistons championships, into the
game. He got a warm reception, and six points on free throws.

GUN MAKER'S DECISION ON SAFETY GETS MIXED REACTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (CORRECTS in ``11'' to ``15'' in 3rd graf) 
 (With GUNS-SMITH) 
(lb)

<P>
   Smith &AMP; Wesson's decision to adopt gun-safety measures in order
to settle lawsuits brought by state and federal agencies has set
off criticism within the gun industry and a debate among
handgun-control advocates.
</P>
<P>
   To many other gun manufacturers, the decision by the United
States' largest gunmaker was seen as a betrayal that would only
alienate customers and could make Smith &AMP; Wesson an industry
outcast.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, gun-control advocates were mixed in their
views. Some said that the agreement, which ends litigation against
the company brought by the federal government and 15 cities, was an
important first step toward ending gun violence. Others said the
agreement was filled with loopholes that Smith &AMP; Wesson could
easily exploit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that a fair number of Smith &AMP; Wesson customers will no
longer want to purchase their products because of this agreement,
and they will lose market share,'' said Jeff Reh, general counsel
at Beretta USA Corp., a gunmaker based in Accokeek, Md. ``A lot of
gun owners will see this agreement as a betrayal of their Second
Amendment rights and a capitulation to the Clinton administration
gun-control agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, many in the industry, as well as some of the cities
that brought suit against Smith &AMP; Wesson and that were not part of
the agreement, were taken by surprise. Lawsuits have been brought
against a number of gun manufacturers by 28 cities and counties to
hold them responsible for the damage done by their products and to
improve gun safety. Discussions between the two sides to resolve
the lawsuits have been under way since late last year.
</P>
<P>
   Among those sharply critical of the settlement was the National
Shooting Sports Foundation, the gun-industry trade group. In a
statement, the foundation said: ``The decision by foreign-owned
handgun manufacturer Smith &AMP; Wesson to forge an agreement with the
most anti-gun administration in our nation's history has violated a
trust with their customers and with the entire firearms industry.''
</P>
<P>
   The foundation also said Smith &AMP; Wesson had taken ``initiatives
that have been discussed in confidential industry talks and run off
and cut their own deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert T. Delfay, chief executive of the foundation, said he
believed that no other gun manufacturer would follow Smith &AMP;
Wesson's lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smart gun companies have said that making a deal with a
half-dozen cities won't save my hide one bit,'' Delfay said in an
interview. ``And it could even exacerbate the situation. So that's
why I don't believe you will see other companies signing on or
striking other independent deals.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that even if gunmakers like Smith &AMP; Wesson settled some
lawsuits, ``hundreds more could come down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why the industry is interested in a unified national
solution,'' he said, ``not a piecemeal solution, like this is.''
</P>
<P>
   Gun-control advocates had mixed views on the agreement's impact.
Stephen P. Teret, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun
Policy and Research, said that ``for the first time the gun
industry has admitted it has the capacity to do much better in the
design and distribution of guns'' and that in doing so, ``it
undercuts the industry argument traditionally used in litigation,
which has always been that these things are impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   But Teret said it was unclear whether other manufacturers would
follow. ``Some manufacturers will be scrambling to get in on the
deal,'' he said. ``Others, because of the macho culture of the
industry, will try to tough it out, and they will suffer severe
punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   Kristen Rand, director of federal policy at the Violence Policy
Center, a gun-control advocacy group, predicted that Smith &AMP; Wesson
would suffer for this agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a firestorm in the industry in which every other
manufacturer will treat Smith &AMP; Wesson as a pariah,'' Rand said.
``In the gun culture, Clinton equals Satan and they will see that
Smith has just made a deal with Satan.''
</P>
<P>
   Other gun-control advocates were less harsh. Garen Wintemute,
director of the Violence Prevention Center at the University of
California at Davis, said the agreement had important provisions
about the distributions of guns.
</P>
<P>
   Among them are provisions that prevent Smith &AMP; Wesson from
releasing guns for sale before background checks on potential
buyers are completed, and requirements that Smith &AMP; Wesson
employees have additional training and that new record-keeping data
be made available to law-enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This falls short of what needs to be done to adequately
regulate the industry,'' Wintemute said, ``but it's a good first
step.''

   MIDDLETOWN, Conn. _ Finding herself assigned to what is often
dubbed The Naked Dorm came as a shock to Martha Reicher, but now
she would rather not live anywhere else. It took a while, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first week of school I would have said I live in The Naked
Dorm, but now it would not be the first thing I say,'' Reicher, a
Wesleyan University freshman, said recently. ``Still, it is
definitely the part that gets the most attention.''
</P>
<P>
   This story, about how one well-choreographed rite of passage
from high school to college life can go unexpectedly awry, actually
started last year. Reicher, along with myriad high school seniors
across the country, was eagerly awaiting a college acceptance
letter. She dreamed of attending a strong liberal arts college in
the East.
</P>
<P>
   She was ecstatic when Wesleyan accepted her, and doubly thrilled
when she was assigned to her first choice of a residence hall, a
place called West College. She had been particularly drawn to West
College because it advertised itself as a diverse, multicultural,
politically active dormitory for men and women. Westco (as it is
known at Wesleyan) even required freshmen and sophomores to compete
for spots by writing essays about their interests.
</P>
<P>
   Reicher thought it would be a welcome change from her hometown,
Piedmont, Calif., an upscale community in the Oakland hills. Just
how different quickly became evident.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the first night we had a dorm meeting, and the resident
advisers said that it is a tradition of Westco that it is clothing
optional,'' she said. ``Most of the people were yelling things
like, `That is awesome!' or `This is great!' or `Wow!'''
</P>
<P>
   But Reicher doesn't recall yelling anything. Instead, she began
turning over in her head everything she had read and heard about
the dorm. ``I was shocked, thinking `Is this really what diverse
means?''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in the interest of full disclosure, it should be noted that
Westco consists of four buildings housing about 175 students, most
of whom stay clothed a lot. It's not as though residents shed their
garments as they walk in the door.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the statement that students were supposed to work
from said, in part: ``In the past, residents have organized musical
and artistic events, planned mid-semester festivals and been
committed to artistic expression, political and social activism and
community responsibility. West College strives to improve upon its
tradition by giving residents the opportunity and resources to
express themselves and create new group initiatives.'' It mentioned
nothing about clothing, optional or otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   When she found out, Reicher, 18, called her parents. Her dad
laughed. Her mother called the school and suggested that her
daughter be allowed to move if she wanted. (Her cousin, somewhat
later, called a reporter.)
</P>
<P>
   The students soon learned that, aside from residents who
developed a habit of leaving the stall doors open while they
showered in the mostly coed bathrooms, not that many people go
naked. But they can if so inspired.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just sometimes feel the need to be nude; I have body
piercings to show off,'' said Jacob Z.B. Goldsmith, a 19-year-old,
who neither volunteered, nor was asked, where the body piercings
might be, but did strip off his pants as he talked. ``There's an
exhibitionist part of me. If I feel the need to take off my pants,
I take my pants off. It's kind of cool that there is a place you
can do that.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the point of Westco. It encourages students to expose
all their interests in the theory that everyone will be enriched.
If a time traveler wanted to find a place where the ethos of the
1960s still flowered, Westco would be a holistic choice.
</P>
<P>
   Take the concept of time. Nothing officially starts on the hour
_ or even the half-hour or quarter-hour _ in Westco. The regular
wine-and-cheese social hours that rotate among the various hallways
are supposed to start at 9:13 p.m. ``Guidance,'' the name for
weekly Monday night meetings, sort of open town halls where
decisions about running the dorm are made, begins at 10:07 p.m. The
odd times are intended to jog the memory.
</P>
<P>
   Not a lot of students show up at Guidance, but its deliberations
are considered worthy of tracking for posterity. The freestyle
minutes are kept in a series of journals called ``The Book of
Love,'' kept in the head resident's room.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Amongst prodigious doodling, the books brim with notations of
resolutions taken in recent years, like, ``Make people aware of
injustice on and off campus.'' Another entry recorded a discussion
weighing a collective hair-dying session just before parents'
weekend ``just in case your parents thought you were normal.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At least once last fall the weekly telephone messages summoning
all students to Guidance trumpeted that particular meeting as
clothing optional. (The dorm's term of choice.) This tactic had
mixed results, however, with some students avoiding the gathering
and many present clad in just towels. (For those of you skimming
this article looking for the naked bits, you are here.)
</P>
<P>
   ``People have realized that having a clothing-optional Guidance
is not the best way to have a meeting,'' said Christopher C.
Connor, 22, a senior and the head resident for all of Westco. ``A
lot of people don't want to participate and a lot come just for the
spectacle.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from Guidance, there are other random moments when
nakedness is encouraged, like one corridor's periodic ``Naked
Hour,'' when anyone in the mood can show up and socialize.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if one resident objects, Connor asks the naked to
dress. He said he never encounters flak.
</P>
<P>
   The university, for its part, denies that there is an official
``naked dorm.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is folklore that it is a clothing-optional unit, but
that is not true,'' said Freddye Hill, the dean of the college and
the administration's senior representative for students in the
administration. ``We tell students that nudity is offensive to some
people, and we have to tell people not to engage in it.''
</P>
<P>
   University officials said the written rules do not specifically
ban nudity, out of concern that anything so specific would only
encourage it. But they said anyone habitually walking around in the
buff in public areas would risk being hauled in front of the
Student Judiciary Board. No one could recall such a case.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Tamara Raimundi, a senior administration official for
residential life, said one woman in Westco asked to be moved out
this year, citing nudity as one reason. ``Westco seems to be the
place that people try to do that sort of thing because they hear
the folklore and want to grab onto it,'' Raimundi said.
</P>
<P>
   Westco has a more assertive student government than the other
dorms, so naturally the very idea of letting a reporter visit had
to go before the student government for a general discussion and
vote. Then someone alerted the college newspaper, The Argus, which
wrote a front-page story about the visit. Its reporter asked
questions like, ``Is it true that you wanted to write an article
about sex and drugs and nudity at Westco four months ago but the
university president wouldn't allow it?'' (The only idea there that
is vaguely accurate is that it took four months for the dorm
consensus and the reporter's schedule to coincide.)
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Parties at the dorm, understandably, are among the most popular
on campus. And some students living elsewhere either find a way to
move in or just hang out. Katrina E. Nordine, 19, moved from nearby
Clark Hall. ``There is no life there other than beer,'' she said.
``It was not about being alive and creating things, it was about
being drunk.''
</P>
<P>
   When the weather is warm enough, some Westco students take their
clothing optional selves outdoors. (At least the guys. It is
usually the guys.)
</P>
<P>
   Reicher recalls an early fall visit by her boyfriend, ``He
walked in and said that he hadn't seen anybody naked, and he didn't
know what I was talking about, and then he looked to his left and
there were 10 guys playing Frisbee naked.''
</P>
<P>
   The whole tradition, according to Adam D. Hurter, a sophomore
and onetime resident, stems from the fact that in the late 1960s
the dorm was devised as communal housing for students and faculty
where they could delve more intensely into issues of the day. That
particular experiment ended in 1974, he said, but some of the
wackier traditions prevail.
</P>
<P>
   ``People aren't just generally wandering around naked just for
the sake of being naked,'' said Matthew D. Lerner, 18, one of the
dorm's five elected presidents. ``It's the idea of not judging
anyone, of respecting one another's beliefs. It does not have
sexual undertones.''
</P>
<P>
   That last idea takes some acclimatizing. But residents swear
that the disrobed gradually become part of the background tapestry
in a dorm teeming with musicians, painters and political
organizers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not all for attention, ooooooohhhhh, let's get naked and
have fun,'' said Reicher, who has never joined in the dorm's unclad
life. ``I guess it's normal to me now. It is part of being not
judged at all, I can be who I want to be. But I guess when I try to
describe it to my parents or relatives, they can't see how it can
be an acceptable thing.''

<P>
   Since it was founded just over a year ago, a Texas company
called Netpliance has spent millions of dollars to reach its target
market: nontechnical folks who want a simple, inexpensive device to
connect them to the Internet without a full-fledged personal
computer.
</P>
<P>
   So it came as a not necessarily welcome surprise this week when
an insatiable demand for its product emerged from the technical
folks. For an extra $100 in parts, an electronics engineer in Las
Vegas figured out how to tweak the $99 terminal, designed solely to
serve as an Internet appliance, so that it works like a full PC.
</P>
<P>
   Last Saturday, he shared his discovery on a Web site called
Slashdot, a gathering spot for computer engineers whose masthead
reads ``News for Nerds.'' Within a few hours, tinkerers across the
country were trooping into Circuit City outlets _ the only retail
chain selling Netpliance's device, the i-Opener _and jamming the
company's toll-free telephone line.
</P>
<P>
   The unanticipated demand might sound like good news for the
company. But under its razors-and-razorblades business model, it
loses money on each machine it sells. Profits are expected to come
from the $21.95 it charges customers each month to connect to its
Internet service _ a service the hobbyists are not interested in.
</P>
<P>
   And with the device in short supply _ many Circuit City outlets
say they are sold out _ unmodified i-Openers are now being resold
on the eBay auction site, with bids exceeding $250. ``This is the
one you can hack!'' one seller wrote. ``Get it before they fix
it!!''
</P>
<P>
   The attention was not of the sort Netpliance was looking for
this week as it prepared an initial public offering. Its stock,
priced at $18, began trading Friday and closed at $22.0625.
</P>
<P>
   Kent Savage, Netpliance's chief executive officer, said the
company was not worried, although it is following the activities of
its new fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We welcome the interest of the technical community,'' Savage
said. ``If this becomes a problem, we will do what we need to stop
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The $99 introductory price is scheduled to rise to $199 after
Father's Day, but even that will not approach the cost of
production, estimated by analysts at $300 to $400.
</P>
<P>
   In a testament to the Internet's capacity to quickly establish a
collective wisdom, the Web has been flooded in recent days with
tips and diagrams illustrating the cheap but technically delicate
operation that turns the i-Opener into a computer that can run word
processing programs and play digital music files.
</P>
<P>
   Netpliance's unlikely new customer base even came up with a
nickname for the sleek device: ``i-Opened-it.''
</P>
<P>
   Netpliance officials said its Internet service had attracted
14,000 subscribers since it started shipping the product in
November. The amateur modification army estimates that those in
their ranks have placed up to 3,000 orders in one week, based on
the postings in their clogged chat rooms and e-mail lists.
</P>
<P>
   Aimed at computer novices, the Netpliance service, which has
been well received by industry reviewers, includes features like a
button to order pizza online and a light that glows like an
answering machine when a subscriber gets an e-mail message. The
machine requires no time to ``boot up'' _ users simply turn it on
and off like a television.
</P>
<P>
   But the computer jockeys lining up to buy the i-Opener have no
interest in all that. And those who have bought it through Circuit
City have not been obliged to sign up for the monthly Internet
service. For those ordering directly, Netpliance this week started
billing the first month's access along with the purchase of the
machine, but consumers are free to cancel after that.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people buy the boxes for the subsidized cost without buying
the service, that's tough on their business model,'' said Bryan Ma,
an analyst at IDC Research. ``But opening up the box and
hard-wiring cables requires expertise that most consumers are not
going to have.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken Segler, the 36-year-old Las Vegas engineer who started it
all, has rooms full of computers, videogames and other gadgets that
he has opened up and modified over the years. He bought his
i-Opener when he chanced to spot it last month during a visit to
Circuit City, where he was purchasing a digital videodisc player.
</P>
<P>
   Within two hours of bringing the machine home, he said, he had
attached an extra hard drive he had lying around with a cable that
he modified to fit into the device's motherboard He set up a Web
site to describe how he did it, and began selling the cables for
$35. So far, he reports about 200 orders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardest part,'' he said, ``was opening it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Although it seems there is little danger that average consumers
will be willing or able to wield screwdrivers and solder cables to
fashion a cheap computer, the implications of the modified i-Opener
have attracted widespread interest.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Carvin, who heads the efforts of the Benton Foundation to
address inequity in computer access, e-mailed an article on the
subject from the Wired News site to the organization's ``digital
divide'' mailing list.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's a device that opens up new possibilities for people who
can't afford computers but have the skills as tinkerers,'' he said.
``It's clearly not a solution for everyone, but I can see it being
used by clubs and schools for science projects to make computers
available for children who can't afford one at home. I know a lot
of students who would love to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who have experimented with the modified device say it is
equivalent to a 150-megahertz Pentium machine _ far less powerful
than most PCs shipping today, but with its modem and LCD screen,
still a bargain. Most of the technicians fiddling with i-Openers
are less interested in saving money, though, than in the thrill of
transforming a machine designed for one purpose into something
entirely different.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Tetzlaff, 24, of Parma, Ohio, for instance, intends to use
his in the console of his 1979 Ford Bronco as a combination global
positioning system interface and digital music player. He had spent
over $400 in the last month building his own prototype of such a
device.
</P>
<P>
   ``At $99, even if you mess up the unit, it's worth it just for
getting into it and trying to modify it and adapt it to your
purpose,'' said Tetzlaff, whose mailing list for the community of
modifiers has grown to 600 members, including several from Sweden,
in a week. ``Really the bang-for-the-buck ratio is way too good to
pass up.''

TUREK'S SUCCESS IS NO SURPRISE TO KINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Andy Murray is not surprised that St. Louis' Roman
Turek is the hottest goaltender in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   Long before Turek defeated the Kings 4-0 Friday night, his Czech
National team defeated Murray's Team Canada for the 1995 World
Championships.
</P>
<P>
   But Turek, who set a franchise record with his 37th victory,
took a while to reach this status. Last year, he played for Dallas
but mostly watched as veteran Ed Belfour helped lead the Stars to
the Stanley Cup title.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even back then you could see how exceptional he is,'' Murray
said. ``Sometimes it's all about getting an opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Turek, 30, is six years older than Kings goaltender Jamie Storr,
but both were rookies last season. Turek entered this season with
just 55 games of NHL experience. Friday night was his 59 games.
</P>
<P>
   Storr said he used to look in awe at opposing goaltenders at the
other end of the ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't do that anymore,'' Storr said. ``I used to watch
(Buffalo's Dominik) Hasek like that. I have enough to think about.
But you are looking at the Vezina Trophy winner there (as the
league's top goaltender). He is playing so well, but you can't get
caught up in that. You just have to do your job.''
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!Backup goaltender:!off!With Stephane Fiset (right groin)
still at least a week from returning and Marcel Cousineau down
after an appendectomy, the Kings summoned Travis Scott from minor
league Lowell, Mass., to back up Storr.
</P>
<P>
   Scott, signed by the Kings as a free agent Feb. 18, was called
up ahead of Mike O'Neill, who hasn't played much at minor league
Long Beach because of Cousineau and Phoenix holdout Nikolai
Khabibulin.
</P>
<P>
   Scott, who has not played in an NHL game, was 13-18-5 with a
3.01 for Lowell with two shutouts. He played last season with
Biloxi, Miss. in the East Coast Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   Quick Whistles: Aki Berg, who missed Wednesday's game in Anaheim
with a concussion, skated Friday morning without discomfortand is
expected to play Sunday against Nashville. ... The Kings caught a
break in overtime Wednesday. Defenseman Garry Galley broke his
stick (begin ital)twice(end ital) during the Ducks overtime flurry
with a four-on-three advantage. When a defenseman breaks his stick,
a winger is expected to give up his. Galley, who shoots left, was
given a stick by Bryan Smolinski, who shoots right. The Ducks did
not score. ... Reminder: Sunday's game with the Nashville Predators
starts at 5 p.m.

 A missing link in Greenspan's labor logic  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Alan Greenspan is truly concerned about surging productivity,
he should travel to Main Street USA and talk to large- and
small-business operators alike.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve chairman could start with the Kansas City
area, where executives and managers have been working small
miracles for several years.
</P>
<P>
   When the local labor market began to tighten in the mid-1990s,
the pervasive fear hereabouts was not only finding enough good
employees to keep businesses growing, but in some cases just
maintaining staffing levels adequate to keep the doors open.
</P>
<P>
   The labor situation, if anything, probably is worse now than any
of those worried managers dared imagine when they first felt the
crunch. Despite the apparent dearth of available workers, however,
Kansas City's economy is thriving. There have been no signs of mass
business closings due to inadequate labor supplies. Service at most
enterprises remains at acceptable levels even when the inexperience
of some employees is obvious. And complaints from managers coping
with the problem have been relatively muted.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, life goes on pretty much as usual despite what
is arguably the tightest local labor market since World War II.
</P>
<P>
   If Greenspan were to visit Kansas City, it is here he would see
firsthand the rewards of America's soaring productivity rates. It's
not just a high-tech phenomenon. Business operators at the most
basic level are managing smarter because they must be innovative
just to survive, much less prosper.
</P>
<P>
   A veteran of the business-cycle wars recently wrote to take
issue with what he sees as the flaw in Greenspan's contention that
tight labor markets risk wage inflation that will metastasize
throughout the economy. In his view, a labor squeeze produces
``exactly the opposite effect,'' because as volume surges in the
absence of more hires, there's more output from the existing work
force. Meantime, a staff working harder doesn't necessarily
translate into a need to grant inordinate pay raises.
</P>
<P>
   Someone who has never met a payroll, except perhaps on Wall
Street, can't truly appreciate this aspect of Main Street
economics.
</P>
<P>
   As the valued contributor noted, smart business managers always
wait to see whether increased business activity is ``for real,''
and not transitory, before hiring more workers.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, he concluded, as business revenues increase, ``the
impact on productivity is very favorable. Even if (wage) rates
accelerate, unit labor costs remain under control because of
productivity gains.''
</P>
<P>
   If Greenspan thinks he can solve the inflation problem with a
soft-landing recession, he is making a big mistake. When a weaker
economy transforms business volume increases into decreases, the
manager is stuck with the additional employees. Layoffs eventually
will correct the problem, but productivity still falls.
</P>
<P>
   Inflation may or may not occur during this reversal of fortunes,
but it's more of a risk than when productivity is rising because
managers will be trying to raise prices to offset their work
force's decline in productivity.
</P>
<P>
   Put another way, if Greenspan's reasoning is sincere, his logic
is missing something, because a weak economy would pose as much
inflation risk as a healthy economy.

CHRISTI FINCH, 54, WHO SOLD LUXURY TAKEOUT FOOD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ore.)  (lb) 
 By MIMI SHERATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Christi Finch, whose catering shop, Word of Mouth,
was among the first to produce luxury takeout food on the Upper
East Side of Manhattan, died on Tuesday. She was 54.
</P>
<P>
   Her death, at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan,
came after a prolonged gastrointestinal illness, her family said.
</P>
<P>
   Finch's down-home charm made even the newest customers feel
welcome when they shopped for delicacies like brandied pate and
spiced pumpkin mousse or homespun offerings like meatloaf and giant
chocolate chip cookies.
</P>
<P>
   Finch and her partner, Eileen Weinberg, opened the first Word of
Mouth in 1976, at a time when most takeout food was mundane. The
partners had met at Flower and Fifth Avenue Hospital, where they
both worked in administration. Discovering a shared love of food,
the two self-taught cooks baked cakes for doctors, some of whom
became their backers.
</P>
<P>
   Together Finch and Weinberg turned out their interpretations of
ethnic foods, with a strong emphasis on Mediterranean cuisines,
including Moroccan specialties, then rare in New York City. They
offered copious portions of dishes that were lusty, yet subtly
stylish, and their high prices rarely deterred the affluent
customers in the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the shop moved to its present quarters in 1979,
Weinberg left to open a restaurant and her own takeout food shop,
Good and Plenty to Go, in the Theater District.
</P>
<P>
   Finch also opened Cafe Word of Mouth and began to work on a
cookbook. The restaurant and cafe are still open.
</P>
<P>
   Christi Kangas grew up in a food-oriented family in Cutler City,
Ore. Her father, George Kangas, was in the grocery business, and
her mother, Janice, tested recipes at home for a local flour mill.
Finch's lifelong appreciation of the freshest seasonal produce
began in the vegetable garden of her grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   As a young woman, Finch settled in New York, where she married
Thomas Finch in 1967; they were divorced a few years later.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by her daughter, Pilar; her parents, of Lincoln
City, Ore.; and her sisters, Kathryn Amrani, Sheila Coventry and
Sharon Borgford, who all live in the Portland, Ore., area.

`THE GIRL' IS SET TO LEAD GERMANY'S DOMINANT POLITICAL PARTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to add `Zeitung' to Frankfurter Allgemeine   in 12th graf.)  
(mk) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ In paternal, if not quite patronizing, tones, Helmut
Kohl liked to call her ``das Maedchen'' _ ``the girl.'' Now the
wide-eyed girl from the east has turned on the former chancellor
and is about to usher in a German political revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Her name is Angela Merkel, and in the space of a few weeks all
resistance to her nomination as the next leader of Germany's
dominant postwar political force, the Christian Democratic Union,
has fallen away.
</P>
<P>
   With endorsements pouring in from all levels of the party, it is
now inevitable that the executive board of the Christian Democrats
will nominate her as the next party leader at a meeting here on
Monday, opening the way for Merkel to become the first woman to
head a major German party.
</P>
<P>
   But the change Merkel represents is much greater than one of
gender. It is religious, generational, moral and geographical. With
one of those strange lurches that characterize the way this
generally conservative country moves forward, Germany is reaching
out for entirely new political blood.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the lurch lies the financial scandal that has engulfed
the Christian Democrats, tarnishing the reputation of Kohl, who has
admitted accepting more than $1 million in illegal payments, and
ultimately obliging his party to look in directions unimaginable
until recently.
</P>
<P>
   Where Kohl comes from the Rhineland, home of Konrad Adenauer and
the heartland of the postwar Republic, Merkel grew up in the
formerly communist east. Where he is Catholic, she is Protestant.
</P>
<P>
   Where he is almost 70, a man indelibly marked by the Nazi years,
she is 45, a woman shaped by another trauma _ Germany's division
and unification. Where Kohl is domineering, she seeks grass-roots
consensus with a cool precision that seems to reflect her
physicist's training.
</P>
<P>
   It is a measure of the Christian Democrats' problems that this
radical change is being made through an overwhelming consensus. One
by one, Merkel's potential opponents for the leadership, including
heavyweights like the former defense minister, Volker Ruehe, have
dropped out with no more than a whimper.
</P>
<P>
   ``She represents a new departure, a totally new type of
political figure at the top,'' said Karl Kaiser, a political
analyst. ``To have a woman from the former communist East Germany
leading the country's foremost conservative party is a measure of
the political rupture of recent months.''
</P>
<P>
   It was precisely because he was Kohl's protege, and because he
himself also admitted taking secret donations, that Wolfgang
Schaeuble, the former chancellor's immediate successor as party
leader, was obliged to quit last month after just over a year at
the helm.
</P>
<P>
   Merkel, the party general-secretary, was waiting. From the start
of the financial scandal late last year, she had distinguished
herself by her evident dismay at the party slush funds, by her
determination to root out such practices, and by her indignation at
Kohl's insistence that his ``word of honor'' prevented him from
revealing the names of anonymous donors.
</P>
<P>
   In a much-noted article in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung
last December, she wrote: ``Mr. Kohl's admissions have damaged the
Christian Democrats. Putting a word of honor above the law is not
comprehensible when one has committed a criminal act.''
</P>
<P>
   She continued: ``The Christian Democratic Party must learn to
walk by itself, without its old war horse, as Mr. Kohl often
referred to himself. Like someone in puberty, it must make the
break from home.''
</P>
<P>
   The words were literally stunning. They carried all the
straightforward indignation of an easterner who had absorbed years
of post-Cold War moral lessons on the iniquity of the communist
system only to discover abruptly that the venerated ``chancellor of
unification'' had been ready to place himself above the law.
</P>
<P>
   Merkel's clean break with Kohl _ made before that of any other
prominent party members _ impressed many people because the former
chancellor himself had plucked her from relative obscurity to
become his trophy easterner after unification.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Hamburg in 1954, Merkel moved as a child to the former
East Germany, where her father, a pastor with left-leaning ideals,
worked in Brandenburg. She trained as a physicist and worked as an
academic before beginning her political career as the deputy
spokeswoman for the first and last freely elected East German
government of Lothar de Maiziere in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   In the same year, she joined the Christian Democrats and, after
unification, was named minister for women and youth by Kohl. It was
then that he adopted the epithet ``das Maedchen'' for a woman whose
placid appearance and air of innocence belie intelligence and
ambition that are evidently fierce.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Even after she became general-secretary of the party in 1998,
there was no suggestion that she might rise further until the old
guard _ and a fair swath of the younger party guard from the west _
were swept away by tales of Swiss bank accounts, cash in plastic
bags and rampant dishonesty.
</P>
<P>
   Picking her way through this debris in recent weeks, Merkel has
quietly undone the critics who once considered her too young or too
Protestant or too moderate or simply too female by emerging as the
only credible voice of change.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to accept the consequences of what has happened,'' she
said on more than one occasion. ``And they are drastic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Angela Merkel is courageous,'' said Christian Wulff, one of
the first party members to promote her. ``She has the authenticity,
credibility and truthfulness that people are looking for in the
party.''
</P>
<P>
   That is certainly true. It is also true that Merkel has the
potential to emerge as a formidable opponent to the governing
Social Democrats and Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder because she will
appeal to women and to voters from the former east.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, she is a little-known quantity who owes her
meteoric rise as much to what she symbolizes as to what she has
said. Conservatives, especially Bavarian conservatives, suspect her
of standing too far to the left on economic issues, and she will
have a hard job shoring up the right wing of the party. Her long
cohabitation with the man who eventually became her second husband
in 1998 also raised concerns.
</P>
<P>
   But Merkel is no liberal. She campaigned last year against the
government decision to offer German citizenship to immigrants on
easier terms. More recently she has supported the bizarre electoral
slogan of Juergen Ruettgers, the Christian Democrat leader in North
Rhine-Westphalia.
</P>
<P>
   The slogan, whose xenophobic undertones appear clear, says,
``Kinder statt Inder'' _ ``Children not Indians'' _ a reference to
Schroeder's suggestion that Indians with talents in the field of
high technology should be offered residence permits as one way to
spur the German economy.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Merkel joined Kohl in parliament for a ceremony
marking the 10th anniversary of the first free election in east
Germany on March 18, 1990. It was the former chancellor's first
appearance in the Bundestag since November 24; his decline since
then was symbolized by his relegation to a less prominent seat.

BROOKS TO STICK TO MUSIC
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. _ When Garth Brooks was introduced as a
member of the Mets, he made it clear he would never trade his
career as a country singer for one in baseball. In the month since,
Brooks has managed to fit into his temporary surroundings while
never forgetting where he came from.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks is a ballplayer until Sunday, when he leaves to begin
preparations for the Academy Awards on March 26. He has not acted
like a celebrity, and he could not have afforded to. ``If he had
come in, didn't do anything and expected to get respect, it
probably wouldn't have worked,'' Mets third baseman Robin Ventura
said.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the workday, Ventura can sign a few autographs on
his way to his car and disappear into anonymity. Brooks is always a
star. Ventura does not envy that, and said he thought Brooks had
``the worst end of the celebrity business.''
</P>
<P>
   But Brooks believes the players have the greater burden. ``As
far as their talent, I've always understood that,'' Brooks said.
``As far as their kind of celebrity, would I want that? No, thank
you.''
</P>
<P>
   No player spent as much time with fans or accommodated reporters
more readily than Brooks did. But the seasonlong, day-to-day life
of a ballplayer is something he said he could not handle. There are
no reporters in Brooks' dressing room when he goes from town to
town on a concert tour. Fans do not know where he stays on the
road. He gives interviews when he has a specific reason to do so.
He performs for fans, and nobody boos. It is an insulated,
protected environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I don't want to be got to, no one can touch me,'' Brooks
said. ``If I want to blow up and I want to throw a chair through a
Coke machine, I can do it and nobody would ever know about it.''
</P>
<P>
   There is one aspect of a ballplayer's life that Brooks does
envy. ``You look in the stands and all it is are kids, and if it
ain't kids, it's a 6-foot kid that wants to be a kid,'' Brooks
said. ``That's my favorite thing about this game. Anything else
they can have _ those darn buses, those darn planes and staying in
a hotel where everyone knows where you're at, I don't see how they
do it. And 160 games a year _ are you kidding me?''
</P>
<P>
   The main purpose of Brooks' venture has been to advance his
Touch 'Em All Foundation, a charity that benefits children's
causes. He has been successful in doing that: 68 players helped to
raise $2.1 million last year, but more than 100 players, including
13 Mets, participate now. The players pledge money for each hit,
home run or any other statistical measure, and their contributions
are matched by both a corporate and a celebrity sponsor. The goal
for this year, he said, is $8 million.
</P>
<P>
   The other reason is that Brooks loves baseball. That is
reflected in his effort. ``He works harder than some guys on this
team do, and that's great,'' the reliever Turk Wendell said.
</P>
<P>
   But the baseball has not gone as well as the charity. Brooks,
who was 1 for 22 last spring for the San Diego Padres, is still
seeking his first hit this spring. He popped out twice against
Detroit Friday and now is 0 for 15 with four strikeouts. His best
chance for a hit came this week on an infield chopper he could not
beat out. Afterward, Wendell asked Brooks if he played the piano,
because it looked as if he was carrying one on his way down the
line. Brooks has earned the right to get such good-natured
clubhouse ribbing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of guys have said, `You're here now, you're one
of us,''' Wendell said. By the end of the weekend, though, Brooks
will resume his life in the world he knows best. As much fun as
baseball is for him, that is the world he prefers. &QL;

FUEL COSTS DRIVE UP PRICES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS SIEROTY  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ High fuel costs continue to impact the local
economy, helping to drive up the Los Angeles region's consumer
price index by 0.8 percent during February, the biggest monthly
gain since January 1992, the Labor Department reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Gasoline prices soared 4.5 percent during the month and are 18.8
percent ahead of a year ago. The overall market basket of goods in
the index has increased nearly 3 percent on an annual basis.
</P>
<P>
   Housing costs increased a robust 0.7 percent last month.
Household furnishings and operations costs increased 0.3 percent
for the month and are 1.7 percent above last year's level.
</P>
<P>
   Total housing costs are up 3.6 percent since February 1999, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   Transportation costs increased 1.5 percent in February. ``The
leading factor for the rise in transportation costs is gasoline,''
said Nancy A. Treadwell, a regional economist with the Department
of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Food and beverage prices last month moved up 0.2 percent and are
0.6 percent higher for the last 12 months. In February, the cost of
dining out rose 0.6 percent while prices paid for alcoholic
beverages fell 0.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in a very tight and stimulated economy,'' said Michael
Darby, consultant economist with City National Bank and a professor
at the Anderson School at UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   The only major expenditure category to show a decrease was the
education and communication index, which declined 0.3 percent last
month, but is up 1 percent since last year, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite no apparent inflation outside of energy, the Federal
Reserve Board is expected to raise short-term lending rates by a
quarter-point when it meets Tuesday in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``An interest rate increase next week won't help with the
housing shortage and with our gas supply situation,'' said Jack
Kyser, chief economist with the Los Angeles Economic Development
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Darby said Tuesday's expected increase by the Fed is ``only one
more in a series of increases.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Interest rates should continue to rise for the next three to
six months,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the middle of last year, the federal funds rate, which is
the rate the Fed charges banks for loans, has been raised 1
percentage point to 5.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Consumer Price Index for Southern California,
which includes Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino and
Ventura counties, now stands at 169.2 on the 1982-84 100 reference
base.
</P>
<P>
   Treadwell said the figure means a market basket of goods and
services costing $100 in 1982-84 would have cost $169.20 last
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``The CPI is not a cost-of-living index,'' she said. ``If the
price of beef increases, we don't switch to chicken. We stay with
the same basket of goods and services.''

CLINTON'S TRIP TO INDIA IS SEEN AS MAINLY SYMBOLIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (ADDS 3rd graf with background)  
(See also INDIA-U.S.) 
(lb) 
 By CELIA W. DUGGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ Like a family preparing for a sumptuous
wedding that will unite two great ancestral lines, India has been
dressing itself up for its first visit from a U.S. president in
over two decades _ a visit in which the world's largest democracy
and its most powerful one will again try to build an alliance that
has eluded them for a half-century.
</P>
<P>
   With President Clinton touching down here on Sunday evening,
workmen were out in force on Saturday. There were battalions of
malis _ or gardeners _ planting frowsy-headed yellow dahlias along
the route he will drive. Sweepers with spiky brooms were ridding
lawns of leaves and teams of men were pushing wheelbarrows of
steaming tar to spread in potholes.
</P>
<P>
   Indians believe that it is auspi- cious to paint their homes and
repair what is broken before the occasion of a marriage. And if the
relationship between India and the United States is to progress, a
great deal of good fortune will be required.
</P>
<P>
   But if the relationship between India and the United States is
to progress, it will require more of the genuine love that builds a
good marriage than the decoration and repair undertaken before a
wedding party.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton _ cast as an Indian bridegroom on the cover of a news
magazine here in a full-length golden jacket and curly-toed
slippers _ recently decided to make the trip despite the failure of
intensive U.S. efforts to persuade India to sign the nuclear test
ban treaty or to cap their nuclear arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   But with his tenure as president running out, Clinton's timing,
again, has not proved lucky, as relations between India and its
longtime rival and neighbor, Pakistan, have continued to
deteriorate sharply.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's decision to pay the briefest of visits to the United
States' old ally, Pakistan _ despite the explicit opposition of the
Indian prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, and his request that
the Americans instead put Pakistan on a list of terrorist states _
has tempered any euphoria here about the president's far longer,
five-day visit to India.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. diplomats, businessmen and policy analysts have been trying
to convince India, the subcontinent's economic power, that the
president's visit is fundamentally about building a broader, deeper
relationship _ one that will encompass cooperative efforts in
trade, science and technology, the environment and health, among
others.
</P>
<P>
   And the Indians, who do not like being treated as though their
country is no more important than far smaller Pakistan, seem
encouraged by a speech that Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
gave last week, and its not-so-veiled criticisms of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   While declaring India's decision to conduct nuclear tests ``a
historic mistake,'' she also said that Pakistan should take steps
to ``address the effects of terror on Pakistan's neighbors, notably
India.'' The United States has asked Pakistan to ban a
Pakistan-based Islamic fundamentalist group that the Americans have
categorized as terrorist _ and whose members are waging a holy war
against India in the disputed territory of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians in India applauded the remarks meant for Pakistan in
which Albright also said the so-called Line of Control that divides
Kashmir into Indian- and Pakistani-held portions must be respected.
India holds Pakistan responsible for organizing an incursion into
Indian territory last summer that led to a vicious confrontation
between these two nuclear-armed nations.
</P>
<P>
   The Indian foreign minister, Jaswant Singh, referred with
satisfaction on Thursday to Albright's ``reaffirmation of the
validity of the Line of Control.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Wisner, who was the U.S. ambassador to India from 1994 to
1997, said Albright's speech was an indication of the United
States' willingness to talk turkey to the Pakistanis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having watched us be careful and nuanced over the years, that
was not careful and nuanced; that was blunt,'' he said. ``If this
speech does not make clear the explicit difference in the American
view of India and Pakistan, I don't know what else you need. A
four-and-a-half day visit to India and a four-and-a-half hour visit
to Pakistan?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The estrangement between India and the United States _ two
great, multicultural democracies that would seem to have so much in
common _ stretches back to the 1950s and the height of the Cold
War. India, the proud new nation finally freed of colonial
domination, chose the path of nonalignment, while Pakistan, its
smaller, insecure neighbor, sought to ally with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Through the years, the Americans grew cozy with Pakistan's
military dictators, funneling billions of dollars in military aid
that sometimes wound up turned against India. By the early 1970s,
India had drawn closer to the Soviet Union. When the Soviets
invaded Afghanistan in 1979, India refused to condemn the
aggression, while Pakistan was a key player in U.S. support for the
Islamic mujahedeen battling the Soviet army.
</P>
<P>
   With the crumbling of the Soviet Union and India's decision in
1991 to begin loosening barriers to trade and investment, the
conditions that had kept socialist India and capitalist America
apart were profoundly changed.
</P>
<P>
   Still, old habits of mistrust die hard. India, craving
recognition as a global power, often finds what it sees as U.S.
arrogance hard to take. In the eyes of many Indians, the U.S.
opposition to the nuclear tests seemed the height of hypocrisy,
coming from a nation that still has thousands of nuclear warheads.
</P>
<P>
   The former Indian foreign secretary, J.N. Dixit, has described
the Indo-American relationship with the Hindi word ``panga,'' which
roughly translates as prickly, petulant, confrontational.
</P>
<P>
   K. Subrahmanyam, who recently headed a committee that looked
into army intelligence failures for the Indian government, offered
a perfect illustration of panga in his contentious reaction to
Clinton's tour of India.
</P>
<P>
   ``This visit is purely symbolic of the fact that two years after
the nuclear tests, India has done nothing to comply with the
stentorian demands of the nuclear hegemonists and still the U.S.
president is coming to visit,'' Subrahmanyam declared in his own
stentorian tones. ``In spite of all the rhetoric, the United States
accepts reality.''
</P>
<P>
   A stream of Americans from Washington institutions have come
through Delhi in recent weeks and many of them have been advising
the president to brave the thorny task of talking with the Indians
for the sake of the rose _ better relations with a country that is
the second-most populous in the world, with an economy growing at a
rate that has averaged over 6 percent since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Few expect any developments of earth-shaking importance from the
visit. India has already declared that the test ban treaty and its
relations with Pakistan are not open for negotiation. Still, given
the history, the symbolism of the visit itself may have content.
</P>
<P>
   Like the rituals of a wedding, the ceremonies of a state visit
could lay the foundations for a new understanding _ at least that
is what diplomats on both sides hope.
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd I. Rudolph, an old India hand and a political scientist at
the University of Chicago, said that after over 20 years of neglect
_ the last visit of a U.S. president was that of Jimmy Carter in
1978 _ the Americans need to finally go and pay their respects.
``You sometimes have to have a cup of tea before people will trust
you,'' he said.

KINGS SHUT OUT BY BLUES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Ziggy Palffy watched on TV from a table in the
Kings' trainers room and said that was real pain.
</P>
<P>
   So is the thought that without Palffy, who could be sidelined up
to a month with a sprained right shoulder, the final three weeks of
the regular season could have moments like Friday's 4-0 loss to the
St. Louis Blues.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was tough; you want to help,'' said Palffy, who raised
his arm to shoulder level after the game, but not without a great
deal of difficulty. ``I'm not sure how long I'll be out, but when
you are playing a team as tough the Blues you want to have everyone
helping out.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Kings were helpless against Blues' goaltender Roman
Turek, who handed them their first shutout since Feb. 28, 1999
against eventual Stanley Cup champion Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   This time it came against the Blues (45-17-9), who have the best
record in the NHL. Turek, who came in with a 1.98 goals against
average and came away with a franchise record 37th victory, turned
away 31 shots.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Handzus had two goals and Pavel Demitra scored an empty
netter with two minutes left after Jamie Storr was pulled.
</P>
<P>
   But the Kings (34-28-9) already were struggling on the power
play and without Palffy, who was injured Wednesday on a hit by
Anaheim's Vitaly Vishnevski, things only got worse. The Kings were
0 for 7 with the man advantage and now are 1 for 32 in their last
six games.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings have a favorable schedule down the stretch and came in
leading the ninth-place Ducks by 10 points. But losses could impact
playoff seedings and the eighth spot is only four points away.
</P>
<P>
   If the Kings finish there, they would face St. Louis in the
first round. The Blues are 10-1-3 in their last 14 games against
the Kings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now all we're thinking about is getting in, not who we
are going to play,'' Luc Robitaille said. ``Tonight, we missed a
lot of opportunities. You have to score on the power play to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the power play, the Kings looked shaky on the Blues'
first two goals, both in the second period. Storr let Handzus poke
the first one through his legs after a rebound.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Jamie would tell you that was a bad goal,'' Kings
coach Andy Murray said.
</P>
<P>
   On the Blues second goal, defenseman Jere Karalahti turned the
puck over in his own end. Jochen Hecht took a pass from Marty
Reasoner and beat Storr at the 7:39 mark.
</P>
<P>
   Handzus, who took over as the Blues first-line center in January
when Pierre Turgeon went down with an injury, made it 3-0 when he
parked in front and whacked in his own rebound.
</P>
<P>
   In the third period, newest King Nelson Emerson had a chance
toend the shutout, but Turek was on his game.
</P>
<P>
   Emerson, who had an assist in Wednesday tie with the Ducks, had
four shots Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings had toyed with the idea of moving him onto the first
line after Palffy went down, but the second unit has shown good
chemistry since Emerson was acquired with Kelly Buchberger last
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Blake replaced Palffy.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first got hit I wasn't sure how bad it was,'' Palffy
said. ``I woke up today and I could move it better, but it was
still pretty sore.''
</P>
<P>
   So are the Kings, who face lowly Nashville on Sunday at Staples
Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't available so I tried not to think about him,''
Murray said of Palffy. ``You have to got with what you have. We
will move on without him.''

THE SAN FRANCISCO EXAMINER IS SOLD BY HEARST TO A LOCAL NEWSPAPER
OWNER 
</HEADLINE>
   (CORRECTS circulation figure in 7th graf) 
 (js) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER and EVELYN NIEVES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hearst Corp. sold the San Francisco Examiner Friday, the
newspaper that set William Randolph Hearst on his swashbuckling
publishing career, to the owner of a local newspaper. The new
owner, Ted Fang, vowed that the Examiner would be reincarnated as a
morning paper and would continue its two-fisted competition with
the San Francisco Chronicle, which Hearst bought in August.
</P>
<P>
   Against the odds, the deal keeps San Francisco in the thin ranks
of cities with two competing dailies.
</P>
<P>
   In a single, unexpected stroke, the deal also achieves the
disparate objectives of the haphazard group of politicians,
regulators and businessmen who were tossed into a debate by the
mixmaster of San Francisco politics.
</P>
<P>
   It catapults Fang, who is 37 and a member of a well-connected
family with a strong political base in San Francisco's Chinatown,
into prominence as one of a tiny group of Asian-Americans in top
daily newspaper jobs.
</P>
<P>
   It also represents a success for the city's mayor, Willie Brown,
who had made it his business to make it difficult for Hearst _
whose reporters had long dogged the city's contract dealings _ to
quietly close the Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   And Hearst can now focus its money and energies on expanding the
reach and breadth of the San Francisco Chronicle, the city's
dominant daily. The deal also ensures that Hearst can make plans
without worrying about the existing joint operating agreement
between the Examiner and the Chronicle, which expires when the deal
is completed.
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle, the largest newspaper in Northern California,
faces tough competition to the south and east from The San Jose
Mercury-News and The Contra Costa County Times, both owned by
Knight Ridder. More than half the 457,000 copies of the Chronicle
circulated every day go to suburban areas peppered with the newly
minted millionaires of Silicon Valley's new economy.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview Friday Fang said, ``San Francisco has
once again proved itself as the city that knows how _ the first
city in recent history that has saved a second newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I would say this is a unique ending for the most
unique city in America.''
</P>
<P>
   The financial terms of the deal were not immediately disclosed.
According to one Hearst executive, Fang's new company, ExIn LLC, is
buying the Examiner's name and circulation list, some delivery
trucks and news racks. It is also assuming some current Examiner
liabilities, according to a release issued by the two companies.
</P>
<P>
   The companies, which committed to a four-month transition period
during which Hearst will continue to handle basic management
functions and advertising sales at the Examiner, also noted that
Hearst would make ``a significant financial commitment to the
continued publication of the Examiner.'' There was no further
elaboration.
</P>
<P>
   That subsidy, whose amount and duration was not disclosed,
appears to be the price that Hearst, the privately held New
York-based media company, was willing to pay to achieve its
objective _ publishing the dominant local newspaper in one of the
nation's wealthiest and best-educated markets _ without running
afoul of federal antitrust regulators.
</P>
<P>
   The sale was handled by the New York investment firm, Veronis &AMP;
Suhler.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One individual with knowledge of the deal said that no
traditional newspaper companies had been among the final three
bidders for the Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   Fang _ whose current newspaper is the thrice-weekly, free San
Francisco Independent _ said that the deal did not include any
presses or real estate, which Hearst had recently offered along
with the Examiner's name and circulation list. The sweetened offer
to prospective buyers of the afternoon newspaper, whose circulation
of 107,129 is mostly based in the city, came as Hearst came under
close scrutiny by the Justice Department's antitrust lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   It also faced a private civil lawsuit, on similar antitrust
grounds, by Clinton Reilly, a former mayoral candidate who had his
ankle broken several years ago in a tussle with the Examiner's
executive editor, Phil Bronstein.
</P>
<P>
   Bronstein is one of a group of Chronicle and Examiner editors
from which Hearst executives will select the leadership of the
joined newsrooms. They include the Chronicle's executive editor,
Matt Wilson, a longtime editor with a scholarly mien; Jerry
Roberts, the Chronicle's managing editor, credited with increasing
the newspaper's aggressiveness and thoughtfulness in recent years;
and Sharon Rosenhause, a managing editor of the Examiner, who has
been a brusque champion of covering the city's mosaic of minorities
and its gay community.
</P>
<P>
   The newsrooms of the Chronicle and the Examiner, which share the
third floor of their building, are physically divided as if by a
gulf by a large composing room used by both newspapers and
psychically divided by their longstanding, fierce competition. They
came together for the first time in memory Friday as a prospective
team: Hearst had guaranteed jobs to all Examiner employees who
didn't want to work for Fang, and apparently, none did.
</P>
<P>
   Both staffs _ the Chronicle's newsroom numbers about 315, the
Examiner's about 200 _ gathered by the Examiner's city desk to hear
the terms of the sale. Reporters and editors at both papers then
spent the afternoon expressing relief that jobs were guaranteed but
were wistful at the impending death of the Examiner they knew.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists with the Examiner, which has a messier newsroom and
the reputation for quirkier, more enterprising stories, said they
were saddened that the newspaper's name and its logo _ an eagle _
would adorn an unknown, unproven new entity.
</P>
<P>
   Keay Davidson, a science writer at the Examiner for 14 years,
said: ``It was always a feisty, eccentric, off-beat newspaper. I
think that it's one of the few last outposts of idiosyncrasy in
American journalism and I doubt it will be that anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   No staff members at the Examiner said they would be willing to
work for the new Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   Bronstein, the executive editor of the Examiner dismissed rumors
that, as the ranking editor of the Hearst newspaper, he had the
inside track. ``I don't know what I'll be doing yet,'' he said.
``I'm glad that there's finally some resolution. People seem
pleased that they have the opportunity to work for the morning
newspaper. I think everyone is enthused about working for a great
newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Chronicle, Ken Connor, an assistant city editor, said
that his staff hoped the Chronicle's management remained in place.
``We have people who we trust and respect,'' he said. ``I think the
feeling now is that people don't know what's going to happen.
There's going to be some overlap. We only need one television
writer, for example.''
</P>
<P>
   The uncertainty was intensified in recent months when a
collection of political odd bedfellows _ including the mayor and
Reilly _ the conservative, non-union newspaper of Fang and the
loudly radical alternative newsweekly, The Bay Guardian, all made
it clear that San Francisco wouldn't become a one-newspaper town
without a fight.
</P>
<P>
   That the fight should end with Fang's ownership of the Examiner
represented an exquisite, if belated, justice for the Chinese
populations reviled in the pages of the newspaper a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas C. Leonard, the associate dean of the Graduate School of
Journalism at the University of California at Berkeley, said
Friday: ``The exquisite piece of irony here is that both the
Chronicle and the Examiner got their start playing into the strong
anti-Asian period in California in the 1880s. I think that to find
more than a century later that the key to their business plans is
an enterprising Chinese family _ that's a real story about
America.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Chronicle and the Examiner had been business partners since
1965, when the joint operating agreement was established, combining
the advertising and circulation departments of the newspapers. At
the time, the Examiner, then a morning newspaper, agreed to publish
in the afternoon. On Sunday, the newspapers publish a joint edition
which sells 578,541 copies, according to the Sept. 30, 1999,
figures of the Audit Bureau of Circulations.
</P>
<P>
   Fang, the son of a Chinese journalist who left the country after
the communist takeover, said Friday that he would not shut down The
Independent to publish the Examiner, and he would not pull punches
in either publication. ``My family and my newspapers have never
been one to shy away from taking positions on issues we feel are
important to San Francisco,'' he said. ``That policy will
continue,'' though the news operation would remain independent of
the paper's editorial pages.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Examiner will not be the Independent,'' he added.
``Rather, the Examiner will offer a new voice alongside that of the
Chronicle and the Independent.''

BRAZEN THEFT LATEST ACADEMY MISHAP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Daily News Staff Writers Val Kuklenski and Lisa Van Proyen
contributed to this story.) &HT;      By MARLA MATZER ROSE   
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Wanted: 55 naked gold men coveted by Hollywood's
elite. Last seen earlier this month on a shipping dock in Bell on
their way to the Academy Awards ceremony scheduled at the Shrine
Auditorium on March 26.
</P>
<P>
   Someone out there may have taken this year's Oscars for a prank
or to sell them profitably in the black market, but the Academy of
Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences called it a crime Friday. The FBI
was called in to aid local police and a $50,000 reward was posted.
</P>
<P>
   The theft, disclosed almost a week after the incident, is the
latest mishap that has had the publicity department of the academy
in crisis mode in the final weeks leading up to the March 26 awards
ceremony. Earlier this month, the post office misplaced thousands
of Oscar ballots that had to be reissued.
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference Friday morning, academy Executive Director
Bruce Davis downplayed the disappearance of the unengraved
statuettes and tried to make light of the unfortunate situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contrary to some reports, this is not the end of the Oscar
ceremony for this year. It is an interesting but relatively minor
glitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis said there will be enough Oscars to go around on the big
night, even without the 50-plus golden boys that disappeared from a
Roadway Express shipping dock. The academy has 20 in stock and the
Chicago-based manufacturer, R.S. Owens, already is producing the
balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think everyone should watch the entire show on Oscar
night to see for themselves if we have enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The statuettes are 13 inches tall, weigh 8 pounds and are made
of a brittanium alloy plated with copper, silver and 24-carat gold.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said the statuettes had a combined real value of about
$18,000, but an ``inestimable'' value on the black market among
collectors. The academy forbids recent winners from selling the
statuettes, claiming they remain the property of the academy.
</P>
<P>
   Still, several Oscars given before that rule change have been
auctioned over the years and have fetched tens of thousands of
dollars apiece. The scarcity of authentic Oscars on the open market
makes them even more valuable to would-be collectors.
</P>
<P>
   However, potential black-market buyers may find Roadway
Express's $50,000 reward for information leading to a conviction
more appealing than owning one of the prizes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to be hard to fence an Oscar,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   He blasted Roadway, hired by R.S. Owens to transport the awards
to academy headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``They apparently have a semicasual attitude about security,''
said Davis, adding there was ``no evidence'' that the cargo was
being guarded when it disappeared in Bell.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone with a tip is asked to call the Los Angeles Police
Department at (213) 485-2505. Davis said investigators already had
``several strong leads'' but he would not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the additional expense of making more Oscars and
shipping them, Davis said, ``We're not going to pick up the check
on this one. Talk to Roadway.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis said Roadway was chosen by R.S. Owens this year after the
academy was accused of ``an old-fashioned publicity stunt'' in the
past two years. In 1998 and 1999, Davis said, the academy made a
big deal of transporting the statuettes under heavy security all
the way to Beverly Hills.
</P>
<P>
   The award cartons were bulky and weighed 50 pounds apiece, ``so
these weren't something you could pick up and throw in your
trunk,'' Davis said. The boxes were unmarked and shrink-wrapped, so
it's possible whoever took them didn't know what was in them.
</P>
<P>
   One reporter, though, claimed to have heard dockworkers telling
a radio reporter that they had taken out the statuettes to admire
them and pose with them for pictures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would want to confirm that,'' Davis said gravely, ``but that
would concern us.''
</P>
<P>
   In a bizarre twist on the whole situation, the city of Bell is
also where hundreds of misdirected Oscar ballots surfaced because
they were being handled as third-class mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're telling (Academy Awards host) Billy Crystal to stay away
from Bell,'' Davis joked. ``It seems to be a sort of Bermuda
Triangle for Oscar things.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he thought this incident could cause a ratings
bump for the Oscar telecast, Davis said straight-faced: ``We'll
look at the ratings closely this year, and possibly arrange to lose
another shipment next year.''
</P>
<P>
   In true Oscar fashion, the story attracted its own publicity
hangers-on. Internet site IGN.com, which has been conducting its
own online movie awards poll, is offering a reward of $5,000 and an
Oscar reproduction for information leading to an arrest. IGN.com
has set up an e-mail address to receive leads
(www.missingoscarsIGN.com) and will forward those leads to
authorities. &QL;

PEPPERDINE ROUTS INDIANA

   BUFFALO, N.Y. - Buffalo might be the last place you'd chose to
prove a national point. The only thing this city has in common with
a media mecca like New York City is the N.Y. that follows it's
name.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the precise location for Pepperdine's plea for
nation-wide respect was out of its control. The Waves were just
happy for a platform, no matter how remote an area it was situated.
</P>
<P>
   And so Pepperdine came here this week hoping to state its case.
Not just that it beloned in the NCAA Tournament, but that it could
compete with the nation's elite.
</P>
<P>
   And win.
</P>
<P>
   The Waves, in a shocking, emphatic way, did just that Friday
night, beating up on Indiana 77-57 in a first-round East Regional
victory at HSBC Arena. It is Pepperdine's first Tournament victory
since 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine (25-8), the 11th seed, moves into the second round
Sunday against third-seeded Oklahoma State.
</P>
<P>
   The Waves are the lowest seed to advance in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't just a win, it was a statement. For Pepperdine,
which came here craving a spolight, and the West Coast Conference,
which is now 2-0 in the tournament after wins by the Waves and
Gonzaga, which beat Louisville Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great team effort offensively and defensively, an
exciting win'' Pepperdine coach Jan van Breda Kolf said. ``But I've
been excited all year. Our goal was to get to Syracuse (the Sweet
16) and we have onemore game to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Tezale Archie agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Gonzaga put (the WCC) on the map last year, (by
getting to the Elite Eight). They won (Thursday) and we wanted to
keep it up,'' Archie said. ``But we're just halfway to our goal. We
wanted to win two and get to Syracuse. We're half way there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Waves said all along they wouldn't be intimidated by
Indiana's history and higher seeding, and they weren't. From the
outset Pepperdine went right at the Hoosiers (20-9), opening an
18-8 lead on Tommie Prince's 3-pointer, then extending it to 28-11
on Nick Sheppard's short jumper with 8:43 left in the first.
</P>
<P>
   Sheppard, whose had an up and down year, got off to a fast
start, picking up nine points and a blocked shot in the first 10
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   With Sheppard providing a presence inside, things opened up for
the Waves perimeter players.
</P>
<P>
   Brandon Armstrong was especially effective, hitting four
3-pointers over the first 14 minutes. With the outside game
rolling, he went to work off the dribble, breaking down Indiana's
Michael Lewis on three drives to the basket, finishing with 18
points in the half, and 22 overall.
</P>
<P>
   Defensively Pepperdine did exactly what it's done all year:
Create havoc with its fullcort pressure, force turnovers (eight in
the half, 21 forthe game) and take its opponent's top scorer out of
the game.
</P>
<P>
   A.J. Guyton, Indiana's first-team All-American, didn't attempt a
field goal in the first 18 minutes and rarely touched the ball in
that time. Guyton, who came in averaging 20.3 points, was never a
factor, finishing with three points on three free throws. He
attempted just two shots.
</P>
<P>
   The Waves threw a varity of different looks and players at him,
but mostly just kept the ball out of his hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everywhere I went they had two guys waiting for me,'' Guyton
said. ``They just did a great job defending me.''
</P>
<P>
   The lead grew to 39-19 on a pair of free throws by Prince with
3:35 left.
</P>
<P>
   By then a tone had been established. Pepperdine was more
athletic, quicker to loose balls and rebounds (24-16 in the half,
40-34 in the game) and had more options offensively.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just got pounded,'' Indiana coach Bob Knight said. ``They
played really well. I was impressed when I (scouted them). I
thought they were very athletic and aggressive, and tonight they
came to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong led the way offensively, but Sheppard had 17 points,
Craig Lewis had nine and Prince and Kel vin Gibbs each had eight.
</P>
<P>
   Kyle Hornsby had 15 for Inidiana and Jeffery Newton had 13, but
no other player had more then six. Kirk Haston, the Hoosier
second-leading scorer, left the game after two minutes with a leg
injury.
</P>
<P>
   The key all year for the Waves has been its defense, the
catalyst to big runs and an actidote for cold spells. Pepperdine
went scoreless over the first six minutes of the second half, but
during that same stetch Indiana managed just five points. The
result: Pepperdine's lead shrunk a bit, but with 14:14 left the
Waves were still out in front by 15 points, and after Sheppard's
jumper it was back up to 17, 49-32.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just kept the pressure up,'' Prince said. ``Even though we
weren't getting points we kept pressuring them, hounding them on
defense.''
</P>
<P>
   The cushion allowed Pepperdine to absorb another run by Indiana,
this one bringing the Hoosiers to within 49-38 on Hornsby's
3-pointer with 11:15 left.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine quickly took back control, getting a driving layup
from Armstrong, 3-pointers from Kelvin Gibbs and Craig Lewis and a
hook shot from Sheppard. All of a sudden the lead was 59-38.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got back to 11 and we needed to keep it going right there,
but they took it right back away from us,'' Knight said.

LION SIGHTINGS UP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ERIK NELSON  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ March has come in like a lion to the hillsides of
the suburban San Fernando Valley _ so much so that it looked,
smelled and sounded like a big, tawny cat.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, a mountain lion was captured in Hidden Hills. And
residents of Granada Hills, Encino, Tarzana, Woodland Hills, West
Hills and Granada Hills have reported seeing the big cats this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Wildlife experts warned that the sightings may be a harbinger of
things to come.
</P>
<P>
   Coyotes also are likely to proliferate as the scavengers give
birth to large litters during the area's lush season of regrowth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conditions have been very good for wildlife,'' said
Patrick Moore, spokesman for the state Department of Fish and Game.
``We expect that we're going to see a bumper crop of various
critters, and now and then, they're going to lose their way and
people are going to see them.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last several months, two dozen sightings of mountain
lions alone have been made, estimated Capt. Richard Felosky,
manager of the city's West Valley Animal Care and Control Center in
Chatsworth. The rest of the period's 50 sightings reported to the
center have been of coyotes, except for two bobcat reports.
</P>
<P>
   That might spell a rekindling of resident's fear of the animals
and conflict with animal rights advocates who oppose trapping them.
Last fall, Northridge and Woodland Hills residents sought help from
the city when coyotes made themselves at home in their residential
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Felosky's staff set traps to relocate the animals, but the traps
were quickly ordered removed by the city's Animal Services
Commission after it heard protests from animal rights groups. That
trapping ban remains in effect.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan.26, a Northridge resident reported one of the wild
canines jumping into her fenced dog run, entering a doggie door to
the garage and assaulting her Maltese. The dog was reportedly
recovering.
</P>
<P>
   This time mountain lions, also known as pumas, cougars or
panthers, might be the source of friction, now that one has been
caught in Hidden Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Felosky said it could be that the lion, which state Fish and
Wildlife workers caught and drove two hours back into the mountains
for release, may have been the same one sighted by residents of
Canoga Park and Woodland Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Since a state hunting moratorium in 1972, pumas have made a slow
but undeniably successful comeback from the first half of the 20th
century, when hunters were paid bounties for mountain lion
carcasses.
</P>
<P>
   Today, however, ``the habitat is full. We're up to our armpits
in mountain lions in this state,'' Moore said. ``There's not much
habitat left for them.''
</P>
<P>
   That is, unless you include the sidewalk on garbage pickup day.
That's where a Chatsworth resident reported seeing a puma on the
prowl Jan.3, according to a city wildlife sighting report.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan.27, Tina Hanks said she and her husband, David, heard
what they thought was a heavy person walking on the roof of their
house in West Hills.
</P>
<P>
   ``He ran outside and he saw it,'' or its face, at least, with
``big, glowing eyes'' reflecting his flashlight beam.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were a little concerned because there are kids around the
neighborhood. We called our neighbors and made sure everybody was
aware that this was going on,'' Tina Hanks said.
</P>
<P>
   It was no surprise, then, to Hanks and six other people who
reported sightings since December when state wildlife authorities
were called in by county sheriff's deputies to track down a wayward
cougar in Hidden Hills.
</P>
<P>
   The initial sighting at Long Valley and Clear Valley roads led
to a search for the animal that had a few tense moments, Moore
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sheriff's deputies saw the mountain lion and the mountain
lion saw them. The deputies skedaddled out of there and so did the
mountain lion,'' Moore said, adding that both species were wise to
avoid a direct confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually state wildlife authorities used tranquilizer darts to
subdue the animal, fit it with a radio tracking device and ship it
into the mountains in an air-conditioned truck.

CHIEF TOLD TO WORK WITH D.A.
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICK ORLOV  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Los Angeles Police Commission, seeking to end
the personal dispute that has marred the Rampart Division
investigation, ordered Chief Bernard C. Parks on Friday to
cooperate with District Attorney Gil Garcetti
</P>
<P>
   something Parks insists he has continuously done.
</P>
<P>
   Parks said he understood and agreed with the order. And he
offered a tepid apology for his part in the war of words in which
he engaged this week with Garcetti, who accused Parks of ordering
Rampart investigators to freeze out the District Attorney's Office
and provide information to the U.S. Attorney.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have made a mistake in this process so far, it is that
we have gotten into a verbal dispute with a person who has a
sagging political future,'' Parks said at a news conference after
the commission's unanimous vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not make that mistake again because the Los Angeles
Police Department personnel demand and should have better
leadership than that. And the community deserves a better work
product than getting into a personality clash with an individual
that we have clearly shown that we have very little confidence
(in).''
</P>
<P>
   Garcetti aides said the district attorney would not respond to
Parks and added that they are satisfied the LAPD will continue to
work through his office in presenting information on cases in which
officers are suspected of corruption.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's order to Parks instructs him, the LAPD command
staff and officers to cooperate with the District Attorney's
Office. The panel also instructed Inspector General Jeff Eglash to
determine whether Parks ordered officers to refuse to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   Parks said he and his officers have cooperated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We clearly understand the need and necessity and we have
always and will continue to always cooperate with every prosecuting
agency,'' Parks said.
</P>
<P>
   Garcetti, to back up his contention of the refusal of LAPD
investigators to work with his office, provided a chronology of
requests made over the past several days that were rejected. It was
given to police commissioners in a large manila envelope that was
marked ``sealed.''
</P>
<P>
   The sealed portion involved requests for information on specific
officers being targeted for investigation, spokeswoman Sandi
Gibbons said. The rest of the package included a letter from
Garcetti in which Parks is never mentioned by name
</P>
<P>
   to the commission providing his chronology of events that led to
the breakdown of communication with Parks, as well as a series of
other correspondence from his office, the LAPD and Mayor Richard
Riordan.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter, Garcetti said the problems began March 9 with a
hand-delivered letter from Deputy Chief Martin Pomeroy outlining
the department's priorities. That letter said it was the highest
priority of the department to work with the U.S. Attorney's Office.
</P>
<P>
   However, it also said the department would continue to work with
the District Attorney's Office.
</P>
<P>
   Garcetti said he learned over the last week that Parks had told
officials with the state Attorney General's Office that the LAPD
would no longer provide information to the district attorney's
special prosecution team.
</P>
<P>
   ``In private conversations with me, the chief of police stated
unequivocally that he did not intend to provide investigative
materials or investigative assistance to our prosecution team,''
Garcetti wrote. ``The chief of police has repeated this in
conversations and meetings with other federal, state and local
officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``In addition, on March 13, 2000, and March 14, 2000, five
deputy district attorneys from our prosecution and cleanup teams
made routine requests for investigative information from their
counterparts at the Los Angeles Police Department. In each
instance, our prosecutors were told by Los Angeles Police
Department detectives that they had been ordered by their
department not to cooperate with the District Attorney's Office.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcetti said he is committed to resolving the Rampart case, but
can do so only if the LAPD cooperates.
</P>
<P>
   (STORY CAN &UR;  &LR; END HERE. OPTIONAL 2ND TAKE FOLLOWS.)
</P>
<P>
   ``To date, the chief of police has been less than forthcoming
regarding his department's plans to cooperate with the District
Attorney's Office,'' Garcetti wrote. ``Contrary to the chief's
public statements, there has been no misunderstanding regarding his
refusal to cooperate with this office.''
</P>
<P>
   An LAPD official, who asked not to be identified, said Parks
``categorically denies'' what Garcetti was saying and that a
response would be developed over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Cmdr. Dan Schatz, who is heading the criminal investigation for
the LAPD, also denied that his investigators refused to work with
the District Attorney's Office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely not,'' Schatz said. ``We're just trying to figure
out what's going on with the district attorney.''
</P>
<P>
   Schatz said the only recent request for information beyond that
of this week was a request made eight days ago for a report on an
officer-involved shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We told them we had to go through a protocol to release it,
but that they could come over and look at it here,'' Schatz said,
adding the officials never came over.
</P>
<P>
   Also seeking information is the Los Angeles City Council, which
adopted a resolution supporting the commission and saw another
introduced asking Garcetti to appear before the council to make his
case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me curious to say this chief, who asked the U.S.
Attorney and FBI to come into this case, was attempting to both
broaden and limit the investigation at the same time,'' Councilman
Mark Ridley-Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is missing from the equation seems to be some indication
to the public from the district attorney to give us confidence that
we are on track with a forceful probe. If the district attorney is
doing what we hope him to do is get to the bottom of this. Let him
come forward and give this body the information we need.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcetti aides said he would consider the proposal if it is
approved.
</P>
<P>
   Other council members saw the Police Commission action as
asserting the need for civilian oversight of the department.
</P>
<P>
   ``This very clearly reiterates the appropriate lines of
command,'' said Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski, who chairs the
council's Public Safety Committee overseeing the LAPD. ``Now is a
critical time for this commission to perform.''
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Mike Feuer said it is important for officials to be
united.
</P>
<P>
   ``City leaders must stand together as one voice and make clear a
dispute between these parties is simply intolerable,'' Feuer said.
``We cannot allow this kind of dispute to imperil the fundamental
goals of the investigation under way right now.'' &QL;

LEBANON GIVES ASYLUM TO JAPANESE RED ARMY MEMBER, SENDS 4 OTHERS TO
JORDAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (ADDS 3rd graf with report that deportees were being taken to
Japan.) 
(bl)  
 By JOHN F. BURNS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon _ Lebanon granted political asylum Friday to
Kozo Okamoto, a 52-year-old Japanese who carried out a massacre of
26 people at an airport in Israel in 1972. Simultaneously, the
Beirut government ordered the deportation to Jordan of four other
members of the Japanese Red Army, an organization that was among
the world's most feared terrorist groups from the early 1970s to
the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The four deportees were immediately placed on an aircraft to
Amman, the Jordanian capital, where the government said without
further explanation that it had agreed to accept a Lebanese request
for assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Early Saturday, Agence France- Presse reported that Jordan had
de- nied the four entry, and they were instead being taken to
Tokyo, where they were expected to arrive Satur- day afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate confirmation of the whereabouts of
Okamoto, who like the other Japanese had been held in Lebanese
prisons since being arrested in 1997 on charges of being in Lebanon
illegally, forging documents and using false passports.
</P>
<P>
   The rulings on the five Japanese were handed down immediately
after a meeting of an official asylum committee headed by Lebanon's
interior minister, Michel Murr, and followed months of pressure on
Lebanon from Japan. Led by its prime minister, Keizo Obuchi, who
sent a personal emissary to Beirut late last year, Japan had sought
Lebanon's agreement to extradite the five Red Army members to Japan
for trial on charges of terrorism and offenses against the state.
</P>
<P>
   The Lebanese committee said it had decided to grant Okamoto's
request for political asylum ``because of the suffering he endured
in Israeli prisons,'' where he served 13 years of a life term for
the attack at the airport near Lod, outside Tel Aviv, on May 30,
1972. This appeared to be a reference to Okamoto's claims that he
was tortured during his time in Israeli prisons, which ended in
1985 when Israel released him as part of a prisoner exchange with
the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   The airport attack was considered one of the most brutal
terrorist attacks of its time. Okamoto and two other Red Army
members used machine-guns and grenades to attack passengers who had
arrived on an Air France flight from Rome. The dead included 16
Puerto Rican Roman Catholic pilgrims on a visit to the Holy Land as
well as eight Israelis. Another 74 people were injured. Israeli
police shot dead Okamoto's two Japanese accomplices.
</P>
<P>
   The four Japanese who were flown to Amman on Friday were Kazuo
Tohira, 47; Haruo Wako, 51; Masao Adachi, 59; and the only woman in
the group, Mariko Yamamoto, 59. Of the four, the one most wanted by
Japan was Wako, who was identified in the past by Japanese
anti-terrorist officials as the director of military operations for
the Red Army. All four were wanted by Japan for their links to a
series of aircraft hijackings, bombings and embassy takeovers that
occurred across Asia, the Middle East and Western Europe, mostly
during the group's heyday in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   While Lebanon presented its rulings on the five as a
humanitarian issue, domestic politics appeared to have been the
overriding concern. Okamoto, in particular, had been hailed as a
hero in Lebanon for the airport attack, which was viewed by leftist
and anti-Israeli groups not as an attack on innocent passengers but
as a strike for Arab rights. This was also the view pressed by
Okamoto, who wrote letters from prison in which said he had earned
the right, with the airport killings, to be considered ``a citizen
of all Arab countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats in Beirut said Lebanon's decision not to extradite the
five to Japan also appeared to have been influenced by increased
tensions in recent weeks between Lebanon and Israel. Prime Minister
Ehud Barak's announcement that Israel will withdraw by early July
from an occupation zone it has held in southern Lebanon since 1978
has led to an intensification of the warfare between Israeli forces
and Hezbollah, the Party of God, which has presented the Israeli
withdrawal as a triumph for its Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   With Hezbollah riding high in public opinion in Lebanon, the
Lebanese government, diplomats said, appeared not to have wanted to
incur popular displeasure by turning the five Japanese over to
Japan. Okamoto is particularly revered by Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
   Official Lebanese sensitivities may also have been heightened by
the decisions two weeks ago of Okamoto, Tohira and Yamamoto to
become Muslims and take Muslim first names. Adachi converted to
Christianity at the same time and married a Lebanese Christian
woman.
</P>
<P>
   The religious conversions all occurred days before the end of
the three-year prison terms imposed on the five Japanese for living
illegally in Lebanon expired on March 7, and were viewed in Lebanon
as a tactic to enhance the group's prospects of obtaining political
asylum in Lebanon, where the Arab population is divided roughly
equally between Muslims and Christians. The court that imposed the
prison terms after the five were discovered living in Lebanon's
Bekaa Valley in 1997 recommended that they all be deported after
serving the sentences.

RIVALS TODAY, POINT GUARDS WILL BE FRIENDS TOMORROW

<P>
   TUCSON, Ariz. _ Ask Matt Santangelo about the games he and Erick
Barkley played to kill time during the World University Games last
summer and he gives you the real lowdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played a lot of blackjack,'' said Santangelo, the point
guard for Gonzaga.
</P>
<P>
   ``And dice. The whole nine yards. We were in Spain and we didn't
speak the language, so there was time for a lot of guys to lose
money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Santangelo and Barkley hooked up again, embracing in
between practice sessions for Saturday's game between second-seeded
St. John's and No. 10 Gonzaga.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley, the St. John's point guard, said he and Santangelo
became close during their USA Basketball romp to the gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Matt's a good guy. He's quiet and honest with you, and that's
how you can come to trust someone,'' Barkley said. ``You don't talk
basketball but just talk about stuff going on in my neighborhood,
what's going on in his neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   As for how wild the card games were, Barkley said the favorites
were Pitty Pat and Spades. But when someone mentioned to Barkley
that Santangelo had squealed about the blackjack and dice, Barkley
smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's his story. But, yeah, anything goes,'' Barkley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a lot of fun. We didn't get a lot of sleep. We'd break
daylight and still go out and win by 50 points the next night. It
was like we'd step out on the court and our friendships helped kick
it to another level.''
</P>
<P>
   The showdown between the Bulldogs and Red Storm promises to be
wild. And at the center of it will be Barkley and Santangelo, two
of the best in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we got sent to the West and I saw St. John's was in the
bracket and we could be playing him in the second round, I got
really excited,'' Santangelo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not just because I know him but because he's one of the best
in America. There's no question about that. I'm excited as a point
guard and as a competitor to play against him.''
</P>
<P>
   The good game Santangelo and Barkley promise to deliver comes in
part from the respect they have for one another.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, take away the allegations and the accusations and the
uneasy underside of big-time college basketball, and here is what
you find:
</P>
<P>
   One player from a small school in Eastern Washington vigorously
defending a fellow point guard from New York whose life under the
NCAA microscope has grown uncomfortably hot.
</P>
<P>
   Santangelo has empathy for Barkley and what he has been going
through this season.
</P>
<P>
   Santangelo, who said his own recruitment by several big-time
basketball schools was all ``on the straight and narrow,'' knows
that Barkley has been the focus of ongoing NCAA investigations into
his cars, high school tuition money and, finally, the credibility
of his SAT scores.
</P>
<P>
   As Barkley served suspensions and continued to be investigated,
right up until the day St. John's left for the tournament,
Santangelo followed his plight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't thinking about him because I knew him, but because I
understand what it's like to be a student athlete under the
regulations of the NCAA. So definitely, I was sympathetic with the
situation,'' Santangelo said.
</P>
<P>
   And what situation is Santangelo referring to? His
characterization of what scholarship athletes face gives pretty
good insight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live by different rules. We live by different rules and
laws than other people live by, for whatever reasons. I don't want
to badmouth the NCAA, but we are under a bit of spotlight and we do
have to be careful about what we do and who we associate with.''
</P>
<P>
   The funny thing about the NCAA tournament is that it is the
showcase forum for basketball _ nirvana for the game's legion of
fans.
</P>
<P>
   But this time around, there is growing agitation from all
corners that something should be done to fix the loopholes and make
the system better for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Santangelo and Barkley have things to say about how it should be
better for the players.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an intelligent, educated person, I can look at my checkbook
and see zero, zero, zero and know there's a lot of money being made
and paid somewhere, so how come some of it can't come my way?''
Santangelo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Financially, it's tough. Someone's making a lot of money but
we're eating Top Ramen.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley, meanwhile, is not bitter, nor is he cynical about his
ordeal, although he said he would not mind an apology from the
NCAA.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had the opportunity to talk to younger guys (about how to
avoid NCAA investigations), I would tell them don't trust anybody
you're not familiar with. People will come up to you and then later
you'll get blamed for nothing. I wish (someone had told me that). I
probably wouldn't be in this situation,'' Barkley said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Barkley is exactly the sort of good-ratings-producing
competitor to whom the NCAA, CBS and the entire college basketball
machine should pay homage _ or maybe just pay.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, after listening to his mother, who told him he would
be disappointing her, himself, his team and ``all the people who
bought tickets to watch me play,'' Barkley decided against leaving
St. John's.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he is concerned about one thing _ winning _ and how much
``I just want to give the viewers a good game to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Barkley is not alone. Everybody wants he and
Santangelo and the Zags and Red Storm to burn the barn Saturday in
Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   That is why college basketball can be so compelling. It is why
it is so lucrative, such good TV programming, why it showers
millions of dollars on the key operatives _ except the ones on the
court, playing the game.

EDITORIAL: LEGAL UNIONS FOR GAYS IN VERMONT 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, March 18:
</P>
<P>
   Vermonters should be proud that they are leading the way toward
a society that values stable gay relationships. The Vermont House
of Representatives approved landmark legislation this week that
will give gays and lesbians the right to seek legal recognition of
their partnerships.
</P>
<P>
   Although the legislation does not allow same-sex marriage, it
will permit gay and lesbian couples to form unions that carry
nearly all the benefits and responsibilities of civil marriage. The
state Senate is expected to approve the bill, and Gov. Howard Dean
is expected to sign it. The legislation comes in response to a
ruling by the Vermont Supreme Court holding that same-sex couples
are entitled to the same protections under state law as
heterosexual spouses.
</P>
<P>
   This measure, the most sweeping in the nation, will create
``civil unions'' that essentially mirror civil marriages. A gay
couple would be able to apply for a license and obtain a
certificate of a civil union. The couple would be treated like
spouses in dozens of areas of life, from filing joint state tax
returns to inheriting estates to making medical decisions. A couple
that want to end a civil union would, likewise, have to go to
family court to seek a dissolution similar to a divorce.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike marriage for heterosexuals, civil unions are not
likely to be recognized in other states, leaving Vermonters who are
in civil unions without the same recognition when they travel
across state lines. Indeed, some 30 states have passed laws that
deny recognition to any gay marriages that might be performed in
other states. Nor would Vermont's civil unions be recognized by the
federal government in granting benefits that married spouses
receive.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps for political purposes, Vermont legislators felt they
had to create a new legal construct for gay couples to avoid
calling such unions marriage. Still, the legislation, though
imperfect, is a crucial step forward. It sensibly promotes the
security and stability of gay families. In time, Vermont's example
will show the rest of the country that same-sex unions are not a
threat to traditional marriage and deserve the name of marriage as
well as the law's full protection.

EDITORIAL: A BREAKTHROUGH ON GUN CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, March 18:
</P>
<P>
   In a major victory for public safety, the nation's largest gun
manufacturer, Smith &AMP; Wesson, agreed Friday to change the way it
designs, distributes and markets guns. In exchange, the Clinton
administration and other plaintiffs agreed to drop a threatened
lawsuit against the company.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement marks the first big concession by industry to the
mounting public and political pressure for stronger gun controls.
It also represents a crushing defeat for the National Rifle
Association, which has been arguing violently against the very
reforms that Smith &AMP; Wesson has now agreed to undertake.
</P>
<P>
   The deal contains nearly a dozen new measures aimed at keeping
guns from criminals or making them safer. Among the most important
is Smith &AMP; Wesson's agreement to withhold its weapons even from
authorized dealers at gun shows unless every other seller at the
show agrees to conduct background checks of purchasers. Gun-show
sales by unregulated dealers are a major source of the weapons that
find their way into criminal hands.
</P>
<P>
   The company also agreed to do business only with dealers who
pledge to release no more than one gun every 14 days to the same
purchaser. That would help eliminate bulk purchases of handguns,
another major source of the weapons that gravitate to criminals. In
the same spirit, the company agreed to sever its ties with dealers
who sell a disproportionate number of guns that figure in crimes.
</P>
<P>
   On the safety side, Smith &AMP; Wesson agreed to several new design
standards to prevent guns from falling into the wrong hands _
children, for example _ and to prevent accidental shootings. It
agreed to install trigger locks and to develop within three years
so-called ``smart-gun'' technology that will allow only the owner
of a gun to fire it.
</P>
<P>
   These and other provisions represent a huge improvement over the
modest congressional package of gun control measures that survived
the NRA's fierce opposition but now languish in a House-Senate
conference committee. Nevertheless, Congress should pass those
measures and then entertain new legislation based on the Smith &AMP;
Wesson agreement, which needs to be made applicable to the other
big gun makers.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure on these companies has risen dramatically. About 30
cities have sued them seeking to recover the costs of gun violence,
and New York state's attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, pledged
Friday to reinvigorate his campaign for a nationwide boycott by
local and state governments against manufacturers that fail to
adhere to the principles adopted by Smith &AMP; Wesson.
</P>
<P>
   Since these governments account for about one-fourth of all gun
purchases, Spitzer has great leverage if he can get the rest of the
country to go along.

EDITORIAL: PREDATORY LOAN SCAMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, March 18:
</P>
<P>
   A Minnesota paralegal realizes too late that her home equity
loan was for $13,000 more than she thought. A borrower finds out
belatedly that her $45,000 loan required not only $90,000 of
repayments over 15 years, but also a final additional payment of
$41,000. These are despicable examples of predatory subprime home
equity loans _ loans using the borrower's home as collateral that
are made to people with blemished credit records and that impose
exorbitant fees or conditions that virtually force the borrower
into foreclosure.
</P>
<P>
   As reported this week by Diana Henriques of The Times in
cooperation with ABC News, one such lender, First Alliance Corp.,
has been sued for deceptive practices by a dozen homeowners, the
AARP and regulators in several states. First Alliance and some
other subprime lenders are accused of preying upon naive and
desperate people who could not borrow from conventional lenders.
They wound up borrowing amounts they could not afford to repay at
rates that were far out of line with what other subprime lenders
were charging. First Alliance denies the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   The courts can take care of any misrepresentation or fraud, but
who should clamp down on the lenders is a trickier question.
Subprime lenders, good and bad, get their money from some of Wall
Street's finest. First Alliance's money came from securities sold
to investors by Lehman Brothers, and Lehman says it disclosed all
relevant financial risks to these investors. But underwriters do
not attest to the moral virtue of their clients.
</P>
<P>
   States, however, can step in. In New York, regulators are
designing rules that would outlaw some of the worst features of
predatory lending. The rules set limits on some of the fees that
borrowers could be charged and would require lenders to consider
whether the borrower could afford to repay the loan as negotiated.
</P>
<P>
   Subprime lenders, most of whom are legitimate, must charge
people with blemished credit records higher than normal fees and
interest rates in order to compensate for the risk. If state
regulators crack down too hard they risk driving legitimate lenders
out of the market, leaving needy borrowers in the lurch. But the
New York proposals, if anything, are overly lenient. Many of the
people in the subprime market are unsophisticated in financial
matters and easy victims for sleazy sales practices. They deserve
better legal protection.

WEST REGIONAL BOASTS COLORFUL PERSONALITIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM MOORE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ When CBS shows the West Regional games in
Huntsman Center Saturday afternoon, this is what you'll see: A
tight battle between Texas and LSU, and Wisconsin shocking Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Texas, with its formidable threesome of Chris Mihm, Gabe Muoneke
and Chris Owens, will have a frontcourt standoff with LSU's Jabari
Smith and Stromile Swift. The guards will decide this one.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin, with its precise methodical style and depth, will
outlast the more talented but youthful Wildcats.
</P>
<P>
   The announcers can be more specific with their analysis of the
matchups and tendencies. But as much as the NCAA tournament is
about players and teams, it is also about the stories behind the
dribblers and the shooters and the men who direct them. People such
as:
</P>
<P>
   -- Rick Barnes, the Texas coach who as a youngster once rode his
bike naked through his hometown of Hickory, N.C., on a dare to earn
$20 from his brothers.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes has graduated to being a prankster whose practical jokes
include stealing his buddy's '59 Corvette and squirting toothpaste
on the earpiece of an assistant coach's phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to have fun,'' Barnes said. ``Sometimes my wife asks
me: `Aren't you ever going to grow up?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes had a lot to deal with as a teenager. After his
18-year-old sister died in an auto accident, Barnes admitted that
he ``went off the deep end. I rebelled. I wouldn't go to school.''
</P>
<P>
   That led to one report card featuring straight F's. Coaches and
teachers helped the 14-year-old get back on track.
</P>
<P>
   -- Torris Bright, the LSU freshman guard who carries a Wilson
basketball everywhere he goes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women feel uncomfortable without their purse, I feel
uncomfortable without my ball,'' said Bright, who takes it to class
and even sleeps with it.
</P>
<P>
   Most kids his age name Michael Jordan, Vince Carter or Allen
Iverson as their favorite players. Bright, whose nickname is Chaos,
prefers Utah's Jeff Hornacek.
</P>
<P>
   -- Mihm and Muoneke, the Texas stars whose statistics are
impressive enough. But how about these: Mihm wears size 18 Nike
Composites and Muoneke's hands measure 14{ inches when spread out,
from the tip of his little finger to the tip of his thumb.
</P>
<P>
   -- Gilbert Arenas, Arizona's freshman guard who just turned 18
in January and was wonderfully clueless Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Mike Kelley, the Wisconsin defender who stifled
Fresno State's Courtney Alexander on Thursday night, Arenas said:
``I don't know who he is. I'm not really worried.''
</P>
<P>
   Countered Kelley: ``I certainly know who he is. He's gifted.
He's a player I don't expect to shut down.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Lute Olson. OK, you're familiar with him. But did you hear
what the Arizona coach said about his fellow Pac-10 coaches the
other day?
</P>
<P>
   He was miffed that his point guard, Jason Gardner, did not win
or share the Pac-10 freshman of the year award that went to
Stanford's Casey Jacobsen and UCLA's Jason Kapono. Coaches vote on
the awards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know my coaching fraternity is extremely intelligent,''
Olson said. ``But for awhile, I wondered about their intelligence.
I will never figure that one out, frankly.''
</P>
<P>
   -- John Brady, the LSU coach who should give hope to Washington
State fans. Working under NCAA restrictions that have reduced
scholarships he can offer, Brady has nonetheless taken the Tigers
from worst to first in the SEC in one season.
</P>
<P>
   Brady's best player, Swift, was wrestled away from Arizona,
Georgetown, Michigan and UCLA. Brady used a little coercive
creativity, telling Swift's mother that if her son came to LSU, the
coach would move a home game from Baton Rouge to Shreveport,
Swift's hometown. That was the clincher.
</P>
<P>
   A recruiting tip for Cougars coach Paul Graham, and Washington's
Bob Bender for that matter: The next time a Luke Ridnour is
waffling, tell him you'll play a home game in Blaine, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   -- Jabari Smith, LSU's starting center who, at 6-foot-11 and 250
pounds, is the biggest Jabari this side of the Huskies' Issa.
</P>
<P>
   More accustomed to performing at swamp level, the Tigers
complained about the altitude here affecting them in their
first-round escape from Southeast Missouri State.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Brady busted us for making it an excuse,'' Smith said.
``They breathe the same air we breathe. We've just got to suck it
up.''
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to fortitude, not oxygen, we presume.

CELTICS BEAT HAWKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ These are tough times for Ted Turner. How else to
characterize a guy who left Jane Fonda but kept John Rocker? Friday
night, his disappointing Atlanta Hawks finally lanced a season-long
boil named Isaiah Rider _ better late than never _ and then were
summarily trounced, 114-90, by a spirited Celtics team on a mission
to make the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics easily turned in their best road performance since
their season-opening win at Toronto, especially given the
circumstances. They shot the ball well (50 percent) and moved it
beautifully (28 assists). They rebounded (beating the Hawks, 45-35)
and defended, producing 21 turnovers leading to 25 points. It
resulted in a wire-to-wire beauty against the joyless,
passion-less, playing-out-the-string Hawks, who waived a tardy
(again) and unrepentant Rider after the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was intensity at its best,'' Rick Pitino said of the
Celtics' solid effort. ``We realize what's at stake. We got on the
floor and fought for every loose basketball. We were very hungry
for a win.''
</P>
<P>
   Antoine Walker led the way with 30 points, torching Atlanta from
near and far in another in a string of strong perfomances. He
knocked down four treys, shot 12 of 18 from the field, added 6
rebounds, 6 assists ,and 2 steals in a 31-minute virtuoso. Five
others, led by Paul Pierce with 16, were in double figures.
</P>
<P>
   The victory, coupled with Orlando's loss to Toronto, moved the
Celtics to within 1 1/2 games of the ninth-place Magic and two
games of the eighth-place Milwaukee Bucks. The Celtics have won six
of their last seven games, but Friday night represented a season
rarity: a road kill. It was only Boston's seventh road win in 32
road games and its first since Feb. 24 in Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics were dominant in a dormant Philips Arena, a typical,
Turner-esque monument to excess. (Read: lots of luxury boxes.) The
announced crowd of 11,621 represented the smallest to see the
Celtics this season. It was understandably quiet most of the night,
with the one exception being when Jim Jackson missed an uncontested
dunk, then was blocked by Tony Battie on the putback.
</P>
<P>
   That came in the third quarter. By then, the Celtics were in
total control and the Hawks were in full retreat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those guys were ready to lie down after the half and we
smelled blood,'' said Danny Fortson, who was his usual, active self
(11 points, 9 rebounds, and 4 fouls in 24 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   Boston led by 8 after one, 11 at the half, and 16 after three.
The Hawks, who now have gone two straight games against the Celtics
without seeing so much as a single lead, got no closer than 14 the
rest of the way. They made a little run in the second quarter,
twice pulling to within 3. But the Celtics recovered and Atlanta,
with no real scoring threat other than Jackson (26 points),
collapsed. No wonder Turner consigliore Stan Kasten opted for a
trip to Venezuela with the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Pitino said the team came out pressing to create an up-tempo
pace, which was how the game was played. He didn't want to see a
slowdown game with Atlanta's defenders and shot-blockers
dominating. Instead, the Celtics made the Hawks run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tempo was the theme of the night,'' the coach said. ``We
wanted to play at a high tempo, because they're going to play at a
low tempo. And with their defense, size, and shot-blocking, if you
play at a low tempo, they have a good chance of beating you at
home. If you play at a high tempo, you have a good chance of
beating them.''
</P>
<P>
   It also doesn't hurt to play the way the Celtics played Friday
night. The big question, of course, is whether they can carry it
over Saturday night in Dallas against a Mavericks team playing
excellent basketball. That has been their season-long story _ one
step forward, two steps back _ but Pitino thinks they might be
ready to start moving forward, permanently.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're playing good basketball,'' he said. ``We're getting
better. I think the guys are improving their man-to-man defense.
They pressed very intelligently. They're playing very well.''

   CIA-PROPAGANDA (Undated) _ _ Watch the 1955 animated version of
``Animal Farm,'' and you'll notice the ending is different than in
the book. Another example of Hollywood butchering great literature?
Yes, but in this case the film's secret producer was the Central
Intelligence Agency. The CIA, it seems, was worried that the public
might be too influenced by Orwell's pox-on-both-their-houses
critique of Capitalism and Communism. So after George Orwell's
death in 1950, agents were dispatched to buy the film rights to
``Animal Farm'' from his widow in order to make its message more
overtly anti-Communist. Rewriting the end of Animal Farm is just
one example of the often absurd lengths to which the CIA went
between 1947 and 1967 that are recounted in a new book. By Laurence

   TECHNOLOGY-FUTURE (Undated) _ Why should a sober warning about
technology's dangers be treated as a revelation after being
featured on the cover of the April issue of Wired magazine? In the
last week, Bill Joy, the author of the article, ``Why the Future
Doesn't Need Us,'' has been interviewed on television, written
about in newspapers, and argued about on the Internet. Yet there is
not a single point in the essay that has not already been made
elsewhere. By Edward Rothstein. (975 words)

   JAPAN-ECOMMERCE (Tokyo) _ With no further room to expand

Long accustomed to adding some 50 new products to their merchandise

   INTERNET-APPLIANCE (Undated) _ A Texas company called Netpliance
has spent millions of dollars to reach its target market:
nontechnical folks who want a simple device that will connect them
to the Internet without the need for a full-fledged personal

insatiable demand for its product emerged from a network of
self-described geeks. By Amy Harmon.

   MARKET (New York) _ If history is any guide, Thursday's powerful

advertisement has noted. But the statistics are unambiguous. By

   PAINTINGS-PHOTOS (Undated) _ When photography first arrived in
the middle of the 19th century, with all its vaunted truthfulness,
painters and sculptors did not like it one bit. They were

   MISSING-OSCARS (Hollywood) _ It sounds like the plot of a

and a reward of $50,000 has been offered for his return. Academy of
Motion Picture Arts and Sciences officials confirmed Friday that
this year's crop of 55 Oscar statuettes has been stolen from a
transportation company loading dock in the industrial city of Bell,
just south of Los Angeles. (Summary from wires) By Rick Lyman.

VETERANS GROUPS AGAINST FLAG SWAP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TROY ANDERSON  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Veterans groups said they oppose a Los Angeles
County veterans commission's request to replace the POW/MIA flag at
the Civic Center Mall with a version of the Confederate flag.
</P>
<P>
   Six years ago, supervisors voted to remove the Confederate Stars
and Bars flag, but the commission now wants it returned, which
would require the removal of the POW/MIA flag.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would consider it totally out of synch with the current
mentality of most veterans to put up the Confederate flag and take
down the POW/MIA flag,'' said Ann Mills Griffith, executive
director of National League of POW/MIA Families, which designed the
POW/MIA flag in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no reason for our POW/MIA flag to come in conflict
with any historic American flag,'' she said Friday. ``The last
thing we would want is for it to be divisive in any way. The
Confederate flag has little to do with the POW/MIA flag, while
recognizing that any flag representing the Confederacy can be
offensive to people.''
</P>
<P>
   Commission members said the Stars and Bars flag which is
different than the more commonly known Confederate flag
</P>
<P>
   should be hung in chronological order with 18 other historical
flags. They range from the 1774 Taunton flag to the 1960 Official
Flag of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   They contend the Prisoner of War/Missing in Action flag is out
of place in the display at the Court of Historic American Flags
downtown. And another one already flies across the street in front
of the county's Kenneth Hahn Hall of Administration, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The POW/MIA flag flies in its own special place of honor,''
said Sonny Sardo, a Shadow Hills resident and chairman of the
10-member veterans commission.
</P>
<P>
   The POW/MIA flag now in front of the county hall was put there
first in 1987 during a special ceremony, said Sardo, a Vietnam War
veteran who lost his leg to a land mine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly it's a very sacred flag, and I respect it
10,000percent. But having the second POW/MIA flag across the way is
just doubling our efforts,'' Sardo said.
</P>
<P>
   Veterans groups disagree.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL 2ND TAKE FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Carl Jensen, state council president of Vietnam Veterans of
America, said he could not imagine ``with all the pain and
suffering some of the Vietnam War generation has gone through''
that veterans would touch the POW/MIA flag.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't have positive karma associated with it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Al Biernesser, the Southern California legislative coordinator
for Vietnam Veterans of America, said some ``people feel a need to
be historically correct on a lot of things,'' but the Confederate
flag has generated divisive controversy in South Carolina where it
flies over the capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we want to encourage some kind of wrath here?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Strifler, a 69-year-old Valencia resident and retired Marine
sergeant, said he couldn't believe the veterans commission wanted
to replace the POW/MIA flag.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to be kidding me,'' said Strifler, a member of the
CHOSIN FEW, an organization of Marines who fought in the epic
Korean War battle at Chosin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the flag deserves to be shown, but whether to replace
it with a POW/MIA flag? I'm big on POWs.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, none of the supervisors has agreed to put the veterans
commission's request to a vote.
</P>
<P>
   Supervisors Zev Yaroslavsky, Michael D. Antonovich and Don Knabe
have declined to comment. Supervisor Gloria Molina said she is
opposed.
</P>
<P>
   Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke, the board's only
African-American, compared the Stars and Bars flag to the Nazi
flag.
</P>
<P>
   But Jeff Towery, a Canyon Country resident and state division
commander of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, said the
10,000-member international organization and the Sons of the
Revolution want the flag returned because thousands of Americans
see it as a part of their heritage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Its sole purpose is to identify troops in the field. If we get
rid of this flag, what's next?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   The POW/MIA flag was designed in 1971 by the wife of a Vietnam
War solder missing in action.
</P>
<P>
   On National POW/MIA Recognition Day in 1988, the flag was raised
over the White House. In 1990, Congress passed a law recognizing
the POW/MIA flag as a symbol of the nation's concern to resolve the
fates of Americans still prisoners, missing and unaccounted for in
Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's flown for two reasons,'' Griffith said. ``One is to
remember those who have served our country, both those who returned
and sacrificed their lives. And most importantly, as a unifying
symbol of the American people to get the fullest accounting for
those who have not returned.''

DUCKS STAY IN THE HUNT

   ANAHEIM -- The Mighty Ducks' playoff pulse had been getting
fainter and fainter in recent weeks, but Anaheim's postseason hopes
got a much needed shot of adrenaline Friday night with 4-2 a
victory over San Jose before 16,573 at The Pond.
</P>
<P>
   Technically it might not have been a must-win, but realistically
the Ducks' season was on the line against the Sharks and they
responded to pull within four points of San Jose with 10 games left
to play.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks have been getting plenty of effort, but not nearly
enough points, especially during the four-game winless streak they
snapped on Friday. Outshooting and outchancing opponents was little
consolation.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Sharks the Ducks played role reversal, especially
early in the game when San Jose dictated the pace of play and had
outshot them 10-3 in the first 9 1/2 minutes of play. On Anaheim's
fourth shot of the game Teemu Selanne gave the Ducks a lead they
would never give up.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose continued to build its shot advantage early in the
second period (20-12), but it was Anaheim that built on its lead
with a goal by Fredrik Olausson at 4:29.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie defenseman Vitaly Vishnevski got the play started when he
outfought Todd Harvey behind the Ducks net. Kip Miller got the puck
to Ladislav Kohn, who eventually fed Olausson a perfect centering
pass that the defenseman chipped past Steve Shields for his 12th
goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   That play seemed to get the Ducks' motor running and they pretty
much dominated the rest of the period. Good pressure by the No. 1
line drew a penalty and then Anaheim's second power play unit
converted it just 12 seconds later 13:32.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's cross-ice pass found Oleg Tverdovsky and the slick
defenseman did the rest. His fake shot sent one San Jose defenseman
sprawling to the ice and pulled Shields out of position. He then
took his time and slipped a shot from the left circle past
defenseman Mike Rathje's vain attempt to play goaltender.
</P>
<P>
   Tverdovsky's 14th goal extended his goal-scoring streak to three
games.
</P>
<P>
   Of course any recent Ducks game wouldn't be complete without its
nail-biting moments, and Friday night its was the first five
minutes of the third period and final five minutes of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Shields had made great saves on Kariya and Kohn to keep the
Sharks within shouting distance of the Ducks before giving way to
Evgeni Nabokov to start the third.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey scored at 1:10 as San Jose peppered Guy Hebert with 12
shots in the opening five minutes of play. The Ducks needed nearly
five minutes just to get one shot on net.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim appeared to have gotten things under control, especially
when Bryan Marchment was assessed a five-minute major for spearing
Kariya. But Anaheim was unable to generate any pressure and they
gave up shorthanded goal to Jeff Friesen at 14:45 while Owen Nolan
was in the penalty box.
</P>
<P>
   After a long stretch of San Jose domination in the first period
Selanne raced down the left wing and tried to center the puck, but
fortunately for him and the Ducks it bounced off a San Jose
defenseman back to the Anaheim winger. Selanne then skated around
the net and lifted a backhander over Shields' shoulder at 9:46.
</P>
<P>
   Selanne's 27th goal of the season was just his second in 10
games, but the Sharks were in town so it was hardly surprising. In
38 games against the Sharks, Selanne has 34 goals and 68 points.

   ANAHEIM -- The Mighty Ducks' playoff pulse had been getting
fainter and fainter in recent weeks, but Anaheim's postseason hopes
got a much needed shot of adrenaline Friday night with 4-2 a
victory over San Jose before 16,573 at The Pond.
</P>
<P>
   Then after the game Ducks coach Craig Hartsburg's blood boiled
over after watching replays with general manager Pierre Gauthier of
Bryan Marchment's third-period spear on Paul Kariya and Owen Nolan
pulling the feet out from under Pavel Trnka in the first period.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't understand why the league sent only one offical (Don
Van Massenhoven) to this game, it's terrible,'' he said. ``Nolan
slew foots Trnka and he is out (with a sprained ankle) -- we had a
guy (Ruslan Salei) suspended five games for that last year. And the
spear on Kariya is a dirty vicious play. You can't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks normally don't send tapes to the league office, but
Hartsburg said that is about to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kept our mouth shut, we've paid the price,'' he said. ``We
will send the tapes in and let the league decide.''
</P>
<P>
   The anger over the two questionable hits, almost overshadowed a
game that Teemu Selanne described as a ``Hitchcock thriller.''
</P>
<P>
   Technically it might not have been a must-win, but realistically
the Ducks' season was on the line against the Sharks and thanks to
some brilliant play by Guy Hebert pulled within four points of
eighth-place San Jose with 10 games left to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the biggest reason we won,'' said Hartsburg of his
goalie, who stopped 37 of 38 shots. ``I thought we played well in
the second period, but in the first and third he was just
outstanding.''
</P>
<P>
   On the strength of goals by Selanne, Fredrik Olausson and Oleg
Tverdovsky the Ducks took a 3-0 lead into the third period. But
Todd Harvey pulled the Sharks within 3-1 at 1:10 as San Jose
peppered Hebert with 12 shots in the first five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were talking after the second to just keep doing what we
were doing,'' said Selanne, who also added a empty-net goal with
one second remaining. ``It was great talk ... blah, blah, blah.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know when we are going to learn ... but whatever it
takes. It's two points and that is all that matters.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks have been getting plenty of effort, but not nearly
enough points, especially during the four-game winless streak they
snapped on Friday. Outshooting and outchancing opponents was little
consolation.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Sharks the Ducks reversed roles. They were outshot
38-27, but managed to win thanks to Hebert and some surprisingly
effective penalty killing by the league's worst penalty killing
unit. San Jose was 0-for-4 on the power play and generated little
pressure.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks' power play wasn't much better (1-for-6), but they did
get a power play goal from Tverdovsky to offset the shorthanded
goal that Jeff Friesen scored at 14:45 to pull the Sharks within
3-2.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose dictated the pace of play and had outshot them 10-3 in
the first 9 1/2 minutes of play, but on Anaheim's fourth shot of
the game Selanne gave the Ducks a lead they would never give up.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose continued to build its shot advantage early in the
second period (20-12), but it was Anaheim that built on its lead
when Olausson converted a two-on-one pass from Ladislav Kohn at
4:29.
</P>
<P>
   Good pressure by the No. 1 line drew a penalty and then
Anaheim's second power play unit converted it just 12 seconds later
at 13:32.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's cross-ice pass found Tverdosvky and the slick
defenseman did the rest. His fake shot sent one San Jose defenseman
sprawling to the ice and pulled goalie Steve Shields out of
position. He then took his time and slipped a shot from the left
circle past defenseman Mike Rathje's vain attempt to protect the
Sharks' net.
</P>
<P>
   Selanne's two goals were his second and third in 10 games, but
the Sharks were in town so it was hardly surprising. In 38 games
against the Sharks, Selanne has 35 goals and 69 points. &QL;

   Let the Mud Wrestling Begin
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you for your e-mail,'' Gov. George W. Bush wrote to Vice
President Al Gore. ``This Internet of yours is a wonderful
invention.''
</P>
<P>
   When the governor and the vice president exchanged sarcastic
electronic messages last week, it was as if the formalities of the
forthcoming nominating conventions had been written out of the
campaign script, and both Bush and Gore had flipped immediately to
the chapter marked ``General Election: Fall.''
</P>
<P>
   The candidates each collected enough delegates Tuesday _ when
voters in several Southern states cast ballots in contests rendered
all but perfunctory _ to secure their parties' nods.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, they were elbowing each other in the news media
for position on some of the issues that are likely to dominate the
race. Gore, trying to brush aside questions about his money-raising
practices four years ago, proclaimed himself a convert to campaign
finance reform; this month, a fund-raiser long associated with him
was convicted in connection with a fund-raising event at a Buddhist
temple.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a mistake going to that Buddhist temple,'' Gore said.
``I made a mistake in making telephone calls from my office. And I
have learned from those mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Bush sought to paint himself as the nation's No.
1. school booster. In what his staff touted as the first television
commercial of the general election, he began running an attack ad
masquerading as an issue spot. ``Under Al Gore and Bill Clinton,
national reading scores stagnated,'' said the 60-second commercial
on the air in southern Illinois. ``America's high school students
place almost dead last in international math tests.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, in Bora-Bora recuperating from his defeat,
continued to withhold support for Bush; the prospect of an
endorsement grew more remote after Bush told The New York Times
that McCain had done almost nothing to influence his views (though
Bush said the next day, ``I'm confident we can work together.'')
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Patrick J. Buchanan, in the race for the Reform Party
nomination, spoke at Harvard last week and had equally unkind words
for both Gore and Bush. No word on whether they sent him a testy
e-mail.

   Cabbies' Curious Cognition
</P>
<P>
   London cabbies are remarkable for getting you where you want to
go, fast. This is commonly ascribed to ``the Knowledge,'' the
grueling licensing exam they must take, which requires that they
virtually memorize the center city street grid.
</P>
<P>
   It's either that, or the fact that their brains have been
altered.
</P>
<P>
   In a study published last week in the journal Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences, researchers at London University's
University College report that the brains of 16 male taxi drivers,
compared with 50 other men of roughly the same age, showed enlarged
rear portions of the hippocampus, which controls our ability to
navigate. The scientists also found the area continued to grow with
years on the job.
</P>
<P>

   Let the Mud Wrestling Begin
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you for your e-mail,'' Gov. George W. Bush wrote to Vice
President Al Gore. ``This Internet of yours is a wonderful
invention.''
</P>
<P>
   When the governor and the vice president exchanged sarcastic
electronic messages last week, it was as if the formalities of the
forthcoming nominating conventions had been written out of the
campaign script, and both Bush and Gore had flipped immediately to
the chapter marked ``General Election: Fall.''
</P>
<P>
   The candidates each collected enough delegates Tuesday _ when
voters in several Southern states cast ballots in contests rendered
all but perfunctory _ to secure their parties' nods.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, they were elbowing each other in the news media
for position on some of the issues that are likely to dominate the
race. Gore, trying to brush aside questions about his money-raising
practices four years ago, proclaimed himself a convert to campaign
finance reform; this month, a fund-raiser long associated with him
was convicted in connection with a fund-raising event at a Buddhist
temple.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a mistake going to that Buddhist temple,'' Gore said.
``I made a mistake in making telephone calls from my office. And I
have learned from those mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Bush sought to paint himself as the nation's No.
1. school booster. In what his staff touted as the first television
commercial of the general election, he began running an attack ad
masquerading as an issue spot. ``Under Al Gore and Bill Clinton,
national reading scores stagnated,'' said the 60-second commercial
on the air in southern Illinois. ``America's high school students
place almost dead last in international math tests.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, in Bora-Bora recuperating from his defeat,
continued to withhold support for Bush; the prospect of an
endorsement grew more remote after Bush told The New York Times
that McCain had done almost nothing to influence his views (though
Bush said the next day, ``I'm confident we can work together.'')
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Patrick J. Buchanan, in the race for the Reform Party
nomination, spoke at Harvard last week and had equally unkind words
for both Gore and Bush. No word on whether they sent him a testy
e-mail.

   Cabbies' Curious Cognition
</P>
<P>
   London cabbies are remarkable for getting you where you want to
go, fast. This is commonly ascribed to ``the Knowledge,'' the
grueling licensing exam they must take, which requires that they
virtually memorize the center city street grid.
</P>
<P>
   It's either that, or the fact that their brains have been
altered.
</P>
<P>
   In a study published last week in the journal Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences, researchers at London University's
University College report that the brains of 16 male taxi drivers,
compared with 50 other men of roughly the same age, showed enlarged
rear portions of the hippocampus, which controls our ability to
navigate. The scientists also found the area continued to grow with
years on the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hippocampus has changed its structure to accommodate their
huge amount of navigating experience,'' Dr. Eleanor Maguire, the
research team leader, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first evidence that healthy adult brains can alter
depending on how they are used, which could lead to new treatment
for injured or diseased brains.

   ROME _ With the words, ``God wills it,'' Pope Urban II launched
the First Crusade in 1095, a bloody effort to wrest Jerusalem from
Muslim control that lasted more than 200 years.
</P>
<P>
   When John Paul II flies to Jordan this week to begin a Holy Year
pilgrimage to retrace the steps of Jesus Christ in Jordan, Israel
and the Palestinian territories, he will also be leading a crusade,
of an entirely different kind. Though the pilgrimage is mostly
private, the pope will also pursue his longtime dream of
reconciling Christians and Muslims after centuries of hostility and
mistrust. His rationale is much the same as Pope Urban II's _ God
wills it.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the the Second Vatican Council in 1965, the Roman
Catholic Church has made interfaith rapprochement part of church
teaching. This pope, whose 22-year tenure is the longest in the
20th century, has done more than any other to advance dialogue with
other churches. Reuniting Rome and the Eastern Orthodox churches
has been a major, as yet unfulfilled, goal, and he will meet with
the Greek Orthodox patriarch of Jerusalem to try to mend a schism
that dates back more than 1,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   The visit to Israel will provide the papacy's most dramatic
opportunity yet to try and heal wounds that remain deep 50 years
after the Holocaust. But the pope also wants to reach out to Islam,
hoping to give new life to a halting dialogue between the Vatican
and Muslim leaders that began in earnest 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The pope, who will meet with the grand mufti of Jerusalem,
rarely forgoes a chance to meet Muslim leaders on his travels. But
formal institutional efforts to overcome deeply rooted enmities
have met with resistance among some Muslim leaders and also within
the Vatican. At the most recent synod of European Bishops, held in
Rome last October, Giuseppe Bernardini, archbishop of Izmir,
Turkey, disrupted the genteel torpor of the speeches by warning his
colleagues about the perils of Islam. He cited an interfaith
meeting he attended where, he said, a Muslim warned his Christian
counterparts, ``Thanks to your democratic laws, we will invade you;
thanks to our religious laws, we will dominate you.'' He also cited
instances of Muslim death threats against nuns and criticized
interfaith meetings as a ``dialogue of the deaf.''
</P>
<P>
   The archbishop's comments, reprinted in the Italian bishops'
newspaper, Avvenire, were denounced by Muslim leaders, and by a few
bishops. ``I fear Christians who don't live in a Christian way in
Muslim countries more than I fear Muslims,'' retorted Giovanni
Martinelli, the bishop of Tripoli.
</P>
<P>
   But some of Bernardini's less alarmist sentiments are echoed by
Catholic leaders involved in dialogue with Muslims. ``Irenicism,''
a term for seeking harmony over contention, pops up often in
Catholic texts about Christian-Islamic dialogue, to describe the
way interfaith discussion tends to stick stubbornly to platitudes.
``The problem is they talk, and we listen, we talk and they listen,
but the most pressing issues are not raised,'' said Father Maurice
Borrmans, dean of The Pontifical Institute of Arab and Islamic
studies in Rome.
</P>
<P>
   The pope directly addressed one of those delicate subjects in
1995, when a mosque was erected in Rome. He said the Holy See
encouraged such signs of religious pluralism, then added, ``It is
unfortunately necessary to point out that in some Islamic
countries, similar signs of religious freedom are lacking.''
Christians, who are increasingly a tiny and shrinking minority in
the Middle East, complain of state-enforced Islamic laws and
cultural attitudes that inhibit their ability to worship freely.
</P>
<P>
   Christian leaders who try to discuss such problems complain that
their overtures are not met with reciprocal efforts _ or even
interest. In an essay reviewing the last 30 years of dialogue,
Borrmans noted ``a certain fundamental disinterest vis-a-vis
everything that is not Muslim, and the certainty of having
everything in the Koran (including a clear vision of real
Christianity!).''
</P>
<P>
   Some Muslim scholars involved in interfaith dialogue concede
that their side is not always equally forthcoming. ``Religion in
the Muslim world is often a source of political power, and no
Islamic leader is ready yet to examine what we do to the others,''
said Nazir U. Khaja, president of the Islamic Information Service
in Los Angeles. ``There is still too much of an us-against-them
mindset.''
</P>
<P>
   On social issues like the family, homosexuality and abortion,
however, the Vatican and Islamic institutions have found common
ground, most notably at the U.N. Conference on Population and
Development in Cairo in 1994, and the 1995 Beijing Conference on
Women.
</P>
<P>
   But there are also limits to Catholic acceptance. In 1986, the
pope sponsored a broad gathering of leaders of all the major
religions at Assisi. It was a groundbreaking assembly, and many
Catholic traditionalists complained at the time that it seemed to
suggest that all religions are equal.
</P>
<P>
   Even Cardinal Josef Ratzinger, head of the Vatican's
Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, seemed to disapprove,
saying, ``This cannot be the model.''
</P>
<P>
   Theologians who go too far in affirming that other religions can
also lead to salvation may fall afoul of the Vatican. After a
French Jesuit, the Rev. Jacques Dupuis, published a book on the
subject, ``Toward a Christian Theology of Religious Pluralism,''
his writings were investigated by Cardinal Ratzinger's office for
signs of heresy.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, the pope delivered the most sweeping papal apology
ever, asking forgiveness for errors of the Roman Catholic Church
committed over the last 2,000 years. The pope referred only
obliquely to the Crusades, asking that Catholics acknowledge past
injustices committed ``in the service of truth, '' but many within
the Vatican worried about how this would be interpreted in the
Muslim world.
</P>
<P>
   The Grand Mufti of Jerusalem responded by saying that he wanted
to hear a more explicit apology for the Crusades when he meets with
the pope in Jerusalem. This caused eyes to roll in Rome, where many
Catholic leaders point out that their Muslim counterparts have
never expressed regret for the way Islamic armies sought to conquer
Europe from the eighth century on.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Muslims already thought we were wrong, so now, we say,
yes, in some cases we were wrong,'' Father Borrmans said. ``Of
course it's difficult, but the pope has decided that we must have
the courage to say it.''

colleagues about the perils of Islam. He cited an interfaith
meeting he attended where, he said, a Muslim warned his Christian
counterparts, ``Thanks to your democratic laws, we will invade you;
thanks to our religious laws, we will dominate you.'' He also cited
instances of Muslim death threats against nuns and criticized
interfaith meetings as a ``dialogue of the deaf.''
</P>
<P>
   The archbishop's comments, reprinted in the Italian bishops'
newspaper, Avvenire, were denounced by Muslim leaders, and by a few
bishops. ``I fear Christians who don't live in a Christian way in
Muslim countries more than I fear Muslims,'' retorted Giovanni
Martinelli, the bishop of Tripoli.
</P>
<P>
   But some of Bernardini's less alarmist sentiments are echoed by
Catholic leaders involved in dialogue with Muslims. ``Irenicism,''
a term for seeking harmony over contention, pops up often in
Catholic texts about Christian-Islamic dialogue, to describe the
way interfaith discussion tends to stick stubbornly to platitudes.
``The problem is they talk, and we listen, we talk and they listen,
but the most pressing issues are not raised,'' said Father Maurice
Borrmans, dean of The Pontifical Institute of Arab and Islamic
studies in Rome.
</P>
<P>
   The pope directly addressed one of those delicate subjects in
1995, when a mosque was erected in Rome. He said the Holy See
encouraged such signs of religious pluralism, then added, ``It is
unfortunately necessary to point out that in some Islamic
countries, similar signs of religious freedom are lacking.''
Christians, who are increasingly a tiny and shrinking minority in
the Middle East, complain of state-enforced Islamic laws and
cultural attitudes that inhibit their ability to worship freely.
</P>
<P>
   Christian leaders who try to discuss such problems complain that
their overtures are not met with reciprocal efforts _ or even
interest. In an essay reviewing the last 30 years of dialogue,
Borrmans noted ``a certain fundamental disinterest vis-a-vis
everything that is not Muslim, and the certainty of having
everything in the Koran (including a clear vision of real
Christianity!).''
</P>
<P>
   Some Muslim scholars involved in interfaith dialogue concede
that their side is not always equally forthcoming. ``Religion in
the Muslim world is often a source of political power, and no
Islamic leader is ready yet to examine what we do to the others,''
said Nazir U. Khaja, president of the Islamic Information Service
in Los Angeles. ``There is still too much of an us-against-them
mindset.''
</P>
<P>
   On social issues like the family, homosexuality and abortion,
however, the Vatican and Islamic institutions have found common
ground, most notably at the U.N. Conference on Population and
Development in Cairo in 1994, and the 1995 Beijing Conference on
Women.
</P>
<P>
   But there are also limits to Catholic acceptance. In 1986, the
pope sponsored a broad gathering of leaders of all the major
religions at Assisi. It was a groundbreaking assembly, and many
Catholic traditionalists complained at the time that it seemed to
suggest that all religions are equal.
</P>
<P>
   Even Cardinal Josef Ratzinger, head of the Vatican's
Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, seemed to disapprove,
saying, ``This cannot be the model.''
</P>
<P>
   Theologians who go too far in affirming that other religions can
also lead to salvation may fall afoul of the Vatican. After a
French Jesuit, the Rev. Jacques Dupuis, published a book on the
subject, ``Toward a Christian Theology of Religious Pluralism,''
his writings were investigated by Cardinal Ratzinger's office for
signs of heresy.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, the pope delivered the most sweeping papal apology
ever, asking forgiveness for errors of the Roman Catholic Church
committed over the last 2,000 years. The pope referred only
obliquely to the Crusades, asking that Catholics acknowledge past
injustices committed ``in the service of truth, '' but many within
the Vatican worried about how this would be interpreted in the
Muslim world.
</P>
<P>
   The Grand Mufti of Jerusalem responded by saying that he wanted
to hear a more explicit apology for the Crusades when he meets with
the pope in Jerusalem. This caused eyes to roll in Rome, where many
Catholic leaders point out that their Muslim counterparts have
never expressed regret for the way Islamic armies sought to conquer
Europe from the eighth century on.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Muslims already thought we were wrong, so now, we say,
yes, in some cases we were wrong,'' Father Borrmans said. ``Of
course it's difficult, but the pope has decided that we must have
the courage to say it.''

   Here are today's top news stories from The New York Times News
Service for AMs of Sunday, March 19:
</P>
<P>
   THE TAIWAN ELECTION:
</P>
<P>
   (Coded i)
</P>
<P>
   TAIWAN-ELECTION (Taipei) _ Chen Shui-bian, an opposition
politician who has long advocated Taiwan's independence, was
elected its new president Saturday, ending more than half a century
of Nationalist rule and risking dangerous new tensions with
mainland China. By Erik Eckholm.
</P>
<P>
   TAIWAN-CHEN (Taipei, Taiwan) _ For many Taiwanese, not least
those who swept him to victory Saturday and ended over 50 years of
rule by the Nationalist party, President-elect Chen Shui-bian's
public image was fixed by a supremely personal tragedy. At a rally
in 1985, his wife, Wu Shu-jen, was hit by a truck; the accident
left her paralyzed from the chest down. Ever since, Chen has
carried the reputation as a man who paid a high price, and
shoulders a heavy burden, for his beliefs. By Mark Landler.
</P>
<P>
   TAIWAN-VOTERS (Taipei) _ The mood in the current president's
hometown. By Mark Landler.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   TRADE-GEPHARDT (Washington) _ Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri,
the House Democratic leader and a hard-liner on foreign trade, is
an unlikely kingmaker for a decisive China trade deal that he fears
could jeopardize his greater goal of reclaiming the House this
fall. He is walking a political tightrope as Congress debates
whether to grant China permanent normal trading privileges. By Eric
Schmitt.
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN-RED-ARMY (Tokyo) _ Four Japanese Red Army members
suspected of hijackings, embassy seizures and other crimes were
taken into custody upon entering Japan on Saturday after being
deported from Lebanon. By Howard W. French.
</P>
<P>
   SAFRICA-AIDS (Johannesburg, South Africa) _ President Thabo
Mbeki's decision to seek advice from two Americans who argue that
HIV does not cause AIDS has touched off an outcry at home and
abroad and raised fears that South Africa's already soaring
infection rate will climb still further. By Rachel L. Swarns.
</P>
<P>
   POPE-JERUSALEM (Jerusalem) _ Pope John Paul II's pilgrimage to
the holy land is a deeply spiritual climax of a 22-year papacy and
the first official visit of a pope to Israel. But it is also the
culmination of John Paul's long effort to redefine the way the
church sees Jews _ as ``elder brothers'' rather than traitors _ and
to reconcile Jews and Catholics. By Deborah Sontag.

just a week away, Acting President Vladimir Putin sought to

close and that some Russian troops would soon be on their way home.
By Michael R. Gordon.

   INDIA-ECON-GAP (Hyderabad, India) _ President Clinton will see
the new modern cyber-India, but the chasm between India's educated

economists, politicians and some leading software entrepreneurs. By

   PRISON-LABOR (Otay Mesa, Calif.) _ With unemployment low and a
record number of Americans behind bars, prison labor is coming to
mean much more than painting license plates. As inmates undertake
everything from telemarketing to the manufacturing of computer
circuit boards and furniture, the change has caused a growing
debate over the role the nation's 2 million prisoners should play
in its economy. By David Leonhardt.
</P>
<P>
   RECRUITING-WORKERS (Kansas City) _ Unable to find enough workers
in the booming economy, corporate America is seeking to expand the
labor pool, trying to attract people not previously recruited so
intensively. To get these new workers, companies are offering all
sorts of lures _ except significantly higher pay. By Louis
Uchitelle.
</P>
<P>
   MOVIE-AUDIENCES (Hollywood) _ As Hollywood prepares for the 72nd
annual Academy Awards next Sunday, there is a growing sense among
many filmmakers and movie professionals that something exciting and
unexpected has happened to American moviemaking over the last
half-decade and with increasing force in the last year: a
fundamental shift in the taste of the mainstream movie audience. By
Rick Lyman.
</P>
<P>
   NUNS-SAINT (Bensalem, Pa.) _ For the Sisters of the Blessed

abortion in a negative light. By Evelyn Nieves.
</P>
<P>
   With photos.
</P>
<P>
   PROVIDENCE-SCANDAL (Providence, R.I.) _ It's a tale out of ``The
Sopranos,'' a saga of official and unofficial corruption at all
levels that culminated on Friday in a guilty verdict against city
tax officials, a sting the feds called ``Operation Plunder Dome.''
But even the verdict doesn't end the city's suspense. The real talk
in Providence, many people say, is whether federal investigators
will bring down the mayor, a convicted felon who is the driving
force behind the city's much-trumpeted renaissance. By Carey
Goldberg.
</P>
<P>
   SUBPRIME-LENDERS (Undated) _ Chicago and other cities are taking
action to thwart predatory lending corporations on the heels of the
Times/ABC report on deceptive practices by large home-equity
lenders like First Alliance. By Diana B. Henriques.
</P>
<P>
   FLA-VOUCHERS-ASSESS (Undated) _ When a Florida judge declared
last week that giving students taxpayer-financed vouchers for
private-school tuition violated that state's Constitution, he
bulldozed an important national testing ground for school choice
and posted a reminder that the legal landscape for vouchers
included several potential pitfalls. By Jodi Wilgoren.
</P>
<P>
   ASIAN-BABY-BOOM (New York) _ Millennium, schmillennium. It's the
Year of the Dragon, baby. And among Asian-Americans who abide by
the lunar calendar, this auspicious season of the mythical beast is
also turning out to be the year of the baby boom. By Somini
Sengupta.
</P>
<P>
   ALASKA-AIRLINES (Seattle) _ After 64 mechanics at Alaska
Airlines signed a letter saying they had been ``pressured,
threatened and intimidated'' to cut corners on repairs and
maintenance, the airline put one of its managers on administrative
leave and said Saturday that it was conducting detailed interviews
with all of the mechanics. By Sam Howe Verhovek.

   HMO-MEDICARE (Washington) _ Exclusive: Medicare officials say
HMOs have disseminated false information in an effort to mobilize
their members to lobby Congress, and federal investigators say they
have found evidence that HMOs bill Medicare for some of their
lobbying expenses. By Robert Pear.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   LONGHORNED-BEETLE (Washington) _ Federal, state and local

of trees in the New York City and Chicago areas since arriving in
the United States just a few years ago. By David Stout.

<P>
   (Coded p)
</P>
<P>
   GORE-HAMMER (Carthage, Tenn.) _ On the third page of Vice
President Al Gore's most recent financial disclosure report,
following routine listings for his salary and the value of his
house in Washington and his small farm here, is a provocative
entry: $20,000 for leasing land for zinc mining. Behind the yearly
lease payment, which has earned Gore about $450,000 since 1974, is
the story of a sweetheart land deal from long ago, and the unusual
ties between the vice president and his family and the late
millionaire Armand Hammer and his oil company, Occidental
Petroleum. By Douglas Frantz.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH-SYMBOLISM (Austin, Texas) _ At the celebration here after
Gov. George W. Bush all but clinched the Republican presidential
nomination, the person chosen to introduce Bush was not some
longtime Republican bigwig or starry political celebrity. It was
Mayor Carlos Ramirez of El Paso, a Hispanic Democrat. The move was
clearly part of the Bush campaign's attempt to portray the governor
as eager to embrace diversity and intent on broadening the
Republican party's appeal. By Frank Bruni.
</P>
<P>
   SENATE-ELECTION (Washington) _ This year's Senate elections seem
likely to produce modest Democratic gains, but too small to take
control from the Republicans, leaders of both parties agree. Both
sides will be watching the outcome closely, because it probably
will set the stage for an even more intense fight for control in
2002. By Adam Clymer.

<P>
   LONDON _ It is 12:30 p.m. and I am riding the stationary bicycle
at the LivingWell health club, a moderately priced gym a stone's
throw from Parliament, in London's (smaller, dinkier) approximation
of Capitol Hill. This is prime time for exercise, when urbanites
everywhere spend their lunch hours crunching and toning so as to
look as lean and hungry as urbanites everywhere are supposed to.
</P>
<P>
   But not at this gym. On the treadmill next to me is a man in an
old gray t-shirt with his stomach hanging down over his too-tight
shorts and a face so red and sweaty that he looks like he might
well not survive into the evening. Over at the free weights is a
woman, wobbly in a retro-style leotard, whose concept of ``reps''
is to heave one of the weights over her head, let gravity pull it
back to the ground, and then rest for a while.
</P>
<P>
   In the pool, which is not divided into lanes because people
don't generally swim laps in it, are several women of various
shapes and sizes who do the breast stroke for a few minutes. Then
they sit in the whirlpool. Then they go home.
</P>
<P>
   When I joined the gym two years ago, it was with a heavy heart.
I am all too familiar with New York health clubs, the ones with the
people elbowing you in aerobics class, the peak-hour time limits on
the rowing machines, all those scary fat-free exercisers with their
sports drinks and their weight belts and their puffing and
pulse-counting. One of the gyms I went to had a sign up next to the
pool, to remind you not to viciously kick your fellow swimmers.
``Swimming laps is not a competitive sport,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   But when I arrived at LivingWell for my first session, I was in
for a shock. Although I hadn't exercised in months and could only
manage about 15 sit-ups at a stretch, that seemed to be at the high
end of the spectrum, among this particular crowd. Some of the
members were presumably there for the purpose of getting into
shape, but the general definition of ``in shape'' seemed a loose
and impressionistic one.
</P>
<P>
   This was a gym where, when you go to the ``Buns and Abs''
exercise class, people actually compete to stand in the back of the
room, as far away from the mirrors as possible _ the reverse of the
classic New York scenario, where people secretly hope you will
injure yourself so they can take your spot up front.
</P>
<P>
   It was a gym where even at the busiest times, there was always
at least one empty StairMaster (sometimes all of them are empty).
It was a gym many of whose members look as if they had never
actually set foot inside a gym, even when they are in fact inside.
</P>
<P>
   There are gyms with less-lackadaisical clientele in London, gyms
where young, buff investment bankers in bicycle shorts sweat and
strut as if they worked on Wall Street and were members of the New
York Health and Racquet Club. But they are much fewer and farther
between, with a higher proportion of body-conscious foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   Real Britons, it seems, go to gyms like mine, to the extent that
they go at all.
</P>
<P>
   If asked, most Britons would freely confess that they don't care
much about their buns, or their abs. They don't enjoy admiring
their aerobicized selves in full-length mirrors (there are no
full-length mirrors in the remarkably comfort-free LivingWell
changing room, anyway).
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   And, in general, they don't want to give up the sort of habits
that would upset the U.S. surgeon general.
</P>
<P>
   More than a quarter of them smoke. If they eat a vegetable with
their meat, which is not always the case, they are likely to
smother it in butter. And if they eat fish, they are likely to eat
it deep-fried in batter, with a generous helping of French fries on
the side.
</P>
<P>
   Just as it is no surprise that many Americans are clinically
obese, it is no surprise that by many standards, Britons are
stunningly unhealthy, and proud of it. Although they have a
universal health care system and relatively high average life
spans, they also have a yen for Scotch eggs _ deep-fried
hard-boiled eggs covered in bread crumbs and pork bits. Although
they like to go for long walks in the rain, they also spend an
average of 25 hours a week watching television. (Americans watch
about 26 hours a week).
</P>
<P>
   They enjoy baked beans on their baked potatoes, and drink an
average of 11 alcoholic drinks a week. And while one in four will
get cancer at some point in their lives, they seem to spend a
curiously small amount of time worrying about it.
</P>
<P>
   Only 11 percent of the population has private health insurance,
and the rest take pot luck with the National Health Service _ a
system which can be wonderful and can be atrocious, and which does
not provide regular physicals.
</P>
<P>
   Teeth? Don't even think about it. Fluoride is a thorny political
issue in Britain. Many people regard it as an unwarranted
governmental intrusion into private life, and as a result, only 10
percent of the population lives in an area where the drinking water
is fluoridated.
</P>
<P>
   By way of illustrating how the country's dental health is
improving, the British Dental Association recently announced that
only 13 percent of British adults have no teeth at all, down from
28 percent in 1979. (Of those with one or more teeth, though, only
50 percent visit their dentists regularly).
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   On a recent trip back to New York, I went with a friend to the
Reebok Sports Club on Manhattan's Upper West Side, a health club so
bustling and so full of hard-core exercisers that it makes the
weight room at LivingWell look like the physical therapy department
in an orthopedic hospital.
</P>
<P>
   While LivingWell has a breakfast ``buffet'' with a couple of
vats of generic cereal, Reebok has a full-service cafe that sells
health shakes made on the spot with fresh fruit. While the shower
room at LivingWell consists of three showers that smell of mildew,
the shower room at Reebok is a vast complex where each shower is
connected to its own changing room, complete with its own set of
shampoos, creams and the like.
</P>
<P>
   There were no free treadmills.
</P>
<P>
   But as I waited, already agitated as I willed the man ahead of
me to get off the machine, already, I remembered the New York gym
one friend belonged to some years ago, in the heart of Wall Street
and filled with junior bankers with little time to spare between
deals.
</P>
<P>
   If your equipment of choice was occupied, you had to sign up at
the front desk and wait for your turn to be announced over the
loudspeaker. There was something wonderfully apt about a
disembodied voice intoning ``Brent to the treadmill. Brent to the
treadmill,'' as each fledgling executive took his place.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, Brent probably wouldn't wait for the treadmill; he'd
go to the pub instead.

at least one empty StairMaster (sometimes all of them are empty).
It was a gym many of whose members look as if they had never
actually set foot inside a gym, even when they are in fact inside.
</P>
<P>
   There are gyms with less-lackadaisical clientele in London, gyms
where young, buff investment bankers in bicycle shorts sweat and
strut as if they worked on Wall Street and were members of the New
York Health and Racquet Club. But they are much fewer and farther
between, with a higher proportion of body-conscious foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   Real Britons, it seems, go to gyms like mine, to the extent that
they go at all.
</P>
<P>
   If asked, most Britons would freely confess that they don't care
much about their buns, or their abs. They don't enjoy admiring
their aerobicized selves in full-length mirrors (there are no
full-length mirrors in the remarkably comfort-free LivingWell
changing room, anyway).
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   And, in general, they don't want to give up the sort of habits
that would upset the U.S. surgeon general.
</P>
<P>
   More than a quarter of them smoke. If they eat a vegetable with
their meat, which is not always the case, they are likely to
smother it in butter. And if they eat fish, they are likely to eat
it deep-fried in batter, with a generous helping of French fries on
the side.
</P>
<P>
   Just as it is no surprise that many Americans are clinically
obese, it is no surprise that by many standards, Britons are
stunningly unhealthy, and proud of it. Although they have a
universal health care system and relatively high average life
spans, they also have a yen for Scotch eggs _ deep-fried
hard-boiled eggs covered in bread crumbs and pork bits. Although
they like to go for long walks in the rain, they also spend an
average of 25 hours a week watching television. (Americans watch
about 26 hours a week).
</P>
<P>
   They enjoy baked beans on their baked potatoes, and drink an
average of 11 alcoholic drinks a week. And while one in four will
get cancer at some point in their lives, they seem to spend a
curiously small amount of time worrying about it.
</P>
<P>
   Only 11 percent of the population has private health insurance,
and the rest take pot luck with the National Health Service _ a
system which can be wonderful and can be atrocious, and which does
not provide regular physicals.
</P>
<P>
   Teeth? Don't even think about it. Fluoride is a thorny political
issue in Britain. Many people regard it as an unwarranted
governmental intrusion into private life, and as a result, only 10
percent of the population lives in an area where the drinking water
is fluoridated.
</P>
<P>
   By way of illustrating how the country's dental health is
improving, the British Dental Association recently announced that
only 13 percent of British adults have no teeth at all, down from
28 percent in 1979. (Of those with one or more teeth, though, only
50 percent visit their dentists regularly).

   On a recent trip back to New York, I went with a friend to the
Reebok Sports Club on Manhattan's Upper West Side, a health club so
bustling and so full of hard-core exercisers that it makes the
weight room at LivingWell look like the physical therapy department
in an orthopedic hospital.
</P>
<P>
   While LivingWell has a breakfast ``buffet'' with a couple of
vats of generic cereal, Reebok has a full-service cafe that sells
health shakes made on the spot with fresh fruit. While the shower
room at LivingWell consists of three showers that smell of mildew,
the shower room at Reebok is a vast complex where each shower is
connected to its own changing room, complete with its own set of
shampoos, creams and the like.
</P>
<P>
   There were no free treadmills.
</P>
<P>
   But as I waited, already agitated as I willed the man ahead of
me to get off the machine, already, I remembered the New York gym
one friend belonged to some years ago, in the heart of Wall Street
and filled with junior bankers with little time to spare between
deals.
</P>
<P>
   If your equipment of choice was occupied, you had to sign up at
the front desk and wait for your turn to be announced over the
loudspeaker. There was something wonderfully apt about a
disembodied voice intoning ``Brent to the treadmill. Brent to the
treadmill,'' as each fledgling executive took his place.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, Brent probably wouldn't wait for the treadmill; he'd
go to the pub instead.

AS PRISON WORK PROGRAMS GROW, SO DOES DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DAVID LEONHARDT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OTAY MESA, Calif. _ Behind five barbed-wire fences, four
identification checkpoints, two guard towers and one 50,000-volt
electric fence sits one of the few remaining solutions to America's
tightest labor market in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Every weekday, some 100 prisoners report for work at one of
three private companies here at the Richard J. Donovan Correctional
Facility, a series of squat buildings hidden among the hills at the
base of Otay Mountain, just 5 miles from the Mexican border. The
men, convicted murderers and robbers among them, stitch T-shirts,
recycle tires and make wine and beer vats.
</P>
<P>
   Other than the workers' uniformly blue outfits and the armed
guards who occasionally patrol the factory floors, the workplace
looks quite normal. A radio plays the Beatles' ``Here Comes the
Sun.'' Hunched over sewing machines or welding together stainless
steel vats, the men earn about $5.75 an hour, the California
minimum wage. The products end up in trendy clothing stores and
upscale brew pubs.
</P>
<P>
   With unemployment low and a record number of Americans behind
bars, prison labor is coming to mean much more than painting
license plates. As inmates undertake everything from telemarketing
to the manufacturing of computer circuit boards and furniture, the
change has caused a growing debate, playing out in state
legislatures and in two bills before Congress, over the role the
nation's 2 million prisoners should play in its economy.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, more than 80,000 inmates now hold
traditional jobs, working for governments or private companies and
earning 25 cents to $7 an hour. The private sector programs, which
exist in 36 states and employ 3,500, have doubled in size since
1995 after years of almost no growth. And the federal program that
employs 21,000 inmates, up 14 percent in the last two years, and
that has $600 million in annual sales, is seeking to expand.
</P>
<P>
   Both supporters and opponents agree the debate is at a critical
juncture because employment in prisons could spread quickly in the
coming years. On virtually every other question, however _ whether
prison labor helps inmates or is cruel to them, whether it is an
economic benefit or a force holding down wages _ the two sides
differ vehemently.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the employment of inmates include law enforcement
officials who view the programs as a way to reform convicts and
business groups who see inexpensive labor. Many prisoners want to
work, the backers say, noting that research has shown that inmates
who work are less likely to commit crimes when they are released.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a problem for corrections officers to have prisoners
without anything constructive to do,'' said Edwin Meese, the former
U.S. attorney general, who lobbies for expanded inmate labor as
chairman of the Enterprise Prison Institute, a Bethesda, Md.,
research group financed by state grants, research centers and
private companies.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, supporters say, prisoners offer the ultimate in a
flexible and dependable work force. ``If I lay them off for a
week,'' said Pierre Sleiman, the owner of the T-shirt company at
Donovan, referring to his workers, ``I don't have to worry about
someone else coming and saying, `Come work for me.'''
</P>
<P>
   To opponents, inmate labor is both a potential human rights
abuse and a threat to workers outside prison walls. Inmates have no
bargaining power and are easily exploited, the critics say. In one
California lawsuit, for example, two prisoners have sued both their
employer and the prison, saying they were put in solitary
confinement after complaining about working conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The opponents also say the programs have stolen jobs from
outside workers and hold down wages for other workers. Inmate
labor, said Gordon Lafer, a political science professor at the
University of Oregon, ``is a decent-sized problem that is poised to
explode.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the companies now in the program are small. Earlier in
the 1990s, big companies like AT&AMP;T and Microsoft hired inmates, but
most backed away after the arrangements were exposed. Some big
companies, like thre retailer Target Corp., still use suppliers
that employ prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Prison labor in the United States has its roots in the 1800s,
when inmates worked for private companies without pay. After
hundreds died on the job because of hazardous conditions, unions
and prison reformers demanded a halt the practice.
</P>
<P>
   In 1934, however, federal prison officials concerned about
growing unrest in prisons lobbied to create a work program.
Companies got involved again in 1979, when Congress passed a law
allowing them to hire prisoners in some circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For most of the last two decades, the programs remained tiny.
But the tough drug and sentencing laws of the 1980s helped increase
the number of Americans behind bars by 80 percent, to 2 million, in
a decade. The unemployment rate, meanwhile, was falling.``Now the
economy is very good, and businesses are looking to the prison
system for labor,'' said Noreen Blonien, an assistant director of
the California Department of Corrections.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the federal Bureau of Prisons hope the same logic
will enable them to expand their program, the nation's largest, to
include private-sector jobs like those at Donovan. Rep. Bill
McCollum, R-Fla., has offered a bill that would allow the bureau to
do so, as long as the companies hiring inmates could show they were
not moving existing jobs behind bars. The jobs would also pay more
than the 21 cents to $1.15 an hour that the inmates now in the
program earn.
</P>
<P>
   A competing bill, meanwhile, from Rep. Pete Hoekstra, R-Mich.,
could cause the federal program to scale back by forcing it to
compete with private companies for the government contracts it now
fills.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you end up with, in certain cases, is the federal
government getting inferior products at higher prices, `` said
Hoekstra, who has the support of both the U.S. Chamber of Commerce
and the AFL-CIO.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, the lawmakers' aides have discussed a combined
bill that would both force state-run prison operations to compete
with private enterprises and allow companies to hire federal
inmates. ``We're very close to a compromise,'' McCollum said. If
they cannot reach one, the lawmakers say they will offer their
bills separately.
</P>
<P>
   Away from Washington, the debate over inmates working for
private companies is less hypothetical.
</P>
<P>
   One business employing inmates is CMT Blues, a T-shirt company
here in the southwesternmost corner of the United States, and it
has been home to virtually every argument on both sides of the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, in nearby Chula Vista, Sleiman was running a
business that imported clothing, and he was considering opening his
own operation. He was looking to Honduras, he said, where workers
earn about $1.75 an hour. ``In our industry, all of the business is
going offshore,'' Sleiman said. Then he heard about California's
prison work program. Under it, Sleiman would have to pay the
inmates $5.75 an hour, but he could make up some of the expense
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   For CMT's factory, Sleiman pays less than a fifth of what he
would elsewhere in rent and electricity. He also receives a 25
percent discount on workers' compensation insurance and tax
credits.
</P>
<P>
   The California operation, Sleiman determined, would be cheaper
than operating elsewhere in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But he soon found out that setting up shop in a prison is no
panacea. Delivery and pickup times must be scheduled precisely.
Sleiman also trained many of the workers from scratch, he said.
Then he had to convince them to work together.
</P>
<P>
   ``On paper, it looked very good,'' Sleiman said. In reality, he
added, ``it has been a tough road.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been even tougher for the inmates, according to a lawsuit
filed last summer by two former Donovan prisoners. To work at CMT,
inmates had to go through a 60-day ``training period'' for which
they were not paid, according to the suit. It also says workers
were given unrealistic production quotas and were told to replace
``Made in Honduras'' labels on some fabric with `Made in the USA''
tags.
</P>
<P>
   nn
   
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   After the inmates, Charles Ervin and Shearwood Fleming, got in
touch with a local television show and it broadcast their charges,
they were fired, put in solitary confinement for more than 45 days
and eventually transferred to another prison.
</P>
<P>
   Sleiman said the length of training programs varies, and the
accusations about quotas and the labels were untrue. A California
Department of Corrections investigation into the label-switching
charge was inconclusive, a state spokeswoman said. Prisoners
understood the conditions of the training program when they applied
to work at CMT, she added.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the problems, though, California prison officials said
the private-sector jobs remain far more popular among inmates than
washing sheets or even building government furniture. At most state
prisons where private companies operate, there are waiting lists to
be hired.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we step through the gates and into the shop,'' said Allen
W. Smith, 45, a T-shirt worker who is serving a 13-year sentence
for robbery, ``this is a company. This isn't prison.'' Guards still
keep watch, but the atmosphere differs greatly from prison yards,
the inmates said.
</P>
<P>
   The private sector jobs also pay at least the minimum wage,
although prisoners in most states keep only a fraction of their
pay.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with other jobs at Donovan, ``it's great,'' said Frank
W. Owen, 39, who was convicted of a 1982 murder and has worked for
CMT for four years. ``I've been able to save some money.''
</P>
<P>
   Owen also said he hoped his record at CMT will help him earn
parole.
</P>
<P>
   Sleiman, meanwhile, said CMT was doing better now that he had
learned how to operate in a prison. Over the 18 months, he added,
he plans to triple his work force to 200. &QL;

<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ There's been plenty of talk of war between
China and Taiwan recently, but the oratory obscures a more concrete
calculus _ one based not on missile throw-weight but on dollars and
cents. By that calculus, preparations on both sides of the Taiwan
Strait remain modest and, according to the experts, will most
likely stay that way.
</P>
<P>
   While China has been modestly beefing up its arsenal against
Taiwan in hopes of eventually forcing the island to negotiate
reunification with the mainland, there has been no dramatic
increase in spending that would signal a shift toward a war
economy.
</P>
<P>
   One part of the calculus is that in the long run, China can much
better afford a future arms race than Taiwan, but is not yet
willing to risk the cost to its economic growth. That casts some
light on why China has so far been willing to raise the decibel
level of its threats against Taiwan, without dramatically
increasing its preparations for a shooting war.
</P>
<P>
   Of course China is modernizing its army, as can be expected of a
country its size. But that has been known for some time, and the
pace of that modernization remains slow. There is no concerted
attempt, for example, to build the kind of amphibious fleet that
would be needed to transport an invasion force across the narrow
strait _ a project that could take a decade to complete. And
China's military spending is still only about a tenth of what the
United States spends, or less than 2 percent of the country's gross
domestic product. The Soviet Union, by contrast, spent more than 20
percent of its GDP on defense at the height of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   China has preferred instead to put general economic development
ahead of military development, following Deng Xiaoping's maxim that
national strength derives from the economy rather than the barrel
of a gun. The strategy has served China well in recent years as the
government ramped up infrastructure spending to slow a slide in
economic growth, something it might not have been as free to do had
military spending commanded a larger share of the national budget.
</P>
<P>
   China's military spending has been increasing in recent years _
a sizable ship costs several billion dollars _ but the country is
reluctant to allow its army to grow overly dependent on any outside
supplier, least of all a historically unstable ally such as Russia,
its main source of foreign arms today.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, stepping up domestic arms production would
present problems of its own. China's domestic arms industry has
proven abysmal by most measures in areas other than missile, tank
and artillery production. The country has been working since the
early 1980s to develop a high-tech fighter, the F-10, but has only
recently got prototypes into the air.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say that China isn't seeking to create a genuine
military threat with which to scare Taiwan into serious talks.
Toward this end, the country has bought from Russia two Sovremenny
guided missile destroyers and four diesel electric Kilo-class
submarines. It has bought 48 SU-27 advanced fighter jets and has
begun assembling kits for 200 more. And it has agreed to buy still
more advanced SU-30s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our preparation for war against Taiwan's independence will not
stop, regardless of what happens in Taiwan, because we have to
prepare for the worst situation,'' says Shen Dingli, an arms
control expert at Fudan University here. ``If the U.S. gives Taiwan
more weapons,'' he adds, ``this will fan an arms race, but it is an
arms race China can afford.''
</P>
<P>
   On that count, Shen appears to be right. China could easily
double domestic defense spending without putting an undue strain on
its economy. And its fat foreign reserves, which at $155 billion
are the largest in the world after Japan's, could pay for much of
what China needs from abroad if it wanted to decisively shift the
cross-strait balance of power in its favor.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not something China appears ready to do just yet.
Drawing down reserves would increase the country's cost of foreign
capital, weaken its currency and further delay economic reforms
that depend on eventual convertibility of the yuan. And domestic
weapons spending would widen the country's budget deficit and
divert resources needed to keep the overall economy plugging along.
</P>
<P>
   There are other constraints on accelerating the buildup as well.
</P>
<P>
   Both armies, for example, are already struggling to absorb
sophisticated arms they can't yet use. This means, on both sides of
the strait, that any commitment to new systems stretches out the
time frame for an arms race _ and for investing in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if China did begin a crash program on some systems, which
they haven't begun in my view, it will take at least four to six
years for the new systems to enter the inventory,'' says David
Shambaugh, a specialist on the Chinese military at George
Washington University. He says it will be several years before
China can confidently wield the recently purchased Russian
destroyers in a conflict.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, experts say, China is likely to opt for a far cheaper
and more focused buildup, one that Taiwan will find itself hard
pressed to outrun. Already, the mainland possesses enough
short-range ballistic missiles to overwhelm Taiwan's defenses. That
raises the possibility that the United States might develop a
broader missile defense system and apply it to Taiwan. But then
China could just build more missiles, which cost a fraction of what
it costs to shoot them down.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of the threat of a missile attack, Taiwan has
requested more powerful arms from the United States _ most recently
destroyers equipped with Aegis anti-missile systems and Tomahawk
cruise missiles with a striking range well beyond the width of the
narrow strait. But here the United States may well think twice,
because increasing the weaponry in the strait could increase the
risk of accidental conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, neither side has an air-to-air or cruise missile with a
range of more than 40 miles and that creates a buffer, it gives
them time to think,'' says Larry Wortzel, a retired U.S. Army
colonel and former military attache in Beijing who is now at the
Heritage Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   And given the economic calculus, pushing China into an arms race
is likely only to erode the considerable potential for constructive
political dialogue. That potential is also better understood by
following economic logic, with Taiwanese businesses having invested
more than $40 billion in the mainland and showing interest in
investing more.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, weapons are not going to solve this problem for
either side,'' says Bates Gill, an expert on Chinese weapons at the
Brookings Institution. ``The attention of all sides needs to focus
like a laser beam on the difficult choices of a political answer,
not the easy choices of more weapons and more bluster.''  &QL;

<P>
   But that is not something China appears ready to do just yet.
Drawing down reserves would increase the country's cost of foreign
capital, weaken its currency and further delay economic reforms
that depend on eventual convertibility of the yuan. And domestic
weapons spending would widen the country's budget deficit and
divert resources needed to keep the overall economy plugging along.
</P>
<P>
   There are other constraints on accelerating the buildup as well.
</P>
<P>
   Both armies, for example, are already struggling to absorb
sophisticated arms they can't yet use. This means, on both sides of
the strait, that any commitment to new systems stretches out the
time frame for an arms race _ and for investing in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if China did begin a crash program on some systems, which
they haven't begun in my view, it will take at least four to six
years for the new systems to enter the inventory,'' says David
Shambaugh, a specialist on the Chinese military at George
Washington University. He says it will be several years before
China can confidently wield the recently purchased Russian
destroyers in a conflict.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, experts say, China is likely to opt for a far cheaper
and more focused buildup, one that Taiwan will find itself hard
pressed to outrun. Already, the mainland possesses enough
short-range ballistic missiles to overwhelm Taiwan's defenses. That
raises the possibility that the United States might develop a
broader missile defense system and apply it to Taiwan. But then
China could just build more missiles, which cost a fraction of what
it costs to shoot them down.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of the threat of a missile attack, Taiwan has
requested more powerful arms from the United States _ most recently
destroyers equipped with Aegis anti-missile systems and Tomahawk
cruise missiles with a striking range well beyond the width of the
narrow strait. But here the United States may well think twice,
because increasing the weaponry in the strait could increase the
risk of accidental conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, neither side has an air-to-air or cruise missile with a
range of more than 40 miles and that creates a buffer, it gives
them time to think,'' says Larry Wortzel, a retired U.S. Army
colonel and former military attache in Beijing who is now at the
Heritage Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   And given the economic calculus, pushing China into an arms race
is likely only to erode the considerable potential for constructive
political dialogue. That potential is also better understood by
following economic logic, with Taiwanese businesses having invested
more than $40 billion in the mainland and showing interest in
investing more.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, weapons are not going to solve this problem for
either side,'' says Bates Gill, an expert on Chinese weapons at the
Brookings Institution. ``The attention of all sides needs to focus
like a laser beam on the difficult choices of a political answer,
not the easy choices of more weapons and more bluster.''  &QL;

<P>
   After 21 stressful years of living under clerical dictatorship,
most Iranians would happily settle for a more normal life. But last
week, just as they were celebrating the reformist landslide in
February's parliamentary elections and the hope of a peaceful
progression toward a more democratic society, an assassin's bullet
provided a shocking reminder of how grim and uncertain a struggle
may yet lie ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The hammer blow came when a man dismounted a powerful
motorcycle, walked down a Tehran sidewalk and fired at the head of
Saeed Hajjarian, a 47-year-old newspaper publisher who has been one
of the reform movement's most valued leaders. By the week's end,
Hajjarian was experiencing brief bouts of consciousness in a
hospital, but doctors remained wary of his ever making a full
recovery.
</P>
<P>
   In the search for suspects, many signs pointed toward a core of
ruthless, corrupt, clandestine men in the state security agencies
who work hand-in-glove with the conservative Muslim clerics at the
pinnacle of power. The motorcycle itself was of a kind that only
Iran's security agencies are allowed to use. Then there was the
provocation Hajjarian had offered in his crusading newspaper,
Sobh-e Emrooz, which has done more than any other Iranian
publication to expose the darkness at the heart of Islamic rule.
</P>
<P>
   These exposures have centered on evidence that officially
sanctioned death squads have been at work for years, and
implications that powerful figures in the clerical hierarchy may
have known _ or even approved the killings _ in advance. In the
last few weeks, the revelations, presented in a guarded fashion
that reflected the risks involved, had begun to work closer to the
center of power, hastening, as it now seems, the moment when the
bitter clash between reformers and conservatives could no longer be
finessed.
</P>
<P>
   On the face of things, Iran in recent years has achieved
something remarkable, the gradual advance of democracy within an
Islamic system that, as defended by the conservatives, is inimical
to the very idea of popular sovereignty. A succession of landslide
victories in elections, beginning with the 1997 triumph of the
reformers' main standard-bearer, President Mohammad Khatami and
culminating with the reformist sweep of three-quarters of the seats
in parliamentary elections four weeks ago, had co-existed, however
uneasily, with a system in which clerical hard-liners continued to
hold all critical levers of power.
</P>
<P>
   The principal figures on both sides _ Khatami for the reformers
and Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the country's ``supreme leader,'' for
the conservatives _ seemed determined not to allow the
contradiction to be pushed too far, and certainly not to the point
of a struggle in the streets. But others, like Hajjarian, were
exploiting fissures in the system _ above all, the emergence of an
independent press _ to drive what amounted to a stake into the
system's heart.
</P>
<P>
   Many reformers, Hajjarian among them, came well-equipped to the
task. Khatami was a trusted loyalist of Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini, who led the revolution in 1979. Others, including
Hajjarian, participated in the student takeover of the U.S. embassy
in Tehran, and in the indignities imposed on the U.S. diplomats
held hostage for 15 months.
</P>
<P>
   Hajjarian and others also worked in the Islamic system's
agencies of enforcement _ in his case as a deputy intelligence
minister from 1984 to 1989.
</P>
<P>
   If this has lent credence to the reformers' challenge, it has
added, too, to the bitterness with which their efforts have been
met. Out in the open, major reform figures like Abdullah Nouri were
brought to trial and sentenced to lengthy jail terms, only for
others to carry the baton forward. And more sinister forces have
been at work as well.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 15 months, Hajjarian's paper published exposes of
the intelligence ministry that focused on the murders in late 1998
of five prominent opposition figures. Under pressure from Khatami,
the ministry admitted early last year that ``rogue elements'' in
its own ranks _ a death squad _ had carried out the murders.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the ministry proclaimed the arrest of one of its
deputy ministers as the ``ringleader'' of the death squad, it
reverted to form by announcing that the man, Saeed Emami, had
committed suicide in prison. While rumors circulated of Emami
having died from an injection of potassium cyanide, the ministry
announced the arrest of 26 more people, most from its own ranks.
But none of the others has yet been brought to trial.
</P>
<P>
   Hajjarian's paper did not rest there. In new articles and a
book, the paper's leading investigative reporter, Akbar Gangi, has
suggested that the 1998 murders were a sequel to a long-established
practice of secret killing, authorized, it has been hinted, by a
commission of high-ranking intelligence officials. The murders _ by
potassium cyanide, by knifings, by strangling and by shooting _ are
said to have involved as many as 80 people.
</P>
<P>
   Since the recent elections, Khatami's brother, Mohammed-Reza
Khatami, who led the triumphant reformists, has said they intend to
empanel a parliamentary commission of inquiry into the allegations
and to establish what role, if any, was played in the killings by
the highest-ranking officials of the state. Other reform leaders
have suggested that one of those to be investigated is Khatami's
predecessor as president, Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
   Rafsanjani, a senior cleric himself, has long been an elusive
figure, shifting back and forth between reform and hard-line
policies, and getting rich as he has done so. Significantly, in
light of the new questions about his past, he barely won his own
seat in the elections.
</P>
<P>
   But after the attack on Hajjarian, Iranians are asking
themselves more than ever whether their future will be settled at
the ballot box, or by the darker forces at play. Between reformers
who carry their fight with the searchlight of reason and
disclosure, and hardliners who seem prepared to battle it out with
daggers, the issue seems far from settled. Iranians may have months
or years yet of confrontation before they see their yearning for
broader rights fulfilled.

THE POLITICS OF RACE AND THE CENSUS

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The four words on the census form, ``check all that
apply,'' sound more bureaucratic than revolutionary. Yet when used
in a question asking people to describe their race, those words
represent the latest shake-up in the way the country views itself
racially.
</P>
<P>
   With high levels of immigration, rising rates of intermarriage
and groups clamoring for recognition, America's racial and ethnic
stew is undergoing radical change. Some people say this change
portends the end of whites as the majority race by the middle of
the next century _ a dubious theory at best.
</P>
<P>
   Even if whites retain their numerical dominance, the subtly
changing flavor of the country's racial and ethnic bouillabaisse is
already reflected in the forms the Census Bureau is mailing to more
than 120 million households this month. For the first time, people
can describe themselves as members of one or more of six racial
categories. They can check all that apply. Thus individuals could
list themselves as white or black or white and Asian or black and
white and American Indian and ``other.''
</P>
<P>
   The resulting 63 potential variations have caused confusion
among sociologists and statisticians, provoked consternation among
some civil rights advocates and become the butt of jokes among
late-night comedians. The new categories also raise questions about
how the government will keep track of this new racial and ethnic
mix (and whether it should be classifying people by race at all).
The changes point out an abiding feature of this country's racial
history: when it comes to determining what exactly is a racial
category, politics _ not biology _ is the deciding factor.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando Patterson, a sociologist at Harvard University, said
that Jews, Italians and Irish were once considered separate races.
But as they gained more economic and political power, the larger
society accepted them as white and ethnic. At one point, the census
categorized some blacks according to how many white ancestors they
had. But as state-sanctioned segregation arose, all people of
African descent were classified into one race _ black. ``These are
all basically political decisions,'' Patterson said. ``The census
always just reflects changing attitudes.''
</P>
<P>
   The odyssey of the mixed race category on the census form is
further testament to political forces. The grouping was first
promoted by officials in the Office of Management and Budget, which
sets policy on racial classifications. They were moved by the
heartfelt stories of parents whose children were forced to select
either the race of the father or of the mother. In response, the
officials initially proposed a new category, ``multiracial.'' Civil
rights organizations were aghast, fearing that the grouping would
dilute the numbers of blacks, Asians-Americans or American Indians.
They worried that smaller figures would make it harder to show
discrimination patterns and to draw legislative districts where
minorities constitute the majority of voters.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, said Karen Narasaki, executive director of the
National Asian Pacific American Legal Consortium, the civil rights
groups ``won less on the strength of our intellectual arguments,
and more on our political strength. OMB backed down.''
</P>
<P>
   When the budget office said that instead of a multiracial
category, people could check more than one racial category, civil
rights groups put enough pressure on the Clinton administration
that the OMB announced last week that people who list themselves as
part white and part minority will be counted as a member of that
minority group.
</P>
<P>
   Civil rights groups did not relish this battle. Many readily
admit that the issue pulls them between two contending beliefs:
self-determination and their view of a way to fight discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Discrimination is not about who you think you are,'' Narasaki
said. ``I could run around thinking I'm white. Many Asians do. Does
that help them in the end? Not always because other people say,
`No, you're not.'''
</P>
<P>
   Still the swirl of categories and politics has prompted calls
for the federal government to stop grouping people by race and
ethnicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're back to the `one drop' rule,'' said Michael Lind, a
senior fellow with the New America Foundation, referring to the old
segregationist rule of thumb that designated people with scant
black blood as black. ``I'm disgusted with the whole thing. This
census should have been the first one not to identify people by
race. Mexico got rid of its racial classifications in the 1820s. We
keep ours basically because of the black civil rights lobby, which
has lobbied in favor of the `one drop' rule.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, whether people like it or not, America's racial mix is
shifting, primarily because of rising rates of intermarriage.
</P>
<P>
   Census figures in 1960 show that there were about 149,000
interracial marriages, generally between whites and blacks, whites
and Asians, and whites and Indians. In 1990 there were more than
1.46 million. Experts say the numbers have risen even faster during
the last decade. The figures do not include marriages between
non-Hispanic whites and Hispanics, which have grown rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   The experts have estimated that in 1990 among young native-born
Hispanic women, 31.4 percent have non-Hispanic white husbands and
that among young Hispanic men, 31.6 have non-Hispanic white wives.
The figures are even higher for Asians where 45.2 percent of
native-born women and 36 percent of native-born men have white
spouses.
</P>
<P>
   But intermarriage is far less common for blacks. In contrast
only about 8 percent of black men and 4 percent of black women
marry outside their race.
</P>
<P>
   Lind sees a new racial divide appearing: on one side, blacks; on
the other non-blacks, which would include whites and the offspring
of whites and other racial and ethnic minorities. What that will
mean in terms of solidarity among people of color and for the
aspirations of African-Americans is anyone's guess.
</P>
<P>
   Still others like Patterson see an even more nuanced trend
emerging: the Census Bureau's dress rehearsal for the 2000 Census
held last year in Sacramento, Calif., and rural counties in South
Carolina found that intermarriage rates among blacks and whites
were far lower in South Carolina than in California where Hispanics
and Asians are much more prevalent and marrying whites in large
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson said that in areas like the Northeast, the Southwest
and West Coast where there has been more immigration tests show
that a new racial amalgam that includes blacks will emerge, while
other sections like the South and the Midwest will be left behind.
``Certain parts of the country are going to become bastions of the
`one drop' rule,'' he said.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The four words on the census form, ``check all that
apply,'' sound more bureaucratic than revolutionary. Yet when used
in a question asking people to describe their race, those words
represent the latest shake-up in the way the country views itself
racially.
</P>
<P>
   With high levels of immigration, rising rates of intermarriage
and groups clamoring for recognition, America's racial and ethnic
stew is undergoing radical change. Some people say this change
portends the end of whites as the majority race by the middle of
the next century _ a dubious theory at best.
</P>
<P>
   Even if whites retain their numerical dominance, the subtly
changing flavor of the country's racial and ethnic bouillabaisse is
already reflected in the forms the Census Bureau is mailing to more
than 120 million households this month. For the first time, people
can describe themselves as members of one or more of six racial
categories. They can check all that apply. Thus individuals could
list themselves as white or black or white and Asian or black and
white and American Indian and ``other.''
</P>
<P>
   The resulting 63 potential variations have caused confusion
among sociologists and statisticians, provoked consternation among
some civil rights advocates and become the butt of jokes among
late-night comedians. The new categories also raise questions about
how the government will keep track of this new racial and ethnic
mix (and whether it should be classifying people by race at all).
The changes point out an abiding feature of this country's racial
history: when it comes to determining what exactly is a racial
category, politics _ not biology _ is the deciding factor.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando Patterson, a sociologist at Harvard University, said
that Jews, Italians and Irish were once considered separate races.
But as they gained more economic and political power, the larger
society accepted them as white and ethnic. At one point, the census
categorized some blacks according to how many white ancestors they
had. But as state-sanctioned segregation arose, all people of
African descent were classified into one race _ black. ``These are
all basically political decisions,'' Patterson said. ``The census
always just reflects changing attitudes.''
</P>
<P>
   The odyssey of the mixed race category on the census form is
further testament to political forces. The grouping was first
promoted by officials in the Office of Management and Budget, which
sets policy on racial classifications. They were moved by the
heartfelt stories of parents whose children were forced to select
either the race of the father or of the mother. In response, the
officials initially proposed a new category, ``multiracial.'' Civil
rights organizations were aghast, fearing that the grouping would
dilute the numbers of blacks, Asians-Americans or American Indians.
They worried that smaller figures would make it harder to show
discrimination patterns and to draw legislative districts where
minorities constitute the majority of voters.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, said Karen Narasaki, executive director of the
National Asian Pacific American Legal Consortium, the civil rights
groups ``won less on the strength of our intellectual arguments,
and more on our political strength. OMB backed down.''
</P>
<P>
   When the budget office said that instead of a multiracial
category, people could check more than one racial category, civil
rights groups put enough pressure on the Clinton administration
that the OMB announced last week that people who list themselves as
part white and part minority will be counted as a member of that
minority group.
</P>
<P>
   Civil rights groups did not relish this battle. Many readily
admit that the issue pulls them between two contending beliefs:
self-determination and their view of a way to fight discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Discrimination is not about who you think you are,'' Narasaki
said. ``I could run around thinking I'm white. Many Asians do. Does
that help them in the end? Not always because other people say,
`No, you're not.'''
</P>
<P>
   Still the swirl of categories and politics has prompted calls
for the federal government to stop grouping people by race and
ethnicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're back to the `one drop' rule,'' said Michael Lind, a
senior fellow with the New America Foundation, referring to the old
segregationist rule of thumb that designated people with scant
black blood as black. ``I'm disgusted with the whole thing. This
census should have been the first one not to identify people by
race. Mexico got rid of its racial classifications in the 1820s. We
keep ours basically because of the black civil rights lobby, which
has lobbied in favor of the `one drop' rule.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, whether people like it or not, America's racial mix is
shifting, primarily because of rising rates of intermarriage.
</P>
<P>
   Census figures in 1960 show that there were about 149,000
interracial marriages, generally between whites and blacks, whites
and Asians, and whites and Indians. In 1990 there were more than
1.46 million. Experts say the numbers have risen even faster during
the last decade. The figures do not include marriages between
non-Hispanic whites and Hispanics, which have grown rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   The experts have estimated that in 1990 among young native-born
Hispanic women, 31.4 percent have non-Hispanic white husbands and
that among young Hispanic men, 31.6 have non-Hispanic white wives.
The figures are even higher for Asians where 45.2 percent of
native-born women and 36 percent of native-born men have white
spouses.
</P>
<P>
   But intermarriage is far less common for blacks. In contrast
only about 8 percent of black men and 4 percent of black women
marry outside their race.
</P>
<P>
   Lind sees a new racial divide appearing: on one side, blacks; on
the other non-blacks, which would include whites and the offspring
of whites and other racial and ethnic minorities. What that will
mean in terms of solidarity among people of color and for the
aspirations of African-Americans is anyone's guess.
</P>

GAS GUZZLERS: LOOKING FOR THE SUV VOTE

<P>
   DETROIT _ Car drivers probably feel avenged these days when they
see a hulking sport utility vehicle lumber up to a gas station.
Every bing and clank from the pump is another reminder of the
higher cost of filling a gas guzzler: up to $70 for the biggest
models.
</P>
<P>
   But any feelings of revenge, or sympathy, may be misplaced.
Higher gas prices actually hurt car owners as much _ or more _ than
sport utility owners, at least when measured as a percentage of
their incomes. Even as gas prices have cleared $1.50 across much of
the country this winter and are approaching $2 a gallon in some
cities, sales of these light trucks continue to grow slightly
faster than car sales.
</P>
<P>
   Just as soccer moms developed into a political constituency,
truckers and motorists hurt by high fuel costs might emerge as
voters candidates have to woo. But motorists' enthusiasm for lower
gas prices may have more to do with the percentage of their incomes
spent on gas than with their vehicles' fuel efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   To paraphrase loosely Ernest Hemingway's riposte to F. Scott
Fitzgerald's famous comment about rich people, sport utility
vehicle owners are not like everybody else: they have more money.
The income gap between buyers of sport utilities and buyers of cars
is greater than the gap in the fuel economy of their vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Consider, for example, a Chevrolet Suburban and a Ford Taurus
mid-size sedan. The Suburban burns 53 percent more gas a year than
the Taurus when driven the same number of miles _ 15 miles a gallon
compared with 23 miles a gallon for the Taurus for a combination of
city and highway driving. But the typical household buying a
Suburban can afford the extra gas because it earns 75 percent more
than a typical household buying a Taurus ($94,700 for the Suburban
to $54,100 for the Taurus, according to the auto makers' survey).
</P>
<P>
   Put another way, even with gas prices up by 60 cents a gallon
over the last year, a family that drives a late-model Suburban for
12,000 miles a year can probably afford the $480 increase in its
gas bill. The family that drives a Taurus the same distance may
wince at the $313 increase. And the difference between $313 and
$480 is not likely to change many people's minds about what models
they buy.
</P>
<P>
   There is little sign so far that buying habits have changed,
perhaps because gas prices are still not that high. Adjusted for
inflation, the price of gas is still below the peak in 1981, when
it reached the equivalent of $2.46 today.
</P>
<P>
   Small cars have better mileage but even less-affluent owners. A
Ford Expedition sport utility vehicle burns 93 percent more gas
than a Dodge Neon driven the same number of miles. Yet a median
household buying a new Expedition also earns 118 percent more than
a Neon-buying household. The income gap is even more extreme for
luxury sport utilities like the Lexus LX470, for which the median
household income is $264,600.
</P>
<P>
   So grousing by sport utility owners about gas prices is mostly
just talk, auto analysts say. ``They may complain about it to their
friends because it's the thing to do,'' said Chris Cedergren, an
auto consultant at Nextrend Inc. in Thousand Oaks, Calif. ``But do
they do anything about it? No.''
</P>
<P>
   Affluent families historically have switched to more
fuel-efficient cars only when gas is in short supply and there are
long lines at service stations. Higher prices, by themselves, have
had little effect. Cadillac sales briefly stumbled when there were
gas lines in early 1974, but completely recovered once the lines
disappeared _ even though gasoline cost four times as much as
before. What hurt Detroit was that sales of non-luxury large cars
did not recover, as middle-class families switched to smaller, more
fuel-efficient Japanese cars.
</P>
<P>
   If today's higher oil prices lead to a recession, a stock market
crash or much higher interest rates, as has sometimes happened in
the past, then the auto industry and sales of SUVs will be
devastated. Even without such a calamity, higher gas prices might
prompt a few of the less prosperous families who buy sport
utilities to switch to more fuel-efficient alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans, including Gov. George W. Bush of Texas this
year and former Sen. Bob Dole during the 1996 presidential
campaign, have sought the repeal of the 4.3-cent federal gas tax
increase enacted in 1993. But Robert Teeter, a Republican pollster,
said Republicans should criticize President Clinton for not
pursuing energy independence instead of worrying about small gas
taxes. Affluent families who might consider voting Republican are
not going to be swayed by a few pennies, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``SUV drivers are not so sensitive to a 20- or 30-percent change
in gas prices as someone on a limited income,'' Teeter said. ``The
guy who is really hurt is the one driving the 15- or 18-year-old
car.''
</P>
<P>
   And the driver of such a clunker, he added, is probably going to
vote Democratic, if at all.

<P>
   The old economy lives.
</P>
<P>
   Just when the dull old stocks that used to dominate the economy
appeared to be dead in the water, they took off with a vengeance
last week. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 666 points, or
6.7 percent, for the week.
</P>
<P>
   That's the largest weekly percentage gain for the Dow since the
summer of 1984, when the average began the big week at 1,114, or
only a little more than a tenth of the current level. In points, it
is by far the largest weekly leap ever.
</P>
<P>
   That move was welcome for investors who had avoided the
technology stocks that have dominated the stock market,
particularly during the last six months. Stocks in such industries
as banking, insurance, retail and electric utilities were trading
at their lowest level in a couple of years, even as the tech stocks
zoomed to ever higher levels.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, stocks that are traditionally sensitive to the
economy, like Caterpillar and Goodyear, were trading as if a
recession were imminent, even though virtually all the economic
numbers show that the boom continues unabated despite four rounds
of interest-rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   The fifth such move is virtually certain to arrive on Tuesday,
but fear of the Fed seems to have faded.
</P>
<P>
   One reason it faded is that the latest inflation numbers took on
a rosy glow after Wall Street was through interpreting them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Outside of oil prices, there is nothing going on on the
inflation front,'' said Bruce Steinberg, the chief economist of
Merrill Lynch, who figures that oil prices will start coming down
this spring as oil producers step up output.
</P>
<P>
   ``Market participants are wagering that Alan Greenspan, faced
with continued good news on the inflation front, will recant,''
said Robert Barbera, the chief economist of Hoenig &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   But Barbera thinks that is wrong. He thinks that Greenspan, who
has repeatedly said that Americans are spending too much, in part
because rising stock prices have made them feel wealthier, is
worried about the ways in which the stock market has changed over
the last year.
</P>
<P>
   Higher rates caused investors in the old economy to worry, but
technology stocks have roared back after every plunge. That
happened again last week, as the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite fell
more than 11 percent in the first three and a half days of trading,
then made up most of the losses in the final day and a half.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, consumer spending is running higher than most
economists expected and stock market investors are borrowing money
at a record rate to finance their investments.
</P>
<P>
   It appears that mutual fund buyers have continued to pour money
into the narrow group of funds that buy fast-growing technology
companies.
</P>
<P>
   If Barbera is right, then the Fed is likely to keep raising
rates until the new-economy stocks finally go down and stay down.
</P>
<P>
   If so, it remains to be seen whether the old-economy stocks _
not to mention the old economy itself _ can withstand the
onslaught.  &QL;

particularly during the last six months. Stocks in such industries
as banking, insurance, retail and electric utilities were trading
at their lowest level in a couple of years, even as the tech stocks
zoomed to ever higher levels.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, stocks that are traditionally sensitive to the
economy, like Caterpillar and Goodyear, were trading as if a
recession were imminent, even though virtually all the economic
numbers show that the boom continues unabated despite four rounds
of interest-rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   The fifth such move is virtually certain to arrive on Tuesday,
but fear of the Fed seems to have faded.
</P>
<P>
   One reason it faded is that the latest inflation numbers took on
a rosy glow after Wall Street was through interpreting them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Outside of oil prices, there is nothing going on on the
inflation front,'' said Bruce Steinberg, the chief economist of
Merrill Lynch, who figures that oil prices will start coming down
this spring as oil producers step up output.
</P>
<P>
   ``Market participants are wagering that Alan Greenspan, faced
with continued good news on the inflation front, will recant,''
said Robert Barbera, the chief economist of Hoenig &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   But Barbera thinks that is wrong. He thinks that Greenspan, who
has repeatedly said that Americans are spending too much, in part
because rising stock prices have made them feel wealthier, is
worried about the ways in which the stock market has changed over
the last year.
</P>
<P>
   Higher rates caused investors in the old economy to worry, but
technology stocks have roared back after every plunge. That
happened again last week, as the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite fell
more than 11 percent in the first three and a half days of trading,
then made up most of the losses in the final day and a half.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, consumer spending is running higher than most
economists expected and stock market investors are borrowing money
at a record rate to finance their investments.
</P>
<P>
   It appears that mutual fund buyers have continued to pour money
into the narrow group of funds that buy fast-growing technology
companies.
</P>
<P>
   If Barbera is right, then the Fed is likely to keep raising
rates until the new-economy stocks finally go down and stay down.
</P>
<P>
   If so, it remains to be seen whether the old-economy stocks _
not to mention the old economy itself _ can withstand the
onslaught.  &QL;

   The old economy lives.
</P>
<P>
   Just when the dull old stocks that used to dominate the economy
appeared to be dead in the water, they took off with a vengeance
last week. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 666 points, or
6.7 percent, for the week.
</P>
<P>
   That's the largest weekly percentage gain for the Dow since the
summer of 1984, when the average began the big week at 1,114, or
only a little more than a tenth of the current level. In points, it
is by far the largest weekly leap ever.

PESTS ATTACKING L.A.
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL COIT  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ First came the redgum lerp psyllids, tiny
aphid-like pests sucking life from stands of eucalyptus trees
across the San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   A few months later, Africanized honeybees ``killer bees''
</P>
<P>
   invaded the Valley, their swarms posing serious health risks.
</P>
<P>
   Now come the red imported fire ants, turning up in Van Nuys last
week to mark the crop-eating, flesh-stinging pest's continued march
north.
</P>
<P>
   Plagues of the Valley, the troublesome threesome are thriving to
varying degrees thanks to the region's warm climate, irrigated
landscaping and mild winters. The killer bees and potentially the
red fire ants are particularly bothersome and could forever alter
the lifestyles of Valley residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is paradise for these pests,'' said Larry Cooper,
spokesman for the California Department of Food and Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   A half-dozen or so new pests are identified in California each
year.
</P>
<P>
   Valley residents have weathered periodic quarantines and
sprayings for the Mediterranean fruit fly and other fruit flies.
Still, backyard fruit remains bountiful.
</P>
<P>
   State and county agricultural officials are trying to combat or
at least control the psyllids, killer bees and red fire ants. But
they concede that the killer bees are here to stay and the red fire
ants will be tough to root out with pesticides developed in
Southern states with different climates.
</P>
<P>
   So residents need to be wary to keep the pests from swarming and
stinging.
</P>
<P>
   The psyllids might be controlled by tiny wasps to be released
this spring. But they won't be eradicated and will remain a
nuisance, spreading a sticky honeydew excretion on leaves that
damages cars and sticks to just about everything, including pet
paws and human hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does seem like we're being picked on,'' said Cato Fiksdal,
Los Angeles County's agricultural commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're pests that are really going to affect people in an
urban environment. It's different from fighting a Medfly. There's
certainly a much stronger direct connection to people.''
</P>
<P>
   Residents on Cantaloupe Avenue, where the red fire ant find was
reported, already are preparing for life with the pest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm originally from Florida. They've got red fire ants
everywhere,'' said Carolyn Lombardo, who lives on Cantaloupe.
``It's like the smog here, you just live with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Heather Campbell appreciated the presence of county agriculture
inspectors on the street last week, passing out pamphlets and
answering questions on how to deal with red fire ants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to know that we should be on the lookout,'' Campbell
said. ``They think it's a hitchhiker, so I'm not worried about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Like fruit flies, the psyllids and red fire ants likely arrived
on some plant or cargo material transported illegally around
federal and state inspection efforts, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The killer bees were expected to colonize Los Angeles County
sooner, having moved into the state after getting established in
areas of Texas, New Mexico and Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of these pests does not signal some change in the
Valley ecosystem. They're just finding the same pleasing climate
that draws people from across the nation and world.
</P>
<P>
   Psyllids are native to Australia, where the semiarid
Mediterranean climate is comparable to California.
</P>
<P>
   Killer bees have been colonizing and pollinating the southern
reaches of the Western Hemisphere since they were first introduced
into Brazil in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   Red fire ants like warm and wet conditions. While Southern
California is considerably drier than the Southeastern states where
the red fire ant is entrenched, vast expanses of irrigated
landscaping provide ample water sources.
</P>
<P>
   Once detected, the pests could be here in numbers too great to
eradicate, said Aurelio Posadas, the state agriculture department's
red fire ant program supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have detection traps. We don't have any lures to set
up a trapping system to allow you to find it in a size small enough
so you can jump in and eradicate rapidly.''
</P>
<P>
   Depending on how widespread the infestation is, ``You have to
decide whether it's going to eradication, management or biological
controls.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL 2ND TAKE FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The psyllid infestation has been the worst on street trees since
a whitefly descended on ash trees across Los Angeles in 1989. The
psyllid showed up in Los Angeles County and in the Bay Area about
the same time in 1998, spreading to the San Gabriel Valley and
Orange County and from Sacramento to Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Although widespread, the psyllid might be controlled by a tiny
wasp found to prey on the psyllid in Australia. A University of
California at Berkeley entomologist has led an effort to breed the
wasp that county officials said should be released this spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on the verge of knocking them back. We think it will put
them into a control situation,'' said Fiksdal, the county
agricultural commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   The same cannot be said for killer bees. No state or country has
been able to keep down the pest since it was first introduced into
Brazil in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   The killer bees began colonizing in the United States in 1990
and have been entrenched in Los Angeles County since last April.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're learning to live with it,'' said Cooper, the state
agriculture spokesman. ``We can eradicate populations quickly, but
that's not going to eradicate infestation.''
</P>
<P>
   State and county officials are more optimistic about eradicating
red fire ants.
</P>
<P>
   The pest entered the Southern United States in the 1920s and has
spread to 11 states. It appeared in California in San Joaquin
Valley orchards in 1997 and made its way to Orange County in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fire ants' biggest moves have been through the helpful
human. We still consider it an exotic pest that we have an
eradication program for,'' said Posadas, the state's red fire ant
chief.
</P>
<P>
   County agricultural inspectors are on the front line of the
battle, spraying pesticides that sterilize queens and kill red fire
ants foraging for food. Los Angeles County recently added six
inspectors to the effort.
</P>
<P>
   Quarantines also prohibit the movement of soil and nursery stock
out of Orange County and south Los Angeles County.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're more than a nuisance,'' said Les Greenberg, a
University of California, Riverside, entomologist leading a new
research project on the pest. ``The fire ant is a broad-based pest,
a pest to people, animals, agriculture, the nursery industry.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The FBI marked the golden anniversary of its 10
Most Wanted list last week with a sense of pride, and just a touch
of nostalgia.
</P>
<P>
   The pride is easy to understand: of 458 men and women who have
made the list in the last half-century, 429 have been caught, with
several choosing to go down shooting it out with their would-be
captors. Cases against 15 individuals who were never caught were
eventually dropped, and four more fugitives were removed from the
list because others were deemed more deserving.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI noted that 134 of the 429 who have been tracked down
were captured as a direct result of cooperation by alert citizens.
Small wonder that FBI Director Louis J. Freeh extolled the ``10
Most Wanted Fugitives'' list, to use its formal name, not just as a
continuing demonstration of his agents' skill and dedication but as
a fruitful partnership of law enforcement people, the public and
the news media.
</P>
<P>
   But why the nostalgia? ``It's part of Americana,'' said Rex
Tomb, chief of the FBI's fugitive-publicity unit. In the good old
days, he said, there were bank robbers, burglars and car thieves,
along with run-of-the-mill killers. ``Now, some of that stuff looks
almost quaint,'' Tomb said.
</P>
<P>
   The latest 10 include Osama bin Laden, the wealthy Saudi Arabian
suspected of masterminding the deadly 1998 bombings of two U.S.
embassies in Africa; Eric Rudolph, who is suspected of six
bombings, including fatal ones at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta and
at an abortion clinic in Birmingham, Ala.; and Agustin
Vasquez-Mendoza, charged in the 1994 murder of an undercover
anti-drug agent.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the senior member of the list, Donald Eugene Webb,
whose speciality was jewelry-store burglaries. He is 68, if he is
still alive. His face, luckily for him a forgettable one, has been
adorning post office walls since he made the most-wanted list on
May 4, 1981, several months after he capped his career by killing a
police chief in a small Pennsylvania town.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Eugene Webb (also known as A.D. Baker, John S. Portas and
various other aliases) is a good starting point for any discussion
about criminals on the run. But first, some history.
</P>
<P>
   In 1949, a wire-service reporter asked the FBI for a list of the
``toughest guys'' it wanted to capture. The agency happily
complied, supplying a list of the 10 fugitives it considered the
most dangerous. Director J. Edgar Hoover was so delighted with the
interest stirred by the list that he made it permanent.
</P>
<P>
   On March 14, 1950, the 10 Most Wanted Fugitives program was
born. The first name put on the list was one Thomas Holden, a
Depression-era train robber who had already served 15 years in
prison and tried the straight life.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't like it. In 1949, he shot his wife and her two
brothers to death in Chicago after a drinking party and vanished.
On June 23, 1951, he was captured in Oregon after a newspaper
reader recognized him from a picture accompanying an article about
the most-wanted fugitives. The criminal lived out his days behind
bars.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI chooses candidates for the list based on their criminal
records and whether bureau officials think publicity might help in
catching them. Information leading directly to an arrest carries a
$50,000 reward.
</P>
<P>
   Fugitives have been caught in every state except Alaska, Maine
and Delaware, at an average of 1,000 miles from the crime scene.
Twenty-six have been caught in other countries. Seven women have
made the list. Several criminals have made the list twice, most
notoriously James Earl Ray, who made the list as the suspected
assassin of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and again after he
escaped from prison.
</P>
<P>
   Billie Austin Bryant of Washington had the shortest stay on the
list. He was put on immediately after killing two FBI agents on
Jan. 8, 1969. He was taken off when he was found in an attic _ two
hours later.
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, radio and newspapers were the big publicity
engines. Then came television. On May 19, 1996, an American
teen-ager living in Guatemala and surfing on his father's computer
visited the FBI site on that newfangled communications tool called
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-ager called up the most-wanted list and was amazed to
see the face of a local handyman who called himself Bill Young.
Could Bill Young really be Leslie Isben Rogge, a bank robber who
had escaped from an Iowa prison? He was, and very soon he was back
behind bars, the first most-wanted fugitive captured because of the
Web.
</P>
<P>
   Pictures and capsule biographies of the most-wanted are posted
at www.fbi.gov/mostwanted.htm. The site even includes some home
movies, preserving the subjects' strides and accents and tugs at
the ears and other mannerisms that can never be disguised entirely.
</P>
<P>
   There are no home movies of Donald Eugene Webb, who has toiled
as a butcher, managed a restaurant, repaired vending machines and
sold cars and real estate. He leaves big tips and he loves dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Enough about his good points, Tomb said. Webb killed a police
chief, shot him point-blank after beating him. The heartbreak of
the victim's survivors must never be forgotten, Tomb said.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the FBI still displays the forgettable face of Donald
Eugene Webb.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The FBI marked the golden anniversary of its 10
Most Wanted list last week with a sense of pride, and just a touch
of nostalgia.
</P>
<P>
   The pride is easy to understand: of 458 men and women who have
made the list in the last half-century, 429 have been caught, with
several choosing to go down shooting it out with their would-be
captors. Cases against 15 individuals who were never caught were
eventually dropped, and four more fugitives were removed from the
list because others were deemed more deserving.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI noted that 134 of the 429 who have been tracked down
were captured as a direct result of cooperation by alert citizens.
Small wonder that FBI Director Louis J. Freeh extolled the ``10
Most Wanted Fugitives'' list, to use its formal name, not just as a
continuing demonstration of his agents' skill and dedication but as
a fruitful partnership of law enforcement people, the public and
the news media.
</P>
<P>
   But why the nostalgia? ``It's part of Americana,'' said Rex
Tomb, chief of the FBI's fugitive-publicity unit. In the good old
days, he said, there were bank robbers, burglars and car thieves,
along with run-of-the-mill killers. ``Now, some of that stuff looks
almost quaint,'' Tomb said.
</P>
<P>
   The latest 10 include Osama bin Laden, the wealthy Saudi Arabian
suspected of masterminding the deadly 1998 bombings of two U.S.
embassies in Africa; Eric Rudolph, who is suspected of six
bombings, including fatal ones at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta and
at an abortion clinic in Birmingham, Ala.; and Agustin
Vasquez-Mendoza, charged in the 1994 murder of an undercover
anti-drug agent.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the senior member of the list, Donald Eugene Webb,
whose speciality was jewelry-store burglaries. He is 68, if he is
still alive. His face, luckily for him a forgettable one, has been
adorning post office walls since he made the most-wanted list on
May 4, 1981, several months after he capped his career by killing a
police chief in a small Pennsylvania town.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Eugene Webb (also known as A.D. Baker, John S. Portas and
various other aliases) is a good starting point for any discussion
about criminals on the run. But first, some history.
</P>
<P>
   In 1949, a wire-service reporter asked the FBI for a list of the
``toughest guys'' it wanted to capture. The agency happily
complied, supplying a list of the 10 fugitives it considered the
most dangerous. Director J. Edgar Hoover was so delighted with the
interest stirred by the list that he made it permanent.
</P>
<P>
   On March 14, 1950, the 10 Most Wanted Fugitives program was
born. The first name put on the list was one Thomas Holden, a
Depression-era train robber who had already served 15 years in
prison and tried the straight life.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't like it. In 1949, he shot his wife and her two
brothers to death in Chicago after a drinking party and vanished.
On June 23, 1951, he was captured in Oregon after a newspaper
reader recognized him from a picture accompanying an article about
the most-wanted fugitives. The criminal lived out his days behind
bars.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI chooses candidates for the list based on their criminal
records and whether bureau officials think publicity might help in
catching them. Information leading directly to an arrest carries a
$50,000 reward.
</P>
<P>
   Fugitives have been caught in every state except Alaska, Maine
and Delaware, at an average of 1,000 miles from the crime scene.
Twenty-six have been caught in other countries. Seven women have
made the list. Several criminals have made the list twice, most
notoriously James Earl Ray, who made the list as the suspected
assassin of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and again after he
escaped from prison.
</P>
<P>
   Billie Austin Bryant of Washington had the shortest stay on the
list. He was put on immediately after killing two FBI agents on
Jan. 8, 1969. He was taken off when he was found in an attic _ two
hours later.
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, radio and newspapers were the big publicity
engines. Then came television. On May 19, 1996, an American
teen-ager living in Guatemala and surfing on his father's computer
visited the FBI site on that newfangled communications tool called
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-ager called up the most-wanted list and was amazed to
see the face of a local handyman who called himself Bill Young.
Could Bill Young really be Leslie Isben Rogge, a bank robber who
had escaped from an Iowa prison? He was, and very soon he was back
behind bars, the first most-wanted fugitive captured because of the
Web.
</P>
<P>
   Pictures and capsule biographies of the most-wanted are posted
at www.fbi.gov/mostwanted.htm. The site even includes some home
movies, preserving the subjects' strides and accents and tugs at
the ears and other mannerisms that can never be disguised entirely.
</P>
<P>
   There are no home movies of Donald Eugene Webb, who has toiled
as a butcher, managed a restaurant, repaired vending machines and
sold cars and real estate. He leaves big tips and he loves dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Enough about his good points, Tomb said. Webb killed a police
chief, shot him point-blank after beating him. The heartbreak of
the victim's survivors must never be forgotten, Tomb said.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the FBI still displays the forgettable face of Donald
Eugene Webb.

   LOS ANGELES _ People here recoiled at the news last week that
The Los Angeles Times had been sold to an out-of-town company, with
many moaning that this insecure city _ frequently described by its
residents as a shapeless megalopolis that doesn't even have, or
deserve, a professional football team _ had been robbed of an
essential piece of its identity.
</P>
<P>
   But the real symbolic weight of the event may not have been that
the Tribune Co., a media giant from Chicago, bought Los Angeles'
most influential newspaper, but that it was up for sale in the
first place.
</P>
<P>
   The institutional voice of this multi-throated city, controlled
for more than a century by a wealthy family that defined the
establishment, had been sold off to the highest bidder. The deal
drove home the reality that Los Angeles' once solid civic
architecture has been largely dismantled in recent years, under
pressure from dramatic economic and demographic changes. And no one
is quite sure what will replace it.
</P>
<P>
   Yet what was disconcerting for many is that it is not at all
clear what kind of power structure will replace the one that
appeared to be waning.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the sale of The Los Angeles Times there's a loss of the
last remnants of our old governing structure,'' said Antonio
Villaraigosa, the speaker of the California state Assembly and a
declared candidate for next year's mayoral race. ``Something will
take the place of the old structure, but it's hard to say what it
will look like.''
</P>
<P>
   Jose Legaspi, a real estate developer and a member of the board
of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, said he believed that
the talk here all week of a loss of identity with the sale of The
Los Angeles Times was really code for the resistance of many people
to the strong tide of ethnic change.
</P>
<P>
   ``The loss of identity was not because companies were sold but
because of the demographic changes here,'' Legaspi said. ``People
tended to react against it. The business and political leaders, the
old stakeholders, they didn't know how to deal with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Eli Broad, the chairman of Sun America and a longstanding civic
booster who has helped create two major museums and is a leader of
the committee planning this summer's Democratic presidential
convention, said he agreed that some people were overreacting
simply out of fear of the new. The city still has powerful
basketball (the Lakers) and baseball (the Dodgers) franchises, he
noted, and the economy, now driven by small, entrepreneurial
companies, is thriving. He said, though, that the changes were
deep, their ultimate impact uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish it hadn't happened,'' Broad said of the sale of the
newspaper. ``I wish it had stayed with local ownership, but I'm not
sure it matters. The old power structure is changing and we're
headed toward something new.''
</P>
<P>
   The signs of civic change have been conspicuous. Forty years
ago, when the city's elite decided that they needed a major new
performing arts center, Buffy Chandler, the wife of The Los Angeles
Times' publisher, Norman Chandler, organized her friends and built
a world-class complex. Just a few years ago, efforts to construct a
new cultural complex downtown, Disney Hall, foundered
embarrassingly for lack of money until a last ditch private
fund-raising effort got construction moving.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles lost out to Houston last year in a bid to get a new
professional football franchise, in large measure because city
leaders would not offer as generous a financial package. The San
Fernando Valley, a generally affluent, mostly white swath of the
city, has been trying to secede.
</P>
<P>
   Giant corporate citizens like Lockheed, Rockwell International,
Unocal and First Interstate Bank have either moved, been sold or
broken up, and now Arco, a staunch city booster for years, is set
to be sold.
</P>
<P>
   But even while there are signs that the cohesiveness of the old
elite has frayed, there are also signs that a new civic order is
taking shape and that it is responding to the realities of a city
which is roughly 60 percent Hispanic and Asian American and less
than 28 percent non-Hispanic white .
</P>
<P>
   For instance, this past week the Autry Museum of Western
Heritage said it would open a major exhibit this summer documenting
the role of Chinese Americans in the west, the largest such show of
its kind.
</P>
<P>
   In a departure from its traditional focus on middle-class car
culture, the Petersen Auto Museum has a first-of-its-kind exhibit
on lowriders, the flamboyant street cruisers favored by Chicanos
here. When the Getty Museum was initially flooded with visitors, it
eliminated all radio advertising, except on Spanish-language
stations.
</P>
<P>
   The United Way of Los Angeles, an organization whose board was
often seen as a badge of prestige for the city's elite, announced
earlier this year that it was adopting a new philosophy under which
it would cut contributions to many of the organizations it had
traditionally supported, like the American Heart Association and
the American Lung Association.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it will start contributing a portion of the $62 million
it raises each year to programs that focus on poor people in the
inner city _ meaning largely new immigrants. And the group says it
will be offering not hand-outs but programs to help the recipients
get better jobs, buy their own homes and prepare their children for
English-language schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very much colorblind in making this new policy,'' said
Dominic Ng, the chairman of EastWest Bank and head of the United
Way committee that formulated the policy. ``But what we did will
move us away from what you might call mainstream white America. Los
Angeles is changing, so we had to change. You can't look back and
be sentimental. You move forward and respond to the realities.''

<P>
   Vince Lombardi kept saying no. For three years, Ed Sabol, the
president of NFL Films, had tried every argument to entice the
Green Bay Packers' coach to wear a microphone on the sidelines.
Still no. So with the clock running out, Sabol went deep:
``Vince,'' he said, ``let us put a mike on you, and we'll make you
the John Wayne of pro football.''
</P>
<P>
   That did it. And a few years later, Sabol's 1967 prime-time
special, ``Lombardi,'' captured the autocrat with a new dimension
of authenticity. Showing him rail at referees and bark at his
players _ ``Everybody grabbin' out there! Nobody tacklin'! Grab!
Grab! Grab! Grab! Grab!'' _ the film cast his legend forever.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-three years later, the never-ending rush for ``inside
access'' to sports personalities hit a speed bump last week:
Several National Basketball Association coaches risked $100,000
fines by refusing a league edict to wear microphones during games.
Their reasoning was simple _ that as much as fans would love to
hear snippets of how they sketched out that last pick-and-roll or
lit a fire under a sullen superstar, some parts of their jobs can't
be done properly with the specter of millions of eavesdroppers.
</P>
<P>
   What they were saying, in effect, was that this is not the
Lombardi era any more; rather than embrace what the media can do
for them, they fear what it can do  &UR; to &LR;  them. It's the difference
between John Wayne and John Rocker.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA wanted to wire coaches to make their product more
appealing to the interactive generation, which craves more intimate
glimpses behind what were once closed doors. (Cameras inside locker
rooms have also been proposed.) Network television ratings are down
14 percent this season, and the league is scrambling to deliver
something more delectable.
</P>
<P>
   Which is exactly what the coaches fear they will provide. Giving
away strategy is one thing, but ``No more laziness, Alonzo!''
morphs from an exhortation into a public flogging. Although remarks
are not heard live but are spliced together by a production crew
for use minutes later, what the networks and coaches consider
worthwhile will surely lie on opposite ends of the salacious scale.
</P>
<P>
   A feeling of helplessness before the increasingly invasive news
media has already pushed sports figures further and further into
the bunker of cliche-speak, robbing the public of the authenticity
it craves. (Interviews with the Los Angeles Lakers' Shaquille
O'Neal, for example, have the effervescence of oatmeal.) With any

   Vince Lombardi kept saying no. For three years, Ed Sabol, the
president of NFL Films, had tried every argument to entice the
Green Bay Packers' coach to wear a microphone on the sidelines.
Still no. So with the clock running out, Sabol went deep:
``Vince,'' he said, ``let us put a mike on you, and we'll make you
the John Wayne of pro football.''
</P>
<P>
   That did it. And a few years later, Sabol's 1967 prime-time
special, ``Lombardi,'' captured the autocrat with a new dimension
of authenticity. Showing him rail at referees and bark at his
players _ ``Everybody grabbin' out there! Nobody tacklin'! Grab!
Grab! Grab! Grab! Grab!'' _ the film cast his legend forever.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-three years later, the never-ending rush for ``inside
access'' to sports personalities hit a speed bump last week:
Several National Basketball Association coaches risked $100,000
fines by refusing a league edict to wear microphones during games.
Their reasoning was simple _ that as much as fans would love to
hear snippets of how they sketched out that last pick-and-roll or
lit a fire under a sullen superstar, some parts of their jobs can't
be done properly with the specter of millions of eavesdroppers.
</P>
<P>
   What they were saying, in effect, was that this is not the
Lombardi era any more; rather than embrace what the media can do
for them, they fear what it can do  &UR; to &LR;  them. It's the difference
between John Wayne and John Rocker.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA wanted to wire coaches to make their product more
appealing to the interactive generation, which craves more intimate
glimpses behind what were once closed doors. (Cameras inside locker
rooms have also been proposed.) Network television ratings are down
14 percent this season, and the league is scrambling to deliver
something more delectable.
</P>
<P>
   Which is exactly what the coaches fear they will provide. Giving
away strategy is one thing, but ``No more laziness, Alonzo!''
morphs from an exhortation into a public flogging. Although remarks
are not heard live but are spliced together by a production crew
for use minutes later, what the networks and coaches consider
worthwhile will surely lie on opposite ends of the salacious scale.
</P>
<P>
   A feeling of helplessness before the increasingly invasive news
media has already pushed sports figures further and further into
the bunker of cliche-speak, robbing the public of the authenticity
it craves. (Interviews with the Los Angeles Lakers' Shaquille
O'Neal, for example, have the effervescence of oatmeal.) With any
untoward utterance instantly picked apart throughout an impregnable
web of talk shows, newspaper polls and Internet sites, judgment
travels as fast and undaunted as electricity itself.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ This year's Senate elections seem likely to produce
modest Democratic gains, but too small to take control from the
Republicans, leaders of both parties agree.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides will be watching the outcome closely, because it
probably will set the stage for an even more intense fight for
control in 2002. Democrats see great opportunities then, when 20
seats held by Republicans will be on the ballot, compared with only
13 held by Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   In this year's races, 10 of the 19 Republican seats being
contested are at various degrees of risk, compared with only five
of the 14 Democratic seats. That's enough of an edge in the odds to
give the Democrats grounds for optimism. The Republicans now enjoy
a 55-45 majority.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert G. Torricelli, D-N.J., who heads his party's
campaign committee, said ``a majority is certainly within range''
in 2000. But, he added, ``Everything has to break right.''
</P>
<P>
   His Republican counterpart, Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky,
called a reduced majority ``a reasonable surmise.'' Gone are the
days when Republicans raised the hopes of a filibuster-proof
majority of 60 seats, which seemed possible in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Still, neither party, let alone the individual candidates,
thinks of this year as only the first part of a two-tiered
election. It is still 33 quite separate races. ``Right now you
certainly don't see any kind of national tide,'' Linda DiVall, a
Republican pollster, said.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans base their hopes for holding their own on four
Democratic retirements. They are concentrating on the opportunity
that probably offers them the greatest potential satisfaction:
defeating Hillary Rodham Clinton in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one that will rival the presidential in magnitude,''
McConnell said, though he added that he thought Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani of New York would not need as much help from the party as
some other candidates.
</P>
<P>
   But neither will Clinton, who can raise money on her own.
Democrats count themselves fortunate that they probably will have
self-financing candidates in the most expensive states with Senate
elections this year: Clinton in New York, Dianne Feinstein in
California and, if he wins the primary, Jon Corzine in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats have four seats at risk because of retirements _
Bob Kerrey's in Nebraska, Richard Bryan's in Nevada, Frank
Lautenberg's in New Jersey and Daniel Patrick Moynihan's in New
York. The Nevada seat seems like a probable Republican gain, with
former Rep. John Ensign much better known than his Democratic
opponent, Ed Bernstein, a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   In Nebraska, a strongly Republican state, the Democrats have
their best possible candidate, former Gov. Ben Nelson. A Republican
primary on May 9 will determine his rival.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, both parties here think the Democrats will have
an edge if Corzine, a wealthy financier but a political unknown,
defeats former Gov. Jim Florio in the June 6 primary. Republicans
say they think either of their likely nominees, Rep. Bob Franks or
state Sen. Bill Gormley, could defeat Florio, who lost his bid for
re-election in 1993 because of voter anger over tax increases.
</P>
<P>
   The only Democratic incumbent in any obvious peril is Sen.
Charles S. Robb of Virginia, who is seeking a third term against
former Gov. George F. Allen. In presidential years Virginia has
long been a heavily Republican state, and most polls show Allen
ahead, although Robb has made comebacks before.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have only one open seat to defend, that of Connie
Mack of Florida. Rep. Bill McCollum has a fat war chest but may
have to spend much of it to win the Republican nomination against
Tom Gallagher, the state education commissioner. With a Sept. 5
primary, the calendar may favor Bill Nelson, the Democratic
insurance commissioner, who is facing less opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican incumbents in the greatest jeopardy include five
freshmen: Spencer Abraham of Michigan, John Ashcroft of Missouri,
Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island, Rod Grams of Minnesota and Rick
Santorum of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham and Grams have failed to establish themselves clearly.
In Michigan, Rep. Debbie Stabenow is a formidable challenger. In
Minnesota, Grams has had two campaign shake-ups, but Democrats will
not settle on an opponent until their Sept. 12 primary.
</P>
<P>
   Chafee, appointed last November to succeed his father, John
Chafee, has a similar advantage in Rhode Island. Rep. Bob Weygand
and former Lt. Gov. Richard Licht will contest the Democratic
nomination on Sept. 12, and the winner will hope that the state's
heavy Democratic majority can overcome whatever bitterness and
fund-raising problems remain for an eight-week general election
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft, a former governor, has no shortage of name recognition
in Missouri and a solid campaign organization. But he faces one of
the most formidable Democratic challengers this year, Gov. Mel
Carnahan, and his steadfast support of the 1996 Freedom to Farm
Act, which phased out crop subsidies, is hurting him with one of
the few issues that extend beyond a single state this year: the
problems of grain farmers. Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster, said
the law ``certainly is creating big question marks for the Farm
Belt Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   Santorum, who has calmed down from his early confrontational
posture in the Senate, is in stronger shape than the others, but
the Pennsylvania race is hard to measure before the April 25
Democratic primary. Rep. Ron Klink, state Sen. Allyson Schwartz and
Tom P. Foley, a former state secretary of labor, are seeking the
Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Among Republican veterans, the most endangered is Sen. William
V. Roth Jr. of Delaware. He is chairman of the Finance Committee,
and in a more expensive state might overwhelm any opponent. But at
78, he is seeking his sixth term, and he faces a vigorous challenge
from Gov. Thomas R. Carper, who is 53.
</P>
<P>
   Two veteran Republicans both parties consider favored but
threatened are Conrad Burns in Montana and Slade Gorton in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Burns is expected to be opposed by Brian Schweitzer, a wealthy
peppermint farmer who has spent the last year going across Montana
attacking him. Schweitzer accuses Burns of breaking a promise to
quit after two terms and has been attacking him on the issues of
farm and asbestos legislation and drug prices. Burns once denied
that he had ever pledged not to seek a third term; he now says
Montana needs his seniority.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton, who is seeking his fourth term, will face the winner of
a September primary between two strong women candidates in a state
that has a higher percentage of women in public office than any
other.
</P>
<P>
   Former Rep. Maria Cantwell, who served one term before the
Gingrich revolution of 1994, is running against the state insurance
commissioner, Deborah Senn. While Gorton may seem increasingly
conservative for a state Democrats now count on in presidential
years, the Sept. 19 primary will leave the surviving Democrat only
seven weeks until the general election.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Democrats think they have a chance for a real upset in
Indiana, where David Johnson, a lawyer, is seeking to oust the
four-term incumbent, Richard G. Lugar. Democrats have been doing
better in Indiana in recent years, and are trying to use Lugar's
chairmanship of the Agriculture Committee to hang the Freedom to
Farm Act around his neck.

   In the space of three short decades, the computer chip industry
has come to resemble the Sorcerer's Apprentice.
</P>
<P>
   The exponential growth in computing power has produced stunning
advances in a range of sciences and engineering fields ranging from
decoding the human genome to the design of machines that can
outplay the best human chess player.
</P>
<P>
   And that in turn has led to exuberant predictions of a dawning
of vast new Information Age utopias. Sentient intelligent machines
are as close as three decades away, many industry leaders believe;
smart materials that can repair themselves and genetically coded
immortality may also be just around the corner.
</P>
<P>
   Given the hype and relentless optimism, perhaps it's not
surprising that serious scientists and researchers have begun to
explore darker, less inviting visions of the future.
</P>
<P>
   This month an unlikely new doomsday prophet has emerged. In an
essay in Wired magazine, a popular forum for high-technology
boosterism, Bill Joy, the chief scientist at Sun Microsystems,
warns that the human species may be on the verge of collective
suicide. ``The 21st-century technologies _ genetics, nanotechnology
and robotics _ are so powerful that they can spawn whole new
classes of accidents and abuses,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   Joy is hardly a Luddite, but his gloomy pronouncements fit
squarely into a long tradition of apocalyptic warnings about
technology run amok, dating back to ancient Greeks, and voiced more
recently in a millennial laundry list of threats, including nuclear
winters, global warming, ozone depletion, marauding comets, the
dispersion of deadly biological toxins by the Japanese Aum
Shinrikyo cult in Tokyo subways, as well as the specter of Y2K
calamities sending civilization back to smoky caves.
</P>
<P>
   As harrowing as all those threats may have appeared, for Joy and
others the worst is yet to come. The new danger, they argue, is
self-replication, the technique at the heart of both modern
biotechnology and the relatively new field of ``material sciences''
(the creation of advanced materials such as new ceramics or liquid
crystal displays), which has the capacity for both tremendous good
as well as destruction. The fears fall in three broad areas.
</P>
<P>
   Robotics &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The science fiction writer Isaac Asimov once described a world
in which advanced machines, even if their intelligence vastly
exceeded that of humans, could be programmed so they would never
intentionally take any action that would harm people.
</P>
<P>
   Now a number of writers and scientists are suggesting a more
ominous, Darwinian scenario in which super-intelligent machines
might evolve along with, and ultimately compete with, human
society.
</P>
<P>
   Consider a future world in which robots operate with
microprocessors a million times more powerful than today's. Hans
Moravec, a robotics scientist at Carnegie Mellon University,
conjures images in his writings of totally automated factories and
networks that will emerge as soon as 2020. These robotic systems
will be able to program themselves and compete vigorously with
humans for resources, perhaps creating self-sufficient artificially
intelligent economies that could squeeze humans out of existence.
(Think about a factory that decides to create an army of Robocops.)
</P>
<P>
   Another computer scientist, Vernor Vinge, says machine
intelligence will awaken sometime between 2005 and 2030, a date he
calls ``the singularity.'' Vinge argues that this evolutionary
watershed might accelerate progress well beyond human control.
</P>
<P>
   Others suggest that the Internet may someday reach a critical
mass of interconnections that at the least might exhibit some kind
of chaotic behavior, perhaps even some kind of sentience. The
problem, of course, is that such a system might be intelligent but
not rational, thrashing around like a newborn baby _ turning off
power systems or launching missiles at random.
</P>
<P>
   Nanotechnology &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nanotechnology refers to mechanical engineering on a molecular
scale. The holy grail for nanotechnologists are sub-microscopic
chemical or mechanical machines called assemblers that can
reproduce and repair themselves.
</P>
<P>
   There are already many industrial examples of micro-assemblers.
For example, Polymerase Chain Reaction, the exponential
amplification of DNA fragments, has become a standard tool of
biotechnologists.
</P>
<P>
   And last week IBM researchers described a process that permits
chemical assemblers to self-assemble tiny magnetic particles into a
perfectly aligned array of dots, each composed of several thousand
atoms, for future disk drives.

accidentally, nanotechnology could open a Pandora's Box. This
nightmare has long been the stuff of science fiction. Readers of
Kurt Vonnegut's 1963 novel ``Cat's Cradle'' may remember
``ice-nine,'' the final creation of the story's scientist, Felix
Hoenikker. Ice-nine was was solid at room temperature. In other
words, the molecules of H2 O in ice-nine had ``discovered'' a way
to stack up to form a crystalline solid at temperatures where other
molecules of H2 O were still in a liquid phase. This contagious
modification ultimately freezes the world's oceans. For several
decades now, however, nonfictional scientists have been toying with
the different ways that H2 O molecules can stack together.
</P>
<P>
   And in real life, it might be possible to create tough
omnivorous bacteria that could out-compete real bacteria. Spread by
the wind, like blowing pollen, they could be designed to replicate
swiftly and reduce life on earth to dust in a matter of days,
according to Eric Drexler, one of the nation's principal advocates
for nanotechnology. (Drexler advocates the construction of a series
of high technology ``shields'' to ward off these kinds of threats.)
</P>
<P>
   Genetic Engineering &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While both robots and nanotechnological weapons are at least a
generation away, genetic weapons are not. Joy and other scientists
have begun to warn of near-term terrorist threats based on
genetically engineered biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much of the talk about information-based weapons is baloney,''
said Edward Feigenbaum, the former chief scientist of the U.S. Air
Force. ``But biological terrorism is real and the government is
beginning to take steps to defend against it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists are worried both about the specter of genetic
experiments accidentally escaping into the population and also what
Joy calls a ``white plague'' (a reference to another science
fiction novel, by Frank Herbert) _ genetically engineered
bioweapons that could be targeted on a specific region or race.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't end there _ there are even more exotic technological
threats. Last year a brief media frenzy broke out over speculation
that the Brookhaven National Laboratory's Relativistic Heavy Ion
Collider could create an artificial black hole that would devour
the earth in a matter of minutes. Scientists insisted that such
fears were unfounded, yet as Armageddon scenarios go, it was a
doozy. Earlier this month several physicists filed suit in federal
court to stop the experiment.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it could be that Joy is wrong. After all, it is
possible to take comfort in the thought that despite several
thousand years of predictions of impending doom, the human species
is, by and large, thriving. Still, it is a bit unsettling.

HOLLYWOOD PERCEIVES SHIFT IN MOVIEGOERS' TASTES 
</HEADLINE>
  mk) 
 By RICK LYMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Not so long ago, the way to promote a major
mainstream movie was to put up a trailer that in the case of a
comedy included all the best jokes and in the case of a drama
included almost all the crucial plot points.
</P>
<P>
   Audiences craved the familiar. Knowing pretty much exactly what
they were going to get was somehow comforting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was almost like they were being ordered to go see the
film,'' said Brian Grazer, co-founder of Imagine Entertainment.
``Knowing what was going to happen somehow made them more likely to
go see it.''
</P>
<P>
   But as Hollywood prepares for the 72nd annual Academy Awards on
March 26 at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles, there is a
growing sense among many filmmakers and movie professionals that
something exciting and unexpected has happened to American
moviemaking over the last half-decade and with increasing force in
the last year: a fundamental shift in the taste of the mainstream
movie audience.
</P>
<P>
   After two decades of formula comedy, feel-good tales and big
budget he-man adventures, the mass audience seems much more willing
to embrace movies that astonish them, even in unsettling or
downbeat ways, and use fresh storytelling techniques to upend their
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence for this, they say, is not merely in the roster of
films vying for Oscars this year but also in the fact that many of
the most offbeat and thematically challenging of them were also
among the year's biggest box office hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The early '80s was when the quote-unquote high-concept notion
infected the studios, and infected is a good word for it,'' said
Terry Press, chief of marketing at DreamWorks. ``The idea was that
if you can't tell the story in two lines, don't make the movie
because audiences won't get it. That has literally taken 20 years
to die, but it's finally dead. It's been a long time coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid the predictable fare in the list of the biggest box office
hits of the last year are a significant number of genre-bending
movies that seemed to spring from nowhere, packing a surprise punch
or a subversive twist, like ``The Sixth Sense,'' ``American
Beauty,'' ``Three Kings,'' ``The Blair Witch Project'' and ``The
Matrix.'' Those are movies that could not stand up to that
traditional, tell-all kind of promotional campaign and would lose
their greatest appeal to audiences in doing so.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't have to have a dark edge, but the idea of surprise
is the crucial point,'' said Joe Roth, who left as president of
Walt Disney Studios late last year and is now forming his own
ministudio. ``The audience is way more sophisticated. They see it
all. I mean, any medium-market city has something like 100 cable
television channels and there's all the video and now DVD and the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at the point now where if you come at the audience in
the traditional way, they're way ahead of you. But if the public
hears about something fresh and new, they're onto it immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Lasse Halstrom, director of ``The Cider House Rules,'' had
detected a craving for substance after years of lighter fare. He
attributes this in part, he said, to the increasing number of media
outlets.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are finding so many interesting and sophisticated
things on cable television and the Internet that it is opening them
up to a different experience,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Howard said he caught the first glimmer of it during
audience previews for ``Ransom,'' the dark-tinged 1996 thriller he
directed with Mel Gibson playing an airline entrepreneur with an
unsavory secret. At all such previews, cards are given to the
audience on which they are asked to scribble comments about the
film; the answers guide both the director as he prepares his final
cut and marketing executives as they divine the film's box office
potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a good percentage on `Ransom' at every screening of
people who would say, `Oh, I thought the kidnapper was going to get
away and that would have been really cool,''' Howard said. ``I'm
not talking about 3 percent. I'm talking 15 or 20 percent. Every
time. Whether they really meant it, I don't know. But I do know
that having a lead character in that movie who was morally
compromised turned out to be an asset and that was something new,
something that five years ago I don't think would have been the
case.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Jinks and Bruce Cohen, who produced ``American Beauty,'' the
film that most here expect to win the most Oscars this year, say
they have no doubt that the critical and box office success of
their film was driven to a major extent by this new craving for
surprise and originality in movie audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Audiences are tired of seeing the same movies over and over
again,'' Cohen said. ``They also don't want to have movies jammed
down their throats. They want to discover them. There have always
been dark movies, but what's different now is that the storytelling
is a little bit different, not as formulaic.''
</P>
<P>
   No one argues that the change has been seismic or that these
kinds of films have come to dominate the mainstream, but just that
there has been a persistent shift in that direction. Genre films
and those relying on more traditional storytelling techniques are
still being made and often do quite handsomely at the box office.
It's just not a sure thing anymore, and that makes movie executives
nervous.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most interesting thing about this to me is that it's
almost as though audiences have reclaimed their power through word
of mouth,'' Press said. ```We won't be told what is good; we'll
tell you.' All of these movies are word-of-mouth hits. It used to
be there might be one word-of-mouth movie every year, but now
between `Sixth Sense' and `American Beauty' and the rest of them,
you can see the power of word of mouth reasserting itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Some say the trend portends a return to the more sophisticated
cinema tastes of the 1970s. Others that it is something entirely
new, spurred by the explosion in the numbers and forms of
competitive entertainment media and in the independent filmmaking
sensibility that took root at the Sundance Film Festival in the
1990s and has seeped into mainstream moviemaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it kind of begins with the Sundance, but it also has
to do with a more general cultural shift,'' Howard said. ``What I
have noticed is that the audience is much more interested in an
unexpected twist, even if it's a downbeat twist.''
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics, of course, say it is just wishful thinking to believe
that studios are about to abandon old formulas for a riskier, more
sophisticated form of storytelling. What is happening now, they
argue, may be more of a Prague Spring than an Endless Summer.

</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't yet noticed a major difference in the taste of the
studios,'' said Marc Norman, who wrote the Oscar-winning script for
``Shakespeare in Love'' with Tom Stoppard. ``I can remember a brief
moment during the making of `Shakespeare in Love' when one of the
marketing guys said if we could make it so the two main characters
could go off together at the end it would be worth $10 million at
the box office,'' Norman said. ``I don't know where he got that
figure, but he said it with great assurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really had to fight to beat that back, saying that it would
be cheap and against the thrust of the film up to that point,'' he
continued. ``But I don't think we've reached the point now where
some marketing executive would say, `Gee, it would be worth $10
million more at the box office if you kill the star.' No, that's
hard to imagine.''
</P>
<P>
   And others wonder whether Hollywood, grown fat on the reliable
formulas of the last two decades, will be able to rouse itself to
make the kinds of movies this new audience seems to desire.
</P>
<P>
   ``These films have shown they can be critical and box office
successes while using fresh and intricate forms of storytelling, so
as time goes on audiences become much more willing to take a chance
on things, to go out on a limb,'' said Paul Dergarabedian, chairman
of Exhibitor Relations, a Los Angeles-based company that tracks the
box office performance of films. ```Well,' they think, `if ``Sixth
Sense'' is this good and we didn't expect it to be like that then
maybe we should give this other movie a try, too.' But it's tricky.
Audiences are wanting to be more mentally stimulated and
challenged, but they still want to escape so it's a very thin
line.''
</P>
<P>
   Susannah Grant, a screenwriter with four movies to her credit (
``Pocahontas,'' ``Ever After,'' the new ``Erin Brockovich'' and the
soon-to-be-released ``28 Days''), said that she like other writers
was energized by the cultural excitement over the surprise ending
of ``The Sixth Sense'' and that she had also received feedback from
executives demanding more originality. ``The notes will say things
like, `We've seen this before,''' she said. ``But what isn't clear
to me is whether that's because of the people I happen to be
working with or because this is an industry in transition. It's
hard to tell.''
</P>
<P>
   What is particularly surprising _ and encouraging _ to
moviemakers is that there seems to be a greater crossover than in
previous years between the films earning critical kudos and Oscar
nominations and the films that are embraced enthusiastically by the
youngest, hippest audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing we kept hearing when we were preparing `American
Beauty' is that teen-agers just won't go see a movie unless it has
nothing but teen-agers in it,'' Jinks said.
</P>
<P>
   Not close to true, it turns out. Dozens of films were aimed at
teen-age audiences in 1999 but only a handful, most notably
``American Pie,'' connected with a mass audience. Meanwhile, movies
like ``Sixth Sense'' and ``American Beauty'' that in theory should
have had greater appeal to older audiences drew enormous audiences
of young people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think shock value equals cool in today's world,'' Howard
said. ``If you really distill it down, if something is a little bit
shocking or unexpected it has a better chance of attracting people.
I think there's just a broadening of tastes, a broader acceptance
of these tones.''
</P>
<P>
   It is always tricky to generalize about something as amorphous
as audience tastes, especially as an emerging trend toward offbeat
subjects and storytelling as presented in films like ``Sixth
Sense'' and ``American Beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that sometimes audiences accept movies like
that and sometimes they don't,'' said Bill Mechanic, chairman of
Fox Film Entertainment. He was talking, among other things, about
``The Fight Club,'' a 20th Century Fox film that had a decidedly
dark edge and employed fresh storytelling techniques but dropped
with a thud at the box office last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Norman said that movies were in a more adventurous phase at the
moment only because the older formulas had gone flat before studios
were able to pinpoint the next formula.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we are in a period where there isn't anything in the
studios' mind that is as sure-fire and risk-free as the Arnold or
Sly action movies used to be,'' Norman said. ``But it doesn't mean
that they're abandoning formulas. It's that the studios are kind of
in-between. If we're getting more adventurous movies at the moment
it's only because they are looking for the next formula, the next
sure thing.''

   WASHINGTON _ Super Tuesday has come and gone, but stand by for
another defining event. Call it OPEC Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the stage. The oil cartel, once dismissed as a
has-been, has displayed startling muscle in the past year, sending
oil prices tripling to more than $30 a barrel. That has sent
gasoline prices soaring, and suddenly the American economy no
longer seems quite so invincible.
</P>
<P>
   At the next meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, on March 27 in Vienna, the question on the table will be
whether it is time to reverse the price tide. The answer matters a
lot, and not just to experts worried about the pace of
international economic growth. In this election year, what happens
March 27 will touch directly on American wallets, by determining
just what kinds of prices American voters confront every time they
pull up to the pump all spring and summer _ and right up to
Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   Little wonder, then, that oil is quickly becoming an issue
between George W. Bush and Al Gore, who effectively clinched their
party's nominations in the Super Tuesday primaries of March 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the kind of issue voters take home with them,'' said
Andrew Kohut, a public opinion expert and director of the Pew
Research Center in Washington. ``On some issues, like campaign
finance, that don't really affect voters directly, the voters will
often say that neither candidate is any better than the other. But
on issues that affect the old pocketbook, there is a greater
propensity for voters to choose sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Until now, a bedrock assumption about the political campaign has
been that anyone trying to unseat the Democrats from the White
House would have a tough job persuading Americans to be
dissatisfied. Even as Wall Street rockets along, the economy has
managed to keep inflation down and unemployment almost nonexistent
at the same time _ for most of a decade. That is not the kind of
situation to make a voter uneasy about his or her wallet, or
resentful of a member of the White House team. Or so Al Gore's
managers have assumed.
</P>
<P>
   Enter uncertainty. A first blast of ire over soaring fuel prices
is already being registered by American truckers, who have
demonstrated twice in Washington in the past month. And government
statistics released last week showed that producer prices increased
by 1 percent in February, their largest such gain in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all of that surge was due to higher energy costs. Even
though Wall Street seemed to shrug off the bad news, the
inescapable nature of gasoline prices will make them all but
impossible for ordinary Americans to ignore, experts say. Bad news
at the pump is bound to compound any gnawing sense of uneasiness,
particularly if the Federal Reserve Board continues to weigh in
against inflation with incremental increases in interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gasoline prices are the most visible prices in the United
States,'' said Donald Ratajczak, director of economic forecasting
at the University of South Georgia. ``Every time you drive to and
from work, they're staring you in the face.''
</P>
<P>
   Translate that into political terms, and it is easy to
understand how high the stakes are for the Clinton administration,
and Gore in particular, at that meeting in Vienna. Even if a
decision is made then to boost oil production, prices will remain
high over the summer. But if they are receding by, say, October,
voters could approach Election Day reassured about the future. And
that is what Democrats are hoping for.
</P>
<P>
   It also helps explain the sense of alarm with which the
administration sent Energy Secretary Bill Richardson off to the
Middle East to push for a decision to produce more. For now, at
least, all signs do point to such a move, , easing the yearlong
shortage if not eliminating it. In the last week, prices have
fallen back from their $34 peak, thanks to a Saudi-Iranian
agreement to seek a production hike.
</P>
<P>
   One thing going for the Americans as they seek a price rollback
is the knowledge that the oil producers' unity last year was
exceptional _ a product of cooperation not just among OPEC members
but by non-OPEC members like Mexico and Norway, whose economies
also suffered when prices fell too low. Now the situation is
reversed, and Americans can argue that if oil prices choke the U.S.
economy, the producers will be damaging their most important
customer, on which the entire global economy and their hopes for
economic partnership rely.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson made that case on a two-week trip last month in which
he met with top Saudi and Kuwaiti officials. He has also made it in
meetings with other oil producers, including Venezuela, a member of
the cartel, as well as Mexico and Norway. Those last two have
already signaled a receptiveness to the U.S. argument, and neither
is expected to sign on to renewed OPEC production limits, making
them much harder to enforce.
</P>
<P>
   Still, despite Richardson's entreaties, at least some OPEC
countries _ particularly price hawks like Iraq, Libya and Algeria _
have so far remained reluctant to tamper much with a strategy that
restored their upper hand after years of budget shortfalls that
they traced to low oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   What many remember with trepidation is what happened after a
meeting in Jakarta in 1997, the last time the cartel agreed to a
big production increase. The price of oil plunged, ultimately to
well below $10 a barrel. That is what set the stage for last year's
production cutback.

   This time, no one is sure how far the countries will be prepared
to go. The experts' best guess so far is a quota hike of about 1
million barrels a day _ less than half of the 2 million to 2.5
million barrels a day that Energy Department statisticians say will
be needed to meet world demand.
</P>
<P>
   Based on that scenario, the department's Energy Information
Agency still predicts that U.S. gasoline prices will turn higher
before there is any sign of relief. The national average, now at
$1.53 a gallon, is now projected to peak at between $1.56 and $1.80
a gallon sometime in May. And though prices would then begin to
turn down, it is highly unlikely that the average price would drop
below $1.30 a gallon by Election Day, said Jay Hakes, the agency's
director
</P>
<P>
   That sets the scenes for a long summer and autumn in which high
gas prices could become an even bigger part of American life and
the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Republicans have rushed to exploit what they see as a
chink in Gore's economic armor.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said he would have pressed harder to persuade OPEC
countries to ``turn on the spigots,'' and said he is considering a
call to repeal a 4.3 cent federal gasoline tax approved in 1993 as
part of President Clinton's economic plan, for which Gore cast the
tie-breaking vote in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   A Gore spokesman, Douglas Hattaway, said: ``The administration
is in tough negotiations with the OPEC countries, and that is where
the solution lies.'' One Republican, Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa,
is calling for cuts in aid and arms sales to OPEC members, on
grounds that the organization is seeking a stranglehold on the
world economy. So far, though, the two presidential candidates have
steered clear of such table-thumping.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps tellingly, the Clinton administration chose last week to
extend a new olive branch to Iran, a major adversary for 21 years
but also a pivotal member of OPEC. Last year, its cooperation with
Saudi Arabia in clamping down on production was crucial in the
decision to squeeze oil supplies. This year, it and Saudi Arabia
seem likely to play precisely the opposite role.
</P>
<P>
   News of the gesture to Iran immediately provoked criticism from
some Republicans on grounds that Iran remains on America's list of
terrorist nations. But, then, it was also a week when the
television news was showing some gas prices hitting $2 a gallon.

<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ What best represents the tensions that await Pope
John Paul II when he arrives on Tuesday for a momentous six-day
pilgrimage to ``the lion's den,'' as an Israeli magazine cover
labeled the Holy Land?
</P>
<P>
   Is it the Islamic mufti's refusal to attend an interfaith
gathering convened by the pope because the Israeli chief rabbi will
be there? (A last-minute substitute sheik was found.)
</P>
<P>
   Is it the brouhaha in Israel after the Star of David was erased
from the ambulance that will travel in the pope's entourage, though
it is customary to remove insignia wherever he travels?
</P>
<P>
   Is it the Palestinian assertion that the pope's visit to a
refugee camp will signal Vatican support for the right of
Palestinian refugees to return to their former homes in Israel?
</P>
<P>
   Or is it perhaps the heaping garbage that surrounded the
Basilica of the Annunciation in Nazareth until late last week?
Fearing a fetid embarrassment, the Israeli government reluctantly
paid the indebted city to settle a strike so that the trash mounds
could be removed from the site where tradition says the archangel
Gabriel told Mary she was pregnant with Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   For John Paul, 79, this pilgrimage is a deeply spiritual climax
of a 22-year papacy during which he never visited Jesus'
birthplace, walked in his footsteps or prayed at the site believed
to hold his tomb.
</P>
<P>
   (He did make a previous pilgrimage, however, in 1963, and Pope
Paul VI, never uttering the word Israel, made a 12-hour stop in the
Jewish state in 1964.)
</P>
<P>
   As the first official visit of a pope to Israel, it is also the
culmination of John Paul's long effort to redefine the way the
church sees Jews _ as ``elder brothers'' rather than traitors _ and
to reconcile Jews and Catholics. For many Israelis who stopped to
gape on President Street last week, the sight of the Vatican's
yellow and white flags being hoisted to flutter beside the Israeli
Stars of David was a breathtaking, history-making image.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing is purely spiritual or brotherly in a land where
religion and politics are permanently entwined, almost embedded in
the sandstone that has borne witness to millenniums of turbulent
history. And so the pope's visit is freighted with multiple layers
of sensitivities, and each stop on his carefully negotiated
itinerary means different things to different people with different
agendas.
</P>
<P>
   So many of the steps he makes will be on diplomatic eggshells,
tuning out the claims and counterclaims of sovereignty, religious
rights and nationalism. There is the recent claim by Yasser Arafat,
the Palestinian leader, that the apostle Peter should be considered
a Palestinian, for instance. And then there is the rabbis' demand _
unmet _ that the Vatican cancel a Mass in Nazareth on the Feast of
the Annunciation because it falls on the Jewish Sabbath.
</P>
<P>
   The pope's schedule was carefully balanced: a visit to Yad
Vashem, the Holocaust memorial site, in Jerusalem, and a visit to
the Dehaisheh refugee camp in Bethlehem; a meeting with the chief
rabbis, a meeting with the mufti (who agreed to see the pope
without the rabbis.)
</P>
<P>
   But demands are being made for even more symmetry. Since the
pope has recognized the enormity of the Holocaust, Islamic
religious leaders say he should acknowledge the atrocities
committed during the Crusades, too. ``He has asked forgiveness from
the Jews, so he should ask forgiveness from the Muslims,'' said
Sheik Ikrima Sabri, the mufti, who heads the Higher Islamic
Council.
</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul will arrive in Tel Aviv on Tuesday evening as
Israelis, dressed in costumes, will be celebrating the festive
holiday of Purim. A parade to mark this proud, raucous holiday of
Jewish survival will be led by a float featuring a 12-foot-high
figure of John Paul. That is, unless the ultra-Orthodox Shas Party
succeeds in having it banned as what one Shas member called a way
of ``debasing ourselves before the goyim,'' or non-Jews.
</P>
<P>
   More than 60,000 pilgrims _ 45,000 on special charters _ will
fly in from around the world to accompany the pope. They will join
a very small group of Roman Catholic faithful in Israel and the
Palestinian territories. Counts vary, but combined Palestinian and
Israeli statistics suggest that 180,000 Christians are in the Holy
Land, and many of them are Eastern Orthodox.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the numbers, the Christian population of the Holy Land
has dwindled because of emigration and accounts for about 2 percent
of the overall population, down from 13 percent in 1900. This
raises another agenda for the pope, one that is more germane to his
trip. Many Palestinian Catholics want a heightened incentive _ like
a papal appeal _ to soldier on as the guardians of the faith in the
Holy Land.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian Christians in general, while they welcome the
spotlight on their existence, do not want to be mistaken for the
pope's faithful or those who must make amends for anti-Semitism.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is not representing the local Christian community but the
Western church,'' said Michael Karayanni, a Greek Orthodox,
Palestinian law professor who lives in Jerusalem. ``Religious
tensions between Christians and Jews are not felt here. Political
tensions, yes. But there isn't much anti-Semitism in our
community.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope will devote a full day to the Palestinian-governed
Bethlehem area.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, a Muslim, has assiduously courted the pope and
aggressively moved to propose the Palestinians as less ambivalent
caretakers than the Israelis for Christian holy places in the Holy
Land.
</P>
<P>
   For Arafat, the pope's visit is a tremendous coup, an on-site
and almost unrivaled affirmation of Palestinian sovereignty. To
have the pope make simultaneous first visits to Israel and the
Palestinians suggests a kind of equivalency of recognition that the
Palestinians have long sought from the world.

</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians are, comparatively speaking, ahead of the game.
The Vatican established diplomatic ties with Israel in 1993, 45
years after the country was founded. Before a Palestinian state has
even been established, the Vatican has recognized Palestinian
aspirations and did so more strongly than ever in a new agreement
last month, irking Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``This visit reaffirms the Vatican's longtime support for the
legitimate rights of the Palestinian people,'' said Emile Jarjoui,
a senior official of the Palestine Liberation Organization. ``His
visit to the Dehaisheh refugee camp is a clear message that the
suffering of refugees should end and their cause needs a just
solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Israelis have grown up suspicious of Christians and many
are ignorant about Christianity. The Israeli textbooks'
presentation of Catholicism leaves off more than 35 years ago,
before Vatican II discarded dogma that blamed Jews for the death of
Christ. It ends with Pope Pius XII's failure to speak out publicly
against the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   ``The textbooks ignore decades of profound transformation in the
church's attitude toward Jews,'' said Rabbi Ron Kronish, director
of the Inter-Religious Coordinating Council in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   At a forum last week in Jerusalem, Rabbi David Rosen, local
director of the Anti-Defamation League, was asked skeptically how
deep the transformation really went. ``Well, as the pope said to
me, in my eleventh visit to the Vatican, as we were being served a
glatt kosher meal,'' the rabbi said, pausing for emphasis because
he felt part of his point was already made.
</P>
<P>
   The ultra-Orthodox are largely indifferent to the pope's visit
while a small number of religious extremists are openly
antagonistic. A scrawl on the rabbinate building last week
screamed, ``Don't meet with the pope!'' But polls show that most
Israelis view the pope's visit favorably, even if they question the
potential for profound reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   Most are far more interested in the political than the religious
significance of the trip, especially the pope's handling of
Jerusalem's status. But they perceive the pope to be a positive
force, and he is widely portrayed here as having done more than any
other Christian leader ``in 2,000 years'' to reach out to the Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think his visit can change some attitudes in Jewish
communities toward Christians,'' said Moshe Hellinger, a modern
Orthodox Jew and political scientist at Bar Ilan University. ``But
it depends how firmly he says things. Remember, Jews are afraid
that Christians feel compelled to convert us. As long as the church
doesn't say firmly that we don't want to convert Jews, no serious
dialogue will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope's visit to Yad Vashem will be watched closely by many
Israelis who want to hear the pope apologize more concretely than
previously for the church's wartime silence and for its role in
fostering the anti-Semitism that fed the Nazi demonization of Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli political leaders have commented little about the visit,
which represents an overwhelming logistical and security
undertaking for the state. Some, like Shlomo Ben Ami, the internal
security minister, see it as an opportunity to demonstrate to the
world that Israel is a tolerant, open society. Most, however, give
the impression that their aspiration, as one senior security
official said, ``is to get through it without a disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope hoped keenly to bring together the three Abrahamic
faiths during his trip. But even this well-intentioned goal bumped
up against the tensions of the place.
</P>
<P>
   First the chief rabbi objected, because he did not want to enter
a church complex for the interfaith meeting. Later, he was
persuaded after learning that the gathering would not be held in
the church itself.
</P>
<P>
   The mufti, on the other hand, started with a positive attitude
and then apparently underwent a change of heart, said Monsignor
Eugene Nugent of the apostolic delegation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not see a need to meet with Jewish religious leaders,''
Sheik Sabri said in an interview. ``Meeting with them at this time
will make it appear as if everything is normal in Jerusalem, when
in reality it is not. There is an occupation and it should be clear
that there is no peace in the city.''

for Sunday, March 19, moved Saturday.

   This final budget adds ECON-STOCKS-REVIEW.
</P>
<P>
   On the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   (Moved in the `a' category)
</P>
<P>
   OIL-POLITICS-REVIEW (Washington) _ OPEC has displayed startling
muscle in the past year, sending oil and gasoline prices soaring.
Whether the oil cartel continues on this course will touch directly
on American wallets and politics, by determining just what kinds of
prices American voters confront all spring and summer and into the
fall, right up to Election Day. Little wonder, then, that oil is
quickly becoming an issue in the race between George W. Bush and Al
Gore. By Douglas Jehl.
</P>
<P>
   HI-TECH-DOOMSDAY-REVIEW (Undated) _ Amazing advances in
computers, genetics and other sectors of high technology have led
many enthusiasts to predict the dawn of vast new information-age
utopias. Given the hype and relentless optimism, perhaps it's not
surprising that serious scientists and researchers have begun to
explore darker, less inviting visions of the future. A look at some
high-tech doomsday scenarios involving robotics, nanotechnology and
genetic engineering. By John Markoff.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moved in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   COACHES-MIKES-REVIEW (Undated) _ The never-ending rush for
``inside access'' to sports personalities hit a speed bump last
week: Several NBA coaches risked fines by refusing a league edict
to wear microphones during games. Their reasoning was that as much
as fans would love to hear snippets of how they sketched out that
last pick-and-roll or lit a fire under a sullen superstar, some
parts of their jobs can't be done properly with the specter of
millions of eavesdroppers. Rather than embrace what the media can
do for them, they fear what it can do TO them. By Alan Schwarz.
</P>
<P>
   L.A.-TRANSFORM-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ The sale of the Los
Angeles Times drove home the reality that Los Angeles' old civic
architecture has been largely dismantled in recent years, with no
one quite sure what will replace it. By selling its company, the
Chandler family seemed to acknowledge that it no longer had a stake
in a city it helped build, and that _ no longer dominated by a
white majority, shorn of most of its old-line corporate giants, and
whose public school students predominantly speak English as a
second language _ no longer needed them. By James Sterngold.
</P>
<P>
   MOST-WANTED-REVIEW (Washington) _ The FBI marked the 50th
anniversary of its 10 Most Wanted list with pride and purpose, and
a touch of nostalgia. Of 458 people who have made the list, 429
have been caught, with several choosing to go down shooting it out
with their would-be captors. Cases against 15 people who were never
caught were eventually dropped, and another four fugitives were
removed from the list because others were deemed more deserving. A
look at some of the more famous cases. By David Stout.
</P>
<P>
   GASOLINE-MOTORISTS-REVIEW (Detroit) _ Car drivers probably feel
avenged when they see a hulking sport utility vehicle lumber up to
a gas station. Every bing and clank from the pump is another
reminder of the higher cost of filling a gas guzzler: up to $70 for
the biggest models. But higher gas prices actually hurt car owners
more than SUV owners, who tend to have higher higher incomes. Could
this disparity translate into voting patterns? By Keith Bradsher.
</P>
<P>
   CENSUS-RACE-REVIEW (Washington) _ The U.S. racial and ethnic mix
is undergoing radical change, and this is reflected on the census
forms that are being mailed to more than 120 million households
this month. A look at some of the race/ethnic questions on the form
and the politics behind them. By Steven A. Holmes.
</P>
<P>
   ECON-STOCKS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Just when the dull old stocks
that used to dominate the economy appeared to be dead in the water,
they took off with a vengeance last week. The old economy lives _
but will its stocks continue to thrive? By Floyd Norris.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Moved in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   BRITAIN-FITNESS-REVIEW (London) _ Even among the Britons who go
to health clubs to work out, there is often a lackadaisical
attitude toward fitness and health. Most of the truly
body-conscious gym-goers are foreigners. Most Britons would freely
confess that they don't care much about their physiques, and that
they don't want to give up the sort of habits that would upset the
U.S. surgeon general. Just as it is no surprise that many Americans
are clinically obese, it is no surprise that, by many standards,
Britons are stunningly unhealthy, and proud of it. By Sarah Lyall.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-TAIWAN-ARMS-REVIEW (Shanghai) _ There's been much talk of
war between China and Taiwan recently, but the rhetoric obscures
the fact that military preparations remain modest in both countries
and are likely to stay that way. While China has slightly beefed up
its arsenal against Taiwan, there has been no dramatic increase in
spending that would signal a shift toward a war economy, since
China is not yet willing to risk the cost to its economic growth.
That may explain the increase in saber-rattling. By Craig Smith.
</P>
<P>
   IRAN-TENSIONS-REVIEW (Undated) _ After 21 stressful years of
living under the clerical dictatorship imposed by the Islamic
revolution that overthrew the shah, most Iranians would happily
settle for a more normal life. But last week, just as they were
celebrating the reformist landslide in February's parliamentary
elections and the hope it brought of a peaceful progression towards
a more democratic society, an assassin's bullet on a Tehran street
provided a shocking reminder of how grim and uncertain a struggle
may yet lie ahead. By John F. Burns.
</P>
<P>
   POPE-MUSLIMS-REVIEW (Rome) _ When Pope John Paul II goes to the
Middle East this week to begin a Holy Year pilgrimage to retrace
the steps of Jesus, he will pursue his longtime dream of
reconciling Christians and Muslims after centuries of hostility and
mistrust. A look at the history of relations between the Catholic
Church and Islam. By Alessandra Stanley.

   SHANGHAI, China _ There's been plenty of talk of war between
China and Taiwan recently. And tensions could intensify now that
Taiwan's presidential election was won Saturday by Chen Shui-bian,
who has advocated Taiwan's independence. But the oratory obscures a
more concrete calculus _ one based not on missile throw-weight but
on dollars and cents. By that calculus, preparations on both sides
of the Taiwan Strait remain modest and, according to the experts,
will most likely stay that way.
</P>
<P>
   While China has been modestly beefing up its arsenal against
Taiwan in hopes of eventually forcing the island to negotiate
reunification with the mainland, there has been no dramatic
increase in spending that would signal a shift toward a war
economy.
</P>
<P>
   One part of the calculus is that in the long run, China can much
better afford a future arms race than Taiwan, but is not yet
willing to risk the cost to its economic growth. That casts some
light on why China has so far been willing to raise the decibel
level of its threats against Taiwan, without dramatically
increasing its preparations for a shooting war.
</P>
<P>
   Of course China is modernizing its army, as can be expected of a
country its size. But that has been known for some time, and the
pace of that modernization remains slow. There is no concerted
attempt, for example, to build the kind of amphibious fleet that
would be needed to transport an invasion force across the narrow
strait _ a project that could take a decade to complete. And
China's military spending is still only about a tenth of what the
United States spends, or less than 2 percent of the country's gross
domestic product. The Soviet Union, by contrast, spent more than 20
percent of its GDP on defense at the height of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   China has preferred instead to put general economic development
ahead of military development, following Deng Xiaoping's maxim that
national strength derives from the economy rather than the barrel
of a gun. The strategy has served China well in recent years as the
government ramped up infrastructure spending to slow a slide in
economic growth, something it might not have been as free to do had
military spending commanded a larger share of the national budget.
</P>
<P>
   China's military spending has been increasing in recent years _
a sizable ship costs several billion dollars _ but the country is
reluctant to allow its army to grow overly dependent on any outside
supplier, least of all a historically unstable ally such as Russia,
its main source of foreign arms today.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, stepping up domestic arms production would
present problems of its own. China's domestic arms industry has
proven abysmal by most measures in areas other than missile, tank
and artillery production. The country has been working since the
early 1980s to develop a high-tech fighter, the F-10, but has only
recently got prototypes into the air.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say that China isn't seeking to create a genuine
military threat with which to scare Taiwan into serious talks.
Toward this end, the country has bought from Russia two Sovremenny
guided missile destroyers and four diesel electric Kilo-class
submarines. It has bought 48 SU-27 advanced fighter jets and has
begun assembling kits for 200 more. And it has agreed to buy still
more advanced SU-30s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our preparation for war against Taiwan's independence will not
stop, regardless of what happens in Taiwan, because we have to
prepare for the worst situation,'' says Shen Dingli, an arms
control expert at Fudan University here. ``If the U.S. gives Taiwan
more weapons,'' he adds, ``this will fan an arms race, but it is an
arms race China can afford.''
</P>
<P>
   On that count, Shen appears to be right. China could easily
double domestic defense spending without putting an undue strain on
its economy. And its fat foreign reserves, which at $155 billion
are the largest in the world after Japan's, could pay for much of
what China needs from abroad if it wanted to decisively shift the
cross-strait balance of power in its favor.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not something China appears ready to do just yet.
Drawing down reserves would increase the country's cost of foreign
capital, weaken its currency and further delay economic reforms
that depend on eventual convertibility of the yuan. And domestic
weapons spending would widen the country's budget deficit and
divert resources needed to keep the overall economy plugging along.
</P>
<P>
   There are other constraints on accelerating the buildup as well.
</P>
<P>
   Both armies, for example, are already struggling to absorb
sophisticated arms they can't yet use. This means, on both sides of
the strait, that any commitment to new systems stretches out the
time frame for an arms race _ and for investing in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if China did begin a crash program on some systems, which
they haven't begun in my view, it will take at least four to six
years for the new systems to enter the inventory,'' says David
Shambaugh, a specialist on the Chinese military at George
Washington University. He says it will be several years before
China can confidently wield the recently purchased Russian
destroyers in a conflict.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, experts say, China is likely to opt for a far cheaper
and more focused buildup, one that Taiwan will find itself hard
pressed to outrun. Already, the mainland possesses enough
short-range ballistic missiles to overwhelm Taiwan's defenses. That
raises the possibility that the United States might develop a
broader missile defense system and apply it to Taiwan. But then
China could just build more missiles, which cost a fraction of what
it costs to shoot them down.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of the threat of a missile attack, Taiwan has
requested more powerful arms from the United States _ most recently
destroyers equipped with Aegis anti-missile systems and Tomahawk
cruise missiles with a striking range well beyond the width of the
narrow strait. But here the United States may well think twice,
because increasing the weaponry in the strait could increase the
risk of accidental conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, neither side has an air-to-air or cruise missile with a
range of more than 40 miles and that creates a buffer, it gives
them time to think,'' says Larry Wortzel, a retired U.S. Army
colonel and former military attache in Beijing who is now at the
Heritage Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   And given the economic calculus, pushing China into an arms race
is likely only to erode the considerable potential for constructive
political dialogue. That potential is also better understood by
following economic logic, with Taiwanese businesses having invested
more than $40 billion in the mainland and showing interest in
investing more.

<P>
   ``In the end, weapons are not going to solve this problem for
either side,'' says Bates Gill, an expert on Chinese weapons at the
Brookings Institution. ``The attention of all sides needs to focus
like a laser beam on the difficult choices of a political answer,
not the easy choices of more weapons and more bluster.''  &QL;

<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ There's been plenty of talk of war between
China and Taiwan recently. And tensions could intensify now that
Taiwan's presidential election was won Saturday by Chen Shui-bian,
who has advocated Taiwan's independence. But the oratory obscures a
more concrete calculus _ one based not on missile throw-weight but
on dollars and cents. By that calculus, preparations on both sides
of the Taiwan Strait remain modest and, according to the experts,
will most likely stay that way.
</P>
<P>
   While China has been modestly beefing up its arsenal against
Taiwan in hopes of eventually forcing the island to negotiate
reunification with the mainland, there has been no dramatic
increase in spending that would signal a shift toward a war
economy.
</P>
<P>
   One part of the calculus is that in the long run, China can much
better afford a future arms race than Taiwan, but is not yet
willing to risk the cost to its economic growth. That casts some
light on why China has so far been willing to raise the decibel
level of its threats against Taiwan, without dramatically
increasing its preparations for a shooting war.
</P>
<P>
   Of course China is modernizing its army, as can be expected of a
country its size. But that has been known for some time, and the
pace of that modernization remains slow. There is no concerted
attempt, for example, to build the kind of amphibious fleet that
would be needed to transport an invasion force across the narrow
strait _ a project that could take a decade to complete. And
China's military spending is still only about a tenth of what the
United States spends, or less than 2 percent of the country's gross
domestic product. The Soviet Union, by contrast, spent more than 20
percent of its GDP on defense at the height of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   China has preferred instead to put general economic development
ahead of military development, following Deng Xiaoping's maxim that
national strength derives from the economy rather than the barrel
of a gun. The strategy has served China well in recent years as the
government ramped up infrastructure spending to slow a slide in
economic growth, something it might not have been as free to do had
military spending commanded a larger share of the national budget.
</P>
<P>
   China's military spending has been increasing in recent years _
a sizable ship costs several billion dollars _ but the country is
reluctant to allow its army to grow overly dependent on any outside
supplier, least of all a historically unstable ally such as Russia,
its main source of foreign arms today.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, stepping up domestic arms production would
present problems of its own. China's domestic arms industry has
proven abysmal by most measures in areas other than missile, tank
and artillery production. The country has been working since the
early 1980s to develop a high-tech fighter, the F-10, but has only
recently got prototypes into the air.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say that China isn't seeking to create a genuine
military threat with which to scare Taiwan into serious talks.
Toward this end, the country has bought from Russia two Sovremenny
guided missile destroyers and four diesel electric Kilo-class
submarines. It has bought 48 SU-27 advanced fighter jets and has
begun assembling kits for 200 more. And it has agreed to buy still
more advanced SU-30s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our preparation for war against Taiwan's independence will not
stop, regardless of what happens in Taiwan, because we have to
prepare for the worst situation,'' says Shen Dingli, an arms
control expert at Fudan University here. ``If the U.S. gives Taiwan
more weapons,'' he adds, ``this will fan an arms race, but it is an
arms race China can afford.''
</P>
<P>
   On that count, Shen appears to be right. China could easily
double domestic defense spending without putting an undue strain on
its economy. And its fat foreign reserves, which at $155 billion
are the largest in the world after Japan's, could pay for much of
what China needs from abroad if it wanted to decisively shift the
cross-strait balance of power in its favor.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not something China appears ready to do just yet.
Drawing down reserves would increase the country's cost of foreign
capital, weaken its currency and further delay economic reforms
that depend on eventual convertibility of the yuan. And domestic
weapons spending would widen the country's budget deficit and
divert resources needed to keep the overall economy plugging along.
</P>
<P>
   There are other constraints on accelerating the buildup as well.
</P>
<P>
   Both armies, for example, are already struggling to absorb
sophisticated arms they can't yet use. This means, on both sides of
the strait, that any commitment to new systems stretches out the
time frame for an arms race _ and for investing in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if China did begin a crash program on some systems, which
they haven't begun in my view, it will take at least four to six
years for the new systems to enter the inventory,'' says David
Shambaugh, a specialist on the Chinese military at George
Washington University. He says it will be several years before
China can confidently wield the recently purchased Russian
destroyers in a conflict.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, experts say, China is likely to opt for a far cheaper
and more focused buildup, one that Taiwan will find itself hard
pressed to outrun. Already, the mainland possesses enough
short-range ballistic missiles to overwhelm Taiwan's defenses. That
raises the possibility that the United States might develop a
broader missile defense system and apply it to Taiwan. But then
China could just build more missiles, which cost a fraction of what
it costs to shoot them down.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of the threat of a missile attack, Taiwan has
requested more powerful arms from the United States _ most recently
destroyers equipped with Aegis anti-missile systems and Tomahawk
cruise missiles with a striking range well beyond the width of the
narrow strait. But here the United States may well think twice,
because increasing the weaponry in the strait could increase the
risk of accidental conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, neither side has an air-to-air or cruise missile with a
range of more than 40 miles and that creates a buffer, it gives
them time to think,'' says Larry Wortzel, a retired U.S. Army
colonel and former military attache in Beijing who is now at the
Heritage Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   And given the economic calculus, pushing China into an arms race
is likely only to erode the considerable potential for constructive
political dialogue. That potential is also better understood by
following economic logic, with Taiwanese businesses having invested
more than $40 billion in the mainland and showing interest in
investing more.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, weapons are not going to solve this problem for
either side,'' says Bates Gill, an expert on Chinese weapons at the
Brookings Institution. ``The attention of all sides needs to focus
like a laser beam on the difficult choices of a political answer,
not the easy choices of more weapons and more bluster.''  &QL;

<P>
   OTAY MESA, Calif. _ Behind five barbed-wire fences, four
identification checkpoints, two guard towers and one 50,000-volt
electric fence sits one of the few remaining solutions to America's
tightest labor market in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Every weekday, some 100 prisoners report for work at one of
three private companies here at the Richard J. Donovan Correctional
Facility, a series of squat buildings hidden among the hills at the
base of Otay Mountain, just 5 miles from the Mexican border. The
men, convicted murderers and robbers among them, stitch T-shirts,
recycle tires and make wine and beer vats.
</P>
<P>
   Other than the workers' uniformly blue outfits and the armed
guards who occasionally patrol the factory floors, the workplace
looks quite normal. A radio plays the Beatles' ``Here Comes the
Sun.'' Hunched over sewing machines or welding together stainless
steel vats, the men earn about $5.75 an hour, the California
minimum wage. The products end up in trendy clothing stores and
upscale brew pubs.
</P>
<P>
   With unemployment low and a record number of Americans behind
bars, prison labor is coming to mean much more than painting
license plates. As inmates undertake everything from telemarketing
to the manufacturing of computer circuit boards and furniture, the
change has caused a growing debate, playing out in state
legislatures and in two bills before Congress, over the role the
nation's 2 million prisoners should play in its economy.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, more than 80,000 inmates now hold
traditional jobs, working for governments or private companies and
earning 25 cents to $7 an hour. The private sector programs, which
exist in 36 states and employ 3,500, have doubled in size since
1995 after years of almost no growth. And the federal program that
employs 21,000 inmates, up 14 percent in the last two years, and
that has $600 million in annual sales, is seeking to expand.
</P>
<P>
   Both supporters and opponents agree the debate is at a critical
juncture because employment in prisons could spread quickly in the
coming years. On virtually every other question, however _ whether
prison labor helps inmates or is cruel to them, whether it is an
economic benefit or a force holding down wages _ the two sides
differ vehemently.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the employment of inmates include law enforcement
officials who view the programs as a way to reform convicts and
business groups who see inexpensive labor. Many prisoners want to
work, the backers say, noting that research has shown that inmates
who work are less likely to commit crimes when they are released.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a problem for corrections officers to have prisoners
without anything constructive to do,'' said Edwin Meese, the former
U.S. attorney general, who lobbies for expanded inmate labor as
chairman of the Enterprise Prison Institute, a Bethesda, Md.,
research group financed by state grants, research centers and
private companies.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, supporters say, prisoners offer the ultimate in a
flexible and dependable work force. ``If I lay them off for a
week,'' said Pierre Sleiman, the owner of the T-shirt company at
Donovan, referring to his workers, ``I don't have to worry about
someone else coming and saying, `Come work for me.'''
</P>
<P>
   To opponents, inmate labor is both a potential human rights
abuse and a threat to workers outside prison walls. Inmates have no
bargaining power and are easily exploited, the critics say. In one
California lawsuit, for example, two prisoners have sued both their
employer and the prison, saying they were put in solitary
confinement after complaining about working conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The opponents also say the programs have stolen jobs from
outside workers and hold down wages for other workers. Inmate
labor, said Gordon Lafer, a political science professor at the
University of Oregon, ``is a decent-sized problem that is poised to
explode.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the companies now in the program are small. Earlier in
the 1990s, big companies like AT&AMP;T and Microsoft hired inmates, but
most backed away after the arrangements were exposed. Some big
companies, like thre retailer Target Corp., still use suppliers
that employ prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Prison labor in the United States has its roots in the 1800s,
when inmates worked for private companies without pay. After
hundreds died on the job because of hazardous conditions, unions
and prison reformers demanded a halt the practice.
</P>
<P>
   In 1934, however, federal prison officials concerned about
growing unrest in prisons lobbied to create a work program.
Companies got involved again in 1979, when Congress passed a law
allowing them to hire prisoners in some circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For most of the last two decades, the programs remained tiny.
But the tough drug and sentencing laws of the 1980s helped increase
the number of Americans behind bars by 80 percent, to 2 million, in
a decade. The unemployment rate, meanwhile, was falling.``Now the
economy is very good, and businesses are looking to the prison
system for labor,'' said Noreen Blonien, an assistant director of
the California Department of Corrections.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the federal Bureau of Prisons hope the same logic
will enable them to expand their program, the nation's largest, to
include private-sector jobs like those at Donovan. Rep. Bill
McCollum, R-Fla., has offered a bill that would allow the bureau to
do so, as long as the companies hiring inmates could show they were
not moving existing jobs behind bars. The jobs would also pay more
than the 21 cents to $1.15 an hour that the inmates now in the
program earn.
</P>
<P>
   A competing bill, meanwhile, from Rep. Pete Hoekstra, R-Mich.,
could cause the federal program to scale back by forcing it to
compete with private companies for the government contracts it now
fills.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you end up with, in certain cases, is the federal
government getting inferior products at higher prices, `` said
Hoekstra, who has the support of both the U.S. Chamber of Commerce
and the AFL-CIO.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, the lawmakers' aides have discussed a combined
bill that would both force state-run prison operations to compete
with private enterprises and allow companies to hire federal
inmates. ``We're very close to a compromise,'' McCollum said. If
they cannot reach one, the lawmakers say they will offer their
bills separately.
</P>
<P>
   Away from Washington, the debate over inmates working for
private companies is less hypothetical.
</P>
<P>
   One business employing inmates is CMT Blues, a T-shirt company
here in the southwesternmost corner of the United States, and it
has been home to virtually every argument on both sides of the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, in nearby Chula Vista, Sleiman was running a
business that imported clothing, and he was considering opening his
own operation. He was looking to Honduras, he said, where workers
earn about $1.75 an hour. ``In our industry, all of the business is
going offshore,'' Sleiman said. Then he heard about California's
prison work program. Under it, Sleiman would have to pay the
inmates $5.75 an hour, but he could make up some of the expense
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   For CMT's factory, Sleiman pays less than a fifth of what he
would elsewhere in rent and electricity. He also receives a 25
percent discount on workers' compensation insurance and tax
credits.
</P>
<P>
   The California operation, Sleiman determined, would be cheaper
than operating elsewhere in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But he soon found out that setting up shop in a prison is no
panacea. Delivery and pickup times must be scheduled precisely.
Sleiman also trained many of the workers from scratch, he said.
Then he had to convince them to work together.
</P>
<P>
   ``On paper, it looked very good,'' Sleiman said. In reality, he
added, ``it has been a tough road.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been even tougher for the inmates, according to a lawsuit
filed last summer by two former Donovan prisoners. To work at CMT,
inmates had to go through a 60-day ``training period'' for which
they were not paid, according to the suit. It also says workers
were given unrealistic production quotas and were told to replace
``Made in Honduras'' labels on some fabric with `Made in the USA''
tags.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   After the inmates, Charles Ervin and Shearwood Fleming, got in
touch with a local television show and it broadcast their charges,
they were fired, put in solitary confinement for more than 45 days
and eventually transferred to another prison.
</P>
<P>
   Sleiman said the length of training programs varies, and the
accusations about quotas and the labels were untrue. A California
Department of Corrections investigation into the label-switching
charge was inconclusive, a state spokeswoman said. Prisoners
understood the conditions of the training program when they applied
to work at CMT, she added.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the problems, though, California prison officials said
the private-sector jobs remain far more popular among inmates than
washing sheets or even building government furniture. At most state
prisons where private companies operate, there are waiting lists to
be hired.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we step through the gates and into the shop,'' said Allen
W. Smith, 45, a T-shirt worker who is serving a 13-year sentence
for robbery, ``this is a company. This isn't prison.'' Guards still
keep watch, but the atmosphere differs greatly from prison yards,
the inmates said.
</P>
<P>
   The private sector jobs also pay at least the minimum wage,
although prisoners in most states keep only a fraction of their
pay.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with other jobs at Donovan, ``it's great,'' said Frank
W. Owen, 39, who was convicted of a 1982 murder and has worked for
CMT for four years. ``I've been able to save some money.''
</P>
<P>
   Owen also said he hoped his record at CMT will help him earn
parole.
</P>
<P>
   Sleiman, meanwhile, said CMT was doing better now that he had
learned how to operate in a prison. Over the 18 months, he added,
he plans to triple his work force to 200. &QL;

   HYDERABAD, India _ Cyber Towers rises from the campus of a
software technology park, a sleek, Internet-connected symbol of the
new India that is feverishly courting foreign investment, selling
its wares in the global marketplace and creating wealth at an
astonishing rate.
</P>
<P>
   But less than 50 miles away, in the poverty-stricken village of
Sheri Ram Reddy Guda, the old India is alive and unwell.
Illiteracy, sickness and hunger are the villagers' constant
companions. Women and children work in the fields for less than 50
cents a day. The sole telephone _ an antique contraption of
batteries and antennas _ almost never works.
</P>
<P>
   Like most of the villagers, Muhammad Hussain, an unlettered
field hand in a ragged loin cloth, has never seen a computer, but
said that he did once watch an office worker at a typewriter. ``I
saw the fingers moving, but I did not know what was being
written,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The chasm between India's educated elite and its impoverished
multitudes worries economists, politicians and some software
entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the extraordinary success of Indian engineers in
Silicon Valley and the Indian software industry's sales to American
companies, India and the United States have forged strong economic
ties in high technology. President Clinton will acknowledge those
links next Friday with a visit to Hitec City, where Microsoft,
Oracle and Metamor are comfortably ensconced in the air-conditioned
comfort of Cyber Towers.
</P>
<P>
   But during his five-day whirlwind tour of five Indian cities,
the president will spend little time in the villages where almost
three-quarters of this country's billion people still live and
struggle for the basic necessities.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when India's software industry is creating a glamorous
digerati and driving a dizzying escalation in stock values on the
Bombay exchange, the boom has stirred a debate about the country's
social and economic priorities, as well as the potential of high
technology to transform the lives of the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like Chandrababu Naidu, the chief minister of the southern
state of Andhra Pradesh, whose capital is this bustling, attractive
city, have an almost messianic faith in the power of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Though less than .05 percent of Indian households now have
Internet access, compared with over a third in the United States,
the optimists believe there will soon be technology that will make
connecting to the Net cheap enough for a broader spectrum of
Indians to afford.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a television in a school is connected to the Internet, you
can hold literacy classes in the evenings,'' said Randeep Sudan,
who oversees information technology issues for Naidu. ``You can
deliver the best of content to the worst of schools. Imagine the
potential to revolutionize the educational process.''
</P>
<P>
   But others worry that the boom may be distracting the country
from its chronic problems and fear that the past decade's more
rapid economic growth _ spawned by India's loosening of
restrictions on trade and investment _ is leaving the poor, and the
poorer states, further behind, even as the size of India's middle
class has doubled.
</P>
<P>
   This is still a country where half the women and a quarter of
the men cannot read or write; where more than half the children 4
and under are stunted by malnutrition; where one-third of the
population, or more than 300 million people, live in absolute
poverty, unable to afford enough to eat; where more than 30 million
children 6 to 10 are not in school.
</P>
<P>
   K.R. Narayanan, India's first president from an untouchable
caste, sounded an alarm in a recent speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have one of the world's largest reservoirs of technical
personnel, but also the world's largest number of illiterates,'' he
said, ``the world's largest middle class, but also the largest
number of people below the poverty line, and the largest number of
children suffering from malnutrition. Our giant factories rise from
out of squalor. Our satellites shoot up from the midst of hovels of
the poor.''
</P>
<P>
   Even those who believe that the importance of the $5 billion
software industry is overblown acknowledge its contributions. It
has generated 280,000 jobs for the educated and highly skilled.
Those workers, in turn, are creating demand for housing,
refrigerators and other goods that help the economy grow.
</P>
<P>
   And there is potential for greater growth. A study by McKinsey &AMP;
Co., the management consulting firm, forecasts that India's
software industry could earn $87 billion and employ 2.2 million
people before the decade is over.
</P>
<P>
   The success of the industry has also stirred optimism about
India's ability to compete in a global economy. It has offered
capitalist, free-market models in a country where the state still
plays a central role and has hastened the tendency of the country's
best and brightest young people to choose careers in business
rather than the civil service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every country needs a major success story to lift the psyche
and to be seen as a powerhouse in something,'' said Krishna G.
Palepu, a Harvard Business School professor who is bullish on the
industry. ``This is India's chance. Suddenly there's a sense of
self-confidence and visibility internationally.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are also limitations on what high technology can do to
increase the productivity of the entire Indian economy, at least
for now. The industry itself still generates only about 1 percent
of India's gross domestic product and about 1 percent of worldwide
software exports.
</P>
<P>
   The country desperately needs to attend to the fundamentals,
most economists say, and some state leaders like Naidu agree. It
must invest more in primary education and health care, they say, as
well as build a working system of roads and power grids, reduce
subsidies for power and fertilizer that go mostly to the
better-off, and generate higher rates of growth in agriculture and
industry, which employ eight in 10 Indians.
</P>
<P>
   India has lagged behind China, for instance, in educating its
children and increasing its exports of textiles, shoes and toys _
industries that employ huge numbers of less educated workers in
China. By law, India has required those industries to remain small,
typically employing fewer than 100 people per workplace _ putting
them at a tremendous disadvantage with China, where such factories
employ thousands.
</P>
<P>
   In the garment trade, India and China started in 1980 with about
the same level of exports, but by 1996 India was selling $4.6
billion of its goods abroad, compared with China's $25 billion.

</P>
<P>
   The Indian government is in dire need of revenue to tackle its
daunting ills, but so far the software industry is contributing
relatively little to the public coffers.
</P>
<P>
   Income from software exports is generally exempted from the 38.5
percent corporate income tax. And unlike companies in other
industries, high technology companies do not have to pay the 40 to
60 percent customs duties on computers and other technology items
that they import to operate their businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The software industry is making gobs and gobs of profits,''
said Anil Garg, an Indian and a Silicon Valley entrepreneur who is
setting up an office for AristaSoft, the new company he co-founded,
in Cyber Towers. ``And yet there is this huge debate about whether
it should pay taxes. I don't understand. Having taxes is a good
problem. The roads here are broken, for God's sake. The schools are
so bad. We have been the privileged class for so long. It's time
for us to pay back.''
</P>
<P>
   The software technology park of Hitec City and the village of
Sheri Ram Reddy Guda are separated by only a short distance, yet
seem to come from different centuries, and to stand at opposite
poles, emblems of the new and the old India.
</P>
<P>
   Hitec City is a temple to modernity, with a soaring atrium,
gurgling fountains, an on-site automatic teller machine, basement
car parking and Internet connections for all. The government has
created an island where everything works. There are three separate
power systems, ensuring that the lights will never go out. And the
businesses do not need decent roads: They can deliver their
products via satellite links or fiber-optic cables.
</P>
<P>
   Sheri Ram Reddy Guda, population 400, seems ancient by
comparison. No one here owns a car or even a scooter. The ox cart
is still the primary means of transportation, and word of mouth the
main grapevine. There is no health clinic, no cable TV. Raggedy
children, who should be in school, play in the dirt with toys made
from twisted wire.
</P>
<P>
   The village is connected to the main blacktop highway by a
narrow, mile-and-a-half-long dirt road, deeply gouged with ruts,
that is nearly impassable in the rainy season.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the villagers are from the formerly untouchable castes
now known as Dalits, and they are grateful to Naidu's government
for building 23 houses for them. But they say they desperately need
a better road, reliable electricity and jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The village gets only about eight hours of power a day, and that
is often of such low voltage that it does not operate the
irrigation pumps. When rain is scarce, as it is now, the fields lie
parched and work is scarce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chandrababu has not given us the current,'' said an old man,
Baswapuram Yelleah, referring to the chief minister and waving his
handmade hatchet as he gestured angrily with his hands. ``Our eyes
are filled with tears when we see our fields.''
</P>
<P>
   Yarrea Balamani is a widowed mother of five children, 7 to 18.
She and her older children do farm work but lately there have been
no more than 10 days of work in a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was some industry around, we could get work every
day,'' she said. ``That would be better for us. It's a very
difficult life we are living.''

MAN IN THE NEWS: CHEN SHUI-BIAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also TAIWAN-ELECTION, TAIWAN-VOTERS and CHINA-TAIWAN) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan _ People here who know Taiwan's president-elect,
Chen Shui-bian, often describe him as remote and impersonal. In
interviews, the 49-year-old politician comes across as almost
robotic, reciting policy positions with a blank gaze and a frozen
smile.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for many Taiwanese, not least those who swept him to victory
Saturday and ended more than 50 years of rule by the Nationalist
Party, Chen's public image was fixed by a supremely personal
tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   When Chen was greeting supporters at a rally in 1985 after
losing a county election, his wife, Wu Shu-jen, was hit by a truck.
Chen's supporters say the accident, which left Wu paralyzed from
the chest down, was politically motivated. Evidence to prove that
is sketchy, but it cemented Chen's reputation as a man who paid a
high price, and shoulders a heavy burden, for his beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two sides to the Taiwanese spirit: the fighter, and
those who want to maintain the good life,'' said Paul S.P. Hsu, a
lawyer here. ``Chen Shui-bian is a fighter.''
</P>
<P>
   Chen's grim determination has fueled a political career of
vertiginous highs and pitiful lows. And it has now made him
Taiwan's first leader from outside the long-ruling Nationalist
Party.
</P>
<P>
   Chen's Democratic Progressive Party formally favors an
independent Taiwan _ a position dangerously at odds with that of
China. Chen has said he will not declare independence, though it is
far from certain that this will mollify the leaders in Beijing, who
view Taiwan as a renegade province.
</P>
<P>
   Born on Feb. 18, 1951, in a farming village in southwestern
Taiwan, Chen is the son of illiterate parents who worked as day
laborers. Life for the Chen family was bleak. They lived in a mud
house with little furniture and the constant fear of destitution.
At school, the young Chen often went without lunch.
</P>
<P>
   But he was an extraordinarily diligent student, and education
became his ticket out of deprivation. He graduated from primary
school first in the country. In 1969, he enrolled in National
Taiwan University, where he studied law and graduated with yet more
accolades in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, Taiwan was still firmly under the grip of the
Nationalists _ followers of Chiang Kai-shek who fled China after
the Communist takeover in 1949 and established a government in
exile on the island. Chiang dreamed that Taiwan would reunify with
the mainland, and he brooked no dissent. Yet there were already
stirrings of an opposition movement, which advocated independence
for Taiwan. That movement would later became the Democratic
Progressive Party.
</P>
<P>
   As an ambitious young lawyer in the 1970s, Chen initially had
scant interest in politics. He joined a prestigious maritime law
firm and married Wu, the daughter of a wealthy doctor, in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Chen entered politics by accident in 1980. He was asked to
defend two pro-independence leaders who had been charged with
sedition, after a protest in the port city of Kaohsiung. To
nobody's surprise, in an island firmly controlled by the ruling
Nationalists, Chen lost the case. But his political senses were
piqued.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized this experience was not just a legal issue,'' he
said in an official biography published in 1998. ``I came to accept
the defendants' political arguments and ideals. I became a
believer. We should have two separate countries across the Taiwan _
one country on each side of the straits.''
</P>
<P>
   That belief was to become both the root of Chen's appeal and a
cudgel in the hands of his political enemies. Supporters,
particularly native Taiwanese, flocked to Chen. But the
Nationalists, and more recently the Chinese government, portrayed
the studious lawyer as a wild-eyed zealot who was intent on
dragging Taiwan into a dangerous and futile split from its Chinese
motherland.
</P>
<P>
   Chen began his political career with a successful bid for the
Taipei City Council, where he acquired a reputation as a crusader.
But his fortunes soon reversed. He lost a county-wide race in his
native Tainan County, and his wife was injured. Worse, in 1986, he
was jailed for eight months after losing a libel case filed by a
Nationalist official, whom he had accused of plagiarizing a
doctoral thesis.
</P>
<P>
   Chen's release from prison in 1987 coincided with the
Nationalist government's decision to suspend martial law and
legalize political parties. Chen joined the Democratic Progressive
Party, where his keen intellect and indefatigable work habits made
him a star.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Chen was elected mayor of Taipei, and swept into the
city like an avenging angel, shutting down its sex trade and
evicting apartment dwellers to build public parks. After a stormy
term, during which he managed to make enemies and alienate friends,
he was turned out of office.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts said the defeat matured Chen. Never the
zealot that his opponents claimed, Chen has now become a master of
political nuance. He recognizes that very few Taiwanese are willing
to risk their material well-being on a lunge for independence.
``You can see that he has basically abandoned the idea of a
Republic of Taiwan,'' Hsu said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the verbal traps that Chen must avoid in discussing
Taiwan and China may be one reason he is so programmed. In a recent
interview, Chen noted that he was the only candidate with a son who
would be drafted if Taiwan were invaded by China. ``As a father, I
understand the fear of parents who don't want to put their children
into danger,'' he said.

TAIWAN NATIONALISTS LOSE PRESIDENCY AFTER HALF-CENTURY REIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan _ Chen Shui-bian, an opposition politician who
long advocated Taiwan's independence, was elected its new president
Saturday, ending half a century of Nationalist rule and risking
dangerous new tensions with mainland China.
</P>
<P>
   Chen, a 49-year-old lawyer who served as mayor of Taipei and
struggled and against martial law in the 1980s, won with 39 percent
of the vote in a bitter three-way race. The Nationalist candidate
slumped to third place.
</P>
<P>
   Chen's victory, the first transition of power in Taiwan's young
democracy, was made possible by a schism in the Nationalist Party
that led one of its leaders, James Soong, to mount an independent
candidacy. Soong, a populist former governor of Taipei province,
came in second with a strong 37 percent showing; Vice President
Lien Chan, the Nationalist candidate, got just 23 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Chen and his Democratic Progressive Party called for
independence from the mainland, which considers Taiwan a wayward
region that must return to the motherland. The president-elect, who
will take office May 20, succeeding Taiwan's first elected
president, Lee Heng-tui, has recently moderated that position,
saying no declaration of independence is needed because Taiwan is
already sovereign.
</P>
<P>
   But Beijing has called Chen deceitful and issued dire warnings
against his election, with Prime Minister Zhu Rongji all but saying
last week that it could provoke a war.
</P>
<P>
   To reassure nervous citizens and governments abroad _ including
Washington, which has pledged to help Taiwan defend itself if
attacked _ Chen tried to reach out to the Chinese in his victory
speech Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   He avoided inflammatory references to Taiwanese ``statehood,''
and said he would seek deeper economic ties and ``a permanent
peace.'' He has promised he will not declare independence or hold a
referendum on the issue unless Taiwan comes under attack.
</P>
<P>
   However, in a statement certain to anger Beijing, he also
pledged, ``We won't let Taiwan become another Hong Kong or Macau.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In a brief statement read on Chinese television, Beijing said it
would adopt a wait-and-see attitude toward Taiwan's new leader, and
reiterated its view that Taiwan is part of Chinese territory.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, President Clinton said the election ``clearly
demonstrates the strength and vitality of Taiwan's democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the election provides a fresh opportunity for both
sides to reach out and resolve their differences peacefully through
dialogue,'' he said. ``The United States strongly supports such
dialogue and is committed to promoting peace, stability and
prosperity in the region.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Some 82 percent of Taiwan's voters turned out after a campaign
dominated by worries over relations with China and public
impatience with the corrupt political practices of the
Nationalists.
</P>
<P>
   Chen faces a legislature still dominated by the Nationalists,
who have ruled firmly since Chiang Kai-shek retreated here from the
Communist-dominated mainland in 1949. Taiwan is in for a period of
unprecedented political reshuffling and uncertainty, even as it
faces a possible confrontation with China.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Speaking to thousands of cheering supporters, Chen declared
Saturday night that his success ``is not a victory for the
Democratic Progressive Party _ it is a victory for democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   In a subtle friendly gesture to China and to some of his
fiercest enemies at home _ those who fled the mainland after the
Communist victory in 1949 _ Chen gave his acceptance speech in
Mandarin Chinese rather than in the Taiwanese dialect he often used
in campaign rallies.
</P>
<P>
   But Chen refuses to accept China's hallowed notion of ``One
China,'' and in answer to a question Saturday night he said China's
``one country, two systems'' formula for enlisting Taiwan as an
autonomous region ``would never be accepted by the Taiwanese
people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are determined to defend this island but we are also
determined to seek peace and stability,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to reassure foreign governments that he will not
take reckless actions, Chen has promised to retain the current
defense minister, top national security officials and the military
chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   Chen, like 85 percent of the island's population and many
supporters of his political party, is considered an ethnic
Taiwanese, descended from people who immigrated from the mainland
centuries ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Taiwanese resentment of the brutal takeover of their island
by Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists in the late 1940s eventually
spawned a dissident movement for democracy and independence. In the
1970s and '80s, early leaders of what would later become the
Democratic Progressive Party were imprisoned.
</P>
<P>
   Chen became involved as a defense lawyer for the dissidents and
then entered politics after martial law was lifted in 1987 and the
Democratic Progressives became the main opposition party. For many
of the party's supporters, Saturday night's victory is an emotional
culmination of decades of struggle.
</P>
<P>
   The Nationalists, for their part, have been thrown into turmoil
and their powerful chairman, President Lee Teng-hui, is now on the
spot. Lee's feud with Soong helped cause the devastating defeat and
the party could suffer a permanent split if the popular Soong tries
to form his own party now.
</P>
<P>
   Soong apologized to his supporters for losing, but did not say
whether he would seek to form a new party or try to take over the
Nationalist Party.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Already Saturday night, Huang Quen-huei, the secretary general
of the Nationalists, offered his resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Late Saturday night, a large crowd of Soong's supporters, most
of then longtime Nationalists who felt Lee had betrayed the party
by snubbing Soong, marched to Lee's official residence and his
party's headquarters in central Taipei to shout for Lee to step
down as party boss. Both buildings were surrounded by riot police
and there were some scuffles.
</P>
<P>
   Chen has called for public disclosure of the Nationalists'
multibillion-dollar investments and confiscation of any properties
that should belong to the state rather than the party.
</P>
<P>
   But Chen also said Saturday night that he bore no animosity
toward his campaign opponents and that he hoped to work with the
Nationalists to build a ``cross-party alliance,'' though he did not
offer specifics.
</P>
<P>
   His ability to forge a coalition will be crucial to his success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chen Shui-bian's immediate challenge is that he has to act as
a president, not just a leader of an opposition movement,'' said
Chu Yun-han, a political scientist at National Taiwan University.
``Nearly two-thirds of the electorate didn't vote for him, and many
are deeply suspicious of his approach to the mainland.''
</P>
<P>
   The defeated Nationalist candidate, Lien, had used scare tactics
in the final weeks of the campaign, suggesting that Chen could
bring disaster to the island.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night he was more gracious in conceding, calling the
transition a milestone for Taiwan's democracy. ``I hope the new
president will handle state matters properly, leading our country
into a new era,'' he said before a crestfallen line of party
leaders. ``We can still regroup. From today we need to engage in
self-examination and reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee remained silent and secluded in his residence, where he
summoned the military chief of staff and the defense minister.
There have been reports here of Chinese troop movements on the
mainland, although no one expects imminent military action.
</P>
<P>
   Chen's victory reflected, in part, a demographic trend that
bodes ill for the Nationalists and also for China's hope of
peaceful reunification: many younger people have no allegiance to
the Nationalist Party their parents long served, and think of China
as a distant concept.
</P>
<P>
   Since the first presidential election in 1996, more than 1
million young people became eligible to vote, Chu noted. And fully
half of them said in recent surveys that they were voting for Chen,
who is seen as representing youthful energy and cleaned-up
politics.
</P>
<P>
   China's military threats do not intimidate such people. A
typical example is Yang Jie-lung, a 27-year-old graphic designer.
Approached Saturday morning as he left the polling booth, he would
not discuss his preferences until his mother, a lifelong
Nationalist, was out of earshot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope Chen Shui-bian can win,'' he said. ``He's the best one
to clean up the problems left by the Nationalists, and as mayor he
did a pretty good job.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the mainland's dark warnings, he said: ``We are not
obliged to take any advice from China. We are electing our own
president.''

BEIJING SAYS IT WILL WAIT TO SEE HOW TAIWAN VICTOR ACTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Also see CHINA-TAIWAN-ARMS-REVIEW) 
 (bl)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ The surprisingly strong victory of Chen Shui-bian in
Taiwan's presidential election generated plenty of buzz in Beijing
on Saturday, but was greeted with an official cold shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Through much of the last month, China's top leaders have been
threatening trouble if Chen won the election (although they
carefully never referred to him by name), suggesting that if
Taiwan's voters chose pro-independence forces they might not get
the chance to choose again.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night those remarks clearly needed some clarification.
And in its few terse words the government seemed initially at least
to be setting off on a moderate course.
</P>
<P>
   ``The election of the leader of Taiwan and its outcome cannot
alter the fact that Taiwan is part of Chinese territory,'' said a
government statement that was read at the tail end of the 10 p.m.
news in a brief first report about Chen's victory. ``We will listen
to the words and observe the actions of Taiwan's new leader and
wait and see in which direction he takes cross-straits relations.''
</P>
<P>
   Some midlevel officials and researchers said that the government
was almost certainly at work revising its failed Taiwan policy and
would probably come out with a more explicit statement soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The result was really unexpected, and also the margin of
victory,'' said a researcher at a Communist Party research agency.
``But it puts them in a really tight spot because they worked so
hard to avoid this outcome.''
</P>
<P>
   The news took a while to sink in with the official news media.
Long after Chen had delivered his acceptance speech, the only
mention of the election was a brief sentence from the government
news agency, Xinhua, noting that Chen was ahead in the Taiwanese
provincial elections. China still considers Taiwan a renegade
province that will someday reunite with the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   But it was hard to keep a lid on since many urban Chinese
quickly learned of Saturday's stunning victory on the Internet and
watched Hong Kong television stations, which are now widely
available in up-market housing complexes.
</P>
<P>
   And in this group the news met with general nervousness but also
mixed reactions, with some expressing anger at the party as well as
anti-American sentiment, but most predicting that China should and
would take a wait and see attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the future very much depends on Chen's policies after
he is elected,'' said Zhang Yunling, director of Asia Pacific
Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Science. ``The only thing
the Chinese government can do now is wait and see what he will
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Chen's party is theoretically in favor of independence
for Taiwan, Chen himself has backed away from this position, saying
that he would declare independence only if invaded.
</P>
<P>
   Zhang said that if Chen ``made some compromises,'' the currently
tense situation could be improved. But he added: ``I think the
danger was never more than it is now. If his policies lead to a
more pro-independent stance, then the leaders are pushed into a
corner and will have to react.''
</P>
<P>
   Most people still doubt that there will be war, but some said
Chen's win would certainly strengthen the hard-liners who have
advocated stronger measures against Taiwan. Just before the last
Taiwanese elections, in 1996, the Chinese lobbed missiles toward
Taiwan as a warning.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``The leadership will be under pressure,'' said a propaganda
official. ``This time they held off from military exercises and
used words and threats. And now look what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   On Chinese Internet chat rooms throughout the day, students
suggested demonstrating at the U.S. Embassy if Chen won.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, in the hours after Chen declared victory, the
streets in the embassy district were quiet, but both the U.S.
Embassy office building and the ambassador's residence had more
than the normal guard force from the People's Armed Police, at the
request of the embassy.
</P>
<P>
   But Saturday there were practical as well as ideological
considerations that sway party decisions _ like China's drive to
enter the World Trade Organization _ and many suggested they would
put a damper on any reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although the leadership would have intellectually prepared for
this result, the reality will take time to swallow and it will make
for many complications,'' the researcher at a government research
agency said.

CLINTON CALLS FOR NEW RESERVE OF HEATING OIL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton on Saturday proposed the creation
of a new reserve of heating oil to cushion against future shortages
in the Northeastern states. But beyond exhorting foreign nations to
boost their oil production, he proposed no short-term steps to
relieve rising fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he urged Congress to focus on long-term efforts to
reduce fuel consumption, including conservation tax credits and
research spending, which Congress has rejected when he proposed
them before.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no overnight solution to this problem,'' Clinton said
in his weekly radio address.
</P>
<P>
   He did not propose any emergency steps, like releasing oil from
existing federal reserves, which are for emergency use, or lowering
gasoline taxes. And he ruled out increasing domestic production in
Alaska by drilling in protected wildlife habitats.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that while the spike in fuel prices this spring was
hard on people with modest incomes who must drive long distances to
work, and on independent truckers (who have protested by driving
their rigs through Washington), the overall economy remained
strong.
</P>
<P>
   Creating a new reserve pool of fuel for the Northeast, where
there were shortages this winter, could provide insurance against
disruptions in the long term, but in the short term would only dry
up an already tight market.
</P>
<P>
   Congress would have to approve any such measure, and the
president conceded that his other ideas have received short shrift
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``For over two years, Congress has refused to pass common-sense
tax credits I've proposed to promote fuel-saving cars of the future
and energy-efficient homes, buildings and equipment,'' he said,
urging Congress to reconsider.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's long past time for Congress to fully fund the more than
$1 billion I've requested to accelerate the research and
development of more efficient energy technologies,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The average price of gasoline, which was about $1.25 at
Christmas, has risen in recent weeks to above $1.50, and the Energy
Department now projects that it could reach as much as $1.80 this
summer. Even if oil-producing countries expand production, the
agency has predicted that prices will stay relatively high for
months to come.
</P>
<P>
   Crude oil and gasoline stocks in the United States are at
``alarmingly low'' levels not seen in decades, the agency said last
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the gasoline season gets under way, stocks will plumb
uncharted depths if they follow their usual seasonal pattern,'' the
agency predicted.

ROLE OF RUSSIAN OLIGARCHS UNDER PUTIN IS UNCERTAIN

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ When Boris Yeltsin was re-elected Russia's president in
1996, he owed his victory in large part to the so-called oligarchs,
a group of Russian multimillionaires _ bankers, oilmen and media
moguls _ who in turn owed their wealth and influence to Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   This closed and cozy circle worked very well for a few in Russia
until Dec. 31, when Yeltsin suddenly resigned, putting the Kremlin
in the hands of Vladimir Putin, the man poised to win Russia's
presidential election on March 26.
</P>
<P>
   Now observers are asking whether a Putin victory will be bogged
down by the same kind of debts to the same, or a similar, group of
oligarchs that compromised Yeltsin's final scandal-ridden years in
office.
</P>
<P>
   Having obtained their wealth by buying state assets on the
cheap, trading heavily on their Kremlin connections, most of
Russia's oligarchs survived the devastating financial crash of
August 1998 by a cynical manipulation of their remaining
properties.
</P>
<P>
   Some have since moved to legitimize their holdings, while others
have rushed to acquire new ones _ the recent dash to divvy up
Russia's aluminum industry is a case in point. But now, with a new
era beginning in the Kremlin, virtually all are looking over their
shoulders at Putin, an ex-KGB agent who is promising to put
Russia's affairs in order, and its criminals in jail.
</P>
<P>
   For Russian businessmen and foreign investors, Putin's treatment
of the oligarchs will be a litmus test of his promises to put the
Russian economy, and its vast natural wealth, under the rule of
law, with equal opportunities and conditions for all.
</P>
<P>
   For Russian voters, many of them poor and bitter, how Putin
handles such figures as Boris Berezovsky _ the most notorious of
oligarchs _ will be a sign of the new leader's relationship to the
Family, an almost mythical clique made up of rich businessmen,
Yeltsin relatives and Kremlin aides that has become the watchword
for Russia's crippling crony capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   On this issue, as on others, Putin has made reassuring
statements. ``It is necessary to prevent anyone from latching onto
power and being able to use it for their own purposes,'' he told
supporters late last month. He also put forward _ albeit in vague
terms _ an agenda of legislative reform, such as long-awaited
changes to the tax code that are hailed by business leaders as a
step toward more sensible regulation of Russia's unruly economy.
</P>
<P>
   But looking at deeds rather than words, Putin has yet to show
his hand. And that is a disappointment for those who expected him
to start by taking a tough line against the favorites of the
Yeltsin era.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, my own hopes that he would distance himself
from them are wrong,'' said Evgenia Albats, a well-known Russian
investigative reporter.
</P>
<P>
   According to Albats and others, the signs of Putin's continued
engagement with Yeltsin's inner circle are small, but telling.
Mostly they revolve around individuals _ such as Alexander
Voloshin, the Kremlin's chief of staff, or Valentin Yumashev, one
of his predecessors, both bona fide members of the Family and both
widely reported to have kept a hand in the Putin campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``He left the same gatekeepers in place, Yumashev and Voloshin,
and we know that they are closely connected to Berezovsky,'' Albats
said. There are also reports that Yeltsin's daughter, Tatyana
Dyachenko, who emerged publicly in 1996 as her father's campaign
adviser, has also been involved in the Putin campaign.
</P>
<P>
   When Putin took office on New Year's Eve, his first decree
granted immunity to Yeltsin, and provided material support _
housing, cars, medical benefits _ to members of the Yeltsin family.
Soon afterward, he dismissed Dyachenko from her official Kremlin
job, but reappointed Voloshin. He demoted the first deputy prime
minister, Nikolai Y. Aksyonenko, reputedly a Family favorite, but
kept him in government in his old job as railway minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hear rumors that he promised to keep Voloshin for a year,
and if he does, it means that the Family is still in full
control,'' said Igor Malashenko, president of NTV-Holding, part of
the media group controlled by Vladimir V. Gusinsky, another
oligarch who has been at war with the Kremlin _ and Berezovsky _
for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Malashenko and others say the appointment of Mikhail Kasyanov,
who as first deputy prime minister now heads Putin's government and
has been linked in the Russian press to members of Berezovsky's
clan, could also be a sign of Putin's dependence on that clique.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Putin appoints Kasyanov as the next prime minister,'' Lilia
Shevtsova, a senior analyst at the Carnegie Endowment for Peace,
said at a recent conference, ``it would be a very nasty, a very bad
sign. It would be a sign that Putin cannot be independent, that he
cannot brush aside the influence of several important and very
powerful groups that still continue to rule Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   The doings of Russia's oligarchs have long been a running soap
opera in the Russian press, where feuds and alliances are reported
on regularly, usually with scant detail and heavy interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   The recent fight over the aluminum industry has been widely
depicted as a clash between two clans _ one including Berezovsky
and his ally Roman Abramovich, and the other including Oleg
Deripaska, an aluminum magnate and ally of Anatoly Chubais, the
former Kremlin aide, head of Russia's electrical utility monopoly,
and an honorary oligarch.
</P>
<P>
   According to investment analysts, Berezovsky and Abramovich,
operating through 24 separate offshore companies, are believed to
have acquired 60 percent to 70 percent of the Russian aluminum
industry by buying up stakes in two major plants, Krasnoyark and
Bratsk.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has done nothing to stop the property deals, nor has he
shown favorites. Although both he and Chubais have connections that
date from their days together in St. Petersburg, Putin has been
distinctly cool to his old colleague, particularly in a recent
book-length interview released last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``So he tries to distance himself, he tries to find some point
above the oligarchic fray,'' Shevtsova said of Putin's silence.
``He cannot control, he probably knows this, and he takes it rather
calmly because he doesn't have enough power to stop it.''

</P>
<P>
   In many respects, the battles portrayed in the media are a
reflection of battles over the media, which some analysts see as
the area of Russian life in which the oligarchs wield the most
political influence.
</P>
<P>
   Because of his control over ORT, Russia's largest and most
watched television station, Berezovsky has often proved to be a
useful, even essential, ally for the Kremlin. That was most
apparent in last fall's parliamentary election campaign, when
several prime-time programs on ORT mercilessly, and successfully,
slashed the main opposition party headed by former Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov and the mayor of Moscow, Yuri Luzhkov.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential campaign has been spared such vicious attacks,
although NTV, the flagship station of Gusinsky's empire, has
maintained a critical view of Putin and, in particular, the war in
Chechnya. Putin, in return, has refused all interviews on NTV, and
with any other media in the Gusinsky empire.
</P>
<P>
   A recent announcement that ORT's broadcasting license will go on
the auction block in May, when it expires, has been seen as an
attempt to show Berezovsky his place. ``Berezovsky is a loose
cannon and ORT is a huge propaganda machine,'' Malashenko said. ``I
doubt very much he will accept being pushed out, but they are
keeping him hanging, which means until the end of May he should
behave loyally.''
</P>
<P>
   Some, like Shevtsova, feel the real test for Putin will be
whether he chooses to pursue investigations against Berezovsky and
others that were dropped a year ago when the Kremlin forced out
Russia's chief prosecutor, Yuri I. Skuratov, with a sex-and-video
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Others doubt that Putin would be ready, during his first months
in office, to take on such a powerful opponent, and the team that
engineered his meteoric rise. Both Berezovsky and Voloshin are
widely credited with the strategy that propelled Unity, a pro-Putin
party, to victory in the December parliamentary elections. It was
that result, many analysts believe, that convinced Yeltsin to
relinquish his office six months ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Pyotr Aven, a former finance minister and president of Alfa-Bank
who supports Putin, argues that relations between the oligarchs and
Kremlin officials have been inflated in the public mind, and that _
despite the habit of some Kremlin insiders of vacationing in Europe
with favored businessmen _ it is those in government ministries who
really bend to oligarchs' pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Aven feels that Putin himself is independent and will remain so.
For one thing, the Putin campaign is not as dependent on private
money as Yeltsin's was in 1996, when the president had to stage an
extravagant, come-from-behind victory over Gennady Zyuganov, the
Communist Party leader. This time there are no Putin advertisements
on TV, no T-shirts, no rock concerts.
</P>
<P>
   And Aven, for one, has not been asked to donate money this time,
as he was then. ``They don't need it,'' he noted wryly.

JAPAN ARRESTS 4 TERRORISTS AFTER LEBANON EXPELS THEM 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By HOWARD W. FRENCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ In a swift denouement after years in flight, four
members of the Japanese terrorist group known as the Red Army were
arrested here Saturday after they were expelled from Lebanon and
denied entry into Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest of the four, who have been pursued by Tokyo for two
decades, came after an intricate legal and diplomatic minuet by
Lebanon that seemed filled with subtle betrayals. Lebanon was eager
to relieve itself of an embarrassing burden, but wary of strong
Arab public opinion in support of the suspected terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Having served their time in Lebanese prisons for entering the
country illegally, the four were put on a Middle East Airline
flight Saturday to Jordan, which had reportedly granted them entry
visas. Upon their arrival in Amman, however, the four were
immediately handed over to Japanese diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were surprised by their arrival and they left to an unknown
destination after we refused to allow them to enter Jordan,'' said
the Jordanian minister of information, Saleh Qalab. ``We considered
them transit passengers.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, the unknown destination was a heavily guarded
tarmac at Narita airport outside Tokyo, where the four arrived
aboard an Aeroflot flight at 5:19 p.m. They were arrested aboard
the airplane and then driven under heavy police escort to two
detention centers in Tokyo for questioning.
</P>
<P>
   A fifth Red Army member, Kozo Okimoto, 52, was granted asylum in
Lebanon but remains at Roumyieh prison outside Beirut, where he
reportedly awaits a suitable place to resume private life.
Okimoto's asylum was officially granted for health reasons, related
to the torture he says he suffered in Israel during his 13-year
imprisonment there.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese authorities said Saturday night that they were
``disappointed'' about Okimoto's asylum in Lebanon, where he is
something of a popular hero for his role in the May 1972 grenade
and machine-gun attack on Lod Airport at Tel Aviv. The three-man
attack killed 26 people, including 16 Puerto Rican Roman Catholic
pilgrims.
</P>
<P>
   Okimoto, who converted to Islam last week, adopting the first
name Ahmed, had been serving a life sentence in Israel for the Lod
attack but was released in 1985 in a prisoner exchange with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest of the four other fugitives, who are wanted in
connection with aircraft hijackings, bombings, embassy takeovers
and other terrorist attacks that made the Red Army one of the most
feared subversive groups of the 1970s and '80s, was nonetheless a
major victory for Japan's patient, persistent diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   Successive Japanese governments have quietly but relentlessly
maintained the pressure on Lebanon and other Middle Eastern
countries to cooperate in their efforts to apprehend the suspects,
whose photos are still posted at every Japanese immigration point.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to Saturday's arrest, only a handful of the 40 or so
active members of the Red Army were in Japanese custody. Indeed,
the woman who founded the group in 1971, Fusako Shigenobu, remains
a fugitive.
</P>
<P>
   According to a State Department report on the group, Shigenobu,
who is 54, established the Red Army after breaking away from
another radical leftist group, the Japanese Communist League-Red
Army Faction. The group is believed to have trained its members in
the Syrian-controlled Bekaa region of Lebanon with support from a
radical Palestinian group, the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Army's stated goals were to overthrow the Japanese
government, eliminate the monarchy and foment world revolution. For
two decades, until it began to fade into obscurity, the Red Army is
believed to have worked in a loose network with other international
revolutionary groups, including the Baader-Meinhof Gang in Germany
and the Red Brigades in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   One of the four members returned to Japan Saturday is Haruwo
Wako, 50, who was in charge of the group's military operations and
reportedly planned the occupation of the American and Swedish
Embassies in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Another is Masao Adachi, 59, a former film director who joined
the group in 1974 and was its spokesman. Adachi married a Lebanese
woman in a highly publicized ceremony in Lebanon and converted to
the Greek Orthodox faith last month.
</P>
<P>
   The only woman in the group returned Saturday is Mariko
Yamamoto, 58, who was a publishing house employee before leaving
Japan in 1972. She reportedly joined the Red Army in Paris, where
she worked at a department store.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth returnee is Kazuo Tohira, 46, who had also served
prison time in Sweden in connection with his activities for the
group.

U.S. DEMANDS TO REVIEW MEDICARE MAILINGS BY HMOS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Pa., Calif.)   (jw) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Medicare officials have accused health maintenance
organizations of sending false information to their elderly
subscribers in an effort to mobilize them to pressure Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In response, federal officials have begun demanding that HMOs
submit newsletters and other documents to the government for review
before sending them to Medicare beneficiaries. In this way, the
government says, it will be able to ``correct any misstatements or
misleading information.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials said they could also impose civil fines and
other penalties on HMOs that send misinformation to beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   The health plans insist that they are only exercising their
right to communicate with their members on important public issues,
including recent cuts in Medicare benefits.
</P>
<P>
   But federal investigators say they have found evidence that HMOs
billed Medicare for some of their lobbying expenses. Federal
regulations generally prohibit government contractors from using
federal money for lobbying intended to influence Congress.
</P>
<P>
   HMOs say that some lobbying expenses may indeed have been
included with other administrative costs in the past. And they
insist that the practice was not forbidden by the Medicare law.
</P>
<P>
   A new study by the Health Care Financing Administration, which
runs Medicare, says HMOs have disseminated ``false and/or
misleading information'' that blames the agency for rising health
care costs, increased premiums and reductions in benefits.
</P>
<P>
   One HMO, run by Highmark Inc., a Blue Cross and Blue Shield plan
in Pennsylvania, told members that the Clinton administration was
cutting $11 billion from Medicare ``without approval from
Congress.'' It urged Medicare beneficiaries to send letters of
protest to Congress and the administration.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Dr. Robert A. Berenson, a senior Medicare
official in charge of the managed care program, said, ``We are very
concerned about health plans that have been misleading
beneficiaries and misrepresenting facts.''
</P>
<P>
   Berenson acknowledged that any restrictions on the free-speech
rights of HMOs could run afoul of the First Amendment. But in a
recent memorandum to the head of the Medicare agency, Berenson said
some restrictions were necessary because otherwise patients would
receive inaccurate information, and the agency would be ``unfairly
blamed for benefit cuts or premium increases.''
</P>
<P>
   Medicare officials considered issuing a regulation that would
flatly prohibit HMOs from using their members' names and addresses
for lobbying or political purposes.
</P>
<P>
   But, Berenson said, lawyers at the Department of Health and
Human Services have ``serious concerns about the statutory basis
for such a regulation,'' fearing that it could be challenged as
``an unconstitutional restriction on speech.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than ban such communications, federal officials said,
they will review them in advance to correct any inaccuracies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The threat of public criticism'' by the government will
probably be effective in getting HMOs to revise their
communications with beneficiaries, Berenson said in his memo. ``In
extreme situations,'' he said, the government can correct the
misinformation by writing directly to patients.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Berenson said that ``we would not engage in
prior restraint,'' but that HMOs would find it advisable to
cooperate with the government. ``You shouldn't hear a political
message in the midst of promotional material for the medical care
at a particular organization,'' Berenson said.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare provides health care to 39 million people who are
elderly or disabled. More than 6 million of them, about 16 percent
of all beneficiaries, are in HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   Karen M. Ignagni, president of the American Association of
Health Plans, the main lobby for the managed care industry, said,
``The Clinton administration is limiting our ability to communicate
with our members because it disagrees with our message.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, she said, federal officials have told some HMOs
that they cannot use their newsletters to inform Medicare
beneficiaries of a grass-roots coalition lobbying Congress for more
generous HMO payments and benefits. More than 80,000 elderly people
have joined the coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're merely imparting information to beneficiaries,'' Ignagni
said. ``They have a great deal at stake. They depend on us for
coverage of prescription drugs and other benefits not available in
the traditional Medicare program.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration and HMOs are theoretically partners
in the Medicare program, but their relations have deteriorated in
the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton contends that HMOs are overpaid by Medicare,
while the health plans contend they are paid too little to cover
the benefits they provide.
</P>
<P>
   Health plans have also clashed with Clinton over legislation
that would grant patients a wide range of new rights, including the
right to sue HMOs for injuries caused by negligent treatment or the
denial of care.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare payments to HMOs vary from county to county, and many
HMOs have pulled out of the Medicare program in counties where they
consider the payments inadequate. Many health plans that remain in
the program have cut benefits, including coverage of prescription
drugs, or increased the premiums and co-payments charged to
beneficiaries this year.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Weinstein, a spokesman for Highmark Inc., which operates
Keystone Health Plan West in Pennsylvania, said the company lost
$18 million on its Medicare HMO business in 1998 and lost $5
million to $10 million on the program in 1999. But, he said, the
company continues to operate the health plan for 145,000 Medicare
beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein defended the letters to beneficiaries in which
Highmark accused the Clinton administration of making ``arbitrary
cuts'' in Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a grass-roots communication with our members,''
Weinstein said. ``We felt it was important to do what we could to
preserve managed care as an option for the tens of thousands of
Medicare beneficiaries who want it.''
</P>
<P>
   Elderly people often join HMOs to obtain low-cost drug benefits,
and they lose such benefits if they return to the traditional
fee-for-service Medicare program. Insurance companies offer
supplemental insurance with drug benefits, but those Medigap
policies can be expensive, often costing more than $2,200 a year.
</P>
<P>
   June Gibbs Brown, inspector general of the Department of Health
and Human Services, said HMOs had billed Medicare for tens of
thousands of dollars in lobbying and political activities. Such
items were lumped together with other ``administrative costs''
reimbursed by Medicare, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Pete Stark, D-Calif., the ranking member of his party on
the Ways and Means Health Subcommittee, said: ``HMOs have been
lobbying Congress, spending millions of dollars against the
patients' bill of rights and seeking more money from Medicare. That
is their right.''
</P>
<P>
   But to pay for such activities, Stark said, ``HMOs should use
their profits, not the money that is supposed to go to
beneficiaries in medical care.''

TAIWAN'S VOTERS YEARN FOR FRESH STYLES AND IDEAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANCHI, Taiwan _ Lee Teng-hui has loomed large over Taiwan, and
nowhere more than in this hilly seaside village northwest of
Taipei: Lee, the island's first democratically elected president,
was born here in a sturdy red brick farmhouse that still draws
visitors every day.
</P>
<P>
   But Saturday, as Taiwan's voters went to the polls to elect a
successor to Lee, the president's birthplace was deserted. And in
town, where people lined up to cast their ballots, Lee's legendary
influence over Taiwanese politics was disappearing at the voting
booth as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though I admire Lee, it's important for me to vote for
someone who will change Taiwan's society,'' said Chiang Wen-ding,
53, a retired factory worker who voted for Chen Shui-bian, the
Democratic Progressive candidate, over the president's anointed
successor, Vice President Lien Chan.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Jian-long, a 22-year-old business management student who
voted for James Soong, the independent candidate, said: ``As a
young person, I'm not influenced at all by whom Lee Teng-hui says
to vote for. I voted for James Soong because he would be a new kind
of leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Chang Ai-huei, 31, an office worker, said she too voted for
Soong, because she yearns for fresh leadership after five decades
of rule by the Nationalist Party. ``Voting for Lien Chan is like
voting for Lee Teng-hui, and I think it is time for a change,''
said Chang, as she gestured impatiently toward the Nationalist
Party's campaign headquarters across the street.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with more than a dozen voters in Sanchi on Saturday
indicated strong support for both the eventual winner, Chen, and
the runner-up, Soong, who is a bitter rival of Lee. Remarkably,
even in the president's hometown, voters _ young and old, male and
female _ rebuffed Lee's repeated pleas to elect Lien and extend the
Nationalist Party's half-century reign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should I listen to Lee Teng-hui?'' asked Pan Yue-ching, a
38-year-old housewife. ``I have my own opinions.''
</P>
<P>
   Some longtime loyalists consoled themselves that although they
were rejecting Lee's party, they were not necessarily flouting his
deeper wishes. They seized on widespread rumors that Lee has frosty
relations with Lien and prefers Chen on a personal level.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lee is secretly supporting Chen, but as KMT chairman, he must
support Lien,'' said Chiang, the factory worker, using the initials
for Kuomintang, the Nationalist Party's Chinese name. Another Chen
supporter interjected, ``President Lee keeps shouting Lien Chan,
but when he holds up his hand, it says 5,'' a reference to Chen's
number on the presidential ballot.
</P>
<P>
   People who voted for Chen said they believed that he would shake
up Taiwan's political culture, which has been ossified by more than
50 years of single-party rule. They accused the Nationalist Party
of corrupting the electoral process by buying votes and through
other forms of bribery.
</P>
<P>
   Although some voters said that electing Chen could increase
tension between Taiwan and mainland China, they said it was not
enough to disqualify him. ``It's always the same between these two
countries,'' said Lee Fung-lin, 38, an unemployed restaurant
worker. ``They just shout at each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Chiang said he was not about to let Beijing dictate his choice.
``I've been living with the threat of mainland China for 50 years,
so I'm used to it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, on this day of defeat for Lee Teng-hui and his party, a
cousin, Lee Teng-wong, stopped on a bucolic road near the family
home to chat about the legacy of his famous relative. ``The
Taiwanese people will remember him for bringing them democracy,''
the cousin said.

<P>
   MOSCOW _ With Russia's presidential elections just a week away,
Acting President Vladimir Putin sought to reassure voters Saturday
that the war in Chechnya was drawing to a close and that some
Russian troops would soon be on their way home.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be no more organized resistance,'' Putin said.
``Large-scale military operations are coming to an end.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin's assurances were intended to pre-empt an emerging debate
about Russia's military campaign. And they have coincided with a
demand by Russia's Press Ministry that rebel leaders in the
separatist southern region of Chechnya be denied air time on
Russian television and radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   The Press Ministry insists that its ban is needed to fight
terrorism. But the political aim appears to be to minimize news
media coverage of rebel commanders, whose defiant comments are an
unpleasant reminder that a Russian victory is not yet at hand.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly most Russians still consider the military operation a
long-overdue effort to bring order to the breakaway republic.
Opinion polls also indicate that a majority of Russians still
consider the military campaign a success.
</P>
<P>
   As the March 26 election draws closer, however, Russians have
been jolted by some disturbing scenes, including the solemn funeral
in the western Russian town of Pskov for 84 paratroopers killed in
a single battle, and bitter fighting over the Chechen town of
Komsomolskoye, which passed from Russian to Chechen control and
then back again.
</P>
<P>
   It is also apparent that the Russian military has not met its
self-declared deadline to wrap up the fighting well before the
March elections. Even so, the official Russian casualty toll now
stands at 1,628 killed and 4,308 wounded since the start of the
military operation on Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   So Putin sought to paint a brighter picture Saturday, reassuring
voters on a state-owned radio station that Russia had broken the
back of the rebel resistance. Putin also said that surplus troops
would soon be brought home, although he was careful not to provide
any specifics.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's generals, for their part, did their best to buttress
Putin's confident message. Russian soldiers in Chechnya and other
remote regions began casting their presidential ballots on Friday.
Gen. Gennady N. Troshev, the deputy commander of Russian forces in
the North Caucasus, left no doubt whom he expected his troops to
support.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have the right to vote for whomever they want,'' Troshev
said. ``But I think the military has made its choice. We know who
the man is who today stands by and supports the military as we
complete our task.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, however, neither the task in Chechnya nor the debate
about it is over. Russian commanders have said that about 25,000
troops will be stationed indefinitely in Chechnya after the main
fighting is over to counter guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
   They include the Russian military's 42nd motorized division, a
brigade of Interior Ministry troops and a unit of border guards.
And even Russia's allies in Chechnya have cautioned that much
fighting lies ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Illusions that spring will arrive today or tomorrow should not
be nourished,'' said Akhmad-Khadzhi Abdul Kadyrov, the Chechen
mufti, who has supported Russia's military intervention.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Confronted with the prospect of a prolonged fight, Russian
authorities have pressed the news media to tone down the already
careful coverage of the war. The Press Ministry warned last week
that news organizations that broadcast interviews with rebel
leaders or quote them directly would violate Russian laws on
fighting terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   The main targets of the ban include Shamil Basayev, the Chechen
warlord; Aslan Maskhadov, the leader of the Chechen republic; and
Movladi Udugov, a spokesman for the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mass media have no right to give terrorists and people
suspected of terrorism an opportunity to advertise themselves,''
said Mikhail Lesin, the press minister.
</P>
<P>
   The warning was, in effect, a shot across the bow of news
organizations, and it is not yet clear how vigorously the Russian
government will enforce the ban.
</P>
<P>
   Ekho Moskvy, a Moscow radio station with a heavy news format,
managed to finesse the ban earlier this month by interviewing
Maskhadov but then having one of its broadcasters read the quotes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ministry's initial request was not to interview the
leaders of the Chechen military bands at all, but we refused,''
said Aleksei A. Venediktov, the editor in chief of Ekho Moskvy.
``We narrate their words, we just don't broadcast their voices.''

SOUTH AFRICA IN A FUROR OVER ADVICE ABOUT AIDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (lb) 
 By RACHEL L. SWARNS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ President Thabo Mbeki's decision to
seek advice from two Americans who argue that HIV does not cause
AIDS has touched off an outcry at home and abroad and raised fears
that South Africa's already soaring infection rate will climb still
further.
</P>
<P>
   News that Mbeki recently consulted the Americans, a scientist
and a professor of African history, leaked out this month and is
the latest of several disputes over how to treat AIDS in a country
of 44 million people with one of the highest HIV infection rates in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki and his officials spoke with David Rasnick, a biochemist,
and Charles Geshekter, a professor of African history at California
State University, Chico, as the president was considering
strategies to combat the virus, which has infected 12.9 percent of
the nation's adults.
</P>
<P>
   He plans to convene international AIDS experts later this year,
and he telephoned the scientists to assess various AIDS treatments
and to reappraise the evidence that concludes that HIV causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president speaks to all scientists and to everyone who
believes he's got something to contribute,'' said Parks Mankahlana,
the president's spokesman. ``Until all the questions that keep
cropping up are answered, we are not going to be able to say to a
person who disagrees with the conventional thinking, `You are wrong
or right.' Mbeki has never said HIV doesn't lead to AIDS,''
Mankahlana said.
</P>
<P>
   Rasnick argues that HIV does not cause AIDS, a view shared by
Peter Duesburg, a professor of biochemistry and molecular biology
at the University of California at Berkeley. The U.N. AIDS program,
the World Health Organization and most scientists say the causal
link between HIV and AIDS is already well established.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first we were thinking we would just ignore it, but now we
think this confusion can really undermine all the efforts people
have made to prevent this disease,'' Dr. Awa Coll-Seck, the
director of the United Nations' Department of Aids Policy in
Geneva, said in a telephone interview, referring to Mbeki's move.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will reassure themselves, perhaps, that they can
continue risky behavior because HIV is not the real cause of
AIDS,'' Coll-Seck said. ``It's becoming a real issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, government officials scrambled to explain
how $6.2 million of the country's $17 million AIDS budget went
unspent last year. They said the money would be rolled over into
next year's budget.
</P>
<P>
   And five months ago Mbeki stunned health experts by questioning
the safety of the standard anti-AIDS drug AZT. Last week, Health
Minister Manto Tshabalala-Msimang said the government had decided
the drug should not be distributed in public hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not enough information for me as the minister of
health to expose women to a drug that we do not know about,''
Tshabalala-Msimang said.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns about AZT, particularly for children, have been raised
in the United States. One study found that pregnant mice treated
with AZT gave birth to babies with tumors. But after reviewing the
mouse study and others like it, the National Institutes of Health
determined in 1997 that the benefits of the drug far outweighed the
potential side effects.
</P>
<P>
   One two-year study found that a short course of AZT treatment
for women who did not breast-feed their babies reduced transmission
of the virus by 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But Mankahlana says South Africa cannot afford to accept the
West's conventional wisdom about AIDS without investigating
carefully, since Western scientists have yet to discover a cure for
the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact of the matter is, there is so much that is still
unknown about HIV and AIDS,'' said Mankahlana, who added that the
government would spend an additional $11 million this year on
research.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Rasnick said he received a telephone call from Mbeki after he
replied to faxed questions from the president about AIDS. Rasnick
and his colleagues say AIDS is typically caused by recreational
drug use and malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
   Prominent scientists say this thesis, which is most prominently
advanced by Duesberg, relies mostly on the data of other scientists
and that those scientists disagree with this interpretation of
their work. But on Jan. 21, Mbeki called Rasnick directly, to hear
for himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted our views, and we gave them to him,'' said Rasnick
in a telephone interview from his home in Saratoga, Calif. ``He had
read everything we had written, everything that was available on
the Internet. He knows there are some serious questions out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's courageous,'' Rasnick said. ``You start looking
like a lunatic if you question the AIDS axioms. Knowing this in
advance, he put his neck out there anyway. He wants to have a free
and public hearing about all things related to AIDS.''

ON CHINA TRADE, GEPHARDT'S ON A TIGHTROPE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Mich., Calif., Ore., Va.)  (mk) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri, the House
Democratic leader and a hard-liner on foreign trade, is an unlikely
kingmaker for a decisive China trade deal that he fears could
jeopardize his greater goal of reclaiming the House this fall.
</P>
<P>
   He is walking a political tightrope as Congress debates whether
to grant China permanent normal trading privileges, a vital step
for its entry into the World Trade Organization. Congress now
conducts an annual review of China's trading status.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Gephardt's party is in the minority, House
Republican leaders say they need 80 to 100 Democratic votes to
ensure victory. Senate approval is considered likely. That is why
Gephardt, of all people, is trying to make the best of a trade pact
that, on his past record, he should be fighting.
</P>
<P>
   On virtually every contentious trade issue during the Clinton
administration, from the 1993 North American Free Trade Agreement
to fast-track consideration of other trade pacts, Gephardt has led
the opposing charge, calling for tougher labor, environmental and
human rights standards.
</P>
<P>
   But in the bruising battle over China trade, Gephardt has been
conspicuously, and deliberately, noncommittal, urging his
colleagues to vote their consciences. He has told business leaders
he will not rally Democrats against the pact.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt's allies say he is worried that his open opposition
could inflame an already divisive issue among House Democrats and
imperil the prize he covets so dearly: regaining control of the
House and becoming its speaker instead of minority leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dick has his eye on November, as he should,'' said Rep.
Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., who opposes permanent trade relations.
``He's got to make sure whatever he does he doesn't exacerbate the
split in the caucus over this.''
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt is also responding to changing dynamics within his
caucus and with the politics of money on Capitol Hill. Pushed by an
increasingly influential bloc of so-called New Democrats in the
House who are pro-trade and fiscally conservative, Gephardt is
courting American companies, especially high-tech concerns, with
the promise of a more business-friendly Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy is working. Soft-money contributions doubled in a
year, to $12 million last year, from corporate donors who
traditionally have funneled their campaign money to Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Openly opposing a China deal that corporate America warmly
embraces would undercut Gephardt's new fund-raising tack.
</P>
<P>
   So for now, at least, Rep. David E. Bonior of Michigan, the
Democratic whip, is leading the political fight against the accord,
while Gephardt assumes a behind-the-scenes role to keep his rank
and file united and to explore prospects for a party-healing deal.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference on Thursday, Gephardt again sidestepped the
question of how he would vote, and said he was trying to broker a
compromise with the administration, labor unions, business groups
and House Democrats who support the accord and those who oppose it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has to be a way to have an alternative to simply taking
away the process of looking at China's performance on human rights
in the Congress and leaving nothing in its place,'' Gephardt said.
</P>
<P>
   Such an alternative would include a ``methodical way'' to ensure
that China abides by its trade treaties, a mechanism to evaluate
its human rights record, and a code of conduct for American
companies doing business in China, he said. Under any compromise
legislation, Gephardt said, the United States should have the
option of imposing trade sanctions against China if it violated the
agreement, as long as the penalties were consistent with World
Trade Organization rules.
</P>
<P>
   But Gephardt conceded that hammering out conditions ``with
teeth'' at this stage might be unrealistic. ``I don't know if it
can be done,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic aides said another possibility was legislation that
could halt lending from the World Bank, the International Monetary
Fund and the U.S. Export-Import Bank should China flout
international norms.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of suggestions are being floated, none of which have
come to point of resolution,'' Commerce Secretary William Daley
said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Foes of permanent trade status for China say that Gephardt's
strategic silence does not mean he is any less committed to their
cause, and they insist that his coyness has not hurt their
campaign. ``It's going great for us, and our numbers are growing,''
said Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Bonior, working closely with labor unions, environmental groups
and human rights organizations, asserts that two-thirds of the 211
House Democrats will vote against giving up Congress' annual review
of China's trading status. ``The leader shares my views,'' Bonior
said of Gephardt.
</P>
<P>
   But other foes of permanent trade relations, while voicing
sympathy with Gephardt's political plight, say they will need his
influence come crunch time in late May or so when the
administration wants Congress to vote on the accord. ``I expect
that when the chips are down, Dick Gephardt will be with us because
that's what's in his heart,'' said George Becker, president of the
United Steel Workers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Rep. Peter A. DeFazio, D-Ore., said: ``He's been given a nearly
impossible problem by a president who doesn't care. When we get
down to the last few critical votes, and the White House is
offering bridges and defense contracts, that's when we're going to
need Dick to weigh in.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of permanent trading status applaud Gephardt's
statesmanship, and they say that by playing peacemaker rather than
spear-carrier, Gephardt has buoyed their chances of winning. ``He
has been very balanced in his presentation,'' said Mickey Kantor,
Clinton's former chief trade official and commerce secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. James P. Moran, D-Va., who favors permanent trade status
for China, predicted that Gephardt's bridge-building with the White
House would succeed, and ``it'll bring another 20 to 30 Democratic
votes on board.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican supporters of permanent trading status are more
suspicions about Gephardt's motives. When the administration
earlier last week released the previously classified details of the
agreement the United States negotiated with China last fall, House
Speaker Dennis Hastert chided Gephardt and Vice President Al Gore
for their relative silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, the release of the text of this agreement will
prompt the vice president and minority leader to finally let the
American people know where they stand on this issue,'' Hastert
said.
</P>
<P>
   That may not happen until the final floor vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't twist arms on most bills, and certainly on trade
bills,'' Gephardt said. ``Every member has their own set of views,
their own situation with their own district, and they're going to
make up their mind on what they think is the right thing to do, and
that's the way it ought to be.''

USING SIGNALS AND CUES TO PROJECT BUSH'S IMAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ At the celebration here after Gov. George W.
Bush all but clinched the Republican presidential nomination
Tuesday night, the person chosen to introduce him was not some
longtime Republican bigwig or starry political celebrity. It was
Mayor Carlos Ramirez of El Paso, a man outside the traditional
party mold.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, Ramirez is Latino. For another, he is a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   He took the stage after a reel of video highlights from Bush's
campaign that included a close-up of a cleric, presumably Roman
Catholic, who was smiling and laughing, presumably in adoration of
Bush. And Ramirez praised the Texas governor in a mixture of
English and Spanish, saying that Bush was a politician for
everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gracias a mi amigo,'' Bush told hundreds of supporters, who
happened to be gathered in a Jewish community center.
</P>
<P>
   It was a confluence of details and circumstances clearly meant
to portray Bush as a candidate eager to embrace diversity and
intent on broadening the Republican Party's appeal.
</P>
<P>
   And it was the definitive illustration of the extent to which
the Bush campaign stakes its ground, sculpts its appeal and manages
its image in the realm of verbal gestures and visual cues, subtle
signals and obvious signs.
</P>
<P>
   All last summer and fall, when Bush was cultivating a reputation
as a new-style Republican with a greater sensitivity and broader
reach than his political peers, the effort was largely grounded in
the places he went and the tableaus he assembled.
</P>
<P>
   He made more campaign stops in neighborhoods inhabited by
Latinos, blacks and Asians than perhaps any leading Republican
presidential candidate before him, and his campaign staff
demonstrated a knack for making sure the television footage and
magazine and newspaper photographs from these events showed Bush's
visage flanked by faces of different colors.
</P>
<P>
   It was a motif so prevalent that Vice President Al Gore's
advisers and allies fumed about it privately.
</P>
<P>
   When Bush sought to secure a victory in the South Carolina
primary by reaching out to religious conservatives there, he did
not suddenly take new positions, as news accounts of a rightward
tilt to his candidacy suggested.
</P>
<P>
   But he did speak in a different language and drape himself in
different surroundings, like Bob Jones University, a bastion of
Christian conservatism with a history of racial discrimination and
anti-Catholic views.
</P>
<P>
   And when Bush subsequently labored to ditch that political
baggage, Catholic priests began popping up near him in various
places: at an airport rally in Kansas City; on the dais with him at
a luncheon in Springfield, Ill.; in the footage shown at his
victory party here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In the days leading to the primary in New York, the Bush
campaign managed to find an upstate city _ Binghamton _ that staged
a St. Patrick's Day parade two weeks before the holiday. Bush
participated in it.
</P>
<P>
   Early this week, when he visited a strawberry festival in Plant
City, Fla., Bush stopped for a snack at a booth that happened to be
set up by St. Clement Catholic Church, and the word Catholic was
prominent on a banner in the backdrop of news photographs capturing
the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've taken the Reagan model of symbolism to the 21st
century, down to every detail on every day at every event,'' said
Scott Reed, who ran Bob Dole's 1996 presidential campaign,
referring to Bush and his aides. ``They've taken it to the next
level.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's aides said that such symbolism simply complements
substantive proposals that the governor has made to reach out to
many people whom the Republican party has sometimes overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   One of Bush's boldest education ideas, for example, aims to
improve the kinds of troubled urban schools in which minority
students are disproportionately represented.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's mission to encourage religious organizations to
do more social work counts on the participation of Catholic and
Jewish leaders and African-American churches, and many of his
visits to the inner city are to promote and explain this plan.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, several political analysts said that Bush can surround
himself with so many visual reminders of racial and religious
diversity and not seem overly manipulative because these scenes
underscore actual alliances he has made.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's able to do it because he was forced, through two terms in
Texas, to forge relationships with Latinos and African-Americans,''
said David Doak, a Democratic strategist.
</P>
<P>
   But the company that Bush has kept and the language that he has
used on the campaign trail have not always been consistent,
suggesting that there are also strategic considerations at play.
</P>
<P>
   Before his battle with Sen. John McCain in South Carolina, his
answers to repeated questions about issues concerning gays were
worded in a relatively soft, conciliatory vein.
</P>
<P>
   But in South Carolina, Bush's diction was occasionally
different, as in his response when an interviewer for a Christian
radio station asked him how he felt about the possibility of
appointing someone who was forthcoming about his or her
homosexuality to a job in a presidential administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``An openly known homosexual,'' he said, ``is somebody who
probably wouldn't share my philosophy.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, of course, there was his appearance at Bob Jones
University, the public memory of which he sought to banish when the
Republican contest moved to states like New York and California,
where he needed to appeal to moderates.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole, who had not stumped with Bush in about a month,
suddenly reappeared on the campaign trail to attend that event, to
introduce the governor at several subsequent campaign stops in New
York and to extol his appeal to women.
</P>
<P>
   In California, Bush delivered a speech about the need for
acceptance and open-mindedness at the Simon Wiesenthal Center and
Museum of Tolerance in Los Angeles.

NEWS ANALYSIS: FLORIDA CASE CASTS DOUBT ON FUTURE OF SCHOOL
VOUCHERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Fla., Wis., Ohio, N.Y.)  (jw) 
 By JODI WILGOREN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When a Florida judge declared last week that giving students
taxpayer-financed vouchers for private-school tuition violated that
state's constitution, he bulldozed an important national testing
ground for school choice and posted a reminder that the legal
landscape for vouchers included several potential pitfalls.
</P>
<P>
   For years, advocates of vouchers have watched enthusiastically
as the U.S. Supreme Court chipped away at the wall separating
church and state. The Florida ruling suggests, however, that even
if the Supreme Court upholds vouchers under the First Amendment _
as is expected _ vouchers could still be blocked by state
constitutional promises of a free public education.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strongest policy objection to vouchers is that it would
undermine the system of public education,'' said Laurence H. Tribe,
a constitutional scholar at Harvard University. ``What's
interesting about the Florida decision is it identifies a state
constitutional problem in that policy objection.''
</P>
<P>
   The Florida ruling, which is being appealed, sets no precedent
for judges elsewhere but it might dim enthusiasm for voucher bills
pending in more than 20 state legislatures, as politicians already
wary of the heat surrounding the issue worry about passing programs
only to have them killed by the courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the political fallout on either side of this issue,''
said Eric Hirsch, an education analyst at the National Conference
of State Legislatures, ``to go through this and not be sure it can
be implemented is going to be a difficult decision for
legislators.''
</P>
<P>
   As vouchers gain in popularity, backed by a growing coalition of
poor inner-city parents and conservative philanthropists who share
a concern about failing public schools, their legal prospects are
unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's ruling by Judge L. Ralph Smith of the Circuit Court
in Tallahassee, was the seventh in a string of victories for
opponents of vouchers in court cases around the country. ``We're on
a roll,'' exulted Robert Chanin, a lawyer who has led the legal
challenges.
</P>
<P>
   But advocates of vouchers have kept a different tally, pointing
to five Supreme Court cases over the past two decades that
suggested a 5-4 majority supporting some use of public money in
parochial schools. They also noted that a Wisconsin ruling similar
to Smith's was overturned by that state's Supreme Court, leaving a
mixed record on even the narrow state issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way on earth that I would trade places with the
other side as far as jurisprudence is concerned,'' said Clint
Bolick, litigation director of the Institute for Justice in
Washington, which has helped defend most of the court cases.
``Everybody understands that the court that matters most is the
United States Supreme Court.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith's ruling turned on a provision of the Florida Constitution
guaranteeing a ``uniform, efficient, safe, secure and high-quality
system of free public schools.'' Virtually every state added a
similar promise of public education to its constitution during the
Progressive Era early in the 20th century, but the language varied
widely, as has the litigation history in each state.
</P>
<P>
   That is why the fate of vouchers is more likely to be decided by
federal church-state questions, largely the interpretation of the
First Amendment's assertion that ``Congress shall make no law
respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free
exercise thereof.''
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court has declined three times to review voucher
cases in recent years, but is widely expected to accept either the
Florida case _ should Smith be overruled by the state Supreme Court
_ or an Ohio case in which a federal judge declared in December
that Cleveland's voucher program illegally mixed government and
religion.

   Opponents of vouchers are relying on a 1973 case in which the
Supreme Court rejected a voucher program in New York State. But
advocates of vouchers contend that attitudes have shifted, pointing
to decisions that have allowed tax deductions for parochial school
tuition; public payment for an interpreter for a deaf student
attending a Roman Catholic school; and the use of state-paid
remedial tutors in religious school classrooms. A crucial test is a
New Orleans case pending this term on whether the government can
pay for computers and Internet connections at private as well as
public schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are basically two images that are vying for control: one
is the image of strict separation, the wall, the other is the idea
of equality,'' said Akhil Amar, a professor at Yale Law School.
</P>
<P>
   ``The separation idea says no government money can ever go to
religion in any way. The equality idea says government shouldn't be
giving money to religion as such, but if government is giving money
to everyone, the religions should get money on equal terms.''
</P>
<P>
   It may come down to determining the difference between a fire
extinguisher and a computer.
</P>
<P>
   Few would argue that churches and synagogues are not as entitled
to fire and police protection as their secular neighbors. If the
government decided to distribute free fire extinguishers, surely it
should not skip over mosques and monasteries.
</P>
<P>
   But what if the state handed every child a computer to be used
at school? Could parochial-school students use their laptops for
religious instruction, or even prayer? If so, why not make the
whole cost of education transportable, from public school to
private, perhaps even to individual homes where parents handle
schooling themselves?
</P>
<P>
   ``We are moving toward the equality model,'' said Amar, one of
several liberal scholars who said they were skeptical of the
effectiveness of vouchers, but believed they passed constitutional
muster. ``Taken to its extreme, separation requires the
discrimination against religion.''
</P>
<P>
   Bolick and other supporters of vouchers see their programs as
comparable to the G.I. Bill, giving each family a check that can be
cashed at an array of schools _ public, private and parochial. But
there are two major differences: the vast majority of schools that
accept vouchers so far are religious, and the program is much
larger in scope.
</P>
<P>
   ``While it is true that the court in recent years has been
prepared to uphold some programs that channel some government money
into parochial schools, none of those programs have involved the
transfer of this massive amount of money,'' said Steven R. Shapiro,
national litigation director for the American Civil Liberties
Union, which has fought vouchers in court. ``There's a point at
which a difference in quantity becomes a difference in kind.''

IN LATEST PROVIDENCE JOLT, EX-TAX OFFICIAL CONVICTED 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By CAREY GOLDBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVIDENCE, R.I. _ Renaissance, shmenaissance, some things in
Providence remain very much the same, it seems.
</P>
<P>
   In this reviving old city _ the real one, not the NBC prime-time
television version _ the central public drama playing lately
centers on a nest of graft-grabbing functionaries.
</P>
<P>
   It began more than two years ago when a world-class
whistle-blower agreed to secretly record his dealings with corrupt
tax officials, a sting federal authorities called ``Operation
Plunder Dome.''
</P>
<P>
   And it reached a denouement of sorts on Friday: A jury found the
city's former deputy tax assessor, Rosemary Glancy, guilty of
conspiracy, attempted extortion and mail fraud. Glancy, a city
employee for 26 of her 47 years, maintained her innocence and wept
in court.
</P>
<P>
   But that verdict does not end the drama's suspense. The real
talk of Providence, many people say, is whether federal
investigators will ultimately bring down Vincent A. Cianci Jr., the
city's beloved, marinara-sauce-making, convicted felon of a mayor,
who is a driving force behind its current much-trumpeted
renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   Cianci denies all wrongdoing, saying he accepts responsibility
for the City Hall corruption, but only because ``the buck stops at
my desk,'' not because of any criminal liability. In a telephone
interview, he also denied that the Plunder Dome affair reflected
much about Providence. ``There are many cities in America that have
the same thing going on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But few cities have quite so extensive a rap sheet of
corruption, with scandals or actual convictions reaching from the
bottom to the very top echelons of city and state power _ from the
16 city workers and contractors jailed on charges including
conspiracy and fraud in a previous Cianci administration to the
conviction of former Gov. Edward D. DiPrete in late 1998 on 18
charges of corruption to resignations under the threat of
impeachment by supreme court justices.
</P>
<P>
   Rhode Island has put into effect some significant
anti-corruption provisions in recent years, but culture changes
slowly. So few in Providence have been surprised at the Plunder
Dome revelations, including one defendant's bald assertion,
captured on tape, that ``To do business in the city of Providence,
one must pay money to the appropriate official or authority.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Rather, many sound like Steve Gordon, a 58-year-old teacher, who
said that as an honest taxpayer, he found it annoying that some
people paid bribes instead of taxes, but that it was nothing new in
Providence: ``As Yogi Berra said, it's deja vu all over again,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Some specifics in the Plunder Dome case are certainly new, from
one defendant's instructions to refer to bribe money as ``pizza''
or ``things,'' to the Broadway-style closing argument in Glancy's
trial by Assistant U.S. Attorney Richard Rose, in which he went
from roars to whispers and repeated, again and again, ``Innocent
dupe? Or corrupt public official?''
</P>
<P>
   The tapes have also offered some classic lines, like a
defendant's statement that he passed on bribes to other officials:
``I throw them money,'' he said. ``Then they cut the bull. I throw
them money, and they're happy. He's happy. Everybody's happy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Operation Plunder Dome'' came to light last spring, when FBI
agents descended upon City Hall to seize documents and arrested two
members of the Board of Tax Assessment Review.
</P>
<P>
   But the inquiry began more than a year earlier, when Antonio R.
Freitas, a businessman, began secretly video- and audio-taping his
bribery of city officials in exchange for favors like lowering his
property taxes.
</P>
<P>
   From April 1998 to April 1999, he recorded more than 100
conversations, federal authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The tapes implicated Joseph Pannone, the 77-year-old former
chairman of the tax board, and David Ead, the vice chairman, in
deals in which they secured tax abatements worth many thousands of
dollars in exchange for bribes of much less. One bribe was $2,400,
for example; others reportedly ranged from $10,000 to $200.
</P>
<P>
   Four other people have also been charged, but all except Glancy
pleaded guilty. Glancy was only a minor target of the FBI inquiry,
but her trial turned into a forum at which the public could get a
peek at the Plunder Dome doings. They could hear snippets of tape
like the one in which Pannone said of Glancy, ``She bends, you know
what I mean?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I show some green, and she's all right, she's happy,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Pannone also claimed on tape that he had received tutelage on
bribery from Cianci, whose nickname is Buddy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buddy told me to never talk on the phone, never get a check,
take cash one on one,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Cianci has told reporters that he had no involvement with
Pannone.
</P>
<P>
   After the verdict on Friday, Margaret Curran, the local
U.S.attorney, told The Providence Journal that federal authorities
would push on with their inquiry into City Hall corruption, adding,
``This is one small part of a larger investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   The question remains of how far, or rather, how high, the
investigation will reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the problems with this kind of corruption is that it's
sometimes hard to tell how far it leads,'' said H. Philip West Jr.,
executive director of Common Cause in Rhode Island. ``Is it only an
isolated pocket in an office where people keep the secret among
themselves, or does it extend upward in the administration? This is
a real tough one to analyze, but it increasingly appears that this
will reach upward.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In general, West said, Rhode Island has cleaned up its act
somewhat since the 1980s, overhauling its campaign finance laws,
its ethics rules and its judicial procedures, as well as
introducing term limits for statewide officials.
</P>
<P>
   But West is concerned, he said, by the ``enormous war chest'' of
campaign money Cianci has built up, and he is disturbed, he said,
that Cianci's approval ratings remain very high in polls: ``It's as
if we don't care what he does as long as we keep getting this
national shining city reputation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in some ways, Providence voters have already shown
exactly that.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, Cianci was forced to leave office after he was
convicted on felony charges stemming from his assault using a lit
cigarette, ashtray and fireplace log on a contractor he accused of
having an affair with his estranged wife. But in 1990, he was
elected again, and he is now, with a total of more than 18 years in
office, the city's longest-serving mayor ever. He remains extremely
popular.
</P>
<P>
   Under his leadership, the city has moved rivers to create lovely
canals and lagoons, built a gigantic shopping mall and a new
convention center, and generally become a national model for how to
make a run-down old city hot again. It now boasts gondolas and a
new skating rink, among much more, and is increasingly attracting
high-tech companies that flee the steep prices of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   In a phone interview about the Plunder Dome investigation,
Cianci said, ``I'm sure that's a lot of drama, and it's the saga of
the city, ``but I can assure you _ I'm sure that my name has been
used, but I can assure you I had no involvement in any of that
stuff. And we continue on, we're just moving along, we're building
four brand new schools in the city and we'll be building new
hotels.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The city is also moving along somewhat in trying more
energetically to prevent such corruption. Cianci has been pushing
for a city ethics watchdog, and John J. Lombardi, the president of
the city's council, is calling for an ``ethics and integrity''
unit.
</P>
<P>
   The team should not only investigate but work to educate people,
Lombardi said. ``So, for example, person X walks into a department
and says, `May I have a copy of this? Oh, thank you, here's a
dollar bill, go buy coffee.' How do you handle something like that?
A lot of people don't know. They may not think it's anything.''

ALASKA AIRLINE REPAIR CENTER IS IN TURMOIL
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Wash., Alaska, Calif.)   (jw) 
 By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ After 64 mechanics at Alaska Airlines signed a letter
saying they had been ``pressured, threatened and intimidated'' to
cut corners on repairs and maintenance, the airline put one of its
managers on administrative leave and said Saturday that it was
conducting detailed interviews with all of the mechanics.
</P>
<P>
   The turmoil at the maintenance center here comes amid a
continuing federal investigation into the Jan. 31 crash of one of
the airline's MD-83 jetliners in the Pacific Ocean off the
California coast. All 88 people aboard were killed. The airline
also faces a separate federal grand jury investigation into charges
that supervisors at a separate Alaska maintenance center in
Oakland, Calif., had signed papers for repairs that either were not
done or that they were not authorized to approve.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued Friday, Alaska said that it was
cooperating fully with all federal inquiries into its practices and
that it would talk extensively with its mechanics to study charges
of improprieties in the maintenance hangar here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alaska will take whatever steps are dictated by these
interviews, including immediately grounding any aircraft involved,
in order that we may all have assurances of safety,'' said John
Fowler, the air carrier's executive vice president of technical
operations and system control.
</P>
<P>
   But, the statement said, in its interviews of the mechanics so
far, ``while all acknowledged signing the letter, none were able to
cite specific incidents in which they were aware of an aircraft
being returned to service in an unairworthy or unsafe condition.''
</P>
<P>
   The mechanics' letter to airline executives, delivered earlier
this week and described by The Seattle Times on Saturday, did not
cite any specific instances of inadequate repairs.
</P>
<P>
   But, the mechanics wrote, ``Our consciences constrain us to make
you both aware of an ongoing situation on the heavy check which we
have heretofore brought before management in the hangar, but our
pleadings have gone unheeded.'' A heavy check involves repairs to a
major flight-control part.
</P>
<P>
   The mechanics' complaints centered on Robert Falla, manager of
the Seattle maintenance base, the official now placed on temporary
leave. ``Amazingly,'' the letter said, ``in the midst of our grief
and shock subsequent to the crash of Flight 261, many amongst us
have been pressured, threatened and intimidated by Mr. Falla in the
daily performance of our work.''
</P>
<P>
   When Falla drove into his home on Friday morning and was asked
by The Seattle Times about the letter, he said, ``No aircraft under
my authority has ever gone out unairworthy or unsafe.'' And, he
added, ``There is nothing I have to hide, and there is nothing
Alaska Airlines has to hide.''
</P>
<P>
   The airline said it had delivered a copy of the letter to
federal investigators.

DEFENSE IN BOMBING CASE WARNS AGAINST EXECUTIONS ON WIDE POLITICAL
GROUNDS
</HEADLINE>
   (Exclusive) 
(rk) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Lawyers for three men charged in the 1998 African
embassy bombings are arguing for their clients' lives on political
grounds, contending that executing them would be a foreign-policy
disaster for the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In a memorandum that is being sent to Attorney General Janet
Reno, the defense lawyers contend that executions of their clients,
whom they describe as mere ``foot soldiers'' in a terrorist
conspiracy, would only turn them into Islamic martyrs while
creating a blood feud between the United States and the Muslim
world.
</P>
<P>
   The effect, the lawyers say, would be to seriously damage the
government's chances of prosecuting Osama bin Laden, the wealthy
Saudi exile who has been accused of leading a global terrorist
conspiracy that included the embassy attacks and other acts of
violence against Americans abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently worried that the issue may be viewed too narrowly,
the lawyers have also taken the unusual step of circulating their
30-page document to top officials in the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it plain,'' the Feb. 7 memo declares, ``that the
State Department ought to be fully consulted, and its views
considered, on all of the grave foreign policy, national security
and human rights implications of a U.S. government request for the
death penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   All three men have pleaded not guilty and plan to fight the
charges in court later this year. But the memorandum assumes for
the sake of argument that they have been convicted and that the
death penalty would be inappropriate. Such pleas are routine in
federal court.
</P>
<P>
   But lawyers in the case, U.S. vs. bin Laden, are seeking a much
broader audience in the government for their fears for their
clients' fates.
</P>
<P>
   The case is the first in which federal prosecutors have sought
to impose the death penalty against a defendant accused of
terrorism in a foreign country. It is also the first time the
government has begun to pursue the death penalty in the series of
major terrorism prosecutions of about two dozen Islamic militants
in New York that began with the 1993 World Trade Center bombing.
Among those cases is another plot to blow up major landmarks in New
York City.
</P>
<P>
   One defense lawyer who has read the memo said: ``This case lies
at the intersection of the criminal justice system and foreign
policy. The whole point of the memo is that it is folly to simply
treat this as a mere criminal case, much as we might wish things
were so simple.''
</P>
<P>
   The defense decided last week to send the memo after the U.S.
attorney, Mary Jo White, indicated that she would seek the death
penalty for at least one of the defendants, Mohamed Rashed Daoud
al-'Owhali, for his role in the attacks on embassies in Nairobi,
Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, which killed more than 200
people and wounded thousands. The decision must be approved by
Reno.
</P>
<P>
   A copy of the memo, which was written in the names of the nine
lawyers who are representing the three defendants who could face
capital punishment, was provided to The New York Times by a person
who has read it and believes that the death penalty issue should be
debated in a broader forum.
</P>
<P>
   The memo makes the defense strategy clear: to catch the
attention of top national security advisers to President Clinton
and to cast the death penalty issue not in legal terms but in a
larger context of the government's stand against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   The memo notes, for example, that if prosecutors seek to execute
al-'Owhali and his two co-defendants, Mohammed Saddiq Odeh and
Khalfan Khamis Mohamed, it would be the clearest signal that bin
Laden would also face execution were he ever brought to New York,
tried, and convicted.
</P>
<P>
   The government could hardly spare the leader of the conspiracy
if it planned to execute his lower level ``foot soldiers,'' the
memo asserts.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden remains at large, living in Afghanistan under the
protection of the fundamentalist Taliban, and the United States has
conducted sensitive negotiations with other Muslim countries in
hopes of having him arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, if the world knew bin Laden could receive a ``lethal
injection'' in a federal prison if he were turned over to the
United States, that would certainly chill any chance of cooperation
from Muslim countries, ``who must respond to domestic public
sentiment against handing over a Muslim leader to a Western
power,'' the memo says. But if bin Laden is not captured or is
spared execution as part of a deal for his extradition, it would be
all the more unfair to execute his lower-level operatives, the memo
says.
</P>
<P>
   Already, three other defendants in the case face charges that do
not carry the death penalty, even though they are charged with
playing more important roles in the organization that conspired to
carry out the bombings. The U.S. government said it would not seek
the death penalty against one of them to win his extradition from
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   If higher-ups are convicted, the memo says, they will be immune
from capital punishment. Likewise, it says, if al-'Owhali and his
two co-defendants are sent to prison for life, they too ``will
vanish from view and soon be forgotten. But a sentence of death
will rescue them from oblivion,'' the memo says, ``and transform
them into celebrated martyrs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The very fact that the United States will have designated
these defendants for execution,'' it goes on, ``will guarantee that
their pictures will be held aloft over crowds of protesters. Babies
will be named for them, and young men from Morocco to Pakistan will
make plans to emulate them. Their actual executions will ignite
outrage and protest in many Muslim countries, and will leave a
legacy of further violence and revenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Placing bin Laden on death row would have enormous ramifications
for the United States, the memo says. In the World Trade Center
case, it notes, the defendants did not face capital charges because
their crime occurred before the 1994 death penalty law was passed.
An attempt to arrest bin Laden and imprison him for life, the memo
contends, will be seen as a credible punishment, ``because it
displays the self-restraint and moderation of a great nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if the United States declares that its success in this
effort will be measured by its ability to kill bin Laden once he
has been taken prisoner and rendered harmless,'' the memo says,
``the story line will quickly shift in a direction that could do
considerable harm to long-term American interests.''
</P>
<P>
   The defense lawyers have made separate submissions tailored to
each man's personal circumstances, offering arguments of why the
death penalty is not appropriate. Those documents are not being
circulated outside the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   But the lawyers argue in their policy memo that the death
penalty decision is too big to be left solely to Reno. The memo
asks her, in making the ``momentous decision,'' to involve ``those
agencies which do possess genuine expertise and experience in how
the actions of U.S. courts may affect American policy interests
around the world.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In their memo, the lawyers argue that retribution would not
justify the death penalty. They say they went to Kenya and
interviewed the blast's survivors, ``but we met no one who wanted
to see them executed,'' the lawyers say.
</P>
<P>
   They also argue that deterrence is also not a valid
consideration for these defendants. They note that the government
has accused al-'Owhali, for example, with being a would-be suicide
bomber.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indeed, given the centrality of the concept of martyrdom in
extremist Islamic political movements,'' the memo says, ``a
stronger case could be made for the counterdeterrent effect of the
death penalty _ that is, that the death penalty would actually
stimulate rather than deter similar crimes in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``The death penalty is simply not what they fear,'' the memo
adds.
</P>
<P>
   Because court-ordered executions can take years to carry out,
the memo likens Reno's decision to ``a cruise missile with a six-,
eight- or ten-year trajectory.'' By that time, the political
terrain may be totally different, the memo says, and ``it may be
self-evident that executing three Islamist prisoners under the
glare of world attention is exactly the wrong thing for the United
States to do.''
</P>
<P>
   In perhaps its most chilling section, the memo describes bin
Laden's being convicted in the United States and sentenced to die.
The memo says he would likely present a ``dignified and charismatic
figure'' in the courtroom, and ``his denials of legal
responsibility for the Africa bombings will be credited by millions
throughout the world, to whom he will appear as a martyr for
Islam.''

GORE FAMILY'S TIES TO OIL MAGNATE REAP REWARDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DOUGLAS FRANTZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARTHAGE, Tenn. _ On the third page of Vice President Al Gore's
most recent financial disclosure report, after routine listings for
his salary and the value of his house in Washington and his small
farm here, is an unlikely entry _ $20,000 for leasing land for zinc
mining.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the yearly lease payment, which has earned Gore about
$450,000 since 1974, is the story of a sweetheart land deal from
long ago, and the ties between the vice president and his family
and Armand Hammer and his oil company, Occidental Petroleum.
</P>
<P>
   While the origins of that relationship lie in these rolling
hills of middle Tennessee and date back half a century, it has
continued to bring both benefits and scrutiny for Gore as he has
moved through Congress to the White House and finally toward his
party's presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Occidental gave $50,000 to the Democratic Party
for the 1996 campaign after a telephone solicitation by Gore from
his White House office and another $100,000 after its chief
executive, Ray Irani, spent two nights in the Lincoln Bedroom in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Occidental stock in the estate of Gore's father
has made the vice president a target for environmental groups. They
have demonstrated at about 30 Gore rallies, opposing the oil
company's plans to drill on land in Colombia that Indians contend
is theirs.
</P>
<P>
   The broad outlines of the Gore-Hammer-Occidental connection have
been reported at various points in the vice president's career,
with bits and pieces of it published in books and articles over the
years. Gore's father, Albert Gore Sr., even described the ties in a
memorandum for the Clinton campaign when aides were checking his
son's background before picking him as the running mate in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the pasts and legacies of both Gore and Gov. George W.
Bush of Texas come under scrutiny in a new presidential campaign,
the relationship of the Gore family with Hammer is once again
drawing scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, Hammer sold the farmland to the elder Gore, then
Gore turned around and sold it to his son, at the time a newspaper
reporter in Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Gore said in Nashville that there had been nothing
improper about his family's relationship with Occidental and that
the company's mineral lease on the farmland had been the result of
a free market negotiation.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with Gore's campaign and his White House office do not
dispute the basic elements of the land deal. They also said that
there had been nothing wrong with the transaction or with Gore's
subsequent dealings with Occidental and Hammer, who died in 1990.
The aides said the roots of the deal and the relationship were in
the friendship between Gore's father, who died in 1998, and Hammer.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Gore was a member of the House and Hammer was a
wealthy businessman when they met in the 1940s at a livestock
auction near the Gore family farm near Carthage, about 50 miles
east of Nashville. Eventually the two men entered into a
partnership raising and selling cattle, but that was only the start
of a connection that lasted until Hammer's death.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Hammer would become a legendary tycoon, courting
politicians and leaders worldwide and operating many businesses.
His close ties with the Soviet Union, where he had run a family
company for nine years as a young man, and his freewheeling ethics
brought him brushes with the law. In 1976, he was convicted of
illegally contributing $54,000 to President Richard M. Nixon's 1972
campaign, though he was later pardoned. Along the way, Hammer
helped make the elder Gore a wealthy man, and the politician became
one of the oilman's most valued allies in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   When J. Edgar Hoover, the director of the FBI, wanted to
prosecute Hammer on suspicion of being an agent of the Soviet Union
in the early 1960s, Gore Sr. defended him on the Senate floor.
Hammer was not charged.
</P>
<P>
   Letters in the elder Gore's papers, which are in an archive at
Middle Tennessee State University, show that he provided many other
favors to Hammer. For instance, he intervened with the Defense
Department when Hammer's son, Julian, was having trouble getting a
security clearance because of legal problems, and he persuaded the
FBI to let an agent testify on behalf of Hammer's company in a
civil trial, according to the letters.
</P>
<P>
   In 1965, Gore Sr. helped obtain visas to Libya for Hammer, his
wife and two business associates when Occidental was trying to open
oil fields in that country, according to a letter. The Libyan oil
concession transformed Occidental into a major player in the oil
market.
</P>
<P>
   Hammer repaid the favors in many ways, large and small. He sent
expensive Christmas gifts to Gore Sr. and his wife, Pauline,
according to the letters. After Gore was defeated in his 1970
Senate re-election bid, Hammer appointed him chairman of an
Occidental subsidiary and put him on the parent company's board of
directors. One of Hammer's biographers, Edward Jay Epstein, wrote
that Gore had never been rich until he went to work for Hammer.
</P>
<P>
   Another fruit of the friendship was the zinc-mining lease. Gore
Sr. had leased some of his farmland to Occidental for mining after
zinc was discovered in the area in the 1960s. In 1972, Occidental
bought a nearby farm, plus its mineral rights, for $160,000 at
Hammer's insistence. Gore Sr. said he had suggested that Occidental
buy the land.
</P>
<P>
   How the vice president came to own the second farm was recounted
in a 1992 article in The Washington Post and described in a
statement that the elder Gore prepared for an arbitration case
involving another mineral lease.
</P>
<P>
   In the statement, Gore Sr. said Hammer told him after buying the
nearby farm that the company wanted only the mineral rights and had
no need for the land. Hammer asked Gore Sr. to buy the property
from Occidental. The elder Gore said he agreed to buy the land for
the same price of $160,000, but insisted that Occidental pay him
$20,000 a year for the mineral rights, well above the price for
most leases in the area. Hammer agreed and Occidental sold the land
to Gore Sr. in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   The terms were highly favorable for the elder Gore because, with
the annual lease payment from Occidental, he would be able recoup
what he paid for the land in just eight years.
</P>
<P>
   Land records here show that a year later, 1974, the younger
Gore, then a newspaper reporter, paid his father $140,000 for the
land and the mineral lease. The price was apparently reduced
because his father had received one year's lease payment.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has owned the land, and collected the lease payments, ever
since, although there was no mining there until 1985, after
Occidental sold the mineral rights to Union Zinc. The rights have
changed hands twice since then and the current owner is Pasminco,
an Australian company.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's farm is a hilly parcel of 88 acres with a single-story
brick house overlooking the Caney Fork River, about 2 miles east of
Carthage, his hometown. Guardhouses on roads to the front and back
of the house are the only indications that the modest home is owned
by Gore, who rarely visits.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The pastures are laced with tunnels more than 1,000 feet deep
for mining zinc, which is used primarily to prevent corrosion in
steel. The mine itself, surrounded by large piles of tailings, sits
about half a mile down a gravel road from Gore's house on a
separate piece of land owned outright by Pasminco.
</P>
<P>
   The long-running mineral lease was not the only link between the
younger Gore and Hammer. While in Congress, Gore was host to Hammer
at President Ronald Reagan's 1985 inauguration and at President
George Bush's inauguration in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Former Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., wrote in a 1989 book that Hammer
promised him ``any cabinet spot I wanted'' to withdraw from the
1988 Democratic presidential primary race and support the younger
Gore's candidacy. There was no indication that Gore knew of
Hammer's offer.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's connections to Occidental resurfaced this year after the
company bought the federal government's share of a huge oil field
near Bakersfield, Calif., known as Elk Hills. The 47,000-acre tract
was acquired by the government in 1912 to ensure that the Navy had
sufficient oil reserves, but it was deemed no longer necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The government had tried to sell Elk Hills since the Reagan
administration, but succeeded only two years ago as part of Gore's
initiative to streamline the bureaucracy and ``reinvent
government.''
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department sold the property to Occidental for $3.65
billion in cash through a competitive bidding process that drew 22
offers. Department officials said Occidental's price was twice the
next-highest bid and double what the government had estimated. The
sale was announced in October 1997 and completed in February 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, questions about the extent of Gore's role in
the sale were raised in a book, ``The Buying of the President
2000,'' by Charles Lewis and the Center for Public Integrity, a
Washington nonprofit organization.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Department officials provided some records but declined
to release the bid documents, saying they remain confidential.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Fry Godley, who oversaw the sale as an assistant
secretary of the Energy Department, said Elk Hills had been put on
the block because the Navy no longer needed its oil reserves. She
said the selection had been made under the general orders of the
``reinventing government'' program, but that neither Gore nor
anyone from his office had been involved in the choice of Elk Hills
or its sale.
</P>
<P>
   Records show other federal agencies had concerns about the sale.
The Environmental Protection Agency complained to the Energy
Department that the EPA had insufficient information to assess the
impact of the sale. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service questioned
the impact of developing the oil field on several endangered
species within the 47,000 acres.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Department officials went ahead with the sale because
they said they were under pressure to meet a sale deadline imposed
by Congress and that all environmental concerns had been met before
the deal was closed.
</P>
<P>
   The Elk Hills purchase sent Occidental's share price up about 10
percent at the time, which increased the value of stock held by
Gore Sr. Since his death, the stock has remained in his estate,
whose primary beneficiary is his wife. The vice president's most
recent financial disclosure report valued the stock at $250,000 to
$500,000.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is executor of the estate, but his aides say that he
exercises no control over the stock in the estate and has never
owned Occidental stock himself. But it is the estate holding that
is making him a target of environmental groups protesting
Occidental's activities in Colombia. Stephen Kretzmann of Amazon
Watch, one of the groups, said Gore met with him and several other
environmentalists last month. Kretzmann said Gore explained that he
could not interfere in a Colombian internal issue or Occidental's
practices.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Tree experts around New York City and Chicago are
girding for a warm-weather offensive against a creature, little
more than an inch long, that could destroy as much woodland as some
of the worst forest fires in history.
</P>
<P>
   The creature is the Asian long-horned beetle, which kills trees
by eating them from the inside and which has no natural enemies in
the United States. Once a tree is infected, it is doomed. Thousands
of trees have been felled and ground into bits to try to check the
beetles' advance.
</P>
<P>
   Federal and state agriculture officials have spent several
million dollars and expect to spend millions more in fighting the
beetle, which was first spotted in the United States four years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Department of Agriculture has assigned some of its top
experts to the campaign. Now, the department and the Environmental
Protection Agency are weighing whether to use a nicotine-based
pesticide, one they think would carry minimal risks to people and
other trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is potentially a very, very serious problem,''
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said in a recent interview. ``If
established, this beetle could have a severe impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials who have followed the problem say huge tracts of
forest could be ruined, changing landscapes for generations.
Vermont, which relies on maple trees for its syrup business and its
famed autumn foliage, has particular reason to worry. Maples are
among the many trees the beetle loves to dine on, although none of
the creatures have been spotted in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Female beetles bore deep into trees to lay their eggs. When the
eggs become larvae, they eat their way back out, flying away as
adults and leaving their doomed hosts pocked with perfectly round
holes. Because adult beetles are active only in the summer and
fall, their pursuers are mapping their plans now.
</P>
<P>
   Glickman and several others involved in the fight said that they
were optimistic and that this year would be the turning point. They
think the nicotine-based pesticide will work even though others
have not. But they conceded that there was a long battle ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to eradicate it,'' said Vic Mastro, an
entomologist with the Department of Agriculture. ``It's not going
to be an easy or short process. But we said that at the
beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning, there was Greenpoint, Brooklyn. The beetle's
first known outpost in this country was discovered there in 1996,
after the beetle-colonists traveled from China in a shipping
container.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, the beetles were found in other sections of
Brooklyn, then in parts of Queens and Manhattan. Soon, they were in
Amityville, and soon after that elsewhere on Long Island. More than
4,000 trees were cut down in the New York region, some of them
magnificent giants that were saplings when Lincoln was president.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought we had it off the mainland,'' said Joe Gittleman,
the federal Agriculture Department's leading beetle fighter in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   So there was a sense of dread in 1998 when long-horned beetles
were found in the Chicago area, perhaps because young beetles
hitched a ride on a truck fender, or in logs from infected trees.
More than 1,000 infected trees have been cut down around Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The Forest Service and local agencies have been planting new
trees, of species less susceptible to the beetles, but it will be
years before they are as tall as the ones that were lost.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say the Chinese have agreed to treat wooden shipping
pallets, in an effort to stop more beetles from coming to the
United States. Quarantines have been imposed on firewood from areas
where infected trees have been found. Scores of warehouses have
been inspected.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Kruse, the Agriculture Department's beetle-campaign leader
in Chicago, said tree trimmers and landscapers had been very
cooperative in identifying and destroying infected trees. ``But how
do you get the last one?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Still, although the battle is long and hard, it is also
interesting for scientists who were not previously familiar with
the Asian long-horned beetle. ``It's something you could spend a
career on,'' Mastro said. Not that he wants to.

COMMENTARY: THE HEART WANTS ... 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MAUREEN DOWD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Al Gore was supposed to be the SNAG in this race, the Sensitive
New Age Guy sharing his feelings.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president, after all, was the one who believed in using
principles of therapy to run his White House office, who brought a
facilitator to Camp David so the cabinet could bond over childhood
insecurities, who gave weepy prime-time convention speeches about
his son's accident and his sister's cancer.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, oddly enough, it is W., the alleged SWAG (Swaggering
Carnivorous Texan), who is forcing us to focus on his feelings.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's emotions are so close to the surface that we always know
if he's testy or tired or aggrieved or homesick or defensive or
cocky.
</P>
<P>
   He can be sketchy on issues and foreign leaders, but he
constantly fires off bulletins about his state of mind: ``I am
tough enough. I know how to lead. I am ready. I am steeled. I can
handle adversity. I am real comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   These assertions are intended to counter fears that he lacks the
fiber to run the big show. It's the same sort of shorthand his
father used with ``Message: I care.'' W., too, is always reading
his stage directions aloud, protesting that he  &UR; will not be
defined &LR; . Clearly, he hasn't pondered the implications of being a
person without definition.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than proving he has the qualities of mind to be
president, he yammers about his heart: ``I'll tell you what's on my
heart,'' he says, or ``Don't you judge my heart.'' Billy Graham
``planted a seed in my heart,'' he said, and Christ ``changed my
heart.'' He'll give the party ``a compassionate heart.''
</P>
<P>
   He made another cardiological revelation last week in a
startling interview with The New York Times' Richard Berke and
Frank Bruni. It would have been so easy, and savvy, for W. to waft
an olive branch John McCain's way. But he preferred to vouchsafe
the American public another glimpse of his innermost self.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite the bruising, bitter and sometimes humbling nature of
his primary campaign against McCain,'' the reporters wrote, ``the
governor emerged without any regrets about his campaign's conduct,
any second thoughts about his strategy or any new resolves for the
way he positions himself for the general election.''
</P>
<P>
   The wild McCain ride is a phenomenon of profound interest,
especially to a pol. But W. once more displayed an unnerving lack
of curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   He was clearly irritated that his great victory was being
sullied by pesky questions about the guy he squashed. He regards
John McCain as a nuisance and a party pooper, an impertinent
interference in the adulation that W. believes is his due. He
thinks McCain was a hypocrite on campaign finance reform who got
more admiration than he deserved.
</P>
<P>
   Some old Bush hands had predicted that W. was too tetchy, too
much like his mother, to handle a national campaign. And that
prickly, sarcastic, grudge-collecting side blazed in the interview.
(Afterward, W. lamely tried to say he was taken out of context, but
the text belied it.)
</P>
<P>
   He was not the uniter he had promised to be. He was the Loyalty
Enforcer he used to be for his dad. McCain had had the temerity to
challenge W.'s coronation and throw a spotlight on his weaknesses.
The gracious Bushes have a strangely Nixonian quality: You're
either with them or against them.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, in an equally disturbing Times interview last week,
Al Gore revealed that he has no feelings. He tried to wrap himself
not only in the aura of John McCain, but also Jesse Ventura.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's emotional efficiency is a little terrifying: Like many
politicians, he will do what has to be done, except that in his
case, there is no evidence of anguish. He will shapeshift brazenly,
going from campaign finance abuser to campaign finance reformer,
with no trace of shame. He is chillingly consistent in his
indifference to his inconsistencies.
</P>
<P>
   He has the temperament of the class snitch. Whenever W. acts the
chucklehead, Al raises his hand to make sure it has escaped
nobody's attention. After Bush's Times interview, Gore tut-tutted:
``I think he should have been taking notes from John McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   So this is our choice? President Rattle or President Tattle?

   LONDON _ For a few days last week it suddenly occurred to
American investors that tech stocks might be a bit, um,
speculative, and they hurried back to what they somehow imagine to
be the safety of old-economy blue chips. (Hey, some of these
mammals might not make it; better put your money on the dinosaurs.)
But sitting in England, where tech fever is more recent but, if
anything, runs even hotter, I feel the urge to put in something of
a good word for the American technology boom. Put it this way: Our
investors seem moderate, sensible and on the right track _ at least
when you compare them with their counterparts elsewhere in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   The big story of the week here was the IPO of Lastminute.com,
which has a concept very similar to that of Priceline.com. Martha
Lane Fox, the firm's 27-year-old co-founder, graced the cover of
just about every national newspaper. And why not? At the end of its
first day as a public company the firm _ which needless to say
loses money, and had fourth-quarter sales of only about $650,000 _
had a market valuation of more than $1 billion. Americans may be
used to that sort of thing, but in England it's still a novelty.
</P>
<P>
   But while Lane Fox is photogenic, and for all I know very much
on top of her business, what the newspapers here really seem to
like about her is that she comes from a very posh family (the
double-barreled name is a giveaway). Her father is a well-known
historian, and _ as every article managed to point out in the
second or third paragraph _ she is descended from the sixth
Marquess of Anglesey.
</P>
<P>
   She is not an isolated instance. Last month's big British IPO
was Oxygen, an ``incubator'' firm that is supposed to make money by
backing other people's business ideas. Its stock soared 3,000
percent on the first day, to a value something like 20 times its
capital. (As an English friend put it, the valuation depends on
Oxygen being able to find clients smart enough to come up with
great business ideas yet dumb enough to sell those ideas for 5
percent of what they are worth.) What was Oxygen's appeal? Its
extraordinary list of founders, including Elisabeth Murdoch
(daughter of you-know-who) and Matthew Freud, a famed publicist who
is the good doctor's great-grandson.
</P>
<P>
   Even The Financial Times found itself moved to a bit of populist
bile: ``The Internet, which was supposed to be a great leveler _
cutting through class and traditional networks _ has instead
quickly become a platform for the rise of a new/old moneyed elite.
The names of some individuals read like an extract from Debrett's
((the reference book on the aristocracy)).''
</P>
<P>
   But I don't really mean to single out Britain. There are other
places where the same phenomenon _ investor enthusiasm for the new
economy mysteriously turning into a get-richer-quick scheme for
elite families _ has literally run wild. In Hong Kong police had to
be called out to control the crowds trying to purchase shares in
Tom.com, an Internet offering by the powerful businessman Li
Ka-shing. And the market placed such a high valuation on Pacific
Century Cyberworks, a company founded by his son, Richard Li, that
Li the younger was able to take control of Hong Kong's principal
telephone company. (An Asian version of AOL-Time Warner? Not quite:
Pacific Century has no subscribers and almost no revenue.)
</P>
<P>
   Now the U.S. is not a classless meritocracy. Our next president
will not be a self-made man. Our business elite, as my MIT
colleague Peter Temin points out in a recent paper, still consists
disproportionately of tall men from well-off WASP families. Still,
it's hard to imagine American investors pouring money into a
company that has no plausible business plan, simply because the
founder comes from a prominent family.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, to a remarkable extent America's new economy seems to be
the creation of new men (and a few new women). Not only weren't
they born to wealth; in many cases they are immigrants or the
children of immigrants. (Asians own nearly a quarter of Silicon
Valley startups.) The old line that ``It's not what you know, it's
who you know'' has never seemed less true.
</P>
<P>
   So let's hear it for America, where our technology stars are
selling ideas, not connections and _ who knows? _ might actually
make money for their stockholders.

CRITICS OF `PREDATORY LENDING' TAKE AIM AT WALL STREET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.)  (mk) 
 By DIANA B. HENRIQUES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Mayor Richard M. Daley of Chicago announced last Wednesday
that he was backing a broad city campaign against ``predatory
lending,'' he helped spotlight what consumer advocates say is a
small but growing challenge to the banks and big Wall Street
institutions that help finance high-cost home equity loans.
</P>
<P>
   Those efforts include plans for picket lines in Washington by
neighborhood groups and increased shareholder activism by major
institutional investors.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with sharply escalating foreclosure rates in some
working-class neighborhoods of Chicago, Daley has proposed an
ordinance that would require every financial institution seeking to
do business with the city to attest that it has not engaged in
predatory lending, either directly or through an affiliated
company.
</P>
<P>
   The ordinance, which will face a vote by the City Council next
month, is a direct challenge to the big banks and other
institutions that have expanded into the growing business known as
subprime home equity lending, so called because it caters to
homeowners with less than top-quality credit.
</P>
<P>
   Spurred at first by financial deregulation in the early 1980s
and more recently by access to Wall Street's secondary mortgage
market, subprime home equity lending has become an increasingly
important feature in the consumer finance landscape. But the
industry's growth has been accompanied by complaints from consumer
advocates and state regulators about deceptive sales practices and
home equity loans structured in ways that, they say, increase the
likelihood of default and foreclosure.
</P>
<P>
   Daley's proposal has strong support on the City Council, said
Alderman Theodore Thomas, who has his own anti-predatory-lending
plan pending before the council but said he would support the
mayor's plan.
</P>
<P>
   As the Chicago initiative indicates, some organizations
concerned about predatory lending are beginning to look beyond the
lenders themselves to focus on the banks or Wall Street
institutions that are increasingly important players in the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   One concerned organization is the Social Investment Forum, a
nonprofit association for investment professionals and institutions
in the $2.16 trillion industry of ``socially responsible''
investing, which includes mutual funds, pension funds and
endowments that screen their portfolios to avoid products or
services they consider harmful to society.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, many socially responsible investors have shunned
tobacco company stocks, casino gambling companies and clothing
manufacturers accused of using sweatshop labor. Others have used
their muscle as large institutional shareholders to pressure
companies involved in these products or activities.
</P>
<P>
   On March 6, the group's board of directors endorsed a national
campaign against predatory lending. The campaign includes a call
for shareholder activism and support for screening portfolios to
exclude securities that help support those involved in making such
loans, said David J. Berge, the group's president.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be looking at who the worst offenders in this area
are, and at what large-block shareholders can do to address that
behavior,'' Berge said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said, the group intends to develop a practical
way to identify investments that those concerned about predatory
lending should avoid.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all would like to believe that a lot of the money that's
been put out there to support predatory lending is just a result of
a lack of education,'' Berge said. ``Once people are aware of the
kind of behavior they're supporting, we believe they will be
willing and anxious to make changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Berge said, the group will help support those who are
resisting predatory lending at the grass-roots level by encouraging
investors to steer at least 1 percent of their portfolios into
neighborhood organizations working to support affordable housing.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the organization's campaign will be worked out at
meetings next month and posted on the Web site
www.socialinvest.org, Berge said.
</P>
<P>
   In another form of activism, a coalition of community
organizations is planning demonstrations on Monday at the
Washington offices of Salomon Smith Barney, the giant brokerage
company that has helped finance several large subprime lenders.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstration is planned by the Association of Community
Organizations for Reform Now, known as ACORN, as part of a
conference focusing on predatory lending.
</P>
<P>
   ACORN's executive director, Steve Kest, said Salomon Smith
Barney was singled out because it is one of the largest purchasers
of loans from Ameriquest Mortgage Co., which ``we believe is one of
the most egregious of the subprime lenders we have studied.''
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, for example, Salomon raised nearly $800 million to
buy more than 6,200 mortgages from Ameriquest with an average
interest rate of 9.56 percent, roughly 2 points higher than
conventional mortgages.
</P>
<P>
   ACORN has staged demonstrations at various offices of
Ameriquest, which is based in Orange, Calif. Asked about the
group's accusations Friday, an Ameriquest spokesman denied that the
company had engaged in predatory lending and cited its support for
consumer education programs aimed at low-income and minority
homeowners.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman said that ACORN's accusations were disputed by
another grass-roots organization, the National Association of
Neighborhoods in Washington, which has conducted consumer education
programs that have been financially supported by the mortgage
company.
</P>
<P>
   Ricardo Byrd, the association's executive director, confirmed
that his group ``considers Ameriquest to be one of the enlightened
lenders.''
</P>
<P>
   Byrd added: ``We support ACORN shedding light in this area. But
we think they have unfairly targeted Ameriquest.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Salomon Smith Barney, Duncan King, said the
company declined to comment on the demonstration or its
relationship with Ameriquest.

   SAN LUIS OBISPO, Calif. _ The Gazettes still arrive every
Thursday in every home, post office box and business in San Luis
Obispo County, fat with high school basketball scores and the
latest City Council arguments. The front page still carries the
slogan ``Hometown journalism at its best.''
</P>
<P>
   And despite making more news in the last few weeks than their
owner would ever see fit to print, The San Luis Obispo and
Atascadero Gazettes are doing better than ever, says Todd Hansen,
the weeklies' chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Hansen said, since the papers' policy of not ``promoting
the gay lifestyle or abortion'' _ not writing any articles on the
subjects that may be construed as supportive _ was made explicit a
month ago, there has been some fallout. Reporters and editors have
quit en masse. Advertisers have pulled out. Readers have asked that
their names be removed from the mailing list.
</P>
<P>
   But he said: ``We've actually had our best week in advertising
revenue last week. We've had advertisers step up and say, `I got to
be in San Luis now.' We have a better staff, everybody is aware of
us now, everybody who works for us has a clear understanding of our
beliefs and we feel we are by far a better paper.''
</P>
<P>
   And there is one other thing: ``We've got all this free media,''
Hansen said with a laugh. ``If you didn't know about the Gazettes,
you sure as heck know about them now.''
</P>
<P>
   True enough. Over a few weeks, several small newspapers in this
part of the central California coast, with its easy-on-the-eyes
landscape of old missions and working farms, have stirred an
earthquake's worth of ruckus. And it is not over.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps partly because the controversy centers on freedom of the
press, one of journalists' favorite topics, and perhaps partly
because it concerns two of the most important issues of the day for
the religious right, homosexuality and abortion, this story has
legs. The dozen or so reporters and editors who have quit the two
weeklies spend a great deal of time talking to talk-show hosts or
to other reporters from all over.
</P>
<P>
   The Gazettes, Hansen said, are inundated with calls and letters
_ ``80 percent of them supportive'' _ and the city of San Luis
Obispo, a trendy, liberal bastion surrounded by conservative
Republicans in the countryside, is more fired up than anyone here
can remember.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a story that I think is important because it goes beyond
the hot-button issues,'' said Ron Bast, a longtime local writer who
quit his job as editor of The Atascadero Gazette over the policy.
``Everybody has a take on gays and abortion. But I think we all
have a sense of what's fair. It's just patently obvious that in
this case what the owner is doing is not fair.''
</P>
<P>
   When a local multimillionaire, David Weyrich, holder of a vast
development empire, began the first of his weekly papers, The Paso
Robles Gazette, in July, readers and journalists were excited.
</P>
<P>
   By October, when the next two newspapers, the San Luis Obispo
and Atascadero Gazettes, began publishing, San Luis Obispo County
was abuzz with the possibilities of community journalism. All three
weeklies are free, and are distributed to 120,000 households and
businesses in the county.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember having a conversation with Ron Bast, the editor, in
February about how much fun it was to be doing The Atascadero
Gazette,'' said Kathy Johnston, a feature writer for San Luis
Obispo magazine (which was bought by the Gazette Newspaper Group)
before she began covering the City Council for the Atascadero
weekly in October. ``We thought it was great fun because Atascadero
is not a town that has had any media scrutiny, and these reporters
came along and reported what was out there and put it in everyone's
mailbox.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was in that conversation with Bast, she said, that the
editor told her the fun might be ending.
</P>
<P>
   Hansen had warned the publisher of The Atascadero Gazette, Steve
Martin, to stop running an item announcing the monthly meeting of
the Parents and Friends of Gays and Lesbians, known locally as P
Flag. Later, he made it clear that not only was P Flag banned from
the paper, but also any letters protesting the ban and any
editorials or articles that showed support for gay rights or
pro-choice views on abortion.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Bast, referring to Hansen, said: ``I asked him how we would
cover the annual AIDS bike-a-thon from San Francisco to Los
Angeles, which brings 10,000 people through town, presumably most
of them in support of gays. He said we won't cover it.''
</P>
<P>
   To explain the newspaper group's position, Weyrich and his wife,
Mary, the parents of eight children, wrote a front page editorial _
their first and last word on the subject _ in the Gazettes on Feb.
24. ``We strongly believe in the family, as God defines it, and we
are strong supporters of the sanctity of life,'' it read in part.
``These are not always popular beliefs in our society today.''
</P>
<P>
   In San Luis Obispo, which has a sizable gay and lesbian
population, the news of the ban was met with sadness and
disappointment. Charles Myers, who owns the Big Sky Cafe and is
gay, printed cards for the staff members who quit the papers,
offering them free meals. The Chamber of Commerce and Downtown
Association voted to remove their advertisements from the Gazettes,
and the performing arts center pulled its items from the papers'
calendars.
</P>
<P>
   But Hansen said that while San Luis Obispo was roiled ``because
it tends to be more liberal,'' towns like Atascadero and Paso
Robles were buoyed by the policy. ``We just started two more papers
on March 9,'' Hansen said, ``and counting the countywide revenues,
we just expect to be doing better and better.''

SISTERS RECALL THE SAINT AMONG THEM
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., N.M., La.)   (jw) 
 By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   BENSALEM, Pa. _ The first time the young heiress from
Rittenhouse Square made headlines was in 1889 when The Philadelphia
Public Ledger bannered: ``Miss Drexel Enters a Catholic Convent _
Gives Up Seven Million.''
</P>
<P>
   But Katharine Drexel, while embracing the vow of poverty, did
not quite give up the family fortune accumulated by her father,
Francis, a banking partner of J.P. Morgan's. Rather, she invested
it in two of the most abused groups in 19th-century America as she
dared to create a congregation of missionary nuns dedicated to
educating post-slavery blacks and American Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Her innovation was no less a sensation in its day than is the
latest Drexel headline, ``Pope Announces Sainthood for Champion of
Minorities,'' which is slowly sinking in here in this highway-laced
bedroom community north of Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican, having deemed two cures of gravely ill children
miraculous, has announced that the onetime socialite will indeed be
St. Katharine Drexel, as of October.
</P>
<P>
   Hotels have already begun calling the Sisters of the Blessed
Sacrament in anticipation of fresh waves of pilgrims to Blessed
Katharine's tomb here at the motherhouse. In preparation for the
modern ways of faith, the sisters have joined the Internet
(www.katharinedrexel.org) and are stocking the souvenir shop with
some of the most eclectic arrays of sacramentals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in awe,'' Mayor Joe DiGirolamo said at the very idea of
St. Katharine. He is busy designing new traffic controls even as he
makes plans to be in Rome for the canonization. He recalls the
saint from his boyhood as an eye-catching wisp of a matriarch late
in life, staring out from her wheelchair at the working-class
strivers of Bensalem.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the motherhouse, proud smiles abound. There are some
stunning recollections of Katharine Drexel, who was raised to see
the poor as individuals invited three times a week to her parents'
Philadelphia mansion for a discreet family dole.
</P>
<P>
   ``She'd be shocked at this,'' Sister Thomasita Daley said. A
lively octogenarian, Sister Thomasita dwelled on the founder's
humanity and determined humility _ plain qualities the sisters
acknowledge are at risk of being lost in the mist of hagiography
and the approaching busloads of tourists.
</P>
<P>
   For this reason, Sister Beatrice Jefferies, the order's vice
president, likes to hear the few surviving nuns who knew Mother
Katharine sit around and talk of her as a resourceful woman more
than a mesmerizing saint. ``We have to keep telling the stories,''
she emphasized.
</P>
<P>
   Sister Thomasita knew Mother Katharine as a spiritual role model
and hard-driving businesswoman often on the road but in the
background as she built the order into a formidable sisterhood of
500 women teaching in ghettoes and on Indian reservations in 21
states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, honey, we turned them out,'' Sister Thomasita said
proudly of the tens of thousands of graduates. Mother Katharine
predated the nation's civil rights struggle by 70 years, building
scores of schools and convents and a college for her needy
youngsters, Xavier College in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there would Mother Katharine be, patching her stockings in
the evening alongside the rest of us,'' said Sister Thomasita, who
was a novice when she met the durable founder, who died in 1955 at
the age of 96.
</P>
<P>
   Mother Katharine was a shrewd talent scout, sending recruiters
to the Catholic farm villages of Ireland and scooping up Inez
Carney 67 years ago in a group of 19 adventurous colleens from
County Mayo. ``I've had a great time,'' said Sister Inez, an elfin
nun, looking back at a career in which she amassed lifelong friends
as she taught in numerous Southern ghettoes and Western
reservations of the Apache, Navajo, Pueblo and Osage tribes.
</P>
<P>
   Sister Inez helped nurse Mother Katharine in her final years.
Rather than recalling saintly deeds, she remains impressed at how
the founder demanded all the homespun limits of poverty, down to a
severe wooden chair when she was infirm. ``She could have had a
grand big lounge chair!'' Sister Inez said. ``She could have had
anything,'' she said, touching once more on the riches-to-wimple
tale that first beguiled Americans over a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, that famous Drexel fortune, which amounted to $20
million across time, is gone now, the trust funds having reverted
to other family charities with the death of Mother Katharine.
``It's very difficult right now,'' admitted Sister Faith Okerson,
while hardly doubting the survival of an order that, like other
modern sisterhoods, has had its membership dwindle to half.
</P>
<P>
   Most painfully, the sisters recently had to close Mother
Katharine's very first mission, the 111-year-old St. Catherine's
school on the Pueblo reservation in Santa Fe, N.M. A tribal leader,
Joe Abeyta Sr., sorrowfully traveled here to pray and put sacred
corn pollen on Mother Katharine's crypt. The nuns recorded what he
prayed: ``Mother Katharine, you loved me, you came to my house. You
have taught us well and we are ready to lead.''

 &HT;    TAIWAN ELECTS PRO-INDEPENDENCE PRESIDENT IN FACE OF BEIJING
THREATS

   TAIPEI _ The people of Taiwan spoke loudly and clearly against
corruption and Chinese intimidation Saturday, kicking out the
ruling party after more than 50 years of political domination and
electing Chen Shui-bian, a former Taipei mayor and lawyer for
political dissidents, as president.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the opposition Democratic Progressive Party
triumph, the margin was larger than what most people expected and
what months of neck-and-neck polling suggested: Chen got 39 percent
of the vote; independent James Soong 37 percent; and Vice President
Lien Chan of the ruling Nationalist Party had just 23 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Voters were swayed neither by repeated warnings from Lien that a
victory by Chen, whose party calls for formal independence for
Taiwan, could lead to war with China, nor by a recent speech of
Chinese premier Zhu Rongji reiterating Beijing's willingness to use
force to prevent Taiwan independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to thank Zhu Rongji for helping us elect Chen
Shui-bian,'' said a Taipei accountant surnamed He, shouting above
the din of fireworks, air horns and general merriment of tens of
thousands of Taipei residents who turned out at Chen's campaign
headquarters to celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome was also an unmistakable message to the Nationalist
Party that voters see it as corrupt and tied too closely with mafia
elements. Both Chen and Soong campaigned as clean-government
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``(With a) 39% vote for Chen and 37% vote for independent James
Soong, the 'throw the rascals out' message was the clearest message
from this vote,'' said John Tkacik(CQ), a former U.S. diplomat who
now publishes a weekly business bulletin on Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   As for China, he said it may now be forced to re-evaluate its
Taiwan policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Politburo moderates in Beijing are now telling the
hard-liners, 'See! I told you the heavy-handed bullying would only
blow up in our faces. The time has come to completely revise our
approach to Taiwan,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The two governments have been estranged since the Nationalists
lost a civil war to Mao Zedong's communist party in 1949 and fled
to Taiwan. Reunifying Taiwan with the mainland is one of Beijing's
top priorities.
</P>
<P>
   As the campaign progressed, Chen backed down from his party's
independence platform, sounding more like his opponents in pledging
to negotiate with China and not make any drastic changes in policy.
</P>
<P>
   In his victory speech Saturday, he said he wanted to make a
``journey of reconciliation'' to China before his inauguration. He
also invited Chinese president Jiang Zemin and Premier Zhu to visit
Taiwan. Yet he added that Taiwan's sovereignty would be eternal and
Taiwan would never become a second Hong Kong, which reverted to
Chinese rule in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Chen also proposed a ``peace agreement'' and ``military
confidence-building'' measures, but did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued by state-run news media, the Chinese
government reacted cautiously, saying it would wait and see what
Chen would say and do. The election results ``will not change the
status of Taiwan as a part of China,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, President Bill Clinton congratulated Chen on his
victory and said the United States ``strongly supports'' dialogue
between China and Taiwan ``and is committed to promoting peace,
stability and prosperity in the region.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the election provides a fresh opportunity for both
sides to reach out and resolve their differences peacefully through
dialogue,'' he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue to conduct close unofficial ties with the
people on Taiwan through the American Institute in Taiwan in
accordance with the Taiwan Relations Act and our one-China
policy,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Chen and his party have been criticized for their lack of
experience in the foreign policy arena, having never held
national-level office.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may not have high-level credibility to conduct his mainland
policy,'' said Szu-yin Ho, professor of political science at
National Chengchi University in Taipei. ``China will probably not
give Chen any benefit of the doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   His supporters counter that he is better positioned to negotiate
with China because people in Taiwan will not second-guess his
motives, just as Richard Nixon, a fierce anti-communist, was able
to establish relations with China 28 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, Soong supporters are troubled by the thought of a Chen
Shui-bian presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very worried about relations across the Taiwan Straits,''
said Susan Chang, 28. ``We don't want to underestimate the military
power of China.''
</P>
<P>
   She is also pessimistic about the economic effects of Chen's
victory. At her job at a Taipei bank, she saw long lines of people
converting their money to U.S. dollars or transferring it out of
the country this past week. They were motivated first by a 6.6
percent drop in Taiwan's stock market Monday _ its largest
single-day decline ever _ and then by Zhu's fiery speech on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   David Yu, chairman of Summit National Bank in Atlanta, said he
knows of one bank branch in San Francisco that received $20 million
in transfers from Taiwan in the last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   After 51 years in power, the Nationalist Party has accumulated
massive riches and become entrenched not only in Taiwan's political
institutions but its financial ones as well. Political and economic
uncertainty are bound to ensue with Chen's victory, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I anticipate some chaos and confusion in Taiwan,'' Joseph Wu,
deputy director of the Institute of International Relations in
Taipei, said earlier this week. ``It would be the first time we
have a president who doesn't have a majority in the (parliament).''
</P>
<P>
   The Nationalists' huge defeat perhaps could have been foreseen
given a clear downward trend in the last 10 years in its share of
parliament and county-level seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the long run, the KMT is bound to be in trouble,'' Wu said.
``In the major urban areas, the KMT is starting to lose its grip.
This is an alarming sign.''
</P>
<P>
   Polls have shown that the Nationalist Party's strongest base of
support is in rural areas, among less-educated voters and older
voters. The opposition party is most popular among voters under 40
and the highly-educated.
</P>
<P>
   His head down, Lien said quietly in his concession speech that
he would engage in ``self-examination and self-criticism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you're going to see the disintegration of the party,''
said Yawei Liu, a Chinese native and history professor at Georgia
Perimeter College who has been in Taiwan for the past week to
observe the elections unofficially for the Carter Center.
</P>
<P>
   People have already been talking about Soong forming a new
party, which he hinted at in his concession speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of KMT members will quit and join Soong,'' said
Liu.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Chen, the other big winner in this election was
democracy itself, observers said. After Taiwan lifted 38 years of
martial law just 13 years ago, political reforms followed quickly,
with its first full parliamentary elections in 1992, its first
direct presidential election in 1996, and now, the first-ever
peaceful transition of power.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably unprecedented in the whole of Chinese
civilization _ one power replaced by another without bloodletting,
and all of the people accepting it,'' said Liu.
</P>
<P>
   The Taiwanese people themselves were enthusiastic about the
opportunity they had to influence their destiny. The voter turnout
rate was roughly 83 percent, which surpassed the already-high 74
percent turnout rate of the last presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Shin Chang, a Taiwan native who has lived in the United States
for 35 years, has been working since the 1980s for human rights and
democracy in Taiwan. He, along with more than 2,000 Chen supporters
from the U.S., returned to Taiwan this week to vote for their man.
</P>
<P>
   Chen's victory is ``the biggest fulfillment of my life,'' said
Chang, who retired last week after 25 years working in research and
development for Atlanta-based Coca-Cola Co. ``This is what I have
hoped for for a long time . . . the democratization of Taiwan.''

   ``(With a) 39% vote for Chen and 37% vote for independent James
Soong, the 'throw the rascals out' message was the clearest message
from this vote,'' said John Tkacik(CQ), a former U.S. diplomat who
now publishes a weekly business bulletin on Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   As for China, he said it may now be forced to re-evaluate its
Taiwan policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Politburo moderates in Beijing are now telling the
hard-liners, 'See! I told you the heavy-handed bullying would only
blow up in our faces. The time has come to completely revise our
approach to Taiwan,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The two governments have been estranged since the Nationalists
lost a civil war to Mao Zedong's communist party in 1949 and fled
to Taiwan. Reunifying Taiwan with the mainland is one of Beijing's
top priorities.
</P>
<P>
   As the campaign progressed, Chen backed down from his party's
independence platform, sounding more like his opponents in pledging
to negotiate with China and not make any drastic changes in policy.
</P>
<P>
   In his victory speech Saturday, he said he wanted to make a
``journey of reconciliation'' to China before his inauguration. He
also invited Chinese president Jiang Zemin and Premier Zhu to visit
Taiwan. Yet he added that Taiwan's sovereignty would be eternal and
Taiwan would never become a second Hong Kong, which reverted to
Chinese rule in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Chen also proposed a ``peace agreement'' and ``military
confidence-building'' measures, but did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued by state-run news media, the Chinese
government reacted cautiously, saying it would wait and see what
Chen would say and do. The election results ``will not change the
status of Taiwan as a part of China,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, President Bill Clinton congratulated Chen on his
victory and said the United States ``strongly supports'' dialogue
between China and Taiwan ``and is committed to promoting peace,
stability and prosperity in the region.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the election provides a fresh opportunity for both
sides to reach out and resolve their differences peacefully through
dialogue,'' he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue to conduct close unofficial ties with the
people on Taiwan through the American Institute in Taiwan in
accordance with the Taiwan Relations Act and our one-China
policy,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Chen and his party have been criticized for their lack of
experience in the foreign policy arena, having never held
national-level office.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may not have high-level credibility to conduct his mainland
policy,'' said Szu-yin Ho, professor of political science at
National Chengchi University in Taipei. ``China will probably not
give Chen any benefit of the doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   His supporters counter that he is better positioned to negotiate
with China because people in Taiwan will not second-guess his
motives, just as Richard Nixon, a fierce anti-communist, was able
to establish relations with China 28 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, Soong supporters are troubled by the thought of a Chen
Shui-bian presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very worried about relations across the Taiwan Straits,''
said Susan Chang, 28. ``We don't want to underestimate the military
power of China.''
</P>
<P>
   She is also pessimistic about the economic effects of Chen's
victory. At her job at a Taipei bank, she saw long lines of people
converting their money to U.S. dollars or transferring it out of
the country this past week. They were motivated first by a 6.6
percent drop in Taiwan's stock market Monday _ its largest
single-day decline ever _ and then by Zhu's fiery speech on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   David Yu, chairman of Summit National Bank in Atlanta, said he
knows of one bank branch in San Francisco that received $20 million
in transfers from Taiwan in the last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   After 51 years in power, the Nationalist Party has accumulated
massive riches and become entrenched not only in Taiwan's political
institutions but its financial ones as well. Political and economic
uncertainty are bound to ensue with Chen's victory, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I anticipate some chaos and confusion in Taiwan,'' Joseph Wu,
deputy director of the Institute of International Relations in
Taipei, said earlier this week. ``It would be the first time we
have a president who doesn't have a majority in the (parliament).''
</P>
<P>
   The Nationalists' huge defeat perhaps could have been foreseen
given a clear downward trend in the last 10 years in its share of
parliament and county-level seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the long run, the KMT is bound to be in trouble,'' Wu said.
``In the major urban areas, the KMT is starting to lose its grip.
This is an alarming sign.''
</P>
<P>
   Polls have shown that the Nationalist Party's strongest base of
support is in rural areas, among less-educated voters and older
voters. The opposition party is most popular among voters under 40
and the highly-educated.
</P>
<P>
   His head down, Lien said quietly in his concession speech that
he would engage in ``self-examination and self-criticism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you're going to see the disintegration of the party,''
said Yawei Liu, a Chinese native and history professor at Georgia
Perimeter College who has been in Taiwan for the past week to
observe the elections unofficially for the Carter Center.
</P>
<P>
   People have already been talking about Soong forming a new
party, which he hinted at in his concession speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of KMT members will quit and join Soong,'' said
Liu.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Chen, the other big winner in this election was
democracy itself, observers said. After Taiwan lifted 38 years of
martial law just 13 years ago, political reforms followed quickly,
with its first full parliamentary elections in 1992, its first
direct presidential election in 1996, and now, the first-ever
peaceful transition of power.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably unprecedented in the whole of Chinese
civilization _ one power replaced by another without bloodletting,
and all of the people accepting it,'' said Liu.
</P>
<P>
   The Taiwanese people themselves were enthusiastic about the
opportunity they had to influence their destiny. The voter turnout
rate was roughly 83 percent, which surpassed the already-high 74
percent turnout rate of the last presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Shin Chang, a Taiwan native who has lived in the United States
for 35 years, has been working since the 1980s for human rights and
democracy in Taiwan. He, along with more than 2,000 Chen supporters
from the U.S., returned to Taiwan this week to vote for their man.
</P>
<P>
   Chen's victory is ``the biggest fulfillment of my life,'' said
Chang, who retired last week after 25 years working in research and
development for Atlanta-based Coca-Cola Co. ``This is what I have
hoped for for a long time . . . the democratization of Taiwan.''

 &HT;    Bush passes smarts test given by voters
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Final report cards won't be issued until
November, but, so far, voters around the country have given Texas
Gov. George W. Bush passing grades on a question he didn't
anticipate facing on his road to the White House: Is this guy smart
enough to be president?
</P>
<P>
   A year into the presidential campaign, Bush's brainpower remains
the target of self-appointed smart guys and late-night comedians
who wonder aloud whether Texans have twice made a dumb guy their
governor.
</P>
<P>
   Newsweek recently ruminated about it in its ``The Buzz'' column,
noting Bush might need a ``wonk'' as a running mate but pointing
out, ``This strategy could backfire, though: too big a brain might
highlight Dubya's deficit.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, a former C student at Yale, insists the is-he-smart-enough
question doesn't faze him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't bother me because I know it's wrong. It's just part
of the game. It's part of the media elite game,'' he said of the
persistent inquiries about his IQ. ``I think anybody who doesn't
think I'm smart enough to handle the job is underestimating. I hope
Al Gore feels that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the barbs continue, exit polls from the primaries
indicate voters are not overly concerned about Bush's intelligence.
In several states, voters were asked if Bush ``knows enough'' to be
president. It's not exactly the same as: Is he smart enough, but it
comes close.
</P>
<P>
   In the Texas GOP primary, 90 percent of those questioned said he
knows enough to handle the job. In New York, 68 percent of the GOP
respondents agreed.
</P>
<P>
   In Michigan's GOP primary, won by Arizona Sen. John McCain, 66
percent of the respondents said Bush knows enough. But in what
could be a troubling statistic for Bush in a key state in November,
91 percent of the Republicans who said Bush does not know enough
voted for McCain, a number indicating those Republicans may be
hard-pressed to back Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bush will face a tougher set of graders, of course, when
Democrats are added to the mix in November. For example, in
California's recent open primary, opinion was split on whether Bush
knows enough to be president. Forty-eight percent said Bush knows
enough. Forty-three said he does not.
</P>
<P>
   And in perhaps the most telling statistic of all as Bush heads
toward November, the exit pollsters didn't feel compelled to ask
anyone whether they thought Vice President Al Gore, who clinched
the Democratic nomination last week, knows enough to be president.
</P>
<P>
   The smarts question began when Bush fouled up a television
reporter's pop quiz on world leaders and has been furthered by his
penchant for misspeak. A Canadian comedian recently got Bush to
express his appreciation for an endorsement from Canadian Prime
Minister Jean Poutine.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Bush, Jean Poutine is a type of Canadian fast
food. Jean Chretien is the Canadian prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, in discussing possible upcoming trips, Bush moved
Mexico to another continent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to go down to South America. There is a complicating
factor there. The Mexican presidential election is taking place and
I certainly don't want to get involved in that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Texans who have worked with and against Bush say they never
questioned his intelligence. Former Land Commissioner Garry Mauro,
Bush's 1998 for for governor, said he believes Bush lacks passion
for issues. But Mauro raises no concerns about the governor's
smarts.
</P>
<P>
   House Appropriations Chairman Rob Junell, a San Angelo Democrat
who has endorsed Bush for president, said the governor is a quick
learner who understands both the details and the big-picture
implications of complex issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not surprised by anything that goes on in these
campaigns,'' Junell said of the questions about Bush's
intelligence. ``They are going to make not only the governor, but
everybody from Texas look like a bunch of goobers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The vice president is from one of those intellectual Ivy
League states, Tennessee,'' said Junell.

 &HT;    The madness of renaming NCAA series `Mayhem'
 &HT;    By John Keilman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ To most hoop fans, the annual NCAA men's
basketball tournament is best known as March Madness. But that name
seems passe at CBS, the broadcast company that pounded the phrase
into the national consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   After years of hyping the competition as March Madness, the
network this year is pushing a different name: March Mayhem.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the switch lies in a thicket of corporate
connections and trademark disputes. The Illinois High School
Association claimed it coined March Madness in the 1940s to
describe its own basketball tournament. That was long before CBS
began using the phrase during broadcasts of the NCAA Tournament in
the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1990s, the association sued a video game maker that
licensed the name from the NCAA. The association said it was
entitled to royalties but three courts disagreed, saying March
Madness had come to signify the NCAA Tournament in the public mind.
</P>
<P>
   CBS continued to use the name, but the same wasn't true for its
Internet arm.
</P>
<P>
   Sportsline.com never had permission from the NCAA to use March
Madness, according to spokesman Larry Wahl. So in 1997,
Sportsline.com came up with the phrase March Mayhem, which has been
used in its Web coverage of the tournament ever since.
</P>
<P>
   A CBS spokeswoman says the network is entitled to use March
Madness on the air, but has been stressing March Mayhem to promote
its Internet offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the NCAA and the Illinois High School Association
agreed to share the term March Madness, forming a corporation to
control use of the trademark. Does that mean CBS _ will forget the
Mayhem and reclaim the Madness?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. Wahl says it's hard to tell whether anyone really cares
about the name.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think on the (Web) site that it matters that much,''
he said.

 &HT;    Winter gets its marching orders
 &HT;    By GRETEL DAUGHERTY
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. _ Ah, March.
</P>
<P>
   Named after Mars, the Roman god of war, this is the month when
winter and spring battle for possession of the earth.
</P>
<P>
   The two seasons prance around each other like fighters in a
ring, locked in a subtle dance across the sky and the valley.
</P>
<P>
   A patchwork of soft green spreads through the crisp, golden dead
grass of winter in yards and pastures.
</P>
<P>
   As early-morning fog blankets the valley, wisps of steam rise
from the fields and roads warmed by the sun the day before _ then
freeze into the delicate lacy glaze of hoarfrost on all they touch,
transforming the countryside.
</P>
<P>
   As black storm clouds roil over the Monument and cast shadowy
outlines of the cliffs behind gray curtains of rain, puffy white
clouds hide the rim of Grand Mesa with veils of falling snow.
</P>
<P>
   And so the two seasons struggle. Yet even as winter dusts the
valley with snow and sleet, crocuses and daffodils bravely blossom.
As a chilly March wind races through the bare bones of trees,
willow branches with budding leaves of kelly green and gold sway
with the breeze.
</P>
<P>
   As the weakening winter fades, spring grows stronger. The sun
shines more warmly, and the scent in the air changes from woodsmoke
and snow to a moist, earthy green aroma. The lilting songs of birds
fill the morning air. And, once again, spring reigns victorious.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, March.

   RUSSIA-COMMUNISTS _ TULA, Russia _ Despite the hype surrounding
Vladimir Putin, almost 50 percent of Russians are expected to vote
for other candidates in the upcoming presidential elections. Twelve
candidates are running in the race, and some of the strongest
opposition to Putin comes from the Communist Party rank-and-file
members, who disagree with Putin's views on relations with the
United States and on economic issues like land reform. In a
Communist bulwark town, regular Russians give their views about
politics and why they stand behind their man, candidate Gennady

Earth; the other the most populous. One is the richest nation in

   TECH-FUTURE _ LOS ANGELES _ Americans participated in two great
migrations in the 20th century. First, they moved by the millions
from farms to cities, seeking jobs, and after World War II, they
moved again, this time from central cities to suburbs. In the new
century, yet another demographic pattern may emerge: immigrants and
young people will leave suburbs everywhere to find work in the
nation's booming high-tech clusters. Certain states, including
California, Texas, New York, Florida and Georgia, will get a surge
of growth from Asians, Hispanics and others seeking jobs, while the

 &HT;    Sea of victims still adrift in flood-ravaged N.C.
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tick Bite, N.C. _ By the hardscrabble standards of eastern North
Carolina, Herman Edwards had a spacious home. An ironworker, he
welded two mobile homes together.
</P>
<P>
   But the 76-year-old retiree is now among tens of thousands of
flood victims whose lives are still dangling six months after
Hurricane Floyd ran ashore Sept. 16, 1999. They're grasping
desperately for whatever permanence they've got left after North
Carolina's most costly natural disaster flooded more than 60,000
homes _ leaving 24,000 destroyed or uninhabitable.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd has been costly for Edwards. In addition to his home,
which he is dismantling and turning into a storage building, he
owns four mobile homes. Before the storm, he rented them to tenants
for a combined $1,200 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards is now living temporarily in one of those trailers; the
others are vacant. All are in the flood zone of swampy Contentnea
Creek. Gone is the rental income, as well as the comfort of having
lived in the same place since 1966.
</P>
<P>
   ``It knocked the wind out of you,'' said Edwards, a big man with
a laugh as soft as his plaid flannel shirt. ``You walk out every
morning, and everything you worked all your life for is gone.''
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina's worst flooding is the new century's lingering
disaster, a nightmare for dozens of communities and towns where up
to 20 inches of rain swelled rivers, creeks and swamps beyond the
100-year and, in some cases, the 500-year flood plain.
</P>
<P>
   If the government succeeds in what would be the nation's biggest
buyout of disaster-stricken homes, 8,000 structures in the flood
plain would be demolished at a cost of $424 million. The people who
lived there would have to move elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Some municipalities are allowing people to return to their old
homes, despite the government's warning about future flooding.
Relief workers say some people, needing a place to sleep, are
slipping into abandoned homes at night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a prime example of survival,'' said Warren Moore, a human
services official with the North Carolina Division of Emergency
Management.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of Contentnea Creek from Tick Bite, in
Grifton, Police Chief Linwood Outlaw reports a rash of thefts from
vacant houses.
</P>
<P>
   The flooding turned Luke Miller, 83, into a rambling man. It
ruined his house in Grifton, 75 miles southeast of Raleigh, but
that doesn't stop him from sitting on the front porch. He wanders
down the street to the mobile home that his daughter arranged for
him.
</P>
<P>
   Unfolding a metal chair, he sits in front of the trailer,
drinking orange soda from a liter bottle, hoping the utility
company will hook up his electricity so he can move in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sit and look,'' said Miller, surrounded by trailers with
blown-out windows and their furnishings turned topsy-turvy and
crawling with mold. The breeze slaps a screen door open and shut in
this abandoned neighborhood, where patches of yellow daffodils mark
the lots where trailers were smashed and hauled away.
</P>
<P>
   ``These areas (that were) flooded are still ghost towns,'' said
Eric Tolbert, director of the Division of Emergency Management.
``There is a lot of work left to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   More than $4 billion in government and private disaster relief
is pouring into eastern North Carolina. Thousands of volunteers
from across America have trekked here to help rebuild homes. But
that enthusiasm is waning, along with the national publicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we talk to people outside of the area of devastation,
they have forgotten that there are people down here without
homes,'' said Billy Tarlton, 49. With his wife, Beadie, he runs the
North Carolina Baptist Men's home rebuilding effort in Grifton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people are still sleeping on floors, some outside,''
Tarlton said. ``They just don't have a place to go.''
</P>
<P>
   White and brown poster board covers the walls of the Tarltons'
office in Grifton's First Baptist Church. As victims apply for
assistance, their names are added to the wallboards, listing more
than 400 families seeking to have their homes rebuilt.
</P>
<P>
   In quick and sometimes painful fashion, the list sums up the
work to be done.
</P>
<P>
   ``238 Sheila Cannon. Tree crushed bathroom.''
</P>
<P>
   ``208 Glendale Holmes. Gut if rebuildable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``142 Mamie Edwards. Done moved in.''
</P>
<P>
   About 30 area homeowners have been paired with churches, which
typically send work crews on weekends. Volunteers from other
organizations are working on other houses. There aren't enough
workers to go around, here and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Displaced homeowners ``are really getting down and out,'' said
Tarlton, who figures to be in Grifton for another 12 to 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 2,000 families are living in government-provided travel
trailers and mobile homes across eastern North Carolina. Gradually,
the nine parks once packed with the trailers are thinning out as
occupants move back home. They live in the trailers as they repair
their houses.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Wallace, farmer Hogue Cavenaugh, 34, is living in a
cramped camper with his wife and three children. It's parked on the
family's property, where Cavenaugh is building a house in front of
the one ruined by 3 feet of water.
</P>
<P>
   The house is rising on 8-foot pilings, a precaution Cavenaugh
insisted on despite the added cost at a time when, he said, ``I've
run out of money.''
</P>
<P>
   He hopes to finish the house by year's end.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is home, and I don't want to move again,'' Cavenaugh
said. ``If the water comes back, it won't get me.''

 &HT;    Today's teens scaling down on auto horsepower, gearing up
accessories
 &HT;    By Jim DeBrosse
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KETTERING, Ohio _ A year ago, Fairmont High School senior Doug
Collins acquired a clean, hand-me-down '96 Sunfire from his mom,
but his automotive work in progress had just begun.
</P>
<P>
   Collins added ground effects, a ``slammed'' Euro-style
suspension, neon underlights, interior painting, 18-inch custom
wheels, an ear-pounding stereo system with Rockford amplifiers and
a cold-air intake to pump an extra 10-horsepower into his meager
2.2-liter engine.
</P>
<P>
   Total price tag for improvements? Around $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   And all that for a car hard-pressed to break a highway speed
limit until it hits fourth gear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't go for the speed aspect, I go for the looks,''
Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   Baby boomers who remember the days when hot teen-age cars packed
350-plus horsepower and macho nameplates such as Mustang, Barracuda
and GTO will be surprised at what passes for ``hot'' among today's
teens.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with exorbitant sticker prices and environmentally correct
engines, young car enthusiasts are buying econo-boxes such as
Neons, Escorts, Cavaliers and Civics, then jazzing up the
peripherals to turn them into lean, mean street machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``They look really cool, and they sound fast, but in a modern
car there's not a lot you can do'' to increase the horsepower, said
Larry Webster, technology editor of Car and Driver magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance rates have become a bummer, too. ``A lot of young
people like the Camaros, especially the Z-28,'' said David Martin,
a new-car salesman at Frank Z Chevrolet in Dayton. ``But they're a
higher-dollar car and the insurance is out of sight for somebody
under 25 if you have any kind of driving record at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Bowling, a senior at Fairmont High School, agreed. ``Big
engines are out. You get into trouble for them, man.'' Bowling
drives a '93 Beretta GT with a modest 3.1-liter engine.
</P>
<P>
   But Michael Garblik, professor of automotive technology at
Sinclair Community College, sees no reason to disregard the
performance of today's four-cylinder sport coupes. ``Sure, they
probably max out at 200 horsepower, but the cars are much lighter,
maybe 30 percent lighter (than the old muscle cars), so that a lot
of that disadvantage goes away. A highly tuned Honda would probably
run with some of those bigger engines.''
</P>
<P>
   On the East and West coasts, Webster said, Honda Civics have
become the car of choice for teens who want to supe up a smaller,
less expensive car.
</P>
<P>
   But in Dayton, with its strong GM influence and tradition, teens
are more likely to turn to Sunfires or Cavaliers for their basic
raw material. ``A lot of them have relatives who work at GM who can
help them out'' financially, Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodge Neon ES, with power windows and locks, is big among
young buyers, said Albert Murell of Dave Dennis Dodge in Fairborn.
``It's definitely about pricing. It's hard to get a new car under
$14,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the loose rumbling V-8s of old, today's higher-revving
four-cylinder engines are so efficient there's little that
teen-agers can do to squeeze out additional horsepower.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're already running around 80 horsepower per liter (of
engine displacement) from the factory, which is awesome,'' Webster
said.
</P>
<P>
   Many teens, including Collins, replace the air box with a
cold-air intake in the hope of adding power, ``but it's a tossup
whether it works or not,'' Webster said.
</P>
<P>
   Nitrous oxide systems can add as much as 100 horsepower to a
highly tuned, four-cylinder engine, but they can only be used for
short bursts of speed or they can damage the engine. And, by the
way, most of them are legal.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, so are most of the parts sold for modifying engines
these days, assuming teens can get them to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a whole new level of expertise'' to work on today's
computer-assisted engines, Webster said.
</P>
<P>
   With traditional hot cars such as Camaros, Firebirds and
Mustangs starting at $30,000 and up, up, up, male teens have had to
turn to other automotive outlets for their excess of testosterone,
and a big one has been trucks, Garblik said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody loves trucks,'' he said. ``They make up 50 percent
of the market nowadays, along with SUVs.''
</P>
<P>
   They can also attract attention from the opposite teen sex, says
Larry Baker, a 19-year-old Sinclair automotive student who plans to
drop a 351-cubic-inch V-8 into his 1985 Ford F250 pickup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say I get more dates, because I've been with the
same girl for three years now,'' he said. ``But it definitely turns
heads.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially since Baker jacked up the suspension and installed
40-inch Stahl tires for that fetching off-road racer look. And if
that doesn't get their attention, the headers and Corvette
sidepipes he added are loud enough to drown out even his Pioneer
sound system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's pretty cool, if you like that type of thing,''
said Baker's girlfriend, 19-year-old Jamie Honious of Miamisburg.
``Sometimes when he goes very fast, though, you can't hear yourself
think.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all teens are out to promenade their vehicles, but they are
looking for something peppy and affordable, says Sam Garten, a
salesman for Bob Tatone in Fairborn.
</P>
<P>
   Grand Ams and Escorts are hot sellers among the youth market, he
said. ``It's the lower-price two-doors they think are really cool _
something with slightly more horsepower than the usual
four-cylinder,'' he said. And selling for less than $14,000, he
added.
</P>
<P>
   The good news for teens who aren't automotive prodigies is that
automakers are again aiming a line of products at young buyers,
with new fuel-efficient but more stylish models that they can buy
without borrowing big bucks from Daddy, Webster said.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota introduced the Echo this year and Ford has its new Focus
_ both with advertising campaigns and sticker prices targeted at
the youth market.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to create brand loyalty from a teen's very first
car, Webster said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids of the baby boomers _ the `echo boomers' _ are an
even bigger population slice than the boomers were,'' he said. The
automakers ``are trying to get them in on the ground floor and keep
them in the fold.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if they can't lay a long patch of rubber down a back
country road, today's youth-oriented cars are safer and better
engineered than ever, Garblik said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can have great acceleration and handling and braking in
one car now,'' he said. ``It's a good time to be young and to like
cars.''

   BENSALEM, Pa. _ The first time the young heiress from
Rittenhouse Square made headlines was in 1889 when The Philadelphia
Public Ledger bannered: ``Miss Drexel Enters a Catholic Convent _
Gives Up Seven Million.''
</P>
<P>
   But Katharine Drexel, while embracing the vow of poverty, did
not quite give up the family fortune accumulated by her father,
Francis, a banking partner of J.P. Morgan's. Rather, she invested
it in two of the most abused groups in 19th-century America as she
dared to create a congregation of missionary nuns dedicated to
educating post-slavery blacks and American Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Her innovation was no less a sensation in its day than is the
latest Drexel headline, ``Pope Announces Sainthood for Champion of
Minorities,'' which is slowly sinking in here in this highway-laced
bedroom community north of Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican, having deemed two cures of gravely ill children
miraculous, has announced that the onetime socialite will indeed be
St. Katharine Drexel, as of October.
</P>
<P>
   Hotels have already begun calling the Sisters of the Blessed
Sacrament in anticipation of fresh waves of pilgrims to Blessed
Katharine's tomb here at the motherhouse. In preparation for the
modern ways of faith, the sisters have joined the Internet
(www.katharinedrexel.org) and are stocking the souvenir shop with
some of the most eclectic arrays of sacramentals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in awe,'' Mayor Joe DiGirolamo said at the very idea of
St. Katharine. He is busy designing new traffic controls even as he
makes plans to be in Rome for the canonization. He recalls the
saint from his boyhood as an eye-catching wisp of a matriarch late
in life, staring out from her wheelchair at the working-class
strivers of Bensalem.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the motherhouse, proud smiles abound. There are some
stunning recollections of Katharine Drexel, who was raised to see
the poor as individuals invited three times a week to her parents'
Philadelphia mansion for a discreet family dole.
</P>
<P>
   ``She'd be shocked at this,'' Sister Thomasita Daley said. A
lively octogenarian, Sister Thomasita dwelled on the founder's
humanity and determined humility _ plain qualities the sisters
acknowledge are at risk of being lost in the mist of hagiography
and the approaching busloads of tourists.
</P>
<P>
   For this reason, Sister Beatrice Jefferies, the order's vice
president, likes to hear the few surviving nuns who knew Mother
Katharine sit around and talk of her as a resourceful woman more
than a mesmerizing saint. ``We have to keep telling the stories,''
she emphasized.
</P>
<P>
   Sister Thomasita knew Mother Katharine as a spiritual role model
and hard-driving businesswoman often on the road but in the
background as she built the order into a formidable sisterhood of
500 women teaching in ghettoes and on Indian reservations in 21
states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, honey, we turned them out,'' Sister Thomasita said
proudly of the tens of thousands of graduates. Mother Katharine
predated the nation's civil rights struggle by 70 years, building
scores of schools and convents and a college for her needy
youngsters, Xavier College in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there would Mother Katharine be, patching her stockings in
the evening alongside the rest of us,'' said Sister Thomasita, who
was a novice when she met the durable founder, who died in 1955 at
the age of 96.
</P>
<P>
   Mother Katharine was a shrewd talent scout, sending recruiters
to the Catholic farm villages of Ireland and scooping up Inez
Carney 67 years ago in a group of 19 adventurous colleens from
County Mayo. ``I've had a great time,'' said Sister Inez, an elfin
nun, looking back at a career in which she amassed lifelong friends
as she taught in numerous Southern ghettoes and Western
reservations of the Apache, Navajo, Pueblo and Osage tribes.
</P>
<P>
   Sister Inez helped nurse Mother Katharine in her final years.
Rather than recalling saintly deeds, she remains impressed at how
the founder demanded all the homespun limits of poverty, down to a
severe wooden chair when she was infirm. ``She could have had a
grand big lounge chair!'' Sister Inez said. ``She could have had
anything,'' she said, touching once more on the riches-to-wimple
tale that first beguiled Americans over a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, that famous Drexel fortune, which amounted to $20
million across time, is gone now, the trust funds having reverted
to other family charities with the death of Mother Katharine.
``It's very difficult right now,'' admitted Sister Faith Okerson,
while hardly doubting the survival of an order that, like other
modern sisterhoods, has had its membership dwindle to half.
</P>
<P>
   Most painfully, the sisters recently had to close Mother
Katharine's very first mission, the 111-year-old St. Catherine's
school on the Pueblo reservation in Santa Fe, N.M. A tribal leader,
Joe Abeyta Sr., sorrowfully traveled here to pray and put sacred
corn pollen on Mother Katharine's crypt. The nuns recorded what he
prayed: ``Mother Katharine, you loved me, you came to my house. You
have taught us well and we are ready to lead.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Medicare officials have accused health maintenance
organizations of sending false information to their elderly
subscribers in an effort to mobilize them to pressure Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In response, federal officials have begun demanding that HMOs
submit newsletters and other documents to the government for review
before sending them to Medicare beneficiaries. In this way, the
government says, it will be able to ``correct any misstatements or
misleading information.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials said they could also impose civil fines and
other penalties on HMOs that send misinformation to beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   The health plans insist that they are only exercising their
right to communicate with their members on important public issues,
including recent cuts in Medicare benefits.
</P>
<P>
   But federal investigators say they have found evidence that HMOs
billed Medicare for some of their lobbying expenses. Federal
regulations generally prohibit government contractors from using
federal money for lobbying intended to influence Congress.
</P>
<P>
   HMOs say that some lobbying expenses may indeed have been
included with other administrative costs in the past. And they
insist that the practice was not forbidden by the Medicare law.
</P>
<P>
   A new study by the Health Care Financing Administration, which
runs Medicare, says HMOs have disseminated ``false and/or
misleading information'' that blames the agency for rising health
care costs, increased premiums and reductions in benefits.
</P>
<P>
   One HMO, run by Highmark Inc., a Blue Cross and Blue Shield plan
in Pennsylvania, told members that the Clinton administration was
cutting $11 billion from Medicare ``without approval from
Congress.'' It urged Medicare beneficiaries to send letters of
protest to Congress and the administration.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Dr. Robert A. Berenson, a senior Medicare
official in charge of the managed care program, said, ``We are very
concerned about health plans that have been misleading
beneficiaries and misrepresenting facts.''
</P>
<P>
   Berenson acknowledged that any restrictions on the free-speech
rights of HMOs could run afoul of the First Amendment. But in a
recent memorandum to the head of the Medicare agency, Berenson said
some restrictions were necessary because otherwise patients would
receive inaccurate information, and the agency would be ``unfairly
blamed for benefit cuts or premium increases.''
</P>
<P>
   Medicare officials considered issuing a regulation that would
flatly prohibit HMOs from using their members' names and addresses
for lobbying or political purposes.
</P>
<P>
   But, Berenson said, lawyers at the Department of Health and
Human Services have ``serious concerns about the statutory basis
for such a regulation,'' fearing that it could be challenged as
``an unconstitutional restriction on speech.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than ban such communications, federal officials said,
they will review them in advance to correct any inaccuracies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The threat of public criticism'' by the government will
probably be effective in getting HMOs to revise their
communications with beneficiaries, Berenson said in his memo. ``In
extreme situations,'' he said, the government can correct the
misinformation by writing directly to patients.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Berenson said that ``we would not engage in
prior restraint,'' but that HMOs would find it advisable to
cooperate with the government. ``You shouldn't hear a political
message in the midst of promotional material for the medical care
at a particular organization,'' Berenson said.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare provides health care to 39 million people who are
elderly or disabled. More than 6 million of them, about 16 percent
of all beneficiaries, are in HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   Karen M. Ignagni, president of the American Association of
Health Plans, the main lobby for the managed care industry, said,
``The Clinton administration is limiting our ability to communicate
with our members because it disagrees with our message.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, she said, federal officials have told some HMOs
that they cannot use their newsletters to inform Medicare
beneficiaries of a grass-roots coalition lobbying Congress for more
generous HMO payments and benefits. More than 80,000 elderly people
have joined the coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're merely imparting information to beneficiaries,'' Ignagni
said. ``They have a great deal at stake. They depend on us for
coverage of prescription drugs and other benefits not available in
the traditional Medicare program.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration and HMOs are theoretically partners
in the Medicare program, but their relations have deteriorated in
the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton contends that HMOs are overpaid by Medicare,
while the health plans contend they are paid too little to cover
the benefits they provide.
</P>
<P>
   Health plans have also clashed with Clinton over legislation
that would grant patients a wide range of new rights, including the
right to sue HMOs for injuries caused by negligent treatment or the
denial of care.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare payments to HMOs vary from county to county, and many
HMOs have pulled out of the Medicare program in counties where they
consider the payments inadequate. Many health plans that remain in
the program have cut benefits, including coverage of prescription
drugs, or increased the premiums and co-payments charged to
beneficiaries this year.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Weinstein, a spokesman for Highmark Inc., which operates
Keystone Health Plan West in Pennsylvania, said the company lost
$18 million on its Medicare HMO business in 1998 and lost $5
million to $10 million on the program in 1999. But, he said, the
company continues to operate the health plan for 145,000 Medicare
beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein defended the letters to beneficiaries in which
Highmark accused the Clinton administration of making ``arbitrary
cuts'' in Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a grass-roots communication with our members,''
Weinstein said. ``We felt it was important to do what we could to
preserve managed care as an option for the tens of thousands of
Medicare beneficiaries who want it.''
</P>
<P>
   Elderly people often join HMOs to obtain low-cost drug benefits,
and they lose such benefits if they return to the traditional
fee-for-service Medicare program. Insurance companies offer
supplemental insurance with drug benefits, but those Medigap
policies can be expensive, often costing more than $2,200 a year.
</P>
<P>
   June Gibbs Brown, inspector general of the Department of Health
and Human Services, said HMOs had billed Medicare for tens of
thousands of dollars in lobbying and political activities. Such
items were lumped together with other ``administrative costs''
reimbursed by Medicare, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Pete Stark, D-Calif., the ranking member of his party on
the Ways and Means Health Subcommittee, said: ``HMOs have been
lobbying Congress, spending millions of dollars against the
patients' bill of rights and seeking more money from Medicare. That
is their right.''
</P>
<P>
   But to pay for such activities, Stark said, ``HMOs should use
their profits, not the money that is supposed to go to
beneficiaries in medical care.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Millennium, schmillennium. It's the Year of the
Dragon, baby. And among Asian-Americans who abide by the Chinese
lunar calendar, this auspicious season of the mythical beast is
also turning out to be the year of the baby boom.
</P>
<P>
   Word to the nonlunar: the Year of the Golden Dragon, which began
Feb. 5 and ends next January, is regarded as an especially
propitious year to make business deals, buy property and have a
baby. It is believed that a child born under the sign of the
ferocious, fire-breathing creature _ as opposed to less
dignified-sounding signs, like, say, that of the rat (1996 being
its latest incarnation) _ will grow up to be a brave, powerful
leader. In Chinese tradition, the dragon is the symbol of royalty.
</P>
<P>
   So it is easy to understand why it already appears to be, well,
a rather productive year for baby-making among Asians who abide by
the lunar calendar _ in New York, they are mainly Chinese and
Koreans, but also smaller numbers of ethnic Chinese from places
like Vietnam and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
   In Chinatown and other heavily Asian neighborhoods like
Flushing, in Queens, health workers say they are already seeing
more and more broad-grinned, big-bellied mothers-to-be ambling into
clinics and hospitals for checkups and prenatal classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dragon's a lucky sign,'' said Judy Chen, a Flushing
resident who is expecting a baby this year. ``If you have a dragon
in your house, everything will go up. Maybe you'll have lots of
kids. Your family will get rich.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it is impossible to tell just how many new births
have been planned because of the dragon designation; the year 2000
has no doubt roused the reproductive proclivities of those who also
observe the lunar calendar.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the anecdotal evidence is hard to ignore. At the
Chinatown Health Clinic in Lower Manhattan, enrollment in prenatal
classes has gone up from an average of about 50 women a month to
about 80 since January. At the Chinatown clinic of St. Vincent's
Hospital and Medical Center, a social worker has seen her caseload
of pregnant women go up to about 50, from an average of 40 a month,
since January.
</P>
<P>
   At New York Hospital Medical Center in Flushing, an attending
physician in the department of obstetrics and gynecology said he
would not be surprised to see a 50 percent increase in births this
year. At Elmhurst Hospital Center, where more than a tenth of the
patients are Chinese or Korean, births in February alone _ babies
born at the head of the dragon, if you will _ have jumped by nearly
20 percent since February last year.
</P>
<P>
   An attending obstetrician at the hospital, Dr. Ing-Yann Jeng,
said he and other Queens doctors with a large number of Chinese
patients had anticipated the trend. ``We were joking last year _
after this year, we can all retire!'' Jeng said. ``The reason: this
is the year 2000 and also a dragon year.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the mothers-to-be, many of them have already started to
reap the benefits of an especially auspicious pregnancy. Li Fang
Huang, 33, said her husband, a restaurant worker who was more
enthusiastic than she was to have a baby this year (little wonder,
since she delivered a baby girl just last year) made this promise:
``He said he is going to work harder than before,'' she said,
grinning, as Brenda Wan, a health educator at the Chinatown Health
Clinic, translated from Cantonese.
</P>
<P>
   So, too, did Sherry Hu's husband. In the past, he spent a few
nights a week staying with his co-workers in New Jersey, where he
is a restaurant worker, instead of coming home to Bensonhurst,
Brooklyn. But ever since Hu, an immigrant from Fujian province in
China, got pregnant, her husband has been coming home every night,
she said. He even drove her to work every morning, until she gave
up her job at an insurance agency a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Wan explained this behavior: ``There is a Chinese saying _ I
don't know how to translate it exactly. Because of the baby, the
mother becomes very precious.''
</P>
<P>
   Hu, 31, the mother of an 8-year-old girl, waited until the
dragon came around to plan for her second child. ``Since last year,
I'm planning,'' she said. ``I have a lot of friends who have been
trying. It's very tough this year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Year of the Dragon, one of 12 zodiac signs in the Chinese
lunar calendar, comes once every 12 years. A baby born this year
``is endowed with this aura,'' explained Ho Yong, director of
curriculum at the China Institute, in Manhattan. While some people
believe that it is better to have a dragon boy, Yong said, a girl
is considered just as likely to inherit the dragon's sterling
attributes. ``A dragon daughter,'' he said, ``is a female child who
is powerful, who is outgoing.''
</P>
<P>
   By the way, if you're just getting hip to the lunar timetable,
time is running out. If you're not well on your way, there are
precious few weeks left to conceive a dragon baby.
</P>
<P>
   After several months of effort, Chen, 35, got news of her
pregnancy just last month. Her first child was born a year and a
half ago, in the Year of the Tiger, and she knows that when her
second comes along, she will have her hands full. ``If you have a
dragon and a tiger at home, they fight a lot,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. A child born under a lucky sign is believed to bring
good fortune to the entire household. And she should know. Chen, an
immigrant from Taiwan, was born in the Year of the Snake,
affectionately known as the little dragon. ``If you have a little
dragon in the house, it's better than nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the dragon baby that Nicole Tran is expecting in
August wasn't exactly planned. Nor is Tran, a Vietnamese immigrant
of Chinese heritage, a big believer of the zodiac. Sure, she feels
lucky. But the birth of her baby under such a rare and auspicious
sign is important for a very different reason. The baby's father,
to whom Tran is engaged, is not Chinese, and so for her, it is
particularly gratifying to be able to pass along such an important
Chinese symbol to their child.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me,'' she said, ``the dragon signifies being Chinese.''

   WEATHER CHANGE ADVISORY:
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times News Service is planning an expanded weather
package starting today. The package, consisting of a weather map as
a graphics file and a text file to accompany the map, is available
to graphics clients of the News Service.
</P>
<P>
   The new map grows to 4 columns in width (52 picas), from 3, and
is 6 inches deep; the old was 4 inches deep. This new size permits
the insertion of cloud cover information, previously a separate
map, and the addition of many new cities.
</P>
<P>
   The map is available both in color and in black and white.
Because the map is much more detailed, we have devised an entirely
new palette of colors to make it easier to read the added
information.
</P>
<P>
   A sample of the new map is available at Wieck, Newscom,
Presslink and AP's GraphicsNet.
</P>
<P>
   Some papers using the old map may need extra time to make the
transition to a 4-column format. We will, for a limited time,
produce a 3-col version of the new map, but with only some of the
new map's additional cities.

   BAND OF TOSSUP STATES MAY PICK THE WINNER
</P>
<P>
   Now that it is all but certain who the presidential nominees
will be this fall, the buzz is beginning about which states will
hold the key to victory.
</P>
<P>
   No one really knows the answer, of course, not this soon in the
game. But there is a rough early consensus among the pundits and
pros and it goes something like this:
</P>
<P>
   The Northeast and the West Coast are leaning Democratic and
likely will mostly end up in Vice President Al Gore's column.
</P>
<P>
   But the South, the High Plains and the Rockies are leaning
Republican and probably will end up mostly in Gov. George W. Bush's
column.
</P>
<P>
   That works out to an electoral vote wash _ thus far.
</P>
<P>
   So who gets to decide?
</P>
<P>
   If the talk means anything, keep an eye on an irregular band of
states, heavily industrialized, that stretches west from New Jersey
and Delaware into Pennsylvania and then on to Ohio, Michigan and
Missouri. Most of those states look like tossups.
</P>
<P>
   Then throw in a scattering of other states that also have a
tossup look, subject to plenty of argument and qualification.
</P>
<P>
   Among those states are Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine and
New Mexico, and possibly Georgia and Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   And do not forget Florida, Iowa, Tennessee and Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   Washington state and Iowa, and most especially Tennessee, should
be Gore country.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush pulled a big vote in the Iowa caucuses and the
Washington state and Tennessee primaries and there is some
speculation that he might be inclined to commit the resources to
try again in the general.
</P>
<P>
   As for Florida, with its big cache of electoral votes, it is
Bush country _ the governor is Jeb Bush _ but Gore has considerable
strength there and he might have even more should he pick the
state's popular senior senator, Bob Graham, as his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   For that matter, speaking of vice presidential choices, should
Bush pick Pennsylvania's well-regarded governor, Tom Ridge, as his
running mate, he might be able to tip that state into his column.
</P>
<P>
   Or should Bush try to grab New York by choosing Gov. George E.
Pataki?
</P>
<P>
   Or New Jersey by choosing Gov. Christie Whitman?
</P>
<P>
   This is a tricky game. Especially in the early innings.
</P>
<P>
   Place no bets.
</P>
<P>
   AD FOOTAGE RECYCLED: ONLY NAMES CHANGE
</P>
<P>
   Election 1998. Lewis Massey, Georgia's secretary of state, is a
candidate for governor, running an advertisement that shows a
teacher sitting at her desk as a long line of pupils rushes past,
faster and faster, each putting an apple on the desk until the pile
almost reaches the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   Massey, a Democrat, appears on screen, calling for more money
for education and lamenting:
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, Georgia classrooms have more kids and more kids and
more kids. As class sizes grow, it's hard for teachers to keep
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Cut to Election 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Easley, North Carolina's attorney general, is a candidate
for governor, running an advertisement in which a teacher is
sitting at her desk as a great long line of pupils rushes past,
faster and faster, each putting an apple on the desk ...
</P>
<P>
   Same teacher. Same children. Same apples.
</P>
<P>
   Now Easley, a Democrat, appears on-screen, calling for more
money for education and lamenting:
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, North Carolina classrooms have more kids and more kids
and more kids. As class sizes grow ...''
</P>
<P>
   What's going on here?
</P>
<P>
   Same consultant for both campaigns _ Saul Shorr of Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had access to footage that is effective,'' Amanda Crumley,
Easley's press secretary, explained the other day.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis Massey lost.
</P>
<P>
   A CAUTIONARY WORD ON BUSH'S COATTAILS
</P>
<P>
   Back in the days when George W. Bush had $70 million in campaign
funds in the bank and a double-digit lead over Al Gore in the
polls, many congressional Republicans, especially House members,
were gleeful about the prospect of riding the governor's coattails
to victory in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   But now Bush has spent most of that $70 million and, after a
bruising battle with Sen. John McCain of Arizona, the polls have
him running no better than even with Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Worried Republican leaders have begun warning candidates not to
depend too heavily on the governor's coattails in November,
especially candidates locked in tight races that could determine
whether the Republican Party keeps control of the House. In fact,
says Rep. J.C. Watts Jr. of Oklahoma, the chairman of the House
Republican Conference, a new party poll indicates that the governor
may no longer have any coattails at all.
</P>
<P>
   Watts, a solid Bush supporter, is keeping the exact poll numbers
to himself. But in an interview last week with Roll Call, a paper
that covers Capitol Hill, he was blunt about their portent. ``We
can't rely on the presidential nominee,'' he said. ``There's no
coattails at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   MAPPING A NEW ROUTE FOR A MCCAIN RUN
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jesse Ventura of Minnesota, the nation's most successful
third-party candidate, says that Sen. John McCain could win the
presidency if he would only take that route now. But Ventura
insists he is not pressuring McCain to bolt his party and go for it
this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Not so Doug Friedline and Dean Barkley, the political
masterminds of Ventura's surprising 1998 victory. Recently, they
have been on the phone numerous times to McCain's campaign manager,
Rick Davis, pushing him to push the senator toward a third-party
bid, but not under the banner of the Reform Party, which Ventura
has since bolted.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could win,'' Friedline said. ``But I'd steer him away from
the Reform Party, that mess.''
</P>
<P>
   The word coming back from McCain: He was, is and will remain a
faithful Republican.
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA CITY COUNCIL HAS A GAY MAJORITY
</P>
<P>
   Voters in Wilton Manors, Fla., made political history last
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   They installed a mayor who is gay, as well as two council
members, meaning that the city's five-member ruling body now has a
gay majority.
</P>
<P>
   The only other city in the nation where elected gays also are
running things is West Hollywood, Calif., said the Gay and Lesbian
Victory Fund, a political action committee based in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Wilton Manors, a community of about 12,000 just north of Fort
Lauderdale, has one of Florida's fastest-growing gay populations.  &QL;

FOR THE WORLD'S CHUDNEY GRAYS, ANOTHER STOP ON LIFE'S JOURNEY
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON, Ariz. _ There is a section in the St. John's men's
basketball media guide where each player discloses personal
information: hobbies, favorite movies, favorite foods.
</P>
<P>
   The entries are often funny _ Jack Wolfinger says one of his
superstitions is ``to listen to at least one Wu-Tang song before I
start my day'' _ though most of them seem as if they were hastily
put together. One more chore a student athlete has to perform.
</P>
<P>
   When you get to Chudney Gray's page, you get the sense of a
person who took the time to consider the content.
</P>
<P>
   Under the category: ``If you had three wishes'' Gray writes:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``I wish my mother was alive to see me graduate this year.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``I wish I could understand the things I don't already know.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``I wish I could help end poverty and homelessness.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of his biography in the guide Gray did something none
of his teammates did: he inserted an addendum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also would like to thank everyone that stood by me
throughout my four years, especially my father and grandparents.
It's been a great journey and, yes, I have many roads to travel. I
just hope to be successful and strong enough to face the different
obstacles of life. I love you `ma' and also the one that smiles in
her sleep. TR-1 Forever!! And just live life to its fullest.''
</P>
<P>
   Gray is a 6-foot-3 senior guard who has become a crucial member
of the St. John's team that plays with a seven-player rotation,
limited size and a lot of desire. Gray's role is to keep the desire
going.
</P>
<P>
   Last season St. John's reached the final eight with a team
anchored by Ron Artest, a multitalented forward who is starting for
the Chicago Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   This year's team lacks the extraordinary player and lacks depth
and size, but in some ways is more cohesive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're very good this year,'' Gray said. ``I even think
that we're even a little bit better because we know that we need
each other even more. When you have so many players that can do so
many things, they tend to take it upon themselves to try to win
games when you need everybody. That's one thing that we learned: We
need each other. No one single player on this team can actually
take over a game.''
</P>
<P>
   Gray's college basketball odyssey began in 1996 when he was
recruited to play for Manhattan College out of Rice High School by
Fran Fraschilla. When Fraschilla took the St. John's job before the
next season began, Gray, feeling that he could play at a top
Division I program, followed.
</P>
<P>
   Gray didn't enroll for the fall because he failed to get the
required SAT score. He didn't receive a qualifying test score until
October and was eligible in December. For two seasons Gray sat on
the bench. When Fraschilla was dismissed and replaced by Jarvis
last season, Gray began to prove himself.
</P>
<P>
   In midseason last year, he became the first substitute off the
bench. He responded with a career-high 15 points against
Pittsburgh. A game later he had nine points, two rebounds, two
assists and a steal in 20 minutes in a victory over West Virginia.
This season Gray has become a critical part of the St. John's team.
</P>
<P>
   Gray's crucial contribution this season began in December when
his friend and teammate Erick Barkley underwent knee surgery. Gray
made the first start of his career against Niagara and led St.
John's to an 81-66 victory. He contributed 14 points, seven assists
and a dynamic tomahawk dunk. After the game, Niagara coach Joe
Mihalich said: ``Gray was terrific. He kept the team together''
</P>
<P>
   Gray said, ``My role is to come in and give the guys energy and
just keep everybody together and just try to change the pace of the
game, or keep it on that high note.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Big East tournament Gray, had a big game in St. John's
75-70 quarterfinal victory over Villanova, and he scored 14 points
as St. John's defeated Miami in the semifinal game.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago this month Gray's mother died of leukemia. He and
his sister Tiffany were raised by his grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   Gray said that through all the sorrow and sadness he felt, his
mother's death helped sharpen his goals and establish priorities.
He wants to play some level of professional basketball without
forcing a career, without chasing one. Playing the role of the
point guard. Taking what's there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to waste four or five years,'' he said. ``I'm not
going to sit around and hope and pray and be sad and sulk and lie
to myself saying: `I'm going to go here. I'm going to do this,' and
having everybody pushing me when that's not really the reality of
things.''
</P>
<P>
   The great thing about the national college tournament is that
there are so many different dimensions in the diverse tapestry.
Large programs with multimillion dollar budgets; small programs
that run on a shoestring. The highly recruited can't-miss prospect.
The player who rarely gets off then bench.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the Chudney Grays of the world. The salt of the
earth type player who form the core of the student-athlete motif:
good, not great, a piece of the puzzle, not the puzzle itself. More
important, they have used sports to discover education and prepare
for success in a larger journey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gotten realistic,'' Gray said. ``I know that there's
something out there for me to do, either going back to school and
getting my master's degree or playing somewhere. I want to be
successful.''
</P>
<P>
   This tournament is hot and exciting. For players who have put
their eggs in one basket this is the defining moment of their
lives. For players like Chudney Gray, this is only a stop along the
way.

SPORTS COLUMN: LEARNING AT TEMPLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BUFFALO, N.Y. _ When John Chaney says he will do anything to
motivate a player, take him at his word.
</P>
<P>
   He has done a number of gross things as the basketball coach at
Temple, including trying to duke it out with John Calipari, then
coach of the University of Massachusetts, and calling players names
like ``Mr. Diaper'' _ and that's just what he does in public.
</P>
<P>
   This is how low Chaney sank in goading Juan ``Pepe'' Sanchez,
his current point guard who was recently selected as a third-team
all-American: Chaney learned to curse in Spanish. Or, rather,
Chaney thought he learned to curse in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   This excursion into linguistics took place during the first year
at Temple for Sanchez, who was recruited out of Bahia Blanca,
Argentina, on the basis of a five-minute tape.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know much English,'' Sanchez said the other day with
hardly a trace of accent. ``I could say `Hi' and `How are you?' and
`My name is,' and that was about it.''
</P>
<P>
   As the freshman point guard, Sanchez often ran out of control
and, back in those days, he even entertained the odd predilection
for tossing up a shot once in a while.
</P>
<P>
   To try to cure him of these expansive habits, Chaney would yell
at him in his own particular patois _ an unapologetic stream of
billingsgate far more creative than Marine drill instructors or
master rappers.
</P>
<P>
   Chaney was afraid, however, that he was not getting through to
the young man because of these transcultural misunderstandings. So
Chaney went to a friend and asked for a list of phrases that might
help bridge the gap between a gentle Argentine and a ferocious
down-home bootstrapper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nasty words,'' Chaney rasped, in a voice worn down by a
68-year diatribe against idiocies.
</P>
<P>
   There was one session when Chaney invited Sanchez to depart for
Bahia Blanca on the first plane out, as soon as the airport opened.
(Temple practices are held at 5 a.m., long before flights depart
for South America, or anywhere.)
</P>
<P>
   To cap off the invitation, Chaney added a few of the phrases on
his list. Nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``His Spanish was terrible,'' Sanchez recalled. ``I didn't
understand a word of it. I had to ask, `What is he saying?'''
</P>
<P>
   So Sanchez stayed around, and produced one of the truly unusual
statistics: Sanchez must be one of the very few college players
whose scoring average dropped three straight times from his
freshman season _ 10.0 in his freshman year, 9.6 as a sophomore,
8.2 as a junior and at the moment 5.8 for this season.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez has not scored a single point in the last two games, or
a field goal in three, yet he was the best player on the court
Friday night with 15 assists and three steals and only two
turnovers in a clinical 73-47 dismemberment of Lafayette, in the
first round of the national tournament. Sunday he will have more of
a challenge, matched against Seton Hall's point guard, Shaheen
Holloway.
</P>
<P>
   They are polar opposites, with Holloway finding creative ways
for everybody to score, most certainly including himself, and
Sanchez displaying a selfless array of soft passes. Bounce passes.
Tip passes. Blind passes. Laser passes against the zone.
</P>
<P>
   In these Iverson days, there are almost no point guards who pass
almost exclusively. Sanchez is a throwback to point guards of
nearly half a century ago, like Dick McGuire of the New York
Knickerbockers, who needed a full-throated chorus of ``shoot!''
from his teammates before he would attempt such a selfish act.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez says his role models are two former point guards on the
Argentine national team, Alberto Cabrera in the '60s and Miguel
Cortijo in the '80s, both of whom refrained from shooting whenever
possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad told me about them,'' Sanchez explained.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez was playing in high school in Bahia Blanca, a city of
250,000 and Argentina's main port, 400 miles south of Buenos Aires.
A neighbor had an uncle visiting from Philadelphia who encouraged
Sanchez to send a short tape of his games. Chaney, according to
legend, gave him a scholarship on the basis of Sanchez not taking a
single shot in five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw him run like a rabbit and throw passes off a dribble,
which is a lost art,'' Chaney whispered hoarsely the other night.
``I saw a lot of heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez did not arrive as a selfless player. He liked his
points, and he liked to drive aggressively to the basket. The loud
man at Temple ultimately cured him of that, as Chaney has cured
many others of their solipsistic tendencies.
</P>
<P>
   This is all part of the learning process. John Chaney ultimately
picked up a smattering of Spanish, and Pepe Sanchez learned from
the Chaney school of English as a Second Language. The National
Collegiate Athletic Association likes to somberly intone about its
wonderful ``scholar-athletes.'' Here is a case where learning
actually took place.

BRYANT TONES DOWN ACT TO WIN BIG
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rick Fox noticed something peculiar the past two months, the way
a teammate he used to think of as impetuous began to harness his
talent and conserve his flair. After watching for so long while
Kobe Bryant struggled to fold his game into his team's, Fox could
not believe how suddenly Bryant arrived at a crucial understanding:
that the needs of the Los Angeles Lakers outweighed his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to tell him the other day, `I'm proud of you, man,'''
Fox said. ```I'm really proud that you recognized a lot of our
success relies on your ability to remain calm and composed, to step
your game up when we need it.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he was going to be a few years away still, but it's
almost been overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   Some parallel. Bryant grows up as a player and the Lakers just
happen to become the very best of the NBA. It is no coincidence how
the evolution of a rising young supernova has mirrored the
incredible success of his and Shaquille O'Neal's team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're `the Combo,''' O'Neal said last week, coming up with a
nickname for himself and Bryant. ``One-two punch. If one of us
doesn't get you, the other will.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaq's force plus Kobe's flash have always equaled fear among
opponents. But this is different. ``What's happening now is
downright scary,'' said Jerry West, the Lakers' president and the
man responsible for pairing the two.
</P>
<P>
   Before their loss to Washington on Thursday night, the Lakers
had won 19 straight _ the third-best winning streak in league
annals. That followed a 16-game run between Dec. 11 and Jan. 12.
Their run has separated them from Portland and the class of the
Western Conference and made the Lakers the favorites to give Los
Angeles its first post-Magic championship.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a year on the job, coach Phil Jackson is folding his
arms in contentment, smiling that
my-guys-get-it-and-your-guys-don't smile that characterized his
six-title run with the Bulls. His new team is 53-12 and running
away with home-court advantage throughout the playoffs. As they
walk into Madison Square Garden Sunday for a high-noon NBC ratings
bonanza against the Knicks, their coach is the first to acknowledge
one of the primary reasons the Lakers are so good.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Kobe, the process has been: How do you meet your own goals
and desires while also escalating the play of your team and
including yourself in that group?'' Jackson said. ``He has met that
challenge. His development as a playmaker has been crucial.''
</P>
<P>
   Before their 19-game streak, Bryant was averaging 22.6 points
and 3.9 assists. During the run, his point production remained
steady while his assists jumped to 5.6. When he is feeling spry and
the Lakers need his offense, he still takes over on occasion _
witness the career-high 40 points he dropped on Sacramento last
Sunday as the Lakers erased a 16-point second-half deficit.
</P>
<P>
   But it is Bryant's quest to sacrifice his athleticism _ to save
his indefensible crossover and his lean-in windmill dunks for the
right moments _ that have impressed his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't take every situation as a personal challenge,''
said Fox, the reserve forward. ``He's so competitive that, when
challenged, he'll find a way to redeem himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``No longer is he taking it to a level that at times became
detrimental to the team. Flat-out, he's picking and choosing his
opportunities a lot better and making us more dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant said: ``It has to do with me figuring out what my
teammates want from me and where they were on the floor. I don't
feel like a completely different player, but I will say this: I've
been able to hold back a lot from my game.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if that pains a player with his skill level, Bryant
laughed and said: ``It's tough sometimes, because I know what I can
do. There's certain moments where I can do those things and it
actually benefits the team. Finding those moments now is the key.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been growing pains. During a lackluster victory over
Cleveland on Jan. 19, Jackson chastised Bryant during and after the
game for essentially thinking, ``Kobe first, Lakers second.''
O'Neal even voiced his displeasure in the locker room, saying,
``We've got to act like a team,'' a pointed reference to Bryant's
one-on-one forays.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Jackson held his first and only Lakers meditation
session, turning down the lights as the team searched for a sense
of self amid the occasional selfishness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phil doesn't mind getting on players, even star players,''
West said. ``I think that's helped. He will sit Kobe down if he
thinks he needs to. In watching Kobe play the last six weeks, he's
been phenomenal. His defensive play, the way he's settled in on
offense. It's just been great.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Despite his immense popularity outside the locker room, Bryant
is often described as a loner on the Lakers, a bit of an aloof
celebrity who almost levitates above the air his teammates breathe.
But then, he only turned 21 in August. As guard Derek Fisher said
last week, ``Kobe can finally go out with us now.''
</P>
<P>
   The winning has partly healed an old rift between he and O'Neal.
``Kobe understands, like we all do, Shaquille is the man on this
team,'' Fisher added. ``That took awhile. He has definitely
accepted the responsibility to be a better team player, to allow
his ability to fit in with everyone while also having the freedom
to dominate a game by himself sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant said, ``People will always throw stuff out there because
of barber-shop talk, but me and Shaq are cool. And me and Phil have
a good relationship, too. He has been great for us. He is a more of
a teacher than I ever imagined. He knows so much about basketball.
Personally, I think it's helped me as an individual.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers have more than merely Bryant to thank for their run.
O'Neal has been simply awesome, worthy of every corny nickname he
has ever bestowed on himself. The Diesel was named NBA player of
the week last Monday for the third time this season, averaging 43
points and 18 rebounds a game in three victories. After Vince
Carter dropped 51 points on Phoenix in his national television
debut two weeks ago, Shaq-Daddy had 61 points against the Clippers
on March 6 _ a display of dominance that brought both euphoria and
disbelief to the Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   By raising his free-throw percentage nearly 10 percentage points
during the 19-game streak, the Big Luggage has also made the
Hack-a-Shaq defense passe. You cannot simply foul O'Neal anymore
and expect him to miss.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran leadership has been key, too. Glen Rice has sacrificed
his game to accommodate the two young stars. The skills Robert
Horry once brought to the Houston Rockets have re-emerged in L.A.
He did nothing for Jackson to begin the season, but after
recovering from a broken nose has managed to secure the majority of
minutes at power forward.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Shaw, who used to click with O'Neal for alley-oop dunks in
Orlando, has again found his friend hovering above the rim. Like
Ron Harper, Horry and A.C. Green, Shaw still has something left in
his legs and understands the growth process in becoming an elite
team.
</P>
<P>
   These Lakers also stop people. They lead the league in opposing
field-goal percentage. Last season, opponents made 46 percent of
their shots against them. Today, teams barely shoot over 41 percent
against the Lakers. The wingspan on Bryant's 6-foot-8,
sinewy-yet-muscular frame made Allen Iverson an ineffective
perimeter player earlier this season.
</P>
<P>
   But Bryant's ability set up his teammates _ the ability to worry
about others before himself _ has been the genuine key. Whether
lobbing to O'Neal down low or recognizing a cutting teammate as the
double-team swarms him, Bryant is seeing the possibilities unfold
before acting rashly.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson used to rely on Harper, the former Bull, to settle
Bryant down and to organize the offense. Gradually, Bryant is
becoming the Lakers' primary playmaker. At one point during the
streak, he and his teammates were averaging five more assists a
game than their season average, contagiously sharing the basketball
because the player West refers to as ``best two-guard in the game''
has become so unselfish.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really has gone to a place where I didn't think he would be
for a few years,'' Fox said. ``His game has stepped up to a level
where you want the ball in his hands, running this team. You don't
even question it anymore. You know he's going to make the right
decision.''

SONNY HINE, 69, ADVENTUROUS HORSE TRAINER OF SKIP AWAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sonny Hine, who owned and trained Skip Away, the Horse of the
Year in 1998 and one of racing's stars of modern times, died Friday
at a hospital in Miami. He was 69.
</P>
<P>
   Hialeah racing officials reported that Hine died of
complications from pneumonia. He had been suffering from cancer
since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Sonny Hine led a life with adventurous twists that included two
years as a fingerprint specialist with the FBI and a stint as a
State Department investigator in Hong Kong during the Korean War.
He was fluent in the Mandarin dialect of Chinese, which he had
studied in an Air Force language school, enabling him to intercept
and translate messages.
</P>
<P>
   ``They needed someone with an investigative background who could
speak Chinese,'' Hine said. ``I was very reluctant to go, but the
money was good.''
</P>
<P>
   But the abiding passion of his career was the horses he trained,
and none stood higher than Skip Away, who was nominally owned by
Hine's wife of 37 years, Carolyn, who accompanied him regularly on
their racing travels. The gray colt earned $9.6 million, second
only to the $10 million won by his great rival, Cigar.
</P>
<P>
   In the Jockey Club Gold Cup in 1996, Skip Away defeated Cigar
and came back to win the race again the next year, starting a
nine-race winning streak that ended when he ran third in the Gold
Cup in 1998. Along the way, he also won the Pimlico Special,
Hollywood Gold Cup, Woodward Stakes and Donn Handicap.
</P>
<P>
   In the second start of his winning streak, Skip Away was entered
in the Breeders' Cup Classic after Hine paid $480,000 as a
supplemental fee because the horse had not been nominated. It was a
significant gamble, but Skip Away redeemed his owner's faith by
winning the Classic by six lengths in record time of 1:59.
</P>
<P>
   But despite his durability and dramatic performances, Skip Away
ran second to Cigar in the voting for Horse of the Year and again
ran second in 1997, that time to the juvenile star Favorite Trick.
</P>
<P>
   He won the title Horse of the Year in 1998 at the age of 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``He won nine in a row, including seven Grade I's,'' Hine said
with some bitterness after Skip Away was finally honored. ``He
stayed in training for months on end. What more could he do?''
</P>
<P>
   And Carolyn Hine, who considered Skip Away a member of the
family, said with feeling: ``If he hadn't won, I would have been
numb. This horse deserves all the accolades.''
</P>
<P>
   Hubert ``Sonny'' Hine was born in New York City, but was
intrigued with horses at a young age. He and his brother Marvin
rode horses in match races at fairground meetings and, Hine
remembered: ``My father trained horses, but he had to make a living
doing other things. Training horses was his dream, and I guess
that's where I got my interest.''
</P>
<P>
   The night he graduated from high school, Sonny Hine hitchhiked
to Charles Town race track in West Virginia and, he said, ``I've
been on and off the race track ever since.''
</P>
<P>
   He saddled his first winner, Economy, at Marlboro Race Course in
1948 but then interrupted his career to work for his friend J.
Edgar Hoover, director of the FBI. He left the bureau in 1950 and,
four years later, went to work for the State Department in Hong
Kong. Between jobs, he attended college, served in the Air Force
and kept his hand in the training of horses.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Skip Away, he trained Technology; Norquestor;
Dawn Quixote; Amber Pass; Best Bet; Cojak; Guilty Conscience, the
champion sprinter of 1981; and Skip Trial, the sire of Skip Away. &QL;

NICOLAS H. WALTER, 65, FEISTY ATHEIST AND ANARCHIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nicolas Hardy Walter, a one-time choirboy who became an
influential and indefatigable anarchist, atheist and humanist, died
March 7 in Milton Keynes in central England. He was 65.
</P>
<P>
   Walter, who lived in London, died of long-dormant testicular
cancer, which he developed in 1973. Often arrested as he
demonstrated in his wheelchair, he publicly blamed the high doses
of radiation he received for the cancer for paralyzing him below
the waist. But in a 1994 interview with The Independent, a London
newspaper, he said he did not consider suing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should I?'' he asked. ``If I sued for negligence and won,
it would mean there was less money for other people.''
</P>
<P>
   Walter, who called himself a journalist and lecturer, lived his
life at the barricades, fighting against nuclear weapons, the
Vietnam War and what he perceived as the hypocrisy of organized
religion. Arrested many times for demonstrating his beliefs, he
once went to jail. He fired off fusillades of letters to editors,
and estimated that 2,000 had been published. At the time of his
final illness, he staged a sit-in at the hospital to demand
admission.
</P>
<P>
   A fierce opponent of British involvement in Northern Ireland, he
once harbored a deserter from the British army in his home. In
1963, he was a member of a group called Spies for Peace, which
stole and publicized the plans of the British government to
continue governing the country in the event of nuclear war.
</P>
<P>
   One of Walter's grandfathers was an anarchist, the other a
leading figure in the humanist movement. His father, William Grey
Walter, a neurophysiologist, was also an atheist and a socialist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nicolas was glad to have descended from this fine tradition of
free thinkers,'' his daughter Natasha wrote in an obituary in The
Independent.
</P>
<P>
   Other survivors are his wife Christine Morris, daughter Susannah
and three grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   After serving in the Royal Air Force, he studied at Exeter
College at Oxford University where he was a member of the Labor
Party. His idealism was pure and strident. ``In the '60s,'' he
said, ``I did think everything could be changed for the better.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, he interrupted a church service in Brighton where Prime
Minister Harold Wilson was speaking and received a two-month jail
sentence. The next year, he wrote a pamphlet entitled ``About
Anarchism,'' a clear and incisive introduction to the subject,
which was translated into a dozen languages. In it, he argued that
ends not only do not justify means, but that ``the means are ends
in most cases.''
</P>
<P>
   He advised, ``We can be sure of our own actions, but not of the
consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   He wrote for mainstream publications including The London Review
of Books and The New Statesman, as well as for more ideological
publications like Freedom and Solidarity. He was also a staff
writer for The Good Food Guide, worked as a press aide for the
British Standards Institution and served for six years as an editor
of The Times Literary Supplement. He did commentaries for radio and
television programs, and his obituaries for a variety of newspapers
won respect for their grace and completeness.
</P>
<P>
   His books included ``Nonviolent Resistance: Men Against War,''
published in 1963; ``Blasphemy Ancient and Modern,'' 1990, and
``Humanism: What's in the Word,'' 1997.
</P>
<P>
   From 1975 until his retirement last year, Walter worked for the
Rational Press Association, first as editor of its publication, The
New Humanist, and later as managing director. He continued to write
and comment on the issues of the day, winning praise for his
austere style and attention to detail.
</P>
<P>
   His letters to editors persistently demonstrated his independent
spirit. In one to The Guardian, he argued that he would be glad to
lose his own government allowance as a paraplegic, but only in
exchange for proper access to streets and buildings, transport and
entertainment, shops and restaurants, he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to The Independent, he took issue with a writer who
had suggested that ``no sensible atheist will reject the
possibility that an intelligence directs the universe.''
</P>
<P>
   He replied, ``On the contrary, a sensible atheist may well
reject the possibilities either that an intelligence on its own can
direct anything, or that anything can direct anything.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last years of his life, he wrote several letters about
the millennium, proposing that counting time backward to Christ's
birth is inconvenient, at best. But he was willing to let the
silliness pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all, we are humans as well as humanists,'' he wrote,
``and we agree with the rest of humanity that even a nonsensical
excuse for a party makes sense.''

 &HT;    Officers vow to find former Black Panther
 &HT;    By Lyda Longa
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Hundreds of police officers and FBI agents continued
to search Friday evening for a former Black Panther turned
neighborhood leader who is wanted in the killing of one Fulton
County sheriff's deputy and the wounding of another.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they believe Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin, formerly known
as H. Rap Brown, is being harbored by someone who admires him for
his efforts to rid the southwest Atlanta enclave known as the West
End of drugs and prostitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will leave no stone unturned until we find this man,'' said
Capt. David Chadd, chief spokesman for the Fulton County Sheriff's
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Bill Campbell urged anyone with information that would
help police find Al-Amin to come forward. He warned that harboring
a fugitive charged with murder is illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Chadd said a 100-officer team searching West End for Al-Amin
early Friday morning was scaled back only after police determined
he was no longer within a four-block area near the Atlanta
University Center.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta homicide investigators and uniformed officers from the
precinct that covers that section of the city remained in the
neighborhood, however. That force was quadrupled after Deputy
Richard Kinchen, 35, died of multiple gunshot wounds Friday
afternoon at Grady Memorial Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   An all-points bulletin was issued before dawn advising that
Al-Amin could be driving a black, four-door Mercedes-Benz with
tinted windows and license plate 246MBG or a green Toyota
Four-Runner with Alabama plates 45AV431.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI issued a federal fugitive warrant for Al-Amin's arrest,
said spokeswoman Celeste Armstead.
</P>
<P>
   Aldranon English, 28, the deputy who survived the attack,
identified Al-Amin as the shooter after Atlanta homicide
investigators showed him several pictures from a lineup as the
officer lay in his hospital bed Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours later, English learned that his friend and partner
had died.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are heartbroken,'' said a solemn Sheriff Jackie Barrett.
``The entire department is taking this very hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said Al-Amin used a .223-caliber assault rifle to
attack Kinchen and English. The weapon is similar to M-16 and AR-15
rifles. The bullets are about 3 inches long and about a half-inch
in diameter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only purpose to use a weapon like the one he used is to
kill,'' Chadd said, referring to the weapon used in the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Kinchen, a nine-year veteran of the Fulton Sheriff's Department,
leaves behind a wife and two children.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deputy's demise was due to the horrendous trauma he
suffered from the attack with the assault weapon,'' Chadd said.
``His heart stopped several times, and he could not be revived.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a shame he had to die in such a heinous fashion,
especially since the deputies were only trying to serve him with a
warrant that was so minor.''
</P>
<P>
   Kinchen and English were attempting to serve a warrant on
Al-Amin late Thursday night for nearby Cobb County police.
</P>
<P>
   The warrant, issued Jan. 28 after Al-Amin failed to appear in
court, was for driving without proof of insurance and impersonating
a police officer. Thursday night, Atlanta police and Fulton County
sheriff's officials mistakenly said the warrant was for aggravated
assault.
</P>
<P>
   Police had arrested Al-Amin on May 31, 1999. He was driving a
stolen 1992 green Ford Explorer. He told the officer he had bought
the Explorer earlier in the month, according to the police incident
report.
</P>
<P>
   When Al-Amin pulled out his wallet, he had what appeared to be a
police badge, the report said. When the officer asked if he was a
cop, Al-Amin said yes, he was an officer in White Hall, Ala., the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Amin's run-in with the police would lead to tragic
circumstances nine months later.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Police Chief Beverly Harvard said the Fulton deputies
arrived at the rear of a grocery store Al-Amin has operated just
after 10 p.m. Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   When the deputies did not see Al-Amin inside, they went to the
front of the building. There they spotted a man beside a black
Mercedes-Benz, Harvard said. When the deputies approached him, the
man started shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The deputies shot back.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett said the shooter continued to fire at English as he
writhed on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only word I can use for this attack is `ambush,''' Barrett
said Friday morning at a press conference. ``There is just no other
word I can use.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Kinchen and English wore protective vests, the gear was
no match for the powerful bullets that struck the deputies, said
Dr. Jeff Salomone, surgeon for the Atlanta Police Department.
Salomone, associate professor of surgery at Emory School of
Medicine, said the slugs went under and around the vests.
</P>
<P>
   ``A vest offers no protection against a high-velocity bullet,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett said another surgeon at Grady told her that the wounds
sustained by the deputies ``looked like those seen in Vietnam.''
</P>
<P>
   The gunman was also injured. Harvard said investigators
searching for him followed a trail of blood that led to an
abandoned house near the scene. No one was inside. The Mercedes
that was parked in front of the store was gone.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Amin, 56, moved to West End in 1976 after he was released
from prison on a robbery conviction.
</P>
<P>
   He converted to the Muslim faith while in prison and changed his
name to Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin.
</P>
<P>
   His grocery store is about 100 feet from a blue frame building
that serves as a mosque.
</P>
<P>
   While Al-Amin has been well regarded in his community, Atlanta
police Detective Joseph Masterson Jr. said he was one of several
suspects in 20 unsolved West End homicides. But Al-Amin was never
charged. Deputy Chief C.B. Jackson and other police commanders
concluded they did not have enough evidence against him or other
suspects.
</P>
<P>
   The Muslim community, which has worked to revitalize West End,
showed support for Al-Amin after learning he is suspected of
killing the deputy.
</P>
<P>
   Nadim Ali, a spokesman for the Community Mosque of Atlanta,
urged caution and fairness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We the members of the Community Mosque of Atlanta would like
to state that the legal principle that a person is innocent until
proven guilty is also a concept that is consistent with the Islamic
belief. We ask you to avoid passing judgment until all the facts
are in and not use the media to accuse, try and convict Imam Jamil
Abdullah Al-Amin.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a respected leader in the Islamic community and his
works are well documented, not only in Atlanta, but throughout the
Islamic world.''
</P>
<P>
   Ali refused to answer questions from reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Bruce Harvey, who once represented Al-Amin, was
surprised to hear the allegations. In 1995, Harvey represented
Al-Amin when he was charged with weapons violations and aggravated
assault. He was accused of shooting a man in the leg in West End
Park. The charges were dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd put down the shotgun and picked up the Koran,'' Harvey
said. ``He's turned away from being a revolutionary and a radical
leader to being a spiritual leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why he would respond to these kinds of charges out of Cobb
County in that fashion would be unfathomable to me.''

IN INDIA, A HIGH PRICE FOR SUCCESS

 Robert D. Kaplan, a senior fellow at the New America Foundation, is
the author of ``The Coming Anarchy: Shattering the Dreams of the
Post-Cold War.'' 
 By ROBERT D. KAPLAN    
 c.2000 New York Times    
<TEXT>
<P>
   President Clinton's trip to South Asia is being viewed in terms
of a stark contrast: He is visiting India to pay homage to a rising
economic and nuclear power, and he will make a token stop in
Pakistan to urge restraint and democracy on a military regime
struggling to keep the nation from disintegrating.
</P>
<P>
   But the situation in both countries is far more complex. Indeed,
the nuclear arms race in the subcontinent and the sporadic fighting
in Kashmir are symptoms of how state authority itself is under
siege in both countries.
</P>
<P>
   On an economist's chart, India is a success story, with millions
of new wage earners and a middle class numbering up to 180 million,
depending on one's definition of ``middle class.'' But India may
not be a rising power at all: its state authority is simply
weakening at a slower pace, and in more nuanced ways, than
Pakistan's. The paradox is that the fraying of the Indian
government is driven not by social and economic failure, but by
social and economic dynamism.
</P>
<P>
   While in absolute terms India's middle class has grown, in
relative terms it really hasn't. The overwhelming majority of
India's billion-plus population is still backbreakingly poor. India
is increasingly less an exotic canvas of rustic villages populated
by subsistence farmers with little hope for a better lot in life
than an industrial and post-industrial dynamo with tens of millions
of migrants flooding into polluted, grimy factory encampments. When
these workers take on low-wage jobs, new ambitions and resentments
come to the fore.
</P>
<P>
   As these workers migrate and come into contact with different
ethnic groups and social classes, they are assaulted by the
temptations of the pseudo-western city _ luxury cars, night clubs,
gangs, pornographic movies. Moreover, their lives are plagued by
frequent electricity blackouts, shortages of safe drinking water
and poor handling of sewage.
</P>
<P>
   Thus while Westerners romanticize globalization and nouveau
riche entrepreneurs, they slight another pivotal, globalized class
of the post-Cold-War world: a growing, industrialized
subproletariat that surrounds the great cities not only of India
but also of China, Brazil, Indonesia, Pakistan and other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever language they speak, whatever their skin color or
religion, these new inhabitants of the Third World city have
similar desires. Many resent the distant national governments that
cannot provide them with basic necessities. They are creating new
political communities, including religious and ethnic ones. It is
notable that the Hindu extremists in India who burned down mosques
in the early 1990s and attacked Christians in the late 1990s were
for the most part clad in cheap western-style polyester outfits
rather than traditional clothes, and came from the working quarters
of India's industrialized landscape rather than from its villages.
</P>
<P>
   While the vibrancy and flexibility of India's democracy have
been duly celebrated in the West, the thuggery and ballot-rigging
that goes on in local elections throughout this new India, along
with the rise of regional and sectarian parties at the expense of
secular and national ones, are not taken seriously enough. Even as
governing authority is weakened by change, the Hindu nationalist
government now in power reflects the severe religious ideologies of
an angry working class.
</P>
<P>
   India, though never truly stable or tightly controlled to begin
with, is becoming increasingly an assemblage of region-states,
city-states and tribal entities. Fortunately, this change is
occurring slowly enough to avoid cataclysm. But when there is a
state in the southwest like Kerala, with literacy and birthrates
nearly at First World levels, and a state like Bihar in the
northeast, which is as poor and dysfunctional as anyplace in the
Third World, then the very notion of India as a single entity
becomes all the more disputable.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign policy may be the medium through which the Indian
government can most easily assert primacy. As India's governing
complexities mount, ``the bomb'' and the perceived willingness to
use it loom brighter as a totem of state legitimacy: ``Because we
have the bomb, we are an advanced and unified state _ not merely a
culturally rich and dynamic civilization!'' (A similar scenario
holds for China, where the expansion of the subproletariat and the
government's trouble exerting control in too many places at once
are going hand-in-hand with belligerence toward Taiwan.)
</P>
<P>
   Thus the argument of recent weeks that Clinton's trip should be
used to convince India that it, as the stable and growing power in
the region, should take the initiative in calming relations with
its crumbling neighbor Pakistan misses the point. It is the
challenge of modernity itself that is making India so bellicose.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to play down the crisis in Pakistan. Whereas India's
democratic system has at least earned legitimacy through longevity,
Pakistan's history is littered with the wreckage of military
regimes and ill-fated democratic experiments. While India's
religious and ethnic divisions are subtle, complex and not prone to
territorial solutions _ Hindus, Muslims and others are sufficiently
dispersed to make secession impractical _ Pakistan is somewhat more
easily divided: Sindhis in the south, Punjabis in the northeast,
Baluchis in the southwest, Pathans in the northwest. More
significant, anarchy in Afghanistan has destabilized Pakistan
through the flow of drugs and weapons across the border.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan's democratic leaders in the 1990s _ feudal lords more
than real politicians _ destroyed the fabric of civil society.
There is no going back to that system, at least not in the
immediate future. On the other hand, its military and intelligence
community is compromised by extremist elements that, among other
things, provide support for Islamic holy warriors fighting India in
Kashmir. Americans delude themselves if they think the choice is
between democracy and dictatorship in Pakistan. For the moment, the
choice is between Gen. Pervez Musharraf's relatively benign and
tenuous dictatorship and some theocratic nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   The last thing Musharraf needs is a lecture about swiftly
holding elections. It took decades before Mustafa Kemal Ataturk's
military rule in Turkey provided the institutional base for
successful democratic experimentation, and Pakistan today is as
complex and unstable as Ataturk's Turkey. Because Pakistan's regime
is so precarious, its reliance on the prestige of nuclear weapons
is as great, if not greater, than India's.
</P>
<P>
   These two countries are prime examples of the transition many
nations in the developing world are undergoing as they become more
fractured and urbanized, and poorer in basic resources. Some
states, here and there, will unravel. We can live with that. What
we cannot live with are large failed states with nuclear weapons.
Therefore, the last thing we should want are weak populist regimes
_ democratic or not _ that may act on impulse to legitimize
themselves.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Lawyers for three men charged in the 1998 African
embassy bombings are arguing for their clients' lives on political
grounds, contending that executing them would be a foreign-policy
disaster for the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In a memorandum that is being sent to Attorney General Janet
Reno, the defense lawyers contend that executions of their clients,
who are accused of being mere ``foot soldiers'' in a terrorist
conspiracy, would only turn them into Islamic martyrs while
creating a blood feud between the United States and the Muslim
world.
</P>
<P>
   The effect, the lawyers say, would be to seriously damage the
government's chances of prosecuting Osama bin Laden, the wealthy
Saudi exile who has been accused of leading a global terrorist
conspiracy that included the embassy attacks and other acts of
violence against Americans abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently worried that the issue may be viewed too narrowly,
the lawyers have also taken the unusual step of circulating their
30-page document to top officials in the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it plain,'' the Feb. 7 memo declares, ``that the
State Department ought to be fully consulted, and its views
considered, on all of the grave foreign policy, national security
and human rights implications of a U.S. government request for the
death penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   All three men have pleaded not guilty and plan to fight the
charges in court later this year. But the memorandum assumes for
the sake of argument that they have been convicted and that the
death penalty would be inappropriate. Such arguments to prosecutors
are routine in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   But lawyers in the case, U.S. vs. bin Laden, are seeking a much
broader audience in the government for their concerns about their
clients' fates.
</P>
<P>
   The case is the first in which federal prosecutors have sought
to impose the death penalty against a defendant accused of
terrorism in a foreign country. It is also the first time the
government has begun to pursue the death penalty in the series of
major terrorism prosecutions of about two dozen Islamic militants
in New York that began with the 1993 World Trade Center bombing.
Among those cases is another plot to blow up major landmarks in New
York City.
</P>
<P>
   One defense lawyer who has read the memo said: ``This case lies
at the intersection of the criminal justice system and foreign
policy. The whole point of the memo is that it is folly to simply
treat this as a mere criminal case, much as we might wish things
were so simple.''
</P>
<P>
   The defense decided last week to send the memo after the U.S.
attorney, Mary Jo White, indicated that she would seek the death
penalty for at least one of the defendants, Mohamed Rashed Daoud
al-'Owhali, and was still considering doing so against two other
defendants. Reno must approve all decisions to seek the death
penalty in federal cases.
</P>
<P>
   The bombings at Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania,
killed more than 200 people and wounded thousands. Mr. al-'Owhali
is one of two men in custody accused of playing a direct role in
the Nairobi bombing.
</P>
<P>
   A copy of the memo, which was submitted by nine lawyers
representing the three defendants who could face capital
punishment, was provided to The New York Times by a person who has
read it and believes that the death penalty issue should be debated
in a broader forum.
</P>
<P>
   The memo makes the defense strategy clear: to catch the
attention of top national security advisers to President Clinton
and to cast the death penalty issue not in legal terms but in a
larger context of the government's stand against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   The memo notes, for example, that if prosecutors seek to execute
al-'Owhali and his two co-defendants, Mohammed Saddiq Odeh and
Khalfan Khamis Mohamed, it would be the clearest signal that bin
Laden would also face execution were he ever brought to New York,
tried, and convicted.
</P>
<P>
   The government could hardly spare the leader of the conspiracy
if it planned to execute his lower level ``foot soldiers,'' the
memo asserts.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden remains at large, living in Afghanistan under the
protection of the fundamentalist Taliban, and the United States has
conducted sensitive negotiations with other Muslim countries in
hopes of having him arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, if the world knew bin Laden could receive a ``lethal
injection at USP Terre Haute'' _ the federal execution facility in
Indiana _ that would certainly chill any chance of cooperation from
Muslim countries, ``who must respond to domestic public sentiment
against handing over a Muslim leader to a Western power,'' the memo
says. But if bin Laden is not captured or is spared execution as
part of a deal with another country for his extradition, it would
be all the more unfair to execute his lower-level operatives, the
memo says.
</P>
<P>
   Already, three other defendants in the case face charges that do
not carry the death penalty, even though they are charged with
playing more important roles in the organization that conspired to
carry out the bombings. The U.S. government said it would not seek
the death penalty against one of them to win his extradition from
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   If higher-ups are convicted, the memo says, they will be immune
from capital punishment. Likewise, it says, if al-'Owhali and his
two co-defendants are sent to prison for life, they too ``will
vanish from view and soon be forgotten. But a sentence of death
will rescue them from oblivion,'' the memo says, ``and transform
them into celebrated martyrs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The very fact that the United States will have designated
these defendants for execution,'' it goes on, ``will guarantee that
their pictures will be held aloft over crowds of protesters. Babies
will be named for them, and young men from Morocco to Pakistan will
make plans to emulate them. Their actual executions will ignite
outrage and protest in many Muslim countries, and will leave a
legacy of further violence and revenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Placing bin Laden on death row would have enormous ramifications
for the United States, the memo says. In the World Trade Center
case, it notes, the defendants did not face capital charges because
their crime occurred before the 1994 death penalty law was passed.
An attempt to arrest bin Laden and imprison him for life, the memo
contends, will be seen as a credible punishment, ``because it
displays the self-restraint and moderation of a great nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if the United States declares that its success in this
effort will be measured by its ability to kill bin Laden once he
has been taken prisoner and rendered harmless,'' the memo says,
``the story line will quickly shift in a direction that could do
considerable harm to long-term American interests.''
</P>
<P>
   The defense lawyers have made separate submissions tailored to
each man's personal circumstances, offering arguments of why the
death penalty is not appropriate. Those documents are not being
circulated outside the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   But the lawyers argue in their policy memo that the death
penalty decision is too big to be left solely to Reno. The memo
asks her, in making the ``momentous decision,'' to involve ``those
agencies which do possess genuine expertise and experience in how
the actions of U.S. courts may affect American policy interests
around the world.''

<P>
   Experts who were interviewed last week agreed that the case
posed troubling and even unprecedented questions. ``I think
Washington is attempting to treat these cases as criminal, and, in
one sense, the rationale is not bad,'' said Graham E. Fuller, a
former vice chairman of the National Intelligence Council at the
Central Intelligence Agency, who is writing a book on the future of
Islamic movements around the world. ``They are trying to say, look,
we have nothing against Islam. This has only to do with criminal
activity, period.''
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other hand, by treating it purely as a criminal case,''
Fuller said, ``they may be falling into the trap of saying there
are no political ramifications.''
</P>
<P>
   Philip B. Heymann, a former deputy attorney general under Reno
and author of ``Terrorism and America'' (M.I.T. Press, 1998), said
the death penalty was probably being seen as appropriate for the
case because of the sheer number of deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the death penalty is going to be used in any case,''
Heymann said, ``it's hard to fail to use it in a case with 200
deaths.''
</P>
<P>
   In their memo, the lawyers argue that retribution would not
justify the death penalty. They say they went to Kenya and
interviewed the blast's survivors, who said they wanted those
responsible arrested and brought to justice, ``but we met no one
who wanted to see them executed,'' the lawyers say.
</P>
<P>
   They also argue that deterrence is also not a valid
consideration for these defendants. They note that the government
has accused al-'Owhali, for example, with being a would-be suicide
bomber.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indeed, given the centrality of the concept of martyrdom in
extremist Islamic political movements,'' the memo says, ``a
stronger case could be made for the counterdeterrent effect of the
death penalty _ that is, that the death penalty would actually
stimulate rather than deter similar crimes in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``The death penalty is simply not what they fear,'' the memo
adds.
</P>
<P>
   Because court-ordered executions can take years to carry out,
the memo likens Reno's decision to ``a cruise missile with a six-,
eight- or ten-year trajectory.'' By that time, the political
terrain may be totally different, the memo says, and ``it may be
self-evident that executing three Islamist prisoners under the
glare of world attention is exactly the wrong thing for the United
States to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The memo cites the Turkish government's struggles over whether
to carry out the death sentence of Abdullah Ocalan, the most
prominent Kurdish rebel. Under pressure from European leaders,
Turkey has delayed his execution.
</P>
<P>
   The case ``ought to stand as a warning about how easily in
political cases a death sentence can entrap the government that
imposes it,'' the memo says.
</P>
<P>
   It also notes that the Allied powers did not execute the ``rank
and file SS officers who ran the German concentration camps, but
reserved the death penalty for the very highest-ranking civilian
and military officials who conceived and directed this vast
criminal undertaking.''
</P>
<P>
   In perhaps its most chilling section, the memo describes bin
Laden's being convicted in the United States and sentenced to die.
The memo says he would likely present a ``dignified and charismatic
figure'' in the courtroom, and ``his denials of legal
responsibility for the Africa bombings will be credited by millions
throughout the world, to whom he will appear as a martyr for Islam.
</P>
<P>
   ``His sentencing hearing will provide him with a forum for
denouncing U.S. policies in the Muslim world,'' the memo continues,
``and to identify U.S. military actions which have undeniably
produced unintended collateral harm to civilian populations far
greater than even the Nairobi embassy bombing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The propaganda value of this opportunity for bin Laden and his
terrorist organization would be immense,'' the memo notes, ``and
the psychological impact of such a dramatic and highly personal
confrontation between the soon-to-be martyred bin Laden and the
United States government might well reverberate throughout the
Muslim world for decades to come.''

SPORTS COLUMN: A DISTURBING DOUBLE STANDARD 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A recent story that came across the wire began with the news
that although Pedro Astacio still faces a trial on domestic
violence charges, he is scheduled to be on the mound for the
Colorado Rockies when they open the season in Atlanta on April 3.
</P>
<P>
   What a relief for the Rockies and their fans that their 17-game
winner from last season will be available to start the season, and
will be playing at least through July 5, when he faces possible
deportation to the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
   On the same day Astacio pitches for the Rockies, absent from the
same ballpark will be John Rocker, beginning his 14-day suspension
for his off-season remarks about various ethnic groups and gays.
Astacio, meanwhile, is free to pitch, even though he had once
admitted guilt _ a plea that was withdrawn last week _ to hitting
his estranged and pregnant wife in August.
</P>
<P>
   The point is that for months after Astacio received a two-year
deferred sentence in exchange for a guilty plea on charges of
third-degree assault, Commissioner Bud Selig had nothing to say
about the quick-fisted pitcher. He had no fine to impose, no
discipline to mete out, no standard to uphold and no integrity of
the game to protect.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Selig the righteous has been all over Darryl
Strawberry for abusing himself with drugs, and on top of Rocker for
insulting so many, while injuring nobody.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally, when a crime is part of it, we let the criminal
procedure take place without interfering,'' said Richard Levin of
the commissioner's office. ``Then we may or may not take action.''
</P>
<P>
   That sounds fair and just, except that Astacio had already, in
effect, admitted to hitting Ana Astacio in the right eye in an
argument at the home they had shared until the couple separated in
June. The police report noted that Ana Astacio had swelling and a
red mark on her face.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, immigrants convicted of domestic violence _
felony or misdemeanor _ are subject to deportation. When the U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization Service initiated proceedings,
Astacio sought to withdraw his plea. In Littleton, Colo., last
week, a county judge allowed him to, on the grounds that Astacio's
lawyers did not adequately inform him of the consequences of his
plea.
</P>
<P>
   An INS district director, Joe Greene, said, ``Our efforts to
seek his deportation are suspended until the courts have spoken.''
He explained the attempt by adding that ``the message should be
that no matter what your station in life or public visibility,
you're not above the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Compared with the Rocker ruckus, this story has not been so much
as a footnote. Should we be surprised? This winter, an athlete who
has been accused of murdering his pregnant girlfriend (Rae Carruth,
formerly of the Carolina Panthers) caused less of a national uproar
than the lunkhead left-hander who sounds like a rebroadcast of
Howard Stern's show every time he opens his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker got a standing ovation last week when he pitched in his
first spring training game, which only proves that wrestling fans
go to baseball games. In other and more significant news, the
National Football League suspended three players for two games
apiece, the first time it has sidelined a first-time offender for
off-the-field violence under the league's violent-crime policy.
</P>
<P>
   One of the players, Denard Walker of the Tennessee Titans, was
cited after pleading guilty to assault on the mother of his son.
While this is no earth-shattering development against the alarming
trend of athletes who physically abuse women, it is a good start,
and at least the NFL has a policy.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball has none, said Levin, though he correctly pointed out
that baseball's off-the-field violence _ at least those cases we
find out about _ has not been close to the plague on football.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Selig's aggressiveness with Rocker and his silence on
Astacio opens a window into baseball's soul. Rocker created a
celebrity scandal, a media event, the South's most disparaging
mouth vs. the country's most diverse market. Something had to be
done. The image of the game had to be saved. The notion of
ballplayers as role models for children had to be preserved. But
when Astacio beats on a pregnant woman, baseball is happy to let
the courts handle it, in the hope that some judge or jury will
finesse the case and the only remaining blemish will be the one on
Ana Astacio's face.
</P>
<P>
   The double standards are as depressing as the way we react to
them, and report them. While we were consumed with Rocker,
analyzing his words as if they were preceded by thought, an Arizona
relief pitcher named Bobby Chouinard is being accused of choking
and slapping his wife on Christmas for refusing to buy him more
beer. When that did not persuade her, his wife told the police that
he held a loaded pistol to her head and made her beg for her life.
</P>
<P>
   Chouinard, facing five to 15 years if convicted, asked to be put
on waivers by the Diamondbacks so he could work on ``difficult and
regrettable problems.'' This relieved baseball, for the time being,
of any obligation to suspend him. Selig's inaction on the Astacio
case suggests that Chouinard may have, no pun intended, jumped the
gun.

GIULIANI AND CLINTON PURSUE DIFFERENT ROADS TO SENATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: This story is running on Page One in city editions.) 
(mk) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the six weeks since Hillary Rodham Clinton
announced her candidacy for the U.S. Senate, she has delivered a
stream of policy addresses that have begun to sketch out the
ideological foundation for her campaign. She has given a score of
newspaper and television interviews and traveled across New York
state, staging campaign events day after day.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's style could hardly be more different from that of her
opponent, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. The mayor, a Republican, has yet
to deliver a full speech discussing what he might do in the Senate.
While he holds regular freewheeling news conferences on the daily
happenings in his city, he has thus far declined most in-depth
interviews on the subject of his Senate candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   His campaign trips have been irregular, as his aides
acknowledged on Friday in announcing that he would travel upstate
this weekend for a day and a half, his longest venture so far on
the campaign trail. Giuliani has not even staged the formal
announcement that most candidates welcome as a high-profile
opportunity to make the case for their candidacy. Giuliani's aides
say that he most likely never will.
</P>
<P>
   This is a matter of design, and not happenstance. In the weeks
since Clinton announced her candidacy, leaving almost no doubt
about the makeup of the field, she and Giuliani have chosen starkly
different roads to the Senate. And that has become increasingly
clear through their actions _ or the lack thereof.
</P>
<P>
   For Clinton, it is the more traditional campaign of speeches,
events staged to highlight popular issues (education one day,
health care the next), and, of course, parades, like the St.
Patrick's Day parade in Manhattan, in which she marched to a good
bit of booing on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Giuliani's advisers have concluded that the best
way for him to run for senator is to be the mayor. That means, at
least for now, eschewing policy speeches and lengthy interviews
devoted to the subject of his candidacy, and spending far less time
on the campaign trail than his opponent.
</P>
<P>
   While Giuliani attacks Clinton frequently, it is typically over
tangential subjects, like her failure to tip a waitress during an
upstate campaign swing, rather than any policy differences between
them. The attacks are intended to rattle Clinton, one of Giuliani's
advisers said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Giuliani has resisted engaging Clinton on issues she
has raised and has typically declined to respond to her attacks.
When Clinton criticized Giuliani's education record last weekend,
the mayor's campaign responded with an attack on her campaign fund
raising. If there is any recurring theme for Giuliani, it is
reminding voters that Clinton is not from New York.
</P>
<P>
   This pattern could change, advisers to Giuliani and Clinton say,
but probably not any time soon. More important, they don't want it
to.
</P>
<P>
   Given the enormous skepticism about Clinton's character and
experience that exists among many New Yorkers, the methodical style
she embraces is arguably the only one available to her. Clinton's
advisers have concluded that if the campaign becomes a referendum
on the first lady _ about her years in Washington, her relationship
with her husband, her recent move to New York _ she almost surely
will lose. She is on much stronger ground, her advisers believe (as
do Giuliani's aides), if the election revolves around the question
of how the candidates might vote and conduct themselves in the U.S.
Senate, which accounts for how she has spent these last six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's style reflects a whole different set of calculations.
The most obvious one is the advantage he presumably enjoys as a
Republican mayor in a Democratic city. Being seen every day as an
effective mayor helps him not only in New York City, which normally
provides the geographical base for a Democratic candidate for
statewide office, but also in the suburbs, where voters generally
get their news from New York City-based television stations.
</P>
<P>
   There are less obvious reasons as well. Giuliani, as even his
closest supporters acknowledge, has a blunt personality that may
not wear well over time. That is particularly dangerous for him
upstate, where there is already evidence of hesitancy to embrace
this brash symbol of New York City. There is reason for him to keep
something of a low profile.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor is, of course, prone to the unconsidered campaign
utterance; one prominent Democrat supporting Clinton said that the
best thing Giuliani's advisers could do to ensure his election
would be to wrap a handkerchief around his mouth. And why, as one
of Giuliani's advisers said, should he get out there and run
against Clinton when on so many days she seems to be doing such a
good job running against herself?
</P>
<P>
   Then, too, New York is a Democratic state. It is not in
Giuliani's interest, except in the broadest sense, to get drawn
into a partisan discussion about the Democratic and Republican
views of issues that might arise in the Senate in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   There are some risks to both strategies. Clinton's restrained
speeches can certainly get lost in the glare of Giuliani's
fireworks. Clinton also does not have the obvious advantages on
issues that Sen. Charles Schumer enjoyed in defeating Alfonse
D'Amato in 1998: Both current candidates support abortion rights,
gay rights and gun control, for example.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the stance that Giuliani has adopted so far
allows the perception that he is running either an ideologically
slight or overly negative campaign. The latest New York Times/CBS
News poll found that a majority of voters believed that Giuliani
was spending more time attacking than explaining. An implicit
calculation in Clinton's plodding schedule of daily policy speeches
is that voters will ultimately turn away from a candidate who runs
a race like that.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Giuliani's approach reflects his essential calculation
that voters want the same qualities in a senator that they do in a
mayor. Clinton, as she tries to turn the discussion away from City
Hall and to Washington, is betting that they do not. In the end,
that might prove to be the key question in determining what happens
in November.

 &HT;    Death is hitting co-workers hard
 &HT;    By Alfred Charles and Ernie Suggs
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It has been 41 years since a Fulton County sheriff's
deputy was shot and killed in the line of duty.
</P>
<P>
   But on Friday the department struggled to cope with the shooting
death of Deputy Ricky Kinchen and the wounding of his partner,
Deputy Aldranon English.
</P>
<P>
   ``My worst fear has come true,'' said Maj. Michael J. Cooke, who
supervised the warrant deputies. ``I have never had to deal with
this.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time a Fulton sheriff's deputy was shot and killed in
the line of duty was 1959. An inmate wrestled a gun away from a
deputy in the county jail.
</P>
<P>
   Co-workers praised the work of both men shot Thursday, described
as hard workers who loved their jobs. Although the men had other
partners while serving warrants, their superiors said they often
rode together during their 4 p.m. to midnight shift.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say anything about those two other than to say they
were both outstanding,'' said Sgt. Clarence Huber. ``In all the
years I have known them, they have been great.''
</P>
<P>
   The mood was solemn Friday at Grady Memorial Hospital, where
both men were taken for treatment. At least 40 deputies, Sheriff's
Department administrators and Atlanta police officers gathered
outside the seventh-floor rooms where the men were being treated.
</P>
<P>
   Kinchen's wife sat on the steps outside Grady and wept
uncontrollably, consoled by a Fulton marshal. She declined to speak
to a reporter about her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Kinchen, 35, suffered gunshot wounds to his abdomen, said Dr.
Jeffrey Salomone, one of the Grady surgeons who treated the
victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kinchen is a very good officer,'' Cooke said before news of
the deputy's death. ``He has street instincts and is never one to
shy away from anything if necessary. He just did what he was asked
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Kinchen lost an enormous amount of blood and needed a
transfusion of about 50 units. Kinchen was pronounced dead around
3:30 p.m. Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Kinchen had been a deputy for nine years. He was a Florida
native who had served time in the Army. He was the father of two
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a quiet guy with a dry sense of humor,'' Cooke said.
``He didn't say much in roll call. ''
</P>
<P>
   Fulton County Marshal Capt. Philip Pickett was stunned when he
heard that Kinchen had died.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't prepare for something like that,'' Pickett said.
``You never know what is going to happen. There was nothing wrong
with their tactics.''
</P>
<P>
   Pickett said that he trained both Kinchen and English in the
Fulton County Public Safety Training Center and they often assisted
each other on issuing warrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was someone you liked to have around to have your back.
Every time something like this happens, you lose part of your
family,'' Pickett said. ``Officers fight sometimes, but we always
stick together.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff Jackie Barrett said English managed to signal for help
with his flashlight after he had been shot and lay on the ground
bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did well in a tough situation,'' Barrett said. ``I'm very
proud he maintained his composure.''
</P>
<P>
   English, 28, has been with the Sheriff's Department for four
years. He joined the warrant division after stints with the
sheriff's juvenile division and executive team.
</P>
<P>
   An Alabama native, he is a former Marine who has a wife and
three children, the Sheriff's Department said.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors said English was shot several times in both legs, his
left arm and his right chest wall. He was in serious condition
Friday, but doing well. Those who spoke to English said he was
alert but somber. English's family declined through a hospital
spokeswoman to talk to the news media.
</P>
<P>
   The flag outside the County Government Building has been lowered
to half-staff. Inside the building, 146 pints of blood collected
Friday during a blood drive scheduled weeks ago was donated to
Grady in honor of Kinchen and English.

 &HT;    TAIWAN ELECTS PRO-INDEPENDENCE PRESIDENT IN FACE OF BEIJING
THREATS
 &HT;    (1000&AMP;ADD)

<P>
   TAIPEI _ The people of Taiwan spoke loudly and clearly against
corruption and Chinese intimidation Saturday, kicking out the
ruling party after more than 50 years of political domination and
electing Chen Shui-bian, a former Taipei mayor and lawyer for
political dissidents, as president.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the opposition Democratic Progressive Party
triumph, the margin was larger than what most people expected and
what months of neck-and-neck polling suggested: Chen got 39 percent
of the vote; independent James Soong 37 percent; and Vice President
Lien Chan of the ruling Nationalist Party had just 23 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Voters were swayed neither by repeated warnings from Lien that a
victory by Chen, whose party calls for formal independence for
Taiwan, could lead to war with China, nor by a recent speech of
Chinese premier Zhu Rongji reiterating Beijing's willingness to use
force to prevent Taiwan independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to thank Zhu Rongji for helping us elect Chen
Shui-bian,'' said a Taipei accountant surnamed He, shouting above
the din of fireworks, air horns and general merriment of tens of
thousands of Taipei residents who turned out at Chen's campaign
headquarters to celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome was also an unmistakable message to the Nationalist
Party that voters see it as corrupt and tied too closely with mafia
elements. Both Chen and Soong campaigned as clean-government
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``(With a) 39% vote for Chen and 37% vote for independent James
Soong, the 'throw the rascals out' message was the clearest message
from this vote,'' said John Tkacik(CQ), a former U.S. diplomat who
now publishes a weekly business bulletin on Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   As for China, he said it may now be forced to re-evaluate its
Taiwan policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Politburo moderates in Beijing are now telling the
hard-liners, 'See! I told you the heavy-handed bullying would only
blow up in our faces. The time has come to completely revise our
approach to Taiwan,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The two governments have been estranged since the Nationalists
lost a civil war to Mao Zedong's communist party in 1949 and fled
to Taiwan. Reunifying Taiwan with the mainland is one of Beijing's
top priorities.
</P>
<P>
   As the campaign progressed, Chen backed down from his party's
independence platform, sounding more like his opponents in pledging
to negotiate with China and not make any drastic changes in policy.
</P>
<P>
   In his victory speech Saturday, he said he wanted to make a
``journey of reconciliation'' to China before his inauguration. He
also invited Chinese president Jiang Zemin and Premier Zhu to visit
Taiwan. Yet he added that Taiwan's sovereignty would be eternal and
Taiwan would never become a second Hong Kong, which reverted to
Chinese rule in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Chen also proposed a ``peace agreement'' and ``military
confidence-building'' measures, but did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued by state-run news media, the Chinese
government reacted cautiously, saying it would wait and see what
Chen would say and do. The election results ``will not change the
status of Taiwan as a part of China,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, President Bill Clinton congratulated Chen on his
victory and said the United States ``strongly supports'' dialogue
between China and Taiwan ``and is committed to promoting peace,
stability and prosperity in the region.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the election provides a fresh opportunity for both
sides to reach out and resolve their differences peacefully through
dialogue,'' he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue to conduct close unofficial ties with the
people on Taiwan through the American Institute in Taiwan in
accordance with the Taiwan Relations Act and our one-China
policy,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Chen and his party have been criticized for their lack of
experience in the foreign policy arena, having never held
national-level office.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may not have high-level credibility to conduct his mainland
policy,'' said Szu-yin Ho, professor of political science at
National Chengchi University in Taipei. ``China will probably not
give Chen any benefit of the doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   His supporters counter that he is better positioned to negotiate
with China because people in Taiwan will not second-guess his
motives, just as Richard Nixon, a fierce anti-communist, was able
to establish relations with China 28 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, Soong supporters are troubled by the thought of a Chen
Shui-bian presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very worried about relations across the Taiwan Straits,''
said Susan Chang, 28. ``We don't want to underestimate the military
power of China.''
</P>
<P>
   She is also pessimistic about the economic effects of Chen's
victory. At her job at a Taipei bank, she saw long lines of people
converting their money to U.S. dollars or transferring it out of
the country this past week. They were motivated first by a 6.6
percent drop in Taiwan's stock market Monday _ its largest
single-day decline ever _ and then by Zhu's fiery speech on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   David Yu, chairman of Summit National Bank in Atlanta, said he
knows of one bank branch in San Francisco that received $20 million
in transfers from Taiwan in the last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   After 51 years in power, the Nationalist Party has accumulated
massive riches and become entrenched not only in Taiwan's political
institutions but its financial ones as well. Political and economic
uncertainty are bound to ensue with Chen's victory, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I anticipate some chaos and confusion in Taiwan,'' Joseph Wu,
deputy director of the Institute of International Relations in
Taipei, said earlier this week. ``It would be the first time we
have a president who doesn't have a majority in the (parliament).''
</P>
<P>
   The Nationalists' huge defeat perhaps could have been foreseen
given a clear downward trend in the last 10 years in its share of
parliament and county-level seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the long run, the KMT is bound to be in trouble,'' Wu said.
``In the major urban areas, the KMT is starting to lose its grip.
This is an alarming sign.''
</P>
<P>
   Polls have shown that the Nationalist Party's strongest base of
support is in rural areas, among less-educated voters and older
voters. The opposition party is most popular among voters under 40
and the highly-educated.
</P>
<P>
   His head down, Lien said quietly in his concession speech that
he would engage in ``self-examination and self-criticism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you're going to see the disintegration of the party,''
said Yawei Liu, a Chinese native and history professor at Georgia
Perimeter College who has been in Taiwan for the past week to
observe the elections unofficially for the Carter Center.
</P>
<P>
   People have already been talking about Soong forming a new
party, which he hinted at in his concession speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of KMT members will quit and join Soong,'' said
Liu.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Chen, the other big winner in this election was
democracy itself, observers said. After Taiwan lifted 38 years of
martial law just 13 years ago, political reforms followed quickly,
with its first full parliamentary elections in 1992, its first
direct presidential election in 1996, and now, the first-ever
peaceful transition of power.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably unprecedented in the whole of Chinese
civilization _ one power replaced by another without bloodletting,
and all of the people accepting it,'' said Liu.
</P>
<P>
   The Taiwanese people themselves were enthusiastic about the
opportunity they had to influence their destiny. The voter turnout
rate was roughly 83 percent, which surpassed the already-high 74
percent turnout rate of the last presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Shin Chang, a Taiwan native who has lived in the United States
for 35 years, has been working since the 1980s for human rights and
democracy in Taiwan. He, along with more than 2,000 Chen supporters
from the U.S., returned to Taiwan this week to vote for their man.
</P>
<P>
   Chen's victory is ``the biggest fulfillment of my life,'' said
Chang, who retired last week after 25 years working in research and
development for Atlanta-based Coca-Cola Co. ``This is what I have
hoped for for a long time . . . the democratization of Taiwan.''

LAKERS TURN IN BOOK REPORTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal was given a book written by the German
philosopher Friedrich W. Nietzsche. Derek Fisher found the writings
of Chinua Achebe in his locker one day and re-read a book from his
youth called ``Things Fall Apart.''
</P>
<P>
   Kobe Bryant's literary gift from Phil Jackson?
</P>
<P>
   ``The White Boy Shuffle'' by Paul Beatty, the story of a black
child who grew up in a white community having to deal with the
cultural dichotomy of going back to his roots.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a little hip-hop and I thought very typical of Kobe's
life,'' Jackson said. ``He grew up in Italy and Europe for part of
his life and came back here. I felt it was appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Jerry West has joined Phil's Book Club. Jackson gave the
Lakers' president a copy of ``Confederates in the Attic,'' a
frightening expose on bigoted Southerners who still subscribe to
the beliefs of their Civil War ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just being around him, he's one of the real bright guys we
have in the league,'' West said. ``I have a different belief system
than him, but he's been able to incorporate some things that have
really helped us grow.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson made a mark in Chicago by combining standard coaching
philosophy with his beliefs in Zen and other forms of spirituality.
But it was an open question how O'Neal and his teammates would deal
with incense and candles in their lockers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're beginning to get the indoctrination, some of the
community things that I've always felt were important for a team to
grow and develop bonds together,'' Jackson said. ``Beyond the
basketball, I've always tried to make the experience worthwhile.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant enjoyed and appreciated his book. Given the provocative
content, though, he thought Jackson assumed a bit too much about
his upbringing so early in their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal said of Nietzsche: ``He was ahead of his time. Everybody
else was analog and Nietzsche was digital. They perceived him to be
crazy. So they put him in an asylum, which is how I'll probably end
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher's book, ``Things Fall Apart,'' is about a child growing
up in Africa who encounters major obstacles in his tribal setting.
Convinced he is destined to live a hard life, he stays the course
and things end up working out for the best.
</P>
<P>
   ``His message to all of us in different ways has been, `There's
so much more we can accomplish,''' Rick Fox. ``Phil brought that to
Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, Jackson's philosophy has achieved the impossible:
mellowing West, whose penchant for taking the game home with him
has often tested him physically.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say he's not made me as crazy and enabled me to relax a
little more during games I guess is true,'' West said. ``I think
it's because I watch him and he doesn't seem like he feels the
pressure of the game. Phil has such an unusual ability to laugh at
things, whether we're behind or tied. That to me expresses the
confidence he has. I think it does help relax the players.''
</P>
<P>
   Their egos have run up against each other on occasion. Jackson
pushed for the acquisition of Toni Kukoc before the trading
deadline, but West held firm and decided to keep Glen Rice at least
until the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The two men once competed against each other on the floor in the
1970s: Jackson, the mustachioed Knick hippie, and West, the
clean-shaven, homespun Laker, Zeke from Cabin Creek. To this day,
they have few things in common. But one thing they do share is a
fierce desire to win, and that has softened any potential rough
spots in their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear I wanted to have my hand on the throttle when I
first came in, to have a little more control,'' Jackson said. ``And
yet this team has convinced me that I can let go sometimes, the way
they've come back from second-half deficits and found ways to get
back in games and perform.''
</P>
<P>
   Of West he added: ``He's a very personable guy. Working with him
has been fine.''
</P>
<P>
   West said: ``These games torment me because I know there's a
certain way to play the game. It's the ultimate team game when you
do what you're supposed to. So it's a sense of comfort to say that
I don't worry about every game like I once did. I still don't take
anything for granted, but I'm much happier about things now. It all
started when we hired Phil. I can't give him enough credit.''
</P>

<P>
   Microphone Issue Lingers
</P>
<P>
   Michael Goldberg, the Manhattan lawyer who serves as the
executive director of the National Basketball Coaches Association,
was instrumental last week in helping the league and its coaches
come to a resolution over the microphone controversy.
</P>
<P>
   After much debate, the league backed off its mandate to put
mikes on unwilling coaches on the sideline during nationally
televised games. The compromise involved the coaches allowing a
boom mike to be used over their huddles during timeouts.
</P>
<P>
   But the issue still won't go away.
</P>
<P>
   A union official who declined to speak for attribution, said the
players association was not happy about the most recent
development. The union felt as if the coaches recouped some of
their own privacy at the expense of the players _ who can be more
clearly heard with the boom mike during timeouts. The players feel
as if they have been left out of the negotiations, that the matter
has essentially been put to bed because the coaches have been
satiated.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, Goldberg appears to have a conflict of interest on
his hands. Though he represents the coaches, his company, National
Media Group, also counts on the NBA for part of its livelihood.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1997 Sports Sponsor Factbook, the sports marketing and
consulting firm trumpets the NBA as one of its most significant
clients.
</P>
<P>
   The coaches do not have a union and are regarded as separate
employees of their respective teams. Goldberg said most of his
company's NBA business is related to the marketing and sponsorship
surrounding the coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not beholden to the NBA for anything,'' Goldberg said.
``My first loyalty is to the coaches.''
</P>
<P>
   But records show that the group is responsible for Schick's and
IBM's sponsorship deals with the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg said ``we're not totally on the same page'' with the
players association because of the players' union status. But he
added: ``I've been in contact with the players association on a
number of occasions on this issue. They know: I work for the
coaches. I've been doing it for 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   League officials plan to meet with the coaches after the season
to address their marketing needs, Goldberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue is by no means dead, but we're working toward a
resolution,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Warriors No More
</P>
<P>
   John Starks, a former Golden State Warrior, is sitting at home
in Tulsa, Okla., awaiting the outcome of an arbitration hearing
Tuesday to determine whether he can leave the Bulls permanently and
become a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Cummings recently suffered a partly torn rotator cuff in
his right shoulder and is expected to miss the rest of Golden
State's forgettable season.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Mills? He will also not play again this year after having
surgery Dec. 29 to remove bone spurs from his right ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen months after trading away Latrell Sprewell to the
Knicks, the Warriors do not have a single player left on the court
from that deal. Turning down a benevolent offer from Pat Riley of
P.J. Brown and Dan Majerle at one juncture, the Warriors basically
gave up one of the top swingmen in the game for three role players
who have no current role with the team.
</P>
<P>
   No one believed Golden State would get fair market value for
Sprewell, given the choking incident in December 1997. But how the
Warriors ultimately received so little in return is just another
example of why they are having such an awful season.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the three former Knicks either in another uniform or on
the injury list, there was another indirect casualty of the deal.
P.J. Carlesimo is currently serving as a college basketball
analyst.

THE SPORTS ETHICISTS COME OUT IN FORCE. LET'S IGNORE THEM, OK?
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Fla.)  (rk) 
 By ROBERT LIPSYTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Call this the Era Between the Vinces. Big-time spectator sport
is struggling to figure out how much of its market wants that
old-time religion (as preached by coach Vince Lombardi of the Green
Bay Packers) and how much wants the new-time sensations (as peddled
by Vince McMahon of the World Wrestling Federation.)
</P>
<P>
   In such a vacuum, there is always a call for ethics, those soft,
wiggly rules that can be used to whip the unruly, tie up the weak
or shake in the face of the willful. Should we suspend a rock-head
pitcher for speaking his mind, however confused? Should we mike pro
coaches so we can see just how seat-of-the-pants the game is, like
our lives? Who should be allowed to subsidize the career of an
amateur athlete?
</P>
<P>
   So, just in time for March Madness, spring training, the hockey
and basketball playoffs and football practice, the Sports Ethics
Institute is opening its Web site (www. sportsethics. com), the
editor of ESPN the Magazine explained all, a former Bobby Knight
player blew a whistle and nosy people are sniffing around the St.
John's star Erick Barkley, whose case which, if followed to its
logical conclusion, will ruin Western civilization. Those pillars,
the church, the university, the news media and the sneaker
companies, are all involved.
</P>
<P>
   I'm actually concerned about Barkley. He is only a sophomore but
is already 22 years old, which is almost too old for the NBA these
days. He has never had a really good new car. He seems to be a
product of the worst kind of white colonialism practiced in America
now, do-gooders making sure black kids get over through basketball.
</P>
<P>
   People at Riverside Church, a human rights fortress, are
slapping their foreheads over this _ ``My God, we had no idea'' _
even though the Riverside Hawks have been storming through the
country for years, in Nikes, winning amateur basketball
tournaments. Did the church think the players were missionaries?
Maybe they were.
</P>
<P>
   So there will be an ethics committee meeting, and someone will
be blamed. Maybe it will be Ernie Lorch, a nice white millionaire
lawyer seemingly with no other life but the Hawks. He thought he
was doing a good thing for those players, and he was. It's not as
though the black community rose up to wipe out all those drug-money
local playground tournaments that fed into the sneaker-money summer
camps that fed into the white colleges run by presidents who
answered only to their coaches who prepared their players for David
Stern's global game, which is now undergoing an economic
correction.
</P>
<P>
   You think we need some ethics here?
</P>
<P>
   Marcia Sage, a former San Diego lawyer who is now president and
chief executive officer of the Sports Ethics Institute in Tampa,
Fla., took a deep breath. ``Moral philosophers don't take positions
so much as explore the issue, offer considerations,'' she said last
week. ``It's not clear cut. You can't just look at outcome. What
are the virtues here? What is the greater good being performed by
the church? Who is being hurt?''
</P>
<P>
   Those ethicists are going to have to wear beepers all the time,
carry cells, be permanently online.
</P>
<P>
   I went to hear John Papanek, editor in chief of ESPN the
Magazine, who somehow never frontally addressed his advertised
topic, ``The Ethics of Promoting Sports Thugs.'' This was held last
week in the parish house living room of the Episcopal Church of the
Incarnation in Manhattan, as part of its series on ethics in media.
It was the church's first sports-related forum.
</P>
<P>
   Papanek said that ``sports is entertainment, it's all about
putting on a show,'' and that ``parents need to teach their
children that athletes are like actors, they are playing a role.''
I thought that was good advice, but later in the week wished
Papanek could expand on that when I saw ``CNN Newsstand's''
excellent piece on Bobby Knight's abusive and humiliating coaching
style at Indiana. What role could he be playing?
</P>
<P>
   All the bleeps made it hard to understand what Knight was
ranting about. One former player accused Knight of having choked
him. Knight should either be committed for psychiatric observation
or sent to the NBA, where he and Latrell Sprewell could choke each
other.
</P>
<P>
   As far as I can recall, Knight has never been the target of a
full-scale NCAA investigation; it is always claimed that he runs
``a clean program,'' and that most of the athletes who don't bail
out of his teams early go on to graduate and lead productive lives.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe we don't need more ethics or the NCAA. Give the Erick
Barkleys what they deserve, stretch limos driven by business majors
with English majors in the back writing their term papers. The
equivalent of soft money wouldn't have to be channeled through
nonprofits like churches, so these players could go to prep school
after high school so they could learn to read ESPN the Magazine on
college road trips while they became physically ready for the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   If we have to have ethics at all in sports, let's make sure
those moral philosophers explore the right issues. Should Pete Rose
wear his Phillies or Reds cap to the Hall of Fame? Was O.J. Simpson
the greatest running back in history? &QL;

   ATLANTA _ From a rooftop loudspeaker, the Islamic call to prayer
peals out across the park and small homes of the southwest Atlanta
community of West End.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintive song calls worshippers _ some in business suits
and some in religious attire _ to a small green home with white
trim, their mosque on West End Place.
</P>
<P>
   Among them walks Khalid Abdul Muhammad, a former spokesman for
the Nation of Islam, dressed all in black and wearing a Black
Panthers pin. He sweeps by news crews as though they aren't even
there.
</P>
<P>
   Friday was unlike any other day in West End.
</P>
<P>
   People here fear that this tight-knit community of 3,400 people,
with its proud history of self-reliance, will be defined by the
gunning down of two deputies Thursday night. Their concern is
intensified because police are searching for a leader in this
community, Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin, known in his days as a Black
Panther as H. Rap Brown.
</P>
<P>
   There's more to the story of West End, people say. It is a place
that is predominantly black but also home to a thriving historic
district, respected cultural centers, an amalgam of religions and
cultures _ Christians, Muslims, African Hebrew Israelites _ who
live in harmony.
</P>
<P>
   ``The diversity is great, and that's one of our strengths,''
said Sharon Allen, president of the West End Neighborhood
Development community association.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a mile from the mosque is a vegetarian restaurant run
by the African Hebrew Israelites and the historic West Hunter
Street Baptist Church, once the pulpit for Ralph David Abernathy
Jr.
</P>
<P>
   The Black Christian Nation operates the Shrine of the Black
Madonna Bookstore and Cultural Center one of the premier black
bookstores in metro Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Colvin has driven from a neighboring county to the
bookstore on a spiritual journey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking for truth,'' said the 33-year-old computer
student, who grew up in a traditional Christian household but now
is exploring his African heritage. Paying for a book on African
cultures, he said, ``This bookstore has so much more than Barnes &AMP;
Noble.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking his money was Safiya Angolwisye, a member of the shrine
who lives in the church's apartment building nearby on Peeples
Street. ``I think it's safer than Buckhead,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Peeples Street says a lot about West End. At the end of a block
lined with restored Victorian homes worth several hundred thousand
dollars each is a burned-out hulk of a home left to rot, one of
many in this community. And across the street, on another moribund
building, is graffiti that reads like community activism rhetoric.
In white spray paint on red brick, it reads, ``No More Turning Our
Backs on West End.''
</P>
<P>
   Activism in West End has always been hard-core. Some of the
strongest community leaders were once members of the Black
Panthers. The vibrant political scene is continually recharged by
students from the nearby Atlanta University Center.
</P>
<P>
   Again and again, the community, Atlanta's oldest community, has
been uplifted by its own designs and forcefulness. In the 1960s,
West End was devastated when the construction of I-20 displaced
entire blocks. The neighborhood since has rebounded, with new homes
built on land left vacant by the expressway.
</P>
<P>
   ``This community is anchored by homeowners _ African-Americans
who put money into this community to buy houses and apartment
buildings,'' said Janice White Sikes, a former president of the
community association.
</P>
<P>
   When she moved here about 25 years ago, ``It was in really bad
shape, a shell of a community.'' Boardinghouses abounded, and they
brought with them crime and poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Muslim community, which began moving into West
End in the 1970s and has grown continuously, have been ``good
neighbors,'' she said. Many residents say the Muslims have helped
rid the neighborhood of drugs and prostitution.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972 the Mall West End was the first shopping center in
Atlanta to feature a black Santa.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, residents believed banks and insurance companies
were red-lining the neighborhood, keeping loans from blacks.
Neighborhood activists, such as Sikes and her late husband,
complained all the way to Washington and prompted a federal probe.
</P>
<P>
   The 1991 designation of a portion of the neighborhood as a
historic district helped stem the tide of boardinghouses.
</P>
<P>
   When the neighbors were fighting to create a historic district,
developers tried to tear down Brown High School. Sikes and the
community battled back, and the building now stands as the only
technology middle school in the city.
</P>
<P>
   But community leaders acknowledge there are problems. There's
the homeless man known as Arnold who stands at the Lee Street exit
ramp, holding a sign asking for money. The gas station there
requires that you pay before you pump.
</P>
<P>
   Vacuuming his 1982 Buick LaSabre at the station was Ulysses
Cofield, 36. ``I like the West End,'' he said. ``It's a black
neighborhood. Lots of soul food joints. Everything I need is here _
bars, stores. It's self-contained.''
</P>
<P>
   There's crime, but he believes there's crime everywhere. The
homelessness gets him down, though.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before Christmas, a 3-year-old boy was kidnapped during
a carjacking at Kroger CitiCenter. Also, a elderly woman recently
was murdered in an apartment complex on the fringe of West End.
</P>
<P>
   But many people say they feel safe on the streets here, and the
streets are always busy with activity.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday afternoon, 19-year-old Dalir Asad, dressed in a blue
pinstripe suit, was selling bean pies on the street outside Mall
West End. Nearby, a man was preaching to raise money for his
church.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street is a strip of stores including a pawnshop, a
check-cashing service, a wig shop and a music store.
</P>
<P>
   With the coming of spring, plans are under way for the annual
Malcolm X Festival at West End Park. But now that park is filled
with news crews pointing cameras at the Laundromat operated by
Al-Amin.
</P>
<P>
   Walking into the Laundromat, Alvin Munson, 43, brought $15 in an
envelope ``to show my support'' for Al-Amin.
</P>
<P>
   What does the future hold for West End?
</P>
<P>
   Troy Sikes, 22, offered a positive spin during lunch with his
mother, Janice, at Chanterelle's restaurant, where Vice President
Al Gore recently visited.
</P>
<P>
   He sees more young people settling here, ``understanding that
it's a community, not just a neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   Still others worry about recent events.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Edward Spriggs, director of Hammonds House
Galleries, met with officials of the Atlanta Chamber of Commerce.
The meeting went well. They spoke about the West End as an
undiscovered gem.
</P>
<P>
   But before he went to sleep that night, he heard the news of the
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned that will overshadow their opinion,'' he said.

DEALING WITH JOHNSON'S REQUEST FOR RICHES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's as if Keyshawn Johnson were a used Subaru. The New York
Jets are desperately trying to trade him away rather than
renegotiate his contract. And it is becoming clear that the
contract Johnson wants would not only make him the highest-paid
wide receiver in football, it would also make him the highest-paid
player.
</P>
<P>
   According to several NFL officials with knowledge of the
situation, Johnson believes he is worth $9 million or even $10
million a year. Those officials also say Johnson wants a signing
bonus of some $15 million.
</P>
<P>
   Giving a wide receiver that kind of money, the Jets reason,
would destroy their team's financial structure and create havoc
with the salary cap, which is currently $62.172 million. If Johnson
were to receive $10 million a season, he alone would eat up roughly
16 percent of the team's cap.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's agent, Jerome Stanley, would neither confirm nor deny
what his client is seeking. ``The best thing for me to do at this
point is not say a word,'' he said. ``I have no comment.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt that the Jets are continuing their aggressive
efforts to trade Johnson. They have spoken to at least six teams
and as many as 10. According to league officials, the Jets' general
manager, Bill Parcells, plans to continue to shop Johnson at the
owners' meetings that begin next Sunday in Palm Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Don't believe any nonsense about how Parcells is not upset with
Johnson. Parcells has explicitly told several football executives
that he takes Johnson's contract stance to mean that the wide
receiver is no longer a team player.
</P>
<P>
   The Baltimore Ravens remain a strong contender to get Johnson,
despite the public declaration of coach Brian Billick that talks
between the two teams have cooled. Billick and Parcells will most
likely talk at the owners' meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Bill, rightfully so, is exploring his options,'' the
Ravens' principal owner, Art Modell, said of Parcells. ``He's
talking to a bunch of teams and taking his time with this. From
what I understand, there is a lot of interest in Keyshawn. A lot of
teams are listening.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a difference of opinion that splits almost evenly about
whether Johnson's demands are outrageous.
</P>
<P>
   Many executives believe that a team cannot give a contract of
that magnitude to any one player, unless he is a star quarterback.
They agree that the Jets should trade Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Football is going to become like baseball,'' one head coach
said. ``You are going to see more NFL teams say, `This player wants
too much money, he's too expensive, so let's try to trade him now
and get something for him.' Bill Parcells is just the first of many
who will take this approach.''
</P>
<P>
   But others point to the current pay rate for a top receiver,
about $7 million a season, and ask what the difference is between
$7 million or $8 million or $10 million. They say it is more than
they want to pay, but that is the way of modern football.
</P>
<P>
   After all, two years in the future, when the salary cap has
increased and Johnson's contract is up, a $10 million-a-year wide
receiver might not be so ludicrous. In fact, it might be the going
rate for a player of Johnson's caliber.
</P>
<P>
   One owner whom the Jets have contacted about Johnson said $8
million or $9 million ``does not scare me; not at all.''
</P>
<P>
   It does frighten the Jets, which is why Johnson is in this
situation to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   Rethinking Replay
</P>
<P>
   There is an increasing possibility that instant replay might not
be approved by the owners when they gather for their annual
meetings this month.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL reinstated replay on a one-year trial basis last season.
It was used from 1986 to 1991, but was then dropped until last
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hopeful that it will be voted in again,'' said Minnesota
Vikings Coach Dennis Green, a member of the competition committee,
``but it will be difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Instant replay, for the most part, worked well this past season.
But the impending replay battle shows a weak point of how the NFL,
and other sports, sometimes do business. Owners tend to vote on how
things affect their teams or seasons instead of looking at the big
picture, which is that the current replay system, overall, works
and is better for the league.
</P>
<P>
   For replay to pass again, 24 of 31 teams would need to approve
it. Last season, replay was adopted on a 28-3 vote. Some league
officials believe that if a vote were taken today, replay might
fall one or two votes short.
</P>
<P>
   The Ricky Williams Mess
</P>
<P>
   The latest complaints by New Orleans running back Ricky Williams
are an attempt by the player to force the team to trade him, one
Saints official said. But the chances of the team's trading
Williams are slim to none.
</P>
<P>
   A trade would wreak havoc with the team's salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with Sports Illustrated, Williams ripped his
teammates for lacking pride, said the team should be moved to San
Antonio because New Orleans was not a nice place to live, and said
that his incentive-based contract was a mess and that he wanted to
restructure it.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' harsh words should not have come as a surprise.
Several months ago, Williams said many of the same things,
including how much he wanted out of New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   The Saints now have a mess on their hands. They have an
obviously unhappy key player on their roster who has criticized his
teammates and the city he plays in. But the Saints cannot trade him
without hurting their salary cap situation because his entire
contract would count against this year's cap. And it will be almost
impossible for them to smooth over the feelings of many Saints
players, who even before the Sports Illustrated article did not
like Williams. Now they probably do not want to be in the same room
with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will pass,'' one Saints official said.
</P>
<P>
   The team is crossing its fingers hoping that is true.
</P>
<P>
   Vikings Go to Plan B
</P>
<P>
   Now that Dan Marino has decided to retire instead of becoming
the Minnesota Vikings' quarterback, the team is turning its
attention back to Jeff George. The Vikings will have to do some
serious fence mending with him since they at first had decided that
George was not in their plans. But George is willing to listen, and
coach Dennis Green is good at getting players to see his side of a
situation.

HIALEAH MEET OPENS AT GULFSTREAM WITHOUT THE FLAMINGOES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALLANDALE, Fla. _ The 700 flamingos didn't make the trip, but
everything else did, from horses and trainers to hot-dog vendors
and parking valets. It was a trip that covered only 15 miles on the
ground, but it covered decades of rivalry that took a rare and
perhaps softer turn Friday when Hialeah opened its racing season at
Gulfstream Park.
</P>
<P>
   To most racing fans in South Florida who had become accustomed
to the yearly haggling and legislative battles over racing dates,
it seemed unworkable _ like the Hatfields moving in with the
McCoys. But it came about after a hurried series of negotiations
triggered by Frank Stronach, the Canadian industrialist who bought
Gulfstream Park last year and assumed a growing reputation as the
new strong man of racing.
</P>
<P>
   The switch was agreed upon only two weeks ago, leaving much
confusion about immediate details and much uncertainty about
long-range issues. And the transition led to overnight turmoil.
Gulfstream ended its 63-day season on Thursday; Hialeah began its
58-day season on Friday. Even the public-address voices changed
overnight. But the lush setting stayed, with perhaps the uneasy
feeling that an era was ending, or maybe beginning. Still, only
5,283 persons showed up Friday to find out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peace in Florida racing,'' said John Brunetti, the chairman of
Hialeah. ``This has been a long day coming.''
</P>
<P>
   And David Romanik, who took over on Friday as president of
Gulfstream, said in a greeting printed in the Hialeah program in
green ink for St. Patrick's Day: ``Gulfstream Park is pleased to be
the site of the 2000 Hialeah Park meeting, marking a new era of
cooperation in Florida thoroughbred racing.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, so good. But nobody honestly believed that a few
diplomatic words could ease the pain of three decades of angry
words spoken in legislative sessions where both tracks struggled to
gain the same thing: the lucrative racing dates in the winter
tourist season. Gulfstream won, but deemed the victory insecure;
Hialeah lost, but stayed alive with smaller audiences and with
simulcasting revenue tiding the track over its hard times.
</P>
<P>
   Then along came Stronach with his resources and his vision of
racing, and suddenly Hatfield was being invited to visit McCoy.
</P>
<P>
   Historic overtones could be heard. Hialeah was opening its 75th
racing season with memories of the days when it operated the most
beautiful track in America and ran horses on a surface widely
acclaimed as the best in the country. It was where the wealthy
spent their winters: arriving by special train, wintering in Palm
Beach, racing at Hialeah with its royal palms and Mediterranean
buildings. The 700 flamingos who nested on the slopes of the
infield lake were symbolic of a way of life as they flew in mass
formation every afternoon past the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   But now, Hialeah was in the center of a largely working-class
community and was being upstaged by Gulfstream, its neighboring
track to the north of Miami. Each track opened for only two months
of the year, which left six months of racing to a third track in
the area, Calder, which was bought last year by Churchill Downs in
a networking spree that rivaled Stronach's.
</P>
<P>
   So, Gulfstream and Hialeah half-buried the hatchet and searched
for answers. But the differences were wide.
</P>
<P>
   In the season it closed Thursday, Gulfstream averaged 10,373
customers a day, a decline of 3.8 percent from the 1999 meeting.
On-track betting totaled $2 million a day, a tiny fraction below
last year's.
</P>
<P>
   Among the issues still to be solved: how to run grass races on
Gulfstream's worn-out turf course. For a time, it was suggested
that Gulfstream was negotiating another revolution with Hialeah:
running one day each week, probably Thursday, on the lush turf at
Hialeah and simulcasting the races back to Gulfstream.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been talking, but it doesn't look imminent,'' Romanik
said. ``Too many details to be ironed out in too short a time.''

EDITORIAL: EARLY CAMPAIGN CLASHES 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, March 19:
</P>
<P>
   Removing any doubts that theirs would be a long, tough campaign
for the White House, Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush
attacked each other last week in extremely personal terms. Whether
the public as a whole has an appetite for months of squabbling is
an interesting question. Bush has the additional problem of
demonstrating that he truly is a uniter, not a divider, of his own
party. Based on his resistance to fully embracing the campaign
finance agenda of Sen. John McCain and the confusion over meshing
his policies with those of congressional Republicans, he has some
work to do.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates need to reach beyond their parties as well. The
task may be easier for Gore simply because while Bush was forced to
the right to get the nomination, the vice president stayed in the
center. But Bush is clearly hoping that he can prevent the vice
president from winning independent votes by hammering at the issue
of Gore's trustworthiness. That is part of the reason this campaign
has begun on such a sour note. By asserting that Gore will do
anything to win the election, the governor may have hit on an
effective way of tying together the doubts that many people have
about Gore's tendency to exaggerate and his fund-raising in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But the problem for Bush is that he cannot yet claim to have
calmed down his party. He asserted in an interview with this
newspaper that his views had not been changed by his competition
with McCain, then later took a more conciliatory tone. The Bush and
McCain camps are in a struggle over the makeup of the Michigan
delegation. On Tuesday, in his first speech since suspending his
campaign, McCain may well renew his demands for Bush to become a
full supporter of campaign-finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has begun sending signals to Republican congressional
leaders that he would love a compromise with the White House that
might take gun control off the table. But GOP hard-liners, echoing
the National Rifle Association, do not want to give an inch. On
budget issues there is even more discord. Bush's tax-cut scheme is
so extreme that the Republican leadership rejected it, coming up
with a smaller tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, Gore faces a test of his own skills as a
uniter on the trade issue. Many Democrats are opposed to granting
favorable trade status to China and approving its entry into the
World Trade Organization. Some cite China's human rights record
while others are simply echoing organized labor. Gore has made
clear his own support of China's membership in the WTO, but he is
not exactly leading the fight on Capitol Hill. He is leaving that
to President Clinton. Bush, by contrast, has been speaking in favor
of Chinese membership, even though some in his party would block
China because of human rights.
</P>
<P>
   No one expects either Bush or Gore to be singing from his party
song book all the time. But these early tests of their ability to
work with their own colleagues may give clues as to their ability
to reach out to skeptics in the middle. There was a big turnout of
independent voters this year, in large part because of McCain. On
the Democratic side, for all the fireworks of the contest between
Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley, turnout was low. Voters may want
more than eight months of hurling insults. They will be looking for
signs of maturity, leadership and an ability to listen. &QL;

TAIWAN'S NATIONALIST PARTY UNDONE BY FORCES IT ENCOURAGED 
</HEADLINE>
  (With TAIWAN-ELECT and related stories.) 
(mk) 
 By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Taiwanese election marks a huge defeat for the Nationalist
Party, which in the 20th century controlled first China and then
Taiwan, and which presided over the emergence of the very
democratic forces that ultimately upended it.
</P>
<P>
   Sun Yat-sen, the great Chinese nationalist and revolutionary,
formed a predecessor organization of the Nationalist Party in 1894
while he was living in exile in Hawaii. The party's initial aim was
to overthrow the corrupt Qing Dynasty, which was already
disintegrating and finally collapsed in 1911-12.
</P>
<P>
   The party dominated China for the next few tumultuous decades,
although power was also divided among warlords and for a time the
Japanese invaders. Party leaders, such as Generalissimo Chiang
Kai-shek, were initially impressed by the organization of the
Soviet Communist Party and modeled the Nationalist Party along
Leninist principles, even calling each other ``comrade.''
</P>
<P>
   While they had a good deal of support from Americans, the
Nationalists became detested in China because of their corruption,
brutality and failure to fight the Japanese invaders. In 1949, the
Communists under Mao Tse-tung defeated the Nationalists and forced
them to flee and move their seat of government to the offshore
island of Taiwan, which had just been recovered from Japan in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   Some 2 million Nationalist soldiers and officials settled on
Taiwan, where they were bitterly resented by many local people. In
particular, the Nationalists were hated for massacring local people
during upheavals that began on Feb. 28, 1947, and ever since then
the phrase ``2-28'' has been a sensitive code word in Taiwan that
conjures those antagonisms between local people and the
mainlanders.
</P>
<P>
   The Communists might well have seized Taiwan in the early 1950s,
because Chiang's army was in chaos and America was unwilling to
help it. But then fate intervened: In 1950, North Korea invaded
South Korea, and Americans became increasingly fearful of communism
around the world. The upshot was that President Truman sent the
Seventh Fleet to protect Taiwan. Ever since, the United States has
either promised or hinted that it would protect Taiwan from a
mainland Chinese attack.
</P>
<P>
   In ruling Taiwan, the Nationalist Party had little ideology
other than self-aggrandizement and self-enrichment. Particularly in
the 1950s and 1960s, the security forces under Chiang and his son
and successor, Chiang Ching-kuo, often dragged away critics of the
regime. Initially, they were often killed immediately; later they
tended to face torture and sham trials.
</P>
<P>
   The Nationalists imposed their ideas and language on Taiwan, and
children were forced to speak Mandarin Chinese and punished if they
spoke the Taiwanese or Hakka dialects that they spoke at home.
There was almost no teaching of local history, and instead children
learned about distant mainland Chinese provinces that they could
never visit.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Nationalist Party redistributed land, promoted education
and encouraged the Taiwanese people to form businesses and get
rich. The result was an economic and educational revolution in
Taiwan that laid the seeds for a political one as well.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, the Nationalists responded to popular aspirations
and began to permit opposition party activities _ although even
then critics of the Nationalists were tortured and occasionally
killed. The playing field was never level, for the Nationalists
manipulated the news media and owned companies that gave them huge
economic resources, but they gradually allowed opposition figures
to win local elections and form local power bases.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest changes came after the death of Chiang Ching-kuo in
1988. Control of the Nationalist Party passed uneasily to Lee
Teng-hui, a Taiwanese who as vice president was Taiwan's new
president. Lee transformed the Nationalist Party by democratizing
it, distancing it from its mainland Chinese roots, and ultimately
by creating a more pluralistic Taiwan in which an opposition
victory became possible.

EDITORIAL: CLINTON'S JOURNEY TO SOUTH ASIA 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, March 19:
</P>
<P>
   With just 10 months left in office, President Clinton on Sunday
begins one of the most important trips of his presidency. Though
India, Pakistan and Bangladesh make up a sixth of the earth's
population, no American president has visited this turbulent region
since Jimmy Carter in 1978. In part, the long neglect is
attributable to the Cold War, when Pakistan was assigned the role
of front-line ally against the Soviet Union while India got written
off as a friend of the Kremlin. Now, it is the tensions between
these two countries that threaten a nuclear war, and the United
States needs to re-energize its approach to their problems.
</P>
<P>
   India is the first stop and showcase of Clinton's trip, as it
should be. Since the acceleration of economic reforms in 1991,
India has enjoyed impressive economic growth. Most of its
population still lives in hundreds of thousands of small villages,
while other Indians are developing software in high-tech centers
for export to America. Appropriately, Clinton plans to visit both
of these Indias, and to stop at tourist sites like the Taj Mahal.
It has always been odd for the United States not to have a closer
relationship with the world's most populous and diverse democracy,
and the president's visit can move toward that goal. But while
trying to reach agreements on trade, technology transfer and
environmental issues, Clinton must make clear that his greatest
interest is to see India and Pakistan reduce the danger of a
nuclear confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   In Bangladesh, which has also made economic gains in recent
years, Clinton will encounter another reminder of the region's
violent past. Like so many South Asian leaders of recent decades,
the country's prime minister, Sheik Hasina Wazed, is the daughter
of an independence leader. Her father, Sheik Mujibur Rahman, was
assassinated in 1975, a few years after he led Bangladesh to
freedom in the last India-Pakistan war. Clinton's visit can lead to
further assistance to help Bangladesh fight disease, hunger and
overpopulation.
</P>
<P>
   But the trickiest part of Clinton's trip will come at the end,
when he stops briefly in Pakistan. The visit was added in response
to Pakistani warnings that a snub would encourage terrorist and
fundamentalist tendencies. In a speech last week, Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright said correctly that Clinton's decision
must not be seen as a sign of approval for the military coup in
Islamabad last year. Clinton needs to use his brief visit to press
for a quick return to democracy and for military restraint,
including an end to Pakistan's ties with terrorist and insurgent
groups in Kashmir, India's only Muslim-dominated state.
</P>
<P>
   By devoting four days to India and traveling throughout the
country, Clinton may earn enough good will for some frank talk
about Kashmir with his host, Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee.
There can be no military solution to the Kashmir problem. India can
take a step toward eased tensions by reducing its military forces
in Kashmir in return for reciprocal action by Pakistan, including
withdrawal of insurgent groups it may be supporting. In the nuclear
area, both countries need to make progress toward signing a
test-ban treaty and curbing deployment of missiles and production
of fissile materials.
</P>
<P>
   In his waning months in office, Clinton has a chance to nudge
peace efforts ahead in Northern Ireland and the Middle East.
Whether he can do so in South Asia as well will depend in large
part on how effectively he handles this week's visit.

<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ What best represents the tensions that await Pope
John Paul II when he arrives on Tuesday for a momentous six-day
pilgrimage to ``the lion's den,'' as an Israeli magazine cover
labeled the Holy Land?
</P>
<P>
   Is it the Islamic mufti's refusal to attend an interfaith
gathering convened by the pope because the Israeli chief rabbi will
be there? (A last-minute substitute sheik was found.)
</P>
<P>
   Is it the brouhaha in Israel after the Star of David was erased
from the ambulance that will travel in the pope's entourage, though
it is customary to remove insignia wherever he travels?
</P>
<P>
   Is it the Palestinian assertion that the pope's visit to a
refugee camp will signal Vatican support for the right of
Palestinian refugees to return to their former homes in Israel?
</P>
<P>
   Or is it perhaps the heaping garbage that surrounded the
Basilica of the Annunciation in Nazareth until late last week?
Fearing a fetid embarrassment, the Israeli government reluctantly
paid the indebted city to settle a strike so that the trash mounds
could be removed from the site where tradition says the archangel
Gabriel told Mary she was pregnant with Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   For John Paul, 79, this pilgrimage is a deeply spiritual climax
of a 22-year papacy during which he never visited Jesus'
birthplace, walked in his footsteps or prayed at the site believed
to hold his tomb.
</P>
<P>
   (He did make a previous pilgrimage, however, in 1963, and Pope
Paul VI, never uttering the word Israel, made a 12-hour stop in the
Jewish state in 1964.)
</P>
<P>
   As the first official visit of a pope to Israel, it is also the
culmination of John Paul's long effort to redefine the way the
church sees Jews _ as ``elder brothers'' rather than traitors _ and
to reconcile Jews and Catholics. For many Israelis who stopped to
gape on President Street last week, the sight of the Vatican's
yellow and white flags being hoisted to flutter beside the Israeli
Stars of David was a breathtaking, history-making image.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing is purely spiritual or brotherly in a land where
religion and politics are permanently entwined, almost embedded in
the sandstone that has borne witness to millenniums of turbulent
history. And so the pope's visit is freighted with multiple layers
of sensitivities, and each stop on his carefully negotiated
itinerary means different things to different people with different
agendas.
</P>
<P>
   So many of the steps he makes will be on diplomatic eggshells,
tuning out the claims and counterclaims of sovereignty, religious
rights and nationalism. There is the recent claim by Yasser Arafat,
the Palestinian leader, that the apostle Peter should be considered
a Palestinian, for instance. And then there is the rabbis' demand _
unmet _ that the Vatican cancel a Mass in Nazareth on the Feast of
the Annunciation because it falls on the Jewish Sabbath.
</P>
<P>
   The pope's schedule was carefully balanced: a visit to Yad
Vashem, the Holocaust memorial site, in Jerusalem, and a visit to
the Dehaisheh refugee camp in Bethlehem; a meeting with the chief
rabbis, a meeting with the mufti (who agreed to see the pope
without the rabbis.)
</P>
<P>
   But demands are being made for even more symmetry. Since the
pope has recognized the enormity of the Holocaust, Islamic
religious leaders say he should acknowledge the atrocities
committed during the Crusades, too. ``He has asked forgiveness from
the Jews, so he should ask forgiveness from the Muslims,'' said
Sheik Ikrima Sabri, the mufti, who heads the Higher Islamic
Council.
</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul will arrive in Tel Aviv on Tuesday evening as
Israelis, dressed in costumes, will be celebrating the festive
holiday of Purim. A parade to mark this proud, raucous holiday of
Jewish survival will be led by a float featuring a 12-foot-high
figure of John Paul. That is, unless the ultra-Orthodox Shas Party
succeeds in having it banned as what one Shas member called a way
of ``debasing ourselves before the goyim,'' or non-Jews.
</P>
<P>
   More than 60,000 pilgrims _ 45,000 on special charters _ will
fly in from around the world to accompany the pope. They will join
a very small group of Roman Catholic faithful in Israel and the
Palestinian territories. Counts vary, but combined Palestinian and
Israeli statistics suggest that 180,000 Christians are in the Holy
Land, and many of them are Eastern Orthodox.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the numbers, the Christian population of the Holy Land
has dwindled because of emigration and accounts for about 2 percent
of the overall population, down from 13 percent in 1900. This
raises another agenda for the pope, one that is more germane to his
trip. Many Palestinian Catholics want a heightened incentive _ like
a papal appeal _ to soldier on as the guardians of the faith in the
Holy Land.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Hagopian, leader of the Middle Council of Churches in
Jerusalem, said that he hoped the visit would ``affirm in no
uncertain terms the life, presence and witness of local Christians
in the Holy Land _ all those Christians who were born here and
trace their ancestry to this biblical land.''
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian Christians in general, while they welcome the
spotlight on their existence, do not want to be mistaken for the
pope's faithful or those who must make amends for anti-Semitism.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is not representing the local Christian community but the
Western church,'' said Michael Karayanni, a Greek Orthodox,
Palestinian law professor who lives in Jerusalem. ``Religious
tensions between Christians and Jews are not felt here. Political
tensions, yes. But there isn't much anti-Semitism in our
community.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope will devote a full day to the Palestinian-governed
Bethlehem area.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, a Muslim, has assiduously courted the pope and
aggressively moved to propose the Palestinians as less ambivalent
caretakers than the Israelis for Christian holy places in the Holy
Land.
</P>
<P>
   For Arafat, the pope's visit is a tremendous coup, an on-site
and almost unrivaled affirmation of Palestinian sovereignty. To
have the pope make simultaneous first visits to Israel and the
Palestinians suggests a kind of equivalency of recognition that the
Palestinians have long sought from the world.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians are, comparatively speaking, ahead of the game.
The Vatican established diplomatic ties with Israel in 1993, 45
years after the country was founded. Before a Palestinian state has
even been established, the Vatican has recognized Palestinian
aspirations and did so more strongly than ever in a new agreement
last month, irking Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``This visit reaffirms the Vatican's longtime support for the
legitimate rights of the Palestinian people,'' said Emile Jarjoui,
a senior official of the Palestine Liberation Organization. ``His
visit to the Dehaisheh refugee camp is a clear message that the
suffering of refugees should end and their cause needs a just
solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Israelis have grown up suspicious of Christians and many
are ignorant about Christianity. The Israeli textbooks'
presentation of Catholicism leaves off more than 35 years ago,
before Vatican II discarded dogma that blamed Jews for the death of
Christ. It ends with Pope Pius XII's failure to speak out publicly
against the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   ``The textbooks ignore decades of profound transformation in the
church's attitude toward Jews,'' said Rabbi Ron Kronish, director
of the Inter-Religious Coordinating Council in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   At a forum last week in Jerusalem, Rabbi David Rosen, local
director of the Anti-Defamation League, was asked skeptically how
deep the transformation really went. ``Well, as the pope said to
me, in my eleventh visit to the Vatican, as we were being served a
glatt kosher meal,'' the rabbi said, pausing for emphasis because
he felt part of his point was already made.
</P>
<P>
   The ultra-Orthodox are largely indifferent to the pope's visit
while a small number of religious extremists are openly
antagonistic. A scrawl on the rabbinate building last week
screamed, ``Don't meet with the pope!'' But polls show that most
Israelis view the pope's visit favorably, even if they question the
potential for profound reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   Most are far more interested in the political than the religious
significance of the trip, especially the pope's handling of
Jerusalem's status. But they perceive the pope to be a positive
force, and he is widely portrayed here as having done more than any
other Christian leader ``in 2,000 years'' to reach out to the Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think his visit can change some attitudes in Jewish
communities toward Christians,'' said Moshe Hellinger, a modern
Orthodox Jew and political scientist at Bar Ilan University. ``But
it depends how firmly he says things. Remember, Jews are afraid
that Christians feel compelled to convert us. As long as the church
doesn't say firmly that we don't want to convert Jews, no serious
dialogue will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope's visit to Yad Vashem will be watched closely by many
Israelis who want to hear the pope apologize more concretely than
previously for the church's wartime silence and for its role in
fostering the anti-Semitism that fed the Nazi demonization of Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli political leaders have commented little about the visit,
which represents an overwhelming logistical and security
undertaking for the state. Some, like Shlomo Ben Ami, the internal
security minister, see it as an opportunity to demonstrate to the
world that Israel is a tolerant, open society. Most, however, give
the impression that their aspiration, as one senior security
official said, ``is to get through it without a disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope hoped keenly to bring together the three Abrahamic
faiths during his trip. But even this well-intentioned goal bumped
up against the tensions of the place.
</P>
<P>
   First the chief rabbi objected, because he did not want to enter
a church complex for the interfaith meeting. Later, he was
persuaded after learning that the gathering would not be held in
the church itself.
</P>
<P>
   The mufti, on the other hand, started with a positive attitude
and then apparently underwent a change of heart, said Monsignor
Eugene Nugent of the apostolic delegation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not see a need to meet with Jewish religious leaders,''
Sheik Sabri said in an interview. ``Meeting with them at this time
will make it appear as if everything is normal in Jerusalem, when
in reality it is not. There is an occupation and it should be clear
that there is no peace in the city.''

<P>
   When the snow went away _ in a rush, just as it came _ it left
behind the lawn, the garden, the pastures, the barnyard. It also
left behind locust pods, fallen branches, last fall's leaves,
snowplow scrapings, mire and muck _ the debris of a disordered
season. The snow's erasure has itself been erased. Everything is
matted to the earth or anchored in the mud except the ridges an
eastern mole has made while tunneling round and round. The early
bulbs seem desperate just now. Nothing else catches the hint of
spring from them.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the woods look no more disordered than ever. Chaos is always
thriving just beyond the tree line. All the work I do in the garden
dividing living from dead goes undone beyond the limits of the
barnyard fence. Downed limbs wrestle with understory thatch.
Birches whose crowns snapped in high wind this winter stand rigid,
wounds bright, crowns still waiting for the next high wind to
disarrange them further and force them all the way to the ground.
Somehow that indiscriminate tangle, the mass of all that bare
timber _ most of it merely unbudded, some of it pulp _ makes spring
seem like a betting proposition at best.
</P>
<P>
   I know there is an underlying order in the woods. What makes it
hard to see is its intricacy and its time scale. Any number of
interlocking communities dwell in what the eye sums up as a single
disarray. All those metabolisms, cross-conspiring, begin to slip
out of dormancy about now. The slow fires of decomposition and new
growth begin to burn with equal energy. One of the ways to see the
order in the woods is to look not at the stands of hemlock or white
pine or at the indiscriminate saplings springing up in an abandoned
field. The way to see it is to look at the gaps in even the most
knotted vegetation. I imagine each gap _ the hollow under a bank of
snow-matted goldenrod, for instance _ as an ecological niche, whose
occupants simply go unseen, who live and die in their own time,
seemingly unconnected to mine.
</P>
<P>
   That is an optimistic outlook, though it may not sound like it.
Gardening at the edge of wildness, I realize one thing. The order I
am able to impose on nature only extends so far, a few hundred feet
from the house at best. The horses help. They keep the pastures
clean-limbed. They like a clear line of sight as much as I do. But
in the garden itself _ that one word standing in mid-March for a
string of sodden beds and bare dirt _ the purpose is ultimately to
create a re-ordering of the wild order, a place of redistributed
complexity with an overlying, plainly perceptible simplicity. It
will always take imagination to see it at this time of year.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there are all those pods from the honey locust tree.
They are lying everywhere, curved, gloss-brown slivers a foot long.
People say that cattle love to eat ground-up locust pods. Living in
the country you learn to spend money in the meanest ways, and you
also learn the most extravagant parsimony. I'm going to rake up all
those pods this weekend. I won't be able to burn them or compost
them or throw them away. The thought that cattle would eat them
will haunt me until I get cattle. And who knows where that will
lead?

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Despite the chill in the surface air across the Northeast, the
upper levels of the atmosphere will begin a warming trend Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   A very large high-pressure system cresting over New Brunswick
Sunday morning will have barometric readings near 30.80 inches of
mercury. It will produce sunny and cool weather from New Jersey to
Quebec. Its broad circulation will draw moisture from the Atlantic
inland over a shallow dome of chilly air in the Southeast. This
combined with an approaching disturbance will cause cloudy skies
and a chill rain in parts of the Carolinas and Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Winds from the south extending from the surface to 30,000 feet
will transport milder, moist air into the Ohio and Tennessee
valleys. Thickening clouds and advancing showers will temper the
warming trend. Low pressure in Arkansas will move slowly east. A
corridor of cold rain will soak the region on the northwest flank
of this storm. Strong thunderstorms will drench the central Gulf
coast as a cold front plods eastward.
</P>
<P>
   A dense overcast will cover the central Great Lakes, and patches
of light rain are expected from northeast Iowa to Michigan. Sunny
and pleasant conditions are expected from the Dakotas to the
Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   A sharp cold front will swing through the northern Rockies with
heavy snow in the Bitterroots and northern Wasatch along with mixed
showers in the valleys. The snow will arrive across the southern
Wasatch on Sunday night. Colder, damp weather will be the rule west
of the Cascades. California will be bright, windy and not as warm
in the north.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Spring Arrives
</P>
<P>
   The arrival of spring at precisely 2:35 a.m. Eastern Standard
Time on Monday will mean little meteorologically. However, during
the next several weeks as the rays of the sun become more direct,
the weather will surely respond. The sun does not heat the
atmosphere directly, since the envelope of air is mainly
transparent to its high-energy radiation. The earth absorbs much of
the sun's energy. Lower-energy radiation from the ground then heats
the atmosphere from below. For several more weeks, the chill of the
past season will linger aloft, making possible more bouts with
wintry weather.

GOALS OF TOP AWARD WINNERS ARE BOLSTERED BY REALISM AND OPTIMISM

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One was honored for a memorable season at the helm of
one of yacht racing's toughest, trickiest one-design keel-boat
classes. The other was praised not only for her skills on the race
course, but also for organizational and leadership abilities in the
footlights of sailing's grandest stage.
</P>
<P>
   Though they had crossed tacks on numerous occasions during the
recent America's Cup trials in New Zealand, they were recently
reunited in New York for a ceremony to laud their accomplishments.
Last Wednesday, at the New York Yacht Club headquarters in
Manhattan, the Star sailor Eric Doyle and the America True
syndicate head Dawn Riley were named the 1999 Rolex Yachtsman and
Yachtswoman of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   Doyle, 31, a sailmaker who began his racing career off the Gulf
Coast of Mississippi and who now resides in San Diego, spent a busy
year competing aboard Melges 24s, his Star-class boat, and as the
mainsheet trimmer aboard Dennis Conner's cup challenger Stars and
Stripes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going from the Star to Stars and Stripes wasn't that hard,''
Doyle said. ``Like the Star, a cup boat has a great big main, a
small jib and a deep keel with a bulb. The overall concepts are
similar although they're obviously applied quite differently.''
</P>
<P>
   But Doyle's eyes grew wide as he described making the transition
from the 75-foot cup racer, with its 16-man crew, back to his
two-man Star dinghy, which is just short of 23 feet. ``Now that's a
lot harder,'' he said, laughing. ``You think, boy, this thing is
small.''
</P>
<P>
   For decades the Olympic-class Star has attracted some of the
world's best sailors, a fact that's underscored by its roster of
gold medalists and world champions, including Paul Elvstrom, Lowell
North, Dennis Conner, Paul Cayard, and Torben Grael. Conner has
said the planet's toughest regatta to win is the Star worlds.
</P>
<P>
   Doyle added his name to that illustrious list with a one-point
victory in the 1999 Star world championship off Punta Ala, Italy.
``The quality and depth in the fleet was just tremendous,'' he
said. ``To this point it's the pinnacle of my career.''
</P>
<P>
   It was just one step toward a greater goal, however, because
next month Doyle and his crew, Tom Olsen, will compete in trials
off San Francisco for the Star-boat slot on the U.S. Olympic
sailing team. ``We're not through yet,'' he said. ``Not even
close.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley, a 35-year-old native of Detroit, is also looking ahead.
But her sights are once again set on Auckland, where her San
Francisco-based America True coed squad emerged as one of the top
American efforts in the challenger's trials leading up to the
recent cup match, which was won in convincing fashion by Team New
Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   ``America True is moving ahead,'' she said. ``Winning this award
is kind of a thank you for everyone who's supported us so far, and
it also gives us a nice platform to jump off for the next one.''
</P>
<P>
   Though America True's budget of $12 million was a fraction of
that spent by many of the challenging syndicates, Riley's squad was
a giant killer in the early round robins before running out of
steam in the semifinals of the series. ``Every single person on our
team was doing what they'd dreamed of, which was doing an America's
Cup campaign,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``Having a small budget was actually a strength. It
meant we really had to think through problems and use every dollar
effectively.''
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the cup, Riley's San Francisco rival, Cayard
of America One, said he believed that the United States needed to
merge forces into a super-syndicate to ensure future success
against the Kiwis.
</P>
<P>
   Riley didn't buy that. ``It was a statement made in defeat,''
she said of Cayard's remarks. ``If they'd limited it to one
American team, we wouldn't have existed. Sure, with one team you'd
have America's best sailors the next time around. But what happens
when they retire? We didn't start out with the big names, but we
brought 23 new cup sailors up to a very good level of experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley, a realist, said the New Zealanders will be tough to beat.
In fact, in the days before their match versus Italy's Prada
Challenge in the cup finals, she correctly predicted the 5-0 Kiwi
sweep.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were so many little things they were doing that you
could see they'd thought through every eventuality,'' she said.
``And they wouldn't have made all those little changes if they
weren't very happy with their boat speed.''
</P>
<P>
   But Riley, who decided at age 13 that she would compete for the
cup, is also an optimist. ``We have to make ourselves stronger as
challengers, and hope they don't progress as fast,'' she said. ``I
think catching up to them is doable. We're closing the gap.''

CHASTAIN'S PENALTY KICK WINS ALGARVE CUP
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOULE, Portugal _ This was not the most important soccer match
Brandi Chastain has ever won with a penalty kick, but she
nonetheless provided the American women with another substantial
victory Saturday, even if the stakes were not as high as the sun in
this beautifully whitewashed region at the southern tip of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Chastain provided the only scoring in a 1-0 victory over Norway
in the Algarve Cup, the most significant tournament outside the
World Cup and the Olympics and the only meaningful event the United
States had never won in five previous attempts.
</P>
<P>
   It was the most consequential victory for the American women
since their penalty-kick victory over China in last summer's World
Cup. Nothing had remained the same for the team, not the coach, the
lineup or even the preferred formation of attacking and defending.
However, some of the uncertainty about security under the new
coach, April Heinrichs, seems to have dissolved as she appears to
have decided that the World Cup roster will not significantly
change for the 2000 Summer Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's penalty kick did not have the drama or arresting
celebration of Chastain's World Cup moment, but it was equally
decisive. It came early in the run of play, rather than after two
hours of regulation and a pair of overtimes. In the ninth minute,
the Norwegian defender Bente Kvitland headed the ball too softly
toward goalkeeper Bente Nordby and Mia Hamm ran on to the pass in
the penalty area. She was taken down by Nordby and awarded a
penalty kick.
</P>
<P>
   Having made the World Cup winner before 90,000 spectators,
Chastain could afford to be relaxed before Saturday's audience of
850, including a couple of hundred fans in their sports bras, which
she more than anyone could appreciate.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike last year's Algarve final, when she clanged her shot off
the crossbar against China, Chastain calmly placed a right-footed
kick into the upper left corner of the net. She had taken her
decisive World Cup kick left-footed, but switched because the right
foot felt more comfortable during practice. She is one of the few
women in the world who can shoot assuredly with both feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you just have a feeling,'' Chastain said of placing
her kick into the upper left corner. She had gone to the other side
during the World Cup, but Saturday noticed that Nordby seemed to be
favoring that direction. ``I saw her lean to her left and I went
the other way,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   After a month of experimenting with younger players, Heinrichs
went to a lineup of World Cup regulars, missing only Michelle Akers
(nasal surgery) and Briana Scurry (strained quadriceps muscle). The
Olympics are six months away, but it was important for the
Americans to send a message to Norway, the only team to hold a
winning record (13-11-1) against them.
</P>
<P>
   Last month in Florida, Norway twice defeated an American team
that had just resumed training after a contentious contract dispute
and a boycott of a tournament in Australia. Norway remains the most
contentious rival of the Americans after handing them a bitter
defeat in the semifinals of the 1995 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   This American team was fitter and fresh, despite playing its
fourth game in seven days. Siri Mullinix replaced Scurry and
assertively patrolled the penalty area from the American goal in
her fifth international appearance, Lorrie Fair hustled to balls in
the defensive midfield, Hamm played with her usual roaming
intensity and Kate Sobrero displayed smothering muscularity in
central defense.
</P>
<P>
   Norway, which received a hat trick from midfielder Dagny
Mellgren in a surprise 3-0 victory over China in the semifinals,
did not muster a shot for the first 33 minutes Saturday. Mellgren
was muted by Chastain and Kristine Lilly on the wing and by Sobrero
inside, though she did strafe the goal mouth with a slicing shot in
the 47th minute. And in the closing minutes, Mullinix came off her
line several times to dive onto the ball and to thwart Mellgren,
once making a lunging save.
</P>
<P>
   Having used a 4-3-3 formation during the World Cup, the
Americans under Heinrichs have since preferred a 4-4-2, which gives
them one less forward but one more midfielder, allowing Shannon
MacMillan and her energetic skills into the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was important psychologically, because it was a
tournament we had never won, and even though we have time until the
Olympics, everyone is jockeying for position, and we want to take
whatever momentum you can get,'' Hamm said.

 &HT;    Officers vow to find former Black Panther
 &HT;    By Lyda Longa
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Hundreds of police officers and FBI agents continued
to search Friday evening for a former Black Panther turned
neighborhood leader who is wanted in the killing of one Fulton
County sheriff's deputy and the wounding of another.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they believe Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin, formerly known
as H. Rap Brown, is being harbored by someone who admires him for
his efforts to rid the southwest Atlanta enclave known as the West
End of drugs and prostitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will leave no stone unturned until we find this man,'' said
Capt. David Chadd, chief spokesman for the Fulton County Sheriff's
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Bill Campbell urged anyone with information that would
help police find Al-Amin to come forward. He warned that harboring
a fugitive charged with murder is illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Chadd said a 100-officer team searching West End for Al-Amin
early Friday morning was scaled back only after police determined
he was no longer within a four-block area near the Atlanta
University Center.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta homicide investigators and uniformed officers from the
precinct that covers that section of the city remained in the
neighborhood, however. That force was quadrupled after Deputy
Richard Kinchen, 35, died of multiple gunshot wounds Friday
afternoon at Grady Memorial Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   An all-points bulletin was issued before dawn advising that
Al-Amin could be driving a black, four-door Mercedes-Benz with
tinted windows and license plate 246MBG or a green Toyota
Four-Runner with Alabama plates 45AV431.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI issued a federal fugitive warrant for Al-Amin's arrest,
said spokeswoman Celeste Armstead.
</P>
<P>
   Aldranon English, 28, the deputy who survived the attack,
identified Al-Amin as the shooter after Atlanta homicide
investigators showed him several pictures from a lineup as the
officer lay in his hospital bed Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours later, English learned that his friend and partner
had died.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are heartbroken,'' said a solemn Sheriff Jackie Barrett.
``The entire department is taking this very hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said Al-Amin used a .223-caliber assault rifle to
attack Kinchen and English. The weapon is similar to M-16 and AR-15
rifles. The bullets are about 3 inches long and about a half-inch
in diameter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only purpose to use a weapon like the one he used is to
kill,'' Chadd said, referring to the weapon used in the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Kinchen, a nine-year veteran of the Fulton Sheriff's Department,
leaves behind a wife and two children.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deputy's demise was due to the horrendous trauma he
suffered from the attack with the assault weapon,'' Chadd said.
``His heart stopped several times, and he could not be revived.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a shame he had to die in such a heinous fashion,
especially since the deputies were only trying to serve him with a
warrant that was so minor.''
</P>
<P>
   Kinchen and English were attempting to serve a warrant on
Al-Amin late Thursday night for nearby Cobb County police.
</P>
<P>
   The warrant, issued Jan. 28 after Al-Amin failed to appear in
court, was for driving without proof of insurance and impersonating
a police officer. Thursday night, Atlanta police and Fulton County
sheriff's officials mistakenly said the warrant was for aggravated
assault.
</P>
<P>
   Police had arrested Al-Amin on May 31, 1999. He was driving a
stolen 1992 green Ford Explorer. He told the officer he had bought
the Explorer earlier in the month, according to the police incident
report.
</P>
<P>
   When Al-Amin pulled out his wallet, he had what appeared to be a
police badge, the report said. When the officer asked if he was a
cop, Al-Amin said yes, he was an officer in White Hall, Ala., the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Amin's run-in with the police would lead to tragic
circumstances nine months later.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Police Chief Beverly Harvard said the Fulton deputies
arrived at the rear of a grocery store Al-Amin has operated just
after 10 p.m. Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   When the deputies did not see Al-Amin inside, they went to the
front of the building. There they spotted a man beside a black
Mercedes-Benz, Harvard said. When the deputies approached him, the
man started shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The deputies shot back.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett said the shooter continued to fire at English as he
writhed on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only word I can use for this attack is `ambush,''' Barrett
said Friday morning at a press conference. ``There is just no other
word I can use.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Kinchen and English wore protective vests, the gear was
no match for the powerful bullets that struck the deputies, said
Dr. Jeff Salomone, surgeon for the Atlanta Police Department.
Salomone, associate professor of surgery at Emory School of
Medicine, said the slugs went under and around the vests.
</P>
<P>
   ``A vest offers no protection against a high-velocity bullet,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett said another surgeon at Grady told her that the wounds
sustained by the deputies ``looked like those seen in Vietnam.''
</P>
<P>
   The gunman was also injured. Harvard said investigators
searching for him followed a trail of blood that led to an
abandoned house near the scene. No one was inside. The Mercedes
that was parked in front of the store was gone.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Amin, 56, moved to West End in 1976 after he was released
from prison on a robbery conviction.
</P>
<P>
   He converted to the Muslim faith while in prison and changed his
name to Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin.
</P>
<P>
   His grocery store is about 100 feet from a blue frame building
that serves as a mosque.
</P>
<P>
   While Al-Amin has been well regarded in his community, Atlanta
police Detective Joseph Masterson Jr. said he was one of several
suspects in 20 unsolved West End homicides. But Al-Amin was never
charged. Deputy Chief C.B. Jackson and other police commanders
concluded they did not have enough evidence against him or other
suspects.
</P>
<P>
   The Muslim community, which has worked to revitalize West End,
showed support for Al-Amin after learning he is suspected of
killing the deputy.
</P>
<P>
   Nadim Ali, a spokesman for the Community Mosque of Atlanta,
urged caution and fairness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We the members of the Community Mosque of Atlanta would like
to state that the legal principle that a person is innocent until
proven guilty is also a concept that is consistent with the Islamic
belief. We ask you to avoid passing judgment until all the facts
are in and not use the media to accuse, try and convict Imam Jamil
Abdullah Al-Amin.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a respected leader in the Islamic community and his
works are well documented, not only in Atlanta, but throughout the
Islamic world.''
</P>
<P>
   Ali refused to answer questions from reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Bruce Harvey, who once represented Al-Amin, was
surprised to hear the allegations. In 1995, Harvey represented
Al-Amin when he was charged with weapons violations and aggravated
assault. He was accused of shooting a man in the leg in West End
Park. The charges were dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd put down the shotgun and picked up the Koran,'' Harvey
said. ``He's turned away from being a revolutionary and a radical
leader to being a spiritual leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why he would respond to these kinds of charges out of Cobb
County in that fashion would be unfathomable to me.''

BRAVES STILL DEALING WITH SERIES SWEEP
</HEADLINE>
   (With BBO-NOTEBOOK) 
(rk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   KISSIMMEE, Fla. _ It was to be the championship that validated
their label as the team of the '90s. The Atlanta Braves had
previously won seven successive division championships but had
appeared in ``only'' four World Series and, worse, had won only
one. By winning the 1999 World Series, however, the Braves would
provide proof that they deserved to be ranked with the greatest
teams ever.
</P>
<P>
   And then the New York Yankees swept them.
</P>
<P>
   ``To lose the Series is one thing; to be swept, to be honest
with you, is embarrassing,'' Terry Mulholland, one of the Braves'
veteran pitchers, said.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Glavine, the longest-running Braves' veteran pitcher, did
not disagree. ``Yeah,'' he said, ``I think it's a little more
embarrassing getting swept than it is to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' Glavine added, ``losing is losing. It's not fun. I
don't know that I feel any better about losing in 1991 because it
was a great World Series than I do in 1999 when we got swept. The
bottom line is we lost. It's a bad feeling either way, but
particularly so because it was a matchup we were looking forward
to.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves, the left-hander said, were playing well going into
the Series. ``We thought the outcome was going to be a whole lot
different than it was,'' he said. ``We didn't execute. We were
ahead in two games and had a chance to win, but we didn't close it
out. That was the big difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Mulholland recalled his previous World Series experience. ``When
I went through the Series in '93 with Philadelphia,'' he said, ``we
had quite a tough Series with the Blue Jays. It came down to Joe
Carter hitting a home run in the ninth inning to beat us. That
wasn't the case last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Cox, the Braves' manager, disagreed that even losing to
the Yankees was a negative development. He cited his team's 103
regular-season victories, most in the major leagues, as evidence of
the great season the Braves enjoyed. Managers, of course, are
supposed to see the positive side and dismiss any negative aspects.
</P>
<P>
   But Eddie Perez, one of the catchers, offered a similar view.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think so,'' he said when asked if losing in four games
was embarrassing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the Mets have a better team than us and we beat them,''
he added, a curious comment considering the Braves finished 6{
games ahead of the Mets. ``Going to the World Series with the
Yankees, a lot of people thought let's do the best. I think we did
the best when we played the Mets because they have a better team
and we beat them. I don't think we did a great job in the World
Series, but I think we did a great job going to the World Series.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Jordan, the right fielder, said the Braves deserved credit
for overcoming a collection of serious ailments and injuries, but
he acknowledged that being swept ``was difficult; there's no
question about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not they thought the sweep was embarrassing, the
Braves did not foresee the possibility that they could suffer any
aftereffects this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened the year before in the playoffs is the furthest
thing from your mind in the regular season,'' Glavine said,
``particularly for us this year.'' He mentioned the return of the
ailing players, Andres Galarraga and Javier Lopez, and how their
healthy presence has the Braves excited about the upcoming season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't mean anything,'' the pitcher added, referring to
the awful end to October. ``When we won in '95, it meant nothing in
'96. We had to go out and start all over on April 1 just like
everybody else. You have to put that behind you and be prepared to
do it all over again just like you do when you lose. You have to
put the anger or the soreness of losing behind you and look at what
you need to do in front of you to get back to that spot.''
</P>
<P>
   Glavine, however, was candid enough to suggest a different
mind-set could possibly take over if the team returns to the
Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe when you get in the playoffs,'' he said, ``you start
thinking about, `OK, we have an opportunity here; let's not lose
this year.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves were the second successive team to lose to the
Yankees in four World Series games. The Braves, despite their
crushing disappointment, saluted the Yankees for their remarkable
run.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's impressive,'' Glavine said. ``It's something you would
never in a million years bet on somebody doing. The odds are not
good, particularly in that forum where you have two teams so
closely matched. It's just tough to beat somebody four straight.
For them to do it eight straight over two years is really amazing,
but you've got to give them credit for being as good as they were
and going out there and executing as well as they did.''

BEING ROBBED AT POKER  
 A NEW CHANCE FOR HALTER 
2 LONG-TERM PROSPECTS
</HEADLINE>
   (With BBN-BRAVES) 
(rk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The incident last week in which two armed robbers menaced six
minor league players in the Houston Astros' organization reminded
Bobby Cox of a similar experience more than 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Cox was managing Syracuse in the New York Yankees' system in the
early 1970s, and the team was in Charleston, W.Va., for the start
of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was downstairs sitting in the lobby,'' the Braves manager
said. ``The players had saved up their meal money from being in the
big league camp in spring training, and they were playing cards
upstairs like we all did in the old days. There was a poker game
every night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two guys with shotguns came in and tied them up. They took
their money and their clothes and their briefcases. It happened at
10:30 at night. They tied them up with cords from telephones and
lamps. They tied up Jimmy Ray Hart, put him halfway under a bed and
they were stomping on his hands. Jerry Kenney came downstairs and
said, `You gotta come up here, you gotta come up here.' I said
what's going on. He couldn't talk. He said, `These guys stuck
shotguns right in our faces.'''
</P>
<P>
   Cox said police determined that it was an inside job, that
someone from the hotel was involved. In the Astros' episode, the
robber who was shot and wounded six times and was in the hospital
had a long record of arrests.
</P>
<P>
   A New Chance for Halter  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Shane Halter spent six years in the minor leagues before getting
a chance in the majors with the Kansas City Royals in 1997. But the
utility infielder-outfielder appeared in only seven major league
games last season, pinch-running five times for the Mets and
batting not at all. He will not bat for them this year either. The
Mets put him on waivers last week, and Detroit claimed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little surprised at what came about,'' Halter said.
``I didn't want to get released. I didn't want to leave the Mets.''
</P>
<P>
   But the 30-year-old did not help himself in his quest for a job
with the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had eight at-bats, went 2 for 8,'' he said. ``It was kind of
rough. I had two ground balls go right between my legs in games.
Spring training just started really so I was shocked to see it
happen as early as it did. But I'm kind of glad they did it because
I got an opportunity to go somewhere. Peoples' rosters weren't
full. I don't think I ever got a shot over there. I believe they
were going to keep Kurt Abbott and Charlie Hayes.''
</P>
<P>
   On Halter's second day in the Tigers' camp, another player at a
nearby locker was curious about the Mets' manager, Bobby Valentine.
</P>
<P>
   ``What did you think of Valentine?'' the player asked Halter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was all right,'' Halter replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're the only person I ever heard say he liked him,'' the
other player said. ``All the guys in Texas hated him.''
</P>
<P>
   2 Long-Term Prospects  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Is Johnny Oates just trying to make the best of off-season
developments, or could he turn out to be right? Clip and save.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the next three years,'' the Texas manager said, ``we will
score more runs with Kapler in right and Mateo in center than we
would have with Goodwin in center and Gonzalez in right.''
</P>
<P>
   Juan Gonzalez (trade) and Tom Goodwin (free agent) are gone. In
their place are a pair of youngsters, Gave Kapler and Ruben Mateo.
Oates' projection is bold. The Rangers' future fortunes rest on how
right he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Short term? I'm not sure,'' Oates said. ``Long term there's no
doubt in my mind we're better off.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers let Goodwin leave because it was time to find out if
Mateo is what they think he will be. They traded Gonzalez because
they did not want to pay him $17 million or more a year. The one
development they did not expect was the defection of Todd Zeile to
the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought we had Zeile and it just didn't work out,'' Oates
said.
</P>
<P>
   But the manager felt the decision to trade Gonzalez was a sound
one. ``If we don't do something, we'll be in trouble starting next
year,'' he said, meaning the Rangers would have lost Gonzalez as a
free agent and received nothing for him. ``We can be good this year
and very good next year. But if we hadn't have made the trade, we
could have been pretty bad next year. And I don't like the thought
of being bad any time.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates added: ``I want a chance to win every year. I do not want
to be the Miami team. You win it all one year, but their season is
already over this year and next year and probably the next year and
probably the next five years.''
</P>
<P>
   But for the Rangers to be good, Kapler, who came from Detroit in
the Gonzalez package, and Mateo, a farm-system product, will have
to produce, if not instantly, soon enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what these guys can do,'' Oates said. ``Together
they could drive in 150 runs. They could drive in 200. They could
drive in 75.''

METS' REED GOES ALL OUT FOR THE PERFECT PRACTICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. _ When it comes to taking the ball out of
Rick Reed's hand, Al Jackson has succeeded where Reed's mother
never could.
</P>
<P>
   When Reed was growing up, his mother saved the home run balls he
hit in youth games. But Reed was more interested in pitching and
would use the keepsakes to throw against the brick wall he
practiced on.
</P>
<P>
   Over and over, Reed would pitch to the wall, tossing curveballs
into the square he had drawn, or aiming for corners. The balls
would scuff and his mother would protest. But Reed pitched anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Reed, the 34-year-old Mets right-hander, is still stubborn. When
he throws between starts, he persists until he finds what he seeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm working on something in the bullpen, I want to be
perfect,'' Reed said. ``I won't quit until it is. I'll stay out
there all day and throw.''
</P>
<P>
   Or at least simulate throwing. Jackson, the Mets' bullpen coach,
tries not to let Reed wear himself out in those sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've just got to take the ball,'' Jackson said. ``But then
he'll stand there and shadow throw.''
</P>
<P>
   As he prepares for his start against the Chicago Cubs in Tokyo
on March 30 in the second game of the Mets' season, Reed is trying
to tire himself in his bullpen sessions so he does not feel too
strong and leave his pitches up too high in the strike zone. His
six-inning, 83-pitch effort against Detroit on Friday was one of
the best starts by a Met this spring, manager Bobby Valentine said,
and Reed succeeded in keeping the ball down.
</P>
<P>
   That is one of the things Reed feels he must do to last longer
in games. When his pitches are down, he gets ground balls. When
they are up, those outs become line drives to the gaps.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can train myself to keep the ball down, I can pitch more
innings,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in his three seasons with the Mets, Reed
averaged fewer than six innings a start last year. His improvement
in that area will be important to a team that must preserve its
strong bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   After letting Orel Hershiser and Kenny Rogers leave as free
agents and trading another starter, Masato Yoshii, the Mets have no
proven fallbacks if Reed or another starter falters.
</P>
<P>
   But Reed was at his best when it mattered most last season. He
pitched the game he considers his best ever: a three-hit,
12-strikeout shutout of Pittsburgh that kept the Mets alive in the
final weekend of the regular season. He followed that with two
strong starts in postseason victories.
</P>
<P>
   Reed had been 0-3 with a 5.04 earned run average in September
1998. Two stints on the disabled list in 1999 kept him fresh at the
end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was 50 innings behind everybody else,'' Reed said. ``I guess
that played a big part in it. But I'm not saying I want that much
time off again.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Reed knows he got a break because of the
injuries, a torn calf muscle and a strained middle finger. Since he
plans on staying healthy, he has to maintain his stamina by
regulating himself in the bullpen. That means going against his
instincts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll throw and throw and throw on his side day until he feels
like he's gotten it right,'' Dave Wallace, the pitching coach,
said. ``Theoretically, that's fine, until August and September.
You've got to save some bullets. He can still throw as often, just
not with the intensity that he likes.''
</P>
<P>
   Following the example of the Atlanta Braves' starters, Reed
likes to throw twice between starts, not once. He cuts back at
times late in the season, but it is his preference to make practice
perfect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been that way,'' Reed said. ``I guess you can't
teach an old dog new tricks. I guess I'm a little too hard on
myself sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed was fortified by his extra rest down the stretch last year,
but another problem almost undid him. The Mets had lost four of his
last five starts before the Pittsburgh game, and he knew something
was wrong. He analyzed videotape, searching for a flaw in his
delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson noticed that Reed's fastball was not moving sharply, and
he discovered that Reed was holding the ball too far back in his
palm, choking it. After two or three bullpen pitches, Reed knew he
had solved the problem.
</P>
<P>
   But Reed has learned it is easy to fall into bad habits. In a
side session before Friday's start, coaches noticed the same
problem again, and Reed re-adjusted his grip. Even if he perfects
it, there will always be something to work on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll throw one good, and then want to make it better,'' Reed
said. ``I think that's when I need to back off.''

 &HT;    Clinton visit encourages peace hopes in Kashmir
 &HT;    By Moni Basu
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SRINAGAR, India _ At the CNS cybercafe in downtown Srinagar,
owner Omayan Balti and his friends contemplate President Clinton's
visit to India, which starts today.
</P>
<P>
   How will Clinton travel to Bangladesh from New Delhi, one of
Balti's friends wonders. On a chartered flight?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no. He will fly on Air Force One,'' says Balti. ``Or is it
Air Force Two?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton has the ability to bring peace to Kashmir,'' Balti
continues, examining Thursday's headlines about Clinton in several
of India's English-language daily newspapers. ``After all, he is
the most powerful man on Earth. We wish Clinton would come to
Kashmir and see what is happening here, but he can't because of
security reasons. So we hope he can talk to Prime Minister (Atal
Bihari) Vajpayee in New Delhi and (Pakistani leader Gen. Pervez)
Musharraf in Islamabad and persuade them to talk; persuade them to
both let go of Kashmir.''
</P>
<P>
   As South Asia gears up for the first presidential visit to the
region in 22 years, Indians are expressing cautious optimism about
Clinton's potential as peacemaker. While most of India waits to see
if the American president can offer an acceptable peace deal, many
Kashmiris are hoping that he will help alleviate their predicament.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Clinton's trip, the Kashmiri problem will get much more
visibility. In that way, it's a very positive development for us,''
said Sheikh Showkat Hussain, a professor of international law and a
member of the Jammu and Kashmir High Court Bar Association.
``Whether it will yield any concrete results, I can't say.''
</P>
<P>
   `TINDERBOX' SITUATION
</P>
<P>
   India and Pakistan have fought three wars over the disputed
territory of Kashmir since they gained independence from Britain in
1947. For the past decade, Indian army and paramilitary forces have
battled an armed insurgency led by Islamic militants who want to
carve out an independent Kashmiri state or merge with Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   India accuses Pakistan of arming the insurgency. Pakistan claims
it only provides ideological support.
</P>
<P>
   Alarmed by both nations' testing of nuclear devices in 1998,
Washington has kept a close watch on the ``tinderbox'' situation in
Kashmir. Now, with Clinton's trip, Kashmiris are hoping Washington
will move one step closer to diplomatic intervention.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Clinton really wants to, he can really solve the problem
here,'' said Abdul Rashid Bhat, a farmer in Tulmulla, a village 15
miles east of the Kashmiri capital of Srinagar. ``If he can
persuade Israel to vacate the Golan Heights, then why can't he find
an answer to this? But the problem is that we don't have oil, and
the Americans, well, they are looking out for their own interests.
It is said that even God will not listen to poor people.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Kashmiris compare the situation here to that of the Middle
East, Northern Ireland or the former Yugoslavia. If the United
States can help resolve ethnic and religious disputes in those
troubled spots, they say, it should be able to do the same in the
subcontinent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ours is a complicated situation,'' said Abdul Qadir, a
Srinagar resident whose only son was killed by Indian security
forces in 1993. ``The solution has to satisfy India, Pakistan and
the Kashmiris. The three parties should be put into a room and told
to hammer out a solution and not be let out until they do so.
Clinton can help with third party mediation.''
</P>
<P>
   The All Parties Hurriet Conference, one of the militant groups
in Kashmir, has requested a meeting with Clinton to ask for the
appointment of an international arbitrator. But the Times of India,
quoting U.S. Embassy officials in New Delhi, said the president
would not agree to such a meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The APHC and other militant groups have promised large
demonstrations in New Delhi when Clinton addresses Parliament on
March 22. Syed Shabir Shah, the president of the Democratic Freedom
Party, announced that the protests are planned to draw world
attention to the Kashmir problem.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not just the Kashmiris who are hoping Clinton's visit
will trigger a solution to the conflict in Northern India.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone has to step in and solve the problem. It has been
going on for 50 years, after all,'' said Samir Basu, a former
managing director of Chloride India in Calcutta. ``Our economic
relationship with the United States is developing strongly. Now is
the time for Clinton to step in.''
</P>
<P>
   Relations between India and the United States were strained
during Jimmy Carter's visit to New Delhi in 1978, when the Cold War
dominated policies in South Asia. Indians, said Calcutta resident
Ashim Basu, a retired hematologist, are much more eager now to
welcome an American president.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is much more interest in Clinton's visit than there was
in Carter's _ especially because of the tension with Pakistan,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Clinton can include South Asia in his list of foreign
policy successes remains to be seen, but Indians _ Kashmiris in
particular _ are banking on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton is the only one who can solve this problem,'' said
G.N. Najar, a Kashmir villager from Tulmulla. ``For us, he is next
to God.''

COMMENTARY: STEP RIGHT UP, TEST YOUR SKILL AND WIN A NEW JOB
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By MATT PURDY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOMERSET, N.J. _ Joyce Axelrod and her partner, wearing matching
red shirts and white pants, delivered the exact same pitch again
and again to the milling crowd. Axelrod is no day worker hawking
soap samples on the street. She is a business executive, and she
spent Thursday asking anyone who would listen: ``Do you have any
clinical research experience? Do you have any clinical research
experience?''
</P>
<P>
   Only in certain company is that a workable pick-up line. But
Axelrod was in the thick of it, in a hotel ballroom near New
Brunswick amid hundreds of people at a job fair for the
pharmaceutical, biotechnology and health care industries.
</P>
<P>
   When Axelrod snagged a prospect for her company, which places
researchers in jobs, she implored: ``Do you know anyone else you
can recommend? If we place them, you get $500.''
</P>
<P>
   Job fairs, once picked-over salad bars for the downsized, are
now smorgasbords where worker-starved companies comb the thin ranks
of the underemployed, and where the gainfully employed scout better
deals. One day last week, there were two fairs just off I-287, a
corridor of corporate campuses and new housing developments, both
flush with the sense of possibility.
</P>
<P>
   The fairs _ the other was for high-tech jobs _ drew heavily from
the now-fashionable pocket protector crowd, for whom one's
abilities are a ``skill set'' and stock options are not an option,
but a must. You could hear a chemist lamenting, ``I think I'm going
to be stuck in polymers the rest of my life,'' or a swaggering tech
jockey delivering a postmodern come-on: ``I'm a hardware guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Judy McNish, staffing the popular Aventis Pharmaceuticals booth,
said, ``You would think that with unemployment as low as it is that
this place would be empty, but look at this line.'' Little wonder,
with many drug companies offering on-site fitness clubs,
convenience stores, dry cleaners, day care and prepared dinners _
plus top salaries and flextime. Still, she said, ``we really have a
lot of open positions.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why Brad Roman and Tom Molesky, fresh business graduates
of Fairleigh Dickinson, were in the Aventis line envisioning
entry-level sales jobs paying $40,000, plus a car, a laptop, maybe
a 401(k).
</P>
<P>
   More people at the Hirehealth fair were like John DeMarco. ``I'm
a physicist,'' he said, ``and I'm just here to see how much I'm
underpaid.'' Happy with his job, he said he had taken off work to
meet with a roofer about his new house _ which could make anyone
look hard at his paycheck. How far underpaid is he? ``About
$10,000,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The glitter of promise can be harsh for those left out. John
Lewinson, a chemist in his ``low 60s,'' has been trying to fit into
the soaring drug industry since his chemical industry job was
eliminated a few years ago. A consultant, he's often told he's
overqualified for permanent jobs, which he takes as a euphemism for
being too old. ``I've kept my spirits up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Eroding loyalty on all sides of the work equation feeds the
perpetual job hunt. An information technology specialist waiting in
the Bayer Corp. line said that since immigrating from Russia a
decade ago he had worked for three major corporations ``and a
couple of smaller ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Three hours later, and 30 miles north, the specialist, 48,
surfaced at the Hi-Tech Career Fair at a Parsippany hotel. ``This
is a country where all your dreams become reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Lorne A. Epstein, recruiting for Telco Systems, a computer
communications company in Washington and Boston, came to Parsippany
in desperate search of engineers and programmers. Last week he
prospected in Ottawa. The salaries, he said, ``are getting crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Telco's literature promises a ``highly competitive compensation
and benefit package, including 401(k), two weeks' vacation, casual
dress and volleyball and basketball courts for lunchtime games.''
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere of plenty is infectious, even for a high-tech
recruiter, making $40 to $60 an hour. ``I met a woman in Ottawa,''
he said. ``She's a contract recruiter. She said, `Come out to
California. I'll pay you $150 an hour.' That's $350,000 a year.''
</P>
<P>
   So when's he leaving? ``I thought about it,'' he said, then
corrected himself. ``I'm thinking about it.''

TINSLEY BRINGS A BIT OF BROOKLYN TO IOWA STATE'S OFFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Calif., Iowa)  (lh) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Jamaal Tinsley hustled to the court at Public
School 305 in Brooklyn by 10 o'clock each morning and played
basketball until long past dark. Sometimes, it was 9:30 p.m. when
his mother would stop hollering his name, march to the park and
drag him home. Jamaal was 6 years old.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he was 7, Tinsley caused people to stop and gawk
whenever he touched a basketball. He could dribble the ball between
his legs and around his back, treating it like a yo-yo while most
7-year-olds had trouble even lifting the ball over their heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could do things,'' Tinsley said, ``that people never saw.''
</P>
<P>
   Tinsley was 15 when he played at the famed Rucker Park against
much older players. He slithered inside so easily and scored on
taller players so effortlessly that he was nicknamed the Abuser.
Anyone who tried to throttle Jamaal, you see, was eventually
abused.
</P>
<P>
   So, before Tinsley was even in high school, he was a playground
legend in Bedford Stuyvesant and was expected to be the next great
somebody. Tinsley was another slick point guard out of New York
City, another kid with a great handle, a great game and a great
nickname. How could this special player not make it to the big
time? The Abuser almost did not because he abused himself by not
caring enough about life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw some of my friends going to jail,'' Tinsley said. ``I
saw someone get shot and killed right there. I saw it all.
Sometimes it was scary. Sometimes, it was fun. At that time, that's
how I was. Seeing someone get hurt, like one of my friends, was
scary. But seeing someone shoot at us was fun. I escaped it.''
</P>
<P>
   Barely. Tinsley was sitting on a red and tan table in Iowa
State's locker room at the Metrodome during the Midwest Regional,
recounting the details and the detours that have seen someone who
never played a high school game miraculously develop into an NBA
prospect this season.
</P>
<P>
   Tinsley is a smooth playmaker who can dribble in the paint,
seemingly get lost for a second and then somehow flip the ball
through the basket. He burned Central Connecticut State for 26
points, six assists, six rebounds and four steals and is one player
Auburn must contain when the Tigers oppose Iowa State Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   As Tinsley recalled the road he navigated to go from playground
legend to high school dropout to neighborhood nomad to junior
college standout to a player who is one victory away from guiding a
team into the Sweet 16, he told the story with traces of pride and
depression. Tinsley knows how lucky he is. He was asked where he
might be if he had not reversed his routine of loitering on the
streets, and the 6-foot-3-inch junior kicked at his loosened
sneakers and shook his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd probably be in trouble somewhere,'' Tinsley said. ``I'd
probably be on the corner, a nobody, like some guys on the corner
right now who are nobody. It would have been hard for me. My life
would have been hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Leatrice Smith, Tinsley's mother, expects her apartment on
Clifton Place in Bed-Stuy to be filled with Jamaal's seven siblings
and more friends when the Cyclones play. She called her son's
turnaround a miracle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see this as a dream,'' Smith said. ``He could still be
standing on that corner, doing nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   During the four years Tinsley was supposed to be going to high
school, from Brooklyn to Cleveland, where he lived with relatives,
and back in New York, he estimated that he went to a full day of
classes for a total of 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd yell at him to go,'' Smith said. ``I couldn't get through
to him.''
</P>
<P>
   No one could. Tinsley's father, James Henderson, and his
mother's husband, Mitchell Smith, both died within four months of
each other when Tinsley was 6. With his two most significant male
role models gone, Tinsley said it was easier to disobey his mother.
He would hang with older men who did not care if he lacked
ambition.
</P>
<P>
   ``They weren't going to school,'' Tinsley said. ``All they did
was hang out.''
</P>
<P>
   Tinsley even spent one week at Manhattan Tombs Juvenile
Detention Center for his involvement in a robbery when he was 14.
While Tinsley said his friend committed the crime and he was a
bystander, even his mother is skeptical of his story. ``I don't
believe him,'' Smith said flatly.
</P>
<P>
   If Tinsley had not felt jealousy toward his teammates from the
Brooklyn Amateur Athletic Union team, he might still be chilling on
corners. But Tinsley saw that Stephon Marbury, Ed Cota, Jacquay
Walls and Allen Griffin were playing Division I. So, Tinsley earned
a high school equivalency diploma and went to Mt. San Jacinto
Community College, where he resuscitated himself.
</P>
<P>
   Tinsley was the California community college tri-player of the
year after averaging 21.6 points, 9.8 assists, 4.5 rebounds and two
steals a game as a sophomore. Then, at Iowa State, he was the Big
12's newcomer of the year, helping the team surge from a 15-15
record to 30-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm real happy because I knew I had it in me and I never gave
it a shot,'' he said. ``I have flashbacks. I'll be happy about
this, then I'm not happy. I know my life could have ended. But I
just kept hanging on.''

CONE WANTS IT KNOWN HE IS READY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ He has built a career on obstinacy, playing a
kid's game and competing with the pure willfulness of a child.
There will be runners on base, second and third and nobody out, and
it's as if David Cone folds his arms, locks his jaw and holds his
breath until he gets his way, until he gets out of the inning.
Never give in.
</P>
<P>
   So he has regrets now, at the way he gave in to his emotions at
the end of last season. He was angry with his manager and his
pitching coach, and for the first time he could remember, he gave
in to that fury in one tense meeting in Joe Torre's office. He was
bitter over the way the condition of his arm was being perceived
and portrayed by the Yankees and the news media. He was burned out.
</P>
<P>
   He believed his time with the Yankees was coming to an acrid
end. ``Thanks for saving my regular-season win with the Yankees,''
Cone told Mariano Rivera after beating Tampa Bay on the
next-to-last day of the regular season last fall, his playful tone
masking his disgust.
</P>
<P>
   He pitched once a week in the final five weeks of the season and
wasn't used in the three games of the first playoff series against
Texas. He gave in to ``the human element,'' Cone said last week.
``I didn't handle it very well. I let it get to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of that's ego and part of that is pride. But the last
thing I want to be perceived as is a once-a-week pitcher, or a
five- or six-inning pitcher. I still believe I can handle my
workload and pitch over 200 innings and be reliable.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone went 9-4 with a 2.86 ERA in the first half of the regular
season, and in his first start after the All-Star break he threw a
perfect game against the Montreal Expos, dropping to his knees with
his hands on his head, disbelieving, as Scott Brosius caught the
final out.
</P>
<P>
   But Cone won only one more decision in the next 10 weeks.
Sometimes he pitched well and received scant run support _ the
Yankees scored two runs or fewer in eight of Cone's 11 starts from
July 29 to Sept. 25 _ and occasionally Cone pitched badly. Always
there were questions about the condition of his arm, even as Cone
insisted he felt fine, much stronger than in 1998, when he faded.
</P>
<P>
   On the night of Aug. 24, the Texas Rangers pounded Cone for six
runs in 1 2/3 innings, and Cone readily acknowledged to reporters
afterward that he had had a bad game, that his stuff had been
lacking. When the nature of the questions changed to address a
larger issue _ was he falling apart? _ Cone's face reddened, his
anger barely contained, his responses clipped.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Torre and Mel Stottlemyre, who had been Cone's
pitching coach for years with the Mets and Yankees, summoned Cone
and initially informed him that he would be given a week off to
rest his arm. ``We know you are a warrior and you're going to say
you feel fine when you don't,'' Stottlemyre said.
</P>
<P>
   Cone was furious _ enraged that they would make that decision
without asking for his input, incensed they did not believe him
when he said he felt fine _ and he snapped at Stottlemyre, the
first time he could remember doing so. Cone insisted he was being
honest.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a growing sense last year that no one would believe
me,'' Cone said last week. ``I was kind of like the boy who cried
wolf. My reputation is that I'll pitch hurt, or I won't be
completely honest if my arm hurts. That can undermine the trust
factor between player and coaching staff. To me, that's important
and it always has been.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone, Torre and Stottlemyre ultimately agreed to a plan under
which Cone would pitch once a week, to give his arm extra rest for
the postseason, and Cone apologized for his outburst; he and Torre
agreed they could communicate better. Cone understood why they were
resting him: They wanted him as fresh as possible for the
postseason. But he fumed at the implications of the decision,
because it fed directly into the media's conventional wisdom that
he was wearing down, that he couldn't handle a full workload. ``I
can understand where he was coming from,'' Stottlemyre said.
``Maybe we could've been more sensitive to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone commiserated often with Chili Davis, the veteran designated
hitter, who had decided to retire, the two of them sitting in a
back room, Cone sharing his bitterness with Davis. As the playoffs
began and Cone waited for his turn to pitch, Davis suggested he put
his feelings aside and concentrate on enjoying each day.
</P>
<P>
   And this is what Cone did, beating the Red Sox in Game 2 of the
American League Championship Series with nine strikeouts in seven
innings, holding Atlanta to one hit in seven innings, reminding
himself to savor each moment. He and Davis lingered in a remote
corner of the clubhouse after the Yankees swept the World Series;
Cone concluded he probably wouldn't pitch another game in
pinstripes.
</P>
<P>
   When the Yankees initially offered a one-year deal for a salary
along the lines of what Cone earned last year, he was unsure
whether their interest was legitimate or whether he was politely
being pushed out. What Cone did not know was that in a staff
meeting in early November, two of the Yankees' most prominent
scouts _ Gene Michael and Lin Garrett _ had argued strongly to keep
Cone. ``He will always give you everything he has,'' Michael said,
according to someone else in the room.
</P>
<P>
   So long as Cone was willing to sign for one year, general
manager Brian Cashman told him, they wanted him back, and once
Cashman began increasing his offers, Cone began to realize the
Yankees' interest was sincere.
</P>
<P>
   The questions about his arm persist, and intellectually, he
understands that they will continue through the end of his career.
Cone allowed three runs in two and two-thirds innings in his first
exhibition game this spring, and he again found himself fending off
questions about his durability, his ability to compete as a
frontline pitcher. He insisted at one point that he expects to
compete for the Cy Young Award this year; it was as if he was
trying to convince everybody he's OK.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it kind of got to me constantly being on the
defensive, having to defend my health,'' Cone said. ``I still feel
like I'm defending the second half of my season last year. I'm
still struggling with it. I should handle it better. I'm still
working on it. I shouldn't let those things affect me as much as it
did, because it's going to happen and there's nothing you can do
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   His fastball was 80-83 mph in his first outing of this spring,
82-85 mph in the second, and he reached 87 mph once. In his most
recent outing, his fastball repeatedly reached 87 mph, as it did
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Cone finished second in the league in ERA in 1999 and pitched
exceptionally in the postseason. At 37, he keeps telling everybody
he feels great. He gets the feeling few believe him, and he's
trying not to worry about that anymore, trying not to give in.

 &HT;    Eds: Content of story varies from budgeted version - focus here
is on federal agency assistance
 &HT;    Federal agencies help flood victims get back on their feet
 &HT;    By Bobby Burns
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, N.C. _ Federal agencies helping area flood victims
have significantly curtailed their presence but still are on the
job six months after Hurricane Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   FEMA and the U.S. Small Business Administration have closed
recovery centers, began wrapping up site inspections and ended a
167-day aid application period after four deadline extensions.
</P>
<P>
   During that time, the agencies responded to more than 87,000
requests for assistance and committed nearly $1 billion to help the
state rebuild from its worst natural disaster, officials said last
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vast majority of federal dollars has been committed. Now
it's up to the citizens to take those resources and utilize them,''
said John Copenhaver, Region VI director for the Federal Emergency
Management Agency.
</P>
<P>
   The agencies are in the process of distributing more than $434
million in SBA loans, nearly $160 million in grants and more than
$217 million in assistance to local governments.
</P>
<P>
   Together with state and private aid programs, the totals account
for a strong package to help flood victims back to their feet,
Copenhaver said.
</P>
<P>
   Many already have used the funds to relocate or begin repairs.
</P>
<P>
   About 57,000 structures were damaged statewide as a result of
the flooding, according to the latest figures from FEMA and the
state. Of those, 7,000 structures were destroyed and 17,000 were
left uninhabitable.
</P>
<P>
   More structures were damaged in Pitt County than anywhere, the
figures show. Structures flooded by water 5 feet or deeper numbered
781; water 2-5 feet flooded 2,826 structures; and 4,354 sustained
damage from less than 2 feet of water.
</P>
<P>
   Flooding affected fewer buildings in neighboring Edgecombe
County, but in some cases damage there was more severe. A total of
1,278 structures there were flooded by water greater than 5 feet
deep, for instance. Water 2-5 feet deep damaged 2,028 Edgecombe
structures.
</P>
<P>
   In Pitt County, 10,650 individuals and businesses applied for
aid, again more than in any other county. The federal government
committed $125 million to assist here, second only to Edgecombe's
$159 million.
</P>
<P>
   Such numbers bolster confidence that the agencies provided some
level of assistance to everyone who wanted it, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   A minority of flood victims may not have wanted the assistance
that FEMA had to offer, however, including 19,000 people who called
the agency's toll-free registration line but never returned
paperwork to apply for the low-interest SBA loans _ the first step
in obtaining any federal assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Those people likely did not want the obligation of repaying a
loan, officials said. A common complaint among flood victims about
the aid was that they needed a grant, not another loan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's a lame excuse quite frankly,'' said Eric
Tolbert, head of the N.C. Emergency Management Division.
</P>
<P>
   Between the SBA loan package and state supplements most flood
victims could refinance and reorganize debt and
</P>
<P>
   ``come out ahead,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials tried throughout the application period to convince
flood victims that with interest rates at 3 percent, SBA loan
packages in many cases were better even than the grants.
</P>
<P>
   Grants by themselves often did not provide enough funds to make
full repairs. Large enough loans could be obtained to pay off
existing debt, make repairs and reduce interest rates by several
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The loans also did not rely on tax funds, and there is some
question how large a burden taxpayers should have to shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   That's already reached $130 per person in North Carolina for
state-level assistance alone, Tolbert said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People should appreciate that. It's an unparalleled amount,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials now are shifting the bulk of their energies from
recovery to prevention, focusing on the purchase of about 8,000
homes that sit in the 100-year floodplain.
</P>
<P>
   The ensuing buyout of flood-damaged property is expected to be
the largest anywhere resulting from a single presidential disaster
declaration, including Midwest flooding of the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers are staggering,'' said Copenhaver. ``This is
historic.''
</P>
<P>
   More than $50 million has been set aside to purchase the
property, including close to 1,000 buildings in Pitt County.
</P>
<P>
   By September officials hope 50 to 75 percent of the property
will have been converted to green, open space. And in the long run
that green space will prevent similar damage when the next
Hurricane Floyd comes, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   It's unwise to believe that last year's storms and flooding
won't repeat themselves anytime soon, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality says it's happening here more than anywhere else''
Copenhaver said. ``And predictions for 2000 are that it will be
another above average year. So the reality is there's more
opportunity (for damage) to come.''

their athletes -- Ray Lewis included -- can't break ties with the

eliminate three or four players a year in the draft because of
character questions,'' a league source said. ``Now, it's 25 to 35.

SEASON OF ADJUSTMENTS FOR GORDON AND CREW 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By CHARLIE NOBLES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's still early in the NASCAR Winston Cup Series season, but
one of the sport's marquee drivers, Jeff Gordon, has been a
conspicuous also-ran thus far. Fact is, it has been nine races
since the three-time champion has had a top-five finish.
</P>
<P>
   The scary part for Gordon is that he is getting trounced at some
of the places where he normally has dominated. He went into the
season's initial race having won two of the last three Daytona
500s. He finished 34th, after developing an oil leak early. And at
Hampton, Ga., last week at the Cracker Barrel 500, where he had two
firsts and a third in the last five years, he came in ninth.
</P>
<P>
   As un-Gordon-like as it seems, that ninth place is his best
finish in four races. He is 17th in the point standings heading
into Sunday's race at Darlington, S.C. Bobby Labonte leads with
Mark Martin next and legendary Dale Earnhardt Sr. third. The
defending champion Dale Jarrett is sixth.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear that Gordon, 28, is still adjusting not only to a
new crew chief in Robbie Loomis _ hired in December _ but also to
driving a redesigned Chevrolet Monte Carlo. NASCAR veterans say
that it normally takes at least half a season for driver and crew
chief to get on the same wave length.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I'm not sure if I should step in where I used to
before,'' said Gordon, whose cohesion with his previous crew chief,
Ray Evernham, was exemplary _ producing 47 victories in five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``No doubt I had higher hopes than this. But you can't panic. We
want to run better, but we realize it's not going to happen
overnight. As competitive as it is in NASCAR, you can't afford to
have any little glitch, any little change in your program, and
expect to go out there and just win races.''
</P>
<P>
   Chevrolet came out with a redesigned Monte Carlo this year and
Gordon believes that is part of his slow start. He thinks the car's
``rear downforce problem'' makes it more difficult to keep the car
balanced through turns.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR officials last week offered an olive branch to all the
Chevy owners whom had been complaining about rules they felt
favored the Fords and Pontiacs. They allowed the Chevys to lower
their front air dam by 2 inches, making them more aerodynamically
balanced.
</P>
<P>
   A Chevy _ driven by Earnhardt _ proceeded to win the Cracker
Barrel 500, even if it was by less than 2 feet. So Gordon is
optimistic that better days are ahead for car No. 24.
</P>
<P>
   A source close to NASCAR said that Hendrick Motorsports, whom
Gordon drives for, has been experimenting thus far with new chassis
components ``to try and get an edge.'' Obviously they are still
experimenting, with Gordon off to the worst start of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Trickle Up for Foyt
</P>
<P>
   A.J. Foyt is in his first year of owning a Winston Cup series
team, but the legendary driver still cannot stand failure. After
not qualifying for three straight races with the rookie Mike Bliss,
Foyt has ordered a driver switch for this week's Darlington
qualifying. Dick Trickle, a 58-year-old known for his ability to
decipher engine problems, will drive the next two weeks for Foyt,
as he seeks to find out what is wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The move will be announced Friday. Bliss' return after that is
likely but uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   Remains of the Day
</P>
<P>
   Eight days after nearly dying in the inaugural Craftsman Truck
Series race at Daytona on Feb. 18, Geoffrey Bodine gazed upon the
mangled remains of his truck.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when it sunk in how close I was to being killed,'' said
Bodine, who sustained back and wrist injuries and numerous burns
and abrasions. ``If it hadn't been me in there and I just came in
and saw the remains of that wreck, I'd say that whoever was in
there got killed.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Lap
</P>
<P>
   The last word comes from Mike Skinner, without a victory in 114
Winston Cup series races: ``I'd crash my mom to win that first
race.''

REAL ESTATE: PREPARING IN CASE OF A STRIKE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JAY ROMANO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the next few weeks, the owners, managers and
residents of about 2,900 New York City buildings will begin
preparing for the possibility that the porters, superintendents,
elevator operators and other staff members who work in the lobbies,
basements, elevators and hallways of their buildings might soon be
walking and carrying signs on the sidewalks outside.
</P>
<P>
   On April 20, the three-year contract between owners of
residential buildings in Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens and Staten
Island and Local 32B-32J of the Service Employees International
Union expires. (The Bronx is covered by Local 32E.)
</P>
<P>
   And while strikes have often been averted _ only three of the
last eight contract renegotiations resulted in employees taking to
the picket lines _ representatives of the owners say that the only
way to approach the situation is to be adequately prepared.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most significant issue facing most buildings is keeping
the building habitable during a strike,'' said James F. Berg,
president of the Realty Advisory Board, the property owners'
bargaining organization. ``And the only way to keep the building
habitable is to maintain vital services.''
</P>
<P>
   Berg said that while his organization has no reason to believe
that a strike is more or less likely than in previous contract
years, the fact that the safety and security of hundreds of
thousands of residents could be put at risk if a strike occurs
makes it imperative for building owners and managers to prepare for
the worst.
</P>
<P>
   ``Negotiations pretty much always go down to the wire,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Berg said that while most of the 26,000 residential building
workers in Local 32B-32J could walk out if a contract agreement is
not reached, some workers will likely stay on the job even if there
is a strike.
</P>
<P>
   In many larger buildings, Berg said, the superintendent is not
covered by the same contract. In buildings with more than five
employees, the superintendent is considered a resident manager and
is usually bound by a separate contract that expires in June.
</P>
<P>
   However, Berg said, even though a superintendent may remain at
work in some buildings, the super should not be expected to take
over the striking employees' jobs. He said that superintendents who
continue working should be able to maintain the heating plant and
make emergency repairs.
</P>
<P>
   Most buildings, however, will have to do without even those
services if an agreement is not reached by the deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main issue most buildings will be dealing with during a
strike is the sense among residents that there's nobody downstairs
minding the store,'' said Arthur Davis, a Manhattan property
management consultant. ``Whether your building has one employee or
30, management has to have contingency plans in place to provide
residents with some peace of mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis said that the managing agent should ensure that the
building's mechanical systems _ including elevators, water heaters,
trash compactors and heating, ventilation and air conditioning _
are inspected in the next couple of weeks and repaired immediately
if defects are found.
</P>
<P>
   ``If something goes wrong during a strike, you might have a hard
time finding contractors who will cross the picket lines,'' he
said, adding that most union workers, including plumbers,
electricians and deliverers, are likely to refuse to enter the
building while a strike is in progress.
</P>
<P>
   Two other major issues are building security and garbage
disposal. ``Management has to decide, on a building-by-building
basis, whether there is a need for front-door security,'' said
Jeffrey Heidings, president of Siren Management, a Manhattan
property-management company. ``And if the decision is made to hire
a security guard, you have to do so well in advance of April 20 to
avoid the last-minute rush.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Heidings said that the last time building employees went on
strike _ in 1991 _ it was difficult to hire guards on short notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Manpower was very tight,'' he said, adding that it is
generally worthwhile to arrange with security firms to guarantee a
guard, even though one might not be necessary if a strike is
averted. ``Most companies will allow you to reserve guards in
advance. And if there's a cancellation, they'll only charge you for
one shift. That's a small amount to pay to ensure that someone will
be watching over the lobby.''
</P>
<P>
   Another consideration is trash disposal. ``We plan to give out
extra plastic bags to tenants and urge them to make sure all trash
is securely bagged,'' he said. ``Even if you're lucky enough to
have a superintendent remain on staff, he's going to be a one-man
show and he's going to need help from residents.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Ann Rothman, the executive director of the Council of New
York Cooperatives and Condominiums, said buildings should top off
heating-oil tanks before April 20 to avoid problems if fuel
deliveries are stopped by a picket line.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, she said, management should compile a list of every
person authorized to enter the building. ``This will be invaluable
to the security guard or the resident volunteers who will monitor
the front door during a strike,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   It is probably a good idea to sort the names of authorized
individuals into two lists, she said. The first should have the
names in alphabetical order, accompanied by apartment numbers. The
second should be compiled according to apartment number, with the
names of residents as well as sitters, housekeepers and others
authorized to enter when the residents are not home.
</P>
<P>
   Rothman said that residents should be notified when the
entrances will be locked or monitored by a guard and should be
provided with a key or building identification card.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, she said, building management should try to identify
elderly or disabled residents so that arrangements can be made for
other residents to provide needed assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Tips for residents and managers are in a booklet distributed by
the council to its members. Rothman said that building managers not
part of the council may buy the booklet for $5 by calling (212)
496-7400.

DEHERE, IN BERLIN, AWAITING THE CALL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ALAN MAIMON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ Released by the Indiana Pacers in November 1999, Terry
Dehere packed his bags for the Continental Basketball Association.
Two days after signing with the Idaho Stampede however, Dehere
called it quits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't like the atmosphere there,'' Dehere said. ``If I had
stayed, I would have gotten depressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Dehere returned to his Los Angeles home and spent his days bike
riding, working out and hoping a better offer would come along. In
December, Dehere's agent called to tell him that Alba Berlin, the
top team in the German Basketball League and one of the best in all
Europe, was interested in him.
</P>
<P>
   The six-year NBA journeyman with career averages of eight points
and three assists a game sat down to think. The European basketball
leagues, historically a refuge for exiled NBA players or for young
players who recognize that they will never make it in the NBA, was
not necessarily the logical choice for the 28-year-old Dehere.
</P>
<P>
   As a 6-foot-4-inch shooting guard, he had led Seton Hall to
three straight appearances in the National Collegiate Athletic
Association tournament from 1991 to '93. In his senior year, he
parlayed a consensus all-America season into a first-round
selection (13th overall) in the draft by the Los Angeles Clippers.
But that was 1993. This was late 1999, and Dehere was trying to
jump-start a stalled NBA career.
</P>
<P>
   Dehere was eager to get back on court. He put faith in the fact
that Berlin would better suit him than Boise ever could and decided
to give the German league a try.
</P>
<P>
   ``Financially, it was a no-brainer,'' Dehere said last week from
his Berlin apartment. ``A guy like me can make just as much money
over here as in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``And more importantly, I knew I would get the minutes and the
shots that I wouldn't get even if I caught on with a team in the
NBA right now.''
</P>
<P>
   On New Year's Eve 1999, Dehere signed a one-year contract with
Alba Berlin. He woke up in Berlin the next morning with bronchitis.
While Dehere convalesced, his new coach, Svetislav Pesic, publicly
questioned whether Dehere, who had not played in two months, was in
game shape. Once Dehere was healthy, he was faced with a new team
and a new system, and he had to learn fast. All in a foreign
language.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult, not speaking any German,'' Dehere said. ``I
try to judge what coach is saying by his facial expressions and
tone. But sometimes I can't tell if he is angry or just excited.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on Dehere's performance during his first month in Berlin,
Pesic was probably a little of both. In his role as sixth man,
Dehere occasionally dazzled but also showed a tendency to force
shots. On off days, Dehere found himself doing a lot of running in
the woods, a staple of Pesic's grueling training regimen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kind of workouts that go on in the NBA during training
camp last the whole season here,'' Dehere said. ``It got me back in
shape fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, starting in his second game of the season in place
of the injured former North Carolina Tar Heel Henrik Roedl, Dehere
exploded for 35 points in a German league game against Weissenfels.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his increasing point totals, Dehere's nonstop
verbal assaults on opposing players indicate that he is beginning
to feel at home in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't stopped trash talking just because I'm in Berlin,''
Dehere said, grinning. ``And the more shots you get, the more trash
you can talk. But I have to say, it is usually the other bench that
starts with me. They definitely see it as a challenge to play
against a guy with NBA experience.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Weissenfels game, Dehere began covering the wrong man, a
result of an hourlong Pesic tirade about the importance of defense
that deprived the team of seeing film to prepare for the game.
Dehere thought he had his man identified. Meanwhile, his true
responsibility was left open to sink a 3-pointer. An embarrassed
Dehere heard the taunts from the opposing bench. Then he dropped 35
points on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one gets angry about it, because it's all in fun,'' Dehere
said of the linguistic exchange. ``It gets me more into the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Away from the court Dehere has had a chance to recover from
culture shock. He often tunes in to taped-delay NBA games on German
television, and he keeps in touch by phone with friends like Malik
Sealy of the Minnesota Timberwolves out of St. John's and Seton
Hall Coach Tommy Amaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be the icing on the cake,'' he said, ``if I could
finish up my career with the New Jersey Nets.''

KRZYZEWSKI TRIES TO INSPIRE THE BLUE DEVILS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By BARRY JACOBS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. _ Just under two minutes remained in
top-seeded Duke's 82-55 defeat of Lamar in opening-round action in
the East Regional. Duke's starters, resting on the bench and done
for the night, sat together and watched the reserves go through
their paces at Joel Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly Mike Krzyzewski, the Blue Devils' head coach, strode
down the sideline and crouched in front of Shane Battier, Carlos
Boozer, Chris Carrawell, Nate James and Jason Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Krzyzewski then proceeded to tell them in firm tones that he was
disappointed in their uninspired effort on a night he had intended
for them to send the rest of the field a message about purpose,
passion and power.
</P>
<P>
   ``If tonight didn't shock your system and get you ready to play,
nothing will,'' Battier, a junior forward, said.
</P>
<P>
   The first test of whether their resolve has been quickened comes
Sunday afternoon when Duke (28-4) faces eighth-seeded Kansas
(24-9), an 81-77 overtime winner over No. 9 DePaul. That follows a
game between fourth-seeded Illinois (22-9) and No. 5 Florida
(25-7).
</P>
<P>
   The Illini, an at-large entrant from the Big Ten, dispatched No.
13 Pennsylvania, 68-58. Florida, an at-large team from the
Southeastern Conference, eliminated 12-seeded Butler, 69-68, in
overtime on a last-second lay-in by forward Mike Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Florida, is deep, talented and young, with eight underclassmen
among its top 10 players. The Gators rank among national leaders in
scoring (84.3 points a game) and field-goal accuracy (48.4
percent), their uptempo style fueled by full-court pressure that
forces 20 turnovers a game.
</P>
<P>
   Yet against a disciplined Butler team, Coach Billy Donovan's
squad showed unaccustomed maturity by playing solid half-court
defense and patient offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``They won a game that was really our style of game, our score
of the game,'' Barry Collier, the Butler coach, said.
</P>
<P>
   That experience should come in handy against a physical Illinois
team, which is coached by Lon Kruger, Donovan's predecessor at
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Illinois, which led the Big Ten in steals, turnover margin and
3-pointers made, is led by the guards Frank Williams and Cory
Bradford. Williams, a freshman, had a personal-best 21 points
against Penn.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas, making its 11 straight tournament appearance, was
likewise led in scoring by a perimeter player, Kenny Gregory, who
had 22 points against DePaul.
</P>
<P>
   The Jayhawks, an at-large pick from the Big 12, missed 11-of-21
free throws; often took ill-conceived shots and committed 19
turnovers, many unforced. Yet they rallied to force overtime, then
won after trailing by 6 points in the extra period.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boy, it's like a lot of these Duke teams in recent years;
they're just shooting the ball so extremely well from the
perimeter,'' DePaul Coach Pat Kennedy said. ``I think for Kansas to
have an effectiveness, they've got to get the ball down low, and
their post guys have got to answer.''

REAL ESTATE: JFK ENTERS THE ERA OF THE MEGATERMINAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID W. DUNLAP   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After years of failed promises and false starts, it
seems that there is a tunnel at the end of the tunnel at Kennedy
International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   The tunnel in question will run out to a new kind of building at
Kennedy: a midfield concourse that will substantially add to the
capacity of Terminal 8, a 57-gate giant for American Airlines that
will dwarf its predecessors. In January, workers began
disentangling utility lines around the 107-acre site, setting the
stage for a seven-year, $1.3 billion construction project.
</P>
<P>
   Across the field, in mid-February, the first passengers arrived
at the west concourse of the new International Air Terminal. The
structural framework of its vast departures and retail hall was
topped off three weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   And all around these construction sites, looking (and sprouting)
like mushrooms, are 326 columns for the AirTrain light-rail system
that will link the terminals to one another and to mass transit
stations in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Though Kennedy is still saddled with a well-earned reputation as
one of the least hospitable of the world's transportation hubs, the
early results of its $9 billion makeover have become remarkably
visible.
</P>
<P>
   None of this will untangle the politics. The Giuliani
administration wants to wrest control of Kennedy from the Port
Authority of New York and New Jersey, which runs the airport on a
lease from the city, as it has since opening day in 1948. The
authority says it has no intention of giving up control.
</P>
<P>
   But the squabbling has not visibly impeded the first significant
transformation of the airport since the Eisenhower era, when
Terminal City took form, giving each airline its own distinctive
architectural presence, rather like a collection of World's Fair
pavilions. ``They had their logic, and they had their time,'' said
Barry Abramowitz, the assistant director of the aviation capital
program at the Port Authority. ``We're now past that.''
</P>
<P>
   In their place will rise a ring of megaterminals, diaphanous
arenas with airfoil roof lines, connected to parking garages and
the elevated AirTrain stations.
</P>
<P>
   Terminal 1 opened in 1998 and now serves 11 airlines. It will be
eclipsed next year by the International Air Terminal, Terminal 4,
which will dominate the field until 2006, when American finishes
Terminal 8. That may be rivaled by a Delta Air Lines terminal next
to and perhaps linked with Terminal 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``Delta wants to make New York City one of its major terminals
and destinations in the eastern United States and is committed to
developing a very substantial project,'' said D. Kent Turner, a
senior principal in Hellmuth, Obata &AMP; Kassabaum, the architectural
firm that is working on plans for the area around Terminals 2 and
3.
</P>
<P>
   William Nicholas Bodouva &AMP; Associates, the architects for
Terminal 1, are working with United Airlines and the new airline
JetBlue on the area around Terminal 5 and Terminal 6, which they
share.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, British Airways is expanding and renovating
Terminal 7. The $220 million project, designed by Corgan
Associates, will add 83,000 square feet of space to the 30-year-old
structure, in part by extending the building forward and connecting
it to a new parking deck.
</P>
<P>
   In front of Terminal 7, construction crews are erecting one of
the elevated sections of guideway for the AirTrain system.
</P>
<P>
   The first 5.3-mile leg of AirTrain is to open in 2002 with
service from eight stations around Kennedy to and from the A train
stop at Howard Beach, Queens. By 2003, AirTrain is expected to
reach Jamaica, Queens, on an elevated guideway along the median of
the Van Wyck Expressway.
</P>
<P>
   AirTrain is being designed, built, operated and maintained for
the Port Authority by the AirRail Transit Consortium, led by
Bombardier Transportation of Canada and Skanska (U.S.A.), a unit of
the Swedish construction and development company. The architects
and engineers are STV Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Three years from now, travelers departing from Manhattan will be
able to reach Kennedy on the Long Island Rail Road or the subway,
transferring to AirTrain for a trip around the terminals.
Passengers bound for Terminal 4 will get off AirTrain in the
building itself, since it incorporates a station on the mezzanine.
</P>
<P>
   Ease of access is a common theme among the projects. As
concourses expand to serve ever-larger aircraft, ``Kennedy is going
to be a place of moving walkways,'' said Ted D. Kleiner, the
program director for the redevelopment of the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Travelers will increasingly find ticket counters set like
islands in the middle of check-in areas, rather than arrayed along
the back like a hurdle. Broad open spaces, skylights and glass
walls will delineate the travel paths _ first to the shopping
centers and then to the aircraft gates beyond _ even for those who
cannot read the signs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The structure will assist the passengers in wayfinding,'' said
Ashok Raiji, a principal in Ove Arup &AMP; Partners, the consulting
engineers on the International Air Terminal and the British Airways
projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see the tails of the aircraft sitting out there on the
apron,'' added Gregory Hodkinson, another principal at Arup.
</P>
<P>
   It is no coincidence that every new terminal seems to have a
swooping roof. ``We want big open spaces,'' Hodkinson said. ``If
you have that, an efficient form is the curve, because you can get
the arch action of the trusses. People are drawn by the shape of
the roof to get to the other side, which is just where we want them
to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Clear travel paths contribute to security, said Abramowitz of
the Port Authority. ``There's no place to hide without sticking out
like a sore thumb,'' he said. ``There's no reason for anyone to
dally.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless it is to shop. Stores and restaurants are proliferating
in the areas between check-in counters and departure gates.
``Retailing in the '60s was a modest convenience, not a product of
having to arrive two or three hours before a flight,'' Kleiner
said. ``Marketers have found an opportunity that's there to be
captured.''
</P>
<P>
   Terminals must grow vertically since real estate is such a
scarce resource at Kennedy. ``Ultimately, you run out of places to
park aircraft,'' Hodkinson said. The central terminal area is
bounded on the north, east and south by runways, including 13R-31L,
a 2.8-mile stretch that is the longest commercial runway in North
America and a formidable barrier to expansion.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Only on the west could a 40-acre building site be created for
American Airlines by realigning taxiways. But even there, much of
the new terminal will rise on the site of the old buildings, which
must remain in service while construction is under way.
</P>
<P>
   That is also the case at Terminal 4, which is being built in,
around and alongside the International Arrivals Building of 1957, a
process not unlike performing open-heart surgery on a patient who
is simultaneously running a marathon.
</P>
<P>
   The parabolic arch over the old arrivals hall has already been
demolished, as has the old west concourse, and the rest of the
structure will soon follow.
</P>
<P>
   The current Terminal 8, built by American in 1960, is doomed,
although the airline plans to salvage in some form the
317-foot-long abstract stained-glass facade by Robert Sowers.
Terminal 9 next door, built for United Airlines in 1959, will also
be razed.
</P>
<P>
   The Eastern terminal of 1959 was demolished to make way for
Terminal 1, which was developed by Air France, Japan Airlines,
Korean Air and Lufthansa German Airlines. Also high on the
endangered-species list are Terminal 6, by I.M. Pei &AMP; Partners, and
Terminal 3, the former Pan Am Worldport, an umbrellalike structure
designed by Tippetts-Abbett-McCarthy-Stratton, now TAMS
Consultants.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, when the dust clears, only one building may remain from
the original Terminal City complex at what was once Idlewild: Eero
Saarinen's TWA Flight Center of 1962, now called Terminal 5. Were
it not an internationally renowned architectural icon and a
designated landmark, there is little doubt that Terminal 5 _
woefully small and outdated _ would have been swept away, too.
</P>
<P>
   Kleiner said the Port Authority had ``accepted the challenge of
developing plans which would provide for keeping the most
well-known exterior visual image and interior spaces of the main
building.''
</P>
<P>
   Port Authority planners are not unmindful of Terminal City's
positive legacy. ``We are trying to recreate that whole verve and
excitement that you're entering the world's greatest gateway,''
said William R. DeCota, the director of the aviation department.
</P>
<P>
   The Giuliani administration believes that little good _ and not
enough revenue _ comes from the authority's stewardship of Kennedy
and La Guardia airports. ``They are two of the worst airports in
America, for large airports,'' Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said last
year. ``This is the worst form of a government bureaucracy that is
running something that should be run by private enterprise.''
</P>
<P>
   In January, four groups responded to the city's search for a
private operator to serve as a consultant until 2015 and then take
over management of the airports after the Port Authority's lease
expires.
</P>
<P>
   One respondent was the group that is now building Terminal 4, a
consortium composed of Schiphol U.S.A., the American subsidiary of
the Dutch company that runs Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam; LCOR, a
New York developer, and Lehman Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   Other responses came from BAA, the private successor to the
British Airport Authority, which operates 14 airports including
Heathrow and Indianapolis; Hochtief AirPort, a German company that
runs the Duesseldorf airport and is developing a new airport in
Athens, Greece, and the Zurich Airport company.
</P>
<P>
   ``The response reflects a very healthy appetite on the part of
the bidders to participate in the running of the airports and the
privatization of the airports,'' said Michael G. Carey, the
president of New York City Economic Development Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very excited about that,'' Carey said. ``It confirms
that we're going in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Not in the eyes of the Port Authority, which opposes wholesale
privatization, even though it has handed over many smaller
functions to private operators. ``The Port Authority has retained
control of all the common elements,'' DeCota said. ``We've operated
the airports, in the public interest, as a system.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People think the Port Authority is ignoring Kennedy, but $9
billion is real,'' DeCota said. According to the Port Authority,
about $5.1 billion is being spent on passenger terminals, $600
million on cargo terminals, $1.5 billion on AirTrain and $1.8
billion on runways, taxiways, roads, parking garages and utilities.
</P>
<P>
   And even as it excoriates the Port Authority, the Giuliani
administration has played a role in the redevelopment, most
recently by providing access for American Airlines to the
tax-exempt bond market, through the sale of $1.3 billion in bonds
issued by the city's Industrial Development Agency. Because
proceeds from a municipal bond are exempt from federal, state and
city taxes, they carry a lower interest rate, which makes them
attractive to borrowers.
</P>
<P>
   Given the uncertain nature of Kennedy's future, American has had
to negotiate one lease with the Port Authority and a ``mirror''
lease with New York City, guaranteeing that its terms of occupancy
would continue should the airport revert to municipal control in
2015 or earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The second lease is under review, said Gary J. Pelletier, the
project manager in the airline's corporate real estate department.
</P>
<P>
   But the work is already under way. The first challenge is to
move utility lines. This is not simply a matter of an electrical
conduit here and a gas pipe there, but of storm sewers 12 feet
wide. ``We're actually relocating culverts,'' Pelletier said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides its sheer volume _ at 2.2 million square feet it will be
almost 50 percent larger than Terminal 4 _ the American gateway
will also be distinctive in the layout of its concourses, which are
parallel to the roadway rather than perpendicular.
</P>
<P>
   The first two concourses will form the legs of an H whose
crossbar contains the arrivals area on the lower level and the
departures hall on the upper level. The third concourse will be an
island in the middle of the apron, reached by moving sidewalk
through a 420-foot-long tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   Given the height of the water table, about 6 or 7 feet below
grade, the tunnel has to be designed to withstand immersion and
also to defeat its natural buoyancy.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Construction of the midfield concourse will begin next year. Its
opening will permit demolition to proceed on the old buildings.
``At one point, you'll have one new and two existing terminals
running,'' said Edmund A. Narbutas, managing principal in the New
York office of Daniel, Mann, Johnson &AMP; Mendenhall, the architect
for Terminal 8.
</P>
<P>
   The midfield concourse is intended primarily for domestic
traffic, while the concourse closest to the roadway will serve the
commuter jets of American Eagle. The intermediate concourse will
have room for 10 Boeing 747-400s at one time. This will allow
American to accommodate its partners in the OneWorld Alliance, like
Finnair and Qantas, Pelletier said.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as three years ago, American intended to keep its
older terminals and to build a new center concourse at the midpoint
between them, where it had earlier built a connecting structure,
designed by Murphy/Jahn and engineered by Arup.
</P>
<P>
   That was the first project at Kennedy for Arup, one of a number
of architectural and engineering firms that are not widely known by
the general public but are very active and influential in airport
design.
</P>
<P>
   Arup has worked on some of the largest-scale airport-development
projects of the late 20th century, including Chek Lap Kok Airport
in Hong Kong and Kansai International Airport in Osaka, Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Ove Arup, a Danish engineer, founded the firm in London in
1946, focusing first on the reconstruction of Europe after World
War II. Arup attracted international attention in the early 1970s
for engineering the audacious Sydney Opera House, designed by Jorn
Utson. The firm now has nearly 6,000 employees in offices around
the world.
</P>
<P>
   It is associated on the Terminal 4 project with Skidmore, Owings
&AMP; Merrill and TAMS Consultants, which was also responsible for the
concept of the new American Airlines terminal, now being refined by
Daniel, Mann, Johnson &AMP; Mendenhall.
</P>
<P>
   Terminal 4 breaks the mold by extending far into the central
parking area, a suggestion made early on by Paul Fernandez, a Port
Authority architect, in part to preserve precious apron space for
airliners.
</P>
<P>
   Pushing the terminal forward allowed it to incorporate an
AirTrain station that is structurally independent from the building
that surrounds it. ``When you stand here, you won't feel the train
there,'' said Nancy Hamilton, a senior associate at Arup, as she
walked through what will be the customs checkpoint, directly under
the tracks.
</P>
<P>
   The arrivals hall extends under and beyond the elevated roadway
leading to the departures hall, meaning that travelers will be
greeted by a wall of glass rather than the underside of a viaduct.
But they will no longer be greeted by Alexander Calder's 40-foot
``Flight'' mobile, which used to hang in the International Arrivals
Building. That is to be moved upstairs.
</P>
<P>
   Vast as the terminal already is, it has been designed to permit
future enlargement. ``Who knows what's around the corner?'' said
Raiji of Arup. ``You have to build with flexibility in mind.''
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, Terminal 4 is a crazy-quilt hybrid of the new
and old. Although the project is not scheduled for completion until
May 2001, the spacious west concourse opened for service Feb. 11
with the arrival of an Air India flight.
</P>
<P>
   As a commercial real estate venture, Terminal 4 is competing for
tenants just as an office tower would. David A. Sigman, a senior
vice president of LCOR, said the developers expected to sign
seven-year leases next week with their first tenants: Sabena,
Swissair and TAP-Air Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   Terminal 1, which has been open since May 1998, has seven
tenants besides the airlines that built it. They are Air Afrique,
Austrian Airlines, Olympic Airways, Royal Air Maroc, Singapore
Airlines, Turkish Airlines and Virgin Atlantic Airways.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're happy to say we're the cream right now,'' said August F.
Vettorino of Terminal 1 Management Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Although it will end up as the smallest of the new passenger
buildings, Terminal 1 affords a preview of the future at Kennedy,
with four ticketing islands set into a spacious departures hall.
The passport-control area and the ``sterile'' corridor leading to
it are suffused with daylight.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a pleasant throwback to the days when observation
decks were the rage. The upstairs food court offers views out to
the taxiways and Runway 13R-31L. ``You can sit and look out
airside,'' Kleiner said, as a Royal Air Maroc 747 pushed away from
the gate, ``which you haven't had a chance to do for many years.''

JOSEPH MARSHALL PARRIOTT, 79, INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER AND TEACHER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Calif., Colo.)  (mk) 
 By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joseph Marshall Parriott, the chief designer for a wide range of
objects including the stainless-steel Steam-O-Matic steam iron, the
WaterPik and a roomy and comfortable taxicab (which never went into
production), died last Sunday at the Bassett Hospital in
Cooperstown, N.Y. He was 79 and lived in Cooperstown.
</P>
<P>
   Parriott taught industrial design at Pratt Institute in
Brooklyn. His boxy-looking taxicab, designed by a
student-and-faculty team at the institute's School of Art and
Design, was only 2 inches longer than a Volkswagen Beetle but
provided more head and leg room for passengers than a Cadillac
limousine.
</P>
<P>
   When a full-scale mock-up of the vehicle was shown in 1971, a
spokesman for Pratt said that the project had been undertaken
because ``the modern taxi satisfies neither the passenger, the
driver nor the owner. It seems to satisfy only the manufacturers
and the junk dealers, and it accomplishes that feat in the short
space of two years.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael J. Lazar, then New York City's taxi commissioner,
praised the car as ``the kind of innovative design we are looking
for.'' But while greatly admired, ``Parriott's chariot'' never went
into production.
</P>
<P>
   Parriott was born in Moundsville, W. Va., on March 14, 1920, and
was raised in Colorado. He attended Colorado University and Pratt,
and during World War II served as a lieutenant with the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   In 1966, after working for a number of commercial enterprises,
Parriott became chairman of Pratt's industrial design department, a
post he held for 24 years.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, the former Mary Buckley, of
Cooperstown; a sister, Susan Parriott Grimm of La Jolla, Calif.;
and two brothers, Foster, of Boulder, Colo., and James, of Oxnard,
Calif.

DESPERATE TIMES: CITY WOOS TEACHERS TO A MERENGUE BEAT
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By KATHERINE E. FINKELSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Need can be a powerful force.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, it transformed a high school auditorium into
Fantasy Island, and the interim schools chancellor, Harold O. Levy,
into Ricardo Montalban, the casual proprietor in linen pants,
greeting wide-eyed guests.
</P>
<P>
   The heaps of fresh strawberries, a 14-piece merengue band and
offers of low-cost mortgages for the hundreds of prospective
teachers who came to a job fair held by the Board of Education
Saturday pointed to a looming problem: the city needs to fill about
54,000 teaching slots within five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you all for coming,'' Levy told applicants as they
streamed from the auditorium of Stuyvesant High School in Manhattan
after listening to a 90-minute sales pitch. ``Hope you find
something you like,'' he added, with a manner more suited to a
dinner party host than a desperate city official.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only two hours of lectures. It gets better now. Now,'' he said
with a winning smile, ``it's recess.''
</P>
<P>
   The band then broke into song and the applicants were treated to
a buffet of cantaloupe and muffins where principals lurked,
offering jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The job fair was the latest effort to address a potentially
crippling teacher shortage. A recent survey by the city's teachers'
union, the United Federation of Teachers, found that about 14,000
of the city's 78,000 public school teachers plan to retire over the
next 18 months. The union estimates that the system will need to
hire 54,000 teachers in the next five years. In addition, more than
300,000 children may have to attend summer school in a few months,
and the city may have to recruit more than 16,000 teachers for the
summer program.
</P>
<P>
   Given the size of the need, food and music were a modest start.
Recently, Levy proposed giving $1,500 in cash bonuses to every
certified teacher who agreed to work over the summer, and
round-trip airline tickets to anywhere in the United States to
summer school teachers whose students met certain improvement
goals.
</P>
<P>
   While Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani attacked the ticket offer as a
costly gimmick that all city workers might demand, the suggestion
underscored the city's desperation. This month, the city approved
an emergency amendment to allow teachers who are credentialed in
other states to teach in New York City, even before they have
passed certification exams.
</P>
<P>
   At the job fair, Levy focused less on the teacher shortage,
which he called ``terrible,'' and more on ``the auditorium full of
eager young people here to devote themselves to a special
calling.''
</P>
<P>
   Young applicants milled about, clutching their resumes and Kate
Spade handbags, jobs unfolding before them. Principals waited for
them, with plates of mints and Tootsie Rolls, to pitch their
schools as homey and safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wonderful place to be,'' Linda Falcon, principal of the
Luis Llorens Torres Children's Academy, just north of Yankee
Stadium in the Bronx, told David Kampel, a social worker
considering a midcareer job change.
</P>
<P>
   Falcon nodded kindly as Kampel laid out his strategies for
keeping unruly students in line and reducing classroom rules to the
most important ones, like: keep silent.
</P>
<P>
   At the next table, Danielle Haug, 21, who has a degree in
special education from New York University, got a job offer for
$32,000 a year on the spot from the Don Pedro Albizu Campos School
in West Harlem. ``If you're committed to us, we're committed to
you,'' the principal, Barbara Brown, told her. ``We are looking for
teachers who are really energized.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown characterized one of the central difficulties of keeping
good teachers in the system by adding, ``We could waste our time
training you for two years, then you want to go to Scarsdale and
take our training with you.''
</P>
<P>
   At another table, Charles Majors, principal of Middle College
High School in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, flattered a soft-spoken,
almost inaudible applicant. ``You sound like a risk taker to me,''
he offered, inviting him to visit the school.
</P>
<P>
   The balance of power was hardly lost on young applicants. ``It's
nice to come and get these types of responses,'' said Dianne
Alonso, who was seeking a job that would be within walking distance
of her home in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want you,'' she said, adding: ``It feels like a shift.
They're selling it as a quality environment.''
</P>
<P>
   And for Roseanne Wahl, 21, the draw was neither a low-cost
mortgage nor the ideal of shaping future generations. It was simply
the vast number of openings the city has, she said while filling
out an application.
</P>
<P>
   Her friend Jeanette Orlic, also 21, agreed. ``I need a job,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Flanked by reporters, Levy seemed to revel in the turnout. ``A
corporate recruiting effort would not have been better,'' he said.
``We would not have had the merengue band.''

UCONN FACES CLEMSON, WHICH SEEKS AN UPSET 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   STORRS, Conn. _ Connecticut Coach Geno Auriemma has not quite
forgotten the experience. Ten years ago Clemson upset UConn, 61-59,
in the second round of the East Regional of the National Collegiate
Athletic Association tournament at Gampel Pavilion. It was the
second loss the Huskies had endured on their new court _ they began
to play at Gampel that season _ and it is one of only 15 defeats
the UConn women have incurred there against 158 victories.
</P>
<P>
   Auriemma and UConn evened the score a year later in the NCAA
tournament with a three-point triumph over Clemson at the Palestra
in Philadelphia in the championship game of the East Regional en
route to the Final Four. That leaves the two teams tied at 1-1
going into Sunday night's second-round matchup in the East regional
tournament at Gampel Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, top-ranked Connecticut, 31-1 and seeded first
in the East Regional, will be an even stronger favorite over
ninth-seeded Clemson, 19-11, which finished with a 9-7 record in
the strong Atlantic Coast Conference and was one of five ACC teams
selected for the national tournament. Clemson, which lost four of
its last six games, gained the matchup by beating eighth-seeded
Drake, 64-50, while Connecticut crushed 16th-seeded Hampton,
116-45, on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   But Auriemma and the first-team all-Americans Shea Ralph and
Svetlana Abrosimova, in particular, vividly recall how UConn barely
averted an upset in last year's second round at Gampel before
edging lightly regarded Xavier, 86-84. The Huskies then lost to
Iowa State in the Round of 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've showed them tapes of that game over and over, and both
Shea and Svet know how bad they played,'' Auriemma said, with Ralph
and Abrosimova nodding as they sat alongside in the post-game news
conference Friday. ``But I don't think we'll see any repeat of that
Sunday, since we're a little more mature.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, with three starters over 6 feet tall _ Hampton had none _
Clemson presents a far more athletic and skilled opponent than
vastly overmatched Hampton, which was 13-14 during the regular
season. With a swarming defense that is similar to UConn's, Clemson
has limited opponents to an average of 59 points per game, only
five points more than Connecticut's defensive average.
</P>
<P>
   But the Tigers' shooting average is only 39 percent, as against
UConn's 53.5. And where Connecticut has a 13-1 record against
top-25 teams this season, Clemson is 2-6.
</P>
<P>
   The two teams have had only one common opponent, 14th-ranked Old
Dominion. In the Coaches Cancer Classic in Hartford last November,
the Tigers lost to Old Dominion by 11 points, after which the
Huskies routed Old Dominion by 43 points.

FOR KNIGHT AND THE HOOSIERS, ANOTHER SHORT STAY IN TOWN
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ Bob Knight is taking his Indiana Hoosiers home
early again. In recent years, this has become traditional at the
NCAA basketball tournament, as predictable as mascots, cheerleaders
and pep bands.
</P>
<P>
   Although Knight's teams have won three championships in his 29
seasons at Bloomington, the last one came in 1987. Against
Pepperdine on Friday night in the Hoosiers' opener in the East, his
team was embarrassed, 77-57, as an 11th-seeded team beat his a
sixth-seeded squad.
</P>
<P>
   Blunt as always, Knight said: ``We just got beat badly. We just
got pounded.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons was the absence of Kirk Haston, Indiana's
starting center, who played only two minutes in the first half and
left with a knee sprain after scoring two points.
</P>
<P>
   Haston averaged 15.8 points this season, second on the team, and
was the rebound leader with an average of 8.6. But A.J. Guyton, who
entered the team with an average of 20.3 points a game, was
healthy. He played 34 minutes, but only scored three points, all on
free throws. He was 0 for 2 from the field, both 3-point attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did a great job defensing me,'' Guyton said. ``It seemed
like they were a step quicker than us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hoosiers fell to 20-9. The Waves, 25-8, advanced to the
second round on Sunday and will play Oklahoma State, which trounced
Hofstra, 86-66.
</P>
<P>
   The game was the last for Hofstra guard Speedy Claxton, who
finished with 20 points and sustained a dislocated finger. Desmond
Mason, a 6-foot-5-inch senior forward, finished with 30 points for
the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   In the other bracket in the East Regional, Seton Hall will play
Temple. The Pirates, seeded 10th, upset seventh-seeded Oregon by
72-71 on an overtime layup by Shaheen Holloway, who dribbled the
length of the court through Ducks defenders and banked the ball off
the backboard with 1.9 seconds remaining. Holloway led all scorers
with 27 points.
</P>
<P>
   Temple, seeded second in the East and favored at this site,
ousted 15th-seeded Lafayette,73-47, behind 17 points from Quincy
Wadley. The winners of Sunday's two games will advance to next
weekend's four-team regional finals in Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   The Indiana-Pepperdine game began at 10 p.m., one of several
things that irked Knight this week. The leading scorers for
Pepperdine were Brandon Armstrong with 22 points and Nick Sheppard
with 17.
</P>
<P>
   In the days before the game, Knight was the subject of a
television report that alleged he had choked a former player three
years ago. Knight kept his temper under control Friday night, on
the bench and in the post-game news conference The Hoosiers also
lost their last two games of the regular season in the Big Ten.
Knight seemed to agree with a suggestion that Guyton was fatigued
from too much of a work load.
</P>
<P>
   It was the 15th consecutive appearance in the tournament for the
Hoosiers and the fourth time in the last six years that they have
been eliminated in the first game.
</P>
<P>
   During that span, the Hoosiers are 2-6. Knight last took the
Hoosiers to the Final Four in 1992, losing to Duke in the
semifinals. His NCAA tournament record over 29 years is 42-21.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about Indiana's early exits in recent years, Knight
said, ``We haven't been real good.''
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine, coached by Jan van Breda Kolff, offers a retro look
in terms of appearance. In an era in which many players shave the
hair from their heads, several Waves players sport Afros with
headbands, similar to the look of some athletes in the 1970s _
Artis Gilmore, for instance, or the early edition of Julius Erving.
</P>
<P>
   For Friday night, at least, the Waves played a quick,
entertaining style that seemed to leave the Hoosiers flat-footed
and gaping.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think it would be an athletic mismatch,'' van Breda
Kolff said. ``I don't think we thought our athleticism was going to
intimidate them by any means. But I think the way we play is a
little bit different than the Big Ten teams. Our presses and our
half-court traps are a little bit different than maybe what
Michigan State does. Our style of play was maybe different than
what they see on a game-in and game-out basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone asked Michael Lewis of Indiana a leading question,
noting that the Waves seemed to have fun playing basketball. Is it
important to have fun? Do the Hoosiers have fun?
</P>
<P>
   ``We have fun playing the game,'' Lewis said. ``If you're trying
to say `Does coach take the fun away out of the game for us?' You
know, he doesn't.''

REAL ESTATE: BALTIMORE RETURNING TO ITS ROW HOUSE ROOTS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Md., Mich.)   (jw) 
 By CHARLES BELFOURE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE, Md. _ For the second time, Baltimore has turned to
its architectural roots to rebuild its public housing. A high-rise
superblock that wiped out a row-house neighborhood in the 1950s has
been razed and replaced with a newly appreciated Baltimore fixture,
row houses.
</P>
<P>
   The Terraces, with 303 row houses built at a cost of $60
million, has taken the place of Lexington Terrace, five 11-story
towers with a total of 677 apartments. The 18-acre complex opened
in 1959 and was demolished in 1996. Along with the new row houses,
a four-story building with 88 apartments for the elderly has also
been constructed, plus an office building with retail space on the
ground floor. The site is on the western edge of downtown, across
Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard from the University of Maryland's
Baltimore campus.
</P>
<P>
   Lexington Terrace was one of the most crime-ridden and
deteriorated housing projects in the city, and when it was
demolished, only about half of its apartments were occupied. Along
with five other city projects, it became a symbol for a failed
housing policy that was championed by planners and architects in
the years immediately after World War II. They favored mostly
high-rise buildings on one gigantic block physically isolated from
the rest of the community, not traditional attached houses.
</P>
<P>
   John Torti of Torti, Gallas &AMP; Partners CHK of Silver Spring,
Md., whose firm designed the Terraces row houses with TLBC Inc., a
Baltimore architectural firm, said: ``It's a big repudiation of
modernist planning. We again understand the value of streets and
row houses, with their front doors and stoops.''
</P>
<P>
   The Terraces is part of the Department of Housing and Urban
Development's Hope VI program. Its goal is to demolish or
rehabilitate troubled buildings, replacing them with housing that
includes people of all incomes.
</P>
<P>
   The first Hope VI project in Baltimore was Pleasant View
Gardens, with 228 row houses completed in 1998. It replaced
Lafayette Courts, a high-rise project. ``A definite goal is to
blend the new housing into the surrounding community,'' said Elinor
Bacon, the deputy assistant secretary for public housing
investments at HUD. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Terraces achieves this effect by using many of the design
elements of Baltimore's traditional row houses, like brick facades
and porches. ``I recently brought a group of people through the
site, and their first reaction was that it doesn't look like public
housing,'' said Daniel P. Henson III, a former commissioner of
Baltimore's Department of Housing and Community Development.
Henson, who left his position in December when a new mayor took
office, is widely given credit as the driving force behind the
success of the city's Hope VI projects.
</P>
<P>
   Another important design decision for the Terraces was restoring
the streets once cut off by the superblock. Now, Saratoga, Vine and
Lexington streets run through the neighborhood again.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 303 row houses, 100 were earmarked for sale at market
rates, and the rest as rental units for low-income families. But in
design, the two are virtually indistinguishable. ``I dare anyone to
tell which are which,'' said Torti, who is working on 22 other Hope
VI projects across the country. The goal, he explained, was not to
stigmatize public housing.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the only difference between the units is that the ones
for sale have basements. All but 14 are two stories, with a total
of 1,240 square feet containing three bedrooms and two baths. The
14 three-story houses have a fourth bedroom. All of the houses have
central air-conditioning, washers and dryers and built-in computer
desks, and all are wired for high-speed Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   The 100 houses offered for sale were completed last year, and
all sold in less than 12 months for $60,000 to $70,000. The
remaining 203 houses _ appliances are being installed in the last
of them now _ have been leased at rents averaging $300 a month. A
majority of the rents are subsidized by the Baltimore Housing
Authority. All the houses have fenced rear yards that lead to
alleys, another traditional part of the Baltimore streetscape. The
alleys, by request of the tenant groups who participated in the
design process, have locked gates at both ends to prevent strangers
from coming through.
</P>
<P>
   Financing for the Terraces came from a variety of sources: $20
million of the project's $60 million cost came from the federal
Hope VI program. A joint venture team of Struever Bros. Eccles &AMP;
Rouse, a Baltimore developer, and Mid-City Financial Inc./Edgewood
Management, a Baltimore company that specializes in affordable
multifamily housing, won the competition to develop the site in
September 1995. They completed the project using private mortgage
money, state financing and tax credits for putting up low-income
rental and elderly housing.
</P>
<P>
   ``An objective of Hope VI is to develop these sites through a
public-private partnership,'' said Carl William Struever, the
president of Struever Bros. Eccles &AMP; Rouse.
</P>
<P>
   Bank of America provided financing for the 42,000-square-foot
office building, the Parren J. Mitchell Business Center, the first
of its kind in any Hope VI development. Sharing the same parking
lot is a stand-alone 11,000-square-foot store, which is being
leased by Rite Aid.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Terraces is technically a city public-housing
project, it will be managed by two private companies, Edgewood
Management and Cooperative Services Inc., an Oak Park, Mich.,
company that specializes in housing for the elderly.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Directly north of the Terraces is what will become the third
site to be reconstructed, a vacant 15-acre parcel where the George
B. Murphy Homes and Emerson Julian Gardens were demolished in
August.
</P>
<P>
   At Heritage Crossing, as the new development will be known, 75
low-income rental houses will be built, along with 185 houses that
will be sold at market-rate prices of $70,000 to $90,000.

THE TRIBUNE CO. RETURNS, BUT TO A VASTLY CHANGED MEDIA TOWN
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ill., N.Y., N.J., Conn., Md., Pa., Fla.)   (jw) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In 1991, when the Tribune Co. of Chicago had its last
brush with newspapering in New York, before paying Robert Maxwell
$60 million to take over The Daily News and its intimidating
unions, the region's media life was simpler.
</P>
<P>
   Silicon Alley and America Online were in their infancy.
Satellite television broadcasting was for the rural West, not the
Upper East Side. News 12, the local news channel of Cablevision
Systems Corp., was available to perhaps 675,000 households in the
New York suburbs, not 3.3 million. There were more daily
newspapers, more locally owned newspapers and more newspaper
readers.
</P>
<P>
   But if there is one thing the Tribune Co. has shown in the last
decade, it is that it revels in media complexity, and, arguably,
handles it better than it handled New York's newspaper unions. So
Monday, when it announced its $6.45 billion merger with the Times
Mirror Co. _ owner of Newsday, the Long Island newspaper _ the
question immediately arose: now that it is back, what will it do?
</P>
<P>
   Asked last week about possible expansion in the New York area _
perhaps by buying still more newspapers here _ Jack Fuller, the
president of Tribune's publishing unit, said such speculation was
premature. Overall, he said, the deal to buy Times Mirror was a way
to further the company's goal of reaching larger audiences more
ways. And of reaching them with local news.
</P>
<P>
   Besides The Los Angeles Times, The Baltimore Sun, The Hartford
Courant and Newsday, Times Mirror owns The Morning Call in
Allentown, Pa., The Advocate in Stamford, Conn., and Greenwich
Time.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know,'' Fuller said, ``is that this positions us in that
world strongly to take advantage of the developments as they
emerge. That's what we're trying to do. What that means in the way
of ventures or alliances, it's not possible to predict.''
</P>
<P>
   But from newspapers to broadcasting _ Tribune has owned WPIX, a
Warner Brothers network affiliate, since its creation in 1947 _ to
cable television to sports broadcasting to the Internet, Tribune
will find new links and new possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention some old grudges. Most of Newsday's employees are
union members, represented by local 406 of the Graphic
Communications International Union. The local's president, George
Tedeschi, well remembers the bitter 1990 battle between Tribune and
the unions that represented workers at The Daily News, the
newspaper that Joseph Patterson, a member of Tribune's founding
family, created as a New York media powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wait-and-see situation,'' Tedeschi said last week.
``Let's hope the Tribune Co. is not coming in here trying to be the
villain. Let's hope they hope to come in and cooperate with the
union and employees to prosper, just the way Times Mirror was able
to prosper.'' He said that a multiyear contract for Newsday's
employees had about five years to run.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest question for Tribune is whether to try to crack the
New York City market with a print product. WPIX, which ranks fifth
among New York's six network-affiliated broadcast stations in prime
time evening hours, is a stealth power in the 7-to-9 morning slot _
the domain of NBC's ``Today Show'' and ABC's ``Good Morning
America'' _ where it ranked third in the most recent Nielsen
ratings. The prospects for improving that ranking are strong:
Tribune's KTLA station in Los Angeles is a close second in that
time slot with an all-news program, and its WGN station in Chicago
has become the No. 2 morning news program.
</P>
<P>
   The potential to lure audiences and advertisers with improved
broadcast-news performance is there. But can Tribune get back
newspaper readers in the city? Does it even want to?
</P>
<P>
   Newsday, the successor to the newspaper bought in 1939 as a
wedding present for Alicia Patterson _ Joseph Patterson's daughter
_ by her husband, Harry F. Guggenheim, has grown from a circulation
of 15,000 in 1940 to 575,000 today. Its household penetration rate
is the highest in the country: 53.8 percent daily and 63.7 percent
on Sunday, among 877,300 households in Nassau and Suffolk Counties.
</P>
<P>
   And ever since the demise of New York Newsday in 1995, the paper
has been sending tendrils back into Queens.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're doing in Queens is exactly what we've been doing
for several years: adding three, four and five reporters a year,''
said Anthony Marro, Newsday's editor. Among the Newsday journalists
responsible for New York news coverage, he said, are 25 reporters,
five assigning editors and some page designers. In addition, there
are financial and arts and entertainment reporters based in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to running a daily newspaper devoted to the
city, both Newsday and Tribune have been there and done that, and
it did not end well for either of them. Buying one of the existing
tabloids, The Daily News _ owned by Mortimer B. Zuckerman and Fred
Drasner _ or Rupert Murdoch's New York Post, does not seem to be an
option.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Zuckerman, who recently told his staff that his young daughter
would be the next publisher of The Daily News, said he expected
Newsday to continue its pursuit of Queens readers.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent figures available show that The News reached 16
percent of Queens households with its daily paper and 19.7 percent
on Sundays. Newsday reached about 13.1 percent daily and 14.9
percent Sunday, outselling The New York Times, which reached 7.1
percent daily and 8.9 percent Sunday. The New York Post, which like
The Times is strongest in Manhattan, trailed the pack in Queens,
with 5.71 percent daily and 5.8 percent penetration on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But in the city as a whole, Newsday is a relative pipsqueak,
with 3.4 percent daily penetration of 2.9 million households and
3.6 percent Sunday. So it is unlikely that Tribune will buy its way
into the five boroughs immediately, if ever, and it would be
expensive to accelerate the gradual assault on New York from the
Queens front.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps an equally attractive audience is one that Cablevision
commands on Long Island, in Southern Connecticut and in New Jersey
with its 24-hour local news channel, News 12.
</P>
<P>
   News is just one way to lure audiences. Sports can be even more
effective. Tribune owns the Chicago Cubs baseball team and its
broadcast rights. In New York, Cablevision, which itself is
one-third owned by AT&AMP;T, has an equivalent sports portfolio, owning
the New York Knicks, New York Rangers and Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Charles F. Dolan, Cablevision's chairman, hails synergy in the
same terms that Tribune executives use. And Dolan's company's forte
is fine-grained local news and sports, which is the foundation of
Tribune's multimedia efforts in Chicago and in Orlando, Fla. So
Cablevision is in some ways one of the most potent competitors or
partners for Tribune in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In northern New Jersey, where the print players are newspapers
like The Record in Hackensack, owned by the Borg family, and The
Star Ledger in Newark, News 12 is a major presence _ and it is also
a partnership. Cablevision jointly owns and manages the New Jersey
service with Newhouse, the parent company of The Newark Star
Ledger, whose journalists contribute to its programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are moving away from a specific platform,'' Dolan said.
``You are a newspaper and someone else is a broadcaster. Those
identities may be archaic. You are first and foremost a journalist,
and an expert in a particular area of coverage _ that's what's
ultimately important to a reader or viewer.''

FORWARDS, FOR A CHANGE, MAY DECIDE BOTH GAMES IN BIRMINGHAM
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIRMINGHAM, Ala. _ Though play in the NCA A tournament has been
guard-driven in recent years, size drives the four teams playing
Sunday in the South Regional.
</P>
<P>
   They are an unusual mix of towering, tenacious teams that play
the post. When Connecticut (25-9) plays Tennessee (25-6) and
Stanford (27-3) meets North Carolina (19-13) here at the
Birmingham-Jefferson Civic Center, what happens under the basket,
in the paint, could prove more crucial than what occurs on the
perimeter.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, guard play will be important, especially for Connecticut,
the defending champion. The Huskies will probably start Khalid
El-Amin at point guard. He suffered a sprained right ankle Friday
afternoon in their 75-67 victory over Utah State. But the question
of how effective and how long El-Amin can play on the sore ankle
makes Connecticut squirm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only have 48 hours to take care of it,'' El-Amin said. ``I
did some ultrasound and ice and I have a lot more treatment to go
through before the game. It's going to be a game-time decision.''
</P>
<P>
   It is an issue Connecticut must address since El-Amin is the
soul of the team's playmaking on both ends of the floor. If El-Amin
is unable to perform, Connecticut will turn to a couple of
freshman, first Tony Robertson and then to Marcus Cox, to
orchestrate its game plan.
</P>
<P>
   But equally important for Connecticut is defending the post,
where Tennessee features two 6-foot-8-inch players, C.J. Black and
the versatile, slashing Ron Slay, plus forward Isiah Victor (6-9)
and forward Vincent Yarbrough (6-7).
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut, in turn, gives Tennessee plenty to ponder in the
paint in center Jake Voskuhl (6-11) and forward Kevin Freeman
(6-7). Add the Huskies' center Soleymane Wane (6-11), forward Ajou
Deng (6-10) and forward Edward Saunders (6-8), and Tennessee will
find that rebounding, shot blocking and post points will heavily
decide the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   The same applies to Stanford and North Carolina, where the twin
Collins brothers, Jason and Jarron, both 6-11, tangle with North
Carolina center Brendan Haywood, who is 7 feet. Haywood was
dominating in a 28-point, 15-rebound output in the Tar Heels' 74-60
victory over Missouri, which was easily the best game of the season
for him and his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is standard in tournament play that the further you advance
that guard play rises to the top,'' said Tony Fuller, assistant
coach of Stanford. ``In those first-round games, higher seeded
teams are usually much bigger teams against little teams and the
size factor is so evident. But these games here on Sunday are going
to be odd because all four teams may start with the emphasis inside
more than outside. And it could finish that way, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Haywood, in particular, is on a mission.
</P>
<P>
   He is a junior who has been labeled as soft and easily winded, a
guy who has barely tapped his ability. He has heard enough of the
criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard people doubt me all of my life,'' Haywood said.
``When I was 13, nobody thought I'd get to this position in college
basketball. People think because you're big you're supposed to do
more than the average guy in basketball. I know I'm always the key
to other teams' defenses, but people don't think about that. I want
to get us to the Sweet 16 and see what people have to say about
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people don't expect me to play well against
Stanford's big guys because they have the big starters and then
more big guys coming off the bench. We'll see on Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Against Missouri, North Carolina made Haywood the focal point of
its attack. It plans to do the same against Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had an up-and-down season and I can see why people have
counted us out,'' said Tar Heels point guard Ed Cota. ``We haven't
played to our potential. But against Missouri everybody on our team
played their roles, got the ball to Brendan and didn't worry about
getting credit or how their stats looked. We've put the selfish
play behind us, and that is Carolina basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanford features balance inside and out, but its inside players
_ especially the Collins brothers and forward Mark Madsen, who is
6-9 _ are flexible and powerful players full of presence.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Collins kept the focus on Haywood. ``I've been playing
against Brendan for a long time in high school and AAU games,'' he
said. ``He is physical and likes to work low. He likes the short
jumper and hook and to rebound and put the ball back. I have to
push him up the lane more. I have to make him work harder for his
shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut wants to push Black out of the middle, too, and keep
Slay from creating opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tennessee has athletic guys in the post,'' Saunders said.
``But we play good team defense and I think we are more athletic
than them. We're going to have to battle them hard for 40 minutes
and establish the post as ours. It's hard work down there with
little glamour. But it's where these games will be won.''

 &HT;    National Felony League
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Two of the NFL's top stars say Baltimore Ravens
linebacker Ray Lewis violated one of the basic ``entourage'' rules
on Jan. 31, when he shuffled passengers into his limo and left a
crime scene in Buckhead.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to surround yourself with people who want to
accomplish what you're looking to do,'' said Falcons running back
Jamal Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   ``And you have to talk with them before you go out,'' said
Terrell Davis, running back for the Denver Broncos, ``and tell
them, `If something goes down, we walk away.'''
</P>
<P>
   For the National Football League, that's been an
easier-said-than-done.
</P>
<P>
   When Lewis left Buckhead hours after Super Bowl XXXIV, two men
lay dead in the street from multiple stab wounds. Lewis and two
friends, both with serious criminal backgrounds, were arrested on
charges of murder.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second murder charge against an active NFL player _
there have been three in league history _ in three months. In
November, Carolina Panthers receiver Rae Carruth was charged with
murder in the slaying of Cherica Adams, 24, his pregnant
girlfriend. Police say Carruth plotted Adams' shooting with two
acquaintances who had histories of criminal activity.
</P>
<P>
   The Carruth and Lewis incidents sandwiched a string of serious
charges against NFL players and their associates. While the
transgressions shocked the nation, they have not been surprising to
those close to the league.
</P>
<P>
   NFL officials say they realize that the new generation of
athlete, made instantly rich on draft day, is creating serious
problems. Many come from impoverished backgrounds and won't, or
cannot, break ties with the streets. Some players have entourages
that include convicted felons and gang members.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each NFL franchise has a responsibility to try to understand
who they're bringing into their locker room,'' said Dr. Harry
Edwards, a sociologist at the University of California who works
with the San Francisco 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What these teams are really doing is blindly mixing chemicals.
It may end up that they're producing diamonds and gold by winning
Super Bowls. But they also could have the whole thing blow up in
their faces.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless we get on top of it, we're going to see bombs going off
everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Some think it might be the biggest challenge the league has ever
faced. Although the NFL maintains its crime numbers are dropping,
commissioner Paul Tagliabue and players union head Gene Upshaw met
with several players in New York two weeks ago to discuss
off-the-field conduct. Tagliabue is expected to address the
violence issue during a meeting with the league's 32 owners later
this month in Palm Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, the NFL resembles a crime-laden mine field.
Carolina running back Fred Lane was arrested in Jackson, Tenn., on
drugs and weapons charges. Earlier, Indianapolis Colts defensive
back Steve Muhammad was charged with battery in the beating of his
pregnant wife, who died in November from labor complications
brought on by injuries suffered in a car accident. Miami Dolphins
running back Cecil Collins was charged with fondling women in two
separate incidents, and his probation was revoked in his native
Louisiana. And Arizona Cardinals running back Mario Bates was
arrested last week on charges of slapping his girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't have this kind of thing,'' Kansas City Chiefs owner
Lamar Hunt said. ``We want to be able to focus on football. We want
to concentrate on the draft and minicamps and some of those kinds
of things.... I can't recall anything quite like what has been
happening off the field lately. We must find a way to stop it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue, NFL commissioner since 1989, has expelled one player
from the league for off-the-field violence. Former Eagles offensive
lineman Kevin Allen served 33 months in jail for a 1990 rape, and
his request for reinstatement later was denied by Tagliabue.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the NFL instituted an anti-crime policy for off-field
charges, but the punishment often was light. The first year the
players were disciplined with counseling, then fines.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the recent transgressions creating a public-relations
nightmare, Tagliabue seems to be taking a tougher stance. Last
week, the NFL disciplined four players _ three offensive linemen
who were involved in a fight outside a bar last summer and a
Tennessee Titans defensive back who pleaded guilty to assaulting
the mother of his son.
</P>
<P>
   Three players _ Matt O'Dwyer of the Bengals, Jumbo Elliott of
the Jets and Denard Walker of the Titans _ were suspended two games
this season; Jason Fabini of the Jets was fined $14,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an organization whose continued success depends on
integrity and public confidence, the NFL simply cannot tolerate
conduct that victimizes other individuals and results in a loss of
respect for NFL players,'' Tagliabue said. ``We are raising the
disciplinary standard in order to underscore that this type of
behavior won't be tolerated.''
</P>
<P>
   But the league seems to be looking the other way in some cases.
Last month, Kansas City Chiefs receiver Tamarick Vanover pleaded
guilty to the felony charge of aiding and abetting the sale of a
stolen vehicle that crossed state lines. Vanover, who remains on
the team's active roster, is cooperating as a witness in a federal
drug and car-theft investigation that has left 23 people charged
and 10 convicted. Former Chiefs running back Bam Morris also has
been mentioned in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory E. Burns, whom authorities identified as Vanover's
personal assistant, is facing federal drug-trafficking, weapons and
car-theft charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``What worries me league-wide is the hanger-on crowd,'' Chiefs
coach Gunther Cunningham said. ``It is an issue the league, and we
as an organization, will address and look at carefully. If our
players go down to the local gym to play basketball and `Joe Smith'
shows up, well, who is Joe Smith? The team as a whole has to stand
guard for each other.''
</P>
<P>
   LEAGUE'S CHECKS NOT ENOUGH
</P>
<P>
   The league and its teams hire psychologists and security
personnel to conduct extensive background checks of its players.
The NFL also stages several programs for its players, ranging from
financial planning and postcareer counseling to dealing with anger
control, domestic violence, sexual responsibility and substance
abuse.
</P>
<P>
   But the NFL can't control who is riding in the passenger seats
of players' cars, sleeping in their spare bedrooms or sharing in
their newfound wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, one of the nation's leading sociologists, and other
experts attribute some of the off-field problems to causes ranging
from an increasingly violent society to many athletes coming from
crime-infested neighborhoods and impoverished backgrounds. Big
money also is an issue _ the average NFL salary in 1998 was $1
million _ and some players aren't prepared for the wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, who in 1998 signed a four-year contract worth $26
million, will be tried with longtime friends Joseph Sweeting, 34,
and Reginald Oakley, 31. Sweeting has served prison time for
burglary and numerous weapons charges. Oakley has beencharged with
assaulting a police officer, trafficking cocaine and shooting into
an occupied dwelling.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Ray Lewis) was trained to be a great athlete,'' Cleveland
Browns owner Al Lerner said. ``He was never trained to be a
multimillionaire. He was never trained to handle that kind of
exposure and the things that got shoved in front of him. How many
times do we remember walking away from an incident and it was good
that we did? These kids may not know enough about just walking
away.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards said the biggest factor in off-field violence may be a
player's background and the team's ability to deal with it. NFL
scouts say that in years past, there were serious character
questions about three or four athletes in each draft. Some years,
that number has increased to more than two dozen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to do a better job of screening and profiling and
understanding the baggage involved with some of the personnel we're
bringing into the league,'' Edwards said. ``We're not a social work
organization whose mandate is to save souls. But we're dealing with
human beings, and that carries with it a responsibility to
professionally understand who these players are. ... Negative
associates can be family members. We've got players in the NFL who
have family members in jail. We've got players who have family
members on death row. You can't pull a person out of a network of
associates that is so deeply embedded.''
</P>
<P>
   NFL running back Darick Holmes, who last season played for the
Colts, has said that gang members helped pay for his education at
Portland State. His brother, Karl, was convicted of a gang-related
murder and is on death row in San Quentin State Prison in
California.
</P>
<P>
   Darick Holmes, who at age 15 spent 10 months in youth camp for
selling marijuana, has remained out of trouble during his five-year
NFL career.
</P>
<P>
   OLD TIES THAT BIND
</P>
<P>
   ``People say the (gangs) pick you, you don't pick them,'' Holmes
told the Buffalo News in 1996. ``But you can make your own
decisions, even though you grow up right there. You're tempted to
join. I had my chances where I could have joined. I might have
hustled, trying to make some money gambling, but other than that I
wasn't going to join.''
</P>
<P>
   Other NFL players have struggled to break the ties. Wide
receiver Charles Jordan, who spent last season with the Green Bay
Packers, grew up on the streets of Los Angeles. He was a gang
member of the Bloods, whose rivals were the Crips.
</P>
<P>
   As a teenager, Jordan was accused of _ but never convicted of _
armed robbery, drug dealing, driving a stolen vehicle and carrying
a concealed weapon. When he was 19, Jordan and two other members of
his gang were arrested in connection with the murder of a Crip.
Jordan refused to give police the name of the shooter, and after
spending five months in jail, he was released.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, signed as a free agent by Los Angeles Raiders in 1993,
has had a lackluster six-year career in the NFL. But he has grabbed
plenty of headlines for off-field trouble. During an interview with
ESPN in 1997, Jordan admitted sending part of his salary to gang
members in California.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, who says he severed his gang ties after the birth of his
first child in 1992, was cut by the Miami Dolphins in February
1999. He was released after being charged with two felonies related
to accusations of fighting with police outside a bar in Fort
Lauderdale, Fla. Before the Packers cut him earlier this year,
Jordan was charged with obstruction and paid a $5,000 fine for
lying to police about a traffic accident involving teammate Antonio
Freeman in Green Bay, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   Law-enforcement officials say gangs are such a widespread
epidemic that it would be naive to think that the problem hasn't
infected the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gangs are a trend that is sweeping the country,'' said Wes
Daily Jr., president of the National Alliance of Gang Investigators
Association. ``Why wouldn't you expect to see them in sports? Not
all of these kids are wild, war-torn and poor. Some of them
graduate from high school and go to college. They do go into sports
and corporate America, but they still keep their alliances in the
gang.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards: ``Anytime that you have a society that has the growing
gang problem that America has, and you're tapping into that youth,
you're going to have a gang problem. I don't think gangs are an
overwhelming problem for the NFL. Is it there? Sure, it's there. Is
the league concerned? Yes. But is it something that could topple
the league over? No.''
</P>
<P>
   According to NFL statistics, the number of players who were
investigated by law enforcement for violent crimes decreased from a
total of 50 _ from more than 2,000 players _ in 1997 to 37
investigations in 1999. The league also said convictions for
violent crimes also dropped, from 23 in 1997 to nine in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Some gang experts contend that problems start at the college
level, where schools recruit student-athletes with questionable
pasts and expect them to change overnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're recruiting ball players. They don't care if they're
gang members or not,'' said Wes McBride of the Los Angeles County
Sheriff's Department, a past president of the Gang Investigators
Association. ``That's the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Oliver Lucas was the head coach at Pomona (Calif.) High School
in 1984 when then-coach Bill McCartney approached him about joining
his staff at the University of Colorado. The Buffaloes were coming
off a 4-7 record in 1983, and McCartney knew he had to turn the
program around quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Let's see how we can get some of these inner-city
kids,''' said Lucas, now a coach at Adams City High School in
Colorado. ``Florida and Florida State made a living recruiting
those kids. He wanted to go for the quick fix and that was the
inner-city kids.''
</P>
<P>
   With Lucas recruiting talent-rich California, the Buffaloes
signed future NFL players Eric Bieniemy, Deon Figures and Charles
Johnson, among others. Bienemy, now a free-agent running back, and
Figures, a cornerback with the Jaguars, have both acknowledged past
gang ties. Both have been model NFL players.
</P>
<P>
   With those players leading the way, Colorado shared the national
championship with Georgia Tech in 1990. Lucas was fired after the
following season.
</P>
<P>
   Daily, a detective with the Suffolk County Police Department in
New York, says some coaches ignore obvious warning signs because of
the pressures to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wrong expectation to think you can take a kid out of a
community ravaged by gangs, put a psychologist in front of him and
change him,'' Daily said. ``It's too deep. Gangs don't consider
themselves as gangs. They consider themselves as an organization or
family. Some people grow up and get out of that environment, but
others don't. It's gotten a lot of athletes in trouble because they
haven't separated themselves from their friends, who still
associate with the gangs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a saying on the street, `Once a member, always a
member. Once a gangster, always a gangster.' Now that these
athletes have hit it big, their friends are coming up to them,
saying, `Hey, help us out. You're big now.' And some of those guys
don't walk away.''

 &HT;    Salary cap restricts leadership
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Stringent salary-cap rules and free agency are among
the root causes of off-the-field violence committed by NFL players,
says one of the nation's leading sociologists.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Harry Edwards, a professor of sociology at the University of
California, contends the league's salary-cap rules, which were
introduced in 1993 to bring more parity to pro football, are
depriving locker rooms of much-needed leadership. Edwards, who has
served as a consultant for the San Francisco 49ers since 1985, says
free agency strips teams of veterans, who often serve as role
models and mentors for younger players.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have a situation where Thurman Thomas, Bruce Smith
and Andre Reed all are leaving the Buffalo Bills in one day, or a
Jerry Rice, Tim McDonald and Steve Young might leave the San
Francisco 49ers because of the salary cap and free agency, you
undermine the leadership, chemistry and structure of the locker
room,'' Edwards said. ``There's no continuity. There's no
significant core of tradition that the younger players can connect
with. Now, the younger players are going to connect with younger
guys, who most likely were college teammates that didn't make it to
the NFL, or their friends from the 'hood.''
</P>
<P>
   According to figures from the NFL Players Association, more than
120 free agents signed with new teams before last season. This
year, more than 100 players already have signed with new teams,
including former Bills defensive end Smith, running back Thomas and
receiver Reed, who were released by Buffalo for financial reasons.
</P>
<P>
   As teams scurried to get under the $62.172 million salary cap by
the Feb. 10 deadline, veterans were some of the first players
released. Carolina cut linebacker Michael Barrow in a cost-cutting
move. Vikings offensive linemen Randall McDaniel and Jeff Christy
signed with the Buccaneers when Minnesota couldn't afford them, and
the Falcons did not re-sign defensive end Chuck Smith for financial
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards said Baltimore Ravens linebacker Ray Lewis, who goes on
trial in May on charges of murder in the Jan. 31 stabbings of two
men in Atlanta, might have lacked a veteran presence in the locker
room.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ravens stated that they were going to talk to Ray Lewis
about the people he was associating with,'' Edwards said. ``Well,
it's not a one-time talk. It should be an ongoing discussion
between Ray Lewis and a veteran leader throughout the course of the
season.''
</P>
<P>
   After a recent meeting in New York to discuss off-field
violence, players union head Gene Upshaw said players favor more
player-to-player mentoring.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things players seemed to be saying over and over is
that one-on-one, player-to-player type of relationships should be
developed, probably better than we have,'' Upshaw said. ``There are
clear role models out there, and it's among our peers. There are
really good guys out there waiting for a call to help.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards said he prefers a system that would slot free agents on
each team. Under that plan, clubs would only count a certain
percentage of a veteran's salary against the cap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Free agency and the cap have definitely contributed to the
problems in sports,'' Edwards said. ``There has to be some system
where you can stabilize veteran players.''

 &HT;    NFL stars find it difficult to turn away pals
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Running backs Jamal Anderson of the Falcons and
Terrell Davis of the Denver Broncos are two of the biggest stars of
the National Football League.
</P>
<P>
   Both players have a large network of friends and associates, but
Anderson and Davis have managed to stay out of the police blotter
during their pro careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have an entourage as big as the best,'' Anderson said.
``But I'm not going to put myself in a situation that I might
regret.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis, the former University of Georgia player who was named the
NFL's Most Valuable Player in 1998, grew up in a tough neighborhood
in San Diego. One of his brothers served 5 1/2 years in prison for
shooting a pregnant woman during a robbery. Davis said his best
friend was murdered. But Davis escaped the streets through
football.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're growing up as a kid, there are a lot of
opportunities to get into trouble. I got into trouble as a kid,''
Davis said. ``I think when you've grown up and you have friends
that you've known since you were 5 or 6, and you're in the position
you're in with all the money and stature, it's hard to distance
yourself from them.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to change. But you've got to explain it to your
friends before you go out. You tell them, `Look, if something goes
down, we walk away.'''
</P>
<P>
   Davis said one of his biggest concerns is that some of his
friends think they're his bodyguards.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are overprotective,'' he said. ``I've got
friends who think they're watching my back. If they think I'm not
in the mood to talk, they'll push someone away. That can start an
altercation right there.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been easier for Anderson, who grew up around celebrity.
While Anderson was growing up near Los Angeles, his father was a
bodyguard for Muhammad Ali, Sugar Ray Leonard, Diana Ross, Arsenio
Hall and Richard Pryor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all have friends who have done things that we're not proud
of,'' Anderson said. ``You've just got to prioritize what you're
trying to get done in your life. I was raised to know that I should
surround myself with people who wanted to accomplish what you're
looking to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got some friends who are screw-ups. It's a tough
situation. Everyone is telling you not to change, so you don't want
to quit associating with the people you've known your entire life.
But you also don't want to have friends who can get you into
trouble. It's a different ball to handle. It's tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City Chiefs tight end Tony Gonzalez said it's easier said
than done for players to disassociate themselves with friends they
grew up with.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to realize these players have grown up with those
guys since they were little kids,'' Gonzalez said. ``You can tell
them to change, but it's hard to do. These are the people who were
there before you became who you are today.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to tell someone like that, `Hey, I can't hang out
with you anymore. Even though you've been with me my whole life,
now I can't talk to you anymore.' I mean, that's a hard position to
be in.''

DENTIST IS INVESTIGATED AFTER BOY'S LEG IS BROKEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MARIA NEWMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yeni Rivero said she always had a slightly uneasy feeling when
she was told she could not accompany her 5-year-old son, Mario,
into the treatment room when they visited the Children's Dental
Center in Union City, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, when an assistant called her into the treatment
room, that unease was borne out: She found her son with a broken
leg that she believed was caused by the dentist, Dr. Kevin P. Ward.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son was pale white and crying, and he told me, `Mommy, I
can't walk,''' Rivero said Friday in a telephone interview from her
North Bergen home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dentist explained to me that my son was struggling, and
that he had begun to kick his legs in the air and had kicked him in
the head,'' she said. ``He told me, `I pressed down on his leg, and
I heard his bone snap.'''
</P>
<P>
   Mario Rivero has a broken right femur, and has a cast on his
entire right leg, part of his left leg and halfway up his chest,
his mother said.
</P>
<P>
   Ward, 42, did not respond to telephone messages left at his
office Thursday and Friday; neither did his lawyer, Vincent
Loughlin.
</P>
<P>
   The Hudson County prosecutor's office has started a criminal
investigation. As a result of reports of Mario Rivero's injury,
Ward is no longer practicing at two other offices, in Vernon and in
Maywood, where he worked one day a week. But even as the state's
Department of Consumer Affairs, which oversees the board that
licenses dentists, reviews the matter, Ward continues to practice
at Children's Dental Center in Union City, where he now works most
of the week.
</P>
<P>
   Since Mario's injury, Hudson County prosecutors said they had
learned that Ward was sued in January by the family of an
8-year-old girl who said he broke her wrist while she was having a
tooth pulled in his Vernon office several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   And state officials said Ward had his license suspended for a
year in 1987 after a child under anesthesia died in his office.
During a state hearing in that case, Ward admitted to ``a
significant error in professional judgment,'' according to a
transcript.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey Board of Dentistry prohibited him from using
general anesthesia unless he completed 60 hours of course work, but
he failed to do this, according to Jennifer Salvato, a spokeswoman
for the Division of Consumer Affairs. Ward is still allowed to
administer local anesthetics.
</P>
<P>
   Salvato said the 1987 suspension was the only action the
consumer affairs office had taken against Ward during his 16-year
career in New Jersey. No criminal charges have been brought against
him.
</P>
<P>
   In light of the Rivero matter, the consumer affairs office is
reviewing Ward's license, Salvato said.
</P>
<P>
   Edward DeFazio, the deputy first assistant Hudson County
prosecutor, said it might be difficult to bring criminal charges
against Ward for Mario Rivero's injuries because the only witness
against him is a 5-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is denying there was a fracture of the child's leg, and
that it apparently occurred when he was being treated by the
dentist,'' DeFazio said. ``The question is: Is there sufficient
indication of intent to make it a criminal case? Under the law,
negligence is not sufficient state of mind for an aggravated
assault.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The lawsuit against Ward in January was filed by Cathy
Caliendieri of Rockaway Township for a 1996 incident in which her
daughter, Amanda Schwab, then 4, went to his Vernon office to have
a tooth pulled and emerged with a broken wrist.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my first and last visit to him,'' she said. ``I was
told that I was not allowed in the room. That was their policy. Who
was I to argue with the doctor?''
</P>
<P>
   When Ward emerged from the treatment room with Amanda, the girl
said he had hurt her arm, her mother said. Caliendieri said Ward
told her, ``We had a little problem,'' and explained that Amanda
would not hold still, so he had to hold her down.
</P>
<P>
   She said police officials who questioned Ward told her that they
would not file criminal charges, because they concluded that the
child's injuries were the result of an accident.
</P>
<P>
   In Mario Rivero's case, his mother said that when Ward told her
he had had to restrain her son, the dentist did not seem very
concerned, even when he explained that he had heard Mario's bone
snap. ``He said that at that time my son stopped stirring, so he
finished the procedure on him,'' Rivera said. ``I almost passed out
when he explained that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to him: `How could you continue working on him? Why
didn't you call me or come and get me?''' she said. ``He didn't
answer me.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she wanted to call an ambulance, and Ward told her she
should have her own pediatrician examine the boy. Instead, Rivero
said, she used her cell phone to call her husband to the office,
and they called 911. ``Dr. Ward never said, `I'm sorry.' He never
offered us the use of his telephone.''
</P>
<P>
   After she contacted 911, the police were sent to the dentist's
office along with an ambulance, she said.
</P>
<P>
   It was during the police officers' questioning of Ward, Rivera
said, that she learned he had worked on the wrong tooth. She said
that her son was struggling because he was trying to tell the
dentist.
</P>
<P>
   Now Rivero, like Caliendieri, thinks she should have gone into
the treatment room with her son. There are no regulations governing
whether doctors and dentists must allow the parents of minors into
the treatment room.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't come out,'' Rivero said of Ward. ``His policy is
that kids go in and they're taken care of. He doesn't come out and
explain anything to parents.''

ORANGEMEN MUDDLE ALONG, THEN SAVE BEST FOR LAST
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By LIZ ROBBINS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Preston Shumpert, his long black socks covering his
spindly legs, was alone in the corner at the baseline Sunday,
waiting patiently. His Syracuse teammate, Jason Hart, driving
through the lane, had a shot, but delivered it instead to the
steady sixth man on a designed play.
</P>
<P>
   When the ball came to Shumpert, he launched it with confidence
and rhythm, breaking a 50-50 tie with only 36.8 seconds remaining
in a seesaw affair against Kentucky. That last shot proved enough
to send Syracuse (26-5) to the Round of 16 for the first time in
three years and sent Kentucky (23-10) home to Lexington.
</P>
<P>
   ``From shooting lots of shots, it's just repetition,'' Shumpert
said of his long-range accuracy, especially under pressure. ``It
all feels the same. I just shot it and it went up.''
</P>
<P>
   And when Kentucky's Tayshaun Prince fell to the floor as his
fadeaway last-second jumper missed the mark, it was, fittingly,
Shumpert who got the rebound.
</P>
<P>
   Shumpert then sent the ball straight up into the cool
Convocation Center air, more than 60 feet up. He led the Orangemen
with 12 points in their satisfying 52-50 victory over Kentucky. He
was the only Syracuse player in double figures on a dismal shooting
afternoon in which Syracuse shot only 31.7 percent and Kentucky
40.5. In the end, Shumpert decided the sloppy contest with the
cleanest of shots.
</P>
<P>
   The game was still in doubt with 10.7 seconds remaining. At that
point, Kentucky coach Tubby Smith called back-to-back timeouts,
with nine seconds left on the shot clock and the Wildcats still
trailing, 52-50. Then Syracuse called another timeout.
</P>
<P>
   Returning to the court, the Kentucky freshman Keith Bogans
missed a runner on the baseline and Prince's 3-point follow shot
fell flat.
</P>
<P>
   Until then it seemed that Souleymane Camara, a 6-11 Kentucky
sophomore who averaged only seven points a game this season, might
turn out to be the player of the game. He had a blocked shot and
two consecutive thundering dunks in the final three minutes, tying
the score at 50-50.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams carried their banners proudly into the game. Kentucky
had seven national championships to boast, as well as the best
all-time record in college basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Syracuse had two runners-up trophies but believed the past
experience was not as important as the present. As it turned out,
the three senior Orangemen _ Hart, Ryan Blackwell and Etan Thomas _
did not contribute as much as the sophomore sixth man.
</P>
<P>
   Blackwell gave his team a 48-45 advantage with 3:57 to play.
Eleven seconds later, Syracuse took a severe blow when Thomas left
the game with five fouls. With him went an intimidating presence in
the middle. But the Wildcats could not capitalize.
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky's lone senior starter was Jamaal Magloire, a 6-10
center who made an aborted attempt at playing in the NBA this past
summer until he decided he would improve his marketability by
staying at Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's better for it and we're better for it,'' Smith said. ``We
both got as much as possible from his return.''
</P>
<P>
   In the second half, Magloire ignited the Wildcats by scoring
eight points and keeping the teams close. Then Prince, his
sophomore teammate, who was the hero of the first-round
double-overtime victory over St. Bonaventure, scored eight straight
to give Kentucky a 42-40 lead with nine minutes remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams played frantic defense throughout the first half,
forcing bad shots and a combined total of 19 turnovers, setting the
tone for a sloppy affair between two evenly matched teams.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the chilly Convocation Center, Syracuse shot an anemic 29
percent from the floor in the first half, Kentucky 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The anticipated matchup between the senior centers, Thomas and
Magloire, did not produce many offensive highlights in the first
half, but Thomas proved why he had 102 blocked shots during the
season to Magloire's 54. With six minutes remaining in the first
half, Thomas stuffed Saul Smith on a pull-up jumper, blocking it so
resoundingly that the ball bounced higher than twice Smith's 6-1
height.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all timing, that's all,'' Thomas said with a shrug before
the game.
</P>
<P>
   His timing could not have been better. Though Syracuse failed to
capitalize on its next possession, Thomas had another block the
next time down the court. That seemed to jump-start the Orangemen's
surge toward the end of the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Until that point, Syracuse had gone nearly 11 minutes without a
field goal, yet never trailed by more than six points.
</P>
<P>
   DeShaun Williams connected on Syracuse's first 3-pointer of the
game with 3:27 remaining in the half to bring the Orange within a
basket, 18-16. Then Shumpert, in a preview of things to come,
knocked down another jumper 3-pointer to give Syracuse its first
lead in over seven minutes.

ST. JOSEPH'S DEFENSE A CONCERN FOR RUTGERS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   PISCATAWAY, N.J. _ Before Rutgers eliminated Holy Cross, 91-70,
Friday night in the National Collegiate Athletic Association
women's tournament here, the Scarlet Knights' Shawnetta Stewart
watched the first half of the opener between St. Joseph's and
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart's mind was on her own upcoming game, but she noticed
enough to draw a conclusion. Tenth-seeded St. Joseph's was on its
way to a 69-48 victory, holding the seventh-seeded Longhorns to
their second-lowest point total of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know they're going to be a test,'' Stewart said of the
Hawks, the Scarlet Knights' second-round opponent here on Sunday in
the West Regional. The winner will advance to the round of 16 in
Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   The Scarlet Knights (23-7) were to watch film of the Hawks
(25-5) Saturday. They will find a disciplined team that adjusts its
zone defense to its opponent and is patient on offense. St.
Joseph's allows 53 points a game, the second-lowest average in the
nation. The Hawks rely on center Jana Lichnerova (14 points and
seven rebounds a game) and forward Susan Moran (16.4 points, seven
rebounds) for most of their points, and Angela Zampella (eight
assists a game) to get them the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Moran squirmed into the key for several short jumpers and layups
to score 24 points against Texas. ``I think we run our offense so
well that it looks like I get the ball a lot by chance,'' Moran
said.
</P>
<P>
   St. Joseph's has been scrimmaging against men to acclimate
itself to the physical play of the tournament, and the Hawks will
likely get a healthy dose of it from the Scarlet Knights.
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers outrebounded Holy Cross, 42-25, and slashed through
screens to shut down the Crusaders' star, Anna Kinne, during a 24-4
second-half run after Kinne had scored 19 points in the first.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had 10 turnovers, and we outrebounded them,'' Stewart said,
``and those were the two key things that coach Stringer wanted us
to do well on.''

ASSAULT CHARGES PUT FOCUS ON PARENTS' BEHAVIOR AT YOUTH HOCKEY
GAMES
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By COREY KILGANNON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After 38 straight losses, the 10- and 11-year-old
members of the Staten Island Sharks ice hockey team finally had
something to cheer about: a hard-fought 3-2 victory on Jan. 23.
</P>
<P>
   The game was also a moment of jubilation for the players'
parents, who spend thousands of dollars for equipment and league
fees and anxiously study their children every second they are on
the ice.
</P>
<P>
   But one parent was angry. Matteo Picca, whose son Steven plays
forward, grabbed his son's two sticks from the bench at the War
Memorial Rink and confronted the coach, Louis Aiani. The argument
grew heated. According to the Staten Island district attorney's
office, Picca rammed the coach in the face with the sticks in what
the hockey world calls a cross check, breaking his nose and causing
facial injuries requiring stitches.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say that Picca was upset that his 10-year-old son
remained on the bench during the final minutes of the game, while
Aiani kept his better players on the ice. Picca has maintained that
his complaint had been about the coach's win-at-all-costs attitude.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing testimony from parents, coaches and league
officials, a grand jury indicted Picca on Tuesday on charges of
second-degree assault and fourth-degree criminal possession of a
weapon. He is scheduled to be arraigned in state Supreme Court on
Staten Island this Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors called the attack ``one of the worst examples of
parents acting overly aggressive and irresponsible with regard to
their child's athletic activities.''
</P>
<P>
   In interviews last week, parents, coaches and league officials
on Staten Island, where ice hockey's popularity has surged in
recent years, could not recall any other time that a parent had
physically attacked a coach.
</P>
<P>
   Most agreed, however, that the incident illustrated that parents
were quicker to lose control at their children's games. Maybe, one
joked, there should be a separate penalty box for parents.
</P>
<P>
   While the phenomenon of parents behaving badly is present in
most junior league sports, it is particularly noticeable in ice
hockey. Parents often pay thousands of dollars per season to
register and outfit their children, and drive them to practices and
games early in the morning and late at night. So the amount of time
the coach allows the child to take center stage on the ice is at a
premium, and closely monitored by parents.
</P>
<P>
   Hockey teams usually have at least three five-player units that
alternate on the ice at the coach's discretion. First-string
players tend to play longer shifts than second- and third-string
players.
</P>
<P>
   Also, fierce rooting, sometimes bloodthirsty, can get parents
into altercations with referees, coaches and one another. Unlike
many other sports, where parents of opposing teams sit separately,
many hockey rinks, including the two on Staten Island, have no
spectator seating, so parents of children from both teams usually
stand at the edge of the ice, near the benches for the players and
coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``You talk to any coach on Staten Island, and he'll tell you
that the perfect rink would be one without parents,'' said Loretta
Giamboi, secretary for the six hockey teams at Monsignor Farrell
High School on Staten Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``The glass is around the rink but it should be around the
parents,'' Giamboi said. ``They yell things like `Get that guy,
take him down.' They're all playing through their kid.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks' league has banned Picca from attending games and
practices. After the incident, his two sons did not return to
league play for the rest of the season, which ended last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our policy is to give all kids equal playing time,'' said
Louis Wein, a senior vice president of the league, ``but you
frequently hear things like, `My kid missed two minutes this
period,' or, `He was only on the ice 32 seconds, and the other kid
got 47 seconds.' So if a coach keeps his best line in during the
last two minutes, does that warrant a physical assault?''
</P>
<P>
   Picca appeared with his son the ``Early Show'' on CBS on
Thursday morning to insist that he did not start the fight.
</P>
<P>
   His attorney, Nicholas Gravante Jr. of Manhattan, insisted
Friday that his client had approached Aiani only to complain that
his son had been verbally abused throughout the season. The fight
broke out, he said, ``only after the coach raised his hand first.''
Aiani's wounds were very likely caused by Picca's fists, Gravante
added, ``but if the coach was indeed hit by the sticks, it was
accidental, in the scuffle.''
</P>
<P>
   Gravante claimed that Steven Picca was frequently harassed
verbally by Aiani and would come home crying after hockey practice
``because this coach told him he stinks and was calling him a
moron.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This has nothing to do with playing time,'' he said, adding
that Aiani had a win-at-all-costs attitude at the Jan. 23 game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Vince Lombardi philosophy is not appropriate in junior
league hockey,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Aiani, 43, works for the New York City Board of Education as a
district supervisor, said his attorney, Michael E. McMahon, who
called the incident ``an indictment of parental misconduct.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a national issue, parents getting overly involved
emotionally in their kids' games, like every game's the Super
Bowl,'' he said. ``A guy bashes his son's coach in the face with a
hockey stick in front of children, and instead of apologizing, he
goes on national TV concocting some phony excuse.''
</P>
<P>
   At a hockey clinic at the War Memorial Rink last Thursday night,
fathers leaned over the boards cheering on their sons, many of whom
wore their family names on the back of their jerseys.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the kids that play, but some of these parents think
they're on the ice,'' said Andrzej Bajor, whose son Michael, 11,
plays defense in the Sharks' squirts division.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Jenine Fuca, whose twin boys, James and Nicholas, 16, play
hockey at Monsignor Farrell, added, ``They should let in the kids
and keep out the parents.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorothy Roses pays about $5,000 per year for her sons Brett, 9,
and Kirk, 10, to play hockey for the Sharks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no guarantee that these kids are going to get a lot of
ice time,'' she said. ``Parents should know that going in.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, Mark Schofield, from Middletown, N.J., watched his son,
Mark Jr., 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``Driving your kid three hours to a game, only to watch him sit
on the bench, while some other kid gets 15 minutes a period,'' he
said. ``That can build up psychologically over the course of a
season.''
</P>
<P>
   Dominick Volpe, the rink manager, said he regularly broke up
disputes between parents there.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a kid playing baseball, my father didn't even know
where I was,'' he said. ``Some of these parents these days are
ridiculous. It's bad enough the kids get pressure from their
coaches and friends.''

   TECH-FUTURE _ LOS ANGELES _ Americans participated in two great
migrations in the 20th century. First, they moved by the millions
from farms to cities, seeking jobs, and after World War II, they
moved again, this time from central cities to suburbs. In the new
century, yet another demographic pattern may emerge: immigrants and
young people will leave suburbs everywhere to find work in the
nation's booming high-tech clusters. Certain states, including
California, Texas, New York, Florida and Georgia, will get a surge
of growth from Asians, Hispanics and others seeking jobs, while the
majority will become relatively whiter, older and less prosperous.
Will we become, in essence, two countries, one old, white and
slow-growing and the other younger, multicultural and more
entrepreneurial? (Geewax, Cox News Service).

   TECH-FUTURE _ LOS ANGELES _ Americans participated in two great
migrations in the 20th century. First, they moved by the millions
from farms to cities, seeking jobs, and after World War II, they
moved again, this time from central cities to suburbs. In the new
century, yet another demographic pattern may emerge: immigrants and
young people will leave suburbs everywhere to find work in the
nation's booming high-tech clusters. Certain states, including
California, Texas, New York, Florida and Georgia, will get a surge
of growth from Asians, Hispanics and others seeking jobs, while the
majority will become relatively whiter, older and less prosperous.
Will we become, in essence, two countries, one old, white and
slow-growing and the other younger, multicultural and more
entrepreneurial? (Geewax, Cox News Service).

REAL ESTATE: COLUMBIA AND HIGH-TECH PARTNER DIVIDE AND CONQUER

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Columbia University's school of continuing education
and Eureka Broadband, a high-technology start-up, have agreed to
share space at 100 William St. in Lower Manhattan, in an unusual
arrangement that participating executives say will benefit both
parties.
</P>
<P>
   Paul M. McNeil, Columbia's associate dean for continuing
education, said the proliferation of dot-com companies and other
computer-driven industries has been good for the university, with
more workers seeking advanced training in programming and related
skills. Enrollment in the computer technology and applications
program has grown 25 percent in the last two years, and now it has
650 students.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't accommodate more growth in our existing labs
uptown,'' McNeil said. Since many of the prospective students work
downtown, he began looking for space in the area. But space
downtown, once cheap because of then-high vacancy rates, has become
more expensive as the vacancies have been filled. Rents for Class A
space in the area are now approaching $40 a square foot, according
to brokers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything I found,'' McNeil said, ``was out of my price
range.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if he could have afforded it, he simply did not like some
of the spaces he was shown. One was the basement of the building at
55 Broad St., the first in the downtown area to make major of use
technology as a marketing tool. ``One of the things we have to do
is create a mini-campus in the evenings,'' McNeil said. ``Two
underground rooms filled with computers do not say campus.''
</P>
<P>
   But the university had one advantage: it only needed the space
at night and on weekends. During business hours it would be
available if another user could be found that could take advantage
of a fully equipped computer laboratory during the day.
</P>
<P>
   That led to the deal with Eureka. The company, whose main
business is wiring buildings for high-speed access to the Internet,
also planned to get into the business of running conferences and
training sessions on using new technology. During the day the space
will be operated by Eureka at the Think Tank (at) 100 William and
rented for $2,000 to $15,000 a day, depending how much of the space
is used.
</P>
<P>
   Eureka, now a company with 160 employees, raised $22 million in
venture capital last October. But when the talks with Columbia
started in the summer of 1998, it was ``three men with a business
plan,'' said Robert W. Vanech, the president.
</P>
<P>
   Brought together by officials of the Alliance for Downtown New
York, Vanech and McNeil found they shared a common view of the use
of technology and a willingness to structure an unusual deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw a way to leverage Columbia's cash and wanted the
association with Columbia as a way to legitimize our business,''
Vanech said.
</P>
<P>
   The university provided $600,000 toward the $1.3 million cost of
building out the 13,000-square-foot second floor of the building.
In return, Eureka makes the space available to Columbia for an
average $22 a square foot over 10 years _ well below the market
rate.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement brings the university back to its roots
geographically. The William Street location, at the intersection
with John Street, is just a few blocks away from Trinity Church,
where the university was established in 1754 as King's College in
Trinity's schoolhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Columbia University downtown,'' McNeil said.
</P>
<P>
   But that is as far as nostalgia goes. Because of the connection
with Eureka, the space is thoroughly wired, with Internet
connections over very high capacity T-3 telephone lines.

   The space at 100 William St. presented a design challenge, since
it is shaped like a triangle around an atrium. Timothy Johnson, an
architect at NBBJ in New York who did the interior design, said it
apparently was originally considered to be retail space.
</P>
<P>
   Because of this, there is glass on both the exterior walls and
those facing the atrium, bringing in a lot of natural light and
permitting visual contact between people in different parts of the
space. ``It's an easy place to manage _ I can see everybody,'' said
Jenny Hess, the director of what Eureka calls ``new media
conferencing.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he tried to design a visual expression of the
technology incorporated in the space. As is the fashion with many
dot-com companies, all the cables run along exposed overhead racks.
The heating and cooling duct work is also exposed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything Eureka does is in a box or a wire,'' he said. ``We
wanted to give it a physical image, a place that looks as fast as
the technology.''
</P>
<P>
   A flat-panel display greets visitors at the entrance. During the
day it flashes a Eureka logo, but at night McNeil said it would be
used for academic messages, like class schedules.
</P>
<P>
   A closed ``R &AMP; D bubble'' stands to the left of the entrance.
This is used to house the latest data distribution equipment and to
direct visitors to the right, toward the combined Think Tank and
Columbia labs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is enough equipment in that bubble to light up a small
town,'' said Sang Lee, Eureka's vice president for technology,
referring to fiber-optic technology. He said the bubble contained
secure power supplies, telephone and data switches, equipment to
handle video conferences and devices to handle multiple messages on
fiber-optic lines. He said the Columbia labs use about a twentieth
of the equipment's capability.
</P>
<P>
   (Those who turn left anyway would end up in space occupied by
Eureka engineers, although that could change, given the pace of the
company's growth. ``We expect to keep doubling every 60 days,''
said Vanech, the company's president.)
</P>
<P>
   The space includes two computer labs where subjects like the
C(plus sign)(plus sign) programming language and software
development for electronic commerce are taught. Each is equipped
with 25 flat-screen Dell workstations and such aids as
ceiling-mounted liquid crystal display projectors and white drawing
boards connected to a network so hand-drawn images can be stored
electronically.
</P>
<P>
   The space also includes a lecture hall that can seat 75 people
and two conference rooms, one that accommodates 18 people and
another that accommodates 10; all incorporate visual displays.
There is an informal space where students can gather before or
after classes and a long hallway known as the ``e-bar.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``e-bar'' space faces the glass wall of the atrium and is
equipped with a long, narrow table and bar-style chairs. Like most
of the rest of the space, the ``e-bar'' is fully wired, so students
can plug in their laptop computers there and connect with the rest
of the wired world.
</P>
<P>
   Less visible, but just as essential, is the additional
air-conditioning that Eureka added to supplement what was supplied
by the building and to substitute for it when the building shuts
its services down after office hours. Communications networks
operate around the clock, so services provided on a ``6 a.m. to 6
p.m.'' basis are not adequate.
</P>
<P>
   Vanech said he was planning to add other Think Tank conference
centers and has equipped the William Street space with a kitchen so
that events there can be catered. He uses words like ``hip'' and
``cool'' to describe what he is trying establish.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was also planning to get into the technology
incubator business as well. Incubator operators offer fully
equipped space to small technology companies, often in return for a
share of the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to call them `Thinkubators,' '' Vanech said. He
said he expected to announce an incubator venture with a New York
real estate company in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   McNeil, the Columbia dean, said he thought the William Street
project was a good illustration of how ``the nonprofit sector can
work with the profit sector to satisfy mutual needs.'' And he said
the project built a bond between an educational institution and a
company that expected to hire students when they completed their
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back at the project's development, he said the
relationship allowed him to do business in a way that might have
surprised his colleagues at Columbia's law school. ``We did it all
on a handshake,'' he said.

NETS MOVE UP IN PLAYOFF RACE
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ When the buzzer sounded as the New
Jersey Nets and Milwaukee Bucks scrambled around for the loose ball
that was slipping off hands and through legs, Stephon Marbury
excitedly pumped his fist, making perhaps the first move of the
long and arduous game that did not seem tinged with rust.
</P>
<P>
   Following an unusual stretch of five days off that seemed to
cause the Nets to forget everything that they had learned this
season, they took the floor at the Continental Airlines Arena and
spent most of the game throwing balls into the stands and launching
shots that never came near their target.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While the aesthetics of the game may not have earned the Nets
any believers, the result just might as they overcame an ugly
performance to survive with a 92-90 overtime win over the Bucks,
taking another awkward step in their improbable march to a playoff
berth. Who could argue that something strange is happening when the
Nets persevered for their first overtime win since Jan. 21, 1998. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The win, the Nets fourth straight, moved them within two games
of the Bucks and the Orlando Magic for the eighth and final playoff
slot in the Eastern Conference and secured the tiebreaker for the
Nets against both those teams. Saturday, the Nets shrugged off the
rust just as routinely as they have moved on from the loss of
Jayson Williams and the 2-15 start that seemed destined to line up
everyone from players to management on the unemployment line.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a great game for us to win today,'' said Marbury, who
had 19 points and 11 assists and nearly had a dubious triple-double
as he matched a season-high with eight turnovers. ``We were really
rusty at the beginning, but those are the games you have to win. It
was very frustrating, but we got the job done. The win was the most
important thing. We all were kind of rusty and we got off to a slow
start, but eventually we picked it up.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Eventually would not come until the extra session as the Nets
had to struggle to force overtime. And even after they took a 91-90
lead with 2:28 to play in overtime on a 3-point field goal by
Lucious Harris, they did their best to keep the Bucks alive. Tim
Thomas, who had tied the game late in regulation by driving past
Keith Van Horn, tried again, but misfired this time with 15 seconds
left.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Van Horn grabbed the rebound and was fouled with 10.2 seconds
left. He made the first free throw, but missed the second that
would have given the Nets a 3-point lead. But they got a reprieve
when Jamie Feick tapped the errant shot out near midcourt where
Kendall Gill ran the loose ball down. Gill was fouled with 7.2
seconds to play, and the 72.4 percent shooter missed both free
throws for what he claimed was the first time in his career, giving
the Bucks the ball and one more chance with 5.2 seconds remaining. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But, playing as little like a contender as the Nets, Glenn
Robinson slipped as he caught the inbounds pass. He pushed the ball
out to Sam Cassell, but the former Nets' desperation three-point
attempt caught the front side of the rim and went to the floor
where the clock expired as neither team, fittingly, could pick the
ball up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were extremely rusty,'' Gill said. ``We weren't doing half
the things we normally do. But it was defense in the end and the
belief in ourselves that we could win towards the end. They played
a great game. We just gutted it out. I wouldn't even say we had
more will than them. The ball just bounced our way.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Van Horn, who led the Nets with 27 points on 10-of-16 shooting,
added: ``That was unbelievably big, in terms of standings, in terms
of confidence coming off the five days off, and also in terms of
the tiebreakers because this was another tiebreaker game for us, a
crucial tiebreaker and it a great win. ``We didn't play great
tonight. It was definitely an ugly win. But we played solid defense
and that's what carried us because our offense definitely wasn't
there.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In regulation, the play may have been worse. The Nets trailed by
four points with less than a minute to play, but Marbury closed the
gap to one when he drove the lane and flipped in a reverse layup,
turning it into a three-point play with 55.7 seconds to play. One
free throw by Feick tied the score and then the Nets moved in front
when Ray Allen missed badly on a drive and fouled Harris on the
battle for the rebound. Harris hit a pair of free throws with 16.5
seconds left to give the Nets a two-point lead.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the Nets then gave up a far too easy layup to Thomas as the
New Jersey native drove from the top of the circle, blowing past
Keith Van Horn and over Feick with 12.7 seconds to play in
regulation. Marbury then isolated Sam Cassell up top for one final
shot, but as he got in the lane, his shot bounced off the back of
the rim as time expired. ``What do you want us to do, give it
back?'' Nets coach Don Casey said. ``It wasn't very effective at
times. The layoff did affect us to some extent. You could sense it,
but they hung in there.'' &QL;

<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan _ Chen Shui-bian, an opposition politician who
long advocated Taiwan's independence, was elected its new president
Saturday, ending half a century of Nationalist rule and risking
dangerous new tensions with mainland China.
</P>
<P>
   Chen, a 49-year-old lawyer who served as mayor of Taipei and
struggled and against martial law in the 1980s, won with 39 percent
of the vote in a bitter three-way race. The Nationalist candidate
slumped to third place.
</P>
<P>
   Chen's victory, the first transition of power in Taiwan's young
democracy, was made possible by a schism in the Nationalist Party
that led one of its leaders, James Soong, to mount an independent
candidacy. Soong, a populist former governor of Taipei province,
came in second with a strong 37 percent showing; Vice President
Lien Chan, the Nationalist candidate, got just 23 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Chen and his Democratic Progressive Party called for
independence from the mainland, which considers Taiwan a wayward
region that must return to the motherland. The president-elect, who
will take office May 20, succeeding Taiwan's first elected
president, Lee Heng-tui, has recently moderated that position,
saying no declaration of independence is needed because Taiwan is
already sovereign.
</P>
<P>
   But Beijing has called Chen deceitful and issued dire warnings
against his election, with Prime Minister Zhu Rongji all but saying
last week that it could provoke a war.
</P>
<P>
   To reassure nervous citizens and governments abroad _ including
Washington, which has pledged to help Taiwan defend itself if
attacked _ Chen tried to reach out to the Chinese in his victory
speech Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   He avoided inflammatory references to Taiwanese ``statehood,''
and said he would seek deeper economic ties and ``a permanent
peace.'' He has promised he will not declare independence or hold a
referendum on the issue unless Taiwan comes under attack.
</P>
<P>
   However, in a statement certain to anger Beijing, he also
pledged, ``We won't let Taiwan become another Hong Kong or Macau.''
Those former colonies have been handed back to China, which has
granted them broad autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In a brief statement read on Chinese television, Beijing said it
would adopt a wait-and-see attitude toward Taiwan's new leader, and
reiterated its view that Taiwan is part of Chinese territory.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, President Clinton said he saw the election as a
demonstration of the vitality of democracy and an opportunity for
Taiwan and China to open a new dialogue.``The United States
strongly supports such dialogue and is committed to promoting
peace, stability and prosperity in the region,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Some 83 percent of Taiwan's voters turned out after a campaign
dominated by worries over relations with China and public
impatience with the corrupt political practices of the
Nationalists.
</P>
<P>
   Chen faces a legislature still dominated by the Nationalists,
who have ruled firmly since Chiang Kai-shek retreated here from the
Communist-dominated mainland in 1949. Taiwan is in for a period of
unprecedented political reshuffling and uncertainty, even as it
faces a possible confrontation with China.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Speaking to thousands of cheering supporters, Chen declared
Saturday night that his success ``is not a victory for the
Democratic Progressive Party _ it is a victory for democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   In a subtle friendly gesture to China and to some of his
fiercest enemies at home _ those who fled the mainland after the
Communist victory in 1949 _ Chen gave his acceptance speech in
Mandarin Chinese rather than in the Taiwanese dialect he often used
in campaign rallies.
</P>
<P>
   But Chen refuses to accept China's hallowed notion of ``One
China,'' and in answer to a question Saturday night he said China's
``one country, two systems'' formula for enlisting Taiwan as an
autonomous region ``would never be accepted by the Taiwanese
people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are determined to defend this island but we are also
determined to seek peace and stability,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to reassure foreign governments that he will not
take reckless actions, Chen has promised to retain the current
defense minister, top national security officials and the military
chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   Chen, like 85 percent of the island's population and many
supporters of his political party, is considered an ethnic
Taiwanese, descended from people who immigrated from the mainland
centuries ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Taiwanese resentment of the brutal takeover of their island
by Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists in the late 1940s eventually
spawned a dissident movement for democracy and independence. In the
1970s and '80s, early leaders of what would later become the
Democratic Progressive Party were imprisoned.
</P>
<P>
   Chen became involved as a defense lawyer for the dissidents and
then entered politics after martial law was lifted in 1987 and the
Democratic Progressives became the main opposition party. For many
of the party's supporters, Saturday night's victory is an emotional
culmination of decades of struggle.
</P>
<P>
   The Nationalists, for their part, have been thrown into turmoil
and their powerful chairman, President Lee Teng-hui, is now on the
spot. Lee's feud with Soong helped cause the devastating defeat,
and the party could suffer a permanent split if the popular Soong
tries to form his own party now.
</P>
<P>
   Soong apologized to his supporters for losing, but did not say
whether he would seek to form a new party or try to take over the
Nationalist Party.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Already Saturday night, Huang Quen-huei, the secretary general
of the Nationalists, offered his resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Late Saturday night, a large crowd of Soong's supporters, most
of then longtime Nationalists who felt Lee had betrayed the party
by snubbing Soong, marched to Lee's official residence and his
party's headquarters in central Taipei to shout for Lee to step
down as party boss. Both buildings were surrounded by riot police
and there were some scuffles.
</P>
<P>
   Chen has called for public disclosure of the Nationalists'
multibillion-dollar investments and confiscation of any properties
that should belong to the state rather than the party.
</P>
<P>
   But Chen also said Saturday night that he bore no animosity
toward his campaign opponents and that he hoped to work with the
Nationalists to build a ``cross-party alliance,'' though he did not
offer specifics.
</P>
<P>
   His ability to forge a coalition will be crucial to his success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chen Shui-bian's immediate challenge is that he has to act as
a president, not just a leader of an opposition movement,'' said
Chu Yun-han, a political scientist at National Taiwan University.
``Nearly two-thirds of the electorate didn't vote for him, and many
are deeply suspicious of his approach to the mainland.''
</P>
<P>
   The defeated Nationalist candidate, Lien, had used scare tactics
in the final weeks of the campaign, suggesting that Chen could
bring disaster to the island.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night he was more gracious in conceding, calling the
transition a milestone for Taiwan's democracy. ``I hope the new
president will handle state matters properly, leading our country
into a new era,'' he said before a crestfallen line of party
leaders. ``We can still regroup. From today we need to engage in
self-examination and reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee remained silent and secluded in his residence, where he
summoned the military chief of staff and the defense minister.
There have been reports here of Chinese troop movements on the
mainland, although no one expects imminent military action.
</P>
<P>
   Chen's victory reflected, in part, a demographic trend that
bodes ill for the Nationalists and also for China's hope of
peaceful reunification: many younger people have no allegiance to
the Nationalist Party their parents long served, and think of China
as a distant concept.
</P>
<P>
   Since the first presidential election in 1996, more than 1
million young people became eligible to vote, Chu noted. And fully
half of them said in recent surveys that they were voting for Chen,
who is seen as representing youthful energy and cleaned-up
politics.
</P>
<P>
   China's military threats do not intimidate such people. A
typical example is Yang Jie-lung, a 27-year-old graphic designer.
Approached Saturday morning as he left the polling booth, he would
not discuss his preferences until his mother, a lifelong
Nationalist, was out of earshot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope Chen Shui-bian can win,'' he said. ``He's the best one
to clean up the problems left by the Nationalists, and as mayor he
did a pretty good job.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the mainland's dark warnings, he said: ``We are not
obliged to take any advice from China. We are electing our own
president.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in Lee's hometown of Sanchi, northwest of Taipei, voters
rebuffed the president's plea to keep the Nationalists in power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should I listen to Lee Teng-hui?'' asked Pan Yue-ching,
38, a homemaker. ``I have my own opinions.'' The voters also
appeared unimpressed with the threats from China. ``It's always the
same between these two countries,'' said Lee Fung-lin, also 38 and
an unemployed restaurant worker. ``They just shout at each other.''

the church sees Jews - as ``elder brothers'' rather than traitors -

makes this visit will be on diplomatic eggshells, tuning out the

   WEATHER CHANGE ADVISORY:
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times News Service is planning an expanded weather
package starting today. The package, consisting of a weather map as
a graphics file and a text file to accompany the map, is available
to graphics clients of the News Service.
</P>
<P>
   The new map grows to 4 columns in width (52 picas), from 3, and
is 6 inches deep; the old was 4 inches deep. This new size permits
the insertion of cloud cover information, previously a separate
map, and the addition of many new cities.
</P>
<P>
   The map is available both in color and in black and white.
Because the map is much more detailed, we have devised an entirely
new palette of colors to make it easier to read the added
information.
</P>
<P>
   A sample of the new map is available at Wieck, Newscom,
Presslink and AP's GraphicsNet.
</P>
<P>
   Some papers using the old map may need extra time to make the
transition to a 4-column format. We will, for a limited time,
produce a 3-col version of the new map, but with only some of the
new map's additional cities.

TAIWAN'S VOTERS YEARN FOR FRESH STYLES AND IDEAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Grafs 10 and 11 are new.)  
 (bl)  
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANCHI, Taiwan _ Lee Teng-hui has loomed large over Taiwan, and
nowhere more than in this hilly seaside village northwest of
Taipei: Lee, the island's first democratically elected president,
was born here in a sturdy red brick farmhouse that still draws
visitors every day.
</P>
<P>
   But Saturday, as Taiwan's voters went to the polls to elect a
successor to Lee, the president's birthplace was deserted. And in
town, where people lined up to cast their ballots, Lee's legendary
influence over Taiwanese politics was disappearing at the voting
booth as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though I admire Lee, it's important for me to vote for
someone who will change Taiwan's society,'' said Chiang Wen-ding,
53, a retired factory worker who voted for Chen Shui-bian, the
Democratic Progressive candidate, over the president's anointed
successor, Vice President Lien Chan.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Jian-long, a 22-year-old business management student who
voted for James Soong, the independent candidate, said: ``As a
young person, I'm not influenced at all by whom Lee Teng-hui says
to vote for. I voted for James Soong because he would be a new kind
of leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Chang Ai-huei, 31, an office worker, said she too voted for
Soong, because she yearns for fresh leadership after five decades
of rule by the Nationalist Party. ``Voting for Lien Chan is like
voting for Lee Teng-hui, and I think it is time for a change,''
said Chang, as she gestured impatiently toward the Nationalist
Party's campaign headquarters across the street.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with more than a dozen voters in Sanchi on Saturday
indicated strong support for both the eventual winner, Chen, and
the runner-up, Soong, who is a bitter rival of Lee. Remarkably,
even in the president's hometown, voters _ young and old, male and
female _ rebuffed Lee's repeated pleas to elect Lien and extend the
Nationalist Party's half-century reign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should I listen to Lee Teng-hui?'' asked Pan Yue-ching, a
38-year-old housewife. ``I have my own opinions.''
</P>
<P>
   Some longtime loyalists consoled themselves that although they
were rejecting Lee's party, they were not necessarily flouting his
deeper wishes. They seized on widespread rumors that Lee has frosty
relations with Lien and prefers Chen on a personal level.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lee is secretly supporting Chen, but as KMT chairman, he must
support Lien,'' said Chiang, the factory worker, using the initials
for Kuomintang, the Nationalist Party's Chinese name. Another Chen
supporter interjected, ``President Lee keeps shouting Lien Chan,
but when he holds up his hand, it says 5,'' a reference to Chen's
number on the presidential ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone ignored Lee's importunings. Chiang Wen-shoun, 64,
was driven to town by his son to vote for Lien. ``I don't really
like Lien Chan,'' said Chiang, a farmer. ``But I voted for him
because Lee Teng-hui told us to. I know that if Lien wins, Lee
Teng-hui will still be in charge.''
</P>
<P>
   In Sanchi, as elsewhere in Taiwan, the Nationalists drew on a
reservoir of support in rural areas and among older people, many
born in mainland China, who fear that Chen would inflame tensions
across the Taiwan Strait. But that did not offset the younger
voters who were determined to overturn the status-quo.
</P>
<P>
   People who voted for Chen said they believed that he would shake
up Taiwan's political culture, which has been ossified by more than
50 years of single-party rule. They accused the Nationalist Party
of corrupting the electoral process by buying votes and through
other forms of bribery.
</P>
<P>
   Although some voters said that electing Chen could increase
tension between Taiwan and mainland China, they said it was not
enough to disqualify him. ``It's always the same between these two
countries,'' said Lee Fung-lin, 38, an unemployed restaurant
worker. ``They just shout at each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Chiang said he was not about to let Beijing dictate his choice.
``I've been living with the threat of mainland China for 50 years,
so I'm used to it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, on this day of defeat for Lee Teng-hui and his party, a
cousin, Lee Teng-wong, stopped on a bucolic road near the family
home to chat about the legacy of his famous relative. ``The
Taiwanese people will remember him for bringing them democracy,''
the cousin said.

PROPOSED `JAKE'S LAW' JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF EFFORT TO CHANGE LAWS
AFTER A TRAGEDY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TANYANIKA SAMUELS and RICHARD ESPINOZA  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ ``Megan.'' ``Amber.''
``Stephanie.'' ``Jessica.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   These common names have prompted uncommon political activism
because of the tragic stories that accompany them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jake'' may be next.
</P>
<P>
   Gina Gerdes said she cried for a week after reading about Jake
Robel, the 6-year-old Independence boy dragged to his death last
month in a car theft.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rayville woman's grief turned to anger when she learned
that Kim L. Davis, the man accused of killing Jake, had been
released from jail by mistake hours before the crime. Authorities
failed to check and discover that Davis had an outstanding warrant.
</P>
<P>
   Days later Gerdes met Kim Thomason of Lee's Summit on the
Internet. And like many people before them, they decided to take
action.
</P>
<P>
   The two wrote ``Jake's Law'' and have been pushing to make it
federal law. The proposal would require police to check for
warrants before releasing inmates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't sit around as a concerned citizen and as a mother
and watch this happen to anyone again,'' Thomason said. ``It was
time to do something.''
</P>
<P>
   High-profile tragedies often compel people to seek change in a
system they believe failed them. This compulsion can propel the
crusaders for years until that change happens.
</P>
<P>
   Only then is the appetite for change satiated. Only then do
those involved feel that something good has come from otherwise
horrifying news.
</P>
<P>
   Take ``Megan's Law.''
</P>
<P>
   Megan Kanka, 7, was raped and murdered in 1994 by a neighbor,
Jesse Timmendequas. Her parents, who lived in a small New Jersey
town, had no idea that Timmendequas was a twice-convicted
pedophile.
</P>
<P>
   They channeled their grief into a campaign for laws to notify
residents when a sex offender moved into their neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1996, President Clinton made that proposal law. At the
signing ceremony in the Oval Office, Megan's mother said her
daughter's death now had some meaning.
</P>
<P>
   Gerdes and Thomason are hoping to do the same for Jake. Though
police routinely check inmates' backgrounds for outstanding
warrants, there is no actual law. ``Jake's Law'' would make the
practice a federal requirement.
</P>
<P>
   Christy Robel, Jake's mother, said her family fully supported
the effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just incredible what they're doing,'' she said. ``Policy
and procedure is not good enough. Nobody is held liable when it's
just policy and procedure, but somebody will if it is a law.''
</P>
<P>
   Pushing for new legislation helps restore the feeling of control
that seems lost in the wake of a public tragedy, said Thomas
Underwood, director of the Center on Violence and Victim Studies,
at Washburn University in Topeka.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't control the fact that this tragedy happened,''
Underwood said. ``But what we can control and influence is
policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the journey from pain to policy is neither swift nor smooth.
</P>
<P>
   Peggy and Gene Schmidt of Leawood, Kan., know this all too well.
Their 19-year-old daughter, Stephanie Schmidt, was murdered by an
ex-convict and repeat sex offender.
</P>
<P>
   The Schmidts have spent the last seven years lobbying state
officials to create laws to deal with sexual predators. They have
sacrificed their careers to the effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``To do something right, you've got to give all your time,''
Peggy Schmidt said. ``It's more time-consuming, but it's more
rewarding.''
</P>
<P>
   Their work began slowly, with an appearance on a radio show a
day after their daughter's funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators and other supporters helped set up a task force to
discuss ways to protect society from convicted sexual predators.
</P>
<P>
   The Schmidts trekked from their Leawood home for about four
months of meetings at the Kansas Capitol. They spent so much time
in Topeka, they decided to rent an apartment there. They gave up
their advertising business, liquidated their assets and lived off
their savings.
</P>
<P>
   They did not plan to give up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't do anything more to help Stephanie,'' Gene Schmidt
said. ``But we could help her sister and her friends, and that
became our motivation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas sexual-predator law, which permits some inmates to be
locked up for treatment after completing their sentences, was
signed nine months after Stephanie Schmidt's death. The Schmidts
also worked to pass a similar law in Missouri and now talk to
people about passing sexual-predator laws in other states.
</P>
<P>
   The Schmidts said they had found that passing laws at the state
level was easier than working on federal legislation.
</P>
<P>
   One factor is the competition among hundreds of bills.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri Rep. Vicky Hartzler, a Harrisonville Republican, said
Gerdes and Thomason would have to work to make ``Jake's Law'' a
priority. It helps to assign a public tragedy to a proposed law,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When there is a large public outcry against a wrong, it gives
impetus to legislators to change the law in an expeditious
fashion,'' Hartzler said. ``Since this is such a visual case, it
will work in their favor.''
</P>
<P>
   It helps also to have a namesake.
</P>
<P>
   ``It puts a name and a face to the legislation and clearly
demonstrates the direct need for it and the impact it could have on
people,'' Hartzler said.
</P>
<P>
   Hartzler recalled voting for ``Jessica's Law'' in June 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Jessica Leicht, a St. Louis-area third grader, was struck and
killed when she darted in front of a school bus. The driver did not
see her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jessica's Law'' requires school buses to have ``safety arms''
that swing out in front of buses when they stop to pick up or
unload children. That forces students to arc around the bus and
stay within the driver's sight.
</P>
<P>
   Amber Hagerman, 9, was abducted from her Texas home and killed
in 1996. After her death, Arlington police created the ``Amber
Plan'' to notify the public of a child kidnapping immediately
through the media.
</P>
<P>
   The plan has been adopted in several other states including
Kansas and Missouri, where it is called the ``Amber Alert.''
</P>
<P>
   Hartzler is hoping that a bill named after a Cass County teen
soon will become law. She plans to re-introduce ``Stacy's Bill,''
named for 15-year-old Stacy Cox, who died in a 1995 car crash.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would increase penalty points against careless drivers
who cause an accident or death. The bill also would require
mandatory chemical testing of a driver who causes a fatal accident.
</P>
<P>
   Though having a name helps, many efforts have been successful
without it.
</P>
<P>
   For John Walsh, host of ``America's Most Wanted,'' persistence
paid.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh lobbied the federal government to address the plight of
child victims after his 6-year-old son, Adam, was kidnapped and
killed in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Congress passed two laws in the early '80s, one of which created
the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.
</P>
<P>
   Linda and Galen Bird of Grandview did not assign their
daughter's name to their cause, either.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Bird, 20, was killed in 1992 when a car she was riding in
crashed into the end of a guardrail, which speared the car.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after her death, the family learned that the type of
guardrail that killed their daughter was known for decades to be
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of an official from the Federal Highway
Administration, the Birds started working to make guardrails safer.
States, which would have to pay to upgrade to safer guardrails,
fought the change.
</P>
<P>
   But on Sept. 30, 1994, the Highway Administration told states to
change their guardrails. In 1996, Kansas began a five-year program
to modernize highway guardrails.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just knowing that we're saving lives helps,'' Linda Bird said.
</P>
<P>
   In cases where human error is the problem, however, passing more
laws will not help, said R. Chris Martin, professor of psychology
at the University of Missouri-Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``Punishment is not the way to correct a social problem,''
Martin said. ``We should use incentives as opposed to the threat of
a stick. Use the carrot instead of the stick.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Gerdes and Thomason said they would not rest until
``Jake's Law'' became federal law.
</P>
<P>
   They have been working with U.S. Rep. Karen McCarthy, a Missouri
Democrat. A spokesman for McCarthy said last week that government
officials were still studying what steps, if any, should be taken
on the federal level.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Gerdes and Thomason's efforts got a boost when five
Missouri state representatives filed a bill to require all
correctional facilities in Missouri to do warrant checks before
releasing prisoners. Anyone failing to do so would be charged with
a Class A misdemeanor and be suspended, under the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realize it could pass on the Missouri level really soon,
but we're not going to stop there,'' Thomason said. ``And if anyone
thinks we're going to shut up and go away, we're not.''

AREA TEEN HAS CHANCE AT $40,000 PRIZE -- PLAYING COMPUTER GAMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAMES A. FUSSELL  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Johnathan Wendel is
on the verge of realizing many teen-agers' wildest dream _ making a
living playing computer games.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kid stuff?
</P>
<P>
   Hardly. He's one of the favorites to win a $40,000 first prize
in an upcoming computer tournament in Dallas. What's more,
game.MDBO/.MDNM/ experts say they would not be surprised to see the
Lee's Summit teen make more than $100,000 this year as tournaments
grow bigger and richer.
</P>
<P>
   Wendel, 19, is one of the best computer game players in the
world. And when he plays his game of choice _ a first-person action
game called Quake 3 Arena _ he is unbeatable. Well, virtually.
</P>
<P>
   In the last half-year, Wendel has won Quake tournaments in
Missouri, Texas, Kentucky and California. In January he won the
world championship in Sweden by going 18-0. In the five months he
has been playing in tournaments, he has lost a grand total of three
games. He is so good, a computer-mouse maker wants to sponsor him _
and put his picture on its products.
</P>
<P>
   Any wonder he practices sometimes 12 to 15 hours a day?
</P>
<P>
   Competitive computer gaming has grown rapidly, thanks to the
Internet and the proliferation of home computers. Millions of
people worldwide play, and advertisers are taking notice. More and
more companies are sponsoring tournaments that offer prize money.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is that hundreds of thousands of gamers follow the
competitions over the Internet, ensuring advertisers access to a
young, technology-savvy audience with loads of disposable income.
</P>
<P>
   Wendel thinks he can be one of the stars of a professional
circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have seen him play believe it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen Johnathan in person play on four different
occasions,'' said Robert Krakhoff, the general manager of Razer, a
San Francisco company that makes precision products for serious
gamers. ``And my personal opinion is he is the top player today.''
</P>
<P>
   He will get a chance to test his abilities again April 13-16 in
Dallas when the Cyberathlete Professional League holds a $100,000
Quake 3 tournament. The tournament, which offers a record first
prize of $40,000, will feature top players from New Zealand,
Russia, South Africa, Sweden, Germany, the United Kingdom and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Wendel is one of the early favorites.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just try to be very talented at everything I do,'' he said.
``I'm just trying to be the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Being the best at Quake 3 is not easy. It is one of the most
popular computer games in the world. Players control futuristic
gladiators and use strategy and cunning (not to mention an arsenal
of machine guns, rocket launchers, plasma guns and other weapons)
in a game of survival.
</P>
<P>
   The game features plenty of grunts, explosions, footsteps and
countless other sounds of battle. In the game _ often played
against one or more human opponents on the Internet _ a player
moves inside any of several enclosed arenas that feature dark
corners, hallways, stairs, different levels, weapons, ammunition
and protective armor.
</P>
<P>
   Quake 3 portrays virtual violence, but Wendel said that was not
what interested him. He plays Quake for the strategy and takes
advantage of the computer option that allows him to turn off blood
and gore.
</P>
<P>
   Wendel plays in the finished basement of his father's home. He
hunches over the glowing machine, which sits on a long table under
a photo gallery of sports heroes. He plays as ``Sarge,'' a large
and menacing animated bruiser who quickly finds a weapon and begins
looking for a reason to use it.
</P>
<P>
   Using the mouse he moves forward, side to side, searching for
his opponent, gun at the ready. He runs up stairs, moves between
levels.
</P>
<P>
   He listens for an opportunity to kill an opponent who may be
right around the corner. He sets up his attack. His opponent comes
into view. Wendel is in perfect position.
</P>
<P>
   Some people may stereotype Wendel as some sort of slack-jawed
cybergoof.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing could be further from the truth. As a senior at Blue
Springs South High School last year, he was an honor student with a
3.71 grade-point average and captain of the tennis team. He has a
girlfriend and is an excellent swimmer, pool player, baseball and
football player. Sitting in the living room of his father's home,
Wendel seemed fit, unassuming and happy.
</P>
<P>
   Wendel is in college now at DeVry Institute of Technology.
Officially he's studying to get a job in the computer field. But
emotionally there's no secret where his real desire lies. He wants
to be a ``professional'' gamer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think for sure this is going to turn into something like the
PGA (Professional Golfers' Association), where they have
tournaments all the time,'' he said. ``Eventually you will have a
set amount of people who will be on the pro tour, and everybody
will make money.''
</P>
<P>
   For Wendel, his newfound Quake experience is as exciting as
Christmas morning. He remembers the thrill less than two months ago
when Swedish tournament organizers offered to pay for his trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was like, that would be awesome!'' he said, his voice
steeped in youthful enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   So Wendel, who had never been overseas before, flew to
Stockholm, Sweden, by himself. In only his second tournament he
calmly conquered an international field of top players without
losing a game.
</P>
<P>
   There is only one way to get that good.
</P>
<P>
   He tweaked his computer for maximum performance, discovered
places to hide, places to avoid, when to be aggressive and when to
run away. And more important, he discovered what nearly every sound
in the game meant. Recognizing sounds can give players an advantage
by helping them keep better track of their opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone can be this good. Educational experts worry that
the increasing money for top game players may cause more young
people to forgo their studies to concentrate on playing games.
</P>
<P>
   But just as few people can become Kobe Bryant and star in the
National Basketball Association out of high school, they said, few
people are good enough to make a living playing computer games.
Even though Wendel plays a lot, experts note that he did not
sacrifice his schoolwork or outside activities.
</P>
<P>
   He did, however, clash with his mother over playing time.
</P>
<P>
   Wendel's parents are divorced and remarried to other people.
Wendel used to live with his mother. According to him, she disliked
the nature of the game and limited his playing time. Recently,
Wendel's mother said she had no comment about her son and his
gaming.
</P>
<P>
   Last May tensions in his mother's house reached an impasse,
Wendel said. His mother and his stepfather grounded him from his
computer for three months for staying on the computer too long, and
using a telephone line he had been told not to use to connect to
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   So one day after high school, he took computer equipment he had
paid for _ his sound and video cards, his Pentium II 350 processor,
his modem and speakers _ loaded them in his Ford Explorer and drove
to his father's house.
</P>
<P>
   Wendel's father, James Wendel, knows the stereotypes of
heavy-duty gamers. But he notes his son is healthy, smart and in
college.
</P>
<P>
   .MDNM/``We don't know how he does it,'' he said. ``He's just a
very good boy, and we're behind him all the way.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, so good. Wendel has received free trips, free hotel
stays and offers of lucrative corporate sponsorship. He's also won
about $7,000 in cash prizes. The April tournament will be his first
test to see whether he can win the big money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty confident,'' he said. ``I feel ready to go. This
will be a big thing for me if I win. This will affect my whole
future.''

REBIRTH OF RESTAURANT REKINDLES MEMORIES OF LADY WHO MADE IT A
LANDMARK  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM FISHER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   GALLATIN, Mo. _ A north Missouri
landmark that brought a modicum of gentility to this land of corn,
hogs, callused hands and sunburned necks reopened Tuesday after
being closed for three years.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The McDonald Tea Room restaurant, a white structure southwest of
the Daviess County courthouse square, was crowded almost from its
opening at 11 a.m. And the crowds continued the rest of last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting calls from Utah, Illinois, all sorts of places,''
said Jean Kirkendoll, who with her husband, Bud, owns the Tea Room.
</P>
<P>
   Jean expects to attract not only the local lunch and contract
bridge crowds but also bus tours, weddings and family reunions,
plus the tourists who flock to nearby Jamesport with its Amish
customs, and the Mormons who come to the Adam-ondi-Ahman historic
site.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are coming,'' she said. ``The response from the minute
we started working last summer has just been unbelievable. They
were making reservations even back them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kirkendolls, who have owned the meat locker here for years,
bought the old structure from the local bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not for a whole lot,'' Jean said. ``But then you should have
seen the shape it was in.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple have poured thousands of dollars into renovations,
turning the building into a reproduction of a Victorian inn with
delicate wainscoting and 18 tinkling chandeliers, tablecloths and
quilted napkins, and polished staircases and gleaming mirrors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Virginia would be pleased,'' Jean said.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia, of course, was Virginia Prather McDonald, dead since
1969, yet still an ethereal presence in Gallatin. Those middle-age
and older still talk of her.
</P>
<P>
   In 1907 Virginia married Charles McDonald, a drummer (what
traveling salesman were called then), in Austin, Texas. They came
north to his native Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Here, Virginia fell ill with tuberculosis, spending several
years in semiseclusion in a small house just north of the structure
that is now the restaurant, but which in those years was the home
of Charles' parents.
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1920s, Virginia regained her health, her husband's
parents were dead, and the childless couple moved into the big
house. They converted part of it into an emporium, where they sold
groceries and snacks.
</P>
<P>
   They were also in debt to the tune of $8,000 _ then an absolute
fortune _ because of Virginia's illness.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Depression clamped down, Virginia had an idea.
</P>
<P>
   She would bring fine food to this place, where the standard fare
often consisted of a heap of meat and potatoes, creamed corn, white
bread for sopping up the brown gravy, big glasses of ice water and
a huge slice of pie. Farm fare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Virginia liked what she served to look nice,'' Jean said.
``Little pads of butter shaped like roses. Garnishments on the
salads like carrot curls. Her corn bread was round, not square.
She's put cheese and peas in baked potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of variety. And the portions were smaller. Not
like you'd get at a cafe. And the food, they said, was delicious.''
</P>
<P>
   Virginia opened the Tea Room in 1931. Suddenly, in little
Gallatin, there was a place to eat with real napkins, beautiful
dishes and glassware. Women diners wore hats and white gloves, and
men dressed in coats and occasionally even wore ties.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the Tea Room, the crushing economic malaise could be
pushed away. At least for the time it took to eat.
</P>
<P>
   ``What she did,'' said Joe Snyder, 82, the former newspaper
editor here and a friend of Virginia, ``was send Charlie down to
the train depot. Back then we had the Wabash and the Rock Island.
Charlie could spot the drummer 'cause he had been one, and he'd
tell them about this place where they could get a real meal, not
the greasy-spoon kind they were used to.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that started it. Drummers spread the word. And before you
know it she had people piling in.''
</P>
<P>
   Other people, that new breed called motorists, talked up the
meals they had here. That brought people from St. Joseph; Des
Moines, Iowa; Omaha, Neb.; Kansas City; and points in between. For
a couple of generations in this part of the country, a trip to the
McDonald Tea Room was a high point.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did it hurt that in 1937, culinary guru Duncan Hines, author
of Adventures in Good Eating, selected the Tea Room as one of the
best restaurants in America. It was on the list for 27 straight
years.
</P>
<P>
   There were write-ups in Better Homes and Gardens magazine and in
innumerable Sunday supplements. Another bonus was that Virginia's
cookbook, How I Cook It, was chosen by the Book-of-the-Month Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``Virginia loved the publicity,'' Snyder said. ``She'd go off
and speak in New York or Chicago or down south. She was something
else.''
</P>
<P>
   R.L. Woody, who as a boy worked at a big grocery store here,
remembers a woman in flowing dresses, high-heeled shoes and
large-brimmed hats _ said to come from milliners in New York and
Paris _ floating across the square.
</P>
<P>
   ``She'd tap on the store's window, and we'd go out and get the
list of what she needed for the Tea Room,'' Woody said. ``She
wouldn't come in. That wasn't for her. We'd fill the order and take
it around.''
</P>
<P>
   Snyder said Virginia's style rankled some.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some thought she was too fancy for us,'' Snyder said. ``You
know how people think _ do well, but don't do so well that you make
us look bad.''
</P>
<P>
   There was one story that J.C. Penney, the department store
mogul, had come to Gallatin from down the road at Hamilton, Mo.,
his birthplace, and that Virginia refused service because he didn't
meet her dress code.
</P>
<P>
   ``Completely false,'' Snyder said. ``Farmers ate there all the
time. But that was the kind of story people told on her. Maybe she
was a little eccentric in her later years. To me, she was a sweet,
old lady who occasionally lived in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Charlie died in 1951. Virginia held on 18 more years. After her
death, the Tea Room went through a succession of owners. But, said
Doris Lynn, a former cook, ``You could just see the business drop
off a little every year.''
</P>
<P>
   Jean, 55, said she and Bud, 57, thought long about getting into
the restaurant business. Once they made up their minds, she said,
they aimed to do it right. Jean has hired five cooks and 20 servers
and, being a good cook herself, will oversee what comes out of the
new kitchen, the only part of the structure they totally demolished
and rebuilt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have glazed ham, baked spaghetti, pork chops, steaks,
chicken, and all the nice salads and wonderful desserts Virginia
had,'' she said. ``The one thing we won't do is use raw eggs like
Virginia did. Look at her recipes and she loved to put raw eggs in
food. The state won't let you do that anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The recipes?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yes,' Jean said. ``I've got them. I've got them all.''

MAIN STREETS OF AMERICA PROVIDE REAL LINKS TO INTERNET COMMERCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ERIC PALMER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Arthur Valdez looks
slightly embarrassed as he picks a compact disc and a children's
book off the concrete floor of the Amazon.com warehouse he oversees
in Coffeyville, Kan.
<TEXT>
<P>
   They fell off 12 miles of conveyer superhighway whizzing at
different heights throughout the 750,000-square-foot metal cavern.
</P>
<P>
   Valdez strides purposefully up a flight of yellow metal stairs
to an intersection of conveyers. He runs the items' Universal
Product Codes under a scanner and then drops them on a conveyer.
They stop abruptly beneath a red laser beam while the computer
seems to do an ``Ah, there you are.''
</P>
<P>
   Then they are whisked away to different destinations, where they
will be packaged, labeled, sorted by delivery service and shipped _
all within 24 hours of the Internet click that started the process.
</P>
<P>
   To Valdez, tens of thousands of products shipped from the
11-month-old Coffeyville warehouse are on their way to a fictitious
Betty in North Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to become intimate with that brown box because
unfortunately we do not have the ability to go meet our customer at
the time of delivery,'' Valdez said. ``So our customer is Betty,
who is in that brown box right now, and we need to treat her as if
this is the most important event since sliced bread.''
</P>
<P>
   Valdez has captured the essential issue facing the e-commerce
world.
</P>
<P>
   The flamboyance of e-commerce may be in Silicon Valley, but
industry experts believe the war will be won on the main streets of
towns like Coffeyville. And even dominant e-tailer Amazon, which
last year lost 44 cents for every $1 of net sales it brought in,
has yet to strike upon a profitable strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon spent $200 million developing five distribution centers
in the United States last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Infrastructure is all this mass lurking underneath the
iceberg, and it is very important. It's where your brand is either
made or broken,'' said Jim Daniell, chief executive of OrderTrust
Inc. The Boston area company operates a computer network to connect
Web merchants with suppliers and distributors. ``If people don't
get their merchandise and they are unhappy, they will tell 10
others, and those people will never come to your site.'' Keeping
customers
</P>
<P>
   When Amazon began selling books on the Internet in 1996, it
opened a modest, 93,000-square-foot warehouse at its Seattle
headquarters. Orders came in, and books were mailed out. A year
later it tripled its warehouse space by opening a second facility
on the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, when Amazon morphed its vision into becoming an
Internet supermarket, carrying everything from toys to band saws,
how to house and distribute millions of products became critical.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon decided it had to own its distribution to control its
destiny. Inherent in Internet shopping is the element of instant
gratification. To satisfy customers, Amazon promised it would ship
orders within 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate calling them distribution centers. These are plants
where we manufacture customer delight,'' said Jeff Wilke, vice
president in charge of distribution worldwide. ``If demand for
products surges beyond the plan, we don't have to negotiate for the
attention of our provider. Many of our competitors ran into
problems doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Research showed Internet companies that were unprepared for
demand spikes in the 1998 holiday season ended up with back orders
and upset customers.
</P>
<P>
   As evidence that its investment paid off, Wilke said more than
99 percent of Amazon customers got the products they ordered in
time for the 1999 holidays. Even an order made at 8:05 p.m. Dec. 23
was delivered to Honolulu by 3:55 p.m. Dec. 24.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon's warehouse expansion ``was to ensure one thing,'' Wilke
said, ``that we would ship more orders to our customers in time for
the holiday than anybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   The speed of the expansion created some problems, he
acknowledged. Some products were not where they needed to be. Some
orders had to be ``split,'' meaning multiple items ordered at the
same time were shipped separately, for the same cost as a single
order.
</P>
<P>
   The result? Higher costs.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Amazon reported $39 million in inventory costs in its
fourth quarter, or 16 percent of sales, up from 10 percent of sales
the year before.
</P>
<P>
   That was for a quarter in which it reported a net loss of $323
million, up from $46 million the year before. Amazon reported a
loss for the year of $720 million, up from $124.5 million the year
before.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Amazon is famous for being the Internet stock darling
that has yet to make a cent. Despite mounting losses, its stock
soared from $41 in August to $113 in December, adjusted for splits,
before declining in recent weeks to the $65 range. It closed Friday
at 64 13/16.
</P>
<P>
   Daniell said Internet merchants had learned that there were two
factors for success: selling vast numbers and flawless execution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amazon has been preaching that all along,'' Daniell said.
</P>
<P>
   Companies like Amazon have elaborate computer systems that take
orders, verify credit cards, alert warehouses, and locate, move and
track product. But Daniell said some companies were still
``sneakernetting.'' That involves taking orders through an Internet
computer system and then walking them to another computer system to
be entered for processing.
</P>
<P>
   Daniell, however, said that even low-level systems, taking
orders by e-mail or fax, could work if the right system was in
place.
</P>
<P>
   The most important thing is knowing there is a problem before
the customer does.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 2.5 percent of Internet orders just disappear,'' Daniell
said. ``If you know first that something is wrong or unavailable,
then you can contact the customer, maybe offer them an upgrade at
no charge, do something to keep them happy so you don't lose
them.'' Wants and needs
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts predict that companies like Amazon will eventually
have store locations. For now it has one of the most sophisticated
distribution systems in e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   When last year it decided to bulk up its delivery system for the
1999 holidays, there wasn't time to find perfect locations and
build new facilities, Wilke said. A computer model identified zones
close to populations and distribution centers. Amazon uses the U.S.
Postal Service for 60 percent of its deliveries and United Parcel
Service for most of the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Teams then looked for existing buildings that were near the
sizes needed, in communities that had the work ethic they wanted
and that wanted them.
</P>
<P>
   That meant economic incentives.
</P>
<P>
   Coffeyville made $1 million in infrastructure improvements and
offered up to $3.5 million in cash grants based upon Amazon
employing 1,000 people a year for 10 years. The money will come
from its municipal electric company, but between this project and
the $350 million expansion of a Farmland refinery, the city has
been able to reduce rates to all of its customers.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the technology and the 500 jobs so far, Coffeyville
leaders say Amazon has added a cache to the community of 13,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been amazing,'' said Leroy Alsup, Coffeyville city
manager. ``I don't know how you could pay for the positive exposure
to our community for something as exciting as Amazon.com.''
</P>
<P>
   Coffeyville had a former Golden Books warehouse for sale that
was about 450,000 square feet. Amazon added 300,000 square feet and
fitted it out with its material-handling system.
</P>
<P>
   Over the hum of machinery and beeping of forklifts, Valdez
explained the process.
</P>
<P>
   The company's central computer system directs orders to the
distribution center best equipped to handle them. Associates known
as ``pickers,'' who like all Amazon employees get stock options,
will select the items they are directed to by the computer. It
tells them which and how many items to select. Those are put in
green plastic totes and then placed on conveyers.
</P>
<P>
   Individual orders are combined in totes and go directly to an
automated shipping area. Multiple orders are combined, put on the
conveyor and dumped onto another conveyer that will sort them and
deliver them to one of thousands of chutes, where they are combined
by customer order before going to shipping.
</P>
<P>
   Items are scanned at least 17 times from the time they enter the
warehouse until they leave to make sure the consumers get what they
order, Valdez said.
</P>
<P>
   While this is still warehouse work, Amazon leaders stress to
workers that it is vital to the anticipated financial success of
the company. Managers such as Valdez have been recruited from
retailers like Wal-Mart and J.C. Penney. Warehouse pickers commute
from as far away as Tulsa, Okla., to be where virtual rubber hits
the real road.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every associate on this floor is such an important part of the
process because they are the last point of contact with the
customer,'' said Emily Glassman, a spokeswoman for Amazon. ``You
just can't minimize the role that Coffeyville and the associates
here play in Amazon.''

 Allen L. Sack, who played on Notre Dame's 1966 national
championship football team, is a professor of management at the
University of New Haven and co-author of ``College Athletes for
Hire: The Evolution and Legacy of the NCAA's Amateur Myth''
(1998).  
 By ALLEN L. SACK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although I grew up just outside Philadelphia, I have spent
little time in the downtown area since leaving for college in 1963.
Recently, though, my wife and I stopped to visit our son, who is a
graduate student at the University of Pennsylvania, and had an
opportunity to stroll around Center City.
</P>
<P>
   While walking down Locust Street, we came upon an elegant old
hotel, called the Warwick, that I was almost certain was the one I
had visited some 37 years earlier when I was a high school football
recruit. Given the many years that had passed, I decided to enter
the lobby just to make sure. I found a restaurant exactly where I
remembered one being and asked the headwaiter how long it had been
there. He guessed about 40 years. I then asked if he had ever heard
of Leonard Tose. When he responded that Tose has been a regular
customer for decades, I knew I had stumbled upon a significant
landmark from my past.
</P>
<P>
   When I first met Tose, I was one of the most sought after high
school quarterbacks in Pennsylvania. Tose, a trucking magnate who
would one day own the Eagles, had asked me to come to Philadelphia
to have dinner with him, and to discuss the possibility of my
accepting a football scholarship to the University of Notre Dame.
Tose was an enthusiastic Notre Dame ``subway alumnus.''
</P>
<P>
   I remember taking a train into the city. When I met Tose in the
lobby of the Warwick, he was impeccably dressed and wore what today
would be called a power tie. I had borrowed my brother's green
blazer for the occasion, and Mr. Tose, as I called him then,
remarked that it made me look as if I belonged at Notre Dame.
During dinner, we talked about my family, my educational goals and
the other colleges and universities that were recruiting me.
</P>
<P>
   When our discussion turned to finances, Mr. Tose said that if I
attended Notre Dame he would pay my travel expenses during the
school year, try to get me a summer job and help out with expenses
that my scholarship would not cover. I saw nothing particularly
unusual about these offers. After all, several universities had
already paid my travel expenses to visit their campuses, and
dinners, banquets, free game tickets and other special treatment
seemed like a normal part of the recruiting process. When I was
only in 10th grade, a recruiter offered to pay my tuition to a prep
school in Pottstown, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   I ultimately attended Notre Dame on a football scholarship.
After leaving for college, I never spoke with Mr. Tose again, but
he kept his promise. Whenever I needed money, I dropped him a note.
To the amazement of my friends, a check would arrive in a week or
so. My requests were fairly modest by today's standards, averaging
several hundred dollars a year, mostly for airline tickets to get
home for holidays. He also came through on summer jobs, some of
them involving heavy labor that helped me to bulk up for my new
position as a defensive end.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt that the arrangement I had with Mr. Tose was a
violation of the traditional concept of amateur principles. At its
first annual convention in 1906, the National Collegiate Athletic
Association included among violations of amateurism, ``the offering
of inducements to players to enter colleges or universities because
of their athletic abilities, or supporting and maintaining players
while students because of their athletic abilities.''
</P>
<P>
   (When contacted last week, Leonard Tose, who lives in
Philadelphia, said that any assistance he provided to Sack was
``absolutely legal'' under NCAA rules.)
</P>
<P>
   If violating amateur rules is a mortal sin, Mr. Tose and I are
going to burn in hell. I should add, however, that unless God
suffers from the same historical amnesia as most modern
sportswriters, the NCAA and the college presidents it represents
are going to be right there with us. Not only did the 1906
legislation prohibit gifts from alumni and boosters, it also
prohibited financial inducements to athletes from any athletic
organization, including university athletic departments. The
principle of amateurism clearly forbids the awarding of athletic
scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until 1956 that the NCAA, responding to the demands
of the burgeoning college sports industry, changed its constitution
and bylaws to allow colleges to pay the educational and living
expenses of talented athletes, many of whom had no financial need
or remarkable academic ability. This landmark decision ushered in
the era of NCAA-sponsored professionalism. In the years that
followed, the NCAA passed rules that gave coaches the kind of
control over athletes one usually associates with employment.
</P>
<P>
   When viewed in light of the historical record, the athletic
scholarship I received from Notre Dame was just as much a violation
of amateurism as the financial arrangement I had with Leonard Tose.
In other words, when the NCAA investigates what it calls ``improper
benefits,'' the issue is not amateurism but the violation of a
system of rules whose primary purpose is to enforce an
industry-wide salary cap. College athletes are already being paid;
the industry simply wants to keep tight controls on how much and by
whom.
</P>
<P>
   The reason the NCAA has used its substantial legal and public
relations resources to support the fiction that scholarship
athletes are merely amateurs engaged in sport during their free
time is obvious. If scholarship athletes were recognized as the
paid entertainers they have in fact become, the college sports
industry would be subject to unrelated business income taxes,
antitrust scrutiny and demands by players for a bigger share of the
revenue. Amateurism is the ultimate tax shelter.
</P>
<P>
   When I walked out of the Warwick Hotel the other night, I felt
more strongly than ever that it is the NCAA that should be under
investigation, not the players, agents and boosters who refuse to
accept its phony amateur code. The NCAA has evolved from being a
defender of amateur principles into an economic cartel that
cynically manipulates the concept of amateurism to serve its
financial interests. Nothing short of a class-action lawsuit by
players is likely to bring about meaningful reform.
</P>
<P>
   When that happens, I will take Mr. Tose out to dinner to
celebrate; only this time, the bill is on me.
</P>

TAIWAN NATIONALISTS LOSE PRESIDENCY AFTER HALF-CENTURY REIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to correct spelling of Lee Teng-hui in 4th graf; Lee Teng-hui
is correct)  
 (bl)  
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan _ Chen Shui-bian, an opposition politician who
long advocated Taiwan's independence, was elected its new president
Saturday, ending half a century of Nationalist rule and risking
dangerous new tensions with mainland China.
</P>
<P>
   Chen, a 49-year-old lawyer who served as mayor of Taipei and
struggled and against martial law in the 1980s, won with 39 percent
of the vote in a bitter three-way race. The Nationalist candidate
slumped to third place.
</P>
<P>
   Chen's victory, the first transition of power in Taiwan's young
democracy, was made possible by a schism in the Nationalist Party
that led one of its leaders, James Soong, to mount an independent
candidacy. Soong, a populist former governor of Taipei province,
came in second with a strong 37 percent showing; Vice President
Lien Chan, the Nationalist candidate, got just 23 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Chen and his Democratic Progressive Party called for
independence from the mainland, which considers Taiwan a wayward
region that must return to the motherland. The president-elect, who
will take office May 20, succeeding Taiwan's first elected
president, Lee Teng-hui, has recently moderated that position,
saying no declaration of independence is needed because Taiwan is
already sovereign.
</P>
<P>
   But Beijing has called Chen deceitful and issued dire warnings
against his election, with Prime Minister Zhu Rongji all but saying
last week that it could provoke a war.
</P>
<P>
   To reassure nervous citizens and governments abroad _ including
Washington, which has pledged to help Taiwan defend itself if
attacked _ Chen tried to reach out to the Chinese in his victory
speech Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   He avoided inflammatory references to Taiwanese ``statehood,''
and said he would seek deeper economic ties and ``a permanent
peace.'' He has promised he will not declare independence or hold a
referendum on the issue unless Taiwan comes under attack.
</P>
<P>
   However, in a statement certain to anger Beijing, he also
pledged, ``We won't let Taiwan become another Hong Kong or Macau.''
Those former colonies have been handed back to China, which has
granted them broad autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In a brief statement read on Chinese television, Beijing said it
would adopt a wait-and-see attitude toward Taiwan's new leader, and
reiterated its view that Taiwan is part of Chinese territory.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, President Clinton said he saw the election as a
demonstration of the vitality of democracy and an opportunity for
Taiwan and China to open a new dialogue.``The United States
strongly supports such dialogue and is committed to promoting
peace, stability and prosperity in the region,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Some 83 percent of Taiwan's voters turned out after a campaign
dominated by worries over relations with China and public
impatience with the corrupt political practices of the
Nationalists.
</P>
<P>
   Chen faces a legislature still dominated by the Nationalists,
who have ruled firmly since Chiang Kai-shek retreated here from the
Communist-dominated mainland in 1949. Taiwan is in for a period of
unprecedented political reshuffling and uncertainty, even as it
faces a possible confrontation with China.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Speaking to thousands of cheering supporters, Chen declared
Saturday night that his success ``is not a victory for the
Democratic Progressive Party _ it is a victory for democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   In a subtle friendly gesture to China and to some of his
fiercest enemies at home _ those who fled the mainland after the
Communist victory in 1949 _ Chen gave his acceptance speech in
Mandarin Chinese rather than in the Taiwanese dialect he often used
in campaign rallies.
</P>
<P>
   But Chen refuses to accept China's hallowed notion of ``One
China,'' and in answer to a question Saturday night he said China's
``one country, two systems'' formula for enlisting Taiwan as an
autonomous region ``would never be accepted by the Taiwanese
people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are determined to defend this island but we are also
determined to seek peace and stability,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to reassure foreign governments that he will not
take reckless actions, Chen has promised to retain the current
defense minister, top national security officials and the military
chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   Chen, like 85 percent of the island's population and many
supporters of his political party, is considered an ethnic
Taiwanese, descended from people who immigrated from the mainland
centuries ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Taiwanese resentment of the brutal takeover of their island
by Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists in the late 1940s eventually
spawned a dissident movement for democracy and independence. In the
1970s and '80s, early leaders of what would later become the
Democratic Progressive Party were imprisoned.
</P>
<P>
   Chen became involved as a defense lawyer for the dissidents and
then entered politics after martial law was lifted in 1987 and the
Democratic Progressives became the main opposition party. For many
of the party's supporters, Saturday night's victory is an emotional
culmination of decades of struggle.
</P>
<P>
   The Nationalists, for their part, have been thrown into turmoil
and their powerful chairman, President Lee Teng-hui, is now on the
spot. Lee's feud with Soong helped cause the devastating defeat,
and the party could suffer a permanent split if the popular Soong
tries to form his own party now.
</P>
<P>
   Soong apologized to his supporters for losing, but did not say
whether he would seek to form a new party or try to take over the
Nationalist Party.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Already Saturday night, Huang Quen-huei, the secretary general
of the Nationalists, offered his resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Late Saturday night, a large crowd of Soong's supporters, most
of then longtime Nationalists who felt Lee had betrayed the party
by snubbing Soong, marched to Lee's official residence and his
party's headquarters in central Taipei to shout for Lee to step
down as party boss. Both buildings were surrounded by riot police
and there were some scuffles.
</P>
<P>
   Chen has called for public disclosure of the Nationalists'
multibillion-dollar investments and confiscation of any properties
that should belong to the state rather than the party.
</P>
<P>
   But Chen also said Saturday night that he bore no animosity
toward his campaign opponents and that he hoped to work with the
Nationalists to build a ``cross-party alliance,'' though he did not
offer specifics.
</P>
<P>
   His ability to forge a coalition will be crucial to his success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chen Shui-bian's immediate challenge is that he has to act as
a president, not just a leader of an opposition movement,'' said
Chu Yun-han, a political scientist at National Taiwan University.
``Nearly two-thirds of the electorate didn't vote for him, and many
are deeply suspicious of his approach to the mainland.''
</P>
<P>
   The defeated Nationalist candidate, Lien, had used scare tactics
in the final weeks of the campaign, suggesting that Chen could
bring disaster to the island.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night he was more gracious in conceding, calling the
transition a milestone for Taiwan's democracy. ``I hope the new
president will handle state matters properly, leading our country
into a new era,'' he said before a crestfallen line of party
leaders. ``We can still regroup. From today we need to engage in
self-examination and reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee remained silent and secluded in his residence, where he
summoned the military chief of staff and the defense minister.
There have been reports here of Chinese troop movements on the
mainland, although no one expects imminent military action.
</P>
<P>
   Chen's victory reflected, in part, a demographic trend that
bodes ill for the Nationalists and also for China's hope of
peaceful reunification: many younger people have no allegiance to
the Nationalist Party their parents long served, and think of China
as a distant concept.
</P>
<P>
   Since the first presidential election in 1996, more than 1
million young people became eligible to vote, Chu noted. And fully
half of them said in recent surveys that they were voting for Chen,
who is seen as representing youthful energy and cleaned-up
politics.
</P>
<P>
   China's military threats do not intimidate such people. A
typical example is Yang Jie-lung, a 27-year-old graphic designer.
Approached Saturday morning as he left the polling booth, he would
not discuss his preferences until his mother, a lifelong
Nationalist, was out of earshot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope Chen Shui-bian can win,'' he said. ``He's the best one
to clean up the problems left by the Nationalists, and as mayor he
did a pretty good job.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the mainland's dark warnings, he said: ``We are not
obliged to take any advice from China. We are electing our own
president.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in Lee's hometown of Sanchi, northwest of Taipei, voters
rebuffed the president's plea to keep the Nationalists in power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should I listen to Lee Teng-hui?'' asked Pan Yue-ching,
38, a homemaker. ``I have my own opinions.'' The voters also
appeared unimpressed with the threats from China. ``It's always the
same between these two countries,'' said Lee Fung-lin, also 38 and
an unemployed restaurant worker. ``They just shout at each other.''

EWING READY TO TAKE ON SHAQ

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PURCHASE, N.Y. _ It was 1994 when Shaquille O'Neal was spitting
his first rap lyrics into a microphone and gripping the endorsement
world as tightly as a Pepsi in his hand.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, the unglamorous Patrick Ewing took it all in.
Mostly, he was silent as his place as the East's most dominating
center was being threatened by the 7-foot neophyte who once asked
within Ewing's earshot: Who's the man?
</P>
<P>
   ``He feels he's the man,'' Ewing responded in February of 1994.
``I feel he's not the man, not yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, it is indisputable. Although the pop-culture hype has since
faded, O'Neal is the leading man in the NBA. With an earth-moving
body built by Caterpillar, O'Neal dominates everyone on every night
as the looming star of Hollywood's team, the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing has no illusions about this fact. Although he is prodded
by the challenge of facing O'Neal and the league's best team at
Madison Square Garden Sunday, he knows what a nearly impossible
task it will be to get the best of O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaq is going to get his points,'' Ewing said Saturday after
the Knicks practiced at SUNY-Purchase. ``I just want to slow him
down. I'm just going to play my game.''
</P>
<P>
   He can still hit the fade-away jumper. He can still whirl
through the lane on a vintage runner. Six years, and two
career-threatening injuries since O'Neal caught Ewing's attention,
the Knicks' aging center is still standing as an example of just
how pride can be turned into a miracle drug.
</P>
<P>
   No one knew what Ewing had to give when he returned from his
Achilles' tear 20 games into this season. It was hard to know what
was going on inside of him. He had been aloof, felt unappreciated
and pouted during his rehab. Members of the organization wondered
if his dark mood was really a manifestation of his fear that
everyone was right, that maybe he did not have a reserve of star
power left in his 37-year-old body.
</P>
<P>
   Three months later, Ewing has displayed proof that he still has
tread on the tires and a cashmere touch in his fingertips. It is
not the mid-'90s, but Ewing is averaging an impressive 14.6 points
and 10 rebounds a game. To him, there is nothing remarkable about
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Robert Parish at 37 or 38
still kicking my butt,'' Ewing said. ``So, I'll just let other
people worry about what's left. As long as I feel I still have the
skill, I'll play. I mean, I'm not as athletic as I was a few years
ago, but if I knew the things that I know now when I was younger,
forget Michael Jordan.''
</P>
<P>
   He laughed. But one thing that has not changed: Ewing's
confidence is still as stubborn as a grass stain. Inside, Ewing
probably has hopes of luring O'Neal into foul trouble and has
visions of popping jumpers outside his reach. It would not be like
Ewing if he didn't think he had a response for O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is pride in every game, not just this one,'' Ewing said.
``When you play against people who are supposed to be the best, you
want to play at your best. I've been that way my whole life.
There's nothing that's going to change. I mean Shaq's a great
player, and he's having a great year. Naturally, I want to play at
my best Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   In 19 games against O'Neal as a member of the Magic and with the
Lakers, Ewing has won just seven of them. Over that span, Ewing has
shot 45 percent while O'Neal has hit 54 percent of his attempts.
Ewing has averaged 26.3 points and 11.6 rebounds to O'Neal's 27.6
points and 12.3 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two ends of the court,'' an undaunted Ewing said.
``I have to make him work on defense just as much as he's going to
make me work.''
</P>
<P>
   Ewing's work ethic is unquestioned. Without it, he would not
have made it back from two devastating injuries. Without it, he
would not stand a chance of countering O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think in these type of games, one, Patrick does have
great pride,'' coach Jeff Van Gundy said. ``Two, he does get
himself ready. And three, great players play well against the best.
And O'Neal, without a doubt, is the most dominant player in the
league. Patrick's going to give it his best.
</P>
<P>
   If he is not a factor, the Knicks' chances of taking down the
best team in basketball _ and gaining confidence should they ever
meet the Lakers in the finals _ will grow dimmer by the minute.
Maybe Ewing's not ``The Man'' anymore, but he is still a factor
after all these years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I could still play,'' Ewing said. ``The naysayers said
I couldn't play. I don't care what nobody else says or writes just
as long as I feel I can go out there and produce. I have one more
year on my contract, and then I'll see if I want to play at that
time. Right now, I'm enjoying this one and I'm trying to do the
best job I can. I'm trying to get to the championship and hopefully
win it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still playing, I'm still productive. And regardless of the
injuries, I'm still a great player. Even though I don't have the
athletic ability I had younger, I'm still a great player.''
</P>

JACKSON DIDN'T NEED NEW YORK `HASSLES'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK - One way or another, Phil Jackson would have a chance
to return to the NBA Finals this season. If not in his role as
Lakers coach, then possibly in some undefined role with today's
opponent, the New York Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson and the Knicks discussed employment a year ago, during
the season, igniting controversy amid speculation he was angling
for coach Jeff Van Gundy's job. All that became moot once the
Knicks made the Finals, and Jackson was hired by the Lakers in
June.
</P>
<P>
   But he said his discussions of a job here ``never got defined to
any level. It was just initial kind of talks.'' And Jackson said
there wasn't much temptation to return to the organization he
played for and won a championship with.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, you don't fantasize about things like that,'' he said.
``The idea of living in New York is the reality. If you go work for
an organization, you live in a community. And that's a reality, New
York has its own set of positives and negative things that you have
to deal with as a person.
</P>
<P>
   ``And having been there, understood it, understood the press,
the type of life that you have to live, all those things, there's a
lot of intrigue about living in New York.... And the aspect of
having a life that's full of hassles, just one thing after another
about living there, that makes (it necessary) to have a certain
temperate course to kind of go through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said any bond he had with the Knicks has faded since he
left the team in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's really nobody in the organization even that was there
when I was there,'' he said. ``But it's still the same faces in the
city and the Garden. And the fans and the community is still the
same. It's one of those things where if you walk down the streets
and you played on a championship team, people still recognize
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Of greater intrigue for Jackson is the game itself, a matchup
that pits the defending Eastern Conference champions against the
favorites to win the West.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're playoff-potential opponents if we can ever make it
that far,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rice rises: After a six-point game against Sacramento last
Sunday, Glen Rice has rediscovered his touch again. After an
8-for-12, 19-point game at Detroit, he's averaging 20.3 points on
23-of-42 shooting (54.8 percent) over the past three games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just going out there and I'm focused, trying to do the
things I know I can do,'' he said. ``Just trying to keep my mind
free. I'm planning on staying in that zone. A lot of times when I
miss a couple, I go thinking about it too much. I'm just trying to
get back to the basics, go out there, play hard, the shot goes in,
it goes in.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaq attack: When Shaquille O'Neal scored 40 points against
Denver and Washington, he became the first Laker to do so in
consecutive games since Jerry West in February of 1970. O'Neal
could have hit the 40 mark a third straight game, but he settled
for 35 points in 36 minutes Friday at Detroit, before Jackson
pulled him.
</P>
<P>
   West was also the last Laker to score 40 or more in three
straight games, in January of 1965.
</P>
<P>
   LAKERS vs. NEW YORK
</P>
<P>
   Tipoff: 9 a.m., Madison Square Garden
</P>
<P>
   TV/Radio: Channel 4; KLAC-AM (570)
</P>
<P>
   Lakers (54-12) update: Their last extended road trip of the
season concludes with an imposing back-to-back set of games - the
Knicks today and Miami Heat on Monday. The Lakers are 23-3 against
the Eastern Conference, 11-2 on the road vs. the East.
</P>
<P>
   Knicks (40-24) update: After being upset by Washington in
overtime March 8, they've won four straight, including victories
over San Antonio and Charlotte. The Knicks finally returned to full
strength when Marcus Camby was activated last week.

CENTERS COULD BE TAKEN EARLY IN NBA DRAFT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ We interrupt the NCAA Tournament to assess the
level of evil it will visit upon the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   OK, that's a lie. We're here to discuss how great big centers
are disappearing from the league's landscape like fans from the
fourth quarter of a Clippers game. But let's take a moment to whine
about the NCAA's refusal to prevent its participants from playing
defense with their hands.
</P>
<P>
   The lane has become the scene or more silently sanctioned
grabbing than the back seat on prom night.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's why the centers aren't developing.
</P>
<P>
   That was dandy attempt at segue, but also a failure.
</P>
<P>
   No, we can trace the absence of pivot phenoms to a sociological,
hip-hop paradigm that suggests it is very, uh, whack to play with
your back to the basket.
</P>
<P>
   Let's play with our backs to some numbers.
</P>
<P>
   In the NBA's Eastern Conference, the short list has become too
long for the paper. Of the conference's 15 teams, 11 boast starting
centers who stand 6-foot-10 or less.
</P>
<P>
   Of the league's 29 starting centers, a dozen were born outside
the United States. Of the 17 starting centers who had their
umbilical cords snipped on American soil, only six (if you count
Elden Campbell, a longtime power forward) stand at least 6-11.
</P>
<P>
   So, perhaps we're experiencing a trend that features the big
center as something to be placed behind the Soloflex in your
storage room.
</P>
<P>
   Good premise, bad execution.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the Eastern Conference's top three teams start 7-foot
pivots, and the third - Miami - starts Alonzo Mourning, a
card-carrying monster center who just happens to check in at a mere
6-10.
</P>
<P>
   In the Western Conference, the four top teams - including the
Lakers and large, MVP citizen Shaquille O'Neal - all start 7-foot
centers.
</P>
<P>
   Where can general managers score a few more big lads?
</P>
<P>
   Well, the NBA Draft 2000 could feature four centers among the
top eight selections. The No. 1 pivot suspect is Chris Mihm, a 7-0
junior from Texas who is threatening to remain a Longhorn for his
senior season. Close behind is junior Loren Woods, a 7-1,
slot-blocking fiend from Arizona whose back has eliminated him from
tournament play.
</P>
<P>
   He's expected to make a full recovery, but insiders can't get a
feel for his interest in the draft; he'd probably be selected in
the top five.
</P>
<P>
   Our next candidates are Joel Przybilla, a 7-1 sophomore who
ditched the University of Minnesota midway through the Big Ten
campaign, and 7-0 North Carolina junior Brendan Haywood.
</P>
<P>
   Przybilla already has an agent, Bill Duffy (Michael Olowokandi),
but has yet to hire an offensive game. Haywood, who had 28 points
and 14 rebounds in Friday's bullying of little Missouri, goes about
270, which makes his skill for completely disappearing at
inopportune moments even more amazing.
</P>
<P>
   If the enigmatic Haywood leaves UNC, some team in need of a
center will choose him fairly soon, inspiring a collective sigh
from those GMs who didn't want to select him but might have,
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Wild cards who could creep up from the last third of the first
round are two players whose names appeared in this column weeks
ago: Iakovos Tsakalidis, a 7-1, 21-year-old who plays for AEK of
the Greek League, and 7-2 Soumaila Samake, the 22-year-old center
for the Cincinnati Stuff of the IBL.
</P>
<P>
   Samake, the IBL's reigning player of the week, has been
described as a bouncier version of Dikembe Mutombo. He had 15
points, 17 rebounds and 4 blocks in one game last week; most scouts
compare IBL competition to that of a mid-major NCAA Division I
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Schea it ain't so
</P>
<P>
   Local hero Schea Cotton, who's been through more schools than
McGruff the Crime Dog, has left the University of Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   If you had ``less than one year'' in the office pool, you're the
winner.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so Schea's latest maneuver may be miles less than shocking,
but he did list a serious reason for leaving the Crimson Tide. His
father, James Cotton, Sr., has prostate cancer; the former Bosco
Tech and Long Beach City College ace, who according to scouts was
considering a hop to the NBA, anyway, has returned to the L.B.
area.
</P>
<P>
   One independent scouting service rates the 6-5 Cotton as the No.
6 shooting-guard prospect regardless of class as a suggestion to
NBA people who may think differently. Of course, this service also
ranks DePaul sophomore Quentin Richardson No. 1, ahead of Fresno
State's Courtney Alexander, Cincinnati's 6-9 freshman DerMarr
Johnson and Morris Peterson of Michigan State; Richardson won't be
chosen ahead of those guys unless they are abducted by creatures
from outer space. Abducted and not returned.
</P>
<P>
   Cotton, according to three real NBA scouts we contacted, may
slip into the second round of this year's draft if other aspiring
college evacuees declare as expected. But the same scouting
characters think Alabama freshman Rod Grizzard, a 6-8 swingman with
a tight handle, 3-point range and no public inclination toward
leaving school after one season, could be a late lottery pick.
</P>
<P>
   It's not news that the NBA has been Schea's goal, so we wish him
luck. And our best to his father.
</P>
<P>
   Shot-clock violations
</P>
<P>
   With Donald T. Sterling making the final call, attempting to
roll logic into the Clippers' process of hiring a permanent head
coach is a waste of time. So let's waste it. According to Larry
Brown observers, the current Sixers and former Clips coach recently
sold his home in Malibu. Another tasty rumor involves ex-Cavalier
coach Mike Fratello, who does not have a fan in Elgin Baylor, the
Clippers' VP of basketball operations. This doesn't eliminate him
from Sterling's interest, but Sterling's predictable reluctance to
match Fratello's TV-analyst salary probably does. Four Clippers who
are signed through next season say they'd like to see current
assistant coach Dennis Johnson slide over to the big chair when
that time comes. ... Picked up on the radar of NBA scouts was news
that Eddie Griffin, maybe the nation's top high school senior, was
suspended from Roman Catholic High in Philly for his role during an
on-campus fight. But the school will allow Griffin to complete his
course work at home and graduate; East Coast sources also say the
6-8 Griffin intends to honor his commitment to Seton Hall. For at
least one season. ... The list of college seniors expected to show
off at the Portsmouth (Va.) pre-draft camp (April 5-8) includes
Long Beach State's Mate Milisa, the Big West Player of the Year.
... If the NBA wanted to score ratings points, it should have
slipped a microphone on J.R. Rider.

THOMAS TRIES TO STEAL CREDIT FOR RAPTORS' RISE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; LOS ANGELES _ It's not enough that Isiah Thomas has been a
woeful announcer and studio analyst for NBC since joining the
network. Now, he seems intent on using his national podium to
rewrite history, and secure a new job for himself in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas infuriated the Toronto Raptors this week by trying to
take partial credit for the incredible success the team is enjoying
this season, saying his long-term planning as general
manager/part-owner was a reason Toronto has become a surprise
story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate that NBC lets (Thomas) have the platform to put out
incorrect information,'' Raptors coach Butch Carter said. ``I don't
know why he's doing it. For some reason, he needs to take credit
for what has gone on here and I think that's a little broad for
him.''
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, if Thomas had any inkling of how successful the
Raptors would become, he would not have left Toronto 2 1/2 years
ago during an unmemorable 16-66 season.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't trade for Vince Carter. He didn't trade for Antonio
Davis. He didn't stick around to nurture Tracy McGrady.
</P>
<P>
   There was little evidence the Raptors would ever surge toward
the top of the league when Thomas quit. If anyone is responsible,
it's Butch Carter and Raptors general manager Glen Grunwald.
</P>
<P>
   Besides having the sense to acquire Vince Carter, they convinced
Charles Oakley to re-sign and were sensible enough to hold on to
McGrady before the trade deadline despite a deluge of offers from
among other teams, the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   But if Thomas said this, he wouldn't be able to push himself as
a viable candidate to run and coach another basketball team. His
name surfaced briefly in Dallas, and now he is being touted as the
leading candidate to replace Lenny Wilkens in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Who wouldn't want to hire him, if they believed any of his TV
comments?
</P>
<P>
   Tempting offer: Celtics coach Rick Pitino offered to step down
as coach in a secret meeting with owner Paul Gaston last week,
according to the Boston Globe.
</P>
<P>
   But Gaston, who owes Pitino four more years on his contract,
said he supported his coach and refused to accept the offer.
</P>
<P>
   Wish lists: Clippers guard Derek Anderson has put the Denver
Nuggets near the top of his list of teams that he will considering
signing with after the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've thought about it a whole lot,'' Anderson said. ``They are
one of the top teams. I have to be in a situation where I fit.
Right now, it's my choice and I can go where I want.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Maurice Taylor, he has narrowed his list to four teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have family in Orlando, so Orlando would be a spot I'd like
to go to,'' Taylor said. ``Detroit, which is my hometown and
Indiana and New York. Those are the places I'm thinking about.''
</P>
<P>
   Love'em and Hate'em: Miami Heat fans are nothing if not intense.
An Internet poll conducted by the Palm Beach Post asked readers how
far the Heat can go in the playoffs?
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-seven percent said the Heat would win the NBA title. But
38 percent said the Heat would be ousted in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   Triangle troubles: It's easy to get caught up in the hype
surrounding the triangle offense, when Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant
or Shaquille O'Neal are running it, but Bulls coach Tim Floyd has
had just about enough of the holdover formation from Phil Jackson's
reign in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may drop the triangle,'' Floyd said. ``It depends on who we
draft and which free agents we sign.''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: It's outta here.
</P>
<P>
   Even Bulls veteran Will Perdue endorsed a new offensive
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difficulty with the (triangle) is that all five guys on
the floor have to make the same read or see the same thing,''
Perdue said. ``That very rarely happens. I don't think this is an
offense for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   What's he thinking? The return of San Antonio's Sean Elliott,
the first pro athlete to return from an organ transplant, was a
heartwarming story this week, but not everyone welcomed the Spurs
forward back.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the dumbest things I've ever heard,'' Dallas coach
Don Nelson said. ``He had a perfect scenario for going out as a
champion. Why the need to come back, I question it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Nelson relented, and said he would support Elliott's
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I love the guy to death. All that said, if that's the way
he wants to live his life. I'm happy for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson should know something about disregarding common sense and
refusing to retire well before you wear out your welcome.
</P>
<P>
   The future is . . . dim: Utah forward Karl Malone isn't exactly
cheerful when he thinks about how the NBA will look after he and
some of the other older stars retire in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here are some young superstars on the rise now, but after
awhile, people ain't even gonna want to go watch games,'' Malone
told Penthouse magazine. ``I believe that. You know what the
quality of the game is going to be? Gimme the ball, don't worry
about a pick, we'll go one-on-one and break (the other guy) down
and dunk so we can be on SportsCenter.''

IMMIGRATION _ Sixteen and pregnant, Renata Hajnos must have

in Poland for an idyllic new life with her lover in Chicago. But
early this month, Hajnos was intercepted with several other Poles
who entered the United States illegally near Nogales, Ariz. Her

STADIUM _ The Arizona Cardinals learned a hard lesson last week in
the political reality of financing a new football stadium.
Lawmakers are in no mood to play ball unless the team _ or another
private source _ can carry a bigger chunk of the construction cost
for a proposed $341 million stadium. The Cardinals, who say they
generate fewer revenues from stadium operations than any team in
the NFL, maintain what lawmakers are asking for can't be done.

A CENTER'S LESSONS FROM GIRLS VOLLEYBALL
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ When he was a boy growing up in Haiti, Samuel
Dalembert took school trips and played games with a ball. It was
not a basketball, as it is now when Dalembert plays center for
Seton Hall. It was a volleyball and he learned important skills
from it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to play volleyball with the girls on the beach,''
Dalembert said Saturday after his team practiced in preparation for
Sunday's game against Temple. ``They used to tell me what to do.
They'd turn the ball to me and I'd just smack it to the other side.
That was exciting. Even though shot-blocking is hard to do, it is
really exciting. It's kind of like playing volleyball.''
</P>
<P>
   Dalembert, a 6-foot-11 freshman, used this technique well in the
first game of the National Collegiate Athletic Association
tournament against Oregon on Friday. He blocked six shots as the
Pirates beat the Ducks, 72-71, in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   The clinching shot, Shaheen Holloway's layup after a
floor-length run, was the highlight that made the newscasts.
</P>
<P>
   Dalembert could be seen in the corner of the TV screen, blocking
out his man and clearing the path for Holloway. And Dalembert was
important in other ways, pulling down 12 rebounds, scoring six
points and staying out of foul trouble until near the conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   In Sunday's first game, Oklahoma State will play Pepperdine.
Sunday's two winners will go to Syracuse next weekend as members of
the Sweet 16 for the regional finals. Sunday's second game is
partly a match of guards _ Holloway for Seton Hall, Pepe Sanchez
for Temple. It is also a match of coaches: John Chaney, the wise,
old Owl of Temple against Tommy Amaker, the young Buccaneer leading
the Pirates. But another important matchup will be among the big
men on the forward lines.
</P>
<P>
   Chaney said his players didn't have the quickness or mobility of
Dalembert, who weighs only 232 pounds and loves to leap, and looks
as long and lean as a numeral ``1'' on his back. But Chaney does
have big guys like centers Ron Rollerson, at 6-10 and 290, and
Kevin Lyde, at 6-9 and 240. ``I'm going to try to put two of them
in there and see if we can't make a sandwich out him,'' Chaney
said, referring to Dalembert. Lyde predicted ``a lot of banging,
physical play, elbows thrown.''
</P>
<P>
   Because he is 18 years old and a year out of high school,
Dalembert is still a work in progress and his game has flaws. He
tends to get fouls in bunches and that puts him on the bench. On
attack, his hands are not the softest. Occasionally, he will
accidentally spike passes from teammates. But they admire his
skills, like his personality and predict great things. Holloway and
Rimas Kaukenas, the senior co-captains, know as guards what
Dalembert can do to opposing shooters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody gets intimidated when you shoot a mid-range jumper
and it gets blocked,'' Kaukenas said. ``That's a big plus for us.
He's done a terrific job, especially for him being so young and
adjusting to college basketball so quick.'' Holloway said Dalembert
contributes away from the court to the team mood.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a great sense of humor,'' Holloway said. ``He's a
silly, young clown at times, which I love. The team needs the sense
of humor that he brings.'' As for Dalembert's skills, Holloway
said: ``If we don't have him this year, we're not where we are now.
When Sam comes ready to play, I don't think there's any big guy in
the country who can match him. He's still raw. He's still young.
Once he gets his offensive skills with his defensive skills, he's
going to be a No. 1 draft pick.''
</P>
<P>
   Amaker hopes that won't be for three more years, long after next
year's recruiting class arrives and ripens. ``If he picks up early
fouls, we're scrambling right away,'' Amaker said of Dalembert.
``He changes the game for us. He blocks shots. He can rebound. He
can run. A times, he can be an offensive weapon down low. We need
his presence. Our players are much more confident with him on the
floor.''
</P>
<P>
   And Dalembert, a self-confident person, said he planned to stay
free of fouls, play many minutes, and use his quickness to
counteract the Temple bulk while establishing the transition game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make them go up and down the floor and everything will be
good,'' Dalembert said. ``They've got big guys and we've got skinny
guys. I'll use my quickness to not let them get the ball inside too
deep. I'm not nervous.''

LOVE WILL BE TRYING TO CATCH WOODS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ The lead still belonged to Tiger Woods, but the
day belonged to Davis Love III.
</P>
<P>
   Starting the third round six strokes behind Woods, and in danger
of falling out of contention, Love played his best round of the
year Saturday, putting together an impressive display of power and
finesse that caught everyone's attention at the Bay Hill
Invitational. Love made two eagles, six birdies, and chipped in
twice. And he put himself in position to challenge the world's No.
1 player in a Sunday showdown.
</P>
<P>
   Tying the course record in relation to par, Love shot a 9-under
63 and closed to within two strokes of Woods heading into Sunday's
final round. Woods, who shot 67, was 16-under for the tournament
(200), two strokes ahead of Love (14-under), and six strokes ahead
of Mike Weir (10-under), who made a costly double-bogey at No. 18
when his tee shot sailed out of bounds. Love's score was the first
63 at Bay Hill since 1997, when Stuart Appleby shot 63 in the
second round. Andy Bean and Greg Norman have both shot 62 at Bay
Hill, but that was when the course was a par 71.
</P>
<P>
   Like talent rising to the top, Woods and Love distanced
themselves from the field, setting the stage for a Sunday that will
test Love both mentally and physically. Woods has beaten Love
soundly in recent head-to-head encounters, including last month at
the Andersen Consulting Match Play Championship, when Woods spanked
Love, 5 and 4, in the semifinals. Love is still ranked No. 4 in the
world, but he has not won in almost two years, since the 1998 MCI
Classic. Will Love turn the tables and end Woods' dominance? Love
admitted he was eager to find out.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anybody starts beating you, you start thinking, `Can I beat
him?,''' said Love. ``He thrives on that. Coming down the stretch,
he's not only going to play good, but the other guy is not going to
play as well because he's trying too hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great player. He's driving the tour now the way Jack
Nicklaus did, and Arnold Palmer, Tom Watson, whoever. We've got to
learn how to compete with him. Somebody has got to knock him down
in the dirt and make him think that he can lose.''
</P>
<P>
   But Love will have a difficult task, not only trying to beat
Woods, but trying to win a tournament that has haunted him with
unhappy endings. Love has never won at Bay Hill, but he has
suffered many close calls, finishing second twice, and third last
year. For Love to win the tournament hosted by Palmer, and to beat
Woods in the process, would be memorable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be great,'' said Love. ``But honestly, it would be
nice to win anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Woods wants to win everywhere, and his ability to close
tournaments has been a hallmark of his remarkable career. He has
won the last 12 times that he has either held or shared the lead
after third round of a tour event. Woods was beaten by Darren
Clarke in the Andersen Consulting championship match, but as Love
said, ``It doesn't look like it has shaken his confidence any.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods still had the lead. And he didn't plan to lose it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been a big believer that they have to come and get
me,'' said Woods. ``That's the philosophy I've always had. The more
difficult the golf course, the better that philosophy works.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods was red-hot with his putter Saturday, using it to either
make birdies, or to make key par saves. In a round that included
six birdies and just one bogey, Woods made a 30-footer for par at
No. 11, a 20-footer for par at No. 16, and he made a 12-footer to
save par on No. 13 and a 10-footer to save par on No. 14.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Love was hot with every club in his bag. His highlights
included a 30-foot putt for birdie at No. 1 and a 50-footer for
birdie at No. 11. Then on No. 12, Love chipped in from 25 feet
behind the hole for eagle, then he pitched in from 40 feet for
birdie at No. 15.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Love was at 12-under, two strokes behind Woods,
who was playing nine groups behind. Love momentarily tied Woods at
14-under with an eagle at the par 5, 517-yard No. 16, when Love
reached the green with a driver and a 5-iron, then made a 12-foot
putt. However, Woods recaptured his two-stroke lead with birdies at
No. 12 and No. 16, setting the stage for Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   While Woods seems to win almost every month, Love believes he
should win more often. Love will be 36 years old next month, and he
does not want to let more opportunities slip away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've let a lot slip away the past couple of years,'' said
Love. ``And when Tiger is winning every other week, it's hard to
find your week. He's the No. 1 player in the world. There's no
getting around that. How do you perform when you play against him
is the question.''
</P>
<P>
   Love would learn a little more about himself Sunday, in another
chance to measure himself against the best. But with two wins
already this year, and the only player in the tournament with three
rounds in the 60s, Woods liked his chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd rather be in the lead than behind,'' said Woods. ``If I
go out and make 18 consecutive pars, they are going to have to
shoot under par to beat me.''

 &HT;    Braves supply Venezuela relief
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela _ Onlookers have described the bare brown
marks left from the December mudslides on the mountains near this
city as tiger scratches.
</P>
<P>
   And that is truly how it looks, like giant claws have marred the
vegetation, leaving bare, raw reminders of the tens of thousands of
people who died in this country in December and the 150,000 left
homeless.
</P>
<P>
   But for a few hours on Saturday, there was another sort of
``Cat'' scratching going on and it was the soothing kind.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves' Andres Galarraga, returned home for two exhibition
games against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, along with teammates Eddie
Perez, Fernando Lunar and Devil Rays Miguel Cairo and Wilson
Alvarez, rode through those mountains to deliver relief supplies.
</P>
<P>
   They traveled to LaGuaira, a town along the Venezuelan coast 25
miles north of Caracas, where the floods were most devastating.
</P>
<P>
   In the early afternoon before Saturday's game, they delivered
10,000 pounds of medicine, food and supplies to a refugee camp,
along with plenty of good cheer.
</P>
<P>
   From the time he left the hotel to when he returned more than
three hours later, people flocked to Galarraga's side, smiling,
waving, asking for autographs, taking pictures, reaching for a
touch.
</P>
<P>
   As the van rode along the highway, peoples' faces lit up as they
realized who was in the caravan with its own police escort. The
trip took an hour, through the congestion of downtown Caracas to
the more peaceful countryside, where mountains were dotted with
makeshift brick homes stacked on top of each other.
</P>
<P>
   The vans passed through a tunnel which had been flooded and
blocked by mud only months before and emerged to a backdrop of the
sea and Venezuela's international airport.
</P>
<P>
   A few turns later, the vans climbed slowly up a bumpy dirt road
past waving children, to what once was an office building in the
making, now temporary home to 435 families.
</P>
<P>
   The shelter, which is run by the Venezuelan Red Cross, has
cinder block floors, with only sheets of plastic protecting each of
the ``homes'' from each other and the outside. There is no running
water.
</P>
<P>
   As Galarraga got out of the van in his dress pants and shirt,
sunglasses, Braves baseball cap and smile, he was flanked by
teammates and reporters, and soon after children and adults alike.
</P>
<P>
   As he began his walking tour of the shelter, he was joined by
12-year-old Juan Jose Mendez, who said ``Hola!'' to Galarraga and
then smiled and said ``Hola!'' into one of the TV cameras. He told
Galarraga what a good ballplayer he was and how he loves to watch
him play.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a fantastic person and very helpful to his community,''
Mendez said through translator Jose Martinez, special assistant to
Braves general manager John Schuerholz. ``I feel like he's a part
of my family. When he comes here, he brings peace to all the
families. It's a big emotion to have Galarraga come and bring help.
We appreciate that.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirty minutes after a presentation was made and the players had
addressed the crowd and signed countless autographs, they loaded
back into the vans. Galarraga opened his window briefly to give a
few autographs. He took off his Braves cap, put it on a toddler and
then waved goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel bad for them man,'' Galarraga said. ``We need to find
them homes, something. At least I feel better that we got some food
to them. So many young people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You could see it in their faces they were happy to see us,''
Perez said. ``I wish I could do more than that. If a lot of people
do what we did, it'll be fine.''

HOW TO BE RICHER THAN BILL GATES 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>

   &QL; 
(Undated) - Step One: Get a job on a newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Step Two: Tell a story. Some thing personal, if possible. Per
haps about the time 10 years ago when you accidentally re corded a
telephone conversation with your parents. And about how, since they
passed on, you play back the tape on their wedding anniversary,
just to hear their voices.
</P>
<P>
   Step Three: Collect dividends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mom and Dad died a year apart almost to the day,'' wrote a man
from Phoenix. ``I have on audiotape a conversation I re corded from
a late-night talk show years ago on KOY. It was a show live from
Las Vegas, and the guest was Charo. Mom woke up and caught me
listening to the radio instead of sleeping. I was 14. I told her
Charo was on the radio and that I was waiting my turn to talk with
her, with my recorder at the ready. Well, Mom wanted to talk to
Charo, so I gave her the phone. What followed were laughs and my
mother's beautiful voice in Spanish (telling) Charo, `I'm listening
to the radio here con mi hijo.' ''
</P>
<P>
   There were dozens like it.
</P>
<P>
   A woman with a tape of her own wrote, ``A couple of years ago,
my sister found some movie film labeled `the kids.' The kids turned
out to be my dad and his brother in about 1945. My dad died in
1958, when I was about 11. This wonderful film from before I was
born shows my father and his par ents and his brother playing with
my older sister, who was a toddler. I have watched this 10-minute
movie about a hun dred times.''
</P>
<P>
   The economics of shared ex perience allows even a hack like me
to participate in the greatest get-rich-quick scheme of all time.
All a writer has to do is invest a little time and personal capital
and the dividends come pouring in.
</P>
<P>
   More often than not, I keep the proceeds for myself. But after
years of raking in the revenue, the vaults of my mem ory are
stuffed with the stories of others. It's time, this once, for a
little profit-sharing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have many videotapes of my dad, who passed away (this past
October),'' an adult daugh ter wrote. ``He was in town from
Michigan visiting my fam ily and to see my five children on
Halloween. I treasure every video with his sparkling Irish eyes and
infectious smile. I would do anything to hear my last birthday
message on my answering machine. Every year, he and my mother would
call and sing in their off-key way Happy Birthday to me.''
</P>
<P>
   And another, who wrote, ``My pop passed away a year ago tomorrow
and my mom six years ago. I have the sound of her voice carefully
stowed away in my memory, invariably responding to my phone calls
with `I was just thinking about you.' And even though I am just
past 50, Dad always opened with `Baaby!' I tried to break him of
that for a while when I was younger, but it was a little thing
after all.''
</P>
<P>
   And a man from Sun City West, who wrote, ``I lost my mother last
March, and she would be 90 years old on the 15th of this month. I
have a video of her singing a gospel song, and I listen to it once
in awhile when I need her touch.''
</P>
<P>
   That's it.
</P>
<P>
   Call me selfish, but the rest I'm keeping for myself _ stories
about hearing a lost parent's voice on an answering machine tape,
or hearing them laugh in the background of a wedding video, or
preserved on a recorded ``letter'' to a soldier son in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no money in po etry,'' the writer Robert Graves once
said, ``but then there is no poetry in money.''
</P>
<P>
   It's impolite to gloat, particu larly if you're rich. But, hey,
Bill Gates, eat your heart out.

   GORE'S GRADES NOT ALL GLITTERING
</P>
<P>
   If Vice President Al Gore is commonly thought of as the sort of
fellow who during his school days would take notes in precise Roman
numeral outline, strive to ingratiate himself with teachers and
bring sterling report cards home, his academic transcripts go some
way toward subverting that notion, The Washington Post reported
today.
</P>
<P>
   During his school years, Gore actually was often an
underachiever. Though his IQ numbers and aptitude test scores were
well above average, his grades were uneven, never approaching a
plateau of A's and B's. His grades at Harvard, in fact, bear a
close resemblance to the corresponding Yale marks of his
presidential rival, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, whose studiousness
and brainpower have been questioned by some critics.
</P>
<P>
   Gore arrived at Harvard with an impressive 1355 SAT score, 625
verbal and 730 math, compared with Bush's 1206 total from 566
verbal and 640 math. But in his sophomore year at Harvard, Gore's
grades were lower than any semester recorded on Bush's transcript
from Yale. Gore received one D, one C-minus, two C's, two C-pluses
and one B-minus, placing him in the lower fifth of his class for a
second year in a row.
</P>
<P>
   REFORM PARTY BATTLES RAGE ON
</P>
<P>
   Although the Reform Party ousted him as chairman, Jack Gargan
met with his supporters Saturday and said he wants to ``solidify
the party.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Today is for cleaning up our own house,'' he said. Gargan, an
ally of Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura, and former party treasurer
Ronn Young were voted out of office at a raucous meeting Feb. 12 in
Nashville, Tenn. Gargan was replaced with Pat Choate, Ross Perot's
1996 running mate, and Ventura quit the party.
</P>
<P>
   Gargan and about 50 followers met Saturday in Las Vegas to
discuss a summer nominating convention. The Reform Party already
voted to hold its nominating convention Aug. 10-13 in Long Beach,
Calif. But Gargan said his followers will vote to hold another one,
even if it means having two conventions.
</P>
<P>
   THE WEEK AHEAD FOR GORE, BUSH
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore has $3 million more to raise to meet the goal he set
last year and also reach the maximum he legally can spend before
the summer conventions. So the Democrat is planning a fund-raiser
in Illinois on the eve of the state's Tuesday primary, to be
followed by five more fund-raisers by week's end.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president's busy week also includes opportunities to
heckle George W. Bush. In New York, Gore intends to harp on Bush
policies allegedly harmful to minorities, aides said. On Thursday,
Gore is returning to Houston for the second time in two weeks to
raise cash for Democrats in Bush's home state.
</P>
<P>
   For his part Bush is likely to tweak Gore with a fund-raiser
Friday in President Clinton's backyard, Little Rock, Ark. Bush, who
drained his bankroll of an unprecedented $60 million in his GOP
primary fight with Arizona Sen. John McCain, aims to build up $10
million by summer.

KARROS SURVIVES WITH STRONG WORK ETHIC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERO BEACH, Fla. - You can trace the origins of Eric Karros'
success back as far as you want. The sweat-filled days in
greenhouse-like batting cages of the minor leagues, or the
sacrificing of fraternity parties to work on his stroke when he
attended UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   But for Karros, the work ethic that's brought him a nine-year
major-league career began when he cut down a raggedy net while
attending Patrick Henry High in San Diego. He took that net, strung
it in his garage, had his folks move the cars and then spent
countless hours hitting off a tee into the net.
</P>
<P>
   It's that work ethic that's enabled Karros to prove baseball
people _ scouts, managers, player personnel directors, general
managers and more _ wrong.
</P>
<P>
   He calls himself a two-tool player, admitting his lacking of a
strong arm or sensational defense. Scouts chart his speed on the
base paths with a sundial. But here he is, his niche forged into
Dodgers history as an endearing example of what hard work can mean.
</P>
<P>
   He's hit 211 home runs, trails only Ron Cey for the L.A. record
of 228, has driven in at least 100 runs four times and is the most
recognizable Dodger.
</P>
<P>
   So why was nobody willing to take Karros seriously? Even UCLA
failed to offer a scholarship, instead making Karros walk on.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you come watch me for a couple days or a week, I might look
like one of the worst players in the history of the game,'' Karros
said. ``I also might look great, but I'm not the type of player
you're going to watch and come away saying, `Wow.' But over the
course of the season, I'll be right there with the guys you see and
say, `Wow.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always been like that. Right from high school. I don't do
anything really well, but collectively, I figure out ways to be
successful. I don't think anybody, upon first impression, is
enamored with me.''
</P>
<P>
   So when Ted Kubiak, who was managing the Single-A Modesto A's a
decade ago, saw Karros play, he said Karros worked hard but lacked
the skills. Karros remembers cutting out those comments, pasting
them on his bed and looking at them every day.
</P>
<P>
   It's why, a few years later, decision-makers within the Dodgers
organization said Karros would be fortunate to reach the major
leagues. Having a productive career was never an option.
</P>
<P>
   Even Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone, who scouted Karros at
UCLA, had a hard time projecting Karros as a big-leaguer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hit the ball hard and hit it far,'' Malone said. ``But
until you get to see a guys make-up, the intangibles... that's
probably his biggest asset. His mental toughness and work ethic and
will to succeed reminds me of (Cal) Ripken.''
</P>
<P>
   That's where everyone got Karros wrong. While everyone was ready
to bury Karros because his physical skills aren't as impressive as
many others, they never figured just how hard he would work to make
up for it.
</P>
<P>
   It began in his garage, and continues now. He hits in the
batting cages nearly every day of the season. Manager Davey Johnson
recalls seeing Karros working out in hotel swimming pools while on
the road, and during the offseason Karros keeps in condition with
intense workouts.
</P>
<P>
   Work is in his blood. Even last season, with a horrific 162-game
odyssey nine innings from ending, Karros was in the bowels of the
Astrodome taking batting practice three hours before first pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will never be embarrassed because he's not prepared,''
Dodgers hitting coach Rick Down said. ``We have quite a few guys
who have great work ethics here, and I'm sure some of it comes from
his success, and how he prepares, and the younger players see that.
He's consistent. And because of his consistency, he's overlooked.''
</P>
<P>
   Karros, almost begrudgingly, acknowledges his talent. But he's
quick top point out that the major leagues, as well as the minors,
are filled with talent. The work is what Karros believes carries
his success.
</P>
<P>
   In four of the past five seasons Karros hit at least 30 homers
and drove in 100 runs. The exception is 1998, when he missed 21
games. But he responded last season with a career year in which he
hit .304 with 34 homers and 112 RBI. The reward was a three-year
contract extension with an option for 2004 year. He's guaranteed
$24 million.
</P>
<P>
   With the new contract comes piece of mind. Karros has a no-
trade clause for the first two years, which means he no longer has
to keep up with the rumor mill that had him going to nearly every
other city in the league over the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past I made sure I was aware of what was going on
around me,''Karros said. ``Probably moreso than I should've, but I
wanted to make sure I was aware of my situation. Now, I can control
my situation.''
</P>
<P>
   In reality, it's the first time Karros can say that. He dealt
with the trade talk from his first season through being unprotected
in the latest expansion draft through trade rumors last season that
nearly sent Karros to Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   But, sensing public sentiment would shoot through the roof if a
trade was made, management continually pulled back. It happened
when Fred Claire was the general manager and the O'Malley family
ran the club, and it happened again last season with Malone as the
general manager and Fox in charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it gets right down to it, the Dodgers probably recognized
how valuable this guy is,'' Malone said. ``Once you get close (to a
deal) and analyze it, Eric Karros is too valuable.''
</P>

REBIRTH OF RESTAURANT REKINDLES MEMORIES OF LADY WHO MADE IT A
LANDMARK  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM FISHER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   GALLATIN, Mo. _ A north Missouri
landmark that brought a modicum of gentility to this land of corn,
hogs, callused hands and sunburned necks reopened Tuesday after
being closed for three years.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The McDonald Tea Room restaurant, a white structure southwest of
the Daviess County courthouse square, was crowded almost from its
opening at 11 a.m. And the crowds continued the rest of last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting calls from Utah, Illinois, all sorts of places,''
said Jean Kirkendoll, who with her husband, Bud, owns the Tea Room.
</P>
<P>
   Jean expects to attract not only the local lunch and contract
bridge crowds but also bus tours, weddings and family reunions,
plus the tourists who flock to nearby Jamesport with its Amish
customs, and the Mormons who come to the Adam-ondi-Ahman historic
site.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are coming,'' she said. ``The response from the minute
we started working last summer has just been unbelievable. They
were making reservations even back them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kirkendolls, who have owned the meat locker here for years,
bought the old structure from the local bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not for a whole lot,'' Jean said. ``But then you should have
seen the shape it was in.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple have poured thousands of dollars into renovations,
turning the building into a reproduction of a Victorian inn with
delicate wainscoting and 18 tinkling chandeliers, tablecloths and
quilted napkins, and polished staircases and gleaming mirrors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Virginia would be pleased,'' Jean said.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia, of course, was Virginia Prather McDonald, dead since
1969, yet still an ethereal presence in Gallatin. Those middle-age
and older still talk of her.
</P>
<P>
   In 1907 Virginia married Charles McDonald, a drummer (what
traveling salesman were called then), in Austin, Texas. They came
north to his native Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Here, Virginia fell ill with tuberculosis, spending several
years in semiseclusion in a small house just north of the structure
that is now the restaurant, but which in those years was the home
of Charles' parents.
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1920s, Virginia regained her health, her husband's
parents were dead, and the childless couple moved into the big
house. They converted part of it into an emporium, where they sold
groceries and snacks.
</P>
<P>
   They were also in debt to the tune of $8,000 _ then an absolute
fortune _ because of Virginia's illness.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Depression clamped down, Virginia had an idea.
</P>
<P>
   She would bring fine food to this place, where the standard fare
often consisted of a heap of meat and potatoes, creamed corn, white
bread for sopping up the brown gravy, big glasses of ice water and
a huge slice of pie. Farm fare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Virginia liked what she served to look nice,'' Jean said.
``Little pads of butter shaped like roses. Garnishments on the
salads like carrot curls. Her corn bread was round, not square.
She's put cheese and peas in baked potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of variety. And the portions were smaller. Not
like you'd get at a cafe. And the food, they said, was delicious.''
</P>
<P>
   Virginia opened the Tea Room in 1931. Suddenly, in little
Gallatin, there was a place to eat with real napkins, beautiful
dishes and glassware. Women diners wore hats and white gloves, and
men dressed in coats and occasionally even wore ties.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the Tea Room, the crushing economic malaise could be
pushed away. At least for the time it took to eat.
</P>
<P>
   ``What she did,'' said Joe Snyder, 82, the former newspaper
editor here and a friend of Virginia, ``was send Charlie down to
the train depot. Back then we had the Wabash and the Rock Island.
Charlie could spot the drummer 'cause he had been one, and he'd
tell them about this place where they could get a real meal, not
the greasy-spoon kind they were used to.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that started it. Drummers spread the word. And before you
know it she had people piling in.''
</P>
<P>
   Other people, that new breed called motorists, talked up the
meals they had here. That brought people from St. Joseph; Des
Moines, Iowa; Omaha, Neb.; Kansas City; and points in between. For
a couple of generations in this part of the country, a trip to the
McDonald Tea Room was a high point.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did it hurt that in 1937, culinary guru Duncan Hines, author
of Adventures in Good Eating, selected the Tea Room as one of the
best restaurants in America. It was on the list for 27 straight
years.
</P>
<P>
   There were write-ups in Better Homes and Gardens magazine and in
innumerable Sunday supplements. Another bonus was that Virginia's
cookbook, How I Cook It, was chosen by the Book-of-the-Month Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``Virginia loved the publicity,'' Snyder said. ``She'd go off
and speak in New York or Chicago or down south. She was something
else.''
</P>
<P>
   R.L. Woody, who as a boy worked at a big grocery store here,
remembers a woman in flowing dresses, high-heeled shoes and
large-brimmed hats _ said to come from milliners in New York and
Paris _ floating across the square.
</P>
<P>
   ``She'd tap on the store's window, and we'd go out and get the
list of what she needed for the Tea Room,'' Woody said. ``She
wouldn't come in. That wasn't for her. We'd fill the order and take
it around.''
</P>
<P>
   Snyder said Virginia's style rankled some.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some thought she was too fancy for us,'' Snyder said. ``You
know how people think _ do well, but don't do so well that you make
us look bad.''
</P>
<P>
   There was one story that J.C. Penney, the department store
mogul, had come to Gallatin from down the road at Hamilton, Mo.,
his birthplace, and that Virginia refused service because he didn't
meet her dress code.
</P>
<P>
   ``Completely false,'' Snyder said. ``Farmers ate there all the
time. But that was the kind of story people told on her. Maybe she
was a little eccentric in her later years. To me, she was a sweet,
old lady who occasionally lived in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Charlie died in 1951. Virginia held on 18 more years. After her
death, the Tea Room went through a succession of owners. But, said
Doris Lynn, a former cook, ``You could just see the business drop
off a little every year.''
</P>
<P>
   Jean, 55, said she and Bud, 57, thought long about getting into
the restaurant business. Once they made up their minds, she said,
they aimed to do it right. Jean has hired five cooks and 20 servers
and, being a good cook herself, will oversee what comes out of the
new kitchen, the only part of the structure they totally demolished
and rebuilt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have glazed ham, baked spaghetti, pork chops, steaks,
chicken, and all the nice salads and wonderful desserts Virginia
had,'' she said. ``The one thing we won't do is use raw eggs like
Virginia did. Look at her recipes and she loved to put raw eggs in
food. The state won't let you do that anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The recipes?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yes,' Jean said. ``I've got them. I've got them all.''

NASHVILLE NO PUSHOVER FOR KINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A casual look at the schedule would suggest
tonight's game with the Nashville Predator should provide the Kings
with two of the 90 points they probably will need to reach the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   But there is nothing casual about the second-year Predators
these days. They might have the worst record in the Western
Conference (25-40-7), but their four-game road trip clearly is
their postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, they rallied to tie Phoenix then defeated them 4-3
in overtime. A victory by the Coyotes, who have dropped three
straight, would have moved them ahead of the Kings for fifth in the
West.
</P>
<P>
   Nashville opened their trip with a 3-2 overtime loss to the
mighty Red Wings in Detroit on Tuesday then followed with a 2-2 tie
in Colorado on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   That makes three playoff teams the Predators have taken to
overtime in a four-day span.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an awesome feeling,'' Predators forward Scott Walker
told reporters after beating Phoenix. ``We've had three tough
overtime games against three of the top teams in the league. But it
makes things feel a whole lot better when you can win like
tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Predators have dropped all three games to the Kings
this season, their gritty work ethic always scares coach Andy
Murray. Last year, its first in the league, Nashville beat the
Kings three times.
</P>
<P>
   Murray watched the tapes of those games last summer after
joining the team and it shaped his approach to this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``There might be teams with more talent, but we will not be
outworked,'' Murray said. ``We saw the Predators were our first
game on the schedule and we made that game a priority throughout
training camp.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings won that game 2-0 and opened the season 4-1-1.
</P>
<P>
   Nashville has struggled on offense most of the season. The
Predators are last in the West with 183 goals. In goaltender Tomas
Vokoun's last 10 starts, Nashville had 17 goals.
</P>
<P>
   So it didn't look good when Phoenix went up 2-0 just seven
minutes into Friday's game then allowed a third goal late in the
first period after Vokoun misplayed the puck in his end.
</P>
<P>
   But Vokoun, who is 9-19-1 this year despite a respectable 2.70
goals against average, shut down Phoenix from there. Greg Johnson
scored in OT to give Nashville the victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I almost started crying when we scored the fourth goal,''
Vokoun said. ``I've waited so long and worked so hard. I think I
deserved it.''
</P>
<P>
   KINGS vs. NASHVILLE
</P>
<P>
   Time: 5 p.m. at Staples Center
</P>
<P>
   TV/Radio: Fox Sports Net, KRLA-AM (1110)
</P>
<P>
   Matchup: Coming off their first shutout of the season, the Kings
face a team they have beaten in all three meetings this season. The
teams last met March 4 at the Staples Center with the Kings winning
3-2 on an overtime goal by Jozef Stumpel. The Kings continue to
struggle on the power play. They went 0 for 7 in Friday's 4-0 loss
to St. Louis and are 1 for 32 in the last six games. Luc Robitaille
is tied with injured Ziggy Palffy for the team lead with 66 points.
But Robitaille, who was on pace to surpass last year's total of 39
has stumbled recently. He does not have a goal in his last seven
games and just one in 11 games.

CORA STANDS OUT FOR DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKELAND, Fla. -- Alex Cora began spring training bobbling
grounders, dropping a toss on a sure double play and with one hit
in 12 at-bats. He admits his nerves got to him in a terrible first
week.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later he's showing why the Dodgers moved Mark
Grudzielanek to second base, and in the process trying to close the
competition for the opening day shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   Cora made a pair of dazzling defensive plays and had a pair of
doubles in the Dodgers' 4-1 win against Saturday against the
Detroit Tigers. And no longer concerned with impressing anyone but
himself, Cora is again confident.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm playing the way I'm supposed to play; diving for balls and
playing hard,'' Cora said. ``That's all I can do. The first week,
that was not me. And everybody knows it. But I can't worry. If the
season starts and I'm in there, then I'll be 100 percent sure.
Until then, I'll keep working.''
</P>
<P>
   Cora remains the front-runner, but with a few more performances
like the one against the Tigers, he could clinch the spot over the
more offensive-minded Kevin Elster.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Dodgers' objectives during the offseason was to make
the defense better, particularly through the middle. With Cora and
Grudzielanek, the Dodgers got better at second base and shortstop.
Of course, there was some nervousness from Dodgers officials early
in the spring, but that's changed.
</P>
<P>
   Cora's been sensational in the field. Against the Tigers, he
made a sliding catch along the left field line in the third inning
and a diving stop and throw behind second an inning later. Cora
also has five hits in his last 14 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seems to be more relaxed,'' manager Davey Johnson said.
``He played a helluva game. But we made the switch with
Grudzielanek primarily because of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Terry tears it up: The lone ``major league ready'' player the
Dodgers got in the controversial trade that sent Eric Young and
Ismael Valdes to Chicago was right-handed setup man Terry Adams,
who's thrown six shutout innings in six appearances. His latest was
against the Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel great, like my fastball is back,'' said Adams, who had
a 4.02 ERA with the Cubs last season. ``Last year I sprained my
elbow in spring training and never got my fastball back. My
velocity was 91 or 92 (mph) instead of 96. I feel like that's back.
I had no confidence in it, but this spring I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends: Kevin Brown has two more starts remaining this
spring, but he looks ready. Brown threw 74 pitches in five shutout
innings against Detroit and has a 1.69 ERA this spring. ``My timing
rhythm was a lot better. I'm not disappointed with where I'm at,''
Brown said. ...Right-hander Mike Fetters was perfect for the second
straight outing, retiring all three batters he faced. But there was
a twist to his success. Fetters did it throwing mostly four-seam
fastballs, a pitch he was taught this spring by Sandy Koufax.
...More roster cuts are expected today or Monday. With starters
going longer, a few pitchers could be sent to minor league camp.
...Expanding his role as a utility infielder, Jose Vizcaino played
first base for two innings. ...Van Nuys native and Ventura College
product Brent Cookson suffered a concussion when he crashed into
the left field wall on an inside-the-park homer by Willie Magee.
</P>
<P>
   DODGERS vs. MONTREAL
</P>
<P>
   When/Where: 11:05 a.m., Holman Stadium, Vero Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   TV/Radio: Channel 5; XTRA-AM (1150)
</P>
<P>
   Today's game: Dodgers right-hander Chan Ho Park (0-1, 6.30 ERA)
tries to build off his first strong outing of the spring against
the Expos. Park has already been told he'll start the second game
of the season in Montreal. Right-hander Carl Pavano pitches for
Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's result: Todd Hundley and Chad Kreuter each homered as
the Dodgers beat Detroit 4-1 in Lakeland, Fla. Dodgers righty Kevin
Brown pitched five shutout innings. He allowed two hits, walked one
and struck out five.

NOW, PEPPERDINE HAS EVERYONE'S ATTENTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By VINCENT BONSIGNORE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. - The locker room fell quiet for a moment, it was
as if the significance of the situation had finally hit the
Pepperdine basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   In a few minutes the Waves would take the floor against Indiana
in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. A national television
audience was waiting, not to mention 20,000 fans inside the HSBC
Arena.
</P>
<P>
   These are moments that sometimes determine the mentality a team
takes onto the floor, whether it plays with fear or confidence.
</P>
<P>
   And it was a moment Waves coach Jan van Breda Kolff, who leads
Pepperdine into the second round today against Oklahoma State, was
well prepared for.
</P>
<P>
   Van Breda Kolff and his assistants had had edited a 12-minute
video tape of Pepperdine highlights from this year, then put them
to music. When he concluded his pregame speech, van Breda Kolff
surprised Pepperdine with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our guys didn't know we'd done that, so when we were finished
talking, I said let's go to this other room,'' van Breda Kolff
said. ``We put the tape in and all of a sudden our guys were
like..., I mean they were like...And I said, that's a pretty good
basketball team. Let's go out and show all these people that that's
the basketball team we are.''
</P>
<P>
   The 11th-seeded Waves then proceeded to dominate 6th-seeded
Indiana, 77-57, to push into the second round today and perch
themselves atop the national stage.
</P>
<P>
   The victory was as shocking as it was thorough, not because of
the outcome, but the ease with which the Waves handled Indiana and
the swagger they displayed in doing so.
</P>
<P>
   ``They took it to us,'' said Indiana's Michael Lewis. ``There
wasn't a time we were really in the game except right before
tip-off.''
</P>
<P>
   The 38-hour window between Friday's game and today's might not
be enough for van Breda Kolff to come up with another motivational
ploy, but maybe he doesn't need one. The Waves were a confident
bunch Saturday as it prepared for Oklahoma State, enjoying their
moment in the spotlight but not yet ready to give it up.
</P>
<P>
   The win over Indiana may have awakened the rest of the country
to Pepperdine, but the Waves weren't surprised at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expected to be here, we knew we had a good team,'' said
Pepperdine point guard Tezale Archie, who had a career-high 11
assists Friday. ``We're just glad to get the opportunity to show
the rest of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma State coach definitely noticed. The Cowboys (25-6) were
happy to avoid a top seed in the second round, having lost there to
No. 1's Duke and Auburn the last two years. But after watching
Pepperdine embarrass Indiana, they weren't so sure they had an
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the easiness in which they were able to beat the
Hoosiers surprised our coaching staff and players,'' Oklahoma State
coach Eddie Sutton said. ``They present a little bit of a problem
for us in that we really haven't seen anyone that plays the style
that they play. Their changing defenses, their trapping. But
hopefully we're mature enough to handle all the different
defenses.''
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma State finished tied for fourth in the Big 12, then lost
to Iowa State in the semifinals of the conference tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys share similarities with Indiana - both play rugged,
man-to-man halfcourt defense and are disciplined on offense. The
difference is,they're more physical then the Hoosiers, have better
athletes and their success offensively isn't determined by one one
or two players.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine shut down Indiana All-American A.J. Guyton Friday,
limiting him to three points and no field goals on just two shot
attempts. The Hoosiers floundered without Guyton and the Waves
rolled to an easy win.
</P>
<P>
   But Oklahoma State isn't as dependent on one player. Desmond
Mason, a 6-5 forward, averages 18 points to lead the Cowboys,
including 30 against Hofstra Friday in an 86-66 first-round rout.
But Glendon Alexander (12 ppg), Brian Montonati (12 ppg) and Joe
Adkins (11 ppg) all contribute.
</P>
<P>
   Point guard Doug Gottlieb, who played at Tustin High and was a
teammate of Waves forward David Lalazarian at Notre Dame, does a
good job spreading the offense around. But he's a liability from
the field, shooting just 36 percent for his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when (Mason) has played well and scored big it's
certainly a lot easier for us to win,'' Sutton said. ``But I do
think if (Pepperdine) puts that much emphasis on controlling him,
then our other people can step up and score.''
</P>
<P>
   Tommie Prince will guard Mason in Pepperdine's half-court-zone,
and it's a good matchup for the Waves. At 6-5, 215, Prince is just
as big and strong as Mason, who physically dominated Hofstra.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one guy we do have to concentrate on, he had a good
game,'' said Waves guard Brandon Armstrong, who had 22 points
against Indiana. ``We don't know how the game is going to turn out,
but we're going to play our game and try to limit him and his
points.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ In less than 48 hours, Pepperdine went from
unknown to darlings, and the Waves are enjoying their new status.
</P>
<P>
   That's what a shocking win over a higher seed will do for a
team, and their 77-57 rout over Indiana was just that.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were behind us (Friday), probably because we were the
underdog but also because a lot of people don't like Bobby
Knight,'' Pepperdine guard Tezale Archie said Saturday, drawing
laughter from reporters.
</P>
<P>
   But it's more than that. The national media here have taken to
the Waves' eclectic personalities, asking just as many questions
about their headbands and hairdos as half-court traps and
rebounding.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Pepperdine is one of the more colorful teams in the
tournament. Tommie Prince sets the tone with his 1970's Afro.
</P>
<P>
   ``The headbands come from a sense of family, to show our
togetherness,'' Prince said. ``As far as our hairstyles, there are
a lot of changes as far as the NBA and the NCAA. You see a lot of
people with Afros, braids and dreadlocks and that nature. Dr. J is
my favorite athlete, so I just wanted to imitate him.''
</P>
<P>
   Not like the old days: Oklahoma State coach Eddie Sutton has
seen many changes in 30 years of coaching, and not all of them
good. He is especially discouraged over the lack of friendship
between coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have the brotherhood among coaches that you once
had,'' Sutton said. ``I can remember going to those early Final
Four sessions where the (coaches) room was open and all the coaches
were in there discussing basketball. You don't see that anymore. I
can remember Mr. (Hank) Iba and Mr. (Adolph) Rupp on their knees
and one of them had Coke bottles and one of them had 7-up bottles
and they were trying to outcoach each other there on the floor 'til
about 2 o'clock in the morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Change of plan? Should Pepperdine win today, the Waves are
considering staying in New York this week instead of flying home
Monday. The East Regional final is in Syracuse next Friday-Sunday.
The Waves may opt to avoid two more cross-country plane rides and
another time change.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
MATCHUPS &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Pepperdine vs. Oklahoma State, 9 a.m. &QL; 
Second round, East Regional. HSBC Arena, Buffalo N.Y. &QL; 
Backcourt: Doug Gottlieb and Joe Adkins (11 ppg) give Oklahoma
State solid point-guard play and a dependable scorer at off guard.
The Waves counter with Tezale Archie (9.8 ppg, 5.7 apg) and Brandon
Armstrong (14.1 ppg). Archie is similar to Gottlieb with his
passing and court management, but he's a better shooter and steps
up to take important shots. When he stays within himself (a
career-high 11 assists Friday), he's effective. As Armstrong showed
Friday with 22 points against Indiana, he can stroke the outside
shot and get to the basket on drives. He's a tough matchup for
anyone. &QL; 
Edge: Armstrong can do too many things _ his quick hands forced six
steals Friday _ and he likes big situations. Archie and Gottlieb
are a push in terms of passing, but Pepperdine has the edge because
Archie has shown he can score. &QL; 
Frontcourt: Oklahoma State has size and offense in Brian Montonati
(6-10, 12.2 ppg, 72. rpg), a physical offensive and defense
presence in Desmond Mason (18 ppg, 6.8 rpg) and a big body in
Fredrik Jonzen (8.8 ppg, 6.8 rpg). Pepperdine isn't nearly as
skilled offensively up front, but Tommie Prince (9.8 ppg), Kelvin
Gibbs (9.1 ppg, 4.8 rpg) and Nick Sheppard (8.8 ppg, 6.8 rpg) can
all defend and score when needed, plus their size gives the Waves a
physical edge over most teams. Sheppard, 6-11, showed Friday how
important he is when he hits his shots (17 points) inside, which
opens the perimeter. &QL; 
Edge: Mason is the best player on the floor, and Jonzen and
Montonati give the Cowboys a versatility advantage. &QL; 
Bench: Craig Lewis (7.7 ppg) and David Lalazarian (8.2 ppg) have
played like starters all year for the Waves, although Lalazarian
has struggled in the postseason. Al Minihan and Cedric Suitt (6-10)
get spot duty at guard and center. Suitt came up big Friday when
Sheppard got into foul trouble. Oklahoma State goes two-deep on the
bench, with Glendon Alexander (12 ppg) coming in at guard and
forward. But he's the only Cowboys reserve of note. &QL; 
Edge: Lalazarian and Lewis are creative, energy-boosters off the
bench, and each can get on shooting rolls to either extend leads or
pick up a sluggish offense. Suitt is a shot blocker and gives
Pepperdine another long, active athlete defensively. &QL; 
Intangibles: Oklahoma State played in the deeper Big 12 Conference,
finishing in a third-place tie with Oklahoma but just two games
behind first-place Iowa State. Six teams from the conference went
to the tournament. Pepperdine has the momentum factor working _ its
big win over Indiana on Friday elevated the Waves' confidence to a
whole different level. They've enjoyed their moment in the national
spotlight thus far, enough that they may not want to give it up
just yet. &QL; 
Edge: Pepperdine is now a media darling but don't be fooled. To
some people the Waves are surprise winners, sleepers sneaking by
against higher seeds on last-second shots. But Pepperdine was
simply the better team against Indiana. They don't consider
themselves a sleeper and they aren't playing like one. &QL; 
Coaching: Jan van Breda Kolff has the Waves prepared and
consistently comes up with defensive schemes to confuse opponents
and take their best scorer out of his game. Pepperdine bought into
his system immediately, and credit his style for its success. Eddie
Sutton, like Bobby Knight, is one of the best ever, winning 656
games over a 30-year career. He's the only coach to take four teams
to the NCAA Tournament (Kentucky, Creighton, Arkansas and Oklahoma
State) and one of just 11 to take two teams (Arkansas and Oklahoma
State) to the final four.) &QL; 
Edge: Sutton is the proven veteran, but van Breda Kolff's star is
on the rise. The Waves may get beaten by more talent, but they
never get outcoached. &QL; 
Outcome: Oklahoma State can match up to Pepperdine's size and
athletic ability, and Mason gives the Cowboys the one player who
can carry his team for either club. Oklahoma State 75-69. &QL;

CLOCK TICKING ON EDMONDS DEAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. -- Of all places, Jim Edmonds might have spent one
of his final days in an Angels uniform in Hermosillo, Mexico, where
the Angels played the Arizona Diamondbacks Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Various published reports indicate the Angels have set today as
a deadline for teams interested in Edmonds to make a final offer.
The only two teams believed to be in serious consideration are the
Yankees and A's, as the Mariners are expected to drop out of the
Edmonds sweepstakes once they make a trade for the Tigers' Bobby
Higginson.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels will not confirm setting a deadline for any offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a deadline I'm not aware of it,'' Angels assistant
general manager Ken Forsch said. ``I don't know why somebody would
back themselves into a corner like that. We still have the rest of
spring training.''
</P>
<P>
   Angels general manager Bill Stoneman along with manager Mike
Scioscia and most of the team's front-line players went to
Hermosillo Saturday to play the Diamondbacks while the rest of the
team played the Diamondbacks in a split-squad game in Tempe.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels are concerned about going into the season with
Edmonds' status up in the air and it causing a distraction. But
they have remained firm in their demands for pitching that could
step into the starting rotation this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' Ramiro Mendoza would fit the bill, but Yankees
manager Joe Torre has been insistent on keeping him because of his
ability to both start and pitch out of the bullpen. Torre, though,
could be overruled by Yankees owner George Steinbrenner, who has
been annoyed at the Yankees' poor play this spring and who could
order a deal done.
</P>
<P>
   Other Yankees that could be included in a deal are highly-touted
infield prospect Alfonso Soriano, right-handed pitcher Ryan Bradley
(a Covina native and Ayala High graduate) and outfielder Ricky
Ledee.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Spiezio is beginning to wonder where he fits in to this
year's team. And with good reason. Signed as a candidate to win the
starting job at second base, Spiezio has played the last three
games at third, including two starts.
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia explained that Spiezio is his best option to back up
Troy Glaus at third. But Spiezio, who had been a third baseman
until the A's moved him to second in 1997, says it takes an
adjustment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not so much the ground balls, but the throw,'' said
Spiezio, who his hitting .323 with two homers and seven RBIs this
spring. ``At third you come over the top and at second it's more
from the side. It's something I have to concentrate on.''
</P>
<P>
   It's possible that Spiezio is being worked into a utility role
in anticipation of the Angels acquiring Soriano from the Yankees,
who could step in and start at second.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they use me as a utility guy, that's their decision,''
Spiezio said. ``I prefer to play every day here, I won't think
about anything else. (Scioscia) told me he wanted to get me a
couple games at third just in case anything happened to Troy.''
</P>
<P>
   The uncertainty of his status does not bother him, Spiezio said,
not after what happened last season with the A's, which included a
demotion to the minor leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can deal with last year, I can deal with a lot of
stuff,'' he said. ``My head's not messed up, it's my arm angle.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Candiotti's spring ERA rose from 2.16 to 6.08 after giving
up seven runs and 12 hits in five innings in the Angels' 9-3 loss
to the Arizona Diamondbacks Saturday afternoon at Tempe Diablo
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, he got hit by two line drives -- in the
same place and by the same better (David Delluci) in two different
at-bats. Candiotti was hit on the base of his thumb on his left
(glove) hand, and it was swollen after the game.
</P>
<P>
   Candiotti gave up three home runs, including two by Kelly
Stinnett. But he wasn't discouraged by his performance because he
was throwing the knuckleball for strikes. The problem was the dry
Arizona climate, which limits the amount of movement on the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking back over everything, I probably should have given up
two runs,'' Candiotti said. ``The (lack of) rotation on the
knuckleball was great. Without looking at how they hit the ball,
(catcher) Matt (Walbeck) said I was locating it well. I try not to
gauge how what happens, but how the ball is coming out of my
hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Candiotti wasn't the only 40-something (42) pitcher on the mound
Saturday. Forty-year-old Mike Morgan started for the Diamondbacks.

UNDERMANNED RANGERS ENHANCE PLAYOFF CHANCES  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The Rangers found themselves in an
all-too-familiar position Saturday afternoon: clinging to a
one-goal lead in the third period like a prizefighter trying to
survive the final round of a championship bout.
</P>
<P>
   Too many times this season, according to the team's captain,
Brian Leetch, the Rangers have left points on the table in such
situations. Not this time.
</P>
<P>
   With two-thirds of their top line out of the lineup because of
injury, the Rangers received two goals from Valery Kamensky and a
tie-breaking score from Mathieu Schneider, and held on for a 3-2
victory over the Eric Lindros-less Philadelphia Flyers at First
Union Center.
</P>
<P>
   The come-from-behind effort kept the Rangers, who received an
outstanding performance from the backup goaltender Kirk McLean,
right in the thick of the Eastern Conference playoff race.
</P>
<P>
   Coupled with Pittsburgh's 3-2 loss in Boston, the Rangers
(29-33-11-3) moved back into a tie with the Penguins for the eighth
playoff spot with 72 points. Eight teams in each conference qualify
for the postseason. Montreal, in the seventh playoff spot with 73
points, beat Carolina, which is in the 10th spot with 70 points, by
3-2 Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers _ who were without Petr Nedved (bruised ribs) and
Jan Hlavac (hip pointer) Saturday _ have played 73 games this
season, to 71 for Pittsburgh. The Canadiens and Hurricanes will
have played 72 games after Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   And that makes Sunday night's contest in Pittsburgh as big a
game as the Rangers have played all season long.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've given up the lead so many times, it was nice to hold on
to one,'' Adam Graves said before the Rangers flew to Pittsburgh.
``Especially against the Flyers. But with that said, we have to
take this into tomorrow night or it doesn't mean anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers cannot afford to wallow too long in the aftermath of
their first victory over Philadelphia this season. And that is
because Saturday's victory was just the Rangers' second in their
last seven games (2-4-1). Still, it could not have come at a better
time. Or against a tougher team from the Rangers' standpoint, with
or without Lindros, who is flying to Chicago for a Monday
appointment with a doctor who specializes in concussions.
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers had manhandled the Rangers by a combined score of 7-0
during the teams' first two meetings early this season, before
rallying back from a one-goal, third-period deficit for a 3-2
victory at Madison Square Garden on Feb. 20. Since the Rangers ran
off nine victories in 10 games from Jan.5 to 25, they have
squandered at least a dozen points in the standing because of their
inability to hang on to third-period leads.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a little bit of a problem late in the third period when
we were playing half-ice hockey,'' said Coach John Muckler, who was
nevertheless pleased with the Rangers' all-around effort.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers were a little like Weebles all afternoon: no matter
how much the bigger Flyers knocked them around, the Rangers
wobbled, but got right back up and kept on plugging away.
</P>
<P>
   Kamensky, who now has 12 goals this season, has scored four in
the last four games. Both of Kamensky's tallies (at 5 minutes 4
seconds and at 8:51 of the first) came in response to goals by the
Philadelphia rookie Simon Gagne (at 1:01, on the game's first shot
and at 8:14).
</P>
<P>
   And after Schneider blasted a one-timer from the right point
past John Vanbiesbrouck at 13:24 of the second, the Rangers took
what has become for them the dreaded one-goal lead into the third
period.
</P>
<P>
   They did not add to it. In fact, they played most of the final
period in a shell. But the Rangers did not relinquish the lead
either. Progress sometimes comes in small increments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know a lot of people don't think we can make it,'' said Tim
Taylor, who, with his linemates Rob DiMaio and Eric Lacroix, earned
Muckler's praise for their work with defensemen Stephane Quintal
and Rich Pilon on the Flyers' line of John LeClair, Keith Primeau
and Keith Jones. ``But we believe we can make it. And it's going to
be a great thing when we do.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people talk about all the money we're making. But the
money means nothing. I think earlier in the season we were thinking
we should kill teams offensively because we make so much money as a
team. But we don't have to blow teams out.''
</P>
<P>
   They just have to find a way, like Saturday, to hang on to those
third-period leads.

RICHARDSON TO MEET WITH OPEC OFFICIALS  
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DAVID IVANOVICH 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
 
WASHINGTON _ U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson continues his
whirlwind diplomatic efforts today to prod the OPEC nations to
boost their oil production and help ease prices at the gas pump.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Richardson leaves today to confer with oil ministers from
Nigeria, Indonesia, Algeria and the United Arab Emirates, after
meeting Saturday with Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi in
California and speaking by telephone to Kuwaiti Oil Minister Saud
Al-Sabah, administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   He then will meet with his counterparts from the other
industrialized nations at the International Energy Agency in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson's latest trip comes just eight days before the 11
members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries gather
in Vienna, for what, arguably, will be the cartel's most critical
meeting since the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is trying to persuade the OPEC
producers to increase their oil exports substantially to overcome a
supply-demand shortfall approaching 2 million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Richardson has traveled to Saudi Arabia, Kuwait
and Venezuela, as well as non-OPEC producing nations Mexico and
Norway.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, President Clinton revealed that he had spoken with Saudi
Arabia's King Fahd, leader of the world's largest crude exporter,
to discuss the oil issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will continue to work with foreign countries to help close
the gap between production and consumption,'' the president said
Saturday in his weekly radio address. ``Several important
oil-producing countries already have expressed their support for a
production increase.''
</P>
<P>
   The OPEC nations already are pumping 1 million to 1.5 million
barrels of oil a day more than their existing production quotas
would allow. Some OPEC watchers fear the producing nations will
merely legitimize the existing production levels rather than agree
to bring new barrels to the market.
</P>
<P>
   Iran, OPEC's second-largest producer, will play a critical role
at the March 27 meeting. And it has many incentives not to go along
with Washington's oil strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Iran has very little spare production capacity. That means
Tehran, which now is enjoying oil prices above $30 a barrel, would
not be able to share in the benefits of increased OPEC production,
but it would feel the effects if world crude prices were to fall.
</P>
<P>
   Also Friday, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright announced
plans to ease U.S. sanctions on a number of Iranian products, from
Persian rugs to pistachio nuts, as a gesture to Tehran's new, more
moderate government.
</P>
<P>
   The oil sector was not part of the announcement, but a number of
oil analysts interpreted the move, in part, as a carrot to
encourage Iran's cooperation in Vienna.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, White House Chief of Staff John Podesta denied there
was any link between Albright's announcement and the upcoming OPEC
meeting. He did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans Saturday were quick to criticize the
administration's ``quiet diplomacy'' approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Clinton-Gore foreign policy towards OPEC countries has
crashed and burned, and the American people are suffering for it
today,'' Republican National Committee Chairman Jim Nicholson said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people deserve trustworthy leadership, not empty
promises, reckless rhetoric and radical, last-ditch proposals,''
Nicholson argued.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the OPEC nations also are beginning to bristle at the
mounting U.S. pressure.
</P>
<P>
   An official newspaper in the United Arab Emirates Saturday
noted: ``The most dangerous thing is that the (United States')
wishes have this time been transformed into threats, and the calls
(for increased output) have turned into orders,'' Agence France
Press reported.
</P>
<P>
   To address more long-term issues of oil supply and dependence on
foreign sources, the White House Saturday threw its support behind
some modest tax measures to help domestic producers.
</P>
<P>
   One proposal would alter the tax treatment for the cost of
exploring for and developing oil and gas reserves. The
administration estimates allowing producers to expense these costs
would boost U.S. oil production by 126,000 barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   A second incentive would allow producers to expense ``delay
rental payments,'' compensation paid to a royalty owner when
drilling on a lease does not begin on a scheduled date. Producers
would be able to deduct these payments in the year they occur and
thus free up cash flow for more production.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M, who had asked the administration to
include these tax incentives called them ``small but important
tools.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pleased the administration has taken action,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The White House also unveiled a plan that would take 2 million
barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve _ the nation's
emergency crude stockpile _ to create a regional reserve in the
Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Home owners in New England and the Mid-Atlantic states were hit
with whopping home heating oil bills this winter, caused in large
part by some supply and distribution problems experienced during a
three-week cold snap.
</P>
<P>
   The new reserve would be designed to supply additional heating
oil in the market in the event of a future shortage.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration also is backing measures to promote
renewable energy sources, produce more fuel-efficient cars and
trucks and make homes more energy efficient.
</P>
<P>
   In his weekly radio address, Clinton tried to reminded voters
that while gasoline prices ``are higher now than they have been for
some time, our overall economy is still the strongest it's ever
been.''

PREDICTION: THIS RANGERS TEAM IS BETTER THAN MORE POWERFUL
PREDECESSORS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. _ On a shelf next to Doug Melvin's office
desk, there's a stack of new baseball magazines, all of them
previewing the 2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've read them, and we don't fare so well,'' said the Rangers'
general manager. ``I saw us picked last in our division in one.
Most of them have us third. It's like we dropped off the earth or
something.''
</P>
<P>
   This, of course, has been an ongoing national theme this spring.
The trashing of the Rangers is pretty near unanimous in
publications and on the TV cable shows.
</P>
<P>
   Former Rangers Juan Gonzalez and Mark McLemore joined the piling
on last week, although Juan, in particular, appeared to be
motivated by terminal bitterness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it's way too shocking for a lot of people to believe
we could actually win with good pitching,'' Melvin said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Everything involved with Grapefruit League play thus far
indicates otherwise. Pitching is very much a strength. Other areas
are also improved. Run production is a scary unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, here's another prediction for 2000, this one delivered
with confidence:
</P>
<P>
   Although it's very different, the Rangers team that leaves
Florida in 10 days will be improved over last season's edition, and
also from the season before. The pitching will be a large surprise.
The defense will be much better on the left side of the infield and
in right field. Run production will obviously be down, but by how
much?
</P>
<P>
   In a total reversal from the past, the bats will have to surpass
current expectations for this team to duplicate a 95-victory
season. Less emphasis on the home run continued this week, when Lee
Stevens departed in a trade for David Segui, which is supposed to
bring the lineup a higher average, fewer strikeouts and a better
on-base percentage.
</P>
<P>
   But these Rangers can win 90 games and still be more balanced
overall, plus more of a playoff threat.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, does anyone remember recent history? The two
consecutive American League West titles? And that the 95 victories
last season were a franchise record and only three less than the
Yankees while playing a balanced league schedule, save for
interleague play?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel we got the deserved respect for the 95 wins,''
Melvin said. ``And somehow lost in the mix are such things as us
having four All-Stars last season, plus the MVP of the American
League _ our third MVP in four years _ and also that we've won not
only back-to-back divisional titles, but three in four years.''
</P>
<P>
   Hold it right there. How could all that be suddenly forgotten?
</P>
<P>
   ``We are being remembered and judged for one thing: playoff
results against the Yankees the last two years,'' Melvin answered.
``That's where we've received our most national exposure, and the
results weren't so good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can understand people having watched us in the playoffs and
said, `My gawd, I thought they could hit.' Right away, we were
disregarded as overrated, and that's what is sticking with us this
spring.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a bingo for Melvin. But there's also more, like the
departure in the off-season of Gonzalez, Todd Zeile and Aaron Sele.
With that trio, big numbers are subtracted in RBI, home runs and
pitching W's.
</P>
<P>
   For so many years the Rangers lived by the bat _ and died with
the wood in the playoffs _ so it's still a foreign concept to think
of this team depending on pitching and defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``But why not?'' pitching coach Dick Bosman asked. ``The other
way didn't work for us when it needed to work'' in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, few in baseball share Bosman's glowing optimism for
what left-hander Kenny Rogers is going to accomplish this season.
And Darren Oliver, too. Both were down the list of quality
free-agent pitchers available.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never been one to try and oversell our pitching
staff,'' Bosman said. ``I think this staff will be very good, and,
again, that's not overselling anything.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there are the other spring questions.
</P>
<P>
   Third base: Out of nowhere, 25-year-old Tom Evans, released by
the Blue Jays last year, has won the job with ``Boooo-shell'' glove
work. It's unfair to say he's as good as Mr. Buechele, but the
improvement over Zeile is immense.
</P>
<P>
   With two lefties now in the rotation, and a third when Justin
Thompson is ready, left-side defense is more vital than ever. More
ground balls will be headed that way. The question is whether Evans
will hit enough to justify his glove being in there.
</P>
<P>
   Second base: Still iffy, but Frank Catalanotto is better than
expected and Luis Alicea has struggled. Advantage Catalanotto, who
has an interesting bat, to say the least.
</P>
<P>
   Right field: If Gabe Kapler can hit a lick, he might surpass
Rusty and Pudge as the fans' darling in Arlington. A hardball
player all the way.
</P>
<P>
   Center field: Put a hold on that instant superstardom for Ruben
Mateo, but that's not knocking anything about Ruben this spring.
Going to be great; it's only a matter of when, and if he can stay
healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Leadoff man: Shortstop Royce Clayton has done a reversal from
last spring. The confidence level has soared, both in the field and
at the plate. He relishes the responsibility of leading off, and it
shows.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, even with the offensive holes, it's a team that's
actually easy to like, although nationally, many don't.

BORDER ATTRACTING DESPERATE EUROPEANS 
</HEADLINE>

   &QL; 
Sixteen and pregnant, Renata Hajnos must have pictured the ideal
ending: fleeing her dirt-poor mountain village in Poland for an
idyllic new life with her lover in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   What she got instead was a room in a central Arizona immi
gration detention center, where her dreams are in tatters and the
only Polish voice she hears is her own.
</P>
<P>
   Early this month, Hajnos was intercepted with several other
Poles who entered the United States illegally near Nogales, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   In one sense, Hajnos is another sad statistic, one more hopeful
immigrant risking life and limb to reach the land of opportunity.
But the Immigration and Natu ralization Service said she per
sonifies a new trend: Eastern Europeans taking advantage of
Mexico's relaxed immigration policies to get into that country.
From there, it's a short hop over the fence to the promised land.
</P>
<P>
   Although Mexican immigrants still account for the huge major ity
of illegal border crossings in the Southwest, the number of
Europeans and other non-Mexi can border crossers is inching
steadily higher, reflecting the ever-changing economic and po
litical climate around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Since October, the start of the fiscal year, agents in southern
Arizona have snared 46 Poles entering the country illegally,
already more than last year's total. Eighteen have come in the past
few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Last Monday, two Yugoslavs were captured. From October to
February, Border Patrol agents caught Ukrainians, Bulgarians and
Romanians, not to mention a host of people from China and India.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's experience mirrors the rest of the Southwestern
border. In one odd case last month, authorities detained 37 Poles
in Houston after they flew in from Mexico City under falsi fied
Austrian passports.
</P>
<P>
   The changing dynamics of bor der traffic are explained, in part,
by Mexico's revised immigration policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand they've really loosened up their requirements
for Poland, specifically,'' Border Patrol spokesman Rob Daniels
said.
</P>
<P>
   Since June, Mexico and Poland have allowed free travel between
their countries. Where issuance of visas was once tightly regu
lated, the two nations now allow an unlimited number of each
other's tourists to enter without visas.
</P>
<P>
   Marek Purowski, head of the immigration section of the Polish
Consulate in Los Angeles, said the problem could be alleviated if
the United States' restrictive and overly bureaucratic entry poli
cies were loosened. When Polish citizens hit roadblocks, he said,
they seem to take the Mexican route.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Rychtarczyk, 56, the mother of Hajnos' boyfriend, has been
a legal resident of Chicago for 10 years. Her son, Krzysztof, 19,
the father of Hajnos' baby, legally joined his mother and family
three weeks ago. Already, he has a job. But he was forced to leave
Hajnos behind.
</P>
<P>
   Although the mother offered to host Hajnos in a visa
application, Hajnos feared her own mother's two previous U.S. visa
rejections would kill her chances.
</P>
<P>
   With cash scraped together by her family, Hajnos left her vil
lage of Ludzmierz in southern Poland and headed for Krakow, where
she boarded a plane to Mexico City, her mother, Halgor zata, 40,
said by telephone from a neighbor's home.
</P>
<P>
   Left behind were Hajnos' seven siblings, who are surviving on
the equivalent of $80 a month in child support. It is a hard life,
with Poland's 11 percent unem ployment rate magnified in its rural,
underdeveloped northern and southern extremes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those regions have suffered greatly, economically,'' Purowski
said.
</P>
<P>
   From Mexico City, Hajnos made her way to Nogales, So nora,
crossing into Arizona about March 1 with her sights on Chicago.
Instead, the Border Pa trol had its sights on her. Authori ties
won't discuss their investigation, but they believe Hajnos and
other Poles got help from a smuggling ring.
</P>
<P>
   Hajnos now awaits an uncer tain fate. She speaks no English and
has no money. And as if things weren't bad enough, the detention
center was quarantined last week for chicken pox.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Rychtarczyk, who weeps over Hajnos' plight, said she has
hired a lawyer. She is trying to compile such documents as Hajnos'
birth records and paren tal consent forms so they can persuade the
INS to let her son marry Hajnos.
</P>
<P>
   Hajnos told the Rychtarczyks by phone Wednesday that she wants
to stay in the United States, but there are too many variables to
predict her success.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Ahr, an INS spokes man, said the agency rarely lets
minors in its custody wed with out clear parental consent. Even if
a wedding takes place, there are years-long waiting lists for
foreigners hoping to join loved ones in the United States. Even if
Hajnos' child were born in Amer ica, there's no guarantee she'd be
permitted to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``The road, no matter which way, is a long one,'' Ahr said.
</P>
<P>
   Across the distance, Hajnos' mother last week sent a message:
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell her I really love her.''

LONGHORNS' ROAD BLOCKED BY LSU
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ With about three minutes to play, a berth in
the Sweet 16 became a mirage in the desert for the University of
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   From that point on, LSU made the kinds of plays that teams that
advance make in the NCAA Tournament. The Longhorns didn't. So it
will be the fourth-seeded Tigers who move on to the West Regional
semifinals next week in Albuquerque, N.M. after a 72-67 victory
over the fifth-seeded Longhorns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just beat ourselves,'' UT center Chris Mihm said.
</P>
<P>
   Mihm finished what could be his last game in a Texas uniform _
should he declare early for the NBA draft _ with 13 points and 10
rebounds. But he converted only 5 of 14 shots from the floor and
missed 5 of 8 free-throw attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't myself today,'' Mihm said. ``I couldn't find a way to
put \Rthe ball\S in. I played hard, got position, but I couldn't
get the ball to go down.''
</P>
<P>
   Mihm's free-throw shooting was a typical performance on this day
for a team that converted only 8 of 17 shots from the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frustrating,'' coach Rick Barnes said. ``We got the ball
inside where we needed to get it, got fouled and got to the line
and didn't convert 'em. The truth be told, we didn't play very well
in the last few minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   The teams were locked in a 60-all tie with 3:04 to play. But LSU
scored seven unanswered points and snatched the game away over the
next two minutes. After Tigers point guard Torris Bright broke the
tie with a driving layup at 2:10, the game then turned permanently
on the ensuing sequence.
</P>
<P>
   First, LSU forward Stromile Swift blocked Mihm's short jumper in
the lane, then Swift hit in close from the left baseline over Gabe
Muoneke at the other end. Back downcourt, Brian Beshara picked off
a low pass inside and Ivan Wagner was forced to foul him to prevent
an easy breakaway layup. Beshara made both free throws with 1:19
left. A Muoneke turnover and foul sent Swift back to the line,
where he made 1 of 2 for a 67-60 LSU lead at 1:08 that Texas never
overcame.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, Swift's block might have been the game's key
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if that was the turning point,'' said Swift, who
scored a game-high 23 points. ``I tried to play good defense every
trip down the court. It just so happened I was able to get the big
block and it motivated us a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   More than a little, Bright said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That got us motivated,'' he said. ``Texas was looking down.
That was the turning point of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Mihm agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did a good job of sealing \Rthe lane\S at the end and
that's how they won,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ivan Wagner nailed a 3-point shot with 18.4 seconds to play to
pull Texas to 70-67, but Jermaine Williams sealed the deal for the
Tigers with two free throws four seconds later.
</P>
<P>
   Texas twice lost chances to take command. The Longhorns lost
most of a nine-point lead late in the first half (32-23) , built on
a Wagner 3-pointer at 4:39. But they scored only one more basket
before the half as LSU cut the deficit to 34-31.
</P>
<P>
   The other missed opportunity came when Mihm clanged two free
throws at 10:25 of the second half with Texas ahead 55-51. Chris
Owens drew his fourth foul going for the rebound of the second
miss, came out and played only 1:06 more, before fouling out with
5:45 to play. Swift hit two free throws on Owens' fourth foul and
LSU re-took the lead (56-55) on Bright's 3-pointer at 9:03.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time of the year there is a fine line between winning and
losing,'' Barnes said. ``When a four seed plays a five, it usually
gets down to one or two possessions. Things went against us at the
end.''
</P>
<P>
   Wagner, who scored a team-high 19 points in his last game,
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Down the stretch they came up with the bigger plays,'' he
said. ``And our free throws came back to bite us in end. This
doesn't leave a very good taste in our mouths, but I think we left
it all on court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel we gave the game away. We had every opportunity to walk
away with a victory, but it didn't happen for us today.''

CARDINALS, LEGISLATURE AT IMPASSE 
</HEADLINE>
 BC- STADIUM-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NENA BAKER  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Arizona Cardinals learned a hard lesson last week in the
political reality of financing a new football stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers are in no mood to play ball unless the team, or
another private source, can carry a bigger chunk of the
construction cost for a proposed $341 million stadium that will
seat 78,000 under a retractable roof.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals, who say they generate fewer revenues from stadium
operations than any team in the NFL, maintain what lawmakers are
asking for can't be done:
</P>
<P>
   The team can't stretch beyond the $75 million capital
contribution it has pledged without cutting into its ability to
build a winning team in the high-priced world of free agency.
</P>
<P>
   Personal seat licenses, or charging fans for the right to buy
season tickets, isn't a viable way to raise more private money in a
four-sport market like the Phoenix area.
</P>
<P>
   And the NFL is already giving the Cards a subsidy for the
project.
</P>
<P>
   At $75 million, the team would be paying 22 percent of the
stadium cost, with the Fiesta Bowl and other users kicking in an
additional $20 million of private funds. The Cards said that if the
team is required to ante up more, it will kill a deal that would
also generate new money for state tourism, the Cactus League, the
Fiesta Bowl and amateur sports facilities.
</P>
<P>
   But lawmakers have made it clear they're willing to risk
watching the Cards flee the Phoenix area for greener pastures and
put the top-tier status of the Fiesta Bowl at risk if it means
ponying up a public subsidy for the stadium plan.
</P>
<P>
   It's up to the state Senate to find any common ground between
politicians and pro football. The stadium bill, trimmed up like a
Christmas tree with 17 House amendments that raise the Cards'
stadium capital contribution to $170.5 million and force the team
to relinquish naming rights, moves to the Senate this week. If a
final bill ever emerges, the question will go to a statewide vote
in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somewhere in the middle, there is a compromise that should be
forwarded to voters,'' said Sen. Scott Bundgaard, R-Glendale,
finance committee chairman.
</P>
<P>
   But finding it won't be easy.
</P>
<P>
   PLAYING A SHELL GAME?
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers perceive that the Cardinals are playing a shell game,
offering an amount of money the franchise can easily recoup through
stadium naming rights, valued in the tens of millions, and an NFL
subsidy. The league allows teams with new facilities to retain a
percentage of revenues that normally go to visiting teams. That
would give the Cards $25 million over 30 years of financing.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Cards and the league maintain their plan is the
most innovative of 23 NFL stadium deals negotiated in the past 10
years. Beyond a new stadium, it benefits a wide range of
activities, they said, while allocating 85 percent of the overall
cost to hotel and car-rental taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can unequivocally say the package that's been developed is
unprecedented,'' said Rick Horrow, the NFL's facility develop ment
consultant and a professor of sports law at Harvard Univer sity.
``It will be a model for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   But lawmakers opposed to pub lic financing of stadium projects
greet such talk with exaspera tion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be happy to find a solution with private financing,''
said Senate President Brenda Burns, R-Glendale, who has the power
to send the stadium bill to a conference committee for revi sions
or let it die. ``I think having an NFL team helps the economy and
adds to the way of life, but you can't give blanket approval to
something. The components of the plan have to make sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Comparing the Cards' proposal to other stadium deals around the
country is difficult because ev ery project is different in terms
of size, amenities and revenue allocations.
</P>
<P>
   But team contributions to new facilities have ranged from noth
ing (Tampa Bay Buccaneers) to $180 million (Washington Red skins).
In deals that don't include personal seat licenses, the aver age
team contribution for a new stadium has been $54 million, well
below the $75 million pledged by the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   NFL Vice President Roger Goddell said the league has a policy of
contributing to stadium projects ``because it adds stabil ity to
the league in making sure our teams succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   But sports business consult ants say there's another reason the
league is concerned about new facilities: They add astro nomically
to the value of a franchise, at a minimum dou bling the worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand the public out cry when billionaire owners get
public financing,'' said Andy Ap pleby, president of General Sports
and Entertainment, a sports consulting and marketing firm in
Rochester, Mich. ``But at the same time, it makes commu nities
better in many cases.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cards, for now, have dug in their cleats on the amount of
capital they can contribute to a stadium project, as well as the
need to retain naming rights.
</P>
<P>
   AREAS OF COMPROMISE
</P>
<P>
   But Steve Betts, the Cards' chief lobbyist, said other amend
ments, including one that calls for bringing Arizona schools up to
minimum standards before stadium financing can proceed, may be
areas where compromise is possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this funding package needs to recognize the higher priority
of education, I think that can be talked about,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It may be cold comfort to the Cards, but they aren't the only
NFL team that has faced legisla tive opposition to a stadium fi
nancing plan.
</P>
<P>
   The Pittsburgh Steelers were forced to come up with an alter
native deal after Pennsylvania lawmakers blocked a stadium
referendum from going to voters in 1997. Art Rooney, vice presi
dent, said the key to success was support from the governor, the
mayor and other civic leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wound up piecing to gether a seat license program, got a
(subsidy) from the National Football League and then came to a
basic decision on our part to make a larger investment on our
own,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the Steelers upped their contribution from $40 mil
lion to $75 million to help pay for the $255 million stadium that's
set to open in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``Persistence pays,'' Rooney said. ``The basic message was:
We're not going to go away until we get this done.'' &QL;

stowed away in my memory, invariably responding to my phone calls
with `I was just thinking about you.' And even though I am just
past 50, Dad always opened with `Baaby!' I tried to break him of
that for a while when I was younger, but it was a little thing
after all.''
</P>
<P>
   And a man from Sun City West, who wrote, ``I lost my mother last
March, and she would be 90 years old on the 15th of this month. I
have a video of her singing a gospel song, and I listen to it once
in awhile when I need her touch.''

   Call me selfish, but the rest I'm keeping for myself _ stories
about hearing a lost parent's voice on an answering machine tape,
or hearing them laugh in the background of a wedding video, or
preserved on a recorded ``letter'' to a soldier son in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no money in po etry,'' the writer Robert Graves once

BANK SHOT ENDS RED STORM'S SEASON  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOE DRAPE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON _ There were two minutes left and Matt Santangelo was
stuck on the right side of the lane. The Gonzaga guard leaned into
Erick Barkley and rocketed a line drive from 15 feet. The shot
banked in and the sold-out crowd at the McKale Center roared the
roar that accompanies destiny and an upset.
</P>
<P>
   It was 71-64, and the heave that looked more like a pool shot
might have been the one that was going to end St. John's tumultuous
season with a second-round upset loss in the West Regional.
</P>
<P>
   If the Red Storm faithful wanted to believe that their team had
one more comeback left in them on Saturday, Santangelo _ Barkley's
backup on a summer team _ dashed that hope less than a minute later
with a 3-point shot from the key that turned St. John's desperate.
</P>
<P>
   With 17.4 seconds left, Barkley drained a fall-away jumper from
near the St. John's bench to cut the lead to 79-76. And Santangelo
missed one of two free throws with 15.9 seconds left to ever so
slightly open the door. But Barkley could not hit another 3-pointer
and Lavor Postell batted the rebound out of bounds.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, St. John's ran out of court. Tenth-seeded Gonzaga
upended No. 2 St. John's, 82-76. The Red Storm's loss came on the
same night No. 1-seeded Arizona was upset by Wisconsin, 66-59, in
Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   In perhaps a fitting end to a difficult season, the Red Storm
was booed as it left the floor because all but Bootsy Thornton and
Lavor Postell decided to exit before congratulating the victorious
underdogs. The Bulldogs? They were cheered once more as they hugged
at midcourt and bounded off the hardwood.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the second half, the Bulldogs took their first lead by
bombing from the 3-point line. Ryan Floyd lofted one from the key
to give Gonzaga a 40-39 lead with 17:49 left in the game. Two
minutes later, the 6-foot-11-inch Axel Dench stepped behind the
line to give the Bulldogs a 45-44 lead. But St. John's fought back
and with 12:58 left. Thornton _ after absorbing a hard foul from
Mark Spink that caused a brief scuffle _ tied the game at 49-49 by
making one of two free throws.
</P>
<P>
   For the next four minutes, the two teams dueled brilliantly.
Casey Calvary dropped inside for a layup; Postell answered with a
15-footer from the wing. Richie Frahm hit his first shot of the
game, a 24-foot 3- pointer from the right wing; Barkley answered
with a 3 to tie the score at 54-54. When Spink took a pass from
Santangelo for a left-handed runner, the Bulldogs went up by 56-54
and the crowd was behind Gonzaga the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   With 7:30 left in the game, Santangelo brought the crowd to its
feet by hitting a 3-pointer from the top of the key for a 59-54
lead. But Reggie Jesse put them back in their seats with a six-foot
runner. Less than a minute later, however, Barkley leaned in on
Frahm and picked up his fourth foul. Frahm sank both for a 61-56
lead.
</P>
<P>
   When Postell reached in on Calvary and picked up his third foul,
the Bulldog dropped them both and Gonzaga had a 7-point lead,
63-56.
</P>
<P>
   But Glover again asserted himself. With 5:25 left, he stole a
pass intended for Calvary, threw the outlet to Thornton and
followed the play. Thornton shoveled it back and Glover cut the
score to 63-58 with a flying lay up. The Red Storm would have to
scramble.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, St. John's Coach Mike Jarvis said his players
could look across the court at Gonzaga (25-8) and might see
themselves. The similarities were striking as the Red Storm took a
36-33 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   Like St. John's and its threesome of Barkley, Postell and
Thornton, Gonzaga's Santangelo, Frahm and Dench formed the core of
a team that nearly made it to last year's Final Four. The Red Storm
went down to Ohio State in the South Regional final. In the West
Regional final that year, the Bulldogs lost, 67-62, to the eventual
champion Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Each team, too, has had to persevere through rocky seasons, but
for different reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzaga lost back-to-back games against Cincinnati and Temple
early in the season and later dropped three of their last four
regular-season games.
</P>
<P>
   St. John's, on the other hand, has been embroiled in an National
Collegiate Athletic Association investigation the last six weeks
during which Barkley missed three games over two separate
suspensions. The investigation still hovered over the team.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs turned the ball over 24 times in their 77-66 upset
of No. 7 Louisville and needed 19 points in the second half from
Frahm. The Red Storm's pressure defense harassed the Bulldogs into
seven first-half turnovers. Barkley, Gray and Thornton combined for
five steals and hounded Santangelo and Frahm on the perimeter.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs' vaunted guard tandem of Santangelo and Frahm was
half its usual self _ Santangelo had 10 first-half points, but
Frahm came up empty. He was 0 for 3 from the field _ including a
blown breakaway.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Storm, meanwhile, survived Barkley and Postell's
combined 7-of-23 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   It was a different and explosive Postell who scored the first
two field goals of the game by backing Frahm on the baseline and
lofting two turnaround jumpers over him. His first half was
interrupted when he picked up his second foul with 13:37 left in
the half. He didn't return until 8:05 left in the game and was a
perfect 3-3. Barkley, however, struggled on the offensive end of
the floor. He was just 2 of 6 from the field
</P>
<P>
   Inside, Anthony Glover bulled his way in the paint and forced
Calvary to pick up two fouls in the first two minutes of the game.
The 6-7 sophomore employed every up and under move in his arsenal
to lead St. John's with 10 first half points against Dench. He also
helped the Red Storm win the rebounding war 19-16.

CLINTON CALLS FOR NEW RESERVE OF HEATING OIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS for new lead)  
 (HLW)  
 By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton endorsed legislation Saturday to
create a new reserve of heating oil to cushion against future
shortages in the Northeastern states, but beyond exhorting foreign
nations to boost their oil production, he proposed no short-term
steps to relieve rising fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he urged Congress to focus on long-term efforts to
reduce fuel consumption, including conservation tax credits and
research spending, which Congress has rejected when he proposed
them before.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no overnight solution to this problem,'' Clinton said
in his weekly radio address.
</P>
<P>
   He did not propose any emergency steps, like releasing oil from
existing federal reserves, which are for emergency use, or lowering
gasoline taxes. And he ruled out increasing domestic production in
Alaska by drilling in protected wildlife habitats.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that while the spike in fuel prices this spring was
hard on people with modest incomes who must drive long distances to
work, and on independent truckers (who have protested by driving
their rigs through Washington), the overall economy remained
strong.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bernard Sanders of Vermont, an independent, said that he
was ``delighted'' that Clinton had endorsed the legislation, which
was sponsored by Sanders, to create a heating oil reserve for the
Northeast. The bill already has 92 cosponsors in the House. ``I
think his support will give the impetus to get the legislation
passed,'' he said. Sanders said he also favored immediate sales of
oil from the federal stockpile to help bring prices down.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said the president's proposal envisioned a
pool of some 2 million barrels of oil drawn from existing federal
oil stockpiles, to be stored at existing facilities in the
Northeast so that they could be released during shortages or to
deal with transportation bottlenecks.
</P>
<P>
   They said the administration would ask Congress to pass a new
law establishing the program, so that conditions for releasing
heating oil onto the market could be specified.
</P>
<P>
   However, the president conceded that his other energy
conservation ideas have received short shrift.
</P>
<P>
   ``For over two years, Congress has refused to pass common-sense
tax credits I've proposed to promote fuel-saving cars of the future
and energy-efficient homes, buildings and equipment,'' he said,
urging Congress to reconsider.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's long past time for Congress to fully fund the more than
$1 billion I've requested to accelerate the research and
development of more efficient energy technologies,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The average price of gasoline, which was about $1.25 at
Christmas, has risen in recent weeks to above $1.50, and the Energy
Department now projects that it could reach as much as $1.80 this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Crude oil and gasoline stocks in the United States are at
``alarmingly low'' levels not seen in decades, the agency said, and
``as the gasoline season gets under way, stocks will plumb
uncharted depths if they follow their usual seasonal pattern.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of New York, a candidate for the Senate,
said Clinton's proposals showed that ``he has had a slight
awakening from his nap,'' and urged the administration to sell oil
from existing reserves ``right now.'' He said the administration
should also try to persuade Kuwait and Saudi Arabia to ``break up
the illegal cartel,'' a reference to the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a statement Saturday
that ``it is critical that the United States make clear to OPEC,
publicly or privately, that we stand ready to immediately release
oil from the reserve if the OPEC ministers do not agree to a
substantial production increase.'' Schumer is a close ally of
Clinton and a supporter of Hillary Rodham Clinton's Senate bid.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, who
recently visited Middle Eastern oil states, would continue to lobby
cartel members to increase production.

This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-to,

HIGH SCHOOL MORE FUN WHEN IT'S ON TV 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is there a teenager anywhere who can't wait to get out of high
school? &QL; 
The awkward growth spurts, the uncomfortable social situations, the
raging hormones _ it all adds up to one ugly time.
</P>
<P>
   So why is it so much fun to go back _ on TV?
</P>
<P>
   By which I don't mean a televised visit to a modern high school,
like in Popular or, until the gang went to college this season,
Buffy the Vampire Slayer. High school shows have always been a
television staple, since (and even before) the days of The Many
Loves of Dobie Gillis.
</P>
<P>
   I mean actually going back, back in time, on shows such as
Freaks and Geeks, which returned Monday from a monthlong hiatus,
and That '70s Show. Although the two are markedly different _ That
'70s Show is a straightforward half-hour sitcom set during the Ford
and Carter presidencies, while Freaks and Geeks is a more complex,
hourlong time-machine trip to 1980 _ both rely on their creators'
high-school memories to fuel them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can write a much more honest high school show if I write
about when I was in school,'' says Paul Feig, Freaks creator,
``because I really have no take on what is going on in there today.
. . .
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing we wanted to be is the guys in their 30s
running around going, `OK, what are the kids saying these days?'
and pulling out some term that's already two years out of date and
a band that's over, and we're like, `Oh, we thought they were
cool.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, when kids dance to a Styx song in Freaks, it's funny, not
embarrassing, as it would be if the show took place now and
everyone did the Macarena.
</P>
<P>
   But there is more to this than following the age-old adage of
writing what you know. While we're tossing about adages, how about
throwing ``time heals all wounds'' into the mix?
</P>
<P>
   ``The freshness of the wound has gone away,'' says Mark Brazill,
creator of That '70s Show, laughing. ``The humiliating time has,
God willing, receded from your mind, so you can look at it with a
sense of humor, as opposed to, `It was awful; they looked at me in
the shower.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a certain amount of time to pass before you have the
perspective you need to retell certain parts of your life. I'm 37.
But my perspective is so much better than it was at 18. I feel like
I see (high school days) pretty clearly. It actually makes me happy
to think about. It was a pretty good time.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years after your last wedgie, at least, it seems like it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tragedy plus time equals comedy,'' Feig says. ``It's a bit of
an archaeology, going back and finding the roots of your personal
civilization.''
</P>
<P>
   And the beauty of this science is that, although it's based on
the writers' lives (so much so that Brazill uses his yearbooks for
research), it doesn't demand total accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone who ever stood in the shower after football practice in
ninth grade, paralyzed with angry fear because a couple of
sophomores hit you with soap and dared you to do something about
it, would like the chance to rewrite history. (Purely theoretical
example, mind you.)
</P>
<P>
   These guys get to.
</P>
<P>
   Times have changed as well. Some of the funniest moments in That
'70s Show revolve on the characters _ gasp _ smoking dope.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marijuana was kind of funny at that time,'' Brazill says.
``Cheech and Chong were like the Jim Carrey of that decade. Now?
God, the whole country has a completely different attitude about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, theirs was not just an artistic decision. There are
business concerns to setting the shows in the past, as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``A show about high school 20 years ago is going to get kids who
are in high school now (who) will want to watch, just because it's
about people their own age,'' Feig says. ``And yet people who have
been out for 20 years could enjoy it, too, because it has that
throwback for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Truth be told, Freaks and Geeks doesn't get much of either
audience, despite being one of the best shows on TV. And although
That '70s Show is a hit, it took a while to pick up a sizable
viewership.
</P>
<P>
   With luck, Freaks and Geeks will, as well. If you've got to
relive the cold chill of visiting the assistant principals office,
there's no better place to do it.
</P>
<P>
   That's the beauty of both shows _ although the details of teen
life change from one generation to the next, turning on the TV on
is still a lot easier than getting turned down for a prom date.
Always has been, always will be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has a different home life,'' Brazill says.
``Everybody has a different family. Everybody has a different job.
But for the most part, high school is universal.''
</P>
<P>
   Bad news if you're still in high school, maybe. Good news for
the rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   Good TV, anyway. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; SINGLE &AMP; SINGLE &LR;  By John le Carre. Pocket Star, $7.99. A master
of Cold War spy fiction finds fresh material in the no less
treacherous world of global finance in this novel about the son of
a British merchant banker who betrays his father to save him from
Russian mobsters. ``It is a rich idea, which le Carre writes
richly,'' Michael Lewis wrote in The New York Times Book Review
last year. He handles his craft ``with his usual spark and
originality.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MORGAN: American Financier &LR;  By Jean Strouse. HarperPerennial,
$18. In this voluminous biography, which was selected by the
editors of The New York Times Book Review as one of the best books
of 1999, the enigmatic J. Pierpont Morgan is portrayed as an
inarticulate man who had little interest in introspection but whose
imperious, ruthless, indefatigable personality enabled him to forge
the financial superstructure of the leading American industries in
the Gilded Age. The author ``debunks many of the errors propagated
by both hagiographers and muckrakers and elucidates in ample detail
Morgan's financial maneuverings'' and personal life, Richard
Lingeman wrote in The New York Times Book Review.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GOING FAST: Poems &LR;  By Frederick Seidel. Farrar, Straus &AMP;
Giroux, $13. These poems _ whether about AIDS, nuclear testing or
the gleaming possibility that is New York _ are filled with echoes
of the last millennium and a nostalgia for a less technocratic
world. ``The poet ranges over the century and picks his targets,
often wisely and with an ironic and acerbic tongue,'' Melanie Rehak
wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In  &UR; HANDWRITING: Poems &LR; , by Michael Ondaatje (Vintage
International, $11), the author of ``The English Patient'' explores
exotic themes drawn largely from the history and mythology of India
and China. Last year, Adam Kirsch admired the collection's ``richly
sensual images'' and ``lush descriptions.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MARILYN MONROE &LR;  By Barbara Leaming. Three Rivers, $15.
According to this biography, the screen icon may have been used and
abused, but she was an intuitive strategist who was fueled by a
furious desire to succeed despite daunting odds. ``The author
restores Marilyn's humanity, gives flesh and blood, intelligence
and initiative, to the archetypal dumb blonde,'' Molly Haskell
wrote in 1998. It is a ``gripping and corrective book.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ON SUNSET BOULEVARD: The Life and Times of Billy Wilder &LR; , by Ed
Sikov (Hyperion, $17.95), chronicles Wilder's turbulent career from
his roots as a gigolo in Germany to one of Hollywood's most
iconoclastic directors (he cast Monroe in ``The Seven Year Itch''
and ``Some Like It Hot''). In 1998 the reviewer Andrew Sarris
called this ``a perceptive and profound appreciation'' of ``the
man, the artist, the showman, the self-promoter ... and the
successful businessman.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TYRANNY ON TRIAL: The Trial of the Major German War Criminals
at the End of World War II at Nuremberg, Germany, 1945-1946 &LR;  By
Whitney R. Harris. Southern Methodist University, $14.95. The
author, who served as a trial counsel during the Nuremberg trials,
has revised and updated his 1954 legal and historical analysis of
the tribunal. ``This is one of those books that are heart-rending
to read and perilous to ignore,'' Saul K. Padover wrote. It is ``a
masterly and meticulous'' work.
</P>
<P>
   In  &UR; THE PARNAS: A Scene From the Holocaust &LR; , by Silvano Arieti
(Paul Dry, $14.95), an Italian psychoanalyst tells of his work with
a tormented leader of the Jewish community in Pisa who was later
murdered by the Nazis. The result is ``a work of art that is in
ennobling contrast to the pain and suffering from which it
sprang,'' Caroline Seebohm wrote in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; KAFKA'S CURSE &LR;  By Achmat Dangor. Vintage International, $12.
This novel employs magical fables to explore the psychic damage
wrought by apartheid that continues to haunt South Africans of all
races. ``Dangor writes lyrical ... prose that switches suddenly
into blazing anger,'' Christopher Hope wrote last year. ``He shows
brilliantly the violent mixture of race, rage and gunfire that
gives South Africa its crazy speed.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EVENSONG &LR;  By Gail Godwin. Ballantine, $14. This novel follows
the marital and spiritual travails of a pastor in a Smoky Mountain
town and her husband, an older priest, as they struggle to balance
the practical and philosophical demands of their faith.
``Meticulousness and precision are ... Godwin's greatest
strengths,'' Claire Messud wrote in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE AMATEUR: An Independent Life of Letters &LR;  By Wendy Lesser.
Vintage, $13. The founder of The Threepenny Review, who describes
herself as an ``18th-century man of letters,'' reveals herself in a
series of essays about a life hopelessly entwined with literature,
dance and theater. The result is a ``deeply humane, modest and
beautifully constructed narration,'' James Shapiro wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE AGE OF TERROR &LR;  By David Plante. St. Martin's Griffin,
$13.95. This novel's hero is a young American expatriate who
struggles to maintain his moral and religious compass when he gets
involved in a messy Oedipal triangle in the chaotic final years of
the Soviet Union. ``Plante leads his readers into some deep, dark
woods,'' Caleb Crain wrote last year.

HIGH SCHOOL MORE FUN WHEN IT'S ON TV 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is there a teenager anywhere who can't wait to get out of high
school? &QL; 
The awkward growth spurts, the uncomfortable social situations, the
raging hormones _ it all adds up to one ugly time.
</P>
<P>
   So why is it so much fun to go back _ on TV?
</P>
<P>
   By which I don't mean a televised visit to a modern high school,
like in Popular or, until the gang went to college this season,
Buffy the Vampire Slayer. High school shows have always been a
television staple, since (and even before) the days of The Many
Loves of Dobie Gillis.
</P>
<P>
   I mean actually going back, back in time, on shows such as
Freaks and Geeks, which returned Monday from a monthlong hiatus,
and That '70s Show. Although the two are markedly different _ That
'70s Show is a straightforward half-hour sitcom set during the Ford
and Carter presidencies, while Freaks and Geeks is a more complex,
hourlong time-machine trip to 1980 _ both rely on their creators'
high-school memories to fuel them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can write a much more honest high school show if I write
about when I was in school,'' says Paul Feig, Freaks creator,
``because I really have no take on what is going on in there today.
. . .
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing we wanted to be is the guys in their 30s
running around going, `OK, what are the kids saying these days?'
and pulling out some term that's already two years out of date and
a band that's over, and we're like, `Oh, we thought they were
cool.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, when kids dance to a Styx song in Freaks, it's funny, not
embarrassing, as it would be if the show took place now and
everyone did the Macarena.
</P>
<P>
   But there is more to this than following the age-old adage of
writing what you know. While we're tossing about adages, how about
throwing ``time heals all wounds'' into the mix?
</P>
<P>
   ``The freshness of the wound has gone away,'' says Mark Brazill,
creator of That '70s Show, laughing. ``The humiliating time has,
God willing, receded from your mind, so you can look at it with a
sense of humor, as opposed to, `It was awful; they looked at me in
the shower.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a certain amount of time to pass before you have the
perspective you need to retell certain parts of your life. I'm 37.
But my perspective is so much better than it was at 18. I feel like
I see (high school days) pretty clearly. It actually makes me happy
to think about. It was a pretty good time.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years after your last wedgie, at least, it seems like it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tragedy plus time equals comedy,'' Feig says. ``It's a bit of
an archaeology, going back and finding the roots of your personal
civilization.''
</P>
<P>
   And the beauty of this science is that, although it's based on
the writers' lives (so much so that Brazill uses his yearbooks for
research), it doesn't demand total accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone who ever stood in the shower after football practice in
ninth grade, paralyzed with angry fear because a couple of
sophomores hit you with soap and dared you to do something about
it, would like the chance to rewrite history. (Purely theoretical
example, mind you.)
</P>
<P>
   These guys get to.
</P>
<P>
   Times have changed as well. Some of the funniest moments in That
'70s Show revolve on the characters _ gasp _ smoking dope.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marijuana was kind of funny at that time,'' Brazill says.
``Cheech and Chong were like the Jim Carrey of that decade. Now?
God, the whole country has a completely different attitude about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, theirs was not just an artistic decision. There are
business concerns to setting the shows in the past, as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``A show about high school 20 years ago is going to get kids who
are in high school now (who) will want to watch, just because it's
about people their own age,'' Feig says. ``And yet people who have
been out for 20 years could enjoy it, too, because it has that
throwback for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Truth be told, Freaks and Geeks doesn't get much of either
audience, despite being one of the best shows on TV. And although
That '70s Show is a hit, it took a while to pick up a sizable
viewership.
</P>
<P>
   With luck, Freaks and Geeks will, as well. If you've got to
relive the cold chill of visiting the assistant principals office,
there's no better place to do it.
</P>
<P>
   That's the beauty of both shows _ although the details of teen
life change from one generation to the next, turning on the TV on
is still a lot easier than getting turned down for a prom date.
Always has been, always will be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has a different home life,'' Brazill says.
``Everybody has a different family. Everybody has a different job.
But for the most part, high school is universal.''
</P>
<P>
   Bad news if you're still in high school, maybe. Good news for
the rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   Good TV, anyway. &QL;

DALLAS BURN DOUSES CHICAGO FIRE IN MLS OPENER
</HEADLINE>

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Plenty of goals, the debut of an international
standout, and a goal and two assists from a player who had no
points until yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for the first game of the 2000 MLS season.
</P>
<P>
   And not bad for the Burn either, who came out the 4-2 winner
yesterday at the Cotton Bowl with another come-from-behind victory
against the Chicago Fire before 12,891.
</P>
<P>
   After twice trailing by one goal, the Burn managed to shake off
a lackluster first half with three goals in the second half to
defeat the Fire, who was knocked out of the playoffs by the Burn
last season in almost exactly the same fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a huge win by the fact that we were behind two times,
and we were able to come back and put them away when we needed
to,'' said Burn midfielder Chad Deering, who had two assists.
``There are some things we still need to iron out, but all in all
I'm pleased with the performance. It was a good way to send Billy
out.''
</P>
<P>
   While the game marked the last for outgoing president and
general manager Billy Hicks, who is leaving the Burn to take a
position with the XFL, it also marked promise for some
up-and-coming players.
</P>
<P>
   The Burn had goals from their usual candidates, forwards Jason
Kreis and Ariel Graziani, but defender Eric Dade notched his first
MLS points in regulation with a goal and an assist. His goal, which
came in the 79th minute, came off a perfectly executed passing
scheme with assists from Kreis and midfielder Oscar Pareja that
threaded right through the Fire defense for a 3-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I'd save them for this year,'' Dade said, referring
to his points. ``\RCoach\S Dave \RDir\S has been letting me get
forward a little bit more. I got a good ball from Oscar and put
together a couple of good passes with Jay, and it happened to work
out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fire had noteworthy performances from its top newcomers,
17-year-old striker DaMarcus Beasley and Bulgarian standout Hristo
Stoitchov, who marked his MLS debut by scoring both of the Fire's
goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first game is always hard,'' Stoitchov said. ``It's sad we
lost. We need better movement within our team, and that will come
with practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Stoitchov's goals gave the Fire (0-1) a 2-1 halftime lead. In
the 28th minute, Deering found Kreis for a header off a free kick
to give the Burn lts first goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Graziani, who played with an Ecuadorian team, Emelec, during the
off-season, didn't miss a beat from his scoring tear last season,
notching the Burn's second goal to tie the game at 2-2 in the 55th
minute.
</P>
<P>
   Graziani found his touch again six minutes after Dade's go-ahead
goal, sending a screaming shot off an assist from Dade into the top
of the net past Chicago rookie goalkeeper Greg Sutton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a fun conversation at halftime and got back to where
the concentration needed to be discipline-wise,'' Dir said.
``That's going to be a challenge this season. We can't live on last
year's season. We've got to keep the focus and step up from where
they were last season.'' nn

SPARTANS FOLLOW THE LEADER, CLEAVES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Double high step. Double fist pump.
</P>
<P>
   Mateen Cleaves was celebrating. A notoriously average jump
shooter, he had reason to act out. His 3-pointer had just given
Michigan State a 64-50 lead. Utah coach Rick Majerus responded by
calling a 20-second timeout. On the way to join the Spartans'
huddle, Cleaves gave an umpire's safe sign indicating that the game
was over.
</P>
<P>
   It was. Thanks to Cleaves' hostile takeover, the top-seeded
Spartans avoided an upset, winning, 73-61, in the second round of
the Midwest Region. Michigan State (28-7) made 61.9 percent of its
second-half shots to foil the efforts of the Utes (23-9).
</P>
<P>
   Utah, playing with a depleted roster, shot 56.5 percent in the
first half to take a 35-32 lead. The Utes made their first four
shots of the second half and led 43-37 with 17:50 remaining. From
there, Cleaves took over.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the first half, they played good D on me, but I sort of
took myself out of the game,'' said Cleaves, who finished with 21
points, and made 4 of 7 3-point attempts. ``I just pushed it in the
second half. I wanted to force the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the next 10 minutes, the Spartans went on a 27-7 run.
Cleaves scored 11 _ hitting two 3-pointers _ and assisted on three
other baskets, including 3-pointers by Morris Peterson and A.J.
Granger.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got in my face after I got a rebound and said, `That's what
I'm talking about,''' Peterson said. ``It was like a demon came out
of him.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Cleaves-inspired spurt, Utah never got closer than
nine points. With 18 seconds remaining and Michigan State dribbling
out the clock, Majerus capitulated and started walking toward the
Spartans' bench to shake hands with coach Tom Izzo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt Cleaves' strength wasn't the outside shot,'' said
Majerus, whose team shot 52.2 percent. ``We tried to make Cleaves
score, and he proved it to us. We picked our poison.''
</P>
<P>
   Majerus said before the game that the game wouldn't be about
wrinkles (tricky strategy) but about personnel. Michigan State's
edge in the personnel file was Cleaves.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it was winning time, he took over,'' Izzo said. ``He's
done it year in, year out, game in, game out.'' \Ntagtop:Wendell

WISCONSIN PLANTS TOP-SEED ARIZONA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ Wisconsin is frequently regarded as a plodding,
defensive-minded, middle-of-the-road program in the Big Ten;
Arizona is one of college basketball's elite.
</P>
<P>
   But perceptions don't win games in the NCAA Tournament. And
yesterday the eighth-seeded Badgers pulled the NCAA Tournament's
biggest stunner to date by knocking out the West Region's No. 1
seed, 66-59.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure I could adequately describe how good we feel, or
how proud I am of this team,'' Wisconsin coach Dick Bennett said.
``They carried out our game plan as close as is humanly possible.
To defend a great team like Arizona is something I'll remember for
a long, long time.''
</P>
<P>
   In being held to a season-low point total, Arizona made only 20
of 51 shots, a percentage of .392 as opposed to Wisconsin's 57
percent second half and a game percentage of .489. The Wildcats'
inside trio of Luke Walton, Justin Wessel and Michael Wright
combined for only nine points as Arizona obviously missed the
presence of injured center Loren Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Wildcats coach Lute Olson alluded to the youth of his team _ he
started three freshmen and two sophomores _ as a factor in the loss
to the more experienced Badgers, making their second consecutive
NCAA appearance after finishing sixth in the Big Ten.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an indescribable feeling,'' said Badgers forward Andy
Kowske, who scored 12 points and pulled in 10 rebounds. ``It's the
best feeling in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Center Mark Vershaw led four Badgers scoring in double figures
with 15 points. Forwards Maurice Litton and Kowske combined for 27.
All are juniors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very obvious they were the better team,'' Olson said.
``One, from the standpoint of maturity and toughness. I told our
team afterward that it's a difficult lesson to learn, but it was
very obvious that Wisconsin's maturity and toughness is something
that every one of our freshmen and sophomores have to be aware of
if we're to get where we want to get as a team.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They did an unbelievable job inside with their big guys. Their
defense made it very difficult for us. They did a great job using
their strength and size inside. We had a number of opportunities
that we were not able to take advantage of and when that happens,
you look at the other team's defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to scramble when we got down, but there's no question
the better team won the basketball game.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona led only once, after a game-opening jumper by guard
Gilbert Arenas, who led the Wildcats with 21 points. Wisconsin led
28-23 at the half and stretched that to 50-33 with eight minutes to
play. Arenas hit a 3-point shot to cut the margin to 64-59 with 17
seconds left, but Wisconsin held.
</P>
<P>
   The Badgers won the NCAA title in 1941, but are making their
first appearance in the Sweet 16 in the modern era.

STARS LET LEAD GO TO WASTE IN LOSS TO BLACKHAWKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Stars winger Brett Hull, his father, Bobby, and Guy
Carbonneau went to grab some lunch Friday.
</P>
<P>
   And dad dispensed some fatherly advice to his struggling son.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him to get himself in shape physically and mentally.
The playoffs are coming up and people are counting on you,'' Bobby
Hull said. ``He just needs to get his confidence back. He'll be OK.
You'll see.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, father does actually know best, because Brett Hull looked
OK and then some against Chicago yesterday, scoring what would've
and probably should've been the game-winner had the Stars not
coughed up a two-goal lead in the third period.
</P>
<P>
   But they did, and the 2-2 tie with the Blackhawks they left town
with is the result.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are not going to win too many games getting two goals,''
Brett Hull said. ``That's usually the problem. It's par for the
course.''
</P>
<P>
   If it's any consolation for Hull, the Blackhawks spoiled goalie
Ed Belfour's comeback as well.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour hadn't played since being charged with misdemeanor
assault and resisting arrest on March 8. He missed five games.
Except for a couple of early-game jitters, though, Belfour said he
felt fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Solid,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock called him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He only missed, what, two games, less than a week?'' Brett
Hull said. ``It's not like he's coming back from a broken leg or
something.''
</P>
<P>
   The ironic thing is, Belfour said he felt his rhythm returning
in the third period, which is when the Blackhawks scored twice.
</P>
<P>
   Both goals came during a 90-second span of four-on-four in the
third period.
</P>
<P>
   With Blackhawks winger Michal Grosek and Stars defenseman Darryl
Sydor both in the penalty box, Chicago came alive. First, Hawks
center Michael Nylander scored at 11:32. Then, defenseman Boris
Mironov scored 72 seconds later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those kind of chances happen in four-on-four,'' Belfour said.
``Of course, it would've been nice to make those saves, but I
didn't. The nice part is I felt more comfortable as the game went
on. I started seeing the puck and feeling it better.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a good thing he did, too. The Blackhawks outshot the Stars
11-6 in the third period and 3-2 in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   So, were the Stars maybe sitting on the lead?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if we so much sat on it,'' Stars winger Kirk
Muller said. ``We just didn't have that killer instinct. We have to
get a little bit more of that killer instinct to get that third
goal.''
</P>
<P>
   With how easily the first two came, the Stars had to figure the
third one wouldn't be too far away.
</P>
<P>
   When Stars winger Mike Keane scored on a rebound of an Aaron
Gavey shot, almost 55 minutes remained in the game. And his goal
was only 28 seconds after Hull's.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Hull scored 4 minutes, 43 seconds into the first period, a
pretty wrist shot from the point that Blackhawks goalie Jocelyn
Thibault didn't see until it was past him. The goal was Hull's 21st
of the season and 607th of his career. He's only three away from
tying his father for eighth on the all-time list.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, right away quick, when he scored first, I said,
`God, he's got the whole game to get three more. He could do it
right here,''' Bobby Hull said. ``I wanted him to do it. I can't
wait until he passes me. In my opinion, he's the greatest goal
scorer ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Brett Hull, for his part, wanted no part of the tying-dad talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no, no,'' he said when asked about it. ``I'm not going to
talk about it. It's stupid. Right now, it is because I haven't done
it yet.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Brett, you're only a hat trick away.
</P>
<P>
   ``That could happen before next Christmas at the pace I'm
going,'' Hull said.

SYRACUSE GETS THE SHOT, SENIORS WHEN NEEDED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Good shooters operate in a blissful, empty-headed
state. No matter how many shots chip paint, it's ``the next one''
that's going in.
</P>
<P>
   Syracuse moves on to the Sweet 16 because sophomore Preston
Shumpert is a good shooter.
</P>
<P>
   Shumpert's 18-foot jumper from in front of his team's bench with
36 seconds left gave the fourth-seeded Orangemen a 52-50 victory
against fifth-seeded Kentucky (23-10) in yesterday's second round
of the Midwest Region. Syracuse (26-5) will meet top-seeded
Michigan State, a 73-61 winner against Utah, in the Midwest
semifinals Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get shots like that, first thing you do is tense
up,'' said Shumpert, a 6-foot-6 guard who wears knee-high black
socks for a distinctive look. ``You don't worry about the past, you
just shoot.''
</P>
<P>
   Shumpert's recent past said this: Don't shoot. He had missed 10
of 13 shots before making his game-winning jumper.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you had made a couple earlier, you wouldn't have needed to
make that one,'' Syracuse coach Jim Boeheim said.
</P>
<P>
   No need to single out Shumpert, Coach. Both teams settled into
zone defenses that strangled the opposition's shooters. The
Wildcats shot 40.4 percent, the Orangemen shot 31.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Syracuse's saving grace was its senior leadership.
</P>
<P>
   When senior center Etan Thomas fouled out with 3:46 remaining,
the Orangemen had a 48-45 lead. During a brief huddle, senior point
guard Jason Hart took the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jason yelled at me and said, `Don't worry about it, we're
going to win,'' Thomas said. ``He said he wasn't going to let us
lose.''
</P>
<P>
   After Kentucky tied it at 48-all on a Jules Camara dunk, senior
forward Ryan Blackwell scored over Kentucky center Jamaal Magloire.
And after another Camara dunk tied it at 50-50, Hart made
game-turning plays at each end.
</P>
<P>
   First, he forced a jump ball (alternate possession: Syracuse)
against Kentucky junior point guard Saul Smith with 51.2 seconds
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw it coming, I knew he was going to drive,'' said Hart,
who missed eight of 10 shots. ``The refs were calling it tight, but
I tried to get as much of the ball as I could.''
</P>
<P>
   On the following possession, Hart drove the left side of the
lane. Instead of trying to shoot over the 6-10 Magloire or the 6-11
Camara, Hart bounced a pass to Shumpert. His shot eluded the
lunging block attempt of Kentucky's Tayshaun Prince.
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky had two shots to tie. Freshman Keith Bogans drove
through the lane and launched a 10-footer that was short. Prince
flashed in for the rebound, but his follow to beat the buzzer
bounced long.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got it, I didn't know how much time there was, so I was
trying to get it to the rim,'' said Prince, who scored 10
consecutive points to give the Wildcats a second-half boost. ``But
I was off balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Syracuse had a 40-23 rebound edge; 21 of those boards were on
the offensive glass and resulted in 22 significant second-chance
points.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won this game because we got on the backboards,'' Boeheim
said. ``It was a game where neither team could get anything going
on offense. It was just a matter of will and determination.''

THIS TRADE COULD HAUNT DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MESA, Ariz. _ Considering the reputations Ismael Valdes and Eric
Young left behind in Los Angeles, it's a wonder the stars of the
latest controversial Dodgers trade are up to the manual task of
putting on their new Chicago Cubs uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   Young is the second baseman with the stone hands, murder on a
fielding percentage, symbolic of a rigid personality. Valdes is the
pitcher with the tender hands, prone to blisters, emblematic of a
delicate psyche.
</P>
<P>
   You picture one of them fumbling his socks, bobbling his cap,
leaving a trail of laundry across the Cubs clubhouse floor. You
imagine the other bloodying a knuckle on his belt buckle.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there they were in the HoHoKam Park clubhouse as a Cactus
League night game wound down, neatly decked out in Cubs blue, red
and white, looking quite comfortable, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy to be where I'm wanted,'' Young said in his corner
of the dressing room, across the way from Sammy Sosa. ``The
situation pretty much got ... cloudy ... over there in L.A. It was
good to come to a little more sunshine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dodgers are the past,'' Valdes said at his cubicle, closer
to the center of the room, directly across from Kerry Wood. ``My
present and future are the Cubs.''
</P>
<P>
   Valdes was on his honeymoon (big on ``privacy,'' he won't say
where) when he heard on television Dec. 12 that he and Young had
been sent to the Cubs in exchange for workhorse pitcher Terry
Adams, Double-A pitcher Chad Ricketts and a player to be announced,
Single-A pitcher Brian Stephenson.
</P>
<P>
   Young was at home in Tennessee when he got a phone call from Don
Baylor, his manager when both were Colorado Rockies and his new
Cubs manager.
</P>
<P>
   Young's reaction was shared by most of us in Los Angeles: ``It
was a steal for the Cubs.''
</P>
<P>
   This might have been the (begin ital)most(end ital)
controversial trade in recent Dodgers history. The Mike Piazza deal
is beyond debatable by now. It's agreed that was a bad move.
</P>
<P>
   This move, it could be argued, was necessary, as one-sided as it
looks.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers were intent on trimming last year's $83 million
player payroll, Young and Valdes were due to receive more than $10
million combined in 2000, and Valdes will be eligible for free
agency next winter.
</P>
<P>
   Young was out of favor with Dodgers manager Davey Johnson, a
permanent wall having gone up between them when Young was benched
in July after failing to turn what Johnson considered a
``room-service'' double play.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes had been out of favor with most of the clubhouse for most
of his six seasons with the Dodgers, a right-hander with Orel
Hershiser's talent but none of the Bulldog's intangibles. Pitching
coach Claude Osteen questioned Valdes' toughness in September,
saying he submitted too easily to the ``negatives'' in his head,
giving public voice to the private complaint.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care what people say. They can talk all they want,''
Valdes said unemotionally the other night. ``How much proof do they
need? I'm a 200-inning (a season) pitcher. What do they want?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had success in the past,'' he adds. ``I have to continue
that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is the case against the trade.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes was a double-digit winner four times as a Dodger, and his
career ERA of 3.38 ranks 10th among active major-leaguers. He left
a hole in the Dodgers' rotation. Young's 51 stolen bases are 13
more than the rest of the Cubs' spring roster combined had in 1999.
He left the Dodgers without an experienced second baseman or
leadoff hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes chooses his words carefully and expresses no bitterness
toward the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have great memories with the Dodgers. I appreciate all they
did for me,'' he said. ``I have nothing against them. I wish the
best of luck for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Does Valdes look forward to pitching against them?
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's my turn, yes. If not, well, nothing I can do,'' he
said. ``They're just another team now.''
</P>
<P>
   But for the rest of us, Dodgers-Cubs will be a matchup to
anticipate.
</P>
<P>
   In the two full seasons Young and Valdes were both in Los
Angeles, the Dodgers won 160 games, three more than the Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   Young and Valdes were a couple of the Dodgers' most notable
recent failures. How they fare in 2000, and how their old and new
teams compare, will help to determine whether the failure was
theirs or the Dodgers'.
