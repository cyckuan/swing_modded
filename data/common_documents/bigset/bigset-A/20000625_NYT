SHAW PROBLEM OUT OF THE BLUE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ As spring training ended, the Los Angeles Dodgers
had concerns about their bullpen, but not their closer.
</P>
<P>
   Acquiring situational lefty, yes. Finding innings for the middle
relievers, yes. Jeff Shaw? Certainly not.
</P>
<P>
   But now the Dodgers are facing the very real issue of what to do
with Shaw. And everything, except trotting him out there to close
games, seems to be an option.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to relive something over and over and over
again,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said. ``It's a problem right
now, and we have to figure out a solution. That's all. We'll have
to figure out a plan to see what to do with him.''
</P>
<P>
   The situation wasn't ideal when Shaw had to wait through two
rain delays Friday before allowing a three-run homer to St. Louis'
Craig Paquette in the 12th inning. That cost the Dodgers the win,
but it's not why the Dodgers are examining the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw has blown seven of 19 save chances and confidence, from all
sides, is waning. His confidence, Shaw said, was ``rocked a little,
shaken, but not broken.''
</P>
<P>
   In order for Shaw to get right, he needs to pitch, and the
Dodgers might not be willing to put him in pressure situations.
</P>
<P>
   However, he's making $5 million this season and is guaranteed $6
million next season, so the Dodgers need to get something out of
him.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are looking for viable options. Mike Fetters has the
experience, but there's a question of whether his right arm can
handle the daily stress of pitching four times a week. Antonio
Osuna might be the one, but he's caved on that role before; Matt
Herges has the make-up, including an arm that recovers quickly and
the requisite fastball, but he's a 30-year-old rookie.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers thought they had the problem worked out when Shaw
took a week off at the beginning of June, but after four strong
outings he's had problems in the past two.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he's right, he's able to locate the ball with the
movement he wants on it, and do that consistently,'' Johnson said.
``When he tries to muscle it to get some movement on it, he doesn't
locate. When you're muscling it, (the slider) is flat.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking for No. 1: F.P. Santangelo started in center field and
batted leadoff for the first time since Todd Hollandsworth returned
from a hamstring injury June 15. Hollandsworth hasn't produced the
way the Dodgers hoped he would.
</P>
<P>
   Hollandsworth is 10 for 36 (.288), but he's walked just once and
his on-base percentage is .297. In addition, Hollandsworth, given a
chance to play regularly since Devon White's injury May 2, is
hitting .249 with five homers and 12 RBI. His on-base percentage is
a dismal .306, and he's batting .143 (6 for 42) with runners in
scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you use a Hollandsworth, maybe you sacrifice a little
on-base percentage but you're going to get more run production,''
Johnson said. ``Well, he's kind of been in a funk with the
run-producing. He hasn't swung the bat with runners in scoring
position, he's actually swinging it worse.''

ANGELS IN DESPERATE NEED OF SHORTSTOP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Justin Baughman's arrival in the clubhouse on
Saturday nearly 19 months after a gruesome broken leg threatened to
end his career may serve as an inspiration to his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   It also serves as a example of how desperate the Anaheim Angels'
search for a shortstop has become.
</P>
<P>
   Baughman is the latest to be given an opportunity to fill the
hole that was created six weeks ago when Gary DiSarcina was lost
for the season after shoulder surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Benji Gil and Kevin Stocker, who was placed on the disabled list
Friday with tendinitis in his left knee, have been given a shot at
the job, but are batting .205 and .184, respectively. Keith Luuloa
was also given a brief audition.
</P>
<P>
   Baughman, who was batting .245 with a team-leading 16 stolen
bases at triple-A Edmonton, will split time with Gil, Manager Mike
Scioscia said. He also gives the Angels an option in the No. 2 spot
in the batting order, a need since Adam Kennedy was dropped to the
No. 8 spot earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia said that based on club reports, Baughman has made
remarkable progress since spring training, when he was shunted off
to the minor league camp after one day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Justin was so far removed from competition,'' Scioscia said.
``It took him a lot longer than any of thought it would to regain
his form.''
</P>
<P>
   Baughman shattered his leg when he collided with an outfielder
on a pop fly during a game in the Mexican League on Nov. 7, 1998.
``I can't even think about it,'' Scioscia said of the injury.
``It's a remarkable story.''
</P>
<P>
   Baughman, who batted .255 in 63 games with the Angels in 1998
and appeared to be their second baseman of the future, said his
return to big leagues isn't any more meaningful than the first time
he was called up.
</P>
<P>
   Other than aches and pains, his leg is fine. It was the mental
part of the game that was difficult to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I had to be perfect,'' he said of spring training.
``I know they didn't have a lot of time to look at people, so I put
a lot of pressure on myself. I felt when I paid my dues, I'd be
back. I knew if they felt I was ready, I'd get an opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickson out of equation: Jason Dickson won't be part of the
Angels pitching equation for some time after his decision,
announced Friday night, to undergo arthroscopic shoulder surgery
next week. It's the second surgery in on his right shoulder in 15
months.
</P>
<P>
   Dickson, 2-2 with a 6.11 ERA, missed all of last season after
surgery to repair a torn labrum. Tuesday's surgery will determine
the severity of what the team is calling a frayed labrum.
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia said he's convinced that Dickson was healthy at the
start of the year because he was one of the team's best pitchers in
April. When Dickson returns, he may have to reconsider his
mechanics.
</P>
<P>
   ``His mechanics aren't ideal, but they're not far off,''
Scioscia said. ``He may have to make adjustments in the way he
delivers the ball to take some pressure off his shoulder.''

D-BACKS HOPING TO CLOSE LEDGERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
(PHOENIX) - The Diamondbacks want to shut the only door - albeit, a
back entrance - through which the public can access detailed
information about the team's finances.
</P>
<P>
   Team executives said the Diamondbacks want an exemption from a
contract that requires the privately held Diamondbacks to give the
public a peek at the team's bottom line, debt, cash flow and even
Managing Partner Jerry Colangelo's seven-figure fee.
</P>
<P>
   `We feel we're a private company, and we'd like to keep it that
way,` President Rich Dozer said.
</P>
<P>
   The financial disclosure contract was intended for the benefit
of bond investors, who helped the Diamondbacks gain more favorable
terms on the repayment of the team's portion of Bank One Ballpark
construction debt.
</P>
<P>
   It requires the team to file financial statements with national
repositories.
</P>
<P>
   But it's also given the public a chance to see how the
Diamondbacks have struggled financially while building a team that
went from worst to first faster than any other in baseball history.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, when the Diamondbacks rose from the cellar to clinch
the National League West title, the team lost $15.8 million from
operations, compared with an operating profit of $21.1 million a
year earlier, according to the team's unaudited financial
statement.
</P>
<P>
   The team blamed the poor financial performance on the doubling
of player salaries - to $69 million, the ninth-highest in baseball,
combined with stagnating ticket revenues that have continued into
2000.
</P>
<P>
   As of Friday, June 23, with the Diamondbacks holding a one-game
lead in the NL West, home attendance for the season was down 2
percent from a year earlier to an average of 35,723 per game, the
team said.
</P>
<P>
   The financial disclosure con tract was signed in 1998 when the
team used $126.9 million worth of taxable Phoenix Industrial
Development Authority bonds to refinance its portion of Bank One
Ballpark construction debt .
</P>
<P>
   Taxpayers contributed $238 million toward the $355 million
stadium, where the Diamondbacks have a 30-year lease, and the team
put up the rest.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the lease and operating agreements, the team pays the
Maricopa County Stadium District, which owns and operates the
facility, a variety of fees that totaled $2.4 million in 1999,
according to district records.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the public-private partnership that built BOB, the team
is not required to file financial information with the stadium
district.
</P>
<P>
   `Our contracts have very difficult escape clauses that make it
prohibitive for the team not to pay, not to produce, to try to
leave,` said Bill Scalzo, stadium district director. `We are
protected very well,` without having to ask for full financial
disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Harris, the team's vice president of finance, said the team
is exploring ways in which it can distribute financial information
directly to bondholders instead of through a public repository, as
the contract with bond underwriters now requires.
</P>
<P>
   The bonds are backed by an insurance policy, for which the
Diamondbacks paid a premium, that would cover the bond principal
and interest if the Diamondbacks were not able to make the
payments. That insurance policy also protects the Industrial
Development Authority if the Diamondbacks defaulted, said Bryant
Barber, the authority's bond attorney.
</P>
<P>
   `It's not that we don't care about the Diamondbacks' financial
performance,` Barber said. `It's just that at the end of the day,
the (insurance company) is right there.`
</P>
<P>
   Bondholders - in this case, institutions that can afford to buy
paper that originally sold in $100,000 denominations - are the only
parties that can seek compliance of the financial disclosure
agreement, according to the contract.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Life Insurance Co. of Newport Beach, Calif., which holds
$10 million worth of the bonds, said through a spokeswoman that it
has not been contacted by the Diamondbacks or Bank One, which is
trustee for the bondholders, about a possible exception to the
contract.
</P>
<P>
   `In general, if there is an insurance policy backing (the
bonds), the insurer takes first responsibility for repayment,` said
Pacific Life's Milda Goodman.
</P>
<P>
   That makes financial disclosure by the bond issuer less
critical, she added.
</P>
<P>
   Dozer said he does not expect the team to show an operating
profit in 2000. But he downplayed any potential need for another
infusion from limited partners.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, while in the midst of a cash crunch, the Diamondbacks
called on the team's 29 limited partners, including Phoenix
Newspapers Inc., the parent company of The Arizona Republic, to
kick in an additional $1 million each. Twenty-four investors
complied, including The Republic's parent company.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second cash call made on limited partners since the
team began play in 1998. &QL;

DODGERS END UP ALL WET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Los Angeles Dodgers manager Davey Johnson sat in his
office chair, shirt unbuttoned and speaking softly. Players slowly
filtered through an energy-less clubhouse, kicked back in chairs
with heavy eyes and tired minds and bodies.
</P>
<P>
   The scene was all that was needed to understand how the Dodgers
felt after sitting through three rain delays that turned a
high-noon baseball game into one that really didn't get going until
twilight.
</P>
<P>
   That the Dodgers lost 6-1 to St. Louis at Busch Stadium on
Saturday was a small part of it. That three rain delays lasted four
hours, 55 minutes on an afternoon that concluded seven hours, 47
minutes after the scheduled first pitch told the rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the adrenaline starts going, you have to shut it down,''
said Dodgers left fielder Gary Sheffield, who's hitting streak
ended at 13 games. ``We had three different times we were going to
start, you get ready to go and they say it's raining again, so you
go back and relax and get your mind off of what's going on. Then,
they say you're going again. That hot-cold stuff, it's hard to get
loose.''
</P>
<P>
   In less than 24 hours in St. Louis, the Dodgers saw more rain
and rain delays than they'll see in a decade in Los Angeles. In
total, the first two games of the series produced five rain delays
lasting five hours, 36 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   But the more painful number for the Dodgers is two - as in
losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a grueling day, and the guys were a little bit worn
down,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said. ``We grinded hard.
We're still grinding, but the tank is a little dry. ... It happens
all the time where you sit around and you play. It was just a
little tougher since it was a long game (Friday) night and you get
up early in the morning for a (12:25 p.m.) game.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the rain also complicated the pitching arrangements,
which probably will see Orel Hershiser start Monday, his second in
three days.
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser (1-4) started against the Cardinals, but that was
after two rain delays. The start of the game was delayed one hour,
6 minutes, and then 33 more minutes after the top of the first.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first one, we really missed our window,'' Hershiser said.
``That radar really screwed us up, I guess. If we had just battled
through that first little downpour, about three minutes or five
minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser allowed a 483-foot, two-run homer to Mark McGwire -
the 550th of his career - in the first inning to give the Cardinals
a 2-0 lead. But when the rain came after Eduardo Perez's one-out
double in the second (at 2:31 p.m.), Hershiser didn't return.
</P>
<P>
   The game began three hours, 16 minutes later, thanks to a
colossal gaffe from the grounds crew in taking 14 minutes to get
the tarp on, which included Cardinals manager Tony La Russa lending
a hand. They mismanaged putting the tarp on the field, and the
infield was drenched. They spent nearly two hours redoing the
entire infield in the glow of the sun before the game could
restart.
</P>
<P>
   When it finally began again, Monday's scheduled starter, Carlos
Perez, was on the mound. And he possibly proved that maybe he could
pitch out of the bullpen, throwing 4 innings and allowing one run
on two hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a guy who doesn't play every day, and I felt like my bat
was 100 pounds, so I can imagine what the other guys were
feeling,'' Dodgers catcher Paul LoDuca said. ``It's one of those
things, but Carlos came out and he threw awesome. He threw great.''

WILLIAMS ON BUMPY ROAD TO PASSENGER SERVICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY BETTY BEARD  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
(PHOENIX) - Mesa's Williams Gateway Airport, where thousands of Air
Force pilots earned their wings, is now facing its ultimate test:
shedding the last of its drab military fatigues to become a modern
passenger airport.
</P>
<P>
   An old squadron building is about to be remodeled into a
four-gate passenger terminal, and the weed-strewn road in front of
it is about to be paved and widened, the final steps to opening the
airport to passenger service by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   But Williams' ambitious plan to become an East Phoenix Valley
passenger alternative to Phoenix's Sky Harbor International Airport
has run into some serious turbulence.
</P>
<P>
   Although airport officials have been talking to airlines for
several years, none has signed up so far, not even little charter
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Airport Director Lynn Kusy says that's because efforts to lure
lucrative passenger service just began in earnest this month and
airlines have been waiting to make sure the terminal became
reality.
</P>
<P>
   `They said, `When you have a firm schedule for a terminal, we'll
start discussions,` Kusy said. `We're hoping to have some charter
planes for the Fiesta Bowl.`
</P>
<P>
   Luring passenger service may not be easy, said Mike Boyd, an
airport and airline consultant in Evergreen, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   He said that it took two years for MidAmerica Airport, created
from part of Scott Air Force Base near St. Louis, to attract
passenger service. &QL; 
NOT MANY CONVERSIONS
</P>
<P>
   Boyd said there haven't been many conversions from former Air
Force bases to commercial airports.
</P>
<P>
   `You've got to be careful with these things,` he said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, an Air Force base from 1941 to 1993 and nicknamed
Willie by soldiers who spent time there, trained about a fourth of
the Air Force's pilots in the late 1970s and 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   It was in such bad shape that it has taken six years to get it
ready for passenger service. Runways had to be rebuilt or repaired,
the control tower had to be modernized, and lead paint had to be
removed from a hangar, among other things. The Federal Aviation
Administration just certified it last year.
</P>
<P>
   Williams Gateway Airport is already one of the busiest in the
state, recording 236,000 takeoffs and landings last year, about a
third of what Sky Harbor had. It's used for everything from private
planes to corporate jets to cargo transports and military training.
</P>
<P>
   But to become a reliever to Sky Harbor in a decade or two and to
make enough money to pay back its investors - Mesa, Gilbert, the
Gila River Indian Community and Queen Creek - the airport badly
needs passenger service.
</P>
<P>
   About $33 million has already been spent on the airport, with
much of it coming from federal and state grants, as well as the
owners: Mesa, which owns 78 percent; Gilbert and the Gila River
Indian Community, with 10 percent each, and Queen Creek, with 2
percent. Together, they're contributing about $4.5 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   An analysis by Williams' officials says the airport could rake
in about $185 million a year with full passenger service and a
larger terminal in 2020. But if it continued with general aviation
and no passenger service, revenues would only be about $7.6 million
a year.
</P>
<P>
   Airport officials say the most likely airlines it can attract
now are smaller companies providing quick jaunts to places like
Colorado or Palm Springs or bringing winter visitors to the
southeast Phoenix area, what those in the industry call `origin and
destination` service. Officials with America West and Southwest
Airlines said they're happy with Sky Harbor and not likely to set
up service at Williams. &QL; 
RELIEVER PLAN QUESTIONED &QL; 
Boyd questions the long-standing plans to make Williams a reliever
airport to Sky Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   `That's the kind of stuff consultants dream up to get a big
invoice,` he said.
</P>
<P>
   But David Krietor, aviation director with Sky Harbor, is
optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   `Sky Harbor and Phoenix have always been supportive of Williams
doing commuter service,` Krietor said. `Since it's in a population
center of about 700,000, we think there may be an opportunity for
established airlines and more likely for entrepreneurial service
companies for folks in the East Phoenix Valley.
</P>
<P>
   `We have not heard of any established carrier that wants to
provide service out of Williams, but the world is an extremely
dynamic and complicated place that changes every day,` he added.
</P>
<P>
   Marie Frank, the new marketing director at Williams, said the
airport has several things going for it.
</P>
<P>
   First, it's near several major employers, notably Motorola and
Intel.
</P>
<P>
   `What airlines want the most are business travelers, which we
are rich in,` Frank said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, it's close to thousands of air travelers, including the
Valley's thickest concentration of winter visitors.
</P>
<P>
   `We think 25 to 27 percent of Sky Harbor customers live closer
to Williams than Sky Harbor,` Kusy said. &QL; 
EASY FOR EAST VALLEY
</P>
<P>
   East Valley fliers would be thrilled, several travel agents
said.
</P>
<P>
   `It's such a horrible rat race to get from here (Chandler) to
there (Sky Harbor) in the morning, especially in the morning when
you're catching an early flight,` said Jeff Kollman, owner of All
Around Travel in Chandler. Going to Williams, he added, `would be a
piece of cake.`

   After seven years, parts of the old base have been rebuilt and
landscaped, but other parts remain dumpy. Some unusable splintery
old buildings remain. A large part of the old housing area is
vacant, surrounded by green tumbleweeds. Weeds are taking over
narrow roads.

(PHOENIX) - For years, US West has dug up streets and Cox
Communications has rebuilt green metal boxes in neighborhoods to
enable systems of copper and cables to deliver high-speed Internet
connections to Phoenix area homes.
</P>
<P>
   Now, antennas the shape of a pizza box springing up on Phoenix
area roofs signal that a third communications heavyweight has
entered the broadband Internet fray.
</P>
<P>
   The entrance of Sprint Broadband, available at the moment only
in the Phoenix area, makes it one of the few proving grounds in the
nation where the three leading broadband technologies - cable,
telephone digital subscriber lines and fixed wireless - go head to
head for the residential and small-business market.
</P>
<P>
   The growing demand for broadband comes from a number of sources.
More families are buying computers and logging on to the Internet
from home than ever. A recent Rocky Mountain Poll indicated that
more than half of all Arizona homes have Internet access. And
people who have access to fast connections at work have grown
intolerant of waiting for Web pages to load at home.
</P>
<P>
   Demand is projected to accelerate as entertainment, telephone
service and home networking are enhanced by fast Internet
connections.
</P>
<P>
   Phone and cable companies such as US West and Cox enjoy a huge
head start in the race to bring broadband, generally defined as a
megabit or more per second, to the nation's houses. At a data rate
of a megabit, broadband can carry choppy video, but not
television-quality video.
</P>
<P>
   But Sprint, backing a technology formerly used for one-way
broadcast of subscription wireless television, may prove to be the
dark horse of the broadband race. &QL; 
FLAT VALLEY HELPS &QL; 
Sprint's technology, called fixed-wireless broadband, has some
advantages over its competition, which must extend or retrofit
existing systems of wires or cables that were not designed to
transmit data.
</P>
<P>
   The flat Valley is also well-suited to Sprint's transmission
towers, and the wireless network is easier and cheaper to build
than rivals' networks.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint says those strengths, combined with the radio spectrum it
has licensed in 90 U.S. cities, may allow it to make up ground
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   `We may be the largest broadband provider in the country in
three to five years,` said Robert Hoskins, Sprint Broadband
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   If a proposed merger with MCI WorldCom goes through, the
combined company will own licenses for the airwaves to over 66
percent of U.S. households.
</P>
<P>
   The analogy of a race is an apt description of the competition
among the three technologies because consumers don't have
preferences for one technology over the other. They just want fast
Internet access, said Kathie Hackler, broadband analyst for San
Jose, Calif.-based Dataquest.
</P>
<P>
   The first company to their door at the right price is likely to
get and keep the business, she said. Each of the competing Internet
services is available for about $40 a month, though US West
requires an additional monthly fee for an Internet provider.
Consumers are further discouraged to switch technologies because of
the significant front-end costs of installation and hardware, which
can cost more than $200 each. Front-end costs are comparable for
all three technologies.
</P>
<P>
   None of the three broadband providers in the Phoenix area would
disclose subscriber totals. But it is clear that upgrades to phone
and cable systems have been expensive and slow, leaving many
neighborhoods without access. Sprint calls this unsatiated demand
`broadband envy` and says its wireless service offers a quick
remedy.
</P>
<P>
   With little promotion since its launch last month, Sprint says
its Valley subscriber base has doubled.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint boasts that its hardware costs to bring service to a city
are measured in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, while
competitors' costs are measured in millions.
</P>
<P>
   In the Valley, the company has two transmission towers, one on
South Mountain, the other on Shaw Butte in the north Valley. From
those two towers, it says, it can serve 85 percent of Valley homes
and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The Valley's flat terrain is ideal for Sprint's wireless towers,
which require a clear line of sight from the tower to a home
antenna. The company is unlikely to get 85 percent coverage from
two towers in other cities, said Mike Paxton, broadband analyst for
Cahners In-Stat Group in Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   WAY BEHIND &QL; 
The question, analysts say, is whether the advantages of wireless
are enough to overcome the huge leads that cable and digital
subscriber line phone technologies enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   Paxton said fixed wireless can't catch up, at least not in the
short haul.
</P>
<P>
   `They're way behind,` he said. `It will be 2002 before you see 1
million fixed wireless users. By then, there will be 10 million DSL
users and 7 million cable broadband subscribers.`
</P>
<P>
   However, Dataquest's Hackler hesitates to write off Sprint's
chances.
</P>
<P>
   `The (proposed) Sprint-MCI WorldCom merger makes this even more
interesting,` Hackler wrote in a May report on the industry.
</P>
<P>
   `A combined capability of 60 percent market coverage without the
limitations of wires makes this an even more interesting race.`
</P>
<P>
   Sprint faces other challenges for its national rollout.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the cable and phone companies, Sprint does not have
strong relationships with equipment providers, Paxton said.
Avoiding hardware shortages will be a hurdle.
</P>
<P>
   `The picture for cable and DSL is a lot clearer from the
manufacturing side,` Paxton said.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint will also have to overcome a shortage of skilled
technicians and avoid distractions from the pending merger, Hackler
said. &QL;

TWINS PUT END TO ANGELS' RUN

<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. -- For the first time in nearly two weeks, the
Anaheim Angels took the field Saturday night with a chance to make
up ground on first-place Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   They marked the occasion by allowing someone named Marcus Jensen
to drive in five runs - establishing a career high and doubling his
season total - and the lowly Minnesota Twins to romp to an 11-5
victory before 28,917 at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels, who remain 5 games out of first place and 4 behind
second- place Seattle, failed for the fifth time this season to
extend a winning streak beyond three games.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels led 4-3 and had hit three consecutive homers off
Angels-killer Eric Milton, but after the third inning they went
meekly into the night.
</P>
<P>
   Milton, who no-hit the Angels last September and had a 21-inning
scoreless streak against them, didn't allow an Angel past first
base from the fourth until he completed his work after seven
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Kent Bottenfield, returning after a stint on the
disabled list with tendinitis in his right shoulder, didn't look
sharp for the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   The young Twins, who started six players with less than two
years of big-league experience, were patient with Bottenfield and
were rewarded for their restraint.
</P>
<P>
   Bottenfield walked four - two of whom scored - and the Twins'
big hits against him all went to the opposite field.
</P>
<P>
   Jensen sliced a ground-rule double down the left-field line to
drive in two runs in the second. Former USC star Jacque Jones put
Minnesota ahead for good, 5-4, when he hit a homer down the
left-field line in the fourth, and Corey Koskie hit a 2-0 pitch
from Bottenfield to left center for a solo homer in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Bottenfield left after five innings, having surrendered seven
hits, four walks and six runs.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Holtz pitched himself in and out of trouble in the fifth,
stranding runners at second and third but wasn't so fortunate in
the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   With David Ortiz at second and two out, Angels manager Mike
Scioscia ordered Denny Hocking intentionally walked so the
left-handed Holtz could face the switch-hitting Jensen, who was 0
for 18 batting right-handed this season.
</P>
<P>
   Jensen foiled the strategy by ripping a double to left-center
that scored Ortiz and Hocking and gave the Twins an 8-4 lead. He
drove in his fifth run with a ninth-inning groundout.

DOTTER CRUISES TO VICTORY

<TEXT>
<P>
   IRWINDALE, Calif. _ Winning NASCAR Winston West races has not
been easy this year.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Dotter made it look a bit easier Saturday night. The
39-year-old from Charlotte, N.C., won the pole for the Home Depot
250 at Irwindale Speedway, took the lead for good with 50 laps to
go and won the race going away before a crowd of 6,490 people, the
largest crowd since opening night.
</P>
<P>
   Dotter is the first double winner in the series this year. He
won the last race, at Laguna Seca.
</P>
<P>
   Dotter, running in third place, went side by side with Steve
Portegna and leader John Borneman II on lap 200. Exiting turn 4 on
lap 202, Dotter, who raced in six NWWS races and was the crew chief
for Sammy Potashnick last year, got by both drivers for the lead.
When the yellow flag came out on lap 213 when Borneman hit the turn
3 wall with a flat right-front tire, the cars bunched up, but the
race was essentially over.
</P>
<P>
   On the restart, Dotter pulled away from second-place finisher
Brendan Gaughan - the series points leader - and won the race by
the length of a straight. Rookie Mike Duncan finished in third
place and Kevin Richards was fourth. Irwindale Super Late Model
points leader Greg Voigt - in his NWWS debut - finished fifth.
</P>
<P>
   There were nine caution flags waved. They were primarily for
cars that hit the wall because of flat right-front tires. Only five
of the 26 cars failed to complete the race.
</P>
<P>
   Dotter earned $6,585 for the victory.

   CALGARY, Alberta _ The first round of Satuday's National Hockey
League entry draft had a distinctly Swedish flavor for the Bruins,
who selected 18-year-old defenseman Lars Jonsson with the No. 7
overall pick and exercised their option to take the pick (acquired
from Colorado) at No. 27, grabbing 18-year-old left wing Martin
Samuelsson.
</P>
<P>
   Both are expected to play in Sweden next year and are
realistically a couple of years away from breaking into the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   Jonsson, who was born in Borlange, Sweden, had 38 points in 34
games for his Leksand junior team. He is a good skater with
excellent offensive skills. He was ranked 70th among Europeans in
the Central Scouting midterm report but moved to 11th at the end of
the year. The Bruins, who had been trying to make a deal to move up
in the draft up until 15 minutes before it began, had him rated
even higher and believed him to be the best available player at No.
7.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very offensive-minded on all levels that he has been
playing hockey,'' said Bruins scout Svenake Svensson, who has seen
a lot of both Jonsson and Samuelsson. ``Since he was about 13, he's
picked up a lot of awards every year in the youth program in
Sweden. He's very skillful offensively.''
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, he needs to improve but he's not considered a
liability, only that his offensive skills are more developed than
those in his own end. Next year, Jonsson is expected to play in the
Swedish Elite League for Leksand.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had 38 points in the junior league and that's amazing for a
defenseman,'' said Svensson of Jonsson's season last year.
</P>
<P>
   When asked why Central Scouting had him rated lower, Svensson
smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some guys like blonde girls, some guys like red hair,'' he
said. ``It's a matter of taste maybe.''
</P>
<P>
   Samuelsson was ranked No. 9 among Europeans, up from No. 32 at
midseason, but a serious injury kept him sidelined for much of the
year and is the reason he was taken so late in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was out 3 1/2 months in the middle of the season so it
affected it very much,'' said Samuelsson, who required surgery to
repair a broken bone in his right shoulder. Samuelsson played for
MoDo's junior team last year, scoring 17 points in 19 games, nine
of them goals. He said he has a contract with Hammerby in Stockholm
for next year, which is in a league a step below the Swedish Elite
League. He said he would be assured more playing time than if he
tried to play in the higher league.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a good move because it's pretty tough to (win) a
place on one of the Elite teams because the coaches have (a great
deal) of pressure on them,'' said Samuelsson.
</P>
<P>
   He said he wasn't disappointed at going No. 27 because it's
still the first round even though he knew if he had been healthy,
it likely would've meant being picked earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was ranked top five in the beginning of the season but after
the injury, I sunk very much,'' he said. ``I hoped that I would be
picked in the first round. That was what I dreamed of.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruins assistant general manager Mike O'Connell said the team
elected to use Colorado's pick rather than wait until next year
because Samuelsson was available.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get him there we were extremely happy,'' said O'Connell.
``He played very well in the European Junior (tournament). He's a
highly skilled player, very fast and rugged. He could be the best
skater in the draft.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Jonsson, O'Connell said they liked him because of his
offensive skills and hard shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs some work defensively but he's a smart kid and he's
very competitive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Before they selected at No. 7, there was a lot of discussion at
the club's table. O'Connell said it was sparked by whether to take
Jonsson or another player, likely a forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was another player we really liked as well,'' he said.
``We figured both players could be impact players and we looked at
our depth in the organization and thought we needed (a defenseman)
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the draft, Boston had been hoping to make a deal to move
up in the No. 2-5 range but was unable to. There was also the
option of trading the pick to get immediate help, but O'Connell
said the Bruins decided to stay where they were.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't know if there were any players available (to help
the team next year),'' he said. ``There might have been a couple
but the price was just too high. We felt it would have been a step
back.''

RED SOX TUMBLE INTO THIRD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ This is the difference between first and third place.
</P>
<P>
   When you're in first place, someone is apt to try and stick a
pie in your face, which was what Toronto closer Billy Koch was
attempting to do in a sneak attack on Blue Jays strongman Carlos
Delgado during a postgame TV interview.
</P>
<P>
   When you're in third place, your starting pitcher is sitting in
front of his cubicle, his voice choked with emotion while he tries
to fight back tears; your center fielder is cryptically suggesting
he knows what's wrong with the team but can't say; and your manager
stays behind closed doors for almost a half-hour.
</P>
<P>
   That was the scene in the Red Sox clubhouse after the Sox
tumbled into third place for the first time since May 2 after a 6-4
loss to the Blue Jays in a newly popular SkyDome. A crowd of 30,130
showed up to see the home team make it two in a row over the Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Rose, who is winless in his last six starts and fast
losing his grip on the slim thread holding him in the starting
rotation, was as vulnerable in the clubhouse as he was on the mound
Saturday afternoon. Rose, who gave up a two-run home run to Delgado
in the first and a two-run home run to Alex Gonzalez in the third,
was pulled with two outs in the third after Brad Fullmer reached on
an error by Nomar Garciaparra, the shortstop's third error this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Rose was still shocked after the game that manager Jimy Williams
had come to get him, even though Gonzalez's home run had come right
after the Sox had tied the score at 2 on Garciaparra's home run in
the second and Carl Everett's RBI single in the top of the third.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, I don't have anything to say,'' said Rose. ``Anything
I say will get me in trouble. The situation is very hard. Yeah, I
was surprised (to be lifted). So many things are running through
your head. To go out there and try to compete is very hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose has been working with pitching coach Joe Kerrigan on his
delivery. Asked what things were crowding his mind, he said:
``There are too many to talk about, but I can't pitch this way. Not
in this league. Not at this level.''
</P>
<P>
   There is the possibility Rose will not pitch at this level for
much longer. Williams, when asked about Rose's place in the
rotation, said: ``We still have him scheduled to start in five
days, as we speak today.''
</P>
<P>
   That qualifier, of course, reserves Williams the right to change
his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm fed up,'' he said. ``I've got to do the things that make
me successful. If it takes going back three years to figure it out,
then maybe I've got to go back there,'' he said. ``I'm trying to
figure out what's going to make me better and help us as a team.
It's not fair to the bullpen to have to use them like that when I
pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   In only three of his first 12 starts, Rose has finished six
innings. He has allowed 12 earned runs in his last 9 2/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox offense, meanwhile, continues to run on empty, even with
Jose Offerman back in the leadoff spot after a one-day absence
(sore left knee) and Garciaparra back at short after being limited
to DH duties Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Trot Nixon was out with a strained right hamstring, leaving
Everett flanked by two players (Curtis Pride and Darren Lewis), who
had one home run between them.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto starter Roy Halladay is a young righthander whose
circumstances mirror Rose's. He's a righthander who hadn't lived up
to expectations. Halladay had a 2-4 record and an 11.97 ERA when he
was sent to the Jays' minor league team in Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday was his first test, and after allowing Garciaparra's
home run, and three singles in the third, Halladay held the Sox
hitless until singles by Jeff Frye and Everett opened the eighth.
With reliever Paul Quantrill on the mound, Garciaparra's infield
out and Jason Varitek's RBI single made it 5-4, but Brad Fullmer
gave closer Koch and the Blue Jays a bigger comfort zone with a
home run in the bottom of the eighth off Rheal Cormier.
</P>
<P>
   Everett was asked if it was obvious the Sox are playing short.
``No,'' he said. ``We're playing well. Things don't happen for us.
I'm not going to state why we're not playing well.''
</P>
<P>
   That is no misprint. In the same paragraph, Everett said the
team was and wasn't playing well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys are playing hard, but we're coming up short,'' Everett
said. ``There's a few reasons, but I can't mention them.''
</P>
<P>
   Again, mystery. Was the normally forthcoming Everett afraid he'd
get in trouble if he went public with his take on the team? ``I'm
not worried about myself getting in trouble,'' he said. ``It's just
not something you should know.''
</P>
<P>
   He did admit to one shortcoming he perceives. ``I know we're not
aggressive enough, for this team. We're not.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he thought there may be changes afoot, Everett said:
``Changes? Like what? Why? This team has been our squad. This is a
good team. We can't worry about what the front office might do.''
</P>
<P>
   But when the view is from third place _ the Sox are 1 1/2 games
behind the Blue Jays and a game behind the second-place Yankees _
it's not hard to detect some movement on the horizon.

MILBURY MOVES TO FORE 
</HEADLINE>
 DRAFT-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALGARY, Alberta _ Acting like a man who closes his eyes at
night and sees his name on a pink slip, former Bruin Mike Milbury
took center stage at the NHL entry draft Saturday and attempted to
transform his Islanders from laughingstock to playoff contender.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago considered the man who would lead the Bruins into
the 21st century, Milbury stole the show, pulling off three impact
trades and choosing Boston University netminder Rick DiPietro with
the first overall pick in the draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Goaltending is the most important position in the sport,''
explained Milbury, who, just before selecting DiPietro, dealt away
netminders Kevin Weekes and Roberto Luongo in separate trades. ``We
are hanging a lot of our reputations on this kid (DiPietro).
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be crazy . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   But after missing the playoffs for a mind-numbing six straight
seasons, the Islanders, recently acquired by owners with deep,
cash-lined pockets, went into the two-day kiddie jamboree intent on
shopping their way back into the game.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the bold move to select DiPietro, the Winthrop, Mass.,
wunderkind, Milbury also masterminded these deals:
</P>
<P>
   --Shipped Weekes to the Lightning, along with towering defense
prospect Kristian Kudroc and a second-round pick, for a package of
draft picks that included Tampa's No. 5 overall. Four picks after
plucking DiPietro, the Isles then chose Raffi Torres, a
5-foot-11-inch fireplug left wing who can deal out stinging hits
and score.
</P>
<P>
   --Sent Luongo, once believed the game's brightest goaltending
prospect, and former Los Angeles Kings center Olli Jokinen to
Florida for a pair of young, impressive wings, Oleg Kvasha and Mark
Parrish.
</P>
<P>
   --Acquired elite defenseman Roman Hamrlik, the No. 1 pick in the
'92 draft by Tampa, from Edmonton for promising blue liner Eric
Brewer, forward Josh Green, and a second-round draft choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are not a better team immediately,'' Milbury said days
before the draft, ``and if we are not a playoff team in the very
near future, then it's off with my head.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the day's proceedings paled in comparison to the
actons of Move'em Milbury.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins raised some eyebrows by using both of their picks,
Nos. 7 and 27, to select Swedes, smooth-skating defenseman Lars
Jonsson and forward Martin Samuelsson, respectively. In opting for
Jonsson at No. 7, the Bruins discarded the conventional wisdom of
the league's Central Scouting Bureau, who rated Russians Mikhail
Yakubov and Pavel Vorobiev as the top two European positional
players in the draft. The Blackhawks, choosing 10th and 11th,
scooped up the two promising Russians.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago general manager Mike Smith added some suspense to the
first round, calling a timeout before finally selecting Yakubov at
No. 10. Smith, who lives on Martha's Vineyard, could be seen making
phone calls at the Hawks' draft table, lending an air of a possible
blockbuster deal. He later explained that he attempted to trade the
No. 11 pick, but failed.
</P>
<P>
   The day's other significant deal, by Colorado, had a tangential
tie to the March 6 trade that sent Ray Bourque from the Bruins to
the Avalanche. Confident with their blue line after Bourque
recently signed to come back to Denver for at least one more year,
the Avalanche dealt offensive defenseman Sandis Ozolinsh to the
Carolina Hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
   A Group 2 free agent, Ozolinsh will command at least $4 million
a year with his next deal. It's a safe bet that the Avalanche
worked their way down the order of selection in the first round,
offering the enigmatic Ozolinsh to every NHL club for a
first-rounder, and finally got the Hurricanes to give up the prime
No. 14 pick. Carolina also sent defenseman Nolan Pratt to Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are sad,'' said a humble-looking Pierre Lacroix, the
Colorado GM, during a TV interview moments after the trade was
announced. No doubt, though, the Avalanche were glad to get out
from under Ozolinsh's deal, especially given the fact they owe
Bourque at least $6.5 million for his 2000-01 contract.
</P>
<P>
   The Hurricanes, now with Ozolinsh a key factor at the point on
their power play, also assuredly will allow veteran blue liner Paul
Coffey to leave as an unrestricted free agent. Look for the Maple
Leafs to move quickly and sign Coffey once he becomes a UFA July 1.
</P>
<P>
   From a New England standpoint, it was a mild surprise to see
UMass-Lowell defenseman Ron Hainsey selected before Boston College
blue liner Brooks Orpik. Hainsey was ranked ninth among North
Americans and went 13th overall to the Canadiens. Orpik, ranked
fourth overall in North America, drifted to Pittsburgh at No. 18.
Krys Kolanos, Orpik's teammate at BC, went with the next pick, to
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Milbury made it clear that the Isles plan to plug DiPietro right
into the net this fall. With Weekes and Luongo gone, there are few
other options. The additions of Parrish, Kvasha, and Hamrlik bring
solid NHLers to Uniondale. If DiPietro is the real thing, then one
day of dizzying deals just may save Milbury that trip to the
guillotine.

GOALIE PROVES TOP SHELF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   CALGARY, Alberta _ Rick DiPietro and the New York Islanders made
history Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The 18-year-old former Boston University standout became the
first goaltender taken with the first overall pick in the National
Hockey League draft since it was modified in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   After general manager Mike Milbury traded former goalie of the
future Roberto Luongo as part of a multi-player swap to the Florida
Panthers, the stage was set for DiPietro to go in the top spot. In
a hectic day for Milbury, the Islanders also made a deal with Tampa
Bay for the No. 5 overall pick, with which they took forward Raffi
Torres. But the news of the day was DiPietro.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really shifting assets here,'' said Milbury. ``We have a
different type of goalie in DiPietro. We were really wrenched over
the loss of Luongo, who's a quality kid and a quality goaltender.
He's a class act and a kid we would've been happy to ride with. But
as the draft progressed, it was clear that the value of Luongo was
greater than the value of the first overall pick. In our minds,
DiPietro possesses an element (stickhandling) that Roberto perhaps
doesn't possess. You could make an argument for either one.''
</P>
<P>
   For DiPietro, it was an exciting surprise even though it was
widely believed the Islanders had decided to take him No. 1 if a
deal for Luongo could be reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think all the teams were being kind of secretive about the
whole thing,'' said DiPietro. ``I really didn't know what was going
to happen. I was pleasantly surprised to hear my name called and
I'm just ecstatic right now.''
</P>
<P>
   By dishing goalie Kevin Weekes to Tampa Bay and Luongo to
Florida, DiPietro becomes both New York's goalie of the future and
the goalie of the urgent present.
</P>
<P>
   With the Islanders under new ownership that is committed to
spending, there is pressure to at least make the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, there's going to be a lot of pressure put on me,''
said DiPietro. ``Roberto Luongo was an excellent goaltender. I
enjoy the pressure. I hope I'm ready for the next challenge, and
I'm going to do my best to make it possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The next step is signing him, which appears to be imminent. Paul
Krepelka of Woolf Associates, said he and Milbury talked into the
wee hours Friday night and that they are on the same page. Krepelka
seemed optimistic everything would work out.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1969, when the draft was altered from a format of
territorial picks to an overall amateur draft, teams have been
reluctant to take goaltenders early. Before DiPietro, Luongo was
the goalie taken highest when he was picked at No. 4 by the
Islanders in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Three goalies have been taken with the No. 5 pick _ Tom Barrasso
by Buffalo in 1983, John Davidson by St. Louis in 1973, and Ray
Martyniuk by Montreal in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Two were selected with the No. 6 pick _ Brian Finley (Nashville,
1999) and Michel Larocque (Montreal, 1972). Jamie Storr was picked
at No. 7 in 1994 by the Los Angeles Kings and twice goalies have
been taken at No. 8 _ Grant Fuhr by Edmonton in 1981 and Jimmy
Waite by Chicago in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   DiPietro became just the fourth US-born prospect to be No. 1
overall. The others were Bryan Berard (Ottawa, 1995), Mike Modano
(Minnesota, 1988), and Brian Lawton (Minnesota, 1983).
</P>
<P>
   After choosing Luongo, the Islanders wanted to bring him along
slowly. From what Milbury said Saturday, there seems to be no such
plan for DiPietro, who is as well known for his confidence on the
ice as his deftness with a stick.
</P>
<P>
   When asked what changed his mind about DiPietro jumping into the
league at 18 vs. Luongo, Milbury said it was the player himself who
made him see things differently. ``His attitude,'' said Milbury,
``his approach to the game, his manner.''
</P>
<P>
   DiPietro, from Winthrop, Mass., went from one year of college,
to opting into the draft, to being the No. 1 pick and likely
starting netminder for the Islanders when they open the season in
October. ``It's obviously very mind-boggling,'' said DiPietro.
``This was never something I thought would happen or even expected
to happen. And to have an opportunity to step in and be a big part
of the Islanders is something that I'm really looking forward to
and I'm really going to put a lot of effort into doing.''

PIECE OF CAKE FOR INKSTER 
</HEADLINE>
 CHAMPIONSHIP-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILMINGTON, Del. _ There was a birthday cake covered with
frosting, but for Juli Inkster the really sweet stuff had come in
the form of 18 holes of near-flawless golf that pushed her into
major view once again.
</P>
<P>
   Turning 40, said Inkster, felt great. Shooting a third-round
6-under-par 65 Saturday to get to 7-under 206 and a tie for the
lead at the McDonald's LPGA Championship was pretty good, too. ``I
did what I wanted to do,'' said the defending champion after
burning the back side at DuPont Country Club in 5-under 31, the
exclamation point being a birdie-birdie-birdie finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm there.''
</P>
<P>
   Which probably is no surprise to the field at this second major
of the season. ``We all expect that of Juli,'' said Wendy Ward, who
dropped back into a tie with Inkster when she chopped up the
course's easiest hole, the 465-yard, par-5 16th.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to cut (my drive) around the corner, but got it too
close to the tree limbs,'' said Ward, who had shaken off a bogey at
the par-4 seventh to run off five birdies in her next eight holes
to get to 8 under. The drive came to rest among trees, in thick
rough, ``300-plus yards away,'' and led to her first bogey on a par
5 in 54 holes.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the mishap, Ward can at least claim a share of the lead,
which is more than her playing partner, Laura Davies, can say. The
long-hitting, free-spirited Englishwoman was inexplicably sloppy
over a course she has come to love. A two-time winner of this major
at DuPont, Davies started the day with a two-shot lead over Ward
before crashing with a 75_211 that put her into a tie for seventh
at 2 under.
</P>
<P>
   Davies was the only name on the leaderboard to stumble, as
sub-par rounds ruled the day. Jan Stephenson, at 48 seeking her
first victory since 1987, posted her third straight red number, a
69_208, to move into third place, a shot ahead of Nancy Scranton
(67). Jane Crafter (69) and Michele Redman (70) are tied for fifth
at 3-under 210, while those at 2 under include Davies, the
ever-present Karrie Webb (69), 1998 champion Se Ri Pak (69), Wendy
Doolan (71), and the pride of Westford, Mass., Pat Bradley, who at
age 49 shot 67 and shared low round of the day until Inkster caught
fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of people who are 2 under or 1 under can get hot
and come from behind,'' said Inkster, who pointed the finger at
herself as Exhibit A. ``I got hot on the back side and came from
behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Hotter than the weather, to be honest, because Inkster _ who
started the day tied for ninth at 1 under _ fell from the
leaderboard thanks to a three-putt bogey on the opening hole, then
casually ran off five pars to sit at even for the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I got better as the day went on,'' said Inkster, who won
three majors before turning 30, then went nine years without
another before winning this title and her first US Women's Open in
1999. ``My swing is feeling a little better as the days are going
on.''
</P>
<P>
   She drained a 25-foot birdie putt on the par-4 seventh, then
followed with a 2-footer at the par-3 eighth. After making the turn
in 1-under 34, Inkster jumped from Page 2 to Page 1 of the
leaderboard with birdies at 10 and 11, then made four pars before
her grand finish _ a 2-foot tap-in at the 16th, a 12-footer at the
par-3 17th, and a 35-footer at the 18th in front of balloons and
dozens of well-wishers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there was one person that didn't know it was my
birthday,'' said Inkster, whose lackluster 72-69 start had moved
the focus from her to players such as Davies, Stephenson, and Ward.
</P>
<P>
   Though Davies has a history of bouncing back in this tournament
(she wiped out a three-shot deficit and won here in 1996) and
Stephenson is a sentimental choice, the duty to play head-to-head
with Inkster falls to the unheralded Ward, 27, who is in her fifth
year on Tour and, despite two wins, is still trying to reach
personal goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I set as high expectations for myself as anybody possibly
could,'' said the 1994 US Women's Amateur champion and one-time
All-American at Arizona State. ``I think expectations are good.
They make you work hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Her first real threat to win a major was put in motion _ make
that slow motion because she started with six pars, then made bogey
at the par-4 seventh _ with a string of four birdies, starting at
the 189-yard eighth hole when she drilled a 4-iron to within 18
feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably the most consistent round I've played,'' said Ward,
who followed those four birdies with four straight pars, then her
fifth birdie of the day at the par-4 15th to get to 8 under.
</P>
<P>
   It ushered her to the 16th, which is where she gave back a shot,
but that small hiccup couldn't wipe the smile off her face. ``I
think I've got just as good a shot as anybody else to win,'' said
Ward.
</P>
<P>
   Inkster probably would say the same thing, viewing another LPGA
Championship as a perfect gift to go with the birthday cake.

HALL OF FAMER CARNER HAS STOOD TEST OF TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM McCABE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILMINGTON, Del. _ She concedes most of her competitors ``fly it
by me now,'' that back spasms flare up from time to time, and
playing four weeks in a row _ as she did earlier in the season _
drains her physically.
</P>
<P>
   Then you realize the woman telling you this is 61 years old and
has just birdied the closing hole to shoot 2-over 73 in a major
championship against players who are half her age. ``Up until this
year, I would kind of whip it up there with them,'' said JoAnne
Carner, who played in her 27th LPGA Championship this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Carner followed that 73 with a 76 and missed the cut for the
fourth straight year, but her presence is always a plus for golf;
she serves as a reminder that the game, though dominated these days
by a 24-year-old sensation, owes so many trailblazers who toiled
when the spotlight was not so bright.
</P>
<P>
   Carner's last trip to the winner's circle in an LPGA event took
place nearly 16 years ago, and it's been 24 years since that second
US Women's Open triumph established her as one of the game's
greats. From 1974 to 1983, Carner won her second US Open and put up
these Open finishes: three seconds, two thirds, a fourth, a sixth,
and a 10th. She has not won the LPGA Championship, but she has 12
top 10s, including a second when she was 53.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, all that came after she virtually retired the US
Women's Amateur trophy, winning it five times. There are no regrets
about waiting until 1970, when she was 31, to turn pro because
money wasn't much of a factor in those days and, besides, she was
enjoying life.
</P>
<P>
   Snapshots of those wonderful days would most certainly include
the years she and her husband owned an executive golf course in
Seekonk, Mass. Don Carner was a salesman working in Providence and
he ``always wanted to own a golf course,'' said JoAnne. So he
crossed over the state line into Massachusetts and built a place
they called Firefly.
</P>
<P>
   The name suggests an explanation, and Carner laughs. It was
named by ``a drunken woman,'' who responded to Carner's plea. ``I
said, `I need a name for this place right now because it has to be
in the Yellow Pages in the morning,' '' said Carner. It was a hot
night and her friend slurred something about a firefly and thought
that was a fitting name.
</P>
<P>
   And so it became Firefly, home to some wonderful memories for
the Carners. In 1968, for instance, the day after ``The Great
Gundy'' _ short for Carner's maiden name Gunderson _ won her fifth
US Women's Amateur, she was back serving hot dogs at Firefly.
</P>
<P>
   ``A guy turns and says to a customer, `JoAnne just won the Rhode
Island state championship,' '' said Carner, laughing pleasantly.
``Talk about coming down to reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Carner turned pro and earned a whopping $14,551 in 1970, most of
it coming at something called the Wendell West Open, her first LPGA
Tour win. The first US Women's Open triumph came the next year and
on she went until 43 wins and admittance to the LPGA Hall of Fame
had been earned.
</P>
<P>
   The Carners sold Firefly in 1981, settling in Florida, where
fishing had become a favorite pastime. Most of her life was devoted
to caring for Don, who suffered from Parkinson's disease, and until
his death in January, they were inseparable.
</P>
<P>
   Carner played in nine events last year, but might play 15 this
year. She'll see how she feels, but, yes, she gets a kick out of
trying to keep up with the youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to, in my amateur days, have a nice, slow move through
the ball like she does,'' said Carner. ``When I turned pro, I got
more upright and started getting quicker, which was my downfall.''
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods is dominating the PGA Tour, and Carner wonders if
his competitors, seemingly running scared, could use the advice she
has been offering for years: ``Basically, when you play golf, you
don't watch anyone. I used to tell the rookies, look for four-leaf
clovers, anything to take your mind off of someone else's swing.''
</P>
<P>
   Then her blue eyes come to life and Carner realizes that perhaps
even she wouldn't be able to stick to her words.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if I played with Tiger, I'd have to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After his final round at the US Open, Nick Faldo said his summer
schedule will be light _ the Loch Lomond, the British Open, the PGA
Championship _ because once points become available for next year's
European Ryder Cup team, he plans on playing as many as five events
in six weeks. If he's rediscovered some of his game, Faldo could
make things interesting because he wants Mark James replaced as an
assistant captain . . . Other US Open leftovers: Padraig Harrington
finished in a tie for fifth, but didn't agree with one reporter's
reference to him as a surprise. ``You're saying I'm a surprise, but
I'm plodding along on my own. If I finished fifth this week, that's
OK. I finished fifth before in a major, so it's nothing new. It may
be surprising people, but I'm not too worried.'' . . . Indeed, the
tournament was ``open'' to all candidates, but once it ended,
Jeffrey Wilson, the only amateur to make the cut, was back at work
selling Toyotas . . . Tom Kite plans on being at Southern Hills for
next year's Open (he's got two years left on his 10-year exemption
for winning in 1992), and both Watson and Hale Irwin said they'd
like to be there, even if it means going through sectional
qualifying . . . Vijay Singh, despite being the Masters champ,
didn't attract a lot of pre-tournament support at Pebble Beach and
the reason was simple: Observers were surprised by his decision to
change his putter and putting stroke so shortly after winning a
major. Though he closed with a 68 to finish in a tie for eighth,
Singh said he was ``very, very disappointed.'' . . . For the third
straight year, Paul Azinger finished top 15 to earn an exemption
next year . . . There's a simple recipe for beating Woods, said Lee
Janzen. ``Someone who can drive the ball 300 yards every time,
smart enough to play the right shots into the green, has the
imagination to curve the ball, strong enough to get out of any
rough, and holes every putt in sight.'' . . . Woods played the
tough 8-9-10 stretch in level par for four days. Colin Montgomerie
was 11 over for those holes . . . Bill Glasson recorded a double
eagle in the first round of the FedEx St. Jude Classic in Memphis,
using driver-driver on the 527-yard fifth hole. Not to be outdone,
Peter Mitchell did the same at this weekend's European Tour stop,
holing a 220-yard 4-iron. Then along came Sam Torrance with an ace
at the 174-yard par 3.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Karrie Webb said it would be an honor to meet Mickey Wright,
arguably the greatest player in women's golf history. ``I've been
fortunate enough to get to play with (most of the Hall of Famers),
but meeting Mickey Wright is one thing I have not done.'' . . .
Does Webb, like Woods, aspire to be the game's greatest? ``If I'm
just regarded by my peers as one of the best, that would be as much
as I could ever wish.'' Consider it done . . . Observers pointed
out that while Woods's 15-shot victory in the US Open was
phenomenal, Webb's victory in the Nabisco Championship _ 10 shots _
was not too shabby . . . The US Women's Open will certainly
dominate Webb's view come mid-July, but she isn't looking past a
July 10 charity event at Manhattan Woods CC in New York. It will
benefit the Christopher Reeve Foundation and the cause is dear to
Webb, for her longtime friend and coach in Australia, Kel Haller,
is a quadriplegic. ``Ten years ago, I remember sitting in a spinal
unit talking to my coach, who could not move from the neck down,''
said Webb. ``I spent four or five days in there with him and over
the period of time that he was in the hospital, I just said to
myself that even if Kel was still walking again, if I ever had the
chance to be able to contribute money, or help raise money to find
a cure for paralysis, then that's what I wanted to do.'' . . . Juli
Inkster said that come October, the US will be underdog in the
Solheim Cup in Scotland. That raised eyebrows, given the fact the
US has won four of the five events; but Annika Sorenstam, who most
certainly will anchor the European team, agreed. It will be called
the European team, but Sorenstam figures six Swedes have great
chances to make it . . . Who needs practice? Sorenstam's clubs
didn't arrive with her in France, so the first day she just walked
the course hitting a 7-iron borrowed from Helen Dobson. No problem.
Sorenstam eventually earned her third win of the year.

PAYOFF FOR LAKERS? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It was almost six years ago to the day. The NBA was
getting ready to conduct its annual draft in 1994 and two
powerhouses were in the lottery, on their own, for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Picking ninth, following a 32-50 season in 1993-94, were the
Boston Celtics. Picking 10th, with a 33-49 season, were the Los
Angeles Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   On that June evening, the Lakers and the Celtics were, as was
the case throughout the previous decade, almost identical. This
time, however, they were among the have-nots, rather than the
haves. They had, for the first time in a while, been victimized by
a system they were accustomed to ruling.
</P>
<P>
   That previous year marked the first time in NBA history a player
from neither team participated in the All-Star game. The Celtics
had a playoff run of 14 years come to an end; the Lakers had gone
17 years since they failed to make the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics had had two Hall of Famers retire (Larry Bird and
Kevin McHale) and were about to lose a third, Robert Parish, to
free agency. A fourth player, Reggie Lewis, had died. The Lakers
had lost Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to retirement and Magic Johnson had
contracted HIV. James Worthy had played his final game in an LA
uniform two months earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The draft unfolded in predictable fashion. Glenn Robinson, Jason
Kidd, and Grant Hill went 1-2-3. By the time the Celtics chose,
there was a division in the brain trust: consultant Bird favored
Temple guard Eddie Jones. But the man just recently installed as
the head of basketball operations by owner Paul Gaston saw Parish
leaving and Dee Brown already signed to a six-year deal. M.L. Carr
decided the team did not need another guard; it needed a center.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics chose Eric Montross. The Lakers chose Jones.
</P>
<P>
   The rest, as they say, is history.
</P>
<P>
   The teams have been separating ever since, with the Lakers
rising and the Celtics tumbling and treading water. Los Angeles's
recent title only serves to note how one team with history,
tradition, and grand expectations turned it around while another
team with history, tradition, and grand expectations is still stuck
in a rut.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics tried to rebuild through the draft, going so far as
to tank a whole season (1996-97) in hopes of getting Tim Duncan. It
didn't work. The Lakers rebuilt through trades and free agency and
basically ignored the draft with one major exception: 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers improved dramatically after their lottery foray,
going from 33 wins to 48 and advancing to the second round of the
playoffs. They benefited not only from Jones, but also from Cedric
Ceballos, who was acquired for a No. 1 pick, and from a new coach,
Del Harris. But it was the following year, 1996, that Lakers
general manager Jerry West had earmarked as the one that might
bring his franchise back to the top. Thinking, correctly, that a
new collective bargaining agreement might eliminate restricted free
agency, the Lakers cleared cap room to take a run at the most
potentially dominating man in the game: free agent-to-be Shaquille
O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics, as they are doing now, threw good money at the
ordinary, re-signing Brown and Rick Fox. That year, they had no
real cap room, but they did have the sixth pick and took Antoine
Walker. The Lakers had the 24th pick and took Derek Fisher. But in
between, at 13, went Kobe Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers were in the process of unloading players and
convinced Charlotte to draft Bryant at 13 and then deal him to LA
for center Vlade Divac. Who knows what would have happened had
Dallas (Samaki Walker), Indiana (Erick Dampier), Golden State (Todd
Fuller) or Cleveland (Vitaly Potapenko) taken Bryant. All we know
is that the four players taken ahead of him are no longer with the
team that drafted them.
</P>
<P>
   West spent a restless early July, jettisoning more salaries. He
somehow convinced Vancouver to take Anthony Peeler and George
Lynch, both of whom lasted a short spell in Canada. (Ex-Grizzlies
GM Stu Jackson deserves a Laker championship ring for bailing West
out.) He then had enough money, along with the other necessities,
to lure O'Neal to Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   The other LA first-round picks since Jones: Fisher, Sam
Jacobson, and Devean George. The Celtics' first-rounders since
Montross: Eric Williams, Walker, Ron Mercer, Chauncey Billups, and
Paul Pierce.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it took four years and three coaches for the Lakers to
finally put it all together. But there was always the expectation
that it eventually would happen; it just depended on when Shaq got
``it'' and if he stayed healthy. He did both this season,
delivering a truly remarkable year.
</P>
<P>
   In short, one team gambled, was proactive, and went creative.
That team will be defending its championship next season. The other
team lost on purpose, raved about its draft picks, returned
regularly to the lottery, and then paid $50 million to a marquee
college coach. It still is right where it was six years ago,
picking in the lottery, hoping for the best.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The NBA draft is Wednesday and no one has been busier than Magic
GM John Gabriel. Orlando has three of the first 13 picks, and that
means a lot of interviews, workouts, and nice dinners. ``It has
been incredibly exhausting,'' Gabriel said. ``Counting return
visits, we've probably had 45 guys come through.'' The Magic have
the fifth, 10th, and 13th picks, and Gabriel said the team likely
will hold on to two of them. What about all this talk about 5 and
10 to New Jersey for No. 1? ``I haven't talked to them since draft
day,'' Gabriel said. ``The thing with this draft is that it may be
easier to pick in the 7-10 range than it will be in the 2-5
range.'' The Bulls have two picks, 4 and 7, and the word is out
that they are not all that enthralled with Texas center Chris Mihm.
(In case you hadn't noticed, among the many Chicago needs is a big
man.) The Bulls had Minnesota shot-blocker Joel Przybilla in
Saturday for a second workout; he's a possibility at No. 7. Then
again, it could all be a Jerry Krause smoke screen; no one has seen
Mihm more this year than the accessible, affable Bulls general
manager. Jersey is still sitting at No. 1 and, with serious
questions about Jayson Williams and Kerry Kittles, may be looking
to get bodies and picks. Meanwhile, there's now talk that
high-schooler Darius Miles could go to the Clippers at No. 3, which
would be a mutual disaster . . . The status of Greek center Iakovos
Tsakalidis, meanwhile, continues to be murky. His Greek
representatives have hired veteran agent Bill Pollack, who insists
Tsakalidis will not return to AEK Athens next season under any
circumstances. ``That is not going to happen,'' Pollack said.
According to Pollack, AEK sent Tsakalidis a four-year, unilateral
contract on the kid's 21st birthday (June 10), a type of deal that
apparently is recognized only in Greece. But things have a way of
working out when drachmas are exchanged, although there has been no
buyout figure mentioned. Most NBA teams could pay only $350,000 _
the whole contract is reportedly around $1 million _ and, Pollack
said, ``The kid is willing to pay the difference. We just don't
have a number, and we may not have this resolved by draft day.''
Tsakalidis spent time recently in Florida recuperating from a bout
with bronchitis. He also had a recent workout with the Bulls . . .
Speaking of Chicago, center Will Perdue, who was released last
week, feels he has a shot at returning via the veteran's exception.
He turns 35 in August and would be eligible to make more than $1
million, a big drop from his $5.3 million salary last season. (Is
this a great country or what?) And Perdue's former Bulls teammate,
center Bill Wennington, who spent last season on the pine in
Sacramento (57 minutes over seven games), has decided enough is
enough and is calling it a career at the tender age of 37 . . . And
while we're on the subject, old friend Dino Radja, whose salary
finally comes off the Boston cap this year, has reached an
agreement to play for Olympiakos in Greece. It's being reported the
deal is for $2.2 million, but Eurosources say it's closer to $1.75
million. Rony Seikaly, whose endless arbitration case against the
Nets is close to being settled, is being courted by at least a
half-dozen teams in Europe. His preference is Greece, perhaps
Panathinaikos, but he also is holding out some hope of staying in
the NBA. He is 35.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here's something to snack on. At least one general manager
thinks the Celtics are very interested in Keyon Dooling, the
6-foot-3-inch point guard from Missouri. He has been sort of a
``workout wonder,'' but the Celtics have Kenny Anderson under
contract for three more years at, basically, immovable numbers.
Yes, they could use help at the position. But at No. 11 in a draft
with no decent point guards? . . . So, is Shaq the next advertising
darling now that he has finally won one in the pros? Johnson thinks
not. ``Big men don't sell products,'' Magic said. ``So, can Shaq be
that man? No. That's just the way it is. He can be the best player
in the league, but he can't lead the league. There's a difference.
It's like it was with Kareem. Shaq's the most dominant. But we need
a guy to be The Man in terms of like Michael Jordan. So who is that
going to be?'' . . . And, a final note on Phil Jackson. An hour
before his team's critical Game 7 against Portland, the Lakers
coach was in his office in Staples Center. Was he going over film,
working the phone, doing the chalk thing? No. He was mending his
pants . . . Larry Bird is going to wait for a couple of months to
see what happens with his bid to buy the Celtics. That's why he
didn't stay in Indiana. There's also another reason: Bird wants to
be the man in control, and that would not be the case in Indy.
While he gets along with Donnie Walsh, there are two owners he'd
have to answer to, and that would not be the case if he was
fronting an ownership group in Boston. He would be the man. Bird,
as he told the Globe last February, has people lined up to make a
serious run at the team; one figure being mentioned recently is
$400 million. Bird apparently has one, very rich individual on the
West Coast who could do a Mark Cuban and simply write a check. And
what of Rick Pitino? Well, his buyout figure would be taken care of
by the seller, not the buyer. All of this is moot, of course, if
Gaston is determined to hold on to the team. But just in case you
may have forgotten, Gaston took over the controls prior to the
start of the 1993-94 season. That was the last time the Celtics and
the Lakers were equals.

NIGERIAN HOPING TO STATE HIS CASE 
</HEADLINE>
 DRAFT-OYEDEJI-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WALTHAM, Mass. _ The boy's grandfather, a Nigerian warrior, died
three days before the boy was born. So his parents named him
Olumide, meaning, ``A warrior has come,'' believing he would follow
in his grandfather's footsteps.
</P>
<P>
   As Olumide Oyedeji matured, he wasn't expected to live out the
name. But he said, ``They would say in my language, a proverb that
says, `Your name determines what you're going to be,' your
lifestyle. `Sometimes your name follows you, your name talks for
you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, the 6-foot-10-inch, 242-pound wide-body touched
a basketball for the first time. Then his local soccer team noticed
the warrior stopped coming to practice.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he could often be found on one of the few basketball
courts in his homeland, discovering his exceptional strength and
fluidity.
</P>
<P>
   After successful stints on teams in Nigeria, he played in the
Russian Superleague for Dynamo
</P>
<P>
   Moscow. The past two seasons, he joined DJK S. Oliver Wurzburg
in Germany (Maverick Dirk Nowitzki's former team), averaging 12.1
points and 14.6 rebounds last season. In March, he impressed many
scouts at the Nike Hoop Summit.
</P>
<P>
   It appears the warrior had arrived. Oyedeji has earned accolades
in basketball circles throughout the world and wants to come to the
NBA. Shunning offers to play in Spain, Italy, and Greece, he made
himself eligible for the NBA draft, and is expected to be chosen
close to where the Celtics are picking (No. 11 overall).
</P>
<P>
   ``I have heard a lot of positive things (in workouts),'' said
Oyedeji, who worked out with the Celtics Wednesday. He signed with
Lon Babby, who also represents Grant Hill. Oyedeji was mentioned in
last year's draft, but was not picked.
</P>
<P>
   That won't be the case this year. He has worked out with Dallas
and Seattle and is expected to visit Detroit, Milwaukee, and
Chicago. ``They have told me I have a good upside,'' he said. ``I
can rebound and shoot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a good experience (traveling around the world) as a
young guy, mixing with people, seeing different people, different
cultures, different mentalities,'' said Oyedeji, who speaks fluent
English. ``The American mentality is different from the Russians.
It makes you mature, and you learn more about life.''
</P>
<P>
   He is regarded as a quick, strong player destined for the power
forward spot. Right now, his rebounding is his strong suit, but he
is also a good shot blocker. His offensive skills are limited, but
he can put the ball on the floor and challenge defenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a determined and powerful young man who had to leave his
country at an early age to pursue his dream, first in Russia, then
in Germany,'' said Celtics general manager Chris Wallace. ``He
showed very well at the Nike Hoop Summit in Indianapolis in March,
especially on the boards. He certainly looks like he's going to go
in the top 20 of the draft.''
</P>
<P>
   It was crucial for Oyedeji to leave Nigeria to pursue his
interests, a country still regarded as a soccer hotbed. He grew up
about 125 miles from the country's capital, Lagos, which has 10
million people.
</P>
<P>
   Basketball facilities are so scarce players must go to school to
play. ``You can only see the facilities in school. Basketball is
for wise people or smart, athletic people. (It's) not (the same)
for soccer. Everybody knows how to play soccer, whether you're
educated or illiterate.''
</P>
<P>
   Oyedeji received offers to play professionally in Spain, Italy,
and Greece and was recruited by Rutgers, Georgetown, Auburn, Texas,
and Boston University (he is good friends with former BU standout
Tunji Awojobi, who is also from Nigeria).
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me it was a good experience, a good school and they
treated him well,'' said Oyedeji, who says he wants to go directly
to the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Oyedeji had heard of Michael Jordan, Kevin McHale, Larry Bird,
and Magic Johnson, but only began following the NBA two years ago,
keeping up with teams on the satellite. ``I heard about the great
basketball tradition in Boston. I heard of the Lakers because of
Magic Johnson.''
</P>
<P>
   He is well aware most promising Nigerian pivots ultimately draw
comparisons to NBA great Hakeem Olajuwon.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's only going to be one Hakeem, definitely,'' said
Oyedeji. ``You just have to work hard to pay your dues. You have to
work hard. It depends on the individual. That will determine how
great you want to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most youths in Nigeria, Oyedeji played soccer growing up.
Then he started growing _ at 14, he was 6-5. One day in January
1995, he saw a group of kids playing basketball at his high school.
Noting many tall people gravitate to the sport, he decided to give
it a try.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just started playing basketball just for fun,'' he said.
``Then I started playing for Division 3 teams and I started taking
it serious. I was still playing soccer, but I stopped playing
soccer two years ago, finally.''
</P>
<P>
   Oyedeji participated in the Nike Hoop Summit last season but
didn't play well. He returned home to work on his game and was
determined to play better this season, particularly after being
named team captain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to show people how far I've improved in a year,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Though he wants to establish his own identity in the NBA,
Oyedeji has been influenced by players such as Kevin Garnett,
Alonzo Mourning, Olajuwon, Chris Webber, and Rasheed Wallace. ``I
haven't played against any of them yet,'' he said, ``but I hope to
in the near future.''
</P>
<P>
   Oyedeji has been able to find countrymen in most of the cities
he's traveled to, particularly Boston, Washington, and Dallas. But
he does not have a team preference.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a draft, and you have no choice until you're a free
agent,'' he said. ``You just pray to the Good Lord, have a good
workout, and hope everything goes well.''

REVOLUTION GET BAD CREW CUT 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ The Revolution remain in first place in the
Eastern Division for the ninth straight week, but their lead is
slipping away.
</P>
<P>
   They generated little offense, and John Harkes made a fateful
deflection that led to the tiebreaking goal in a 3-1 loss to the
Columbus Crew Saturday &UR;  &LR; night.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution have earned 26 points in 18 games, 1 more than
the MetroStars, who have played two fewer matches.
</P>
<P>
   The Crew converted the deciding goal in the 69th minute after
Harkes misplayed a ball near the center circle, sending it back
nearly 30 yards toward his own goal. Dante Washington outmaneuvered
Ivan McKinley, dodged a slide tackle from Brian Dunseth, and shot
off the right post. Jeff Cunningham scored on the rebound.
</P>
<P>
   Harkes had performed well for most of the game, but this error
was costly. And the Revolution, instead of improving offensively as
the match continued, lacked the attacking threat to recover.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a hard-paced ball and it hit hard off my left foot,''
Harkes said. ``It was just a reaction. Dante Washington then shoved
Ivan McKinley off the ball and took a shot. I was running back and
almost saved (Cunningham's) shot off the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mistakes are what soccer is all about. We need to be better in
attack. Wolde (Harris) seemed like he was on his own. Teams are
able, over 90 minutes, to wear us down and find our weaknesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Mauricio Ramos converted a free kick to tie the score, 1-1, in
the 19th minute, and the Revolution were threatening through the
middle of the field and from long range. But in the second half,
Harris, the lone striker in a 4-5-1 alignment, had only one
threatening shot, a 30-yard blast that skimmed the top of the goal
as goalkeeper Matt Napoleon tumbled backward into the net.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Fernando Clavijo blamed the deciding goal on inattention
by the defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``A player (McKinley) thought there should have been a foul
called and he stopped,'' Clavijo said. ``I tell the players every
day: `Do not stop until they see the flag go up and hear the
referee's whistle.' This was not a foul because I did not hear a
whistle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's those little things that cost us games.''
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution were actually in possession before the goal. But
Leonel Alvarez's pass apparently surprised Harkes and ended up near
the penalty area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was played in by one of our midfielders,''
Washington said. ``I ran with (McKinley) and we both challenged for
it with a shoulder charge, which is legal, and he went down. I saw
Brian West but I didn't think I could get the ball to him, and
after one of their other players slid in, I shot off the post.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really surprised the ball came out of midfield like
that, but once I saw it go back I went to pounce on it. It was a
very dangerous ball played into the box.''
</P>
<P>
   The play summarized the Revolution's night. It was the type of
pass Alvarez probably delivered to Colombian teammates thousands of
times in his career, a short, almost innocuous ball near the center
circle. But Harkes was not on the same wavelength, and it spoiled
what had been developing as a promising pairing in midfield.
</P>
<P>
   But Alvarez and Harkes will have another chance to compensate
since they will likely be the centers of attention when the
Revolution visit Miami July 4. Ramos will be suspended for
excessive cautions after receiving a yellow card in the 42d minute.
</P>
<P>
   Juergen Sommer brought an imposing presence to the goalkeeper
position in his MLS season debut, but was betrayed by an Adam Eyre
misplay in the 15th minute that led to a Jason Farrell goal. On the
third goal, by John Wilmar Perez, the Revolution, already missing
Rusty Pierce (back) and Mauricio Wright (suspended), had switched
to a gambling, three-man defense against three speedy Columbus
attackers.

SAMPRAS SET TO REKINDLE LOVE AFFAIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Pete Sampras in love probably isn't as big a story in
this town as ``Shakespeare in Love.'' I mean, it's not a major
movie, but that doesn't mean it won't be. The Bard was here first,
and that gives him an edge, but Pete has his midsummer night's
dream, too: a seventh Wimbledon championship.
</P>
<P>
   Seven smash hits on Centre Court _ a tennis yard that is built a
lot like Shakespeare's Globe Theatre _ would make him a leading man
strutting the stage of two centuries as the Bard did in overlapping
the 16th and 17th. His quest for the first of the 21st begins
Monday. Opening the two-week show for the sixth time _ the
champion's traditional privilege _ Pete will audition a bit player
named Jiri Vanek from the Czech Republic for the role of a fall
guy.
</P>
<P>
   You'd have to look past Vanek, No. 81 in the world, and back a
long way to find the man just plain Pete is seriously chasing: an
Edwardian dandy, William Charles Renshaw, who preferred to be
called Willie. He was seldom called on to offer a losing handshake
while setting the house record of seven titles between 1881 and
1889, the first six consecutively.
</P>
<P>
   Willie lost one final, 1890; Pete has lost none. The drill is a
little tougher in our era of Pete I. The lucky number in this
crapshoot also is seven. Seven wins and you clean the table.
</P>
<P>
   Willie Renshaw's task was simplified by the challenge-round
system of his day. The defending champion hung out idly until the
last day of the tournament, when he was expected to break a sweat
by playing one match against the survivor of the tournament proper:
the challenger. That format lasted until 1922, when everybody
started as equal as today. Thus, Willie's six straight titles
covered only 10 matches. He was 22-3 lifetime here, while Sampras
is 52-5.
</P>
<P>
   But, back to Pete in love. His Juliet is an American television
actress named Bridgette Wilson, for whom the perfect engagement
ring would glitter with 20 diamonds: a Renshaw-tying seventh
Wimbledon plus an Emerson-eclipsing 13th major title. Oh, yes,
Aussie Roy Emerson, who won his 12th major _ the French _ 33 years
ago, is the other pigeon on Pete's hunting list.
</P>
<P>
   Pete actually fell for the Sporting Lady of London SW 19 _
Centre Court _ long before setting eyes on Bridgette, his recently
declared fiancee. Often referred to as feminine (like a ship) by
her beauticians, CeeCee is a capricious shrew Pete has tamed better
than anyone before him. (Renshaw's titles were won on her
predecessor at the Worple Road Ground, abandoned in 1922.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought about Centre Court a lot as a kid playing on
concrete in Southern California,'' Sampras said. ``I always felt
when I changed my game to serve-and-volley'' _ from double-fisted
backhanding and baselining _ ``that grass was going to be the
surface I was going to break through on, and I would love playing
on grass.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not, however, love at first smite. The memory is of Pete
as an unhappy, puzzled, and lonely-looking teenager in 1989, when
he made his debut in a defeat, to Todd Woodbridge on Court 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, actually it was much different,'' Sampras said. ``I was
18 when I came over to Wimbledon, and I didn't like the surface.
Couldn't really return that well. Didn't like the bad bounces.
Really had a pessimistic attitude on grass. It wasn't until I
started working with (coach) Tim Gullikson, and then in 1992 got to
the semis of Wimbledon. It wasn't until that point that I felt like
I could possibly win here. I didn't realize I was going to win the
next six out of seven, but I think that in 1992 I was able to kind
of get over the hump and realize that I was able to play well on
grass.''
</P>
<P>
   Gullikson, who died in 1996, oversaw the installation of an
invaluable chip backhand. At first, Pete thought it was
old-fashioned stuff, a la his targets, Renshaw and Emerson. But any
hacker at Boston's Longwood Cricket Club could have told the
reluctant kid that it's a necessity for winning on the green. Even
backcourt-haunting Bjorn Borg developed effective
chipping-and-charging, awkward-looking though it was with his
two-hander, as he won five straight Wimbledons, and became enamored
of CeeCee.
</P>
<P>
   ``My appreciation of Centre has gotten greater and greater over
the years,'' Sampras said. ``I just love it. The other day I just
went down to the club, had a workout, and walked around the
grounds. I made a special trip to Centre and just, you just stand
there and look around at the stadium, look at the court, look how
plush it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``You walk through the gates, you look at the place, the grass,
and how green it is. No sponsors signs like you see in other
stadiums, and it is definitely _ it is our biggest tournament. It's
our Super Bowl. You walk on Centre, it's like a cathedral. You
don't feel that really anywhere except for Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved watching the tournament on TV as a kid, and now I've
won here six times, and certainly I'd like to add to that over the
next four, five years. I feel like the whole world is watching.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be watching again as he romances Centre once more. He
wasn't admitted to her sanctum, beguiled by her charms, until 1992,
a victory over the same Aussie, Woodbridge, who had spoiled Pete's
coming-out party three years before. He has lost only twice on the
planet's prime tennis plot: to Goran Ivanisevic in the 1992 semis,
and to Richard Krajicek in the 1996 quarters. Krajicek, who
succeeded Pete as champ, is the lone scratch on the chrome of 46
victories in his last 47 Wimbledon starts.
</P>
<P>
   With his loves, Bridgette and CeeCee, nearby, Pete will have it,
in the Bard's words, ``As you like it!''

CHINA CRUISES

   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ For 20 minutes, it was a game. Guatemala
kept the powerful Chinese from scoring a goal. In the 21st minute,
however, it broke down.
</P>
<P>
   China won the opening-round game in the Women's Gold Cup at
Foxboro Stadium, 14-0, Saturday. And that was without Chinese star
Sun Wen, who is sidelined by a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody made a good effort in the first 20 minutes,'' said
Guatemala coach Graco Lopez. ``The game is 90 minutes, though. We
were out there trying, but we've got to do it for the full 90
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game was a learning experience. We were lacking in our
offense, but I thought for 20 minutes, things seemed to be rather
positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Jin Yan scored China's first two goals _ in the 21st and 26th
minutes. Zhang Ouying notched four goals and four assists while
teammate Shui Qingxia had three goals as China unloaded 45 shots.
</P>
<P>
   The inexperienced Guatemalans took one shot the entire game, a
Claudia Galvez lob from 25 yards out that Chinese goalkeeper Gao
Hong handled with ease.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have liked to have had more offense,'' said Lopez,
whose team is still in the organizational stages. ``We knew what to
expect. We knew it would be a difficult game. They were a lot
faster than we were.''
</P>
<P>
   Guatemalan netminder Susana De Leon made 15 saves, nine in the
first half.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really thought it would be difficult, though,'' said De
Leon, who twisted her left ankle in the 31st minute but continued
to play. ``I thought it would be harder. They took a lot of shots
from a distance, but they were real fast, though.''
</P>
<P>
   China coach Ma Yuanan liked his team's effort _ even in the
first 20 minutes. ``Soccer's a game that's quite exciting, and it's
attacking as well,'' he said through a translator. ``That's what we
were doing in those first 20 minutes. We did take our chances over
that time. We did throughout the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought without Sun Wen it would be more entertaining. This
was kind of a warmup for us. We played hard every minute and we
played in order to have success.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Mexico plays Guatemala and China meets Canada in
Hershey, Pa., in this Group B round robin. China and Canada met
June 8 in the Pacific Cup, tying, 2-2, in regulation, with Canada
winning on penalty kicks.
</P>
<P>
   Ma would not discuss the possibility of a rubber game with the
United States _ China beat the United States, 1-0, May 31 in the
opening round of the Pacific Cup; the United States beat China on
penalty kicks in the World Cup last July.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will give you my opinion if we meet (the US); that would be
after the game,'' he said. ``It's hard to make it clear now. I'll
see you after the final for the answer.''

<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Kent Bottenfield, wearing a print shirt and
shorts, was the picture of comfort as he stood at his locker.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was the Minnesota Twins looked the same way at the
plate.
</P>
<P>
   The Twins, behind five RBI from Marcus Jensen, welcomed
Bottenfield back from the disabled list by digging in and peppering
the right-hander in an 11-5 victory over the Anaheim Angels before
28,917 Saturday night at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   The loss prevented the Angels from making up any ground on
Oakland, which had its nine-game winning streak snapped, and left
them 5 games out of first place and 4 games behind second-place
Seattle in the AL West.
</P>
<P>
   It also marked the fifth time this season that the Angels have
failed to extend a winning streak past three games.
</P>
<P>
   The sore shoulder that sent Bottenfield to the disabled list was
fine. Not so for his countenance.
</P>
<P>
   From now on, he said, there will be no more Mr. Nice Guy.
</P>
<P>
   After the Twins delivered three big hits --- a ground-rule
double by Jensen and homers by Jacque Jones and Corey Koskie --- to
the opposite field, Bottenfield came to the conclusion that he must
pitch inside more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt good, but I pitched like crap,'' Bottenfield said.
``They had a lot of guys diving and that's got to stop. I didn't
back guys off the plate. They were too comfortable at the plate.
I've given up 16 homers and that's got to stop. Guys have been too
comfortable for the last 2 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys feet are set, they call time out and dig in a little
more. Bob Gibson and Don Drysdale would knock them down the first
pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Bottenfield, who struck out nine against Tampa Bay last month by
working inside, nibbled at the strike zone as if he were eating a
sandwich crust first.
</P>
<P>
   He walked four batters --- two of whom scored --- and even when
he was ahead of the Twins, he had a hard time putting them away in
his five innings of work.
</P>
<P>
   Bottenfield struck out four, but three were in the first two
innings.
</P>
<P>
   It was Jones' home run that irked Bottenfield most.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who lunged at a low and away offspeed pitch, hit a fly
ball that landed just inside the foul pole down the left-field line
and put Minnesota ahead for good, 5-4, in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, the second-year center fielder from USC, said it was
clear after the first time through the order that Bottenfield was
willing to live on the outside corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually he didn't come in unless he was deep in the count,''
Jones said. ``He was throwing a lot of pitches away and we
recognized that. If he's going to beat you, then you want to make
him beat you in.''
</P>
<P>
   The Twins handed a 3-0 lead to Angel-killer Eric Milton, but
consecutive homers by Garret Anderson, Troy Glaus and Scott Spiezio
--- all on letter-high fastballs --- evened the score in the
second. It was the second time this season that the Angels have hit
three consecutive homers.
</P>
<P>
   Benji Gil, who tied a career high with three hits, scored on
Anderson's single in the third to give the Angels a 4-3 lead, but
it proved to be a paradise lost against Milton. The left-hander,
who no-hit the Angels in September and entered the game with a
20-inning scoreless streak against them, didn't allow a runner into
scoring position until he left at the end of the seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   By then the Twins owned an 8-4 lead and they added three more
against Shigetoshi Hasegawa in the ninth. Injury was added to
insult when Glaus, whose homer was his team-leading 23rd of the
season, left with back spasms in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Glaus, who was in the DH role because of the spasms, is expected
to take today off.
</P>
<P>
   It became clear in the seventh that it just wasn't the Angels'
night.
</P>
<P>
   Angels manager Mike Scioscia walked Denny Hocking with two out
and a runner at second only to have Jensen, 0 for 18 as a
right-handed batter this season, drive a two-run double to
left-center. Jensen, who entered the game with a .176 average, had
a ninth-inning RBI to double his season total in one night.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just flat out beat us,'' Scioscia said.

ORPIK SLIPS A BIT 
</HEADLINE>
 DRAFT-ORPIK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALGARY, Alberta _ Brooks Orpik had to a wait a little longer
than he expected Saturday to be selected in the NHL entry draft.
The Boston College blue liner, ranked as the second-best defenseman
available in North America, wasn't picked until 18th.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the surprise, he went to the Pittsburgh Penguins.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were probably the only team that didn't interview me,''
said Orpik, who had no fewer than three interviews with the
Edmonton Oilers, who owned the 17th pick. ``I'd be lying if I said
I wasn't getting a little anxious. From everything I heard, I
thought I'd go in the top 10. But it's not a day to be
disappointed. I couldn't be any happier than the way things worked
out.''
</P>
<P>
   The other interesting twist, from a New England perspective, was
that University of Lowell blue liner Ron Hainsey, from Bolton,
Conn., was claimed ahead of Orpik, selected 13th overall by the
Canadiens. The NHL's Central Scouting Bureau figured the
smooth-skating Hainsey to be the third-best North American blue
liner available.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little surprised, again because of the rankings,''
said Orpik, reflecting on Hainsey going ahead of him. ``Some of it
is based on what a team needs, so that factors in, too. I'm glad to
see it for him. He's a good player _ we played together in the
World Junior tournament in Sweden.''
</P>
<P>
   Orpik, from East Amherst, N.Y., planned to celebrate a little
Saturday &UR;  &LR; night in Calgary, beginning with a barbecue at the home
of Krys Kolanos, his BC teammate who was selected 19th overall by
the Phoenix Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Orpik, Kolanos, who projects as a scoring wing in the
NHL, had a feeling the Coyotes would take him. He met with
management before the draft and picked up vibes that he might be a
Desert Dog before the day was out. Nonetheless, when he heard his
named called in Calgary, his hometown, he wasn't prepared for his
emotional reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing's exhilarating,'' he said. ``I had butterflies
all morning. When the time came, I was shaking. I think my legs
went numb.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig Patrick, the Pittsburgh general manager, and his Phoenix
counterpart, Bobby Smith, both said they figure they'll wait awhile
before signing the BC players. Unless things change dramatically
over the summer _ and money often changes everything _ Jerry York
likely will have both of them back in the Eagles' lineup for the
2000-01 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really encourage that here,'' said York, whose squad made it
to the Frozen Four again this spring. ``I like the fact they get
their education and their athletics. In a perfect world, they'll
have long NHL careers, and with their degrees, they'll have
something to fall back on when they're done with hockey at the
ancient age of, say, 37 years old.''
</P>
<P>
   York compared Orpik with Dallas defenseman Derian Hatcher, one
of the NHL's best hitters. Hainsey, he said, was more like
Detroit's Nicklas Lidstrom, more of a puckhandling defenseman who
can man the point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hainsey's a very good player,'' he said. ``He's got great
offensive skills. My guy's bigger and stonger, more physical.
Hainsey's probably quicker. When you're making those kind of
choices, it's an eye-of-the-beholder thing. It's not so much who
the player is as what kind of player he is.''
</P>
<P>
   One key factor in Orpik getting scooped by the Penguins was
Pittsburgh scout Neil Shea, an ex-Eagle who has kept a watchful eye
over the blossoming prospect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know him inside and out,'' said an ecstatic Shea, explaining
how the Penguins selected Orpik without having first interviewed
him. ``When he was still there, there was absolutely no debate _ he
was our guy. Done. He's got great character, great work ethic. I'd
be shocked if there is anyone in this draft with better work
ethic.''

MACTAVISH HAS WHAT IT TAKES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALGARY, Alberta _ The Oilers made a good choice Thursday by
naming Craig MacTavish their head coach. Mac-T, as he came to be
known here in his playing days with the Bruins in the early '80s,
is bright and energetic, well spoken, and honest.
</P>
<P>
   Now 41 years old, MacTavish made the point in his news
conference of saying he inherited a quality team. OK, we'll let him
stretch the truth a little, first day on the job.
</P>
<P>
   The Oilers have some good, young talent, but they're merely a
shell of the great Edmonton squads that won five Cups, three with
MacTavish in uniform, during the Northern Alberta dynasty years.
For the better part of 10 years now, the Oilers have been fighting
the bloody battle of a Canadian small-market team in a league with
spiraling player salaries and an ever-shrinking Canadian dollar
(vs. America's coin of the realm).
</P>
<P>
   The drudgery finally got to Glen Sather, leading the architect
of those great Oilers squads to bolt to New York this spring as the
Rangers' makeover man. His departure was his white flag of
surrender.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no one is better qualified than MacTavish to deal with
restrictions. He learned how to cope with a minimum when he served
his one-year sentence in the Massachusetts penal system, after
pleading guilty to vehicular homicide in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Traveling north on Route 1 in Peabody, after a few hours of
merriment, MacTavish rear-ended a Ford Pinto driven by Kim Radley,
a 26-year-old antiques dealer from West Newfield, Maine. Radley's
car flipped, trapping her inside, and four days later she died of
head injuries.
</P>
<P>
   MacTavish spent three months of his sentence in a 40-square-foot
cell, about twice the size of a net opening, at the Essex County
House of Correction, the Salem jail built in 1812. During lockdown
hours, from 8 p.m. to 9 a.m., there were no bathroom privileges,
beyond the standard-issue bucket tucked into the corner.
</P>
<P>
   MacTavish has spoken little of his days in the lockup. Upon his
release, he told the Globe's Michael Madden, ``When people hear my
name now, I'm sure they're going to say, `There's Craig MacTavish _
he made that terrible mistake.' ''
</P>
<P>
   More than 15 years later, MacTavish has four Stanley Cup rings
(three with the Oilers, one with the Rangers), and  &UR; today &LR;  he has
the charge of trying to help rebuild a franchise that can barely
survive in today's NHL economic environment.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, MacTavish has been a solid citizen on and off
the ice from the time he was set free. If there were whispers
(``There's Craig MacTavish . . . ''), they have faded with time.
Given a second chance, he thrived. Now we find out if he can teach
others to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Remember, free agency begins Saturday. A little more than two
months ago, when he was retained as Bruins coach, Pat Burns said he
couldn't stop smiling over the prospect of some of the names Harry
Sinden and Mike O'Connell tossed around as possible free agent
hires in the Hub. Now we get to see if there is any bite behind the
smile. If Don Sweeney packs up as expected _ look for Mike Milbury
to make a serious bid to lure him to Long Island _ it will be all
the more imperative for Sinden and O'Connell to add experience to
the back line. Lyle Odelein, last seen in Phoenix (claimed Friday
by Columbus), might fit the job description and the payroll (about
$2 million a year). He also has the nasty streak the Bruins
desperately need. For skill, hard-shooting Vladimir Malakhov could
be the best blue liner available, but he made $4 million last year,
making him an uneasy financial fit here . . . Rumors circulated in
Philadelphia early last week that ex-Bruin Ray Bourque was on his
way from Denver to Philly in a swap for Eric Lindros and/or Chris
Therien. ``Preposterous, that's the only word I can attach to
that,'' said Steve Freyer, who only days before negotiated the deal
that brought Bourque back to the Avalanche for at least one more
season. ``There were very specific reasons the Avs wanted to sign
Ray _ specifics I can't repeat. But they made it clear to us that
they see Ray as an integral part of the team, a key part of what
they need to get to the next level.'' . . . New Jersey netminder
Martin Brodeur, now with his name on the Stanley Cup twice,
sometimes doesn't get enough credit for his puckhandling skills.
``His greatest skill may be his ability to see the play
unfolding,'' says former netminder John Davidson. ``He is so fast
at that. It's like a quarterback who has the ability to read the
rush. He can take that instant picture with his mind. When I
played, I'd take the picture, too, but I'd have to take the film to
a pharmacy, drop it off, and pick up the pictures two days later.
It's too late then. Brodeur's got an Instamatic.'' . . . Guy
Carbonneau hasn't said for sure, but the bet around Dallas is that
the NHL's oldest performer (40) will be back for another season
with the Stars. ``If he left, the place we would miss him most is
on the ice,'' said Dallas coach Ken Hitchcock, noting that Carbo's
value is more than just a voice of experience in the dressing room.
``He's out there for the last minute of every period. Where do you
find those kinds of guys?''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Leafs figured they would lose Kevyn Adams, once a Bruins'
first-round draft pick, in Friday's expansion draft. They were
right. Adams joined ex-Bruins Mattias Timander and Steve Heinze on
the Columbus Blue Jackets' roster. Toronto could have kept Adams on
its protected list, but it would have come at the risk of leaving
another ex-Bruin, Dmitri Khristich, exposed. But what would have
been the risk, really? Khristich's deal next season calls for $3
million, and neither the Blue Jackets nor the Wild would have
interest in spending that kind of coin for someone with Khristich's
inconsistency . . . Another story out of Philly last week had Roger
Neilson, bumped off the Flyers' head coaching job by Craig Ramsay,
weighing an offer from Tampa Bay to be the Bolts' associate head
coach and assistant GM. Only one problem, said Lightning GM Rick
Dudley, there was no offer to Neilson . . . No doubt Dudley ruffled
some feathers just hours before the draft when he accused GMs of
years past of being a sleepy lot. Dudley: ``Being conservative has
been a way of life for NHL executives for 1,000 years. It's not
that way anymore.'' That sense of leave-it-alone lethargy, however,
rendered a good many franchises stagnant in the '80s and '90s.
Dudley arrived in Tampa Bay with picks 5 and 8 in the first round
and made it clear he was eager to deal for a player or two who
could make an impact in 2000-01 . . . If they stick to their stated
mission, the Flames will go up for sale this week, undoubtedly
destined for a US city, unless they sell 1,300-plus season tickets
in the next five days. But don't be surprised if ownership,
encouraged by a 25 percent increase in season tickets since
season's end, keeps the Flames in place for at least one more
season . . . Freyer will be looking to find former BU blue liner
Jon Coleman a job after July 1. San Jose property, he just wrapped
up his third year in the minors, with a marked improvement in his
plus-minus, from minus-20 in 1998-99 to plus-17 in 1999-00.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Arbitrator Lawrence Holden has to render his Alexei Yashin
decision this week, determining whether Ottawa's estranged center
is a Group 2 free agent or whether he must come back to the
Senators and work for the $3.6 million on the last year of his
deal. Either way, look for Yashin to be dealt. The hottest rumor
recently had him going to Chicago for a package that included
Alexei Zhamnov, Anders Eriksson, junior center Mark Bell (the No. 8
pick in '98), and a first-round draft choice. GM Mike Smith
promptly struck that one down before the draft, saying, ``There's a
limited market for disgruntled players asking for $8 million, $10
million, or $11 million a year.'' . . . Don't bet against the
Islanders getting into the Yashin hunt. They need a legitimate
franchise player and Milbury, with new ownership approved by league
governors last week, has permission to spend and a mandate to shape
a competitive team . . . Phil Esposito, who won't be returning to
Ch. 38 as a color man this season, says he'd like to join an NHL
front office, assessing talent and aiding in player-personnel moves
. . . For those who may have forgotten the worst trade in Bruins
history: After selecting Ken Dryden 14th overall in the 1964 draft
(four rounds, 24 players), the Bruins swapped the future Hall of
Famer to the Canadiens, along with Alec Campbell, for Guy Allen and
Paul Reid. None of the other three players in the trade ever played
in the NHL. ``I won't say who it was,'' recalled Ron Caron, who in
later years ran the draft for Montreal, ``but I am sure someone
made a call to (former Canadiens GM) Sam Pollock and said, `You
know, Sam, you made a mistake. You should have taken Dryden.'' . .
. If the Flyers don't offer Lindros at least a one-year deal at
$8.5 million by Friday night, he becomes an unrestricted free
agent. One possible reason for the delay: industry-wide, for all
sports, it is becoming considerably more costly to insure athletes
against injury. Some underwriters have left the business entirely.
Others have jacked up the premiums to absurd levels. If the Flyers
want to take the risk of signing L'Enfant Terrible, even with his
history of concussions, they might not be able to mitigate that
risk, even by spending another $1 million or $2 million as a hedge
against catastrophic injury . . . The Sharks don't figure to bring
back Jeff Norton, of Acton and Cushing Academy, at his $2.5 million
option. At the right price ($1 million?), he could still lend some
stability to a blue line . . . The three veterans Colorado exposed
in the expansion draft were all ex-Bruins: Dave Andreychuk, Jeff
Odgers, and Dave Reid. Of the three, only Reid is certain to return
to the Avalanche next season. Odgers and ex-Bruins Joe Juneau
(Ottawa) and Cam Stewart (Florida) got picked by the Wild.
Minnesota traded Juneau to Phoenix for Swedish prospect Rickard
Wallin, a center . . . Overlooked in all the hype surrounding BU
goalie Rick DiPietro in this weekend's draft: The Wild recently
signed St. Lawrence free agent Derek Gustafson, the freshman who
backstopped Joe Marsh's Saints to the Frozen Four. Gustafson, who
turned 21 last week, was the ECAC rookie of the year with marks of
17-4-2, a 2.09 goals-against average, and a .936 save percentage.
He stopped 72 BU shots in the Saints' victory in the NCAA regional
that went to four OTs.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers left Alexandre Daigle exposed for Castaway Friday,
the expansion draft that stocked Columbus and Minnesota. To no
one's surprise, he remained Blueshirt property _ at least until
Sather drops him or moves him for a bucket of pucks. Late in the
1999-00 season, then-coach John Muckler went around the Rangers
dressing room, asking each player what it would mean to them if the
club made the playoffs. According to Muckler, Daigle said, ``It
means, if I play well, I'll get another contract.'' Muckler's
response: ``Wrong answer.'' Muckler doesn't believe hockey is the
first priority in Daigle's life. ``He likes everything about hockey
_ except the playing,'' said Muckler . . . One voice in the know
believes the Penguins at least will extend Kevin Stevens an
invitation to training camp in September. Former Rangers GM Neil
Smith had a deal worked out to send Stevens to the Penguins late in
the season, but the swap was derailed when Stevens was arrested in
March for possession of crack cocaine . . . Remember the days when
it seemed the Canadiens entered the draft with at least a pair of
first-round picks? Witness, in '68 they held the top three picks:
1. Michel Plasse, 2. Roger Belisle, and 3. Jim Pritchard, and
followed a year later with picks No. 1 (Rejean Houle) and 2 (Marc
Tardif). Well, Saturday they entered with two first-round picks (13
and 16) for the first time since 1985, when they took Jose
Charbonneau (12) and Tom Chorske (16) . . . Deron Quint, of Tabor
Academy and the 30th pick overall (Winnipeg) in the 1994 draft,
went into Saturday hoping the Devils finally would deal him. Quint
was exiled within days after the Devils acquired him from Phoenix,
GM Lou Lamoriello firmly stating he would never again pull on a
Devils sweater . . . Evgeny Ryabchikov, wherever you are, here's
hoping you invested that signing bonus wisely.

TURNABOUT DOESN'T PLEASE INTIMIDATOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It may be a well-worn cliche, but what goes around
usually comes around, especially in racing. Jeremy Mayfield's
``bump and run'' victory over Dale Earnhardt in last Monday's
Pocono 500 was proof positive.
</P>
<P>
   Mayfield's triumph, in which he bumped Earnhardt's black No. 3
Goodwrench Chevrolet from behind on the final lap to cause the
Intimidator to fall out of the lead, was akin to the class runt
whuppin' up on the schoolyard bully.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never intentionally tried to wreck him or anything,''
Mayfield said, afterward. ``We just wanted to rattle his cage a
little bit, and that was it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayfield's comments were an obvious aside to identical remarks
Earnhardt made last August at Bristol, Tenn., where he rear-ended
Terry Labonte on the last lap to win the race, saying afterward he
only meant to rattle Labonte's cage.
</P>
<P>
   As Mayfield took his victory lap around the 2.5-mile triangular
track at Pocono International Raceway, receiving the thumbs up from
many of his colleagues, Earnhardt pulled alongside Mayfield's No.
12 Mobil 1 Ford Taurus and offered his own one-fingered salute.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just told him he was No. 1,'' Earnhardt said.
</P>
<P>
   This is why people love NASCAR so much _ because the drivers'
raw and unfiltered emotions often spill out onto the track, adding
a good-vs.-evil element of conflict to the plot of each week's
event. If Sunday's Save Mart/Kragen 300 at Sears Point Raceway were
billed as a World Wrestling Federation steel cage match, the
headline bout no doubt would pit the Intimidator vs. the Defiant
One.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt like he hit me,'' Earnhardt said of Mayfield's rough
tactics. ``I don't know if he did or not. He took the air off
something. It hadn't done that before with any cars behind me. He
got me. He drove that sucker 10 car-lengths deeper than he had been
driving it all day.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mayfield countered with the same defense Earnhardt has often
used himself in such circumstances (and there have been many
throughout his 21-year career).
</P>
<P>
   ``That's hard-nosed racing,'' said Mayfield, who joined Tony
Stewart and Dale Earnhardt Jr. as the only two-time winners this
season. ``A lot of people talk about Dale Earnhardt coming up the
hard way and driving that way. So did I. I just haven't been in the
situation to do that yet. I'm just as hard-nosed as he is. You have
to do what you have to do to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hadn't forgotten about the 10 times he got me,'' he added.
``I'm not intimidated by Dale Earnhardt, and never will be.''
</P>
<P>
   While Mayfield won the undying admiration of his peers
(``Earnhardt got a little bit of his own medicine, and everybody
knows it,'' said one driver), he seemed to become a NASCAR cult
hero.
</P>
<P>
   When he returned to his Lake Norman, N.C., home Monday night,
his answering machine malfunctioned after it was flooded with
congratulatory messages. A backup also went on the blink. Then, on
Tuesday, Mayfield participated in an online chat on NASCAR's Web
site and was besieged with a record 61,000 hits, nearly 10 times
the normal amount.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may sound weird, but it was like a dream-come-true race
for me,'' Mayfield said. ``To win like this, to pass Dale
Earnhardt, to come to the final corner and get him loose and then
do that, I don't think I can ever top that one in terms of wins.
That's pretty awesome. If I don't do anything else in my career
that will mean a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't a total loss of a weekend for Earnhardt. Although he
was thwarted from a victory that may have vaulted him into the
points lead _ he remains 57 points behind leader Bobby Labonte
headed into Sunday's race at Sonoma, Calif. _ Earnhardt did receive
a warm Father's Day gift from his oldest son Kerry, who recorded
the first victory of his career in last Saturday's ARCA race at
Pocono . . . Jeff Gordon, who has won the last five straight road
races on the NASCAR Winston Cup circuit, will attempt to extend his
streak to six Sunday at Sears Point, Calif., where last year he
battled flu-like symptoms and searing heat that sapped him of his
energy and left him barely able to climb out of his car in Victory
Lane. This year, Gordon knows he'll face some stiff competition
from savvy road course racers such as Mark Martin, Rusty Wallace,
Ricky Rudd, Scott Pruett, Jerry Nadeau, Robby Gordon, and Wally
Dallenbach. ``There are so many guys who can win,'' said Gordon,
who has won only once in 15 races this season. ``Of course, you've
got Mark Martin, who chased me last year, and Rusty Wallace. I used
to watch Scott Pruett race go-karts here (at Sonoma) and he's
tough, and a road racer like Jerry Nadeau will be very strong. I
could go on, but you will have a lot of guys who will improve on
what they had.'' . . . Tracy Gordon (no relation to Jeff) is on a
bit of a roll in the Busch North Series. Gordon, of Strong, Maine,
captured his third consecutive victory last weekend at Jennerstown,
Pa., to go along with triumphs at Holland (N.Y.) International
Speedway June 3 and at Beech Ridge Motor Speedway in Scarborough,
Maine, June 10. ``We have been very fortunate the past three
weeks,'' said Gordon, who leads Brad Leighton by 52 points in the
driver standings. ``We have hit on a combination that is working
right now and we hope that it leads to the series championship.
That is our goal.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Rahal, who was installed as CART's interim president and
CEO after Andrew Craig was forced to resign last week, attended a
state dinner at the White House last Tuesday night honoring the
King of Morocco. During a teleconference Wednesday, Rahal joked
that he did not petition the monarch to stage a CART race in
Morocco, but he indicated his immediate priorities were to set
CART's 2001 schedule and to raise the level of awareness of
open-wheel racing in America, specifically the CART FedEx
Championship Series. ``Those are the things we can do,'' he said.
``If we do that on site; I think if we do that in the marketplace,
that is going to help generate TV numbers. We have got to enlist
people. We have got to get them excited about what we are doing and
when you go to a Long Beach, you see what kind of excitement can be
generated . . . But I think the big thing is taking our drivers,
getting them out into the marketplace, making them more well known
than they already may be in different venues; really merchandising
the sport. I think if we do that, and we do it correctly, that
starts to drive a lot of these other issues that are problems for
us.'' . . . Helio Castroneves delivered car owner Roger Penske his
101st victory when he scored the first of his CART driving career
in last weekend's Tenneco Automotive Grand Prix in Detroit. The
excitable Brazilian driver celebrated in an unusual manner when he
stopped his Marlboro Team Penske Honda/Reynard on the front
straightaway of the Belle Isle circuit, unbuckled himself, and
stirred up the crowd when he jumped up on the fence in front of the
grandstands. ``Team Penske gave me the opportunity this year to
achieve my dream,'' said Castroneves, who became the seventh
different winner in seven CART races this season. ``Today
everything was going in the right direction.'' After the race,
Castroneves visited injured colleague Tony Kanaan, who suffered a
fractured arm and ribs after a wall crash last Saturday morning.
Castroneves said Kanaan was in good spirits when he offered the
following suggestion: ``Hey, man, should I stay here a little bit
and fix your nose?'' . . . Eddie Cheever vaulted into the points
lead of the Northern Light Indy Racing League standings after his
victory last weekend in the Radisson 200 at Pikes Peak (Colo.)
International Raceway. Cheever, who has finished all five races
this season while leading the most laps of any IRL driver (1,207),
delivered the first victory for the Nissan Infiniti engine program,
ending a 33-race drought. ``Today I had an advantage and that
advantage was the powerplant in the back of my car,'' said Cheever,
whose victory gave him an 8-point lead over Buddy Lazier, 176-168,
in the standings.

MADISON IS BUILDING TRUST WITH DOLPHINS? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Gene Burrough, an agent for 30 years who has
represented football stars such as Billy Sims, Deion Sanders, Jim
McMahon, Hugh Douglas, and LeRoy Butler, thinks the media missed
the boat regarding the recent signing of Dolphins cornerback Sam
Madison to an eight-year, $54 million deal with an $11 million
signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't just the enormous amount that was the story, but the
way the contract was structured _ Madison put $7 million of the
bonus into a trust that could easily expand to more than $20
million (based on a 20 percent return) by the end of the eight-year
deal. The kickers are that the Dolphins have final approval on
which money manager Madison chooses and they can recover part of
the bonus if Madison somehow defaults on the contract.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, it looks like a deal that may change the way
agents and football teams do business. NFL teams love the concept,
Madison and Burrough do as well, but the National Football League
Players' Association isn't going to like it, and when it finally
looks over the fine print, it will likely advise agents not to
engage in this type of deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly,'' said NFLPA spokesman Carl Francis, ``we haven't
been able to review the contract in its entirety yet. At that point
we'll be able to offer a clear opinion on how we feel about it. It
does appear to be a very unique deal.''
</P>
<P>
   The Detroit Lions would have benefited if they had signed Barry
Sanders to such a deal. They had gone to great lengths to recoup
part of his bonus even though language in most NFL contracts
requires the player give back a prorated portion of the bonus in
case of voluntary retirement.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos have had a tougher time trying to recover $1.8
million of cornerback Dale Carter's $7.8 million bonus. Carter was
suspended by the NFL for a year for violating the league's
substance abuse policy.
</P>
<P>
   Those on the players' side feel that this type of contract might
be taking away basic rights the union has fought for. In fact,
there's some question as to whether the contract takes away
Madison's right to a second opinion on a medical situation and his
ability to grieve a team fine or disciplinary action. The contract
extends four years beyond the current basic agreement and two years
after the contract can be amortized.
</P>
<P>
   Just what did Burrough and the Dolphins do?
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to Sam and I said, `Is $11 million enough to live on?'
He said, `Of course it is,' so I said, `Why not put most of it in a
trust? The numbers say he could have at least $20 million
guaranteed in eight years. The team is protected and Sam's future
is protected.''
</P>
<P>
   Only in football could a deal like this be possible because the
contracts are not guaranteed. The Red Sox recently tried to find a
loophole to get out of the final 1 1/2 years of John Valentin's
contract. The Red Sox were willing to say that Valentin followed
the wrong procedure in having his surgery performed, thus
nullifying the contract.
</P>
<P>
   If he played football, Valentin would have been long gone,
similar to what the Patriots did to Bruce Armstrong. In football,
all that's guaranteed is the signing bonus, providing the player
doesn't quit prematurely or suffer an off-field injury or commit a
crime.
</P>
<P>
   While the Dolphins do not have a hand in picking the actual
investment funds, they would certainly be able to step in if the
investments were too risky. Burrough said the Dolphins will also
receive monthly statements on how Madison's money is doing.
</P>
<P>
   While the deal sounds obtrusive and could never fly in other
sports, the team and the player appear quite content.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not rocket science,'' said Burrough, who works out of
Jacksonville, Fla. ``We have a player who is willing to take part
in this and apply sound money management skills to protect him in
the future. I'm tired of kids winding up broke at the end of their
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen, you don't have to be Leigh Steinberg to come up with a
good deal. I didn't want Sam to sign one of those phony deals where
there was a big total but the player had little chance of seeing
the money at the end of the contract. I know based on a 20 percent
return, that Sam will have $20 million at the end of the contract
and he can make $42 million at the end of the contract.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal calls for Madison to earn a $385,000 base salary this
season, $2.7 million next year, $4.3 million in 2002 and then
salaries of $4.3 million, $5.3 million, $6.3 million, $6.7 million,
$7.015 million, and $7.4 million. This will likely be one of those
deals that is reworked after the third year because the cap number
will be too high. But even when it is, the new deal will come with
a new signing bonus and Burrough will recommend the same type of
deal.
</P>
<P>
   Burrough understands the management side of the game. He was the
general manager for the USFL Houston Gamblers and New Jersey
Generals and was instrumental in bringing Jim Kelly to the USFL. He
has seen athletes sign what he considers the ``most ridiculous''
deals over the years and get taken. He said he tried to structure
deals differently in the past, but ``I think I just made them too
complicated and they didn't work. When the Dolphins suggested I
come up with something different that would protect the team and
the player, I came up with the trust. It seems to work well for
both sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have done one of those stupid deals and gotten the big
numbers with big headlines, but those deals don't involve real
money. This is real money. Eight years from now, Sam will be a very
wealthy young man,'' said Burrough.
</P>
<P>
   Madison will be the second highest-paid cornerback in the league
behind Ty Law, but ``we weren't interested in making Sam the
highest paid cornerback. We wanted to make him the best paid
cornerback,'' Burrough said.
</P>
<P>
   This has apparently ensured that. As it has ensured Wayne
Huizenga that Madison's $11 million bonus will be invested well and
money will be there in case Madison decides to play a pickup
basketball game and permanently injures himself, ending his career.
</P>
<P>
   Is the deal unique?
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh-based agent Ralph Cindrich set up a ``Rabbi trust''
in 1985 for Bill Fralic, investing a certain amount of money that
would pay Fralic $150,000 the rest of his life. Other agents have
set up trusts and annuities for their clients, but this may be one
of the first deals in which the team actually has hands-on access
to the money.
</P>
<P>
   While some agents say the NFLPA will have no standing to object
to this type of arrangement, it could certainly put out an advisory
to agents that it frowns upon such deals and then discipline agents
who break the union's guidelines. The NFLPA has gotten tougher with
how its agents do business. It has gone after Tank Black for his
alleged role in bilking clients out of millions, and it has
suspended and fined other agents for breaking the rules.
</P>
<P>
   The final word has not been spoken on this unique arrangement,
hailed as innovative and exciting by some, dangerous by others.
</P>
<P>
   At least the Patriots didn't have to worry about Madison. They
took Chris Canty.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots are going to score a financial bonanza _ $80
million to $100 million _ when they offer their new stadium up for
naming rights whether it's Monster.com or Gillette or John Hancock
or Fleet. In cities such as Denver and Green Bay, where new
stadiums and renovations are in the works and where the public
outlay is far greater than in New England, the naming rights fee
will go directly back to the city and state. Might this be a
negotiable point in cities like Boston, where there's concern about
the public outlay? Obviously teams look forward to naming rights to
defer their own stadium costs, but if there's a sharing of those
naming fees it may be a gesture of goodwill by the team and, in
some cases, a deal-maker. Nonetheless, imagine a $295 million
renovation of Lambeau Field resulting in the remodeled facility
being known as the Oscar Mayer Bowl. The Packers have certainly
tried to put off the inevitable, but defraying costs to the
taxpayers is winning out . . . The next couple of years will be a
true indication of whether Bill Belichick made the right choice
during that terribly awkward press conference last winter when he
informed the world that he was resigning as coach of the New York
Jets. Citing reasons of uncertainty about the new ownership and the
many years of being under Bill Parcells's watch and thumb,
Belichick left and created a sticky mess that was ultimately
resolved by the Patriots giving up a No. 1 draft pick to the Jets
as compensation. The Jets went with Al Groh, who is also a terrific
defensive coach, and who is taking on basically what Pete Carroll
had to take on in New England _ replacing Parcells. The one
difference, and it's a huge one, is that Groh is taking over a team
following a disappointing 8-8 season, not after a team went to the
Super Bowl. He is taking over a team that had four No. 1 draft
picks, though granted, he did lose one of the best players in the
game, Keyshawn Johnson, to do so. The ownership was resolved in
what appears to be the best scenario possible _ Woody Johnson, like
Bob Kraft, is a lifelong fan of his team and one who has deep
pockets and can build a winner. What we'll find out in the next
couple of years is which team is better off. For the immediate
future, however, the Jets appear ahead of the game. Quarterback
Vinny Testaverde is returning from a nasty injury to his Achilles'
tendon, the Jets have a star running back in Curtis Martin, and
Parcells is still running the operation. On the negative side,
Belichick is gone and so are his innovative defenses . . . Eagles
owner Jeffrey Lurie is having the same problem with Philadelphia
that John Harrington and Kraft had in Boston. Lurie is willing to
fork up more than $300 million for a new facility in downtown
Philly as part of a two-stadium complex with the Phillies, but the
deal has gotten mired in all sorts of political mumbo-jumbo. Lurie,
a Newton native, has not yet threatened he'll leave Philly, but
that's sure to come soon . . . Speaking of stadium sites, the
Weymouth Naval Air Station would have been a great site for the
Patriots and we must wonder whether the Red Sox will ever consider
it if talks with Boston fall apart. With gobs of space and one of
the biggest malls in America in the works, it appears to be a
natural place for a ballpark and a hotel or two . . . The feel good
number of the week: Tampa Bay defensive tackle Warren Sapp shot a
108 at the NFL Cadillac Golf Classic.

   While the Redskins will pay their players more than $100 million
this season in pursuit of the Super Bowl (and still somehow stay
under the $62.2 million salary cap), they are about to undergo a
series of cuts, position by position, to whittle the numbers a tad.
The Redskins probably won't do a lot of earth-shattering things,
but look for a player or two of decent value to become available .
. . With 14 offensive linemen, the Patriots feel they're all set
and the likelihood that Armstrong will be a part of the team
appears slimmer. They must be seeing something the rest of us
don't. The Patriots, in fact, will likely need to cut some
candidates before training camp. Ed Ellis, who had so many problems
in Barcelona before being asked to leave, may be one of the
casualties . . . It is now clear that ``Monday Night Football'' is
scared to death of Vince McMahon and the WWF. The wrestling
organization has taken viewers away from MNF the past few years to
the point where the program suffered its lowest ratings ever last
season. When the ratings drop, the TV execs begin to do things that
look more and more like their successful competition. The WWF can
be funny, so now MNF will be funny with comedian Dennis Miller as
the third man in the booth. The WWF attracts male-dominated
audiences with young women, so MNF went from 46-year-old Lesley
Visser to 26-year-old Melissa Stark as a sideline reporter. It's
just not football at MNF anymore, but ``sports entertainment,'' a
concept that has made McMahon a very wealthy man . . . Former
Patriot Willie Clay is still waiting for a call to return to the
playing field. With a few teams, including the Patriots, in need of
an experienced free safety, he'll likely work soon. For now, Clay
is running his construction company in Atlanta while keeping in
shape for the call . . . Tony Agnone said client Sam Gash has
rejected offers to play for the Jets and Giants. ``Sam's back home
in North Carolina and he's going to sit and wait for a longer-term
spot. He doesn't want a deal where he's gone after a year. There
have been five or six teams (none of which are the Patriots)
interested all along and we'll wait and see. We know there will be
injuries and Sam might get a situation he likes then. If it comes
down to a one-year deal, then Sam will then make a decision based
on what he thinks would be right for him.'' . . . Former Patriots
running back/punt and kick returner Dave Meggett has been cleared
of all charges stemming from a Toronto hotel incident involving a
call girl. Meggett, who has retired from football, is mulling two
coaching possibilities _ as an assistant with the Jets as part of
the NFL coaches internship program, or as a voluntary assistant at
his alma mater, Towson State. Meggett has earned his degree from
Towson and is now pursuing a master's degree . . . Defensive tackle
Gabe Wilkins would have been a nice fit for the Patriots, but the
former 49er is having knee surgery that will force him to sit out
the season . . . Former Giants running back Gary Brown has two
offers on the table and is expected to decide soon whether to
accept one or retire . . . Angelo Wright, who represents Sean
Dawkins, said he has told both the Jets and the Packers, the two
front-runners for the wide receiver's services, to outline their
contractual game plan soon. ``We just want a situation where if
it's only a one-year deal that the team will enter into
negotiations during the season for a longer-term deal.'' After
losing Johnson, the Jets appear to have the greatest need for the
former Colt and Seahawk, who caught 58 passes last season . . .
Former Patriots and Dolphins quarterback Scott Zolak has received
calls from five teams and expects to be in someone's camp . . .
Jimmy Johnson is enjoying retirement in the Florida Keys. He has
been back to the mainland a few times since he announced his
retirement, once for a birthday party . . . Most football
executives took the week off, therefore there wasn't much activity
around the league, although the Tennessee Titans made it known
they'll be pursuing Reggie White this week. With Josh Evans
suspended by the league, the Titans have a need for a defensive
lineman, but why White, who retired and didn't play last year? The
Jaguars are already on record as saying they don't have an
interest, but that could change if the Tony Brackens contract
dispute gets uglier and Brackens decides to sit out . . . The NFLPA
is holding its rookie symposium Monday in San Diego, where it will
lecture players on drugs, sex, crime, life in the NFL, etc. These
are annual sessions, but given the enormous amount of trouble
players are getting into these days, the union is trying to get
tougher with its players on getting their act together and
listening to the message. One thing it did last week was send out
memos to agents asking them to continue to school their clients on
the importance of good citizenship.

<P>
   BOSTON _ About noon last Sunday, Bermuda Race watchers thought
the unlikely was about to occur _ a record in the 42d biennial
Newport-Bermuda Race.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh southwesterly winds _ pumping up on a weather system known
in the summer as a Bermuda high _ blew for two days and nights
between 17 and 25 knots, according to race spokesman Talbot Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Maxi boat Sayonara _ with Chris Dickson at the helm and a rock
star crew _ was just 121 miles from the finish at St. David's
Light, with George Coumantaros's Boomerang and James Dolan's
Sagamore just astern and within striking distance.
</P>
<P>
   At an average speed of 12.23 knots, Sayonara and the other two
Maxis were well ahead of the record pace for this bluewater classic
set in 1996 by Boomerang.
</P>
<P>
   But through the day Sunday, hearts were sinking as fast as the
anemometer needle. The Bermuda High _ sitting on top of the island
_ had snuffed out all but a trace breeze of less than 5 knots from
the north, and the only hope for a record finish was a low-pressure
system moving slowly off the Annapolis coast.
</P>
<P>
   Racers hoped the low might nudge the high pressure lock far
enough east to allow some fresh breeze in for a record finish.
Alas, no such luck for the Maxis, but the sudden wind drop from 16
knots to light vapors in the last 100 miles of the race set up a
great finish for one of the smallest and unlikeliest yachts in the
fleet.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Crawford from Maryland, sailing Restless _ his 35-year-old
Rhodes/Pearson 41, the highest handicap in the 176-boat fleet _ was
able to make up time as the leaders stalled. After the handicap
correction, Restless won the Bermuda Lighthouse Trophy as the
overall winner.
</P>
<P>
   What made Crawford's victory even sweeter was that a
family-owned fiberglass boat with a crew of old friends beat some
of the fastest carbon-fiber boats and top professional sailors in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   America's Cup sailors Dickson, Kenny Read, Peter Isler, Moose
McClintock, and Brad Butterworth were but a few of the star-studded
flotilla that left Newport midday Friday and kept up a torrid pace
across the Gulf Stream, only to have the wind stall out in the last
100 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Restless and skipper Crawford _ who inherited the
immaculate 35-year-old sloop from his inlaws 13 years ago _ were
blind-luck winners. For the first 24 hours, Restless covered 208
miles for an average speed of 8.6 knots.
</P>
<P>
   But Crawford _ a lifelong sailor who has made a circumnavigation
of the world by sail _ made several correct calls, positioning
Restless well enough in the Gulf Stream to take advantage of the
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   As the wind died among the leaders, Restless used the current to
continue moving ahead and, as one of the smallest and unlikeliest
boats in the fleet, she was close enough to win the overall trophy
on corrected time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a good handicap,'' said Crawford at the docks of the
Royal Bermuda Yacht Squadron in Hamilton Tuesday, ``but I would
like to think this win came down to the skill of my crew.''
</P>
<P>
   Line honors were also a bit of a surprise, as Sagamore ghosted
ahead of leader Sayonara Monday night to cross the St. David's
Lighthouse line on Day 3 in 23 hours 2 minutes 39 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Sayonara finished 13 minutes back, with Blue Yankee third (Day
3, 23 hours 53 minutes 44 seconds). Course record-holder Boomerang
_ skippered by the 83-year-old Coumantaros in his 50th year of
yacht racing, came in fourth overall. It finished on Day 4 at 00
hours 3 minutes 59 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   About 8 in the evening light, sailors aboard Sayonara reported
they were about 45 miles from St. David Light and that the sea had
become ``mirror calm'' around them.
</P>
<P>
   The first of the cruiser fleet to cross the line was Zaraffa
owned and sailed by Skip Sheldon from Shelburne, Vt., who took the
gun on Day 4 at 00 hours 30 minutes 37 seconds, beating out Trader
_ sailed by Fred Detwiler from Grosse Point, Mich., by about 20
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In America's Cup developments, billionaire Craig McCaw
formalized his intention to back the OneWorld Challenge Syndicate,
one of two Seattle-based Cup challenges in a city that has never
sailed in the event.
</P>
<P>
   Though the formation of the syndicate has not been a well-kept
secret, McCaw formally announced his entrance into the 2002 Cup at
a luncheon at Seattle Yacht Club in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   With a budget reported around $75 million, McCaw continues the
trend of the America's Cup being taken over by wealthy backers who
need little corporate sponsorship. This is actually a throwback to
the Cup's early days when names like Vanderbilt, Lipton, Adams, and
Sopwith dominated sailing's ultimate event. It was rekindled by
modern barons such as Alan Bond, Michael Fay, and Bill Koch, though
corporate fund-raising has been increasingly part of the Cup scene
for many less-well-heeled competitors. At age 50, McCaw is founder
of the satellite communications company, Teledesic, and is listed
among the world's wealthiest individuals.
</P>
<P>
   McCaw's OneWorld Challenge also continues the plunder of New
Zealand's two-time winning team, which, at the end of the 2000 Cup
in Auckland, New Zealand, appeared unbeatable and perhaps a
favorite for several Cups in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Kiwi designer Laurie Davidson will head the OneWorld design
team, and Australian Peter Gilmour, who skippered for Japan in the
last Cup, will be director of sailing.
</P>
<P>
   Six other members of OneWorld are former Team New Zealand
members, including Richard Dodson, Matthew Mason, Craig Monk,
Jeremy Scantlebury, Andrew Taylor, and Pete Weymouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The America's Cup is a race that has been run with sailors
from throughout the world since the turn of the century,'' says Bob
Ratliffe, spokesman for OneWorld, putting forth the syndicate's
official line.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, another Seattle challenge has formed under the
Corinthian Yacht Club burgee, headed by Russell Belden. Called the
Seattle Challenge, Belden originally sought sponsorship from the
Seattle Yacht Club, though he is not a member. When the club failed
to commit to Belden, the Seattle Challenge joined forces with the
Corinthian Yacht Club. ``Seattle is a world-class city, very
capable of supporting two strong syndicates,'' Belden said.

INEXPLICABLE'S NOSE MAKES IT 
</HEADLINE>
 SWEEPSTAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALEM, N.H. _ When the field is full of speed horses, it pays to
be patient.
</P>
<P>
   Jockey Jose Santos proved that Saturday, as he sat behind a hot
pace, then drove Inexplicable up from the middle of the pack to nip
Where's Taylor by a nose and win the 21st running of the $200,000
New Hampshire Sweepstakes at Rockingham Park.
</P>
<P>
   The race was marred when Haami, the 9-5 choice, apparently
fractured his left front knee approaching the far turn, was pulled
up by rider Robbie Davis, and taken from the track in a van. Haami
was eating, and being iced after the race, and the injury is not
considered life-threatening. However, his racing career is probably
over.
</P>
<P>
   ``The race went perfect for me,'' said Santos, who won the
Sweeps aboard Fourstars Allstar in 1993 and Statesmanship in '98.
``When that horse broke down on the backstretch, I got my horse in
pretty good position. But the horse in front of me (Where's Taylor)
kept on going in the stretch. My horse is a very nice horse. I
didn't know I'd won untill the announcer said my number. I thought
my horse felt very strong, but I never thought we'd set a track
record.''
</P>
<P>
   Inexplicable, the fourth choice at 7-2 ($9.80 to win), covered
the ``about'' distance of 1 1/8 miles over the extremely firm turf
course in 1:45, breaking the mark of 1:45 3/5 set by Kiri's Clown
in 1995. Distant Mirage and Aaron Gryder checked in a well-beaten
third, but this was a classic two-horse battle.
</P>
<P>
   Where's Taylor, who began his career at Rock, stalked the pace
and took over with a big move. It appeared the 5-2 second choice,
trained by Michael Stidham and based at Arlington Park, would draw
away, until Inexplicable came roaring up on the outside. Where's
Taylor battled to the wire, but simply lost the bob as the pair
flashed under the wire.
</P>
<P>
   ``The race set up good for him,'' said C. J. Lanerie, who rode
Where's Taylor. ``When the horse broke down, everybody checked, and
he got a lead on the turn. We just got caught in the stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   From the powerful New York stable of trainer Christophe Clement,
Inexplicable, a son of Miswaki, out of a Nureyev mare, is a
5-year-old who has run only 13 times. For the first seven races of
his career, he was a dirt sprinter, running in top company. But he
became a stakes horse when Clement switched him to the turf and
sent him long.
</P>
<P>
   ``He finished very well,'' said Nicholas Bachalard, assistant to
Clement. ``There was a lot of speed in the race, and Jose kept him
off the pace. He just got up in time. This was his stakes debut. We
had hopes for him on the dirt, but we decided to switch him to the
grass. He's better on turf. We were concerned about the distance,
but he handled it well. We've had quite a few problems with him,
little ones, which is why we're still running him at age 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no current plans for him, but there are a lot of races
around. He's been doing very well. He's a very good horse, and a
very happy horse. He's sound. Santos rode a good race. He came on
at the right time.''
</P>
<P>
   The injury to Haami was most unfortunate. A 5-year-old owned by
the Shadwell Stable of Sheikh Hamdan, the Minister of Finance of
Dubai, Haami deserved the role of favorite off his fine record in
both Europe and the United States. He was headstrong, pulling Davis
up on the outside, and was laying second to frontruner Johnny
Dollar (who faded to sixth in the 10-horse field), when the injury
occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took a few bad steps, and jumped a little,'' said Davis.
``He went another 10 or 12 strides, but he had nothing. I eased up
on him, and I think he fractured something.''
</P>
<P>
   Distant Mirage won the Old Ironsides Stakes at Suffolk Downs
June 3, but this was a much tougher spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had an eventful trip,'' said Gryder. ``We got squeezed at
the first turn, but we got behind the speed. Then he settled in and
ran a real good race.''
