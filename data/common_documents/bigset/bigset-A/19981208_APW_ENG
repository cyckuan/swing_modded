	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Prime Minister John Howard lauded
Italy's contribution to Australian heritage as the national capital
played host Tuesday to Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro.
	   Howard listed Victorian Governor Sir James Gobbo, rugby union
star David Campese, fashion designer Carla Zampatti and the late
Democratic Labor Party figure Bob Santamaria among
Italian-Australians to make significant contributions in Australia
since World War II.
	   ``Australians of Italian background comprise of course the
longest non-English speaking tributary to the modern Australian
heritage,'' he told a lunch honoring Scalfaro.
	   ``More than a million Australians claim an Italian heritage and
they do it with great pride and great passion.'' Australia's total
population is about 18 million.
	   Howard said Italians reinforced Australian support for family
values.
	   ``It is impossible to conceive the story of post-war Australia
without the Italian contribution and the Italian way playing a
very, very important part in that story,'' he said. ``It has made
Australia a better country.''
	   The prime minister said he had been heavily influenced by
Italian culture and values while on a working holiday in Italy in
1964.
	   Opposition leader Kim Beazley spoke of Italy's important role
within the European Union and Scalfaro's enduring part in more than
half a century of Italian political life.
	   Beazley said the Italian republic had remained remarkably stable
despite 50 years of continual change in Italian governments.
	   He also noted that an Italian in 1967 had been the first
European head of state to visit Australia.
	   ``That says worlds of course about the contribution of the
Italian community and the significance of Italy to us,'' Beazley
said.
	   Scalfaro delivered an enthusiastic reply: ``I say
congratulations Italians who have been a symbol of Italy, I thank
you on behalf of the nation,'' he said in tribute to Australians of
Italian descent.
	   ``Our thanks to all the Australian people, for welcoming in
various years the Italians in this country and giving them the
opportunity of feeling at home with equal opportunities.''

	   TAMPA, Florida (AP) _ Trent Dilfer finally got the best of Brett
Favre and carried the rejuvenated Tampa Bay Buccaneers back into
the playoff race.
	   Dilfer threw long touchdown passes to Jacquez Green and Bert
Emanuel and the Bucs broke a six-game losing streak against Green
Bay with a 24-22 victory over the Packers Monday night.
	   Favre, losing for only the second time in 15 career starts
against Tampa Bay, was sacked eight times and lost one of his six
fumbles as Green Bay (8-5) missed an opportunity to clinch a
wild-card playoff berth.
	   Meanwhile, the Bucs (6-7) brightened their postseason prospects
by climbing into a tie with New Orleans and Arizona for the final
NFC wild-card spot with three weeks left in the regular season.
	   Green and Emanuel, questionable for the game after aggravating a
sprained left ankle in practice, scored on the same slant pattern
in the second quarter.
	   Dilfer hit Green in stride crossing the field from the left on a
64-yard scoring play, then found Emanuel crossing from the right
for a 62-yard TD that gave the Bucs a 14-3 lead.
	   Playing at home for the first time since 1983 on Monday night,
Tampa Bay looked like it might be on the verge of letting the game
slip away when Favre threw a 4-yard TD pass to Mark Chmura to trim
Green Bay's deficit to 17-15 on the second play of the fourth
quarter.
	   But Derrick Mayes dropped Favre's two-point conversion pass, and
the Bucs drove 52 yards after a Mayes fumble on the next Packers
possession to put the game out of reach on Dilfer's 6-yard TD run
with 6:01 to go.
	   Favre rallied the Packers again, throwing a 1-yard scoring pass
to Chmura to pull within two with 2:24 left. But that was as close
as Green Bay would get.

Small plane crashes in St. Lawrence River, at least five killed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES condition of survivors; ADDS details on rescue;
CORRECTS that plane was carrying two pilots and eight passengers.

<TEXT>
	   BAIE-COMEAU, Quebec (AP) _ A twin-engine plane with 10 people
aboard crashed in frigid waters near the mouth of the St. Lawrence
River. Three people were rescued, and five bodies were found in the
wreckage by military divers.
	   The other two people were missing; authorities said Monday their
bodies may have drifted downstream.
	   The three survivors were found clinging to the tail of the plane
and spent about an hour in the freezing water before being rescued
by a civilian helicopter, which took them to the Baie-Comeau
hospital. They were suffering from hypothermia, fractures to the
spine, and shock, but their injuries were not considered
life-threatening. The three men were later transferred to Quebec
City for further treatment.
	   The plane, a Britten-Norman Islander operated by a regional
company called Air Satellite, came to rest in shallow water, with
only its tail sticking above the surface. A rising tide later
covered the tail.
	   Authorities said the plane was carrying two pilots and eight
passengers. A coast guard vessel and rescue aircraft were sent to
the scene.
	   The plane went down about a mile from Baie-Comeau, on the north
shore of the St. Lawrence about 180 miles (290 kilometers)
northeast of Quebec City.
	   There was no immediate indication what caused the crash, which
was witnessed by people on shore, but it had been snowing before
the plane took off.
	   The region was hit by freezing rain overnight Sunday and there
was speculation that ice on the wings may have played a part in the
crash. Neither police nor other officials would comment on the
speculation.
	   The regional search-and-rescue center in Nova Scotia said it was
not aware of any emergency radio calls from the pilot prior to the
crash.
	   Richard Gagne, a Quebec provincial police spokesman, said the
plane crashed shortly after taking off from Baie-Comeau en route to
Rimouksi, on the south side of the river. The St. Lawrence is about
30 miles (48 kilometers) wide at Baie-Comeau.

Elderly jade hawker sets himself afire in court
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ An elderly man pleaded guilty and didn't
complain about being fined for illegally selling jade trinkets. But
when a magistrate refused to hand back the confiscated merchandise
he set himself on fire in the courtroom.
	   Wong Tai-fuk, 76, described by his wife as a jade lover who sold
the objects mainly to pass the time with other hobbyists, was in
critical condition Tuesday in Hong Kong's Queen Mary Hospital,
according to government spokeswoman Iris Au.
	   One day earlier, Wong turned himself into a human fireball
inside Magistrate James Tam's courtroom.
	   Wong appeared in court and pleaded guilty to charges he was
selling the jade on a sidewalk without getting a hawker's license.
He said nothing about the fine of 400 Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
50).
	   But when Wong asked for the return of his jade objects, worth
some 20,000 Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 2,560), Tam turned him
down, saying it was standard legal procedure for authorities to
keep such confiscated goods.
	   Wong responded by walking to the back row of seats in the
courtroom, where he took out a plastic bottle and doused himself
with a flammable liquid.
	   Police rushed toward him, but Wong told them: ``Don't come any
closer,'' according to an account in the South China Morning Post.
	   The newspaper quoted a police officer who witnessed the event as
saying Wong ``then lit himself and became a fireball. Then he
walked towards the courtroom door.''
	   A police officer quickly put out the flames with a fire
extinguisher, the Post said, but Wong had already suffered serious
burns all over his body.
	   Wong's wife later told police he only sold the ornaments to help
pass the time and meet other jade lovers, the Post reported.
	   One of his regular customers, a 60-year-old woman identified
only by the surname Sum, described Wong as a friendly person who
enjoyed gambling on horse races in addition to jade.
	   ``He didn't even grumble when he was arrested,'' Sum told the
Post. She said Wong was selling the trinkets for prices ranging
from 30 Hong Kong dollars (about U.S. dlrs 4) to a few hundred Hong
Kong dollars (less than U.S. dlrs 100).

Record Australian cocaine haul
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Identifies boat captain in 2nd graf. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Four people charged over the
importation of Australia's biggest cocaine haul -- 495 pounds (225
kilos) seized from a yacht -- appeared in court Tuesday and were
jailed pending trial.
	   They were Robert Scott Flavel, 28, of Florida; Beatriz
Gonzalez-Betes Suarez, 38, of Spain; Jose Manuel Campillo Vaquere,
34, of Adelaide; and Gregory Paul Meggett, 28, of South Africa, the
boat's captain
	   The four appeared in Coffs Harbor Local Court following the
seizure of 495 pounds (225 kilos) of cocaine from a yacht off Coffs
Harbor on Monday. All were charged with importing cocaine and
ordered to reappear in court Monday.
	   A police spokesman said it was believed the ketch Maeva,
carrying cocaine with an estimated street value of 50 million
Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 30 million), had started its journey
in South America.
	   The drugs seized Monday afternoon had been stored in a dinghy
attached to the vessel, the police spokesman said, adding the bust
followed a six-month undercover operation.
	   It comes two months after federal police, customs and the navy
smashed an
	   international drug ring and recorded Australia's largest ever
drug haul.
	   On October 14, during a pre-dawn raid on a beach on the New
South Wales mid-north coast, south of Port Macquarie, 880 pounds
(400 kilos) of high-grade heroin was seized.

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Four people charged over the
importation of Australia's biggest cocaine haul _ 495 pounds (225
kilos) seized from a yacht _ appeared in court Tuesday and were
jailed pending trial.
	   The four were Robert Scott Flavel, 28, of the state of Florida
in the United States; Beatriz Gonzalez-Betes Suarez, 38, of Spain;
Jose Manuel Campillo Vaquere, 34, of Adelaide, Australia; and
Gregory Paul Meggett, 28, of South Africa, the boat's captain.
	   They appeared in Coffs Harbor Local Court following the seizure
of 495 pounds (225 kilos) of cocaine from a yacht off Coffs Harbor
on Monday. All were charged with importing cocaine and ordered to
reappear in court Monday.
	   A police spokesman said it was believed the ketch Maeva,
carrying cocaine with an estimated street value of 50 million
Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 30 million), had started its journey
in South America.
	   The drugs seized Monday afternoon had been stored in a dinghy
attached to the vessel, the police spokesman said, adding the bust
followed a six-month undercover operation.
	   It comes two months after federal police, customs and the navy
smashed an international drug ring and recorded Australia's largest
ever drug haul.
	   On October 14, during a pre-dawn raid on a beach on the New
South Wales mid-north coast, south of Port Macquarie, 880 pounds
(400 kilos) of high-grade heroin was seized.
	   Eighteen people, including seven Hong Kong Chinese nationals and
11 Indonesians, were arrested.
	   The previous record cocaine haul was in 1994 when 383 pounds
(174 kilos) were found in the northern Sydney suburb of Artarmon.

Cyclone Thelma moves slightly away from Darwin
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DARWIN, Australia (AP) _ Cyclone Thelma, packing winds of 150
mph (240 kph) at its center, moved slowly away from Darwin, the
Bureau of Meteorology reported Tuesday afternoon.
	   The Bureau said at last report Thelma -- as intense as Cyclone
Tracy that destroyed Darwin in 1974 -- was about 100 miles (165 km)
northwest of Darwin over the Arafura Sea.
	   In the three hours to 2 p.m. Tuesday, the category four cyclone
had moved 15 miles (25 km) southwest toward Western Australia.
	   Thelma was moving parallel with the Northern Territory coast and
only its outer edge was affecting Darwin, the bureau said.
	   The ``very destructive core'' of the cyclone was just offshore
of the western end of Bathurst Island unleashing winds registering
105 mph (170 kph) there and on the other Tiwi island, Melville.
	   The Bureau said destructive wind gusts were no longer expected
in Darwin.

Philippine Airlines trying to revive talks with Cathay Pacific
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Ailing Philippine Airlines is trying
to revive talks with prospective investor Cathay Pacific Airways, a
PAL official said Tuesday.
	   If Cathay Pacific is unwilling to restart the talks, PAL will
consider investment offers from other foreign airlines, PAL
executive vice president Manolo Aquino said.
	   Cathay Pacific officials were not immediately available for
comment. The airline backed out of negotiations for a possible
controlling stake in the Philippine flag carrier last week.
	   PAL closed for nearly two weeks on Sept. 23 following labor
disputes and mounting losses worsened by Asia's financial crisis.
It then began negotiations with Cathay Pacific, before the Hong
Kong carrier announced it was pulling out of the talks.
	   Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu said the companies disagreed
over management control of PAL and the timing of Cathay Pacific's
capital infusion into the Philippine carrier.
	   Cathay Pacific wanted full management control of PAL but the
companies were unable to agree on how to deal with a constitutional
prohibition of foreigners controlling key industries in the
Philippines.
	   Cathay Pacific also refused to put its money into PAL until
after a PAL rehabilitation plan is approved by creditors and
Manila's corporate watchdog, the Securities and Exchange
Commission, Espiritu said.
	   PAL submitted the plan to the SEC on Monday. It calls for an
injection of dlrs 150 million in new capital, a work force
reduction, fleet downsizing, and abandonment of unprofitable
routes.
	   The plan must be approved by the SEC and the airline's local and
foreign creditors, to whom it owes dlrs 2.1 billion.
	   If the proposed rehabilitation plan is approved, local
investors, including PAL chairman and chief stockholder Lucio Tan,
will invest dlrs 90 million of the dlrs 150 million needed by the
airline, PAL said.
	   The rest would be provided within six months by a still
undetermined ``strategic partner,'' the airline said.

Pregnant Spice Girls tell Prince Charles how they are doing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prince Charles met up with Spice Girls at the 77th
Royal Variety Performance, and quizzed the two pregnant band
members about when they are due and how they are coping.
	   ''Have you been doing lots of exercise,'' the prince, Queen
Elizabeth II's oldest son, asked Posh Spice, Victoria Adams on
Monday. Her baby is due in February.
	   Scary Spice, Mel B, responded, ''Yeah, this'' as she mimed
eating. Mel B's baby is also due next year.
	   The four-member Spice Girls performed their song, ''Goodbye,''
for the show at the Lyceum theater in London. They did the
performance sitting down so the pregnant Spices wouldn't have to
dance.
	   The fundraising extravaganza was to benefit the Entertainment
Artistes' Benevolent Fund.

Prime minister pays tribute to Australian Italians
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos available

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Prime Minister John Howard lauded
Italy's contribution to Australian heritage as the national capital
played host Tuesday to Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro.
	   Howard listed Victorian Governor Sir James Gobbo, rugby union
star David Campese, fashion designer Carla Zampatti and the late
Democratic Labor Party figure Bob Santamaria among
Italian-Australians to make significant contributions in Australia
since World War II.
	   ``Australians of Italian background comprise of course the
longest non-English speaking tributary to the modern Australian
heritage,'' he told a lunch honoring Scalfaro.
	   ``More than a million Australians claim an Italian heritage and
they do it with great pride and great passion,'' Howard said.
Australia's total population is about 18 million.
	   Howard said Italians reinforced Australian support for family
values.
	   ``It is impossible to conceive the story of post-war Australia
without the Italian contribution and the Italian way playing a
very, very important part in that story,'' he said. ``It has made
Australia a better country.''
	   The prime minister said he had been heavily influenced by
Italian culture and values while on a working holiday in Italy in
1964.
	   Opposition leader Kim Beazley spoke of Italy's important role
within the European Union and Scalfaro's enduring part in more than
half a century of Italian political life.
	   Beazley said the Italian republic had remained remarkably stable
despite 50 years of continual change in Italian governments.
	   He also noted that an Italian in 1967 had been the first
European head of state to visit Australia.
	   ``That says worlds of course about the contribution of the
Italian community and the significance of Italy to us,'' Beazley
said.
	   Scalfaro delivered an enthusiastic reply: ``I say
congratulations Italians who have been a symbol of Italy, I thank
you on behalf of the nation,'' he said in tribute to Australians of
Italian descent.
	   ``Our thanks to all the Australian people, for welcoming in
various years the Italians in this country and giving them the
opportunity of feeling at home with equal opportunities.''

Rangers rout Maple Leafs 6-2
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with late game &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Goalie Mike Richter and the New York Rangers
continued their turnaround after a slow start, beating the Toronto
Maple Leafs 6-2 Monday night in a battle of two of the National
Hockey League's hottest teams.
	   Richter made 24 saves as he extended his personal unbeaten
streak and the Rangers' team streak to six (5-0-1). In winning
their fifth straight, the Rangers climbed over the .500 mark for
the first time this season at 10-9-7 after an 0-4 start.
	   Mike Knuble, Todd Harvey, Niklas Sundstrom, Brian Leetch, Peter
Nedved and John MacLean scored for New York, which extended its
unbeaten streak against the Maple Leafs to 10 games (9-0-1).
Toronto hasn't beaten New York since Jan. 3, 1993 and hasn't won in
Madison Square Garden since Dec. 19, 1990, a stretch of seven games
(0-6-1).
	   Frederik Modin and Sergei Berezin scored for the Maple Leafs,
who had won three straight and six of their previous seven and were
tied for the second-best record in the league.
 &UR; Stars 3, Flames 2
	   In Calgary, Alberta, Mike Modano scored once to spark a
three-goal second period and missed on a penalty shot as the Dallas
Stars defeated the Calgary Flames 3-2 Monday night.
	   Brian Skrudland and Sergei Zubov also scored for the Stars
(15-5-3).
	   Ed Ward and Jason Weimer replied for the Flames (9-15-2), who
have lost seven of their last nine games.
	   Roman Turek, getting a rare start, made 23 saves for Dallas and
remained unbeaten (3-0-2) in five starts.
	   Ward opened the scoring 14:53 into the game when Calgary
capitalized on a sloppy Dallas line change. Confusion at the Stars'
bench allowed three Flames to swoop in alone from the blue-line and
Steve Smith fed a perfect pass to Ward at the far post for an easy
tip-in.
	   Modano tied the game with his eighth of the season at 1:51 of
the second period on a power play.
	   Skrudland gave Dallas a 2-1 lead at 13:59 of the second period
with his second goal of the season and second in as many games.

Most Russians no longer worry about whether Yeltsin stays or goes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; An AP News Analysis &QL; 
 &UR; By BARRY RENFREW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin has made yet another surreal,
unconvincing attempt to show Russia and the rest of the world there
is nothing wrong with him.
	   Yeltsin left the hospital Monday and went to the Kremlin for
three hours to dismiss aides who said what everyone knew _ the
president has health problems. Never mind that they also said
Yeltsin would and should stay in office.
	   While the rest of the world worries about Yeltsin's health, most
Russians don't seem to care. It's just not big news anymore.
	   If Yeltsin were to resign early or die in office, there would
almost certainly be presidential elections, as the constitution
stipulates.
	   Many Russians would welcome elections, saying the country needs
a strong, effective leader to tackle its problems.
	   But with Russia in the grip of the worst economic crisis since
the fall of the Soviet Union, most political leaders and aspiring
presidential candidates prefer that Yeltsin stay in power for now
and take the blame.
	   Nobody has any real idea of how to tackle Russia's enormous
problems.
	   The economy is stuck between the old-Soviet system and failed
market reforms; the government's economic ministers don't know what
to do beyond begging for Western aid, even though billions have
already been wasted or stolen.
	   Even the Communists, the president's fiercest opponents, don't
seem keen to have their favorite target actually leave office any
time soon.
	   Top Communist leaders too have few solutions, and little
confidence that the electorate will back them.
	   The liberal reformers, who have backed Yeltsin in the past, are
deeply divided. Discredited by the failure of market reforms, they
can't agree on a presidential candidate.
	   The top two presidential candidates have problems of their own.
	   Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, who has the most powerful political
machine, is struggling to build support in the provinces, where
distrust of Moscow is strong and a major obstacle to his ambitions.
	   Nationalist leader Alexander Lebed constantly calls for
Yeltsin's removal, but still lacks the money and allies vital to
win the presidency.
	   Yeltsin has no idea of how to fix Russia's problems either. His
sole concern is clinging to power and telling everyone that he's in
charge, even if he stopped pretending long ago that he has any
solutions.
	   An ailing president who tries to rule from a hospital, some
Russians quip, is appropriate for a nation that is disintegrating.

Indonesian student protesters target attorney general's office
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: One name for Suharto is correct &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Hundreds of chanting student
protesters converged Tuesday on the attorney general's office to
press their demand that former President Suharto be put on trial.
	   Suharto, who quit in May amid political turmoil and civil
unrest, is scheduled to appear Wednesday for questioning at the
office of Attorney General Andi Mohammad Ghalib.
	   However, students who helped oust Suharto say the government of
his successor and onetime protege, President B.J. Habibie, is not
serious about investigating corruption allegations against the
former authoritarian leader.
	   And a newspaper reported Tuesday that widespread corruption
persists in the government.
	   ``Hang Suharto,'' shouted 500 students who arrived in buses at
Ghalib's office, a frequent target of protests in recent weeks.
Many protesters wore red and green university jackets. Security was
light.
	   Inside, prosecutors questioned Tunky Ariwibowo, a former trade
and industry minister who has been accused of providing perks that
enriched the business empires of Suharto's children.
	   Tunky was questioned about his role in a so-called ``national
car'' project, through which Suharto's son, Hutomo Mandala Putra,
was licensed to import cars from South Korea's Kia Motors Corp.
without having to pay import tariffs.
	   Habibie, a former research and technology minister, has pledged
to fight government graft that thrived during the rule of Suharto,
whose wealth was estimated by Forbes magazine at dlrs 4 billion.
	   But critics say Habibie, whose family owns dozens of businesses,
is too compromised by his links to the old regime to wipe out the
corruption that contributed to Indonesia's economic crisis.
	   Ghalib questioned Suharto several months ago during an earlier
investigation that failed to find any evidence against the former
president. Students said it was a whitewash.
	   The Southeast Asian nation of 202 million people is beset by
high unemployment and inflation, as well as sporadic riots and
student protests for swifter political reforms.
	   The Jakarta Post reported that corrupt practices have cost the
country 1.7 trillion rupiah (dlrs 225 million) in lost revenues
since Habibie took office.
	   The losses, which spanned from May to September this year, came
primarily from the departments of mines and energy, public works,
culture and education and transportation.
	   The Post cited Soedarjono, head of the government's internal
audit department, as saying the losses were determined from
investigating 8,435 development projects.

Thorpe heads home after back injury
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Leading English batsman Graham
Thorpe returned home on Tuesday after re-injuring his back in a
tour match against Victoria at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.
	   The 29-year-old topped England's run scoring in the past two
Ashes series
	   and was averaging 87.6 on this tour before injury.
	   ``It's probably the biggest series England players get to play
in, an Ashes series, and one I have enjoyed playing in the past,''
he said.
	   ``Naturally it's a big disappointment not be able to take any
further part
	   in the series. You want to play your part in getting your team
back into the series but at the same time you have to accept that
when your time is up, it's up.''
	   Team manager Graham Gooch said the England hierarchy met Monday
night when it was decided to send Thorpe home.
	   ``It's thought if Graham can't prove his fitness it is best that
he returns home . . . to get it sorted out once and for all,''
Gooch said.
	   He said a replacement player would not be sought.
	   Australia leads the five-test series 1-0 entering the third test
in Adelaide starting on Friday. (djp)

	   wickets but it was not enough to prevent a draw in the four-day
cricket match against Victoria state on Tuesday.
	   Chasing 281 runs to win, Victoria was 245-8 at stumps on the
final day at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.
	   England appeared on track for victory but lost focus when
Victorian tailender Ashley Gilbert raised tempers late in the day.
	   Gilbert, making his first-class debut, was involved in an
exchange with England paceman Dean Headley that prompted Mark
Ramprakash to walk from point to the toes of the tall Australian.
	   Umpire Terry Prue and England captain Alec Stewart separated the
duo, who were also involved in a verbal confrontation Monday when
Gilbert claimed Ramprakash's wicket.
	   Gilbert frustrated the victory bid with wicketkeeper Peter Roach
after the home side plummeted to 232-8 with 30 minutes remaining.
	   The duo then batted the remaining minutes for a draw. (djp)

Japan's steel industry slams U.S. anti-dumping probe
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese steelmakers on Tuesday slammed the
handling of a U.S. government investigation over Japan's alleged
dumping of steel products, saying they were given unfair treatment.
	   The Japan Iron and Steel Federation and the Japan Iron and Steel
Exporters' Association said in a statement the investigation was
politicized and that Japan has not been given a chance to make its
case.
	   ``We are increasingly concerned that the unprecedented
procedures taken by the Commerce Department in the anti-dumping
investigation on hot-rolled steel from Japan will deprive the
Japanese industry of a fair hearing,'' the statement said.
	   Last month, the U.S. Commerce Department ruled there was
evidence that a surge of steel imports from Japan and Russia had
created ``critical circumstances'' for the U.S. industry.
	   This means Japanese and Russian steel makers could face
retroactive dumping duties if they are found to have actually
dumped steel. The department's preliminary decision on whether
dumping occurred is expected in mid-February.
	   In Tuesday's statement, the Japanese industry called last
month's ruling ``substantially unjustified and procedurally
unprecedented.''
	   They also charged that the department ruling was illegal because
it was entirely based on the complaints of U.S. companies and
secret contacts with them.
	   ``Such actions cause us to question whether the department is
truly interested in conducting a fair inquiry,'' the statement
read. ``We are disturbed ... that the Commerce Department is not
conducting a fair, open hearing of the allegations against us.''
	   The statement urged the Commerce Department to re-examine its
procedures and reaffirm its intention to comply with U.S. law and
rules of the World Trade Organization.

Nicklaus sees benefit in playing Down Under
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DENNIS PASSA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ With seven Australian golfers
preparing to play on the U.S. PGA tour next season, it might be
suggested the sport doesn't need a boost Down Under.
	   But with the Presidents Cup, being played outside the United
States this week for the first time at Royal Melbourne, it will get
just that.
	   Jack Nicklaus, captain of the U.S. team and who played up to 30
tournaments in Australia during his career, feels it's
well-deserved timing that will also benefit golf around the world.
	   ``You have a lot of good players who come from this part of the
world, and to have the opportunity to see the other players is a
big event for Australia,'' Nicklaus said Tuesday.
	   ``I think that the game of golf and Australian golf, too, are
going to be the winners, that's the important part.''
	   Nicklaus agreed with earlier comments by International captain
Peter Thomson, a five-time British Open winner from Australia, that
Royal Melbourne will not be a ``home'' course for the International
side.
	   ``I really don't think that where you play makes a whole lot of
difference,'' said Nicklaus. ``I don't think it's really that big
of an issue.''
	   Next year, regular PGA tour players Greg Norman, Steve
Elkington, Stuart Appleby, Craig Parry and Brad Hughes will be
joined by new Australian Open champion Greg Chalmers and Robert
Allenby.
	   After Chalmers' Australian Open win, Appleby paid tribute to
Chalmers and the vanguard of new Australian talent.
	   Florida-based Appleby, who will play for the International team
beginning Friday, said Chalmers' future was unlimited.
	   ``This is just the start of things to come for him and for
Australian golf, especially those players playing overseas and
especially in the U.S.,'' said Appleby, 27.
	   ``I suppose I was the start of the young guys and I'll be the
old guy soon.
	   ``There will be half a dozen to a dozen guys playing the U.S.
tour in the
	   next 15 years from Australia, and all starting in their 20s,''
he said. (djp)

Witness described illegal sex to prime minister
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with Anwar's lawyers threatening to
launch perjury proceedings against key prosecution witness &QL; 
 &UR; By ALVIN UNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Before firing his deputy for
immorality, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad called in a man who
alleged he was sodomized by Anwar Ibrahim, a trial court was told
Tuesday.
	   Azizan Abu Bakar testified at Anwar's corruption and sexual
misconduct trial that police asked him to go to Mahathir's Kuala
Lumpur residence late at night for a meeting which lasted more than
one hour.
	   But as the testimony continued, defense lawyers threatened to
launch proceedings against Azizan for allegedly lying about Anwar's
illegal sex acts.
	   ``The police told me that the prime minister wanted to know the
true story,'' said Azizan, a former employee of Anwar who alleged
the then-deputy prime minister repeatedly forced him into sodomy, a
crime in this predominantly Muslim nation.
	   The witness said he had told Mahathir during the Aug. 24 meeting
that the allegations against Anwar were true.
	   Anwar is on trial on four counts of abuse of power, and will be
tried later on another charge of corruption and five charges of
committing illegal sex acts.
	   He has denied any wrongdoing, calling the charges part of a
high-level conspiracy to ruin his political career.
	   Mahathir fired Anwar on Sept. 2, saying he had determined Anwar
was morally unfit for office. The sacking led to demands for
political reforms and massive anti-government protests in the
normally placid Southeast Asian capital.
	   Soon after Anwar was dismissed, Mahathir told reporters he had
personally spoken to many people with whom Anwar was alleged to
have had illegal sex so that he could gauge the accusations for
himself.
	   But he had not disclosed details of such meetings.
	   Azizan, a former driver for Anwar's wife, startled the court
Monday by agreeing with a defense lawyer who said Anwar had never
sodomized him.
	   But as the cross-examination continued Tuesday defense lawyers
did not press him on the retraction.
	   It was not clear whether Azizan had gone back on his testimony
or he had simply misunderstood the defense lawyer's question.
	   On Tuesday, a defense lawyer said he was going to ask the court
to disregard Azizan's entire testimony on grounds that he was
telling lies.
	   ``We wish to institute impeachment proceedings against Azizan,''
Gurbachan Singh, the lawyer, told trial judge Augustine Paul.
	   If impeachment proceedings are permitted, the defense team is
expected to bring its own witnesses to testify against Azizan in an
attempt to prove he is lying about being sodomized by Anwar.
	   Azizan had accused Anwar of forcing him into sodomy in 1992. He
told the court last week that shame and guilt kept him from making
Anwar's repeated homosexual acts public until 1997.

 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with John Hart reaction &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) _ New Zealand international rugby
union player Aaron Hopa died Tuesday in a scuba diving training
accident on the Coromandel Peninsula, police said.
	   Hopa, 27, is thought to have drowned while completing a diving
course with other members of his Waikato rugby team.
	   Loose forward Hopa played four matches, but no tests, for the
All Blacks during their tour of Britain late last year.
	   Sgt. Brian Wotton of Whangamata police said Hopa was pronounced
dead after he had received cardio-pulmonary resuscitation for about
50 minutes.
	   Wotton said Hopa was diving with seven other members of the
Waikato rugby team as part of a diving course he had started on
Oct. 12.
	   After a strong first division season for Waikato, Hopa had been
named in the All Blacks summer training squad to prepare for the
World Cup.
	   ``There was no doubt in our minds that he was going to play a
large part in our planning for next year,'' All Blacks coach John
Hart said.
	   Hart described Hopa as ``a quiet achiever, a very quiet man,
very focussed.
	   ``He was a very humble sort of person, an excellent role model
and a person (whose life) has been taken in the prime of his
time.''

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with cyclone moving away from Darwin &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   DARWIN, Australia (AP) _ Cyclone Thelma, packing winds of 150
mph (240 kph) at its center, moved slowly away from Darwin, the
Bureau of Meteorology reported Tuesday afternoon.
	   The Bureau said at last report Thelma _ as intense as Cyclone
Tracy that destroyed Darwin in 1974 _ was about 100 miles (165 km)
northwest of the city over the Arafura Sea.
	   In the three hours to 2 p.m. Tuesday, the category four cyclone
had moved 15 miles (25 km) southwest toward Western Australia.
	   Thelma was moving parallel with the Northern Territory coast and
only its outer edge was affecting Darwin, the bureau said.
	   The ``very destructive core'' of the cyclone was just offshore
of the western end of Bathurst Island unleashing winds registering
105 mph (170 kph) there and on the other Tiwi island, Melville.
	   The Bureau said destructive wind gusts were no longer expected
in Darwin.

Cambodian refugees will head home soon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Potential stability offered by the
formation of a new government and the surrender of Khmer Rouge
guerrillas has cleared the way for more than 35,000 refugees to
return to Cambodia, a United Nations official said on Tuesday.
	   Although there is no timetable for the repatriation of the
refugees, ``their return should occur within a few months,'' said
Francois Fouinat, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
director of Asia and the Pacific.
	   Most of the refugees were forced into Thailand during Hun Sen's
violent coup against his co-prime minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh
last year. Several villages along the border were leveled as
Ranariddh's retreating forces fought Hun Sen's stronger army to a
stalemate.
	   A second wave of Cambodians came across the border in March as
the last Khmer Rouge stronghold of Anlong Veng was captured by a
combined force of government troops and defecting rebel fighters.
	   Following a close election in July, Hun Sen and Ranariddh
settled their differences last month and formed a coalition
government. Hun Sen became sole prime minister and the prince was
named president of the National Assembly.
	   The Hun Sen-Ranariddh pact convinced the last divisions of the
once-fierce Khmer Rouge guerrilla army that they could not win
their war against the government in Phnom Penh.
	   Eight rebel commanders surrendered to the government last week,
effectively ending the Maoist movement's 30-year armed
insurrection.
	   Fouinat said he had met with Hun Sen and Defense Ministry
officials during his one-week visit, and that both the government
and the UNHCR agreed that the main obstacles to the refugees'
return have been removed.
	   ``Certainly there is a momentum which has been created by these
recent developments here in Cambodia,'' Fouinat said.
	   ``The rest is a question of dealing with the more immediate
problems such as rehabilitation and construction of basic
infrastructure, mines and maybe a little bit of rebuilding
confidence,'' he said.
	   Amelia Bonifacio, director of the UNHCR border operation, said
an initial group of volunteers will be sent back to Cambodia in the
coming weeks to prove to more reluctant refugees that it is safe to
return.

Singapore Airlines has ``no interest'' in purchasing Philippine

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's flagship airline said Tuesday it
has ``no interest'' in purchasing troubled Philippine Airlines,
which has been seeking a buyer as it staggers under heavy debt.
	   Singapore Airlines, Asia's most profitable carrier, said in a
statement that it had ``decided to put an end to speculation'' it
would buy a substantial stake in the beleaguered Philippine
airline.
	   PAL had hoped for an infusion of capital to keep it afloat and
help it resume payments on dlrs 2.1 billion in debt. Talks with
Cathay Pacific Airlines ended last week because of irreconcilable
differences during their negotiations.
	   Following the Hong Kong airline's withdrawal, attention
refocused on Singapore Airlines, which had earlier expressed an
interest in Philippine Airlines following its brief closure in
September and October.
	   But the city-state's flag carrier has ``no interest in
purchasing Philippine Airlines, and, contrary to recent press
reports, no team from SIA is visiting Manila this week,'' said the
Tuesday statement.
	   Following the disintegration of talks with Cathay Pacific last
week, Philippine Airlines said it would attempt to rebuild on its
own.
	   Manolo Aquino, PAL's executive vice president, said Thursday
that the airline had a rehabilitation plan that ``does not provide
for a foreign-airline partner, but if there is one in the future,
that will be an enhancement.''

Park Myong Chul of North Korea, which is back in the games after
skipping the 1994 competition in Hiroshima, Japan.
	   South Korea's Yonhap news agency quoted Chang Ung, North Korea's
vice sports minister and secretary-general of its Olympic
committee, as saying that ``there will be no sports talks unless
political issues are resolved first, such as South Korea's national
security law.''
	   That law bans visits to North Korea without government approval
and prohibits acts that benefit, eulogize or encourage the
communist nation, which which the South technically is still at
war. No peace treaty was signed after the 1950-53 Korean War.
	   ``We tried our best, but North Korea's attitude was just too
stiff. But we intend to continue to make efforts to contact North
Korea,'' said Sung Sang-woo, a spokesman for South Korea's Ministry
of Culture and Tourism.
	   In the early 1990s, the two Koreas formed single soccer and
table tennis teams for international tournaments.
	   But further efforts failed. In July, the International Judo
Federation said the North had rejected a proposal to form a joint
team with South Korea for the federation's inaugural World Cup in
September.
	   South Korea, a co-host with Japan for the 2002 World Cup soccer
finals, has said it would like North Korea to stage two or three of
the 32 matches allotted to South Korea.
	   Joseph S. Blatter, head of FIFA, soccer's world government body,
has left the door open, but said political issues between the two
Koreas have to be solved first.
	   ``FIFA will not close the door. We are open to any dialogue,''
he said.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin, still recovering from pneumonia,
showed little sign of venturing out of the hospital Tuesday after a
surprise foray to the Kremlin the day before to fire several top
aides.
	   The often ailing president, apparently tired of being seen as
little more than a figurehead, roused himself from his sickbed for
three hours Monday and reshuffled his staff. The dismissed aides
included some who have commented recently on Yeltsin's weakened
health.
	   ``The president wanted to show who's the boss,'' said Alexander
Shokhin, leader of the pro-government party in parliament and,
until recently, a steady Yeltsin ally. ``He's like a lion who
licked his wounds and now roared at those who thought he was
already out of the game.''
	   Though Yeltsin's press center said no information was available
on the president's schedule, it looked like he would not emerge
Tuesday.
	   Presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said Monday Yeltsin
would remain in the hospital as long as necessary to recuperate.
	   Shown on television Monday evening, Yeltsin _ who rarely seems
so robust as when he is firing someone _ appeared energized as he
scowled and delivered one of his patented tirades.
	   ``Tough discipline, order and reform is what we need,'' Yeltsin
said slowly and sternly as he glared at his staff from the head of
a long table. Aides looked down and busied themselves scribbling
notes.
	   ``You can see how vigorous I am,'' Yeltsin said, according to
Yakushkin.
	   Among those sacked was presidential chief of staff Valentin
Yumashev, one of Yeltsin's most loyal aides. A former journalist
who was the ghost-writer of Yeltsin's memoirs, Yumashev had served
as chief of staff for nearly two years _ an eternity in Yeltsin's
Kremlin.
	   Yeltsin also said he was personally taking charge of ``all power
ministries ... including the Justice Ministry and the tax police.''
	   ``Power ministries'' are usually defined as those related to
national defense and security. The Justice Ministry and tax police
are at the forefront of the fight against crime and corruption.
	   Yeltsin's announcement was mostly symbolic, however, since he
already wields authority over all those ministries, and the
ministers who head them were left in place.
	   Gen. Nikolai Bordyuzha, 49, the chief of Russia's Border Guards,
was appointed the new chief of staff. He immediately called for
tackling corruption.
	   ``Fighting corruption is very important today, including in the
upper echelons of power,'' he said in an interview with Russia's
NTV television.
	   Yakushkin said Yeltsin dismissed the aides because of their
failure to stem crime or respond to several incidents of political
extremism, including anti-Semitic remarks by a Communist parliament
deputy.
	   The ousters were also thought to reflect Yeltsin's unhappiness
over aides' unusual candidness about his health. Yumashev and
others in the Kremlin have openly said that Yeltsin is too weak to
handle day-to-day affairs.
	   Yeltsin has said and done little since the economy went into a
tailspin in August, leaving Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov to
tackle the crisis.
	   Despite a rising chorus of calls for the president's
resignation, based on his poor health, Yeltsin has insisted he will
carry out his term until it ends in 2000.
	   Yeltsin has been hospitalized with pneumonia since Nov. 22.

Report: Flash flooding inundates historic Singapore district
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Flash flooding has swept through one of
Singapore's historic districts as heavy monsoon rains coincide with
high tides in the island republic, a newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   Parts of Singapore's Chinatown, which is undergoing conservation
and commercialization, were inundated with several feet of water
that stopped traffic and caused damage in local shops, said The
Straits Times.
	   ``The water level rose so quickly that I didn't even have time
to clear everything,'' shop owner Lim Su Seng was quoted as saying.
	   Newspaper photographs showed an elderly man being helped through
the knee-deep floods, and a worker sweeping water out of his
water-logged store.
	   Singapore's meteorological bureau said the flooding was caused
by heavy seasonal rains, which usually begin in December, falling
during early afternoon high tides.
	   The flash flooding was likely to continue in the short term,
added the report. Many parts of low-lying Singapore suffer from
occasional flooding during monsoon rains.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin has made yet another surreal,
unconvincing attempt to show Russia and the rest of the world there
is nothing wrong with him.
	   Yeltsin left the hospital Monday and went to the Kremlin for
three hours to dismiss aides who said what everyone knew _ the
president has health problems. Never mind that they also said
Yeltsin would and should stay in office.
	   While the rest of the world worries about Yeltsin's health, most
Russians don't seem to care. It's just not big news anymore.
	   The real irony is that while ordinary Russians have written
Yeltsin off, there still is one important group which does not want
him to step down _ the country's political leadership, including
some of his most vehement foes.
	   If Yeltsin were to resign early or die in office, there would
almost certainly be presidential elections, as the constitution
stipulates.
	   Many Russians would welcome elections, saying the country needs
a strong, effective leader to tackle its problems.
	   But with Russia in the grip of the worst economic crisis since
the fall of the Soviet Union, most political leaders and aspiring
presidential candidates prefer that Yeltsin stay in power for now
and take the blame.
	   Nobody has any real idea of how to tackle Russia's enormous
problems.
	   The economy is stuck between the old-Soviet system and failed
market reforms; the government's economic ministers don't know what
to do beyond begging for Western aid, even though billions have
already been wasted or stolen.
	   Even the Communists, the president's fiercest opponents, don't
seem keen to have their favorite target actually leave office any
time soon.
	   Top Communist leaders too have few solutions, and little
confidence that the electorate will back them.
	   The liberal reformers, who have backed Yeltsin in the past, are
deeply divided. Discredited by the failure of market reforms, they
can't agree on a presidential candidate.
	   The top two presidential candidates have problems of their own.
	   Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, who has the most powerful political
machine, is struggling to build support in the provinces, where
distrust of Moscow is strong and a major obstacle to his ambitions.
	   Nationalist leader Alexander Lebed constantly calls for
Yeltsin's removal, but still lacks the money and allies vital to
win the presidency.
	   Yeltsin has no idea of how to fix Russia's problems either. His
sole concern is clinging to power and telling everyone that he's in
charge, even if he stopped pretending long ago that he has any
solutions.
	   An ailing president who tries to rule from a hospital, some
Russians quip, is appropriate for a nation that is disintegrating.

Hong Kong stock exchange will impose pay freeze
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The Hong Kong Stock Exchange said Tuesday it
will join other major companies and freeze the salaries for its 450
employees next year.
	   ``The economy is not that good,'' said exchange spokesman Henry
Law.
	   The news follows a flurry of layoffs and salary freezes among
local companies.
	   HSBC, the territory's largest bank, said last week it would
freeze salaries for all its 13,000 staff in Hong Kong next year.
	   Union leaders fear more companies will cut or freeze salaries
ahead of the Chinese New Year, when most companies review their
operations. Often, companies in Hong Kong lay off unneeded workers
at the new year, handing them their annual bonus and offering a
traditional thanks for the year's service.
	   Hong Kong Telecommunications, Hong Kong's largest private
employer, is still in talks with union officials on various
cost-cutting plans.
	   Hong Kong's unemployment hit 5.3 percent in the third quarter,
the highest level since the government started keeping such
statistics in 1981.
	   The economy contracted by 7 percent in the third quarter, and is
expected to shrink by 5 percent for all of 1998.

DNA link claimed between Siberians and American Indians
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOSTON (AP) _ A Russian geneticist claims he has found an
extensive DNA match between American Indians and a nomadic people
living in a region north of Mongolia, according to a published
report.
	   Ilya Zakharov, deputy director of Moscow's Vavilov Institute of
General Genetics, told the Christian Science Monitor's Moscow
bureau that his genetic studies of the Turvan people in Siberia
have significantly narrowed the search for the exact origin of
American Indians.
	   ``This is a big breakthrough,'' he said. ``We had examined a lot
of populations before _ and by pure chance the results proved it
was the Turvans.''
	   Scientists have established that 30,000 to 40,000 years ago,
people with Asian roots migrated across ice sheets of Siberia's
Bearing Strait to Alaska, likely pursuing animals such as woolly
mammoths. And Geneticists speculate that America's first
inhabitants, numbering perhaps no more than 5,000 people, came from
northern China or Mongolia.
	   But Zakharov's research brings that thinking into sharper focus.
	   In an expedition he led last year to the Ak Dovurak region 2,100
miles southeast of Moscow, Zakharov took hair samples from about
430 Turvans. He analyzed the DNA contained within the hair root and
compared it to that of Eskimos and so-called Amerindian people,
including the Navajo and Apache.
	   Zakharov found that Amerindian DNA makeup exactly matched the
Turvans _ by 72 percent of one group of 30 samples and 69 percent
of another group of 300.
	   ``This (represents) the highest frequencies of Amerindian DNA
types ever found,'' he said. ``Several years ago some American,
Russian, and Mongolian scientists investigated Mongolian and
Chinese populations. The frequency of the same DNA types was nearer
to 45 percent.''
	   Turva, one of Russia's poorest regions, sits at the border of
Siberia's huge Taiga Forest and the steppes, or plains north of
Mongolia. The Turvans are a mainly nomadic, Turkic-speaking people.
They herd camels, sheep, goats reindeer and yak. In the 18th and 19
centuries, their land formed part of the Chinese empire.
	   ``It was a total surprise,'' Orlan Cholbeney, head of the Turva
mission in Moscow, said of Zakharov's findings. ``If we have a
mutual past, then we hope it will promote cooperation with the
Americans.''
	   Zakharov posted a summary of their findings in a recent issue of
the American Journal of Human Genetics. He said he would like next
to study residents of the bordering Khakassia and Altai regions,
who he thinks might have an even higher DNA match with Amerindians.
	   But a lack of money, not uncommon among Russian scientists, is a
major obstacle.
	   ``I think this discovery is fascinating, but I have no grants to
continue this project,'' he said.
	   Zakharov said he hopes other researchers who have expressed
interest in his work _ including Italian, American, and Brazilian
scientists _ will help keep it going.
	   The Christian Science Monitor is published in Boston.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) - Hundreds of chanting student
protesters in Indonesia converged Tuesday on the attorney general's
office to press their demand that former President Suharto be put
on trial.
	   About 300 students also demonstrated outside the Jakarta police
headquarters against the early morning arrest of two students who
were picked up by officers at their homes.
	   The detainees were suspected of involvement in the abduction of
a plainclothes officer at a demonstration on Nov. 27. The officer
was taken away in a taxi and released several hours later.
	   Suharto, who quit in May amid political turmoil and civil
unrest, was scheduled to appear Wednesday for questioning at the
office of Attorney General Andi Mohammad Ghalib.
	   However, students who helped oust Suharto say the government of
his successor and onetime protege, President B.J. Habibie, has not
been serious about investigating corruption allegations against the
former authoritarian leader.
	   ``Hang Suharto,'' shouted 500 students who arrived in buses at
Ghalib's office, a frequent target of protests in recent weeks.
	   Some protesters shook the locked gates to the compound, which
was occupied for one day last month during a demonstration. Riot
police stood nearby but did not intervene.
	   Inside, prosecutors questioned Tunky Ariwibowo, a former trade
and industry minister who has been accused of providing perks that
enriched the business empires of Suharto's children.
	   Tunky was questioned about his role in a so-called ``national
car'' project, through which Suharto's son, Hutomo Mandala Putra,
was licensed to import cars from Korea's Kia Motors Corp. without
having to pay import tariffs.
	   Habibie, a former research and technology minister, has pledged
to fight government graft that thrived during the rule of Suharto,
whose wealth was estimated by Forbes magazine at dlrs 4 billion.
	   But critics say Habibie, whose family owns dozens of businesses,
is too compromised by his links to the old regime to wipe out
corruption that contributed to Indonesia's economic crisis.
	   Ghalib questioned Suharto several months ago during an earlier
investigation that failed to find any evidence against the former
president. Students said it was a whitewash.
	   The Southeast Asian nation of 202 million people is beset by
high unemployment and inflation, as well as sporadic riots and
student protests for swifter political reforms.
	   Also Tuesday, The Jakarta Post reported that corrupt practices
have cost the country 1.7 trillion rupiah (dlrs 225 million) in
lost revenues since Habibie took office.
	   The losses, which spanned from May to September this year, came
primarily from the departments of mines and energy, public works,
culture and education and transportation.
	   The Post cited Soedarjono, head of the government's internal
audit department, as saying the losses were determined from
investigating 8,435 development projects.

was finally announced Monday by agents David Falk and Arn Tellem.
	   ``The Game on Showtime'' is set for Dec. 19 in Atlantic City,
N.J., with the proceeds going to charity and to NBA players in
financial need.
	   ``If you look at people who play professional sports, not a lot
of them are financially secure,'' union president Patrick Ewing
said. ``They make a lot of money, and they also spend a lot of
money.
	   ``Me, I'm financially secure, but there a lot of others who
aren't. Our objective is to help these people. No matter how much
money they've made throughout their careers, if they're in need now
then it's up to us to try and help them,'' Ewing said.
	   Thirteen players are committed to play, and organizers hope to
have a total of 16 players who were members of the four Dream teams
_ the 1992 and 1996 Olympic teams and the 1994 and 1998 World
Championship teams.
	   Ewing, Karl Malone, Penny Hardaway, Tim Hardaway, Allan Houston,
Reggie Miller, Alonzo Mourning, Tom Gugliotta, Gary Payton,
Dominique Wilkins, Vin Baker, Glen Rice and Mitch Richmond have
committed.
	   Among those who have not are Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, Charles
Barkley, Scottie Pippen, Isiah Thomas, Shaquille O'Neal, Hakeem
Olajuwon, Grant Hill and John Stockton.
	   Derrick Coleman and Larry Johnson, members of the 1994 World
Championship team, were not invited.
	   Jordan's absence is particularly noteworthy because Falk, his
agent, is one of the main organizers.
	   ``Michael has said he won't make a decision about returning to
professional basketball or retiring until the lockout is over,''
said Curtis Polk, president of Falk's sports management company.
``We did talk to Michael about the game, obviously, and Michael
feels he needs to stand by his earlier statement that he'll wait
for a resolution of the lockout before he makes that decision. He
wouldn't want to send the fans a sort of mixed message by his
participation in this game.''
	   Ewing said Jordan might show up, but won't play.
	   The Atlantic City game will be the latest in a recent string of
exhibitions involving locked out players. Games were held last
weekend in Miami and Dallas, and another is scheduled for next
Sunday in Los Angeles.
	   Jay Larkin, executive producer of Showtime, would not reveal how
much the cable network was paying for the broadcast rights.
	   Polk said the largest expense would be insurance, with every
player covered for dlrs 20 million against a career-ending injury.
	   None of the players will be paid, and no criteria have been
established for determining which players will share in the
proceeds.
	   ``We would rather have the players participating in NBA games,''
deputy commissioner Russ Granik said. ``That's why the owners have
made a proposal to the union that guarantees players' salaries will
continue to grow and remain the highest in pro sports.''
	   Mourning said they're not asking for the fans' sympathy and
added that few people realize how many financial obligations
players have. The lockout, now 23 weeks old, has caused the first
two months of the season to be scrapped. No new negotiations are
planned.
	   Organizers hoped to raise at least dlrs 1 million in proceeds.
The game will be held at the Atlantic City Convention Center, which
seats about 17,000. Tickets will cost from dlrs 25 to dlrs 1,000.
	   The league is negotiating with the city, through the Mayor's
office, to find ways of softening the impact on hotels which had
blocked off rooms for the weekend, the paper said. It cited
``people with knowledge of the negotiations and of the NBA's
decision'' as the source of its information.
	   The league booked dlrs 3 million worth of rooms. The hotels
could have earned that much in food and beverage sales.

High-level ASEAN officials start pre-summit meetings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Economic turmoil and a membership
application from Cambodia topped the agenda Tuesday at a meeting of
high-level officials from the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations to prepare for next week's summit.
	   The officials have begun fine-tuning a declaration that will be
signed by their leaders at the Dec. 15-16 ASEAN summit meeting,
said a Vietnamese delegate who declined to be named.
	   The joint statement calls for increased liberalization of trade
and services, faster implementation of a regional tariff agreement,
better monitoring of economies in the region and stepped-up
deregulation of the financial sector.
	   Tuesday's agenda included discussions about expanding an ASEAN
member industrial cooperation scheme for a limited period because
of the region's economic problems due to the Asian financial
crisis.
	   Foreign ministers and economic ministers from ASEAN's nine
current members will meet separately Friday and Saturday, then
jointly on Sunday.
	   One of the main topics they were expected to deal with was
Cambodia's application for membership in ASEAN, which was given a
boost Monday when the United Nations agreed to restore its
representation at the world body.
	   Cambodian Foreign Minister Hor Nam Hong told the U.N. General
Assembly session that now there was nothing more standing in the
way of his country from joining ASEAN.
	   ASEAN leaders had put the application on hold until Cambodia
installed a new government, which occurred late last month.
	   ASEAN includes Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines,
Singapore, Brunei, Vietnam, Myanmar and Laos. Japan, South Korea
and China also will attend the summit as ``dialogue partners.''
	   A Vietnamese official indicated his country will try to receive
some of the funds to be allocated in the ``Miyazawa package,''
Japan's dlrs 30 billion initiative to help economically troubled
Asian nations.
	   Vietnam is hosting the summit for the first time since becoming
a member in 1995.

With oil revenues slashed, Gulf faces hard economic choices
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANWAR FARUQI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ Leaders of six Gulf Arab
countries, meeting Tuesday amid plunging oil prices, are trying to
hammer out a common strategy to head off a growing economic crisis.
	   The Gulf countries, which together sit on half the world's
proven oil reserves and depend on exports for 75 percent of their
revenues, also are expected to discuss spending cuts and attracting
foreign investment by ending protectionist policies.
	   Shortly before the meeting of the Gulf Cooperation Council began
Monday, January futures contracts for Brent crude _ a widely
watched benchmark _ fell to a record low of dlrs 9.92 a barrel on
the International Petroleum Exchange in London. The contracts
closed at dlrs 10.26.
	   Gulf oil generally sells at a dollar or two less than the North
Sea's Brent _ which itself was selling for around dlrs 20 a barrel
as recently as 1997.
	   The Gulf oil producers have been hard hit by the sagging prices,
which are blamed on the recession in Asia and warmer-than-usual
winters.
	   Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter and a key member
of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, is expected
to submit a proposal for a GCC economic and oil bloc that would
give the group a strong position in the international oil market,
said sources in the Saudi capital, Riyadh.
	   ``The main source of our income has been greatly shaken by the
imbalance of the oil market,'' Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Abdullah
said Monday.
	   ``Such an imbalance requires us to exert our utmost efforts
inside and outside OPEC,'' said Abdullah, who is leading the Saudi
delegation to the GCC in place of his ailing half-brother, King
Fahd.
	   The GCC groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and
the Emirates in a political, economic and defense alliance that
dates back to 1981.
	   The summit has an agenda that includes Iran's occupation of
three Emirates' islands, a proposed U.S. missile system for the
region, and a joint U.S. and British plan to overthrow Iraq's
President Saddam Hussein.
	   But oil was the main thing on everyone's mind.
	   Gulf Arab oil ministers are among the large delegations
attending the summit. GCC officials said they have been asked to
draw up a proposal on ways to boost prices on the international oil
market.
	   The Gulf producers have been grappling with widening budget
deficits and problems paying foreign debts. Saudi Arabia, for
example, had projected a dlrs 4.8 billion budget deficit for 1998,
but analysts predict it will reach dlrs 15 billion.
	   ``The projected increases in the GCC budget deficits are
expected to leave a negative impact on their economic
development,'' said Mohammad Khalfan Khirbash, the Emirates
minister of finance.
	   The GCC countries, long used to free spending fueled by their
oil revenues, are now having to grapple with some difficult
choices.
	   They were expected to invest up to dlrs 90 billion in major
projects in the next five years, of which dlrs 25 billion was to go
for the oil and gas sectors. Those plans may have to be scaled down
_ or shelved altogether.
	   In the defense sector alone, the Gulf Arab countries have bought
tens of billions of dollars in arms over the past decade. They were
expected to spend another dlrs 80 billion more over the next four
years.
	   In a speech at the opening of the three-day summit, U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan noted that countries in the oil-rich
region were the biggest spenders on arms and called for cuts in
their defense budgets.
	   Annan and South African President Nelson Mandela both spoke at
the opening session. It was the first time leaders outside the
group were invited to the summit.
	   Leaders at the summit have been calling for an end to
protectionist policies that have hindered foreign investments. Full
foreign ownership _ without a local partner holding the majority
share _ is not allowed anywhere in the Gulf.
	   A U.N. report last year said that foreign capital inflow to the
GCC countries was only dlrs 410 million in 1996, despite a
favorable environment. Khirbash, the Emirates' finance minister,
said this was due to restrictions on ownership and slow movement
toward privatization.
	   Abdullah on Monday called for the private sector in GCC
countries to play a more active role.
	   But throughout the GCC, most large corporations are state-run or
owned by the ruling families.

Singapore awards military helicopter servicing contract to
</HEADLINE>
Australian firm

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore has awarded a dlrs 15.4 million
contract to service the Southeast Asian city-state's most advanced
military helicopters to an Australian firm, the Ministry of Defense
said Tuesday.
	   Bristow Helicopers Australia will begin servicing the 12
American-made Super Puma attack helicopters that the island
republic maintains at the Australian Army Aviation Center in Oakey,
Queensland.
	   The three-year contract covers maintenance, general technical
support and scheduled servicing, the statement from Singapore's
defense ministry said.
	   Singapore and Australia are both members of the Five Power
Defense Arrangement, a 27-year old military pact that also includes
Britain, Malaysia and New Zealand.
	   The two countries also participate in their own joint military
exercises, and Australia has allowed Singapore to conduct
large-scale military exercises and train fighter pilots and other
military personnel on its territory.

Yeltsin fires key aides during a brief break from hospital
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With PM-Russia-Failing Yeltsin, Bjt &QL; 
 &UR; By NICK WADHAMS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin, still recovering from pneumonia,
showed little sign of venturing out of the hospital today after a
surprise foray to the Kremlin the day before to fire several top
aides.
	   The often ailing president, apparently tired of being seen as
little more than a figurehead, roused himself from his sickbed for
three hours Monday and reshuffled his staff. The dismissed aides
included some who have commented recently on Yeltsin's weakened
health.
	   ``The president wanted to show who's the boss,'' said Alexander
Shokhin, leader of the pro-government party in parliament and,
until recently, a steady Yeltsin ally. ``He's like a lion who
licked his wounds and now roared at those who thought he was
already out of the game.''
	   Though Yeltsin's press center said no information was available
on the president's schedule, it looked like he would not emerge
today.
	   Presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said Monday that Yeltsin
would remain in the hospital as long as necessary.
	   Shown on television Monday evening, Yeltsin _ who rarely seems
so robust as when he is firing someone _ appeared energized as he
scowled and delivered one of his patented tirades.
	   ``Tough discipline, order and reform is what we need,'' Yeltsin
said slowly and sternly as he glared at his staff from the head of
a long table. Aides looked down and busied themselves scribbling
notes.
	   ``You can see how vigorous I am,'' Yeltsin said, according to
Yakushkin.
	   Among those sacked was presidential chief of staff Valentin
Yumashev, one of Yeltsin's most loyal aides. A former journalist
who ghostwrote Yeltsin's memoirs, Yumashev had served as chief of
staff for nearly two years _ an eternity in Yeltsin's Kremlin.
	   Yeltsin also said he was personally taking charge of ``all power
ministries ... including the Justice Ministry and the tax police.''
	   ``Power ministries'' are usually defined as those related to
national defense and security. The Justice Ministry and tax police
are at the forefront of the fight against crime and corruption.
	   Yeltsin's announcement was mostly symbolic, however, since he
already wields authority over all those ministries, and the
ministers who head them were left in place.
	   Gen. Nikolai Bordyuzha, 49, the chief of Russia's Border Guards,
was appointed the new chief of staff. He immediately called for
tackling corruption.
	   ``Fighting corruption is very important today, including in the
upper echelons of power,'' he said in an interview with Russia's
NTV television.
	   Yakushkin said Yeltsin dismissed the aides because of their
failure to stem crime or respond to several incidents of political
extremism, including anti-Semitic remarks by a Communist parliament
deputy.
	   The ousters were also thought to reflect Yeltsin's unhappiness
over aides' unusual candidness about his health. Yumashev and
others in the Kremlin have openly said that Yeltsin is too weak to
handle day-to-day affairs.
	   Yeltsin has said and done little since the economy went into a
tailspin in August, leaving Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov to
tackle the crisis.
	   Despite a rising chorus of calls for the president's
resignation, based on his poor health, Yeltsin has insisted he will
carry out his term until it ends in 2000.
	   Yeltsin has been hospitalized with pneumonia since Nov. 22.

Clashes injure 150 people in Bangladesh town
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Police fired rubber bullets and tear
gas to scatter Islamic extremists who attacked development workers
for helping poor village women start businesses, officials said
Tuesday.
	   At least 150 people were injured Monday in Brahmmanbaria, 50
miles (80 kilometers) east of Dhaka, as hundreds of women who
receive loans from private development agencies marched in support
of the programs. The extremists say Muslim women should not leave
their homes to work.
	   Another 60 people were injured on Sunday when police used batons
to disperse development workers trying to hold a rally in the
town's soccer stadium. Authorities had banned the rally after
extremists threatened to attack the demonstrators.
	   ``We will not bow to the pressure of the fundamentalists. Our
programs to help the poor women will continue,'' Kazi Farooq Ahmed,
president of the Association of Development Agencies in Bangladesh,
said in a telephone interview.
	   The association comprises the country's more than 1,000 agencies
that provide jobs, education and health care to village women with
funds from Western countries.
	   Unable to hold their rally, the demonstrators marched to
showcase their programs that help more than 4 million women start
businesses such as running grocery stores with loans as small as
4,000 takas (dlrs 100). Scores of Islamic extremists armed with
iron rods and homemade fire crackers attacked the procession, a
police official said in a telephone interview on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   The attackers from the town's Islamic schools also torched
offices of some development agencies and looted stores, the police
official said.
	   Extremists Islamic groups have little power in Bangladesh, a
predominantly Muslim country that is governed by mostly secular
laws. However, they have influence on illiterate rural people.

Bulls dreaming of Dow 10,000
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHET CURRIER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Approaching the end of a wild year of ups and
downs in the stock market, Wall Street's bulls still have their
sights set on a target of Dow 10,000.
	   That bull-market milestone is only a few hundred points beyond
the record highs of 9,300-plus set by Dow Jones's average of 30
blue chip industrials in July and November.
	   Even with its recent drop back below the 9,000 level, the
average would need a gain of only 12 percent to 13 percent in 1999
to take it into five-digit territory. The Dow has performed that
well or better in each of the past four years.
	   Indeed, analysts such as Thomas Galvin at Donaldson, Lufkin and
Jenrette Securities and Yale Hirsch, publisher of the annual Stock
Trader's Almanac, talk up 11,000 as a possibility by the end of
next year.
	   This kind of optimism is by no means unanimous, however. Many
professional investors, including people who run some of the big
stock mutual funds, say it's very dangerous to project the future
as a straight line running out of the recent past.
	   To their way of thinking, the market's dramatic comeback this
fall from its late-summer selloff looked like too much too soon,
putting stocks back on the same overvalued perch from which they
fell in July and August.
	   Along with misgivings about valuation, many observers worry that
corporate earnings growth will be a lot weaker in the foreseeable
future than the torrid pace _ about 13 percent a year, by some
measures _ set over the past five years. ``This has been the best
period of profit growth in this century,'' said John Ballen, chief
investment officer at MFS Investment Management in Boston.
	   But Galvin at DLJ says he believes annual earnings growth can
continue at 10 percent to 12 percent over the next three years,
bolstered by such influences as technological progress and
opportunities to make new foreign investments at attractive costs.
	   He also suggests that the so-called Y2K problem, involving the
need to reconfigure many computers by the time the year 2,000
arrives, may have the beneficial side effect of increasing
efficiency and productivity as it forces a general upgrade of
computer systems.
	   ``We believe that as the consensus begins to ponder these
factors, the bleak outlook currently shared by most will slowly
dissipate,'' Galvin concludes.
	   Hirsch, in the 1999 edition of his annual almanac, argues that
the market is moving into the most bullish part of the four-year
political cycle, the year before a presidential election. ``No
pre-presidential election year has lost ground in 60 years,'' he
says.
	   His explanation for this pattern: ``Electing a president every
four years has set in motion a political stock market cycle. Most
bear markets take place in the first or second years after
elections. Then the market improves.
	   ``What happens is that each administration usually does
everything in its power to juice up the economy so that voters are
in a positive mood at election time.''
	   Most important of all for the bullish case, say many analysts,
is the recent series of three credit-easing moves by the Federal
Reserve aimed at steering the economy clear of recession. Late last
week, 11 European central banks also took steps to lower key
interest rates.
	   ``Life is good when central bankers are on our side,'' says Greg
Smith, investment strategist at Prudential Securities. ``When
central banks decide to provide more liquidity, they exert a
powerful positive force.
	   ``There's every reason to believe that swift and significant
action can prevent some of the economic problems that worried the
world this summer from actually coming to pass.''

Dollar rises against yen in Tokyo, Japanese stocks close higher
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with closing stock, mid-afternoon dollar, bond
prices.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar gained against the yen Tuesday as
an overnight rise on Wall Street generated optimism about the
strength of America's economic boom. Japanese stock prices closed
higher.
	   The dollar bought 120.24 yen in mid-afternoon trading, up 1.28
yen from late Monday in Tokyo and also above its late New York
level of 119.81 yen overnight.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 84.71
points, or 0.58 percent, to close the day at 14,808.20. On Monday,
the average finished up 83.52 points, or 0.57 percent.
	   The dollar surged past the 120 yen barrier in early trading on
Wall Street's rise and stayed above that level throughout the day.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 9,070.47 points on
Monday, up 54.33.
	   On Friday, the U.S. Labor Department said the nation's
unemployment rate stood at a 28-year low. That data was helpful in
diffusing increasing speculation the Federal Reserve would move to
again ease interest rates in the near future.
	   Expectations of lower interest rates put downward pressure on
the U.S. currency as reduced rates mean lower yields on
dollar-denominated deposits.
	   Sentiment prompting dollar-buying was also bolstered after U.S.
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin denied a Japanese media report that
he planned to resign.
	   ``There was some sort of report out ... but it was totally,
absolutely, 100 percent erroneous,'' Rubin said Monday before
delivering a speech in New York.
	   The dollar briefly sank Monday after Japan's Sankei newspaper
quoted an unidentified U.S. government official as saying that
Rubin had told President Clinton that he wanted to step down.
	   The U.S. currency also strengthened as investors covered short,
or oversold, positions.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, share prices rose as the overnight
gains on Wall Street sent shares of Japanese international blue
chips higher.
	   Some domestic-oriented companies also gained after Bank of Japan
Gov. Masaru Hayami said that the current stability in Japanese
stocks and a recent rise in long-term interest rates could help
bring optimism back to Japan's financial markets.
	   But traders remained cautious as they awaited more news on
coalition plans between the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and
minority Liberal Party, analysts said.
	   Market players hope the coalition will result in new economic
stimulus measures, such as more aggressive tax cuts, which the
Liberal Party favors.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
exchange's first section climbed 6.99 points, or 0.62 percent, to
close at 1131.99. The TOPIX closed up 4.28 points, or 0.38 percent,
the day before.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond slipped to 1.045 percent from Monday's finish of 1.060
percent, pushing its price up to 106.52 yen from 106.38 yen.

Mayo Clinic to open office in United Arab Emirates
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ The U.S.-based Mayo Clinic
will open its first Middle East representative office in Dubai
early next year, a company official said Tuesday.
	   The Dubai office will process papers for patients seeking
appointments, regional director Taysir Khatib told The Associated
Press. He said the office also will send potential patients'
laboratory samples for testing to the clinic's three facilities in
Rochester, Minn.; Jacksonville, Fla., and Scottsdale, Ariz.
	   Khatib said Dubai was chosen for the regional office because
nearly half of the 2,500 Arab patients visiting the Mayo Clinic
every year come from the Emirates.
	   He said plans also were under way to open a telemedicine program
with Abu Dhabi's Al-Mafraq Hospital by mid-January.
	   The most famous Arab personality currently undergoing treatment
at the Rochester clinic is King Hussein of Jordan. He has been
there since mid-July for cancer treatment.
	   Some 1,600 physicians representing more than 100 medical
specialties work at the Mayo facilities. They treat about 400,000
Americans and 9,000 foreigners every year, Khatib said.

Titanic-type steel looked at in sinking of British battleship
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The same type of steel that cracked open when
the Titanic struck an iceberg also may have doomed the pride of the
Royal Navy _ the battlecruiser HMS Hood _ the largest and most
powerful warship of the era, U.S. researchers say.
	   During the 1920s and 1930s, the ship was considered the
pre-eminent symbol of British imperial power. Nicknamed ``The
Mighty Hood,'' it was frequently used for glamorous
``show-the-flag'' cruises around the world. And like the Titanic,
Hood was perceived as unsinkable.
	   But on a cold May morning in 1941, the aging ship was virtually
pulverized in an engagement with the new German battleship Bismarck
off the coast of Greenland. Of Hood's crew of 1,418, only three
survived one of the worst disasters in British naval history.
	   Naval enthusiasts are seeking to exploit the current global
interest in underwater exploration generated by the film
``Titanic'' to mount an expedition to locate and film the wreck of
the Hood. It lies 1 1/2 miles (2.4 kilometers) below the Denmark
Straits, some of the most inhospitable waters on earth.
	   The Titanic sank off Newfoundland on April 15, 1912, soon after
it struck an iceberg on its maiden voyage from England to New York.
More than 1,500 people perished.
	   Researchers have found evidence that the liner sank because the
impact popped apart the luxury liner's dangerously fragile hull
plates and rivets.
	   In contrast, the cause of the Hood's disintegration remains
unclear, but the speed with which the 46,000-ton, 860-foot
(258-meter) battlecruiser broke apart has led experts to theorize
that a fire spreading from the deck to her magazines may have
sparked an explosion, which in turn overstressed the hull.
	   Timothy Foecke, a metallurgist at the National Institute of
Standards and Technology in Gaithersburg, Maryland, said the ships'
steel _ although state-of-the-art at the time _ was ``very
strain-rate sensitive.'' In other words, he said, like Silly Putty,
it will stretch if pulled apart slowly but it will snap if it is
pulled quickly.
	   ``If the Hood's hull was disassembled very quickly by an
explosion, then the steel may have indeed behaved very brittlely,''
said Foecke, who conducted extensive tests on metal fragments from
Titanic.
	   The two ships were built at different shipyards and several
years apart, but records show they were constructed from the same
kind of steel, supplied to both ships by the manufacturer D.
Colville and Co. of Motherwell, Scotland. The company no longer
exists.
	   William Garzke of the U.S. Society of Naval Architects in
Arlington, Virginia, said tests on recovered segments of the
Titanic showed the rivets and plates were liable to crack easily
under pressure, in contrast to the much more flexible steel used
today.
	   ``It is possible this was a factor in the sinking of the Hood,''
Garzke said.
	   Because the technology of deep-sea exploration has advanced so
rapidly, even the most inaccessible shipwrecks now are reachable by
deep-diving submersibles. Equally important, the once-prohibitive
cost has fallen sharply.
	   ``All the research and planning for the project has been done
and it could be undertaken very quickly,'' said David Mearns, an
American undersea search expert trying to raise money for the
venture. It would involve mapping and filming the wreck. Under
British law, the ship cannot otherwise be disturbed since it is
listed as a war grave.
	   ``That ship is an important part of British history; its sinking
was a huge event in World War II,'' Mearns said.
	   In his memoirs, Britain's wartime prime minister, Winston
Churchill, described the ship as ``one of our most cherished naval
possessions.''
	   ``Her loss was a bitter grief,'' Churchill wrote.
	   During the May 24 clash, Hood was initially struck by a shell
that set ablaze some small-caliber antiaircraft ammunition
scattered on her deck.
	   Moments later, nearby British ships saw flames shooting up from
her middle section, where the powder magazines were located, and
Hood snapped apart midship. The battlecruiser's bow and stern sank
separately in two minutes even as her 15-inch guns blasted a final
salvo at the enemy.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin, still recovering from pneumonia,
showed little sign of venturing out of the hospital Tuesday after a
surprise foray to the Kremlin the day before to fire several top
aides.
	   The often ailing president, apparently tired of being seen as
little more than a figurehead, roused himself from his sickbed for
three hours Monday and reshuffled his staff. The dismissed aides
included some who have commented recently on Yeltsin's weakened
health.
	   ``The president wanted to show who's the boss,'' said Alexander
Shokhin, leader of the pro-government party in parliament and,
until recently, a steady Yeltsin ally. ``He's like a lion who
licked his wounds and now roared at those who thought he was
already out of the game.''
	   Though Yeltsin's press center said no information was available
on the president's schedule, it looked like he would not emerge
Tuesday.
	   Presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said Monday Yeltsin
would remain in the hospital as long as necessary to recuperate.
	   Shown on television Monday evening, Yeltsin _ who rarely seems
so robust as when he is firing someone _ appeared energized as he
scowled and delivered one of his patented tirades.
	   ``Tough discipline, order and reform is what we need,'' Yeltsin
said slowly and sternly as he glared at his staff from the head of
a long table. Aides looked down and busied themselves scribbling
notes.
	   ``You can see how vigorous I am,'' Yeltsin said, according to
Yakushkin.
	   Among those sacked was presidential chief of staff Valentin
Yumashev, one of Yeltsin's most loyal aides. A former journalist
who was the ghost-writer of Yeltsin's memoirs, Yumashev had served
as chief of staff for nearly two years _ an eternity in Yeltsin's
Kremlin.
	   Yeltsin also said he was personally taking charge of ``all power
ministries ... including the Justice Ministry and the tax police.''
	   ``Power ministries'' are usually defined as those related to
national defense and security. The Justice Ministry and tax police
are at the forefront of the fight against crime and corruption.
	   Yeltsin's announcement was mostly symbolic, however, since he
already wields authority over all those ministries, and the
ministers who head them were left in place.
	   Gen. Nikolai Bordyuzha, 49, the secretary of the presidential
security council, was appointed the new chief of staff. Bordyuzha,
who will serve in both posts, immediately called for tackling
corruption.
	   ``Fighting corruption is very important today, including in the
upper echelons of power,'' he said in an interview with Russia's
NTV television.
	   Yakushkin said Yeltsin dismissed the aides because of their
failure to stem crime or respond to several incidents of political
extremism, including anti-Semitic remarks by a Communist parliament
deputy.
	   The ousters were also thought to reflect Yeltsin's unhappiness
over aides' unusual candidness about his health. Yumashev and
others in the Kremlin have openly said that Yeltsin is too weak to
handle day-to-day affairs.
	   Yeltsin has said and done little since the economy went into a
tailspin in August, leaving Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov to
tackle the crisis.
	   Despite a rising chorus of calls for the president's
resignation, based on his poor health, Yeltsin has insisted he will
carry out his term until it ends in 2000.
	   Yeltsin has been hospitalized with pneumonia since Nov. 22.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Police on Tuesday raided a university campus
building and 20 other hideouts used by a left-wing group in a
sweeping search for evidence group members disrupted a recent
speech by Chinese President Jiang Zemin.
	   The leftists were suspected of violating trespassing and
obstruction of justice ordinances during Jiang's speech at Waseda
University in Tokyo on Nov. 28, a Metropolitan Police Department
spokesman said, speaking on the customary condition of anonymity.
	   Investigators confiscated about 100 items, including written
materials and floppy disks, from the student union building inside
Waseda University and local offices of the ultra left-wing
Revolutionary Marxist Faction.
	   Three student members of the faction were arrested during
Jiang's speech at the university after shouting their opposition to
China's nuclear arms development program.
	   Jiang's speech, which urged Japan to not forget its militaristic
past, was momentarily interrupted by heckling protesters.
	   One demonstrator unfurled a banner reading: ``Down with the
Jiang regime.''
	   Right-wing Japanese nationalists also protested Jiang's visit
last month, clashing with security personnel outside venues visited
by the Chinese leader.

While Clemens talks go on, 11 free agents re-sign

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ As Toronto focused its Roger Clemens trade talks
and Steve Finley agreed to a dlrs 21.5 million, four-year deal with
Arizona, 11 free agents re-signed with their former team before
Monday's midnight deadline.
	   Eight more, including San Diego pitcher Kevin Brown, were
offered salary arbitration and may continue to negotiate with their
former teams through Jan. 8.
	   Reliever Jeff Montgomery was the first to make a decision,
agreeing in the afternoon to stay with Kansas City for a dlrs 2.5
million, one-year contract _ a dlrs 300,000 paycut.
	   Third baseman Gary Gaetti re-signed with the Chicago Cubs for a
dlrs 2 million, one-year contract and outfielder Glenallen Hill
stayed for a dlrs 1.15 million, one-year deal.
	   St. Louis also re-signed a pair of players, agreeing to a dlrs 1
million, one-year contract with outfielder Willie McGee and a
minor-league deal with infielder Pat Kelly that would turn into a
dlrs 550,000, one-year contract if he's added to the roster.
	   Anaheim, which last week signed Mo Vaughn to a record dlrs 80
million, six-year contract, re-signed three players. Infielder
Randy Velarde got an dlrs 800,000, one-year contract, pitcher Jack
McDowell got a dlrs 500,000, one-year deal and infielder Craig
Shipley got a minor-league contract. Shipley would get a dlrs
400,000, one-year contract if he makes the team.
	   Mark Langston, who gave up a tiebreaking grand slam to the
Yankees' Tino Martinez in the World Series opener, agreed to a
minor-league contract with San Diego, he would get a dlrs 750,000
contract if he's added to the Padres' roster.
	   Dave Stieb, who went 1-2 with a 4.83 ERA for Toronto in his
comeback, agreed to a minor league deal with the Blue Jays. Stieb,
who hadn't pitched since 1993, would get a dlrs 400,000, one-year
contract if he makes the team.
	   Cleveland re-signed outfielder Mark Whiten to a dlrs 450,000,
one-year deal.
	   The 11 players offered arbitration were Brown (Padres), pitchers
Bill Swift (Mariners) and Roger Pavlik (Rangers) and five catchers:
Terry Steinbach (Twins), Mike Macfarlane (Athletics), John Marzano
(Mariners), Kirt Manwaring (Rockies) and Tom Lampkin (Cardinals).
	   In addition, teams offered arbitration to three players who
already have agreed to contract but haven't completed the
paperwork: Baltimore to Alan Mills (who signed with Los Angeles),
the Chicago White Sox to Albert Belle (who signed with Baltimore)
and San Diego to Brown. By offering arbitration, teams ensure
they'll get draft picks as compensation next June.
	   Players offered arbitration have through Dec. 19 to accept or
reject the offers and may negotiate with their former teams through
Jan. 8. Starting Tuesday, teams can sign them without losing any
draft picks.
	   Among the players who can't re-sign are Jose Canseco (Blue
Jays), Steve Avery and Tim Naehring (Red Sox), Jim Abbott (White
Sox), Rickey Henderson (Athletics), Sean Berry (Astros), John Jaha
(Brewers) and Orel Hershiser (Giants).
	   In addition, the New York Yankees have worked out a special
arrangement to keep Darryl Strawberry. In a method approved by the
union and owners, he will withdraw his free-agent filing, the
Yankees will fail to offer him a contract by the Dec. 20 tender
deadline and will then re-sign him to a minor-league contract.
	   The day began with Finley joining the stampede of free agents to
Arizona. The Diamondbacks spent dlrs 118.9 million on six free
agents during the past month in a dramatic effort to transform an
expansion team that lost 97 games into a NL contender.
	   ``I'm going to be 34 next season,'' he said. ``I'm not a
22-year-old who's going to play another 10 or 12 years and maybe
have a couple of chances to go. I want to win now. When I saw they
signed (Randy) Johnson, I wanted to be here then for sure.''
	   Finley gets a dlrs 500,000 signing bonus and salaries of dlrs
5.25 million per season. He is deferring dlrs 2.5 million in each
of the first two years and dlrs 2 million in each of the last two,
all at 6 percent interest for four years.

Mayo Clinic to open office in United Arab Emirates
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ The U.S.-based Mayo Clinic
will open its first Middle East representative office in Dubai
early next year, a company official said Tuesday.
	   The Dubai office will process papers for patients seeking
appointments, regional director Taysir Khatib told The Associated
Press. He said the office also will send potential patients'
laboratory samples for testing to the clinic's three facilities in
Rochester, Minnesota; Jacksonville, Florida, and Scottsdale,
Arizona.
	   Khatib said Dubai was chosen for the regional office because
nearly half of the 2,500 Arab patients visiting the Mayo Clinic
every year come from the Emirates.
	   He said plans also were under way to open a telemedicine program
with Abu Dhabi's Al-Mafraq Hospital by mid-January.
	   The most famous Arab personality currently undergoing treatment
at the Rochester clinic is King Hussein of Jordan. He has been
there since mid-July for cancer treatment.
	   Some 1,600 physicians representing more than 100 medical
specialties work at the Mayo facilities. They treat about 400,000
Americans and 9,000 foreigners every year, Khatib said.

Pacific port city of Vladivostok declares state of emergency
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Officials in Russia's Pacific port city of
Vladivostok declared a state of emergency because half the
buildings in the city are without heat as temperatures drop below
freezing, a news report said Monday.
	   Schools and day care centers have been closed, and hospitals
will soon be evacuated if the situation doesn't improve in
Vladivostok, about 6,400 kilometers (4,000 miles) east of Moscow,
according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Making matters worse, the city was inundated early Monday by a
major snow storm, Interfax said.
	   City officials blame local energy supplier Dalenergo for the
shortage. They say Dalenergo is poorly managed and doesn't maintain
its equipment.
	   More than 500 apartment buildings in the city aren't getting
heat because of leaks in steam pipes belonging to Dalenergo,
according to Interfax.
	   The Vladivostok city administration sent an emergency appeal to
Russian President Boris Yeltsin requesting that he set up a
commission to resolve the crisis, Interfax said.
	   With no money to buy fuel oil, the city has also had to cut down
output at three heating plants.
	   Almost all apartments in Vladivostok are centrally heated by a
city-run system, and few have alternate means of heating their
homes aside from costly and dangerous electric heating devices.
	   Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, providing heat through
the winter has been a major problem for towns in Russia's Far East,
where money is scarce for fuel supplies.

Spacewalking astronauts activate first American-made space station

<TEXT>
	   SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) _ For the first time, an American
piece of the international space station is up and running in orbit
after a speedy wiring job by two spacewalkers who had time left
over for even more work.
	   ``We have successfully activated the space station,'' shuttle
commander Robert Cabana reported Monday night after electricity
began flowing from the Russian-made Zarya control module to the
American-made Unity chamber.
	   ``Outstanding effort,'' Mission Control replied.
	   The fledgling space station was brought to life after astronauts
Jerry Ross and James Newman attached 40 electrical and data cables
between Zarya and Unity during a seven-hour, 21-minute spacewalk.
	   After the wiring job, flight controllers on the ground powered
up Unity and its onboard computers while Cabana and his crew on the
shuttle Endeavour watched for any problems. There were none.
	   Unity, a cylindrical passageway to which other pieces of the
station will be attached, needs the solar power generated by Zarya
to operate. The computers, heaters and fans inside Unity began
humming for the first time in orbit once power was surging between
the two components.
	   A day earlier, the shuttle crew used a robot arm and thruster
rockets to join the two station parts, forming a 77-foot, 35-ton
tower in Endeavour's cargo bay.
	   ``Yesterday we put the skeleton together of the beginnings of
the space station. Today we hooked up the first parts of the
nervous system,'' said Bob Castle, NASA's lead flight director.
	   The astronauts had a light schedule today, including seven hours
of free time.
	   The critical wiring job, performed 240 miles above the Earth,
took less time than NASA had expected. Ross and Newman completed
the connections in just four hours, allowing them to do other tasks
such as installing hand and tool rails for future crews. They also
surveyed two antennas on the Zarya module that have failed to
deploy.
	   Two other spacewalks are planned for the 12-day flight _ on
Wednesday and Saturday _ to install communications antennas on
Unity and put tools in place for subsequent assembly missions.
	   The first spacewalk went like a well-choreographed ballet.
	   Newman unclamped the 20- to 30-foot power cables and handed
them, one at a time, to Ross to snap into place. Before locking the
connectors together, Ross inspected each end to make sure the
dozens of tiny pins inside were not bent or caked with debris. Each
connector was numbered so there would be no mistakes.
	   Ross, working from the end of Endeavour's 50-foot robot arm,
began his duties on the Unity module. He attached jumper cables
there before being hoisted more than 40 feet to Zarya, stacked on
top.
	   ``Jerry, how's the view?'' Newman called out from below.
	   ``Fantastic if I had time to look,'' Ross replied.
	   Ross and Newman had 135 tools at their disposal and engineers
standing by in two countries to offer advice. The spacewalkers tied
the most important tools to a pole that jutted from the top of the
robot arm _ a floating tool belt. Newman also strapped a set to his
waist; the tools stretched out behind him as he used a slide wire
to get from one end of the stack to the other.
	   Each man's spacesuit was equipped with a mini jetpack in case
their safety lines to the shuttle broke. Endeavour is so loaded
that it would be difficult for it to dash after a runaway
spacewalker.
	   The only bungles happened when a socket and a wire carrier were
accidentally let loose into space. However, Castle said the carrier
wasn't needed and the spacewalkers had a spare socket.
	   Newman, 42, had one earlier spacewalk to his credit. Ross, 50,
with four previous outings, became America's most experienced
spacewalker with Monday's journey _ a record 30 hours and eight
minutes in space.

Singapore Airlines says it has no plans to re-route Boeing 747
</HEADLINE>
flights

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore Airlines said Tuesday that it does
not plan to re-route flights or reduce payloads flown by its Boeing
747 jetliners, changes expected to be undertaken by some
international air carriers after U.S. aviation authorities warned
against flying the jets with dry tanks.
	   ``Following consultations with Boeing and the U.S. Federal
Aviation Administration ... we do not think it will be necessary to
change the routings or reduce payloads on any of our services,
although we are still studying the implications,'' Rick Clements,
spokesman for the flagship carrier, said in a statement.
	   The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration last week ordered
airlines with U.S.-registered jets to keep fuel in the center tanks
of Boeing 747s after discovering that fuel pumps could produce
dangerous sparks when run in a dry tank.
	   Airlines flying intercontinental routes were expected to be most
affected by the order.
	   The FAA warning applies to all U.S-registered 747s, a fleet
which numbers 246 lanes. Worldwide there are 1,087 such jumbo jets.
While FAA orders do not apply to those aircraft, foreign aviation
bodies typically follow U.S. suggestions on safety matters.
	   Singapore Airlines operates 37 Boeing 747-400 Megatop jetliners,
seven Boeing 747-400 Mega Ark freighters and five Boeing 747-300s.

China finds itself in unaccustomed second place
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Will be updated with swimming, gymnastics, other later events &QL; 
 &UR; By PHIL BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ China found itself in the unaccustomed
position of lagging behind Japan in the Asian Games gold medal
standings Tuesday as the Japanese added another gold in mountain
bicycle racing.
	   The stay in second place was likely to be only temporary,
however. Diving, swimming, gymnastics and weightlifting events
later in second-day action were expected to send Asia's dominant
sports power into the lead.
	   Akihito Udagawa's triumph in mountain bike cross-country racing,
by a nearly seven-minute margin over Thailand's Surajit Jirowong,
gave Japan its eighth gold of these games. He won in 2 hours, 5
minutes, 7 seconds.
	   China had seven after capturing the team gold medal in women's
air pistol shooting. Kazakstan's Dina Aspandiyarova edged China's
Cai Yeqing 486.8 to 486.0 for the individual title.
	   China also finished second to Kuwait, 356 to 355, in the team
event of men's skeet shooting. It was Kuwait's first gold _ and
first medal _ of these games.
	   On Monday, Japan and Thailand marked mountain biking's Asian
Games debut with golds in the women's and men's downhill races.
	   Meanwhile, Indonesian cycling coach Budi Arianto became the
first casualty among participants in these games when he crashed
into a glass door Tuesday at a building at the mountain bike
course. Budi was taken to a hospital, where he received a number of
stitches on one finger, said Pornchai Duangnate, a senior official
from the Thai Amateur Cycling Association.
	   Other news centered on withdrawals.
	   Chinese swimmer Chen Yan, world record holder for the 400-meter
medley, pulled out of the 200-meter freestyle Tuesday because of
diarrhea.
	   She was badly beaten in the 400 medley Monday by Japan's Yasuko
Tajima, and didn't swim in Tuesday's freestyle heats.
	   ``As she is rather weak now, whether she will continue to
compete in the games is still in doubt, not to say winning gold,''
said coach Han Mingyan. The 200 medley is still to come.
	   And Maldives, the Asian Games' tiniest member, departed without
being able to fulfill its very modest wish _ just one soccer
victory.
	   The team from the cluster of coral islands in the Indian Ocean
played in the preliminaries with 22 other teams, but was eliminated
without winning once.
	   ``For our nation it would have been fantastic to win just one
match,'' said Ahmed Shahir, manager of Maldives soccer team.
	   South Korea had hoped to use the Asian Games to discuss sports
links with rival North Korea, which is back after skipping the 1994
games in Hiroshima, Japan. But Culture and Tourism Minister Shin
Nak-kyun returned home from Bangkok early Tuesday without holding
talks with North Korean Sports Minister Park Myong Chul.
	   Communist North Korea has insisted that some political issues
must be solved first. It objects to South Korea's security law,
which treats the North as an enemy nation. The two sides
technically are still at war since only an armistice ended the
1950-53 Korean War.

Two police officers killed in Abkhazia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ Unidentified assailants shelled a police
vehicle in Georgia's breakaway region of Abkhazia, killing two
police officers in the separatist territory and wounding two
others, officials said Tuesday.
	   The officers came under attack on Monday in Abkhazia's restive
Ghali region, where militants who support the Georgian government
launch periodic attacks.
	   Separatist Interior Minister Amazbei Kchach blamed the attack on
the Georgian fighters, while the Georgian government denied any
involvement.
	   Abkhazia, a mostly Muslim region along the Black Sea, drove out
Georgian government troops during the 1992-1993 independence war.
Abkhazia has run its own affairs since then, refusing to allow
return of more than 300,000 ethnic Georgian refugees.
	   The province has been plagued by frequent clashes despite the
presence of Russian peacekeepers monitoring the truce since 1994.
	   The most recent attempt at peace between Georgia and Abkhazia
failed last month when Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze and
separatist leader Vladislav Ardzinba canceled talks because of
continuing disagreements.

China's Guo Jingjing wins diving gold
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Will be updated after men's platform final &QL; 
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ China's Guo Jingjing was world class
but the organization at the Asian Games pool remained far from it
Tuesday.
	   The tiny teen-age world championship silver medalist outclassed
her rivals, comfortably beating compatriot Yang Lan for the women's
3-meter springboard gold medal.
	   In a high quality contest marred by a confusing finish, Guo, 17,
ended with 547.47 points. It was a better score than Russian Yulia
Pakalhna posted to beat Guo for the gold at the world championships
in Perth this year.
	   Yang ended with silver with 510.84 points while Irina Vyguzova
of Kazakstan was third with 489.99.
	   ``I feel very good because it's my first gold medal at a major
championships,'' Guo said through an interpreter.
	   Guo, who says she ``worships'' the world's top male diver,
Dmitry Sautin of Russia, is the latest in a long line of top
quality Chinese divers and is aiming to win gold at the 2000 Sydney
Olympics.
	   ``I don't want to feel too proud about myself, but I aim to keep
improving my performance and I will be trying my best to surpass
the silver medal from the world championships at the Olympics,''
Guo said.
	   She held a lead of more than 22 points following Monday's five
compulsory dives and was steady in the optional program Tuesday.
	   Guo felt pretty comfortable, sitting down and listening to music
on her Walkman between dives, and Yang, 19, was unable to put
pressure on her compatriot. She tried a dive with a high degree of
difficulty for her ninth but messed up her entry and garnered just
56.7 points.
	   Guo replied with 65.7 for her ninth, and eased up at the finish
with a dive of 2.5 difficulty instead of her usual choice of 3.
	   While International Olympic Committee president Juan Antonio
Samaranch bestowed his usual bouquets on the games organizers
Monday, the running of the pool was still a shambles.
	   The scoreboard malfunctioned after Guo's last dive and her
points were given to another competitor.
	   After the final dive had been completed, the scoreboard showed
Vyguzova in first place.
	   Because Guo's winning score was not posted, the large crowd
failed to respond in her moment of victory. The correct result was
finally put on the board about 15 minutes after the event, while
the crowd was watching the warm-up for the men's platform event.
	   ``I didn't care,'' said Guo. ``I knew I'd won.''

Ali in final against Chong
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Born in Lancashire, England, and
playing for Pakistan, Shokat Ali won a hard-fought semifinal
against Malaysia's Ooi Chin Kay on Tuesday to clinch a place in the
Asian Games snooker singles final.
	   Ali's 6 frame to 5 victory prevented an all-Malaysian final
after Chong Tin-sam beat Hong Kong's Chan Kwok-ming 6-2 in the
other semifinal.
	   Ali, ranked 46th in the world, shouted `Yes' and pumped his fist
in the air after sinking the pink to win the final frame. Ali had
been up 3-0 early in the game but Ooi managed to claw his way back.
	   ``He'd played well,'' Ali said. ``I missed a few crucial shots
but that's snooker. I'm just glad to win.''
	   Ooi fought back tears after his close defeat.
	   The 28-year-old Ali was born in Blackburn, Lancashire, a county
in northern England where he still lives. He speaks English with a
heavy northern English accent as well as Punjabi and Urdu. His
parents are from Pakistan and he lived in Pakistan for five years.
	   Ooi and Chan had eliminated two of the favorites in earlier
rounds. Ooi beat Hong Kong's Marco Fu Ka-Chun, and Chan knocked out
Thailand's James Wattana.

 &UR; Surprise weapons inspections to begin Tuesday &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with U.N. teams going into field in Baghdad, ADDS
quotes from Iraqi officials, CHANGES dateline and byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By WAIEL FALEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ At least nine U.N. vans went into the field
in Iraq on Tuesday, the day chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard
Butler said a series of surprise visits would begin.
	   Caroline Cross, the inspectors' spokeswoman in Baghdad, did not
characterize the inspections as ``surprise,'' describing them
instead as ``their usual hard work.''
	   U.N. officials in Baghdad have been reticent to talk about their
work since it resumed Nov. 18 after the latest crisis with Iraq.
	   The Baghdad regime in August and October halted the work of the
U.N. Special Commission, which oversees the inspections. UNSCOM
must certify that Iraq has eliminated its weapons of mass
destruction before punishing U.N. trade sanctions, imposed after
Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, can be lifted.
	   The United States and Britain had threatened military action to
force Iraq to cooperate, but tension eased after Iraq on Nov. 14
announced it would allow the inspectors to resume work.
	   After the U.N. vans left the compound on the edge of Baghdad on
Tuesday, Cross told The Associated Press: ``They all have gone out
for their inspections.''
	   She added: ``Everyone is out for their usual hard work.''
	   Butler on Monday said the inspectors would begin a series of
surprise visits Tuesday in a final test of Baghdad's pledge of
cooperation.
	   The Iraqis in the past have tried to block or thwart some
no-notice inspections, calling them provocative and an infringement
on Iraq's sovereignty.
	   Butler said that after the surprise inspections are finished
late this week or early next week, he would prepare a report for
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on whether or not Iraq has kept
its Nov. 14 promise.
	   Annan then will report to the U.N. Security Council, which must
decide that Iraq is fully cooperating before it will undertake a
comprehensive review of Iraq's compliance with U.N. resolutions.
	   Iraq hopes that review will lead to lifting the sanctions _ a
move that the United States and Britain have not been willing to
guarantee.
	   On Monday, Iraq's foreign minister, Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf,
told visiting Jordanians that 39 U.S. ``commandos'' had arrived in
the guise of inspectors.
	   Iraq has long accused UNSCOM and Butler of working on behalf of
the United States to prolong the sanctions, which limit the sale of
oil and have devastated Iraq's economy.
	   Butler said the senior weapons inspector in Baghdad had informed
Iraq's National Monitoring Directorate on Monday that the surprise
inspections were about to begin.
	   The directorate, which provides escorts for the U.N. inspectors,
has been making daily announcements about their activities.
	   Its report for Monday said six U.N. teams had carried out 15
inspections. It characterized them as ``surprise visits'' and said
a helicopter was involved for at least one inspection.
	   Butler and his teams generally use the word ``surprise'' to
describe visits to previously uninspected sites. The Iraqis use the
word if the U.N. teams do not tell them in advance where they're
going, even if the visits involve previously detected weapons sites
that are under long-term U.N. monitoring.
	   Former weapons inspector Scott Ritter, in an article published
Monday by The New Republic magazine, said surprise inspections will
fail because Baghdad has had time to shift documents and materials
to new, secret locations.
	   ``Iraq has had plenty of time to shuffle the deck, to hide its
weapons to stay one or two steps ahead of the weapons inspectors,''
Ritter told a news conference on Monday.
	   ``When inspectors start carrying out no-notice inspections, they
will find nothing, and in so finding nothing they will only
reinforce Iraq's argument that there is in fact nothing in Iraq,''
he said.
	   Ritter accused Butler of working with Annan to ensure that a
comprehensive review is favorable to Baghdad.
	   ``Scott Ritter sadly is playing off a very old sheet of music,
and he's wrong,'' Butler responded.

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai police are cracking down on people
who are using fake identification cards to gain access to Asian
Games facilities, the chief of the Thai police said Tuesday.
	   ``I would like to warn people that we have the tools to detect
fake IDs,'' said the chief, Gen. Pracha Promnok.
	   ``This is an important issue, one that the Royal Thai Police
give highest priority as it jeopardizes the security of the Asian
Games,'' he said.
	   A number of food vendors have used fake identification cards to
enter the Thammasat University Sports Complex, one of the three
main competition areas for the games.
	   The cards are issued to games officials, athletes, coaches and
journalists by the Bangkok Asian Games Organizing Committee.

Indonesia says release of jailed rebel possible only if solution
</HEADLINE>
reached

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia said Tuesday it might
release a jailed rebel leader and grant amnesty to separatist
guerrillas in East Timor, but only as part of an internationally
acceptable settlement for the troubled territory.
	   In a submission to a committee in Parliament, Foreign Minister
Ali Alatas ruled out the possibility of a referendum being held to
determine the status of the former Portuguese colony.
	   Alatas' comments came a day after thousands of people rallied in
East Timor's capital, Dili, to mark the 23rd anniversary of
Indonesia's invasion of the half-island territory.
	   Rights groups say thousands of lives have been lost through
warfare against rebel guerrillas and atrocities by the Indonesian
military since the 1975 takeover.
	   Indonesia and Portugal have begun taking part in U.N.-sponsored
negotiations over the future of East Timor.
	   Alatas said he was confident an internationally acceptable
solution was possible.
	   East Timorese activists have long campaigned for the release of
rebel commander Xanana Gusmao, who is serving a 20-year sentence in
Jakarta's main prison for leading rebel attacks against Indonesian
troops.
	   ``Under the framework of a final solution, Xanana Gusmao may
possibly be released and we, the government, could possibly give
amnesty to those now in the jungle,'' Alatas said.
	   Pro-independence activists have also demanded that East Timor's
people be allowed to vote in a referendum on the future of their
homeland.
	   However, Alatas said the Indonesian government will continue to
``say no to referendum'' proposals.
	   In the past Indonesian officials have said that a ballot on
independence vote could generate bloody conflict among pro- and
anti-Indonesian East Timorese.
	   Meanwhile, Alatas said Indonesia and Portugal plan to sign an
agreement to open interest sections in friendly embassies in each
other's capitals before Jan. 31, 1999.
	   The long awaited move is regarded as a tentative step toward
normalizing relations between the two countries after ties were
severed when Indonesia invaded East Timor.
	   Alatas' comments were made about week before a U.N. envoy on
East Timor, Jamsheed Marker, was due to arrive in Indonesia.
	   Marker was expected to travel to East Timor, about 2,000
kilometers (1,200 miles) southeast of Jakarta, during his weeklong
visit.
	   Moves to reach a peaceful settlement on East Timor have gathered
pace since the resignation last May of Indonesia's former
authoritarian president, Suharto, who ordered the invasion and
tried to stamp out the rebel movement.

Scientists: Earth's radiation belt pose a risk to satellites
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With US-Space Station &QL; 
 &UR; By JOSEPH B. VERRENGIA &QC; 
 &UR; AP Science Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ The next time your cellular phone call
drowns in static or your pager won't beep, blame the Van Allen
Belts.
	   Once thought to be a slumbering cocoon of charged particles
embracing the Earth, new research shows these radiation belts can
become extremely powerful in a matter of seconds.
	   Such sudden changes pose far greater risks to orbiting
telecommunications satellites _ and even spacewalking astronauts,
scientists said Monday at a meeting of the American Geophysical
Union.
	   ``We had thought the radiation belts were a slow, lumbering
feature of Earth, but in fact they can change on a knife's edge,''
said space physicist Daniel Baker of the University of Colorado.
	   Detected 40 years ago, the doughnut-shaped particles extending
more than 20,000 miles (32,000 kilometers) around the planet were
thought to be very stable, waxing and waning over a period of
months.
	   New observations by an array of satellites show changes in the
planet's magnetic field can accelerate electrons in the belts to
nearly the speed of light, transforming them into what some
researchers describe as ``killer electrons.''
	   Under those conditions, the charged particles can pierce a sheet
of aluminum a half-inch (1.25 cm) thick, possibly resulting in a
catastrophic accumulation of particles in the sensitive electronics
of hundreds of orbiting satellites.
	   ``Many of the satellites up there now, and future spacecraft
like the space station, have the potential to be severely impaired
by light-speed electrons,'' Baker said.
	   Shielding people and hardware in space is expensive and heavy,
and the discovery may compel space engineers to design orbiting
systems differently.
	   Consumers already have experienced a taste of what can happen
when the Van Allen Belts, in the words of one researcher, ``get
whipping along.''
	   In early May, sensors on at least 10 science satellites started
picking up indications that electrons were accelerating. On May 19,
a heavily used telecommunications satellite, Galaxy 4, failed
suddenly and 45 million customers lost pager service.
	   Scientists think the electron flow contributed to the outage.
	   Such fluxes also may have contributed to the failure of a
Canadian telecommunications satellite, Anik E1, in 1996.
	   The risk to NASA's manned space program is less certain.
Satellites orbit 22,000 miles (35,000 kilometers) above the planet
in the midst of the most energetic fields of the Van Allen Belts.
	   The space shuttle and the space station orbit within about 250
miles (400 kilometers) of Earth. Scientists said that during
intense periods the charged particles pulse down into the
atmosphere.
	   Researchers said they cannot yet precisely forecast when the
belts of highly charged electrons peak in intensity, but they are
advising NASA when conditions appear to be changing so the agency
can decide whether to delay space missions.
	   ``If one of these events occurs during the space station
assembly, do you have the astronauts hurry up and risk ripping a
glove?'' said space physicist Terry Onsager of the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration. ``Or do you let the mission go as
planned?''
	   NASA plans more than two dozen spacewalks a year during the
assembly of the international space station. On Monday, astronauts
successfully hooked up electrical connections between the first two
pieces of the station.
	   Scientists expect the Van Allen Belts to become highly dynamic
beginning in late 2000 during the Solar Max _ the peak of a
cyclical period of violent storms on the sun that fill the solar
system with charged particles.

	   The Iraqis in the past have tried to block or thwart some
no-notice inspections, calling them provocative and an infringement
on Iraq's sovereignty.
	   Butler said that after the surprise inspections are finished
late this week or early next week, he would prepare a report for
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on whether or not Iraq has kept
its Nov. 14 promise.
	   Annan then will report to the U.N. Security Council, which must
decide that Iraq is fully cooperating before it will undertake a
comprehensive review of Iraq's compliance with U.N. resolutions.
	   Iraq hopes that review will lead to lifting the sanctions _ a
move that the United States and Britain have not been willing to
guarantee.
	   On Monday, Iraq's foreign minister, Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf,
told visiting Jordanians that 39 U.S. ``commandos'' had arrived in
the guise of inspectors.
	   Iraq has long accused UNSCOM and Butler of working on behalf of
the United States to prolong the sanctions, which limit the sale of
oil and have devastated Iraq's economy.
	   Butler said the senior weapons inspector in Baghdad had informed
Iraq's National Monitoring Directorate on Monday that the surprise
inspections were about to begin.
	   The directorate, which provides escorts for the U.N. inspectors,
has been making daily announcements about their activities.
	   Its report for Monday said six U.N. teams had carried out 15
inspections. It characterized them as ``surprise visits'' and said
a helicopter was involved for at least one inspection.
	   Butler and his teams generally use the word ``surprise'' to
describe visits to previously uninspected sites. The Iraqis use the
word if the U.N. teams do not tell them in advance where they're
going, even if the visits involve previously detected weapons sites
that are under long-term U.N. monitoring.

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Potential stability offered by the
formation of a new government and the surrender of Khmer Rouge
guerrillas has cleared the way for more than 35,000 refugees to
return to Cambodia, a United Nations official said on Tuesday.
	   Although there no timetable exists for the repatriation of the
refugees, their return should occur within a few months, said
Francois Fouinat, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees' regional
bureau director for Asia and the Pacific.
	   Most of the refugees fled to Thailand during Hun Sen's violent
coup against his co-prime minister, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, last
year. Several villages along the border were leveled as Ranariddh's
retreating forces fought Hun Sen's stronger army to a stalemate.
	   A second wave of Cambodians came across the border in March as
the last Khmer Rouge stronghold, at Anlong Veng, was captured by a
combined force of government troops and defecting rebel fighters.
	   Following a close election in July, Hun Sen and Ranariddh
settled their differences last month and formed a coalition
government. Hun Sen became sole prime minister and the prince was
named president of the National Assembly.
	   The Hun Sen-Ranariddh pact convinced the last divisions of the
once-fierce Khmer Rouge guerrilla army that they could not win
their war against the government in Phnom Penh.
	   Eight rebel commanders surrendered to the government last week,
effectively ending the Maoist movement's 30-year armed
insurrection.
	   Fouinat said he had met with Hun Sen and Defense Ministry
officials during his one-week visit, and that both the government
and the UNHCR agreed that the main obstacles to the refugees'
return have been removed.
	   ``Certainly there is a momentum which has been created by these
recent developments here in Cambodia,'' Fouinat said.
	   Amelia Bonifacio, director of the UNHCR border operation, said
an initial group of volunteers will be sent back to Cambodia in the
coming weeks to prove to more reluctant refugees that it is safe to
return.

WTO: hopeful signs for Hong Kong economy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: EMBARGOED by source until 1300 GMT Tuesday, Dec. 8. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Wages and other prices in Hong Kong need to fall
and the region's productivity must improve to revive its sagging
economic performance, the World Trade Organization said Tuesday.
	   But the world free-trade body was upbeat about the former
British colony's prospects in a 100-page trade policy review report
by the WTO secretariat.
	   The falling value of the U.S. dollar, to which the Hong Kong
dollar is pegged, as well as cuts in U.S. interest rates will help
boost Hong Kong's growth, it said.
	   ``This, together with its traditional adherence to a free and
open market system, should facilitate Hong Kong's emergence from
the current economic crisis and a resumption of its strong economic
performance,'' the review said.
	   ``The present economic regime may be broadly characterized by
`business as usual,''' the WTO said of Hong Kong's transition since
last year to Chinese sovereignty.
	   Although the region's gross domestic product is expected to
decline by 4 percent this year _ compared with a rise last year of
5.3 percent _ Hong Kong has refrained from moves to restrict trade
and investment, the review noted.
	   ``Wages and other prices will need to be sufficiently flexible
downwards'' given the effect on Hong Kong's competitiveness of
currency devaluations elsewhere in Asia, according to the WTO. But
it noted property prices and rents already have sharply declined in
the last year.
	   Since the Asian financial turmoil hit Hong Kong in October 1997,
its economy has suffered rising unemployment and massive lay-offs
and freezes on salaries.
	   The government announced last month that the economy slid 7
percent in the third quarter, the biggest decline since records
were kept in Hong Kong.

Flash flooding hits historic district of Singapore
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS; UPDATES with confirmation from authorities, details.

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Flash flooding has hit one of Singapore's most
historic districts as heavy monsoon rains coincided with high tides
buffeting the island republic, the meteorological department said
Tuesday.
	   Parts of Singapore's Chinatown, which has been the target of a
conservation and commercialization campaign, were inundated with
several feet of water on Monday that stopped traffic and caused
limited damage to local shops, The Straits Times newspaper
reported.
	   ``The water level rose so quickly that I didn't even have time
to clear everything,'' shop owner Lim Su Seng was quoted as saying
by the paper.
	   The flooding was caused by heavy seasonal rains falling during
early afternoon high tides, compounded by local drainage problems,
said meteorological department official Woon Shih Lai said.
	   He added, however, that there was no cause for great concern
since the problem was not widespread.
	   Many parts of low-lying Singapore suffer from occasional
flooding during monsoon rains.

Human rights report calls Malaysia a `restricted' democracy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RANJAN ROY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The first report on human rights
in Malaysia ever compiled by a local group was released Tuesday,
and it painted a dismal picture of political oppression and police
violence in the Southeast Asian nation.
	   The 258-page report described Malaysia as a ``severely
restricted democracy'' where an armory of laws provides for
``detention without trial and restrictions over basic freedoms.''
	   The report by the country's main human rights group, SUARAM or
Voice of Malaysian Peoples, comes at a time when world attention is
focused on Malaysia because of the highly-politicized trial of
former deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim.
	   But the report also praised Malaysia for achieving very high
standards of health care for its people. Life expectancy at birth
and infant mortality rates are better than those of many rich
industrialized nations, the report indicated.
	   SUARAM also complimented the government for ratifying
international covenants on ending discrimination against women and
upholding the rights of children.
	   Human rights organizations worldwide have condemned Malaysia
since Anwar appeared at a September arraignment hearing before his
trial badly bruised and with a black eye suffered from an alleged
police beating in custody.
	   Anwar faces abuse of power and sexual misconduct charges,
allegations which he says were fabricated to end a political
challenge to Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's 17-year-rule.
	   Because Tuesday's report only dealt with the human rights
situation up to 1996, it did not mention the recent firing and
arrest of Anwar, huge political rallies demanding Mahathir's
resignation or a police crackdown on Anwar's supporters.
	   But it may be revised to include these events in later editions,
the group indicated.
	   ``It sets the foundation for subsequent annual updates,'' said
Kua Kia Soong, the main author of the report.
	   The finding said 151 people died in police custody between 1980
and 1990, and that the government refused to give details about the
causes of the deaths or set up a mechanism to monitor physical
abuse of people in police custody.
	   As of late 1996, there were more than 2,000 people detained in
Malaysian jails under laws that allow imprisonment without trial,
the report said.
	   SUARAM demanded that laws such as the Internal Security Act, a
harsh detention ordinance often used against political opponents of
the government, be abrogated.
	   ``The government maintains control with a sophisticated
combination of draconian laws, controls on civil liberties, with
social and economic policies favoring elite and middle-class
sectors'' of the majority Malay community, the report said.
	   Ethnic Chinese comprise about 30 percent, and Indians about 10
percent of the 22 million population in Malaysia. The Malays are
privileged by an affirmative action system that reserves for them
school placements, jobs in the government and mandatory equity
participation in many companies.
	   Despite the quota systems, policies have not benefited poorer
Malays, yet have made many wealthy Malays even richer, the report
said. Income disparities are amongst the highest in Asia, it said.

Philippine Airlines trying to revive talks with Cathay Pacific
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES 4th-6th grafs with Cathay Pacific saying it is not
interested in resuming talks unless there are fundamental changes.

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Ailing Philippine Airlines has begun
an attempt to revive talks with prospective investor Cathay Pacific
Airways, which had earlier backed out of negotiations for a
possible controlling stake in the Philippine flag carrier, a PAL
official said Tuesday.
	   If Cathay Pacific proves unwilling to restart the talks, PAL
will consider investment offers from other foreign airlines, PAL
executive vice president Manolo Aquino said.
	   PAL closed for nearly two weeks on Sept. 23 following labor
disputes and mounting losses worsened by Asia's financial crisis.
It then began negotiations with Cathay Pacific, but the Hong Kong
carrier announced last week it was pulling out of the talks.
	   Cathay Pacific said Tuesday that it was not interested in
resuming negotiations given the current situation.
	   ``Our position has not changed since we announced the withdrawal
from talks with Philippine Airlines,'' said Quince Chong, Cathay
Pacific's manager for corporate communications in Hong Kong.
	   ``In the absence of any fundamental changes in the current
situation, we have no intention to revisit the negotiations,'' he
said.
	   Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu said the companies disagreed
over management control of PAL and the timing of Cathay Pacific's
capital infusion into the Philippine carrier.
	   Cathay Pacific wanted full management control of PAL, but the
companies were unable to agree on how to deal with a constitutional
prohibition on foreigners controlling key industries in the
Philippines.
	   Cathay Pacific also refused to put its money into PAL until
after a PAL rehabilitation plan has been approved by creditors and
Manila's corporate watchdog, the Securities and Exchange
Commission, Espiritu said.
	   PAL submitted the plan to the SEC on Monday. It calls for an
injection of dlrs 150 million in new capital, a workforce
reduction, fleet downsizing, and abandonment of unprofitable
routes.
	   The plan must be approved by the SEC and the airline's local and
foreign creditors, to whom it owes dlrs 2.1 billion.
	   If the proposed rehabilitation plan is approved, local
investors, including PAL chairman and chief stockholder Lucio Tan,
will invest dlrs 90 million of the dlrs 150 million needed by the
airline, PAL said.
	   The rest would be provided within six months by a still
undetermined ``strategic partner,'' the airline said.

China accuses Europe of blocking trade with poultry ban
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China accused Europe on Tuesday of obstructing
free trade with ``technological barriers'' by banning Chinese
poultry imports on health grounds.
	   A report by European Union inspectors in September recommended
extending a ban imposed Aug. 1, 1996, citing inadequate sanitation
at Chinese poultry farms.
	   ``The report demonstrated the motive of the European Union to
hinder normal trade by technological barriers,'' Chinese Foreign
Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said at a twice-weekly briefing.
	   EU and Chinese officials have been negotiating the dispute.
	   Zhu said China had spent hundreds of millions of yuan (dollars)
improving sanitation at its poultry farms.
	   ``China has also rectified those problems, one by one, already
pointed out by previous reports,'' he said.
	   The European Union delegation in Beijing said that only
Ambassador Endymion Wilkinson could comment on the matter. He was
out of town.

	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Italy's top tennis player, Andrea
Gaudenzi, will have to stop playing for three months because of a
torn tendon in his right shoulder, his doctor says.
	   Dr. Christian Schenk, who operated Gaudenzi on Monday, said the
rest is needed to heal the injury, the Austria Press Agency

Twenty-four victims of orphanage fire buried in Manila
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Twenty-four victims of an orphanage
fire, including 19 unidentified children, were buried Tuesday in
rows of concrete tombs at Manila's public cemetery.
	   Hundreds of people watched, some weeping, as the small coffins
were carried to the burial site. A Christmas present _ a toy _ was
placed on top of each child's coffin before the simple tombs were
sealed.
	   Only eight of the 30 people who died in the predawn fire last
Thursday in an orphanage located in a slum neighborhood of Manila
have been identified because of the severity of their burns.
	   The private orphanage also housed children of unwed mothers and
working parents.
	   ``They have to be laid to rest,'' said Marisa Balasabas, the
mother of a 1-year-old boy who remains unidentified. ``With a heavy
heart, I have to accept what happened.''
	   ``Seeing the proper name on each tomb would have made it easier
for us to pray,'' she added with regret.
	   Balasabas said the children's names will be listed on a common
marker next to the rows of concrete tombs.
	   The bodies of other victims who were identified have been taken
to their home provinces by relatives.
	   Orphanage staff members said 25 children and five adults died in
the blaze, although fire investigators have found only 28 bodies so
far in the ruble of the 85-year-old building.
	   Investigators said it may take up to 15 days before they can
conclude what caused the fire in Manila's Paco district.
	   On Friday, fire officer Romeo Almero was removed as Paco fire
station chief. No reason was given for his suspension, but local
news reports said firefighters arrived late at the scene.
	   Fire officials said the fire was not immediately reported
because of the absence of telephones in the slum neighborhood. The
first call came from someone several blocks away, they said.
	   The tragedy revived concerns about the government's
fire-fighting ability.
	   In Manila, only 15 of about 40 city fire trucks are in operating
condition. About 100 more are run by volunteer fire brigades funded
by ethnic Chinese-Filipino business groups.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese steelmakers on Tuesday slammed the
handling of a U.S. government investigation over Japan's alleged
dumping of steel products, saying they were given unfair treatment.
	   The Japan Iron and Steel Federation and the Japan Iron and Steel
Exporters' Association said in a statement the investigation was
politicized and that Japan has not been given a chance to make its
case.
	   Last month, the U.S. Commerce Department ruled there was
evidence that a surge of steel imports from Japan and Russia had
created ``critical circumstances'' for the U.S. industry.
	   This means Japanese and Russian steel makers could face
retroactive dumping duties if they are found to have actually
dumped steel. The department's preliminary decision on whether
dumping occurred is expected in mid-February.
	   In Tuesday's statement, the Japanese industry called last
month's ruling ``substantially unjustified and procedurally
unprecedented.''
	   They also charged that the department ruling was illegal because
it was entirely based on the complaints of U.S. companies and
secret contacts with them.
	   The statement urged the Commerce Department to re-examine its
procedures and reaffirm its intention to comply with U.S. law and
rules of the World Trade Organization.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's struggling economy showed isolated signs of
improvement in November but the overall outlook remains bleak, the
government said Tuesday.
	   Domestic demand for household appliances and mini-vehicles
recovered slightly, and growth in Japan's unemployment rate
appeared to be easing, the Economic Planning Agency said in its
monthly report on the economy.
	   Still, the general state of the economy remained ``extremely
severe,'' an assessment that was unchanged from the previous
month's report.
	   ``We see some bright signs here and there,'' said EPA official
Takashi Omori. ``But, on the other hand, there are things that
continue to worsen, so we're not at the point where we can say the
overall picture has started to change.''
	   The agency said that deflationary pressures in the economy
continued to cut into corporate profits, forcing continued layoffs
and cutbacks in investment.
	   Many sectors of the economy, such as department store and
supermarket sales, continued to deteriorate, the report said.
	   One of the few strong areas _ continued growth in exports _ was
being threatened as economies in the United States and Europe show
signs of faltering and protectionist pressures emerge.

which backed out of negotiations for a possible controlling stake
in the Philippine flag carrier, a PAL official said Tuesday.
	   If Cathay Pacific is unwilling to restart the talks, PAL will
consider investment offers from other foreign airlines, PAL
executive vice president Manolo Aquino said.
	   PAL closed for nearly two weeks on Sept. 23 following labor
disputes and mounting losses worsened by Asia's financial crisis.
It then began negotiations with Cathay Pacific, but the Hong Kong
carrier announced last week it was pulling out of the talks.
	   Quince Chong, Cathay Pacific's manager for corporate
communications in Hong Kong, said Tuesday that the airline is not
interested in resuming negotiations given the current situation.
	   Philippine Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu said the companies
disagreed over management control of PAL and the timing of Cathay
Pacific's capital infusion into the Philippine carrier.
	   Cathay Pacific wanted full management control of PAL but the
companies were unable to agree on how to deal with a constitutional
prohibition of foreigners controlling key industries in the
Philippines.

	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India's state-run international carrier
and the domestic airline will be controlled by a common holding
company, a step away from a possible merger to streamline
management and plug huge losses.
	   The decision was taken by the boards of Air India and the
domestic carrier Indian Airlines at a meeting in New Delhi, Press
Trust of India reported Monday.
	   The two companies together employ 52,000 employees, the Air
India Officials Union said. Spokesmen for the airlines were not
immediately available for comment.
	   Air India last month asked for a 10-billion-rupee (dlrs 238
million) government bailout as well as official help in finding a
private investor to pour in another 7.7 billion rupees (dlrs 183
billion).
	   But the Air India union predicted a merger would mean the end of
the road for the company, which faces fierce competition on
domestic routes.
	   ``If the holding company, the government and the boards decide
to merge, it will sink like the Titanic,'' Shiv Kumar,
vice-president of the union, told The Associated Press. ``Both Air
India and Indian Airlines are already in the red and are headed for
a further nosedive.''
	   Air India's management has blamed the airline's losses,
estimated at 1.47 billion rupees (dlrs 35 million) in the quarter
ending in August, on high wage bills and other ``non-operating''
costs.

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore has awarded a dlrs 15.4 million
contract to service the Southeast Asian nation's most advanced
military helicopters to an Australian firm, the Ministry of Defense
said Tuesday.
	   Bristow Helicopers Australia will begin servicing the 12
American-made Super Puma attack helicopters that the island
republic maintains at the Australian Army Aviation Center in Oakey,
Queensland.
	   The three-year contract covers maintenance, general technical
support and scheduled servicing, the statement from Singapore's
defense ministry said.
	   Singapore and Australia are both members of the Five Power
Defense Arrangement, a 27-year old military pact that also includes
Britain, Malaysia and New Zealand.
	   The two countries also participate in their own joint military
exercises, and Australia has allowed Singapore to conduct
large-scale military exercises and train fighter pilots and other
military personnel on its territory.

Police detain Chinese democracy campaigner
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Police in China raided the home of a democracy
campaigner on Tuesday, taking him into custody and seizing
literature for a planned political opposition party, a rights group
reported.
	   Zhang Baoqin was at least the ninth member of the China
Democracy Party taken into custody in a nine-day-old crackdown on
the would-be opposition group. While most have been released, three
leading organizers were still being held, having been accused of
endangering national security.
	   About 20 police officers kicked in the door to Zhang's home in
Changle city in the southeastern province of Fujian, the Hong
Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic
Movement reported.
	   Police provoked an argument with him, would not let other family
members watch and did not present arrest or search warrants, the
group said. It added that his whereabouts were not known.
	   Zhang and four other China Democracy Party supporters issued a
statement last week calling for the release of arrested party
members, the Information Center said.
	   Prosecutors are preparing to put one party leader, Wang Youcai,
on trial for subversion next week.
	   Wang's wife, Hu Jiangxia, has sent a letter on his behalf to
U.N. leaders gathering in Paris this week to celebrate the 50th
anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the
Information Center said.
	   The letter noted that by setting up a political party, Wang
wanted to raise awareness of rights.
	   Police confiscated 2,000 copies of the Universal Declaration and
the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights that he
had printed and planned to distribute, the Information Center said.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Tourists were turned away from the
Acropolis and other sites Tuesday as culture ministry employees
began a 48-hour strike.
	   Skeleton staff will remain on duty to safeguard archaeological
sites and museums _ which will remain closed until Thursday.
	   Ministry employees are protesting the merger of their social
security and pension fund with other plans. They fear the merger
could reduce the size of their pensions.
	   The pension consolidation is part of government efforts to
streamline state spending and seek entry in the European Union's
single currency group by 2001.

Kashmir general strike in third day
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By QAISER MIRZA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SRINAGAR, India (AP) _ Streets were quiet and shops and business
closed for the third day Tuesday in an anti-government strike in
the capital of Indian-held Kashmir.
	   Groups opposed to Indian rule in Kashmir had called the
three-day strike to protest a visit by Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee. Vajpayee's two-day visit, his first since taking office
earlier this year, ended Monday night.
	   As he arrived Sunday, police said explosives hidden in a public
toilet shattered windows of houses and hotels less than three
kilometers (two miles) from the state governor's guest house where
Vajpayee was staying. No one has claimed responsibility for the
blast, though it has been blamed on anti-India militants.
	   The militants say Muslim-majority Kashmir should not be part of
predominantly Hindu and officially secular India. Several groups
are fighting Indian forces, with some demanding independence and
others union with officially Islamic Pakistan. More than 15,000
people have been killed in the fighting in the last nine years.
	   India accuses neighboring Pakistan of arming and training the
militants, but Pakistan says it lends them only moral support. The
two countries have fought two wars over Kashmir in the past 51
years and still regularly skirmish across the Himalayan territory.
India controls two-thirds of Kashmir and Pakistan the rest; both
countries claim it all.
	   Vajpayee said India would never give up its claims on Kashmir.
	   ``We will not allow even an inch of our land to go ...,'' a
local news agency quoted him as telling villagers Monday in a
border area that has been heavily damaged by Pakistani shells in
the almost routine exchanges of fire between India and Pakistan.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A day after reshuffling his top staff, President
Boris Yeltsin remained hospitalized and out of sight on Tuesday.
	   The often ailing president, apparently tired of being seen as
little more than a figurehead, roused himself from his sickbed for
three hours Monday and dismissed several aides, included some who
had commented recently on Yeltsin's weakened health.
	   ``The president wanted to show who's the boss,'' said Alexander
Shokhin, leader of a pro-government faction in parliament and,
until recently, a steady Yeltsin ally. ``He's like a lion who
licked his wounds and now roared at those who thought he was
already out of the game.''
	   Yeltsin's press center said there was information on the
president's schedule Tuesday, and it appeared unlikely that he
would emerge from the hospital where he has been treated for
pneumonia since Nov. 22.
	   Presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said Monday that Yeltsin
would remain in the hospital as long as necessary to recuperate.
	   Shown on television Monday evening, Yeltsin _ who rarely seems
so robust as when he is firing someone _ appeared energized as he
scowled and delivered one of his patented tirades.
	   ``Tough discipline, order and reform is what we need,'' Yeltsin
said slowly and sternly as he glared at his staff from the head of
a long table. Aides looked down and busied themselves scribbling
notes.
	   ``You can see how vigorous I am,'' Yeltsin said, according to
Yakushkin.
	   Yeltsin sacked his presidential chief of staff Valentin
Yumashev, and three of Yumashev's deputies. A former journalist who
was the ghost-writer of Yeltsin's memoirs, Yumashev had served as
chief of staff for nearly two years _ a lengthy stay in Yeltsin's
Kremlin.
	   Gen. Nikolai Bordyuzha, 49, the secretary of the presidential
security council, was appointed the new chief of staff. Bordyuzha,
who will serve in both posts, immediately called for tackling
corruption.
	   ``Fighting corruption is very important today, including in the
upper echelons of power,'' he said in an interview with Russia's
NTV television.
	   The Kremlin shakeup dominated Tuesday's headlines in all major
Russian newspapers, many of whom said the move would energize the
presidential staff.
	   ``Yeltsin has broken away from the doctors' watch and again
shown he won't let anyone bury him,'' the liberal daily Segodnya
said.
	   Yakushkin, the president's spokesman, said Yeltsin dismissed the
aides because of their failure to stem crime and respond to several
incidents of political extremism, including anti-Semitic remarks by
a Communist parliament deputy.
	   However, the aides were primarily responsible for organizing
Yeltsin's work and handling administrative affairs inside the
Kremlin, not with issues such as fighting crime.
	   The ousters were thought to reflect Yeltsin's unhappiness over
the aides' candid remarks about the president's health. Yumashev
and others in the Kremlin have openly said that Yeltsin's ailments
left him too weak to handle day-to-day affairs.
	   ``In a situation when the presidential inner circle starts
speaking about the boss as if he were a political outsider, you
have to replace either the president, or his aides,'' the business
daily Kommersant said Tuesday. ``Yeltsin has chosen the second.''
	   Yeltsin has said and done little since the economy went into a
tailspin in August, leaving Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov to
tackle the crisis. But the president insists he will carry out his
term until it ends in 2000.

China calls on Chirac to cancel lunch with Dalai Lama
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China has called on France to withdraw an
invitation to the Dalai Lama to have lunch with French President
Jacques Chirac this week, a Chinese Foreign Ministry official said
Tuesday.
	   The exiled Tibetan leader, recipient of the 1989 Nobel Peace
Prize, was one of a group of Nobel laureates invited to meet Chirac
at festivities marking the 50th anniversary of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights.
	   ``We are opposed to a meeting by official figures in whatever
country with the Dalai Lama in whatever form,'' Chinese Foreign
Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said at a twice weekly press
briefing.
	   Zhu said China has officially conveyed that message to France.
	   Chirac tried last week to minimize diplomatic repercussions from
his invitation, saying Friday that the Dalai Lama, who lives in
exile in India, had not responded yet to his invitation.
	   France is eager to expand commercial ties with China. Chirac's
prime minister, Lionel Jospin, visited Beijing, Shanghai and Hong
Kong in September.
	   The Dalai Lama, who fled Tibet in 1959 after a failed uprising
against Chinese rule, has been campaigning for greater autonomy for
the Himalayan region.
	   Beijing says communist troops that marched into Tibet in 1950
ended tyrannical oppression by the Dalai Lama.
	   ``During his theocratic rule in Tibet, he trod cruelly upon the
basic fundamental human rights of a vast number of serfs,'' Zhu
said. ``He has no qualification whatsoever to participate in these
commemorative activities.''

Conservative sees no difference between National Front leaders
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A leading conservative politician said in an
interview published Tuesday he sees no difference between
Jean-Marie Le Pen and Bruno Megret, the two warring leaders of the
far-right National Front party.
	   ``Le Pen et Megret share the same ideology,'' Philippe Seguin,
the head of French President Jacques Chirac's Rally for the
Republic party said in an interview with the daily Le Parisien.
``For my part, I cannot tell the difference between the two.''
	   The brewing rivalry between Le Pen and his longtime lieutenant
Megret burst onto the surface this weekend.
	   And in the latest and clearest sign of serious trouble in the
National Front, one of Le Pen's loyalists openly defied him on
Monday _ and was immediately fired. Three other firings followed,
in what commentators are calling a purge of party members close to
Megret.
	   Meanwhile, Megret has called a news conference for Wednesday.
	   Also Tuesday, a conservative member of parliament, Gilles de
Robien, told LCI television he applauded ``a weakening of an
extremist party that has no business in a democracy.''
	   ``What is happening at the National Front is the destiny of all
authoritarian parties, where there is no internal democracy,'' said
de Robien, a member of the the Union for French Democracy party.
	   The National Front is virulently anti-immigrant, and has been
widely accused of racism and anti-Semitism.

Hong Kong share prices close lower
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Share prices in Hong Kong closed lower Tuesday
as investors took profits following sharp gains a day earlier.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the market's key indicator of blue chip
stocks, fell 77.74 points, or 0.7 percent, closing at 10,351.08. On
Monday, the index had surged 465.68 points, or 4.7 percent, on the
back of interest rate cuts in Hong Kong and mainland China.
	   Turnover fell to 4.98 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 638
million), down from Monday's 6.22 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S.
dlrs 797 million).
	   Brokers said investors took profits after discounting the
possibility of another interest rate cut in the near future.
	   Mervyn Davies, chairman of the Hong Kong Association of Banks,
said earlier that his association isn't likely to cut interest
rates again after doing so three times in the past three months.
	   Among property stocks, Cheung Kong fell 50 Hong Kong cents to
56.00, and Sun Hung Kai Properties fell 25 cents to 58.25.
	   In the banking sector, Hang Seng Bank fell 75 cents to 68.50,
and Bank of East Asia fell 40 cents to 14.25. Going against the
trend was HSBC Holdings, which rose 50 cents to 196.50.
	   Elsewhere, Hutchison Whampoa fell 1.00 dollar to 54.00, and
Swire Pacific ``A'' fell 80 cents to 35.50.

With oil revenues slashed, Gulf faces hard economic choices
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Tuesday's developments. No pickup &QL; 
 &UR; By ANWAR FARUQI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ Leaders of six Gulf Arab
countries, meeting Tuesday amid plunging oil prices, are trying to
hammer out a common strategy to head off a growing economic crisis.
	   The Gulf countries, which together sit on half the world's
proven oil reserves and depend on exports for 75 percent of their
revenues, also are expected to discuss spending cuts and attracting
foreign investment by ending protectionist policies.
	   Shortly before the meeting of the Gulf Cooperation Council began
Monday, January futures contracts for Brent crude _ a widely
watched benchmark _ fell to a record low of dlrs 9.92 a barrel on
the International Petroleum Exchange in London. The contracts
closed at dlrs 10.26.
	   Gulf oil generally sells at a dollar or two less than the North
Sea's Brent _ which itself was selling for around dlrs 20 a barrel
as recently as 1997.
	   The Gulf oil producers have been hard hit by the sagging prices,
which are blamed on the recession in Asia and warmer-than-usual
winters.
	   Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter and a key member
of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, is expected
to submit a proposal for a GCC economic and oil bloc that would
give the group a strong position in the international oil market,
said sources in the Saudi capital, Riyadh.
	   ``The main source of our income has been greatly shaken by the
imbalance of the oil market,'' Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Abdullah
said Monday.
	   ``Such an imbalance requires us to exert our utmost efforts
inside and outside OPEC,'' said Abdullah, who is leading the Saudi
delegation to the GCC in place of his ailing half-brother, King
Fahd.
	   The GCC groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and
the Emirates in a political, economic and defense alliance that
dates back to 1981.
	   The summit has an agenda that includes Iran's occupation of
three Emirates' islands, a proposed U.S. missile system for the
region, and a joint U.S. and British plan to overthrow Iraq's
President Saddam Hussein.
	   But oil was the main thing on everyone's mind.
	   Gulf Arab oil ministers are among the large delegations
attending the summit. GCC officials said they have been asked to
draw up a proposal on ways to boost prices on the international oil
market.
	   The Gulf producers have been grappling with widening budget
deficits and problems paying foreign debts. Saudi Arabia, for
example, had projected a dlrs 4.8 billion budget deficit for 1998,
but analysts predict it will reach dlrs 15 billion.
	   The GCC countries, long used to free spending fueled by their
oil revenues, are now having to grapple with some difficult
choices.
	   They were expected to invest up to dlrs 90 billion in major
projects in the next five years, of which dlrs 25 billion was to go
for the oil and gas sectors. Those plans may have to be scaled down
_ or shelved altogether.
	   In the defense sector alone, the Gulf Arab countries have bought
tens of billions of dollars in arms over the past decade. They were
expected to spend another dlrs 80 billion more over the next four
years.
	   Leaders at the summit have been calling for an end to
protectionist policies that have hindered foreign investments. Full
foreign ownership _ without a local partner holding the majority
share _ is not allowed anywhere in the Gulf.
	   A U.N. report last year said that foreign capital inflow to the
GCC countries was only dlrs 410 million in 1996, despite a
favorable environment. Khirbash, the Emirates' finance minister,
said this was due to restrictions on ownership and slow movement
toward privatization.
	   Abdullah on Monday called for the private sector in GCC
countries to play a more active role. But throughout the GCC, most
large corporations are state-run or owned by the ruling families.

Nicklaus ponders pairings as practice begins at Royal Melbourne
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Jack Nicklaus, while keeping his
Presidents Cup pairings under wraps, did offer one hint _ Mark
O'Meara and Tiger Woods are better friends than they were partners
in the Ryder Cup.
	   On Tuesday's bus ride over to Royal Melbourne for the first team
practice, U.S. team captain Nicklaus asked Woods about the three
matches he played with O'Meara at Valderrama last year.
	   ``He said, `We felt like oil and water. We didn't do very well.'
So probably the only thing you might find is they probably won't
play together,'' Nicklaus said.
	   ``That doesn't mean they won't,'' Nicklaus added. ``I said
probably won't.''
	   O'Meara and Woods have played countless matches against each
other at home in Orlando, Florida, and figured to be the dominant
U.S. pairing at Valderrama. But they went 1-2 in their team
matches.
	   They wound up defending themselves Tuesday.
	   ``It wasn't like we were playing all that bad,'' O'Meara said.
``Like Tiger said, these team efforts are very unique. You're
taking players out of their normal elements, and that's where the
difficulty lies. Normally, I'm out there trying to beat him, he's
out there trying to beat me.
	   ``Would we team well together? I think we would,'' O'Meara said.
``I know his game probably as well as anybody playing on our
team.''
	   Asked whether he expected to be paired with O'Meara, Woods said
only that ``it's up to the captain.''
	   Then again, the way this U.S. teams seems to mesh, it almost
seems as if Nicklaus could simply draw names out of a hat and send
them out to take on some of the blind tee shots, sloping fairways
and mounded greens of Royal Melbourne. Every American has cup
experience _ either a Presidents or a Ryder _ under his belt, and
all of them are coming off strong seasons.
	   ``Usually when there is a team, there is going to be four or
five pure rookies, and there is none on this team,'' Nicklaus said.
``I don't worry too much about that, anyway. If a guy has played
well enough to earn his right on the team, he is obviously playing
well this year.''
	   That's the Nicklaus way. He has been asked about the Presidents
Cup nearly everywhere he has been over the past six months, and
said he won't think too much about pairings until the matches near.
	   Tuesday was closer, but not close enough to reveal any secrets.
	   ``I will know on Thursday what's on my mind,'' he said. `I'm not
going to pay a whole lot of attention to it until then.''
	   Three days before the matches begin against the International
team, Woods was paired with Fred Couples, and they took money off
O'Meara and John Huston. Davis Love III went off with Justin
Leonard, while Scott Hoch was with Lee Janzen.
	   Love is back in competition for the first time since he tweaked
his back in the Shark Shootout four weeks ago. He decided to skip
the Million Dollar Challenge last week in South Africa to be sure
he was ready to go this week.
	   Love has a long history of being paired with Couples. They are
3-1 in best-ball matches in the Presidents Cup, although Couples
said he was willing to tee it up with anyone.
	   The only other hint Nicklaus revealed stems from his own
experience in the 1971 Ryder Cup when he and Dave Stockton were
paired together in an alternate-shot match. Stockton was short and
accurate off the tee, while Nicklaus was long and occasionally
wild.
	   ``I think unlike games sometimes come together, but they have a
chance of being pretty far apart,'' Nicklaus said.

South Korea, Japan to meet in 7-a-side final
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ South Korea and Japan advanced Tuesday
to the 7-a-side final of the inaugural Asian Games rugby
tournament.
	   South korea yielded an early try to Thailand, but pulled ahead
7-5 by halftime and won 28-10.
	   Japan scored two converted first-half tries for a 14-0 shutout
of Taiwan in the second semifinal.
	   International Rugby Board chairman Vernon Pugh has come to
Bangkok to watch his sport included in the Asian Games for the
first time.
	   ``If we could increase the game's profile and the number of
competitions in Asia we'd be delighted,'' Pugh said Monday at
preliminary rounds.
	   But with Japan the only Asian country assured of a place in next
year's Rugby World Cup in Wales, Pugh said there is plenty of work
to be done to promote the sport in the globe's most populous
region.
	   South Korea, which is battling for a wild card berth in the 1999
World Cup, will be Japan's main rival in the 15-a-side rugby
competition that begins Wednesday.

Paper headed by former president's daughter cleared in court
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A newspaper headed by Iran's leading woman
activist Faezeh Hashemi, the daughter of former President Hashemi
Rafsanjani, was cleared of violating press rules, the Iran News
reported Tuesday.
	   In a court hearing late Monday, Hashemi's Zan newspaper was
cleared of charges brought against it by the head of police
intelligence, the newspaper said.
	   Hashemi, who is a member of Parliament, is one of the country's
top advocates for women's rights.
	   The Iran News quoted Hashemi as saying she felt vindicated by
the court's decision.
	   The head of police intelligence, Mohammad Naqdi, last month
lodged a complaint against Zan for implying he was involved in the
September attack on Iran's Culture Minister Ataollah Mohajerani and
former Interior Minister Abdollah Nouri.
	   The paper said witnesses had seen Naqdi in street clothes at the
scene of the attack.
	   The court hearing was the latest of a series of attacks on press
freedom.
	   On Sunday the editor of the liberal Iran Farda magazine was
banned from writing and publishing activities for one year and
fined 6 million riyals (dlrs 2,000).
	   The editor, Ezatollah Sahabi, was charged with publishing
``offensive articles'' and insulting the country's armed forces
through a humiliating caricature, Hamshahri newspaper reported.
Sahabi is appealing the verdict, the paper said.
	   Hard-liners in the judiciary have shut down six publications in
recent months and detained six journalists for allegedly publishing
lies.
	   The crackdown is setting back efforts of moderate President
Mohammad Khatami, who has promoted press freedom since taking
office in August 1997.

Report: North Korea building three underground launch facilities
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS 3rd graf metric conversions; EDITS lead.
 &UR; With UN-North Korea

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ North Korea has begun developing three underground
facilities capable of launching ballistic missiles, Japan's public
broadcasting network reported Tuesday.
	   U.S. spy satellites have confirmed what appear to be three
missile-launch bases under construction in the northern part of
North Korea, NHK television quoted Japanese Defense Agency sources
as saying.
	   The three facilities are being built at varying depths ranging
from 50 meters (165 feet) to 100 meters (330 feet) below ground,
the report said.
	   Hosei Norota, Director General of Japan's Defense Agency, told a
regular news conference Tuesday that he has ``yet to receive such
information nor confirmed'' the report, an agency spokesman quoted
him as saying.
	   The report came as former U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry,
the newly appointed U.S. government policy coordinator for North
Korea, was on a three-nation Asian tour.
	   On Monday, Perry met South Korean President Kim Dae-jung in
Seoul. Kim proposed a ``package deal,'' in which the United States
would provide economic and diplomatic benefits to North Korea in
exchange for access to a suspected nuclear weapons site. Perry also
plans to visit Beijing and Tokyo this week.
	   Under a 1994 agreement with the United States, North Korea
agreed to abandon its suspected nuclear weapons program. In return,
it is to receive two safe nuclear reactors worth dlrs 4.6 billion
plus substitute fuel oil and other economic benefits.
	   The U.S. military believes it will be difficult for U.S.
intelligence satellites to monitor the North's underground missile
facilities if they are completed, NHK reported.
	   The report said a fuel storage facility will be completed in one
or two years at one of the underground sites where work is
advancing the fastest.
	   Japanese were unnerved by the firing of a rocket by North Korea
on Aug. 31. U.S. and South Korean officials say North Korea test
fired its Taepo Dong-1 missile, which flew over Japan and landed in
the Pacific Ocean, proving the communist country can strike any
part of the nation.
	   North Korea has refused to accept a U.S. demand for outside
inspections of the suspected underground nuclear facility under
construction at Keumjang-ri, 40 kilometers (25 miles) northeast of
the North's main nuclear complex at Yongbyon.
	   U.S. spy satellite photographs taken earlier this year showed
thousands of North Korean workers burrowing into a mountainside at
the site, raising suspicion that the facility may be
nuclear-related.

tennis star

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Italy's top tennis player, Andrea
Gaudenzi, will have to stop playing for three months because of a
torn tendon in his right shoulder, his doctor says.
	   Dr. Christian Schenk, who operated Gaudenzi on Monday, said the
rest is needed to heal the injury, the Austria Press Agency
reported.
	   Gaudenzi hurt himself on Friday while playing against Magnus
Norman in the Davis Cup finals in Milan against Sweden.
	   He was operated on in Schruns, a ski resort in western Austria's
Voralberg region.

Taiwan expects record drop in exports this year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwanese exports slumped 8.6 percent to
U.S. dlrs 10.44 billion in November, and the government said
Tuesday exports were expected to decline by a record 9.3 percent
for the full year.
	   Imports fell 12.6 percent to U.S. dlrs 8.86 billion in November,
and imports for the year could drop by 9.4 percent, the largest
fall since 1983, according to the Finance Ministry.
	   Largely because of the trade slump, Taiwan's economy has been
forecast to grow at 5.3 percent in 1998, down from 6.8 percent last
year.
	   Taiwan's trade surplus amounted to U.S. dlrs 1.58 billion in
November, a 20.4 percent increase from the same month last year,
the ministry said.
	   But officials said they expect trade growth to pick up next year
because the regional economy has shown signs of recovery.
	   In one signal of improved conditions, they said, the November
drop in exports was much smaller than in October, when exports
plunged 16.6 percent.
	   Exports to the United States fell 2.5 percent to U.S. dlrs 2.73
billion during November, and exports to Hong Kong slipped 16
percent to U.S. dlrs 2.35 billion, the ministry said.
	   It attributed the import decline largely to a drop in weapons
purchases from France after it had delivered the last of 60 Mirage
fighter jets Taiwan had ordered.

Paper headed by former president's daughter cleared in court
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A newspaper headed by Iran's leading woman
activist Faezeh Hashemi, the daughter of former President Hashemi
Rafsanjani, was cleared of violating press rules, the Iran News
reported Tuesday.
	   In a court hearing late Monday, Hashemi's Zan newspaper was
cleared of charges brought against it by the head of police
intelligence, the newspaper said.
	   Hashemi, who is a member of Parliament, is one of the country's
top advocates for women's rights.
	   The Iran News quoted Hashemi as saying she felt vindicated by
the court's decision.
	   The head of police intelligence, Mohammad Naqdi, last month
lodged a complaint against Zan for implying he was involved in the
September attack on Iran's Culture Minister Ataollah Mohajerani and
former Interior Minister Abdollah Nouri.
	   The paper said witnesses had seen Naqdi in street clothes at the
scene of the attack.
	   The court hearing was the latest of a series of attacks on press
freedom.
	   On Sunday the editor of the liberal Iran Farda magazine was
banned from writing and publishing activities for one year and
fined 6 million riyals (dlrs 2,000).
	   The editor, Ezatollah Sahabi, was charged with publishing
``offensive articles'' and insulting the country's armed forces
through a humiliating caricature, Hamshahri newspaper reported.
Sahabi is appealing the verdict, the paper said.
	   Hard-liners in the judiciary have shut down six publications in
recent months and detained six journalists for allegedly publishing
lies.
	   The crackdown is setting back efforts of moderate President
Mohammad Khatami, who has promoted press freedom since taking
office in August 1997.

Clashes in West Bank, Netanyahu under pressure to freeze accord
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ New clashes erupted Tuesday in the West Bank as
domestic pressure mounted on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to
abandon the Wye River land-for-security agreement with the
Palestinians.
	   The renewed violence and Israel's political turmoil came just a
days before U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit to Israel and the
Palestinian areas next week.
	   The trip was intended to shore up the Wye agreement and restore
calm to the region, but appeared to be having the opposite effect.
	   In the West Bank town of Ram just north of Jerusalem, several
dozen Palestinian high school students overturned garbage dumpsters
Tuesday and hurled stones at Israeli soldiers who responded with
tear gas and rubber bullets. Four students were injured.
	   Outside Netanyahu's office, dozens of Jewish settlers staged a
protest after assailants believed to be Palestinian militants
opened fire and wounded a West Bank settler late Monday.
	   The driver is a resident of the Ganim settlement, one of several
that became isolated enclaves after Israel withdrew troops from 2
percent of the West Bank in the first stage of the Wye agreement.
	   ``Only 17 days have passed since the withdrawal and already they
are shooting at us,'' read a sign held up by protesters outside
Netanyahu's office. Settlers opposed to an Israeli troop withdrawal
have argued that they would become easy targets for attack.
	   In a Jerusalem hospital, a 21-year-old Palestinian university
student remained hooked up to life support Tuesday after being
wounded in a clash with an Israeli civilian and soldiers.
	   The victim, Nasr Erekat, is a cousin of Palestinian negotiator
Saeb Erekat who warned that the violence would escalate if Israel
continued to hold up implementation of the peace agreement.
	   Erekat said he felt very sad and blamed Netanyahu for the
violence. ``It is the responsibility of Mr. Netanyahu's policies of
non-compliance, of surviving at any cost,'' he said.
	   Netanyahu last week suspended implementation of the Wye
agreement, charging that the Palestinians had systematically
violated the accord. Netanyahu's main complaint was that the
Palestinian Authority incited to violence against Israel in the
dispute over the release of Palestinian prisoners.
	   However, Israeli media reported that at the time, Netanyahu had
already made a deal with hard-line legislators in his coalition to
freeze the peace accord. In exchange, the hard-liners were to
withdraw their support for an early elections bill.
	   On Monday, the day of the vote, it became apparent that
Netanyahu still did not have enough support to prevent the early
elections bill from passing in the first reading.
	   In a desperate attempt to delay the vote and win last-minute
backing, Netanyahu sent Deputy Science Minister Michael Eitan to
start a filibuster.
	   However, Netanyahu's efforts failed and he was forced to have a
coalition partner, the United Torah Front, request a no-confidence
vote in his own government. The move forced a postponement of the
vote for two weeks and bought Netanyahu some time.
	   Israeli commentators were unanimous Tuesday in saying that until
the next deadline, Netanyahu will do everything in his power to win
back the hawkish renegades.
	   However, their minimal price is a written Netanyahu promise that
he will walk away from the Wye agreement for good. Netanyahu
``allowed himself to become a hostage of the right wing,''
commentator Nahum Barnea wrote Tuesday in the Yediot Ahronot daily.
	   On the other hand, Netanyahu's battle for political survival
coincides with the Clinton visit during which he will come under
intense U.S. pressure to keep his side of the peace agreement.
	   Clinton's visit was intended to calm the atmosphere and reassure
both sides. However, it appears to have achieved the opposite.
	   In recent days, the Palestinians have stepped up a campaign to
free more so-called security prisoners from Israeli jails,
apparently in hopes that Clinton will intercede on their behalf.
	   The protests and marches have triggered clashes with Israeli
troops.
	   Israel fears that by addressing a gathering of Palestinian
leaders and legislators in Gaza City next week, Clinton will
implicitly recognize Palestinian independence claims.

Unemployment up, labor office cites unseasonable cold
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ After two months of easing, Germany's
persistently high unemployment rate rose slightly in November, to
10.2 percent, the Labor Office in Nuremberg reported Tuesday.
	   Nationwide, 3.95 million people were jobless, 54,300 more than
in October, when Germany reached the lowest unemployment rate _
10.1 percent _ in two years. The seasonally-adjusted rise was far
above analysts expectations.
	   Labor Office chief Bernhard Jagoda cited unseasonably cold
weather and a slowing of jobs' creation policies that were credited
with easing the rate in September and October.
	   Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder has made tackling unemployment a
top priority of his new administration, which took office in
October. His key strategy, creating jobs through talks with unions,
industry and politicians, was launched Monday with a pledge to
lower taxes for business and improve early retirement packages to
put younger Germans to work.
	   Unemployment rose by 1 percent in both in eastern and western
Germany, to 15.9 percent in the east, and 8.8 percent in the west.
Joblessness has been most severe in the east, which is still
adjusting to a market economy after unifying with the capitalist
west in 1990.

Small plane crashes in St. Lawrence River, at least six killed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with sixth body found; ADDS details on rescue, quotes,
CORRECTS that police divers recovered bodies &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BAIE-COMEAU, Quebec (AP) _ A twin-engine plane with 10 people
aboard crashed in frigid waters near the mouth of the St. Lawrence
River. Three people were rescued, and six bodies were found in the
wreckage by police divers.
	   The search for the seventh person, who is presumed dead, was to
resume Tuesday.
	   The three survivors of the Monday crash have a sharp-eyed
6-year-old girl, her grandfather and employees of a local
helicopter company to thank.
	   Anne-Charlie Riviere spotted the partially submerged plane about
1.5 kilometers (one mile) out in the frigid water and quickly
called her mother.
	   ``Mom, give me the binoculars,'' she said. Her mother called the
child's grandfather, who phoned police to say there were people
clinging to the tail of the twin-engine Norman Islander.
	   ``If she hadn't spotted it, those guys would have been dead,''
said Roland Riviere, the grandfather.
	   Police called Heli-Manicouagan for help and the company had one
of its helicopters hovering over the downed plane within 17
minutes.
	   ``The pilot kept the plane about half a meter from the
fuselage,'' said company owner Francis Otis. Meanwhile another
employee managed to hoist one of the survivors into the helicopter.
They returned to shore with him and picked up fireman Luc
Duchesneau to help rescue the other two men.
	   The three survivors, one of whom was the pilot, survived for an
hour in the 0 degree Celsius (32 F) water while suffering
hypothermia, back fractures and shock. They were treated locally
before being flown to a Quebec City hospital where they were listed
in stable condition.
	   Doctors said that while each of the men suffered fractured
vertebrae, it does not appear that they suffered spinal cord
damage.
	   Police said the survivors and the victims were all from the
Baie-Comeau region.
	   The plane, a Britten-Norman Islander operated by a regional
company called Air Satellite, came to rest in shallow water, with
only its tail sticking above the surface. A rising tide later
covered the tail.
	   Authorities said the plane was carrying two pilots and eight
passengers.
	   The plane went down about a mile from Baie-Comeau, on the north
shore of the St. Lawrence about 180 miles (290 kilometers)
northeast of Quebec City.
	   There was no immediate indication what caused the crash, but it
had been snowing before the plane took off.
	   The region was hit by freezing rain overnight Sunday and there
was speculation that ice on the wings may have played a part in the
crash. Neither police nor Air Satellite officials would comment on
the speculation.
	   The regional search-and-rescue center in Nova Scotia said it was
not aware of any emergency radio calls from the pilot prior to the
crash.
	   Richard Gagne, a Quebec provincial police spokesman, said the
plane crashed shortly after taking off from Baie-Comeau en route to
Rimouksi, on the south side of the river. The St. Lawrence is about
30 miles (48 kilometers) wide at Baie-Comeau.

India lagging behind in child education, says UNICEF
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-UNICEF-Education Crisis &QL; 
 &UR; By ASHOK SHARMA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India and its subcontinent neighbors
have the world's worst record of school attendance with 40 million
children in India alone having never been in a classroom.
	   The number of illiterates is growing daily, said a UNICEF report
released Tuesday.
	   Despite its dismal record, India has had some successes. In the
southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh, a private foundation has
virtually eliminated child labor in 75 villages.
	   Beginning seven years ago with 16 girls, the M. Venkatarangaiya
Foundation now has enrolled 80,000 children in government-run
schools in 500 villages, said the report from the United Nations
Children Education Fund.
	   ``The essence of the program lies in making the community accept
the idea that no child should work,'' said Shanta Sinha, a
spokesperson for the foundation.
	   By contrast, in many villages in the northern state of Bihar,
not a single girl can read or write.
	   ``India has fared poorly in providing elementary education to
children and was placed worse than sub-Saharan Africa,'' said Shiv
Kumar, a UNICEF consultant, releasing the report at a news
conference.
	   The number of illiterates in India has risen to 370 million from
250 million 40 years ago. India spends less than one-half percent
of its gross domestic product on child education, Kumar said.
	   ``South Asia has the lowest rate of enrollment in the world _
only 36 percent of the children who enter school complete the fifth
grade,'' said Alan Court, the UNICEF representative to India.
	   UNICEF says national governments are obligated to ensure basic
education. But a bill introduced last year in the Indian parliament
that would make education a fundamental right has been stalled.
	   ``There has been no effort (by the government) to revive
discussion. There has to be a much more serious public concern,''
Kumar said.
	   UNICEF launched a ``joyful learning'' model in India two years
ago that involves teaching through songs, storytelling, games and
acting. It is showing results with enrollment in the Almora region,
270 kilometers (168 miles) north of New Delhi, where school
enrollment jumped from less than 25 percent to nearly 100 percent.

U.S. Ambassador: recent market optimism in Asia unfounded
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JONATHAN DRAKE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ A senior U.S. diplomat warned Tuesday that
recent optimism buoying markets in Asia was essentially unfounded,
and urged nations in the region to continue economic and political
reforms needed to spur a full-fledged recovery in growth rates.
	   ``I see no fundamental change in Asia over the past 90 days to
justify a sustained rally in the financial markets, much less to
sustain economic growth in the years ahead,'' U.S. Ambassador to
Singapore Steven Green told a gathering of businessmen in the
Southeast Asian city-state.
	   Many Asian currencies and stock markets have rallied in recent
weeks, despite a prognosis from most economists and observers that
the regional economic downturn will continue at least into 1999.
	   ``As happy as I am for those of you who have made money and
increased your company values as a result of the recent surge in
stock prices, I do not believe that the long-term fundamental
problems of these markets are over,'' Green said.
	   Noting the rapid rise and subsequent fall in Asian markets in
the midst of the economic crisis earlier this year, Green predicted
that ``this pattern of volatility will continue for some time to
come.''
	   He attributed the recent market optimism in some Southeast Asian
countries to ``short-term money'' entering relatively small
markets.
	   For instance, he noted that the combined stock market
capitalization in Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia
totaled only dlrs 300 billion, less than the market value of a
single large blue chip stock on the New York Stock Exchange.
	   Green said that while some money may be flowing into Asian
financial markets at the moment, other private capital continues to
flow out. He argued that more direct investment and loans to the
region were absolutely necessary for any return to sustained growth
in Asia.
	   ``While investors are reputed to have short memories, I have a
feeling that the bankers who have lost billions in Asia over the
past year are not going to forget the lessons of this crisis any
time soon,'' he said.
	   He said U.S. bank executives have told him recently that the
lending market for Asia remains virtually suspended, and that most
American companies considering the purchase of Asian businesses as
mere ``window shopping.''
	   ``Investors _ both creditors and equity investors _ cannot deal
with the level of uncertainty that now exists in most of the
countries in the region.'
	   Fundamental changes were required before long-term investors
would return, he said.
	   Asia needs to press ahead with political and economic reforms
that will ensure ``greater transparency, proper bankruptcy laws,
and an honest and effective judicial system.''
	   Unfortunately, many governments in the region seem more
concerned with bolstering their political positions than pursuing
painful reforms, said Green in answer to a question after his
speech.
	   ``A lot of the resistance to financial reform is actually
resistance to political reform,'' he said.

Swiss judge issues arrest warrant for Videla
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ A Swiss judge has issued an international arrest
warrant for former Argentine president Jorge Rafael Videla, the
Geneva state prosecutor said Tuesday.
	   Geneva investigating judge Christine Junod requested the arrest
in connection with the 1977 disappearance of a Swiss-Chilean
student in the Argentine capital, Buenos Aires, Bernard Bertossa
said.
	   The case of Alexis Jaccard already has led to Switzerland
formally requesting the extradition from Britain of former Chilean
dictator Augusto Pinochet.
	   ``Mr. Pinochet is obviously not the only person responsible for
Alexis Jaccard's disappearance,'' Bertossa said.
	   There is no prospect of an extradition request in Videla's case,
but the arrest warrant was issued in case Videla is able to leave
Argentina, he added.
	   Born in Chile in 1952, Jaccard was arrested during the coup that
brought Pinochet to power in 1973. He fled to Argentina and on to
Switzerland after being released from prison the following year.
	   Jaccard studied at the University of Geneva before returning to
Argentina in 1977.
	   Following a criminal complaint filed in Geneva by Jaccard's
widow, Switzerland requested Pinochet's arrest with a view to
extradition on charges of murder, kidnapping and torture.
	   Last month, Switzerland launched an inquiry into the role of its
embassy in Argentina in Jaccard's disappearance. Swiss authorities
requested Argentina to provide all the information it has on the
case.
	   In June, Videla, who seized power in a 1976 coup, was arrested
in Argentina on suspicion of ordering the kidnapping of children
born to parents who were killed during the dictatorship. He was
also charged with falsifying identity documents.
	   An Argentine government report says more than 9,000 people
disappeared between 1976-83 when the military cracked down on
leftists and political dissidents. Rights groups put the figure
closer to 30,000.
	   Although democracy was restored in 1983, President Carlos
Menem's pardon of all middle-ranking and senior officers in 1990
has left an uneasy relationship between the military and the
general population.
	   Videla's detention revealed one loophole in the pardon, which
does not include child kidnapping.

Asian Games await 33-year-old Indian mother running her last races
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo Planned &QL; 
 &UR; By DILIP GANGULY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The Asian Games on Tuesday awaited
sprinter P.T. Usha, the 33-year-old mother from India who will run
her last races in an international meet.
	   ``I am really looking forward to talking to her, getting a few
tips,'' said Susantika Jayasinghe of Sri Lanka, 10 years younger.
	   Fellow athletes view Usha not merely as a competitor, but
someone who can inspire others.
	   ``She is not only a great runner, but very brave,'' said
Jayasinghe, a runner who herself is fighting odds to return to
track honors after a drug abuse scandal that has nearly ruined her
career.
	   Twenty years ago, Usha, then a shy, 13-year-old in pigtails,
arrived on the Indian athletic scene. Today, the railroad public
relations official is the only Indian to boost of an Asian Games
gold in track and field since 1986.
	   For these games, she has missed a crucial part of her training
due to a heel injury. In addition, in a November meet in the
eastern city of Calcutta, she strained her right hamstring,
collapsing in the 200 meters.
	   In Bangkok, Usha may run only in her favorite 400 meters, since
endurance is not among her problems.
	   In the 200, even at her best, Usha would find it difficult to
beat the Chinese.
	   ``My preparations have been geared toward 400 meters,'' Usha,
mother of a 6-year-old son Ujwal, meaning radiant in the Hindi
language, said in a recent interview.
	   Usha has been India's most unpredictable athlete.
	   Taking everyone by surprise, she came out of her self-imposed
eight years of retirement to run in the Asian Track Championships
in Fukuoka, Japan, in July.
	   She was third, in 23.46 seconds, in the 200m. The same day, she
anchored India's victorious 4 x 100-meter relay. Usha also anchored
India's silver medal team in the 4 x 400, which finished .16
seconds behind China.
	   Usha has been unusual in India, where the question has been
raised whether the country of 980 million people is a ``sleeping
giant'' of sports, or whether there is something basically wrong
that prevents development of very few athletes of international
standard.
	   No Indian has won a track and field medal in the Olympics, but
Usha came closest, missing bronze by 0.01 seconds in the 400-meter
hurdles at the 1994 games.
	   Through Usha made her mark in 1978 in an under-14 Indian
National Athletic Championship, her prominence spread in 1982, when
she won silver at 100 and 200 meters in the New Delhi Asian Games.
One year later, she won gold in the 400 in the Asian championships
in Kuwait and a silver in the 200.
	   One year after starting her first retirement from sports in
1991, she married Sreenivasan, a sportsman in his own right. He
plays the Indian sport of kabaddi.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) - At least 2,000 chanting students on
Tuesday staged a string of protests around Indonesia's capital city
to press their demand that former President Suharto be put on
trial.
	   Separate bands of activists rallied near Parliament and outside
the police headquarters and the attorney general's office, while
riot police blocked one group trying to march to Suharto's house.
	   ``Hang Suharto,'' shouted students who have demanded for months
that the 77-year-old former army general be charged with corruption
and human rights abuses. After 32 years of authoritarian rule, he
quit in May amid civil unrest and political turmoil.
	   The demonstrations tied up traffic around the capital of 11
million people and security forces closed off roads near the palace
of Suharto's successor and onetime protege, President B.J. Habibie.
	   About 300 students rallied outside the Jakarta police
headquarters to protest the early morning arrest of two students
during a police raid at Indonesian Christian University.
	   The detainees were suspected of involvement in the abduction of
a plainclothes officer at a demonstration on Nov. 27. The officer
was taken away in a taxi, roughed up and released several hours
later.
	   Student demonstrators who helped oust Suharto say Habibie has
been shirking his pledge to investigate the former president, who
was scheduled to appear Wednesday for questioning at the office of
Attorney General Andi Mohammad Ghalib.
	   Some students who gathered there shook the locked gates to the
compound, which was occupied by protesters for one day last month.
Police and soldiers stood nearby but did not intervene.
	   Inside, prosecutors questioned Tunky Ariwibowo, a former trade
and industry minister who has been accused of providing perks that
enriched the business empires of Suharto's children.
	   Tunky was asked about his role in a so-called ``national car''
project, through which Suharto's son, Hutomo Mandala Putra, was
licensed to import cars from Korea's Kia Motors Corp. without
having to pay import tariffs.
	   Habibie, a former research and technology minister, has
implemented various political reforms and pledged to fight
government graft that thrived under Suharto, whose wealth was
estimated by Forbes magazine at dlrs 4 billion.
	   But critics say Habibie, whose family owns dozens of businesses,
has not moved fast enough on democratic change and has been too
compromised by his links to the old regime to wipe out corruption
that contributed to Indonesia's current economic crisis.
	   Ghalib questioned Suharto several months ago during an earlier
investigation that failed to find any evidence against the former
president. Students said it was a whitewash.
	   The Southeast Asian nation of 202 million people is beset by
high unemployment and inflation, as well as sporadic riots and
student protests for swifter political reforms.
	   Also Tuesday, The Jakarta Post reported that corrupt practices
have cost the country 1.7 trillion rupiah (dlrs 225 million) in
lost revenues since Habibie took office.
	   The losses were primarily in the departments of mines and
energy, public works, culture and education and transportation, the
Post said. It cited Soedarjono, head of the government's internal
audit department.

Clashes in West Bank, Netanyahu under pressure to freeze accord
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ New clashes erupted Tuesday in the West Bank as
domestic pressure mounted on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to
abandon the Wye River land-for-security agreement with the
Palestinians.
	   The renewed violence and Israel's political turmoil came just
days before U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit to Israel and the
Palestinian areas next week.
	   The trip was intended to shore up the Wye agreement and restore
calm to the region, but appeared to be having the opposite effect.
	   In the West Bank town of Ram just north of Jerusalem, several
dozen Palestinian high school students overturned garbage dumpsters
Tuesday and hurled stones at Israeli soldiers who responded with
tear gas and rubber bullets. Four students were injured.
	   Outside Netanyahu's office, dozens of Jewish settlers staged a
protest after assailants believed to be Palestinian militants
opened fire and wounded a West Bank settler late Monday.
	   The driver is a resident of the Ganim settlement, one of several
that became isolated enclaves after Israel withdrew troops from 2
percent of the West Bank in the first stage of the Wye agreement.
	   ``Only 17 days have passed since the withdrawal and already they
are shooting at us,'' read a sign held up by protesters outside
Netanyahu's office. Settlers opposed to an Israeli troop withdrawal
have argued that they would become easy targets for attack.
	   In a Jerusalem hospital, a 21-year-old Palestinian university
student remained hooked up to life support Tuesday after being
wounded in a clash with an Israeli civilian and soldiers.
	   The victim, Nasr Erekat, is a cousin of Palestinian negotiator
Saeb Erekat who warned that the violence would escalate if Israel
continued to hold up implementation of the peace agreement.
	   Erekat said he felt very sad and blamed Netanyahu for the
violence. ``It is the responsibility of Mr. Netanyahu's policies of
non-compliance, of surviving at any cost,'' he said.
	   Netanyahu last week suspended implementation of the Wye
agreement, charging that the Palestinians had systematically
violated the accord. Netanyahu's main complaint was that the
Palestinian Authority incited violence against Israel in the
dispute over the release of Palestinian prisoners.
	   However, Israeli media reported that at the time, Netanyahu had
already made a deal with hard-line legislators in his coalition to
freeze the peace accord. In exchange, the hard-liners were to
withdraw their support for an early elections bill.
	   On Monday, the day of the vote, it became apparent that
Netanyahu still did not have enough support to prevent the early
elections bill from passing in the first reading.
	   In a desperate attempt to delay the vote and win last-minute
backing, Netanyahu sent Deputy Science Minister Michael Eitan to
start a filibuster.
	   However, Netanyahu's efforts failed and he was forced to have a
coalition partner, the United Torah Front, request a no-confidence
vote in his own government. The move forced a postponement of the
vote for two weeks and bought Netanyahu some time.
	   Israeli commentators were unanimous Tuesday in saying that until
the next deadline, Netanyahu will do everything in his power to win
back the hawkish renegades.
	   However, their minimal price is a written Netanyahu promise that
he will walk away from the Wye agreement for good. Netanyahu
``allowed himself to become a hostage of the right wing,''
commentator Nahum Barnea wrote Tuesday in the Yediot Ahronot daily.
	   On the other hand, Netanyahu's battle for political survival
coincides with the Clinton visit during which he will come under
intense U.S. pressure to keep his side of the peace agreement.
	   Israel fears that by addressing a gathering of Palestinian
leaders and legislators in Gaza City next week, Clinton will
implicitly recognize Palestinian independence claims.

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - NATO foreign ministers began the
process Tuesday of revising the 16-nation alliance's strategic
concept, the military and political principles that guide the NATO
mission.
	   The ministers are laying the groundwork for the 50th anniversary
NATO summit in Washington April 24-25, where leaders are expected
to approve the alliance's strategy for the 21st century and welcome
three new members, Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, into the
fold.
	   ``One of the special qualities of the alliance has always been
its ability to react flexibly to new situations,'' German Foreign
Minister Joschka Fischer told fellow ministers. ``On the eve of the
21st century we should ask ourselves if our instruments still match
the changed security environment.''
	   Today's threat is no longer a Russian tank assault across the
plains of Central Europe, but challenges from regional conflicts
like Bosnia and Kosovo, terrorism and the spread of weapons of mass
destruction. When these threats originate from outside NATO's
traditional territory of operations, the alliance must be prepared
to deal with them.
	   In practice, NATO has already adjusted to these new realities,
intervening in Bosnia, halting the humanitarian disaster in Kosovo
with the threat of air strikes, sending soldiers just across the
Kosovo border in Macedonia to rescue civilian cease-fire monitors
if needed.
	   ``Today we will be discussing the future of NATO and how we are
going to do it in the next century,'' said British Foreign Minister
Robin Cook.
	   He said though Europeans were anxious to play a greater role in
European security issues, particularly in cases where the United
States is less interested in participating, but that such a role
must work through NATO.
	   ``I want to make it clear today that what we want to see is
improvement of security in Europe and strengthening of NATO,'' Cook
said.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, writing in the
British newspaper The Financial Times, said: ``NATO's primary
mission will always remain defense against aggression. But the
founders of the alliance also distinguished between what the treaty
commits us to do and what it permits us to do.''
	   She said Bosnia and Kosovo are recent examples ``that
demonstrate NATO must act when conflicts beyond its immediate
borders affect alliance interests. NATO must find the right balance
between the centrality of NATO's collective defense missions and
responding to such crises.''
	   NATO's central mission will always be collective defense and the
concept that an attack against one member is an aggression against
all. But attacks against members now take different forms and often
originate far away.
	   Albright planned to propose at the ministerial meeting here
setting up a Center for Weapons of Mass Destruction, essentially on
how to best share and use intelligence, officials said.
	   The plan would use NATO headquarters staff under one director,
with perhaps a few extra experts, they said.
	   The Germans plan to bring up the nuclear first-strike question
later in the meeting..
	   Fischer made waves when he called on NATO last month to consider
dropping its doctrine allowing a nuclear first-strike. This
doctrine, reaffirmed as recently as last year, has always been a
part of NATO's nuclear strategy and is considered an important
aspect of deterrence.
	   ``The minister will certainly raise the issue,'' a German
diplomatic source said. ``We have to see that in the context of
arms control, arms reduction and nonproliferation.''
	   The Germans don't have much backing on the issue, however.
	   The allies were to assess the situation in Kosovo, where Serb
security forces and ethnic Albanian guerrillas clashed for seven
months. The threat of a NATO air strike stopped the fighting in
October and the cease-fire is generally holding, while American
mediator Christopher Hill attempts to firm the peace with political
agreement.
	   The ministers also were to make their six-monthly review of the
situation in Bosnia. No major reduction in the 32,000-troop level
in the NATO-led peacekeeping force is expected soon.

OAU calls for intervention in Comoros
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ The Organization of African Unity
is urging its eastern and southern member states to try and restore
peace in the Indian Ocean nation of Comoros.
	   The call came Monday after a meeting of the Central Organ of the
OAU Mechanism of Conflict Prevention and Resolution, the OAU said
in a statement.
	   It said the central organ called on the countries in the region
to ``respond positively, as a matter of urgency, to the request of
the government of the Comoros to assist in the restoration of
normalcy, peace, security and stability in Anjouan.''
	   The statement made no specific recommendations.
	   Fighting between rival groups in the separatist island erupted
Saturday and continued Monday. Some sources said between 30 and 40
people had been killed. It is unclear what triggered the fighting.
	   The OAU statement urged the factions in Anjouan to immediately
end the fighting and ``commit themselves to a peaceful solution of
the crisis.''
	   The separatists last year snubbed OAU representatives, saying
the island has no intention of being part of the federal
government.
	   The OAU supports a united Comoros.
	   The crisis broke out when Anjouan declared independence from the
republic Aug. 3, 1997 and the government on Grand Comore sent
troops to the breakaway island a month later in an abortive attempt
to put down the secession.
	   The OAU, based in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa, set Dec. 10
as the date for a national conference to reconcile separatists and
the government in the archipelago.
	   In November, 1997 the separatists prevented an OAU team of
military observers from landing on the island.

Yeltsin fires key aides during a brief break from hospital

announcement...' to UPDATE with editorial comment. No pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; With PM-Russia-Failing Yeltsin, Bjt &QL; 
 &UR; By NICK WADHAMS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin, still recovering from pneumonia,
showed little sign of venturing out of the hospital today after a
surprise foray to the Kremlin the day before to fire several top
aides.
	   The often ailing president, apparently tired of being seen as
little more than a figurehead, roused himself from his sickbed for
three hours Monday and reshuffled his staff. The dismissed aides
included some who have commented recently on Yeltsin's weakened
health.
	   ``The president wanted to show who's the boss,'' said Alexander
Shokhin, leader of the pro-government party in parliament and,
until recently, a steady Yeltsin ally. ``He's like a lion who
licked his wounds and now roared at those who thought he was
already out of the game.''
	   Though Yeltsin's press center said no information was available
on the president's schedule, it looked like he would not emerge
today.
	   Presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said Monday that Yeltsin
would remain in the hospital as long as necessary.
	   Shown on television Monday evening, Yeltsin _ who rarely seems
so robust as when he is firing someone _ appeared energized as he
scowled and delivered one of his patented tirades.
	   ``Tough discipline, order and reform is what we need,'' Yeltsin
said slowly and sternly as he glared at his staff from the head of
a long table. Aides looked down and busied themselves scribbling
notes.
	   ``You can see how vigorous I am,'' Yeltsin said, according to
Yakushkin.
	   Among those sacked was presidential chief of staff Valentin
Yumashev, one of Yeltsin's most loyal aides. A former journalist
who ghostwrote Yeltsin's memoirs, Yumashev had served as chief of
staff for nearly two years _ an eternity in Yeltsin's Kremlin.
	   Yeltsin also said he was personally taking charge of ``all power
ministries ... including the Justice Ministry and the tax police.''
	   ``Power ministries'' are usually defined as those related to
national defense and security. The Justice Ministry and tax police
are at the forefront of the fight against crime and corruption.
	   Yeltsin's announcement was mostly symbolic, however, since he
already wields authority over all those ministries, and the
ministers who head them were left in place.
	   Gen. Nikolai Bordyuzha, 49, the secretary of the presidential
security council, was appointed the new chief of staff. He
immediately called for tackling corruption.
	   ``Fighting corruption is very important today, including in the
upper echelons of power,'' he said in an interview with Russia's
NTV television.
	   Yakushkin said Yeltsin dismissed the aides because of their
failure to stem crime or respond to several incidents of political
extremism, including anti-Semitic remarks by a Communist parliament
deputy.
	   The ousters were thought to reflect Yeltsin's unhappiness over
the aides' candid remarks about the president's health. Yumashev
and others in the Kremlin have openly said that Yeltsin's ailments
left him too weak to handle day-to-day affairs.
	   ``In a situation when the presidential inner circle starts
speaking about the boss as if he were a political outsider, you
have to replace either the president, or his aides,'' the business
daily Kommersant said Tuesday. ``Yeltsin has chosen the second.''
	   Yeltsin has said and done little since the economy went into a
tailspin in August, leaving Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov to
tackle the crisis. But the president insists he will carry out his
term until it ends in 2000.

Interior minister slams human rights groups
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egypt's interior minister, who is
responsible for internal security, has criticized human rights
groups for reports he described as ``false and baseless.''
	   The remarks by the minister, Police Gen. Habib el-Adly, were the
first by an Egyptian security official since police detained Hafez
Abu Saada, secretary-general of the Egyptian Organization for Human
Rights, on grounds he accepted an illegal foreign donation and
published false reports that damaged Egypt's image.
	   Conviction could result in a prison sentence of up to 15 years
at hard labor.
	   Hafez Abu Saada, the EOHR activist, was picked up on Dec. 1 and
released Sunday on bail.
	   He was detained for questioning after an Egyptian weekly,
Al-Osboa, alleged last month that the donation from a British
Parliament committee was a ``payment'' for an EOHR report that
accused police of arresting and torturing hundreds of Coptic
Christians in a criminal investigation in a southern Egyptian
village.
	   The government has denied the torture allegations but
transferred four policeman from the village, pending an
investigation.
	   El-Adly told a meeting of legislators from Egypt and NATO
countries that ``An essential part of the campaigns adopted by some
human rights organizations is false and baseless.''
	   El-Adly defended Egyptian police practices in the country's
fight against Islamic extremists as ``exceptional measures'' taken
``within the framework of legitimacy and public interest.''
	   Measures taken ``to face an exceptional danger cannot be
described as violation of human rights,'' he said.
	   Egyptian security has worked hard to contain a campaign of
violence by Muslim extremists who are trying to overthrow Egypt's
secular government and replace it with strict Islamic rule.
	   More than 1,250 people have died in the violence since the
spring of 1992, most of them police or radicals.
	   Human rights groups have come to Abu Saada's defense, declaring
his detention by Egyptian security forces as an attempt to undercut
human rights work in Egypt.
	   The government has to date refused to register a single human
rights group, forcing them to work in the precarious position of
being unregistered non-government organizations.
	   The EOHR in its report said that Egyptian police had rounded up
some 1,200 Coptic Christians El-Kusheh, a predominantly Christian
town in southern Egypt in August. It said that a number were
tortured.
	   The reports embarrassed Egypt, which already was smarting from
foreign criticism about alleged persecution of the country's
Christian minority. Christians make up about 10 percent of Egypt's
60 million people.

Russian lawmakers again stall on nuclear disarmament treaty
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's parliament on Tuesday again postponed
discussions on the START II treaty after failing to meet a deadline
for sending a related measure on nuclear weapons to President Boris
Yeltsin, a news report said.
	   The parliament's agenda setting body, the Duma Council, had
planned to review a bill outlining Russia's nuclear weapons program
on Tuesday.
	   But it delayed debate because no parliamentary factions except
the liberal Yabloko party submitted proposals or suggestions for
the measure, the Interfax news agency said.
	   Russia's Communist-led parliament has repeatedly delayed action
on the START II treaty, signed by the United States and Russia in
1993.
	   The lawmakers want an additional measure outlining the country's
nuclear weapons program before they act on the treaty.
	   The START II treaty would halve the Russian and American nuclear
arsenals to about 3,000 to 3,500 warheads each.
	   Yabloko leaders accused Communists in the parliament of once
again stalling on the treaty, which the United States Senate
ratified in 1996.
	   Yeltsin and other proponents of ratification say the missiles
that would be destroyed under START-II will soon be out of date
anyway.

Report: Jagger to send son to British boarding school
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Rolling Stone Mick Jagger wants his 14-month-old
son to be educated at an expensive British boarding school when he
reaches high school age, The Daily Telegraph reported Tuesday.
	   The newspaper said that last month Jagger and his wife, Jerry
Hall, visited Stowe, a private school in Buckinghamshire, 50 miles
(80 kms) northwest of London. The visit took place before the
latest trouble in the couple's marriage, which British tabloids say
is heading for divorce over new reports of Jagger's infidelities.
	   Boarding fees at Stowe, which has 480 boy students and 100
girls, are 4,980 pounds (dlrs 8,000) a term, the newspaper said.
Day pupil's families pay 3,600 pounds (dlrs 5,700). It was not
revealed whether Jagger's son, Gabriel Beauregard, would live at
the school or commute.
	   Jagger's 12-year-old son, James, has been registered to attend
Eton, the newspaper said. Prince William, the heir to the throne,
and his brother, Prince Harry, are students at that boarding
school, which has long been favored by Britain's aristocracy.
	   Last week, singer Michael Jackson denied reports in The Sunday
Telegraph that he planned to send his 21-month-old son, Prince, to
Stowe.

South Korean labor unions protest against more layoffs

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Hundreds of angry South Korean labor
union leaders clashed with riot police Tuesday in a protest against
plans by major conglomerates to shed workers through mergers and
swaps of their debt-ridden, overlapping subsidiaries.
	   Three hundred labor leaders traded kicks and punches with riot
police in a half-hour scuffle near the headquarters of President
Kim Dae-jung's ruling party, the National Congress for New
Politics.
	   ``Stop laying off workers!'' protesters shouted, pumping their
clenched fists into the cold winter sky. Police, wearing helmets
and holding shields interlocked in front of them, formed a human
barricade around the building.
	   The melee erupted when riot police blocked workers from pitching
a tent where union leaders were to stage a sit-down _ a potential
political embarrassment for the ruling party, which has
traditionally drawn support from labor unions.
	   Several workers were hauled off by police, but no injuries were
reported.
	   On Monday, South Korea's top five conglomerates _ Hyundai,
Samsung, Daewoo, LG and SK _ announced plans to spin off at least
130 of their 264 subsidiaries in a move to slim down, cut debts and
restore foreigners' confidence in the Korean economy.
	   Government officials said large layoffs were inevitable as part
of the deal.
	   Labor unions have called for reforms in the unwieldy industrial
groups, the top five of which employ some 500,000 workers. But they
expressed deep disappointment with the agreement on Monday.
	   Union leaders said the conglomerate owners should be held
responsible for mismanagement and donate their personal fortunes to
help reduce layoffs.
	   ``The restructuring lets conglomerate owners survive and asks
workers to be the victims,'' said a statement from the militant
Korean Confederation of Trade Unions. ``We can not accept this and
will wage an all-out struggle against the government and
conglomerates.''
	   One of the biggest reforms announced Monday was a swap of
Samsung's fledgling automobile business for Daewoo's home appliance
business, whose value was estimated by experts at dlrs 10 billion.
	   Over 3,000 Samsung Motors workers walked off their jobs in
protest for most of Tuesday. After marching around their plant in
Pusan, 330 kilometers (205 miles) southeast of Seoul, they later
returned to work.
	   Workers at Daewoo Electronics Co. also threatened a strike to
oppose the swap deal.
	   For decades, South Korea's family-controlled conglomerates,
called chaebol, thrived on cozy relations with past military
governments under a system of cross-funding and cross-loan payment
guarantees among their many subsidiaries.
	   That system allowed a single chaebol to control 40 to 60
subsidiaries, making everything from computer chips to cars, ships
and garments.
	   A restructuring of the conglomerates was a key condition of a
dlrs 58 billion bailout of the country's economy by the
International Monetary Fund last year.
	   Bankruptcies and restructuring have driven South Korea's
unemployment to a 32-year high of 7.6 percent, with 1.65 million
people out of work.

	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ The speaker of parliament was
hospitalized late Monday but was reported in stabile condition on
Tuesday morning.
	   Vlatko Pavletic, 68, was admitted to the hospital due to heart
problems, a medical team said, without elaborating. The daily
Jutarnji list said Pavletic was found to have pre-heart attack
symptoms.
	   The speaker assumes presidential duties should the president die
or become incapacitated until new elections, within 60 days.
	   President Franjo Tudjman underwent surgery in late 1996 for what
was rumored to be cancer. Tudjman denies being ill and has been
fully able to perform his duties.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with meeting starting, German, British quotes, EDITS

 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO foreign ministers Tuesday began
the process of revising the 16-nation alliance's strategic concept,
the military and political principles that guide the NATO mission.
	   The ministers are laying the groundwork for the 50th anniversary
NATO summit in Washington April 24-25, where leaders are expected
to approve the alliance's strategy for the 21st century and welcome
three new members, Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic.
	   ``One of the special qualities of the alliance has always been
its ability to react flexibly to new situations,'' German Foreign
Minister Joschka Fischer told fellow ministers. ``On the eve of the
21st century we should ask ourselves if our instruments still match
the changed security environment.''
	   Today's threat is no longer a Russian tank assault across the
plains of Central Europe, but challenges from regional conflicts
like Bosnia and Kosovo, terrorism and the spread of weapons of mass
destruction.
	   In practice, NATO has already adjusted to these new realities,
intervening in Bosnia, halting the humanitarian disaster in Kosovo
with the threat of air strikes, sending soldiers just across the
Kosovo border into Macedonia.
	   ``Today we will be discussing the future of NATO and how we are
going to do it in the next century,'' said British Foreign Minister
Robin Cook.
	   He said that Europeans were anxious to play a greater role in
European security issues, particularly in cases where the United
States is less interested in participating, but that such a role
must work through NATO.
	   ``I want to make it clear today that what we want to see is
improvement of security in Europe and strengthening of NATO,'' Cook
said.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, writing in the
British newspaper The Financial Times, said: ``NATO's primary
mission will always remain defense against aggression. But the
founders of the alliance also distinguished between what the treaty
commits us to do and what it permits us to do.''
	   She said Bosnia and Kosovo are recent examples ``that
demonstrate NATO must act when conflicts beyond its immediate
borders affect alliance interests. NATO must find the right balance
between the centrality of NATO's collective defense missions and
responding to such crises.''
	   NATO's central mission will always be collective defense and the
concept that an attack against one member is an aggression against
all. But attacks against members now take different forms and often
originate far away.
	   Albright planned to propose at the ministerial meeting a Center
for Weapons of Mass Destruction, to share and use intelligence,
officials said. The plan would use NATO headquarters staff under
one director, with perhaps a few extra experts, they said.
	   The Germans plan to bring up the nuclear first-strike question
later in the meeting.
	   Fischer made waves when he called on NATO last month to consider
dropping its doctrine allowing a nuclear first-strike. This
doctrine, reaffirmed as recently as last year, has always been a
part of NATO's nuclear strategy and is considered an important
aspect of deterrence.
	   ``The minister will certainly raise the issue,'' a German
diplomatic source said. ``We have to see that in the context of
arms control, arms reduction and nonproliferation.''
	   The Germans don't have much backing on the issue, however.
	   The allies were to assess the situation in Kosovo, where Serb
security forces and ethnic Albanian guerrillas clashed for seven
months. The threat of a NATO air strike stopped the fighting in
October and the cease-fire is generally holding, while American
mediator Christopher Hill attempts to firm the peace with political
agreement.
	   The ministers also were to make their six-monthly review of the
situation in Bosnia. No major reduction in the 32,000-troop level
in the NATO-led peacekeeping force is expected soon.

Boesak defense to ask for fraud case to be dismissed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Lawyers for former top African
National Congress official Allan Boesak said Tuesday they would
seek the dismissal of fraud charges against him after key pillars
of the prosecution's case collapsed.
	   One of Boesak's lawyers, Mike Maritz, said the defense would
submit the motion on Monday. Judge John Foxcroft postponed the
trial until then.
	   Boesak says he's innocent of any criminal wrongdoing and
expressed confidence the motion would be successful.
	   ``I feel great,'' Boesak told The Associated Press. ``We go into
this week with a lighter heart and that is always a good feeling.''
	   Boesak, a former minister who once headed the World Alliance of
Reformed Churches, is accused of embezzling a million rand (dlrs
300,000 at the time) given to his Foundation for Peace and Justice
charity. The donations came from American pop singer Paul Simon,
the Coca-Cola Foundation, Scandinavian aid agencies and other
individuals and groups. Boesak is charged with 32 counts of fraud
and theft.
	   Earlier Tuesday, the court ruled it would not hear testimony
from Simon, the last person on the state's witness list.
	   Prosecutor J.C. Gerber had hoped to present testimony from the
singer and songwriter, who had helped raise funds for the
anti-apartheid cause through concerts and records. But Simon
refused to travel to South Africa, citing his busy schedule.
	   Foxcroft rejected Gerber's appeal to either move the court to
the United States for the testimony or appoint a court official to
take the evidence in New York.
	   One of the most damaging moments for the state came on Nov. 17,
when Freddie Steenkamp, Boesak's former bookkeeper, reversed
testimony from his own trial that had fingered Boesak as a thief.
	   Steenkamp, who is serving six years for embezzlement, has
apologized for lying and said a grudge caused him to make false
charges.
	   Boesak played a prominent role in the anti-apartheid struggle
that ended in the country's first all-race elections in 1994.

Government gives money to aid homeless in cold spell
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ With the death toll from more than three
weeks of freezing weather at 91 on Tuesday, the government has
given 5 million zlotys (dlrs 1.5 million) to groups that help the
homeless.
	   Government spokesman Jaroslaw Sellin said the money from
Treasury reserves went to non-government organizations and shelters
for the homeless.
	   Most of the dead from the cold front that arrived Nov. 16 were
drunken men who passed out in the frigid conditions, police say.
Many of the victims were homeless.
	   Shelters for the homeless have been overcrowded and running low
on money. Due to the numbers seeking shelter, welfare groups have
changed their policy and taken in drunken people.
	   The lowest temperature recorded during the cold spell was minus
26 Celsius (minus 4 Fahrenheit). Temperatures have risen this week,
hovering around minus 5 Celsius (23 Fahrenheit) with steady
snowfall in several areas.
	   Police say the death toll from the cold front already far
exceeds the 54 deaths attributed to the cold last winter.

Russian hard currency reserves fall 8 percent in a month
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's hard currency reserves fell 8 percent
last month, drained by debt payments and efforts to prop up the
increasingly weak ruble, officials said Tuesday.
	   The Central Bank's reserves, which stood at dlrs 13.6 billion at
the start of November, shrank to dlrs 12.5 billion by the end of
the month, the Interfax news agency reported, quoting a bank
announcement.
	   Reserves have dropped by nearly 30 percent since the start of
the year, the bank said.
	   The Central Bank spent reserves trying to halt the steady
decline of the ruble, which is now at more than 20 to the U.S.
dollar. Before the economic crisis hit in August, the ruble was
trading at around 6 to the dollar.
	   Since Russia's financial meltdown in August, the ruble has been
closely watched as a bellwether of economic confidence in the
country. Its steady dive has reflected fears that the government
will crank up the printing presses to pay domestic and foreign
debts _ almost certain to result in high inflation.
	   The International Monetary Fund and a group of other lenders put
together a dlrs 22.6 billion bailout package last summer, but only
released around dlrs 5 billion before freezing further
installments.
	   Lenders want the government to come up with a viable budget
before resuming the loans. The IMF has criticized the earlier
government's blueprint as overly optimistic on revenues and heavy
with administrative controls over the economy.
	   After several delays, the Cabinet plans to discuss the 1999
budget on Thursday. In the past few years, the government and the
parliament have failed to finalize the budget before the new year,
further complicating the process.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ China's world championship silver
medalists Tiang Liang and Guo Jingjing produced world-class
performances Tuesday to claim the men's 10-meter platform and
women's 3-meter springboard diving golds at the Asian Games.
	   Tiang, who had a perfect 10, and Guo lived up to their world No.
2 rankings by overcoming compatriots with composed displays.
	   Tiang, 19, had been dogged throughout the competition by Huang
Qiang but nailed the gold with his ninth dive, which included the
10 from one of the seven judges. His clincher came one dive after
Huang made a mess of his ninth attempt, getting just 38.76 points
to Tian's 86.4.
	   Tiang finished off with a fine 84.66 for a final score of 657.66
and a winning margin of 83.64 over Huang (574.02), who had trailed
by less than four points after the five compulsory dives Monday.
Thailand's Suchart Pichi won bronze with 559.89 to the noisy
delight of home fans.
	   Earlier, tiny 17-year-old Guo beat China's Yang Lan for the
springboard gold medal in a high quality contest marred by a
confusing finish. Guo ended with 547.47 points _ a better score
than Russian Yulia Pakalhna posted to beat Guo for the gold at the
world championships in Perth this year.
	   Yang ended with silver with 510.84 points while Irina Vyguzova
of Kazakstan was third with 489.99.
	   ``I feel very good because it's my first gold medal at a major
championships,'' Guo said through an interpreter.
	   Guo, who says she ``worships'' the world's top male diver,
Dmitry Sautin of Russia, is the latest in a long line of top
quality Chinese divers and is aiming to win gold at the 2000 Sydney
Olympics.
	   ``I don't want to feel too proud about myself, but I aim to keep
improving my performance and I will be trying my best to surpass
the silver medal from the world championships at the Olympics,''
Guo said.
	   She held a lead of more than 22 points following Monday's five
compulsory dives and was steady in the optional program Tuesday.
	   Guo felt pretty comfortable, sitting down and listening to music
on her Walkman between dives, and Yang, 19, was unable to put
pressure on her compatriot. She tried a dive with a high degree of
difficulty for her ninth but messed up her entry and garnered just
56.7 points.
	   While International Olympic Committee president Juan Antonio
Samaranch bestowed his usual bouquets on the games organizers
Monday, the running of the pool was still a shambles.
	   The scoreboard malfunctioned after Guo's last dive and her
points were given to another competitor.
	   After the final dive had been completed, the scoreboard showed
Vyguzova in first place.
	   Because Guo's winning score was not posted, the large crowd
failed to respond in her moment of victory. The correct result was
finally put on the board about 15 minutes after the event, while
the crowd was watching the warm-up for the men's platform event.
	   ``I didn't care,'' said Guo. ``I knew I'd won.''

Opposition leader calls for ASEAN to delay Cambodia's entry
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Warning that Cambodia could prove to
be a ``headache'' for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations,
opposition leader Sam Rainsy called on the regional bloc Tuesday to
delay admitting his country as a member.
	   With a new coalition government in place after months of
political deadlock, the United Nations gave Cambodia back its seat
in the General Assembly last week, adding pressure on ASEAN members
to allow Cambodia to join.
	   But ASEAN members are split on the issue.
	   Sam Rainsy predicted that Cambodia's new coalition government
will be as unstable as the previous one that ended when Hun Sen
deposed his co-prime minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh in a violent
coup d'etat in July 1997.
	   Sam Rainsy is a staunch critic of Hun Sen.
	   Cambodia was on the verge of joining ASEAN, along with Laos and
Myanmar, at the time of the coup, but its membership was delayed
because the regional grouping did not want to be seen as endorsing
a violent power grab.
	   Following a close election in July, Hun Sen and Ranariddh
settled their differences last month. Hun Sen was named sole prime
minister in the coalition agreement and the prince became president
of the National Assembly.
	   Some of ASEAN's nine members are pushing to admit Cambodia
during the grouping's Dec. 15-16 summit in Hanoi.
	   Sam Rainsy appeared to be seizing on statements from the
Philippines, Thailand and Singapore that the new government should
prove it is stable before joining ASEAN.
	   ``If admitted this month as a full member, Cambodia is likely to
be a headache for ASEAN with looming instability compounded by a
big question mark regarding the role of the newly `defected' Khmer
Rouge forces,'' the opposition leader said.
	   The last remnants of the Khmer Rouge guerrilla army surrendered
Friday to the government, ending the radical Marxist movement's
30-year armed insurrection.
	   Sam Rainsy claimed that immediate ASEAN entry would increase
drug trafficking in Cambodia and encourage Hun Sen to ignore reform
measures he promised upon his appointment as prime minister.
	   Both King Norodom Sihanouk and Hun Sen have appealed to ASEAN to
admit Cambodia this month. The European Union, Japan, and ASEAN
members Indonesia, Vietnam and Malaysia have publicly supported
Cambodia's bid.
	   Ranariddh, who ended an alliance with Sam Rainsy when he entered
a coalition with Hun Sen, told reporters Tuesday he would lobby
ambassadors from ASEAN countries in the run-up to the Hanoi summit.
	   ``I am convinced there will be political stability,'' the prince
said after meeting with a delegation from China's Yunnan province.
	   ``I don't believe there will be more political problems,'' he
said, adding that if any developed, ASEAN would be better able to
help Cambodia resolve them if it was a member of the group.

Russian orphans get a fresh start at former county health center
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; insrwh &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) _ A century-old Marion County nursing home
slated to be torn down has been saved and now provides a roof over
the heads of 22 Russian orphans brought to Indiana from the harsh
streets of Moscow.
	   The orphans, ages 8 to 15, arrived this fall.
	   For two weeks they cleaned and painted the former Marion County
Health Care Center, which closed in 1996. The 16 boys and six girls
transformed the facility's Alzheimer's unit into suites they now
call home.
	   This is the second orphanage run by the Institute of Basic Life
Principles. The orphans came from the institute's other facility,
which is in Moscow.
	   ``The kids faced imprisonment and mental institutions,'' said
Steven S. Schneider, director of the Indianapolis Training Center
South Campus.
	   Some were juvenile delinquents before the Moscow facility took
them in, Schneider said. One boy was 5 when his father forced him
to help kill his mother.
	   Katya Lapshin and Pasha Lapshin, ages 10 and 12 respectively,
lost both parents.
	   ``My mother died because someone shot her in the head,'' said
Katya. ``My father died because he drank too much vodka.''
	   About one-third of the rambling 375,000-square-foot former
health care center will serve as the International Home for
Children orphanage. The nondenominational Institute of Basic Life
Principles out of Oak Brook, Ill., is pumping millions of dollars
into the facility.
	   And new life abounds. Children shriek with joy on the soccer
field and bicycles line the veranda.
	   The kids are learning to farm by caring for a menagerie of
sheep, goats, chickens and roosters. The farm gives the kids the
opportunity to raise animals and also helps support the facility,
Schneider said.
	   A dilapidated brick barn now is a new shop where students learn
woodworking. They're building the bunk beds and cabinets that will
furnish the training center.
	   ``We're hoping to have it done by September 1999,'' Schneider
said.
	   When completed, it will house 120 orphans from Russia and, in
the future, more from Romania.

Quakes rocks Indonesian towns, no reports of injuries

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) - Two earthquakes jolted parts of
northwestern and southeastern Indonesia on Tuesday, causing
panicked residents to run out of their homes. There were no reports
of damage or injuries.
	   A 5.5-magnitude quake which struck at 6:37 a.m. (2337 GMT
Monday) was centered offshore some 46 kilometers (29 miles)
northwest of the town of Ende, Indonesia's Meteorology and
Geophysics Agency said.
	   Ende, which lies on the island of Flores, is 1,620 kilometers
(1,000 miles) east of Jakarta, the Indonesian capital.
	   In December 1992, a magnitude-7 quake caused tidal waves that
killed at least 2,500 people and damaged thousands of buildings in
Ende and several neighboring towns.
	   Also Tuesday, a magnitude-4.6 quake was reported between the
islands of Sumatra and Mentawai at 9:55 a.m. (0255 GMT).
	   The tremor was felt in the West Sumatran provincial capital of
Padang, 1,000 kilometers (625 miles) northwest of Jakarta, the
daily Suara Pembaruan newspaper reported.
	   Indonesia, the world's largest archipelago nation, is prone to
seismic upheavals because of its location on the Pacific ``Ring of
Fire,'' a series of volcanoes and fault lines from North America
through Japan and Southeast Asia to the South Pacific.

Interior minister slams human rights groups
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egypt's interior minister, who is
responsible for internal security, has criticized human rights
groups for reports he described as ``false and baseless.''
	   The remarks by the minister, Police Gen. Habib el-Adly, were the
first by an Egyptian security official since police detained Hafez
Abu Saada, secretary-general of the Egyptian Organization for Human
Rights, on grounds he accepted an illegal foreign donation and
published false reports that damaged Egypt's image.
	   Conviction could result in a prison sentence of up to 15 years
at hard labor.
	   Hafez Abu Saada, the EOHR activist, was picked up on Dec. 1 and
released Sunday on bail.
	   He was detained for questioning after an Egyptian weekly,
Al-Osboa, alleged last month that the donation from a British
Parliament committee was a ``payment'' for an EOHR report that
accused police of arresting and torturing hundreds of Coptic
Christians in a criminal investigation in a southern Egyptian
village.
	   The government has denied the torture allegations but
transferred four policeman from the village, pending an
investigation.
	   El-Adly told a meeting of legislators from Egypt and NATO
countries that ``An essential part of the campaigns adopted by some
human rights organizations is false and baseless.''
	   El-Adly defended Egyptian police practices in the country's
fight against Islamic extremists as ``exceptional measures'' taken
``within the framework of legitimacy and public interest.''
	   Egyptian security has worked hard to contain a campaign of
violence by Muslim extremists who are trying to overthrow Egypt's
secular government and replace it with strict Islamic rule.
	   More than 1,250 people have died in the violence since the
spring of 1992, most of them police or radicals.

Radical group braces for new crackdown linked to Clinton visit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo GAZ103 &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ A white security van is discreetly
parked at the end of the unpaved street. Few pass by, and those who
do _ a veiled woman, an old man leaning on his cane _ avert their
eyes and hurry along under the watchful gaze of plainclothes
Palestinian police.
	   This is the slum home of Sheik Ahmed Yassin, the revered,
wheelchair-bound spiritual leader of the radical Islamic group
Hamas. He has been under house arrest for the past six weeks, and
with President Clinton's visit to the Gaza Strip only days away,
he's probably not going anywhere soon.
	   Hamas, already the target of an unprecedented crackdown by
Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority, is bracing for what it
expects will be a round of new arrests of its activists in advance
of next Monday's presidential visit. Its fighters are seething _
but largely silent.
	   Hamas is a bitter opponent of any peace with Israel and of the
U.S.-brokered land-for-security agreement signed Oct. 23 in
Washington.
	   Clinton's visit _ meant to help bolster the accord's faltering
prospects amid a burst of mutual Israeli-Palestinian recriminations
_ hardly sits well with Hamas, which has already staged one suicide
bombing aimed at blocking the agreement.
	   Mahmoud Zahar, a senior Hamas political leader, deplored the
upcoming visit in an interview Monday with The Associated Press,
but was careful to avoid making any threats, direct or indirect,
against the American president.
	   ``Of course we don't welcome him,'' said Zahar, a physician, who
himself was recently freed after spending several weeks in an
Arafat prison. He spoke in his sparsely furnished surgical clinic
in a Gaza slum not far from Yassin's home.
	   ``He brings nothing for us, or for any Palestinians,'' he said
of Clinton. ``He is a 100 percent supporter of Israel.''
	   Despite the denunciation, Zahar said Hamas had no plans to stage
attacks during the visit, either directed at Clinton or at Israeli
targets. That was hardly a guarantee of safety, however; the Hamas
political wing, with which Zahar is affiliated, customarily
disavows prior knowledge of violent attacks by the group's military
arm, the Izzedine al Qassam brigades.
	   ``From our side, we won't do anything,'' said Zahar. ``We don't
believe any aggression against this (visit) will serve our
purposes.'' Of Clinton, he said scornfully: ``We will leave him to
practice his tricks.''
	   The latest Arafat move against Hamas _ the Palestinian leader's
boldest drive to date against the group _ began Oct. 29, when a
Hamas-affiliated suicide bomber tried to blow up a school bus
carrying Jewish settler children in the Gaza Strip. The attack
killed an Israeli soldier riding in a military escort jeep that
managed to cut off the explosives-laden car before it hit the bus.
	   Within hours, Arafat had placed Yassin under house arrest, and
in subsequent days his police rounded up hundreds of Hamas
activists, including several senior leaders like Zahar. Some have
been freed, but many remain jailed.
	   The detention of the frail Islamic cleric, who has a devout and
volatile street following, drew a harsh response from Hamas,
including a leaflet signed by the military wing that made the most
direct threat yet against Arafat.
	   The threat was generally viewed in Palestinian security circles
as credible, possibly coming from a Hamas faction outside the
Palestinian lands.
	   Arafat, who has survived several assassination attempts, was
dismissive. ``I don't care _ it's not the first time and it won't
be the last,'' he said last month of the threats.
	   Adding to the pressure on Hamas, Palestinian police have begun a
CIA-assisted drive to confiscate illegal weapons in the Palestinian
lands, including those in the group's possession.
	   Palestinian police chief Ghazi Jabali on Monday displayed 50
Kalashnikov assault rifles that had been seized or turned in so
far. He refused to say how much of the arms cache had belonged to
Hamas, but specifically said that opposition groups _ code for
Islamic militants _ would not be spared.
	   Even before the latest crackdown, Izzedine al Qassam had already
sustained a series of blows.
	   Last March, the group's top bombmaker was found slain under
murky circumstances in the West Bank, his body dumped at the scene
of a massive car-bomb blast. In September, Adel and Imad Awadallah,
brothers and comrades in the military wing, died in a hail of
Israeli bullets in a West Bank hideout.
	   With the Wye accords signed in Washington, Palestinian security
officials promised to intensify a manhunt for top fugitive leaders
of Izzedine al Qassam in Gaza and the West Bank, in line with
security commitments under the pact.
	   Last month, media reports said Israel's Shin Bet security
service had cracked an elaborate command system under which Hamas
leaders brazenly issued orders from their jail cells for attacks
against Israeli targets.
	   Palestinian sources said another mass roundup of Hamas activists
was likely in the days leading up to Clinton's arrival. Zahar said
heatedly that such a step would be ``shameful,'' but turned cryptic
when asked how Hamas might respond.
	   ``We are going,'' he said, ``to intensify our relationship with
God.''

Opening of Israelis' spy trial postponed
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LARNACA, Cyprus (AP) _ The opening of the trial of two Israelis
accused of spying on Cyprus was postponed Tuesday at the request of
defense attorneys.
	   Defense lawyer Antis Triantafyllides asked for the delay, saying
he needed time to study a rephrasing of the espionage charges.
	   The case, which has strained relations between Cyprus and
Israel, involves two Israeli citizens, Udi Hargov, 37, and Igal
Damary, 49.
	   The judge set a new trial date of Dec. 21 and ordered that the
suspects remain in custody.
	   The men were brought to court handcuffed and under guard by
armed members of Cyprus' special anti-terrorism police squad. Both
were wearing short beards they grew in custody. Neither spoke
during Tuesday's brief proceedings.
	   The two were charged in a previous court appearance on three
counts. The government alleged that between Oct. 15 and Nov. 6,
they conspired to spy on Cyprus, conducted spying operations and
possessed radio frequency scanners without a government license.
	   The revised charges say the men conspired to spy against Cyprus
``in Israel and Cyprus.''
	   The other charges were expanded to specify that the men
allegedly ``gathered information relating to military
installations, which could possibly be useful to any other foreign
state.'' Earlier, the charges spoke about ``information useful to
another state.''
	   Triantafyllides said the alterations appear designed to make the
charges more encompassing than the original.
	   The two were arrested on Nov. 6 in the small fishing village of
Zigi, near a Cypriot army base and training area.
	   Their arrest came only three days after Israeli President Ezer
Weizman ended the first-ever visit by an Israeli head of state.
Weizman's visit was intended to ease Cyprus' concerns over Israel's
military alliance with Turkey.
	   Cyprus has been divided into a Greek Cypriot-controlled south
and a Turkish-occupied north since 1974, when Turkey invaded
following an abortive coup by supporters of union with Greece.
	   Tension has risen on the island because of threats by Turkey to
prevent the planned deployment by Cyprus of Russian S-300
antiaircraft missiles.
	   Both Israel and Turkey are known to be interested in gaining
information on the arrival of the missiles on the island, expected
in the next month or two.
	   Israel has officially denied the two arrested men were spying on
behalf of Turkey but has declined to reveal the nature of their
operations.
	   This was the third recent bungled operation by Israel's Mossad
intelligence agency. Israeli media reported that it led to the
resignation of the agency's second in command.

Perry leaves for Beijing to discuss North Korean nuclear issue
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ William Perry, the newly appointed
U.S. government policy coordinator on North Korea, left South Korea
for Beijing on Tuesday to discuss Pyongyang's suspected nuclear
weapons program with Chinese leaders.
	   Before departing Seoul, the former U.S. defense secretary held
``intensive'' consultations with President Kim Dae-jung and other
top government officials, according to a statement released by the
U.S. Embassy.
	   Perry exchanged views with Kim and sought advice from his South
Korean hosts about dealing with a suspected nuclear weapons site
under construction in North Korea, the embassy statement said.
	   Tension has mounted over North Korea's refusal of a U.S. demand
that it unconditionally open up for inspection an underground
facility suspected of being a nuclear-related site at Keumjang-ri,
40 kilometers (25 miles) northeast of the North's main nuclear
complex at Yongbyon.
	   While claiming that the facility is for civilian use only, North
Korea says it would allow a one-time inspection for dlrs 300
million in compensation. Washington has rejected the North's offer.
	   In a meeting with Perry, the South Korean president proposed
that the United States provide economic and diplomatic benefits to
North Korea in exchange for access to the suspected site.
	   After a day of consultations in Beijing, Perry will fly to
Tokyo. Perry told South Korean officials he plans to return to
Seoul after the Tokyo visit.

continued violence in Kosovo and said in a statement Tuesday that
both Serbs and ethnic Albanians in the province were to blame.
	   ``The security situation in Kosovo remains of great concern to
us,'' the ministers said.
	   ``Since the beginning of November, violent incidents provoked in
some cases by Serbian security forces and in others by armed
Kosovar elements have increased tension. These incidents show that
both the Belgrade authorities and the armed Kosovar elements have
failed to comply fully with the requirements set on in U.N.
Security Council resolutions.''
	   Hundreds of people, mostly civilians, died and hundreds of
thousands were driven from their homes in seven months of fighting
between the Serb police and armed forces and the rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army.
	   Serbia, the dominant republic in what is left of the Yugoslav
federation, withdrew Kosovo's autonomy in 1989. The ethnic Albanian
majority is now demanding independence, something the Belgrade
authorities have rejected.
	   The fighting was halted and a shaky cease-fire installed only
after NATO threatened to conduct air strikes.
	   ``We insist that both sides maintain scrupulously the cease-fire
and comply fully with the U.N. Security Council resolutions,'' the
ministers said in their declaration. ``We also expect them to
facilitate the war crimes investigations by the International
Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY). In this connection, we
deplore the denial of visas to ICTY investigators.''
	   The ministers urged all parties ``to move rapidly in a spirit of
compromise and accommodation to conclude the negotiating process.''
	   That process is being mediated by Christopher Hill, the American
ambassador to Macedonia.
	   ``We reaffirm our support for a political solution which
provides an enhanced status for Kosovo, a substantially greater
degree of autonomy and meaningful self-administration, and which
preserves the territorial integrity of (Yugoslavia), and safeguards
the human and civil rights of all inhabitants of Kosovo, whatever
their ethnic origin,'' the statement said.
	   The ministers also condemned recent actions by Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic to suppress the independent media in
Serbia.
	   The alliance said it would continue its air verification
mission, flying surveillance missions over the province, and
pledged its full cooperation to the civilian cease-fire
``verifiers'' under the direction of the 54-nation Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe.

Rebels abduct 18 people in northern Uganda
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Rebels of the Lord's Resistance Army
abducted 18 people in an attack against a camp for displaced people
in northern Uganda, a private radio station reported Tuesday.
	   The raid occurred Sunday at Anaka camp, about 260 kilometers
(160 miles) north of the Ugandan capital, Kampala, said the Central
Broadcasting Service.
	   It said about 20 heavily armed rebels forced the abductees to
carry food stolen from stocks provided by aid agencies to the
people displaced by the 11-year-war against President Yoweri
Museveni's government by the LRA.
	   More than 250,000 displaced Ugandans are camped in various parts
of the country's north and are supposed to be protected by the
army.
	   However, the military says it is impossible to adequately
protect the camps because the rebels move in small groups that are
not always easy to detect.
	   The army says large numbers of rebels have infiltrated the
country from bases in southern Sudan in recent weeks.
	   Uganda is fighting two other rebel groups in western and
northwestern regions and has sent troops in eastern Congo in an
attempt to destroy camps where Allied Democratic Forces rebels
operate from.

Hundreds gather for human rights conference in Baghdad

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Hundreds of delegates from Europe and the
Middle East gathered Tuesday for what was billed as an
international symposium on human rights in a very unlikely place _
Baghdad.
	   But at this conference, the issue was not charges by Iraqi
dissidents and Western human rights groups that Iraq's government
has detained thousands of political prisoners and tortured and
executed many.
	   The issue was the U.N. sanctions and the very visible damage
they have wrought in Iraq over the past eight years.
	   ``We hope the symposium will be able to shed more light on the
hideous crimes committed every day of the embargo that is imposed
upon our people and their human rights,'' Iraqi Foreign Minister
Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf said in opening the conference.
	   The sanctions, including an oil embargo, were imposed after Iraq
invaded Kuwait in 1990. The U.N. Security Council will only lift
them once U.N. inspectors certify that Iraq has dismantled its
weapons of mass destruction, long-range missiles and programs to
build them.
	   Iraq says 5,000 to 6,000 children die every month from hunger
and a shortage of medicines blamed on the sanctions. U.N. figures
suggest malnutrition is rampant, affecting as many as a third of
all Iraqi children.
	   Throughout the country, infrastructure is crumbling, sometimes
sending sewage into drinking water.
	   The severity of the Iraqis' plight was echoed by some in the
largely sympathetic audience, which applauded twice at the mention
of President Saddam Hussein. His picture sat next to the podium.
	   ``The first right is the right to eat,'' Gilles Muniar, general
secretary of the France-Iraq Friendship Society, said in an
interview. ``After that, it is time to admit sin.''
	   Not all the delegates avoided the irony of holding a human
rights conference in a country like Iraq, where a U.N. report this
year suggested that 1,500 people were executed in 1997.
	   George Galloway, a British parliament member and critic of the
sanctions, acknowledged that widespread abuses occurred in Iraq.
But, he said, the impact of the sanctions overshadowed them.
	   ``Compared to that, all other infringements of liberties are
almost by definition smaller,'' he said in an interview.
	   Al-Sahhaf himself skirted the question of abuses. But he argued
that human rights were used as ``a means of blackmail and political
pressure.''
	   ``Human rights have become a political weapon in the hands of
some states,'' the foreign minister said.

Asian stock markets close generally mixed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets closed mixed Tuesday, with
prices rising in Tokyo and Bangkok but falling in Hong Kong and
Taipei.
	   Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 84.71
points, or 0.58 percent, to close the day at 14,808.20. On Monday,
the average finished up 83.52 points, or 0.57 percent.
	   Share prices rose as overnight gains on Wall Street sent shares
of Japanese international blue chips higher.
	   But gains were muted as traders awaited more news on coalition
plans between the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and minority
Liberal Party, analysts said.
	   Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 119.86 yen in late
afternoon trading, up 0.90 yen from late Monday in Tokyo and also
above its late New York level of 119.81 yen overnight.
	   Thai share prices closed sharply higher as foreigners pitched
into the market, buying blue chip shares across the board, traders
said.
	   The Stock Exchange of Thailand index gained 12.64 points, or 3.7
percent, to 350.27.
	   Share prices in Hong Kong closed lower as investors took profits
following sharp gains a day earlier.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the market's key indicator of blue chip
stocks, fell 77.74 points, or 0.7 percent, closing at 10,351.08. On
Monday, the index had surged 465.68 points, or 4.7 percent, on the
back of interest rate cuts in Hong Kong and mainland China.
	   Brokers said investors took profits after discounting the
possibility of another interest rate cut in the near future.
	   Mervyn Davies, chairman of the Hong Kong Association of Banks,
said earlier that his association isn't likely to cut interest
rates again after doing so three times in the past three months.
	   Share prices in Taiwan also closed lower on profit-taking
following Monday's gains.
	   The Taipei market's key Weighted Stock Price Index fell 90.66
points, or 1.24 percent, to 7,212.68.
	   Elsewhere:
	   SINGAPORE: Share prices closed higher on expectations that
another round of interest rate cuts is imminent, dealers said. The
Straits Times Index rose 16.79 points, or 1.2 percent, to 1,393.61.
	   WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed higher as a rise in
market heavyweight Telecom Corp. of New Zealand Ltd. buoyed local
market sentiment. The benchmark NZSE-40 Capital Index rose up 7.66
points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,912.75.
	   MANILA: Philippine share prices closed lower, dragged down by
the weak performance of the property sector on renewed fears that
interest rates may increase. The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange
Index fell 18.51 points, or 1 percent, to 1,815.85.
	   SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed higher, boosted by
overnight gains on Wall Street. The All Ordinaries Index rose 15.6
points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,771.7.
	   SEOUL: Share prices closed lower on profit-taking. The Korea
Composite Index fell 4.67 points, or 0.9 percent, to 509.85.
	   KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian share prices closed lower on
profit-taking. The benchmark Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange Composite
Index fell 3.93 points, or 0.78 percent, to 510.85.
	   JAKARTA: Share prices closed lower as investors took profits
following recent gains. The Composite Index slipped 0.559 point at
398.901.

China pulls out of unaccustomed second place
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with diving golds, more shooting, cycling; will be
updated with swimming, gymnastics, other later events &QL; 
 &UR; By PHIL BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ China finished 1-2 in two diving events
Tuesday, pulling out of an unaccustomed position in the Asian Games
_ second in the gold medal standings.
	   After the first full day of medals competition Monday, China had
trailed Japan seven golds to six, and Japan won an early cycling
race Tuesday.
	   But then China bounced back with golds in men's platform and
women's springboard diving, a cycling race and a shooting
competition.
	   Ahead of an evening program that included swimming and
weightlifting, China had 10 golds to eight for Japan. South Korea
had five.
	   Host Thailand and Kazakstan each increased their count to three
golds, while Kuwait and Turkmenistan won their first of these
games, both in shooting.
	   The competition for Chinese divers Tiang Liang and Guo Jingjing,
both world championships silver medalists, came from compatriots.
	   Tiang pulled away from Huang Qiang late in the men's platform
diving. He had a perfect 10 from one of the seven judges on the
ninth of his 10 dives.
	   Guo pulled steadily ahead of Yang Lan, although the crowd didn't
share in her triumph as the scoreboard at the end showed bronze
medalist Irina Vyguzova of Kazakstan in first place.
	   ``I didn't care,'' said Guo. ``I knew I'd won.''
	   Japan's gold Tuesday came from Akihito Udagawa's triumph in
mountain bike cross-country racing, by a nearly seven-minute margin
over Thailand's Surajit Jirowong. He won in 2 hours, 5 minutes, 7
seconds.
	   Then China's Ma Yanping beat Japan's Kanako Kobayashi 2:07:28.00
to 2:11:45 for gold in the women's race.
	   While China captured the team gold medal in women's air pistol
shooting, Kazakstan's Dina Aspandiyarova edged China's Cai Yeqing
486.8 to 486.0 for the individual title.
	   China also finished second to Kuwait, 356 to 355, in the team
event of men's skeet shooting. For the individual gold, Kazakstan's
Sergy Yakshin beat Kuwait's Abdullah al-Rashidi 149 to 145.
	   Host Thailand won the men's free rifle prone shooting by beating
Kyrgyzstan 1,758 to 1,752. But Turkmenistan's Igor Pirekeev beat
Thailand's Taravit Majcharcheep 697.2 to 693.3 for the individual
gold.
	   Meanwhile, Indonesian cycling coach Budi Arianto became the
first casualty among participants in these games when he crashed
into a glass door Tuesday at a building at the mountain bike
course. Budi was taken to a hospital, where he received a number of
stitches on one finger, said Pornchai Duangnate, a senior official
from the Thai Amateur Cycling Association.
	   Other news centered on withdrawals.
	   Chinese swimmer Chen Yan, world record holder for the 400-meter
medley, pulled out of the 200-meter freestyle Tuesday because of
diarrhea.
	   She was badly beaten in the 400 medley Monday by Japan's Yasuko
Tajima, and didn't swim in Tuesday's freestyle heats.
	   ``As she is rather weak now, whether she will continue to
compete in the games is still in doubt, not to say winning gold,''
said coach Han Mingyan. The 200 medley is still to come.
	   And Maldives, the Asian Games' tiniest member, departed without
being able to fulfill its very modest wish _ just one soccer
victory.
	   The team from the cluster of coral islands in the Indian Ocean
played in the preliminaries with 22 other teams, but was eliminated
without winning once.
	   ``For our nation it would have been fantastic to win just one
match,'' said Ahmed Shahir, manager of Maldives soccer team.

Yeltsin remains hospitalized, out of public view
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW grafs 4-9 with comment from presidential spokesman,
Communist Party leader. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A day after reshuffling his top staff, President
Boris Yeltsin remained hospitalized and out of sight on Tuesday.
	   The often ailing president, apparently tired of being seen as
little more than a figurehead, roused himself from his sickbed for
three hours Monday and dismissed several aides, included some who
had commented recently on Yeltsin's weakened health.
	   ``The president wanted to show who's the boss,'' said Alexander
Shokhin, leader of a pro-government faction in parliament and,
until recently, a steady Yeltsin ally. ``He's like a lion who
licked his wounds and now roared at those who thought he was
already out of the game.''
	   Yeltsin spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said doctors allowed the
president to take brief walks around the hospital grounds Tuesday
for the first time since he was hospitalized with pneumonia on Nov.
22.
	   ``That means he is on the way to recovery,'' Yakushkin was
quoted as saying by the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Yakushkin said Yeltsin was working on documents, but had no
meetings planned and would remain hospitalized as long as necessary
to recuperate.
	   ``Pneumonia is an illness that requires a serious treatment and
a certain regime,'' he said.
	   Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov said Yeltsin's reshuffle
made no real difference for the running of the country.
	   ``He is not governing anything any longer,'' Zyuganov said of
Yeltsin. ``This is simply an agony.''
	   Shown on television Monday evening, Yeltsin appeared energized
as he scowled and delivered one of his patented tirades.
	   ``Tough discipline, order and reform is what we need,'' Yeltsin
said slowly and sternly as he glared at his staff from the head of
a long table. Aides looked down and busied themselves scribbling
notes.
	   ``You can see how vigorous I am,'' Yeltsin said, according to
Yakushkin.
	   Yeltsin sacked his presidential chief of staff Valentin
Yumashev, and three of Yumashev's deputies. A former journalist who
was the ghost-writer of Yeltsin's memoirs, Yumashev had served as
chief of staff for nearly two years _ a lengthy stay in Yeltsin's
Kremlin.
	   Gen. Nikolai Bordyuzha, 49, the secretary of the presidential
security council, was appointed the new chief of staff. Bordyuzha,
who will serve in both posts, immediately called for tackling
corruption.
	   The Kremlin shakeup dominated Tuesday's headlines in all major
Russian newspapers, many of whom said the move would energize the
presidential staff.
	   ``Yeltsin has broken away from the doctors' watch and again
shown he won't let anyone bury him,'' the liberal daily Segodnya
said.
	   Yakushkin, the president's spokesman, said Yeltsin dismissed the
aides because of their failure to stem crime and respond to several
incidents of political extremism, including anti-Semitic remarks by
a Communist parliament deputy.
	   However, the aides were primarily responsible for organizing
Yeltsin's work and handling administrative affairs inside the
Kremlin, not with issues such as fighting crime.
	   The ousters were thought to reflect Yeltsin's unhappiness over
the aides' candid remarks about the president's health. Yumashev
and others in the Kremlin have openly said that Yeltsin's ailments
left him too weak to handle day-to-day affairs.
	   ``In a situation when the presidential inner circle starts
speaking about the boss as if he were a political outsider, you
have to replace either the president, or his aides,'' the business
daily Kommersant said Tuesday. ``Yeltsin has chosen the second.''
	   Yeltsin has said and done little since the economy went into a
tailspin in August, leaving Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov to
tackle the crisis. But the president insists he will carry out his
term until it ends in 2000.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A day after reshuffling his top staff, President
Boris Yeltsin remained hospitalized and out of sight on Tuesday.
	   The often ailing president, apparently tired of being seen as
little more than a figurehead, roused himself from his sickbed for
three hours Monday and dismissed several aides, included some who
had commented recently on Yeltsin's weakened health.
	   ``The president wanted to show who's the boss,'' said Alexander
Shokhin, leader of a pro-government faction in parliament and,
until recently, a steady Yeltsin ally. ``He's like a lion who
licked his wounds and now roared at those who thought he was
already out of the game.''
	   Yeltsin spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said doctors allowed the
president to take brief walks around the hospital grounds Tuesday
for the first time since he was hospitalized with pneumonia on Nov.
22.
	   ``That means he is on the way to recovery,'' Yakushkin was
quoted as saying by the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Yakushkin said Yeltsin was working on documents, but had no
meetings planned and would remain hospitalized as long as necessary
to recuperate.
	   ``Pneumonia is an illness that requires a serious treatment and
a certain regime,'' he said.
	   Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov said Yeltsin's reshuffle
made no real difference for the running of the country.
	   ``He is not governing anything any longer,'' Zyuganov said of
Yeltsin. ``This is simply an agony.''
	   Shown on television Monday evening, Yeltsin appeared energized
as he scowled and delivered one of his patented tirades.
	   ``Tough discipline, order and reform is what we need,'' Yeltsin
said slowly and sternly as he glared at his staff from the head of
a long table. Aides looked down and busied themselves scribbling
notes.
	   ``You can see how vigorous I am,'' Yeltsin said, according to
Yakushkin.
	   Yeltsin sacked his presidential chief of staff Valentin
Yumashev, and three of Yumashev's deputies. A former journalist who
was the ghost-writer of Yeltsin's memoirs, Yumashev had served as
chief of staff for nearly two years _ a lengthy stay in Yeltsin's
Kremlin.
	   Gen. Nikolai Bordyuzha, 49, the secretary of the presidential
security council, was appointed the new chief of staff. Bordyuzha,
who will serve in both posts, immediately called for tackling
corruption.
	   The Kremlin shakeup dominated Tuesday's headlines in all major
Russian newspapers, many of whom said the move would energize the
presidential staff.
	   ``Yeltsin has broken away from the doctors' watch and again
shown he won't let anyone bury him,'' the liberal daily Segodnya
said.
	   Yakushkin, the president's spokesman, said Yeltsin dismissed the
aides because of their failure to stem crime and respond to several
incidents of political extremism, including anti-Semitic remarks by
a Communist parliament deputy.
	   However, the aides were primarily responsible for organizing
Yeltsin's work and handling administrative affairs inside the
Kremlin, not with issues such as fighting crime.
	   The ousters were thought to reflect Yeltsin's unhappiness over
the aides' candid remarks about the president's health. Yumashev
and others in the Kremlin have openly said that Yeltsin's ailments
left him too weak to handle day-to-day affairs.
	   ``In a situation when the presidential inner circle starts
speaking about the boss as if he were a political outsider, you
have to replace either the president, or his aides,'' the business
daily Kommersant said Tuesday. ``Yeltsin has chosen the second.''
	   Yeltsin has said and done little since the economy went into a
tailspin in August, leaving Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov to
tackle the crisis. But the president insists he will carry out his
term until it ends in 2000.

Hyundai chief to visit North Korea again
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ The owner of South Korea's Hyundai
business group will visit North Korea again next week to discuss
tourism and other business deals in the communist country, Hyundai
officials said Tuesday.
	   Chung Ju-yung, 84, will cross the heavily armed border at the
truce village of Panmunjom next Tuesday for his third visit to the
North this year, they said.
	   Chung visited his native North Korea with a gift of 1001 cattle
in June and October and returned home with approval for several
business deals, including a sightseeing tour of scenic Diamond
Mountain on the North's east coast.
	   About 4,400 South Koreans have been allowed to visit Diamond
Mountain by cruise ship since the tour began on Nov. 18. In return
for the right to organize the tours, Hyundai must pay North Korea
dlrs 906 million over the next six years.
	   Hyundai officials said Chung will be visiting North Korea next
week with a gift of 50 passenger cars. On his two previous visits,
he donated 100 trucks and 20 Hyundai cars worth dlrs 2.5 million.
	   During next week's visit, Chung will follow up other joint
venture projects agreed on earlier, including a thermal power
plant, a car assembly plant and an industrial park, Hyundai
officials said.
	   The sightseeing project is the largest inter-Korea joint venture
since the Korean peninsula was divided into the communist North and
capitalist South in 1945.

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Two top members of the Australian
cricket team were secretly fined for accepting money in 1994 from
Indian bookmaker, the Australian Cricket Board said Tuesday
evening.
	   The Australian Broadcasting Corp. said the Australian Cricket
Board named the players as Shane Warne and Mark Waugh.
	   The Australian Cricket Board said it would hold a news
conference on the matter Wednesday, at which the players involved
would be present.
	   The incident took place during the 1994 tour of Pakistan, when
they took money for providing information to an Indian bookmaker.
	   It was the first time the ACB had revealed two players were
fined 2,500 Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 1,550) each during the
1994 tour of the subcontinent.
	   The domestic news agency Australian Associated Press quoted
former Test player and now commentator David Hookes as saying Waugh
and Warne had provided the bookie with information about the
weather and ground conditions during the Test matches on the tour
of Pakistan in exchange for money.
	   The revelations are sure to be of interest throughout the
cricket world, particularly in Pakistan where an official inquiry
has been held into charges
	   of bribery against players.
	   Australia's 1994 tour of Pakistan has become notorious for
charges of match-fixing and bribery levelled against then Pakistani
captain Salim Malik.
	   Waugh, Warne and former player Tim May had accused Malik of
attempting to
	   bribe them. Malik has protested his innocence.
	   Justice Malik Mohammad Qayyum is due to submit his report on the
match-fixing scandal to Pakistan president Mohammad Rafiq Tarar in
the next fortnight.
	   Waugh, Warne and May were unavailable for comment Tuesday night.
	   The ACB refused to comment further.

Report: Development project threatens sacred temple
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Environmentalists say one of
Cambodia's most sacred and historic temples could be threatened by
a military development project, a local newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   A 2,400-hectare (5,900-acre) forest near Phnom Kulen temple in
northern Cambodia has been approved ``for agriculture, exploitation
and services to support the needs'' of the Cambodian army, The
Cambodia Daily reported, citing a copy of the contract.
	   The contract is an apparent violation of Cambodian law, as the
dense forests surrounding Phnom Kulen, just east of the famed
Angkor Wat temple, were declared a protected area by King Norodom
Sihanouk in 1993.
	   Chay Samith, acting director of conservation at the Environment
Ministry, confirmed the project will encroach on protected land. He
said the ministry would urge Hun Sen's Cabinet to reconsider the
deal, the paper reported.
	   ``It is a historic site for eco-tourism and cultural tourism,''
Chay Samith told the newspaper.
	   He said that if the trees are cleared the temples will be
exposed to strong winds and erosion.
	   The contract to develop Phnom Kulen was approved by the
government in June and bears the signatures of Prime Minister Hun
Sen and army Chief of Staff Gen. Ke Kim Yan, according to The
Cambodia Daily.
	   The development reportedly include construction of a hotel,
casino and hydroelectric power station, the paper said.
	   Phnom Kulen is considered the birthplace of the Angkor Empire
and the Cambodian monarchy. King Jayavarman II declared
independence in a ceremony at the temple in the year 802.
	   As the kingdom expanded to include much of present-day Thailand,
Jayavarman's successors built Angkor Wat and the surrounding
temples that have been described as some of the world's greatest
architectural wonders.
	   They are now Cambodia's most popular tourist attractions.
	   Until recently, Phnom Kulen was considered too dangerous for
tourists because of Khmer Rouge guerrillas in the northern jungles.
The guerrilla group weakened and collapsed over the past two years,
allowing the government to reopen Phnom Kulen to visitors.

Hundreds gather for human rights conference in Baghdad
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Hundreds of delegates from Europe and the
Middle East gathered Tuesday for what was billed as an
international symposium on human rights in a very unlikely place _
Baghdad.
	   But at this conference, the issue was not charges against Iraq's
government. The issue was the U.N. sanctions and the very visible
damage they have wrought in Iraq over the past eight years.
	   ``We hope the symposium will be able to shed more light on the
hideous crimes committed every day of the embargo that is imposed
upon our people and their human rights,'' Iraqi Foreign Minister
Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf said in opening the conference.
	   The sanctions, including an oil embargo, were imposed after Iraq
invaded Kuwait in 1990. The U.N. Security Council will only lift
them once U.N. inspectors certify that Iraq has dismantled its
weapons of mass destruction, long-range missiles and programs to
build them.
	   Iraq says 5,000 to 6,000 children die every month from hunger
and a shortage of medicines blamed on the sanctions. U.N. figures
suggest malnutrition is rampant, affecting as many as a third of
all Iraqi children.
	   Throughout the country, infrastructure is crumbling, sometimes
sending sewage into drinking water.
	   The severity of the Iraqis' plight was echoed by some in the
largely sympathetic audience, which applauded twice at the mention
of President Saddam Hussein. His picture sat next to the podium.
	   ``The first right is the right to eat,'' Gilles Muniar, general
secretary of the France-Iraq Friendship Society, said in an
interview. ``After that, it is time to admit sin.''
	   Not all the delegates avoided the irony of holding a human
rights conference in a country like Iraq, where a U.N. report this
year suggested that 1,500 people were executed in 1997.
	   George Galloway, a British parliament member and critic of the
sanctions, acknowledged that widespread abuses occurred in Iraq.
But, he said, the impact of the sanctions overshadowed them.
	   ``Compared to that, all other infringements of liberties are
almost by definition smaller,'' he said in an interview.
	   Al-Sahhaf himself skirted the question of abuses. But he argued
that human rights were used as ``a means of blackmail and political
pressure.''
	   ``Human rights have become a political weapon in the hands of
some states,'' the foreign minister said.

China denies helping weapons proliferation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China, responding to a news report that it sent
missile technology to Iran, denied Tuesday aiding weapons
proliferation and said it has honored its arms-control commitments.
	   But Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao did not confirm or
deny the report by the Washington Times newspaper that China sent
Iran equipment in November that could be used to test medium-range
missiles.
	   China agreed in 1994 not to sell surface-to-surface missiles,
but U.S. officials suspect they may be supplying technologies used
to develop missiles.
	   Chinese and U.S. officials met in November to discuss China's
joining the 32-nation Missile Technology Control Regime, which
President Jiang Zemin promised to consider in June.
	   ``China's position on the export of missiles has proceeded
always from being responsible for security in the region and has
honored its commitment by adopting effective and strict controls,
and there is no such issue of proliferation,'' Zhu said at a
briefing.
	   The Washington Times said China had supplied Iran with telemetry
equipment that could be used in testing missiles such as its new
Shahab-3, which was tested for the first time this year.

each drove in two runs.

Officials: Bodies of four kidnapped foreigners found
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; URGENT &QC; 
 &UR; By RUSLAN MUSAYEV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ Chechen officials said the bodies of four
kidnapped foreigners had been found Tuesday near a remote village.
	   But an Associated Press reporter saw four severed heads near the
village of Assinovskaya, about 40 kms (25 miles) west of Grozny,
the Chechen capital.
	   The heads were identified as those of the four foreigners by
Umar Makhauri, who had been a bodyguard assigned to the four when
they were abducted Oct. 3 by unidentified gunmen in Grozny. He said
the bodies had not been found.
	   One New Zealand and three British engineers were kidnapped.
	   Chechen government officials at the scene refused to comment.
	   Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov said the bodies of four men
had been recovered. There was no immediate explanation for the
discrepencies.
	   Kidnapping of foreigners for ransom is rampant in Chechnya, a
lawless region in southern Russia. But victims are rarely killed.

Philippines to allow duty-free import of fisheries, farm equipment
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine government will allow
duty-free imports of most farm and fishing equipment for five years
to boost agriculture and fishing in the country, officials said
Tuesday.
	   Government officials signed an order Monday authorizing the
duty-free imports, to begin this year.
	   Agriculture Secretary William Dar said the removal of tariffs
will allow small farmers to buy equipment they need to modernize
farms. Small fishermen will also be able to buy cheaper equipment
to increase their catch.
	   Among the items covered by the order are most types of farm
tractors and spare parts, irrigation equipment, packaging machines,
farm chemicals, scales, harvesting equipment and farm vans and
trailers, the agriculture department said.
	   Also included are plant seedlings, semen of selected of animals
for breeding, poultry feed and fishing nets, the department said.
	   The Philippines is principally an agricultural country, and many
farms are still tilled by water buffaloes and lack irrigation. A
prolonged drought last year and a recent series of strong typhoons
struck agricultural lands in the central and northern Philippines,
causing sharp drops in production.

Ukrainian president vetoes bill on minimum wage hike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma vetoed
Tuesday a bill that would have raised the country's minimum wage,
arguing the hike would force the government to make massive layoffs
and print more money, a news report said Monday.
	   The legislature voted last month to nearly triple the monthly
minimum wage from 55 hryvna (dlrs 16) to 148 hryvna (dlrs 43), and
also set the official poverty level at 118.6 hryvna (dlrs 35) a
month.
	   Kuchma said the government can't afford the new minimum wage,
and would have to fire 60 percent of state employees and sharply
raise taxes to balance its books, the Interfax news agency
reported.
	   Implementation of the law through a different option _ by
printing more money _ would increase quadruple inflation by the end
of 1998 and boost it by more than 100 times next year, Kuchma said.
	   Nearly all Ukrainians earn more than the minimum wage, and the
average monthly salary was about 170 hryvna (dlrs 50) in the first
half of 1998.
	   The minimum wage and poverty level figures, though, are used to
calculate various payments throughout the country.
	   Ukraine's leftist-dominated parliament has long favored extra
spending for social needs and has regularly made attempts to
increase the minimum wage despite government objections.

Sonia Gandhi in no hurry to topple right-wing government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India's main opposition leader Sonia
Gandhi accused Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's government of
mishandling India's economy, but appeared to be in no hurry to try
to topple the right-wing coalition.
	   The current political and economic situation continued to cause
extreme worry, local news agencies quoted Congress party leader
Gandhi as saying Tuesday in a speech to members of her party who
are in parliament.
	   Congress's strong showing in recent state elections _ which did
not directly affect the federal government _ led to speculation
Gandhi would call a vote of confidence to topple Vajpayee, and then
put together a new coalition to replace his government.
	   Signaling that the party would wait for the 19-party Vajpayee
government to fall on its own, Gandhi said: ``We stand prepared to
discharge our constitutional obligations as and when the situation
requires us to do so.''
	   Vajpayee's coalition suffered a setback Monday when a southern
alliance of four parties broke up and the main group decided to
support a general strike called next week by unions and other
parties to protest the government policies, including its decision
to allow 40 percent foreign equity in the insurance sector. The
four parties all continued to support Vajpayee, but his coalition
will be all the shakier with the southerners fighting among
themselves.

U.S. envoy urges Australia to accept nuclear waste dump
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Updates with government denying it will accept nuclear waste
from other nations. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ The United States is urging Australia
to accept a proposal by an American company to establish a dump for
the world's nuclear waste.
	   Seattle-based company Pangea has been quietly promoting the
concept for two years.
	   It was forced to go public with its plans last week when green
groups uncovered a promotional video extolling Australia's
qualities as a dump site.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton's special envoy on weapons of mass
destruction, Robert Gallucci, said Tuesday that the proposal would
not only be profitable for Australia but would also be a service to
the international community.
	   ``Australia could play a role in that, I think it would make a
tremendous
	   contribution to international security,'' he told Australian
Broadcasting Corp. radio.
	   Australia had a history of being active in promoting the
non-proliferation of nuclear weapons of mass destruction, he said.
	   ``I can't help but think that the economics would be very
favorable for a
	   commercial arrangement that involved addressing the needs of so
many countries who do not have the geology for the long term
storage of spent nuclear fuel or radioactive waste,'' he said.
	   A spokeswoman for Industry and Resources Minister Nick Minchin
said Australia had no plans to become an international nuclear
waste dump.
	   ``Government policy is not to accept waste from other countries
and there is no intention to change that,'' she said, speaking on
the customary condition of anonymity.

16 injured by bomb blast on bus in southern Philippines
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) _ At least 16 people were injured
when a homemade bomb suspected to have been planted by Muslim
extremists exploded inside a bus in the southern Philippines,
police said Tuesday.
	   Police said the 11-kilogram (24-pound) bomb, made from
gunpowder, was near the driver's seat when it exploded Monday on
the outskirts of Aurora in Zamboanga del Sur province.
	   Investigators said they suspect the extremist Abu Sayyaf group
bombed the bus in retaliation for the bus company's failure to pay
``revolutionary taxes.''
	   Police and the military stepped up security at several bus
terminals in Zamboanga del Sur following the attack.
	   The Abu Sayyaf is believed to have been responsible for the
kidnapping of Italian priest Luciano Benedetti, who was abducted in
September and freed last month. They also are believed to be still
holding an 80-year-old Taiwanese woman and her maid, kidnapped a
day after Benedetti's abduction.
	   Talks for the release of the two are continuing.

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Twenty-four victims of an orphanage
fire, including 19 unidentified children, were buried Tuesday in
rows of concrete tombs at Manila's public cemetery.
	   Hundreds of people watched, some weeping, as the small coffins
were carried to the burial site. A Christmas package with a toy
inside was placed on top of each child's coffin before the simple
tombs were sealed.
	   Only eight of the 30 people who died in the predawn fire last
Thursday in the orphanage in a Manila slum neighborhood have been
identified because of their severe burns.
	   The private orphanage also housed children of unwed mothers and
of working parents.
	   Some relatives resisted Tuesday's burial, hoping that the badly
charred bodies could be identified first.
	   ``They have to be laid to rest,'' said Marisa Balasabas, the
mother of a 1-year-old boy who remains unidentified. ``With a heavy
heart, I have to accept what happened.''
	   Balasabas said the children's names will be listed on a common
marker next to the rows of concrete tombs.
	   ``Seeing the proper name on each tomb would have made it easier
for us to pray,'' she added with regret.
	   The bodies of other victims have been taken to their home
provinces by relatives.
	   Hours before the burial, hundreds of people, including survivors
of a disco fire in 1995 that killed 162 people, lit candles in
front of the ruins of the orphanage and called for tighter fire
inspections and punishment of those responsible. Many carried
placards reading, ``Give justice to the dead.''
	   The orphanage's staff said 30 people died in the blaze _ 25
children and five adults _ although fire investigators have found
only 28 bodies in the ruble of the 85-year-old building.
	   Investigators said it may take up to 15 days before they can
conclude what caused the fire in Manila's Paco district.
	   On Friday, fire officer Romeo Almero was removed as Paco fire
station chief. No reason was given for his suspension, but local
news reports said firefighters arrived late at the scene.
	   Fire officials said the fire was not immediately reported,
apparently because of the absence of telephones in the slum
neighborhood. The first call came from someone several blocks away,
they said.
	   The tragedy revived concerns about the government's
fire-fighting ability.
	   In Manila, only 15 of about 40 city fire trucks are in operating
condition. About 100 more are run by volunteer fire brigades funded
by ethnic Chinese-Filipino business groups.

China, Qatar win in soccer

 &UR; Eds: Will be led with later games &QL;

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A humiliating own goal by Tajikistan
captain Takhirdjon Muminov helped China to a 3-1 victory Tuesday in
an often sloppy Group 3 second-round match of the Asian Games
soccer tournament.
	   Zhao Junzhe scored the first goal for China, which fielded a
number of untried players against one of the weaker sides in the
group.
	   In Group 4 action, Qatar beat Lebanon 1-0.
	   China's English coach, Bobby Houghton, is concerned about his
game Saturday against Iran after playing Oman on Thursday.
	   The top two teams of each of the four groups advance to the
quarterfinals.
	   ``I think it is a fairly even group but I think Iran is probably
the favorite of the tournament because they brought a World Cup
side here. We have an Olympic side,'' Houghton said. ``We will
probably have a real challenge with Iran.''
	   China dominated Tajikstan from the start. Combining with short
passes and with a sharp offense led by Yao Xia, they exploited the
weak right side.
	   In the 10th minute, Yao broke loose from midfield and passed to
Zhao, who took a clear shot from eight meters for the only first
half goal.
	   Spearheaded by a darting Ma Mingyu, China's defenders handily
controlled the midfield and contained Tajikistan's attack.
	   The Chinese failed several attempts for the second goal in the
remainder of the first half.
	   Facing a nearly empty goal area in the 30th minute, Hao Haidong
and Wang Peng, looking for his third goal, failed to finish for the
score.
	   Tajikistan clawed back in the second half. In the 53rd minute,
Suthbo Thamiedv drilled a 15-meter shot at a tight angle that
keeper Jang Jin couldn't control. Rustam Zabirov finished from
point-blank range to equalize.
	   But China quickly went back ahead when a long, lofty cross by Ma
found the head of Li Junyu, who bounded the ball slowly into the
net to make it 2-1.
	   Each side turned up the pressure. Chinese substitute Huang Young
fired a 15-meter shot at the near corner that glanced off Muminov's
chin into the net for an own goal and a final 3-1 score.
	   ``We were in control of the game and we let the other side back
in there,'' Houghton said. ``I think we need to be a bit more
controlled in front.''
	   In the other afternoon game, Qatar defeated Lebanon 1-0 with a
straight shot from the top of the penalty box by Abdul Karim Dad
just 10 minutes into the game.
	   After that, the play went back and forth without too much
opportunity to increase the scoring. Lebanon managed just four
shots on goal.
	   Qatar meets Kazakstan on Thursday and eventually host Thailand.
	   The match with Thailand is expected to attract extra excitement
among Thai fans as players from those two countries had engaged in
an all-out brawl in a so-called friendly match just days before the
start of the games.

In advance of Clinton visit, Palestinians deploy APCs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Armored personnel carriers were
deployed Tuesday around the convention center where U.S. President
Bill Clinton will address 1,500 Palestinian delegates next week.
	   U.S. Secret Service agents have already arrived in Gaza to work
with their Palestinian counterparts on how to protect Clinton
during his first visit to Palestinian areas.
	   ``There is cooperation with the American security people. We
have our own plan. The Americans have their own procedures as
well,'' said the Palestinian police chief, Ghazi Jabali.
	   The Islamic militant group Hamas, which hopes to scuttle the
accord, has been careful not to openly threaten Clinton. However,
Hamas has carried out more than a dozen suicide bombings in Israel
in an attempt to bring peace talks with Israel to a halt.
	   On Monday, Clinton and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat are to
address members of the Palestine National Council and delegates
from other groups, at the Shawa Cultural Center in Gaza City.
	   Traffic near the Shawa Center still flowed normally Tuesday, but
plainclothes security as well as uniformed officers with M-17 and
AK-47 assault rifles began patrolling in the vicinity. Streets
around the center are to be closed days before the Clinton visit.
	   Four armored personnel were parked at the corners of the
convention center, with members of Arafat's elite bodyguard unit,
known as Force 17, sitting on the vehicles.
	   APCs were also deployed outside Arafat's guest house and near
the Palestinian legislative council.
	   Jabali said the APCs were part of a Palestinian security plan
that has been presented to the Americans. U.S. security agents, in
turn, have given their Palestinian counterparts sophisticated
explosives detection equipment.
	   ``The Palestinian police are ready to protect President Clinton
here in Gaza or in Bethlehem,'' Jabali said, referring to Clinton's
expected visit next Tuesday to the Church of the Nativity in the
biblical West Bank town of Bethlehem
	   In Jerusalem, Clinton's entourage of 1,200 people will take over
the Jerusalem Hilton, at a cost of half a million dollars. The
hotel boasts stunning views of Jerusalem's walled Old City and the
slopes of the Judean Desert.

	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ Chechen authorities found the remains of
four kidnapped foreigners Tuesday near a remote village in the
breakaway region in southern Russia.
	   An Associated Press reporter saw four severed heads near the
village of Assinovskaya, about 40 kms (25 miles) west of Grozny,
the Chechen capital. There was no sign of any bodies.
	   The heads were identified as those of the four foreigners by
Umar Makhauri, who had been a bodyguard assigned to the four when
they were abducted Oct. 3 by unidentified gunmen in Grozny. He said
the bodies had not been found.
	   Chechen government officials at the scene refused to comment.
	   Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov said the bodies of four men
had been recovered, but gave no further details.
	   The hostages _ Britons Peter Kennedy, Darren Hickey, and Rudolf
Petschi, and New Zealand's Stanley Shaw _ were kidnapped on Oct. 3.
They were working for Granger Telecom, a British telephone company,
installing 300,000 telephone lines across Chechnya.
	   Chechen authorities had been searching for the missing men for
the past two months. British officials said they had not received
any ransom demand for the missing men.
	   Hostage-takings, usually for ransom, have become common in
Chechnya since the end of the breakaway republic's two-year war for
independence from Russia in 1996. But victims are rarely killed.
	   Since the beginning of 1998, 176 people have been kidnapped in
the North Caucasus region of Russia, including dozens of
foreigners, and 90 of them released, officials have said.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's parliament on Tuesday again postponed
discussions on the START II treaty after failing to meet a deadline
for sending a related measure on nuclear weapons to President Boris
Yeltsin, a news report said.
	   The parliament's agenda setting body, the Duma Council, had
planned to review a bill outlining Russia's nuclear weapons program
on Tuesday.
	   But it delayed debate because no parliamentary factions except
the liberal Yabloko party submitted proposals or suggestions for
the measure, the Interfax news agency said.
	   Russia's Communist-led parliament has repeatedly delayed action
on the START II treaty, signed by the United States and Russia in
1993.
	   The lawmakers want an additional measure outlining the country's
nuclear weapons program before they act on the treaty.
	   One positive note was sounded Tuesday when Nikolai Kharitonov, a
leader of the Communist-allied Agrarian Party, said he had changed
his mind about the treaty after a meeting with Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov, and now supported it.
	   ``As things stand now, ratification is in Russia's interest,''
Kharitonov said, according to the Interfax news agency. He
suggested that Russia could enhance its prospects for Western
financial aid by ratifying the accord.
	   The START II treaty would halve the Russian and American nuclear
arsenals to about 3,000 to 3,500 warheads each.
	   Yabloko leaders accused Communists in the parliament of once
again stalling on the treaty, which the United States Senate
ratified in 1996.
	   Yeltsin and other proponents of ratification say the missiles
that would be destroyed under START-II will soon be out of date
anyway.

In advance of Clinton visit, Palestinians deploy APCs

	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Armored personnel carriers were
deployed Tuesday around the convention center where U.S. President
Bill Clinton will address 1,500 Palestinian delegates next week.
	   U.S. Secret Service agents have already arrived in Gaza to work
with their Palestinian counterparts on how to protect Clinton
during his first visit to Palestinian areas.
	   ``There is cooperation with the American security people. We
have our own plan. The Americans have their own procedures as
well,'' said the Palestinian police chief, Ghazi Jabali.
	   The Islamic militant group Hamas, which hopes to scuttle the
accord, has been careful not to openly threaten Clinton. However,
Hamas has carried out more than a dozen suicide bombings in Israel
in an attempt to bring peace talks with Israel to a halt.
	   On Monday, Clinton and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat are to
address members of the Palestine National Council and delegates
from other groups, at the Shawa Cultural Center in Gaza City.
	   Traffic near the Shawa Center still flowed normally Tuesday, but
plainclothes security as well as uniformed officers with assault
rifles began patrolling in the vicinity. Streets around the center
are to be closed days before the Clinton visit.
	   Four armored personnel were parked at the corners of the
convention center, with members of Arafat's elite bodyguard unit,
known as Force 17, sitting on the vehicles.
	   APCs were also deployed outside Arafat's guest house and near
the Palestinian legislative council.
	   Jabali said the APCs were part of a Palestinian security plan
that has been presented to the Americans. U.S. security agents, in
turn, have given their Palestinian counterparts sophisticated
explosives detection equipment.
	   ``The Palestinian police are ready to protect President Clinton
here in Gaza or in Bethlehem,'' Jabali said, referring to Clinton's
expected visit next Tuesday to the Church of the Nativity in the
biblical West Bank town of Bethlehem
	   In Jerusalem, Clinton's entourage of 1,200 people will take over
the Jerusalem Hilton, at a cost of half a million dollars. The
hotel boasts stunning views of Jerusalem's walled Old City and the
slopes of the Judean Desert.

	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ Chechen officials said the bodies of four
kidnapped foreigners had been found today near a remote village.
	   An Associated Press reporter saw four severed heads but no other
remains near the village of Assinovskaya, about 25 miles west of
Grozny, the capital of Chechnya.
	   The heads were identified as those of the four missing
foreigners by Umar Makhauri, who had been a bodyguard assigned to

	   Britons Peter Kennedy, Darren Hickey and Rudolf Petschi and New
Zealander Stanley Shaw were kidnapped on Oct. 3. They were working
for Granger Telecom, a British telephone company, installing
300,000 telephone lines across Chechnya.
	   Chechen authorities had been searching for the missing men for
the past two months. British officials said they had not received
any ransom demand for the missing men.
	   Chechen government officials at the scene today refused to
comment.
	   Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov said the bodies of four men
had been recovered. There was no immediate explanation for the
discrepancy between the official account that bodies had been
recovered and the reporter's account that only heads had been
found.
	   Hostage-takings, usually for ransom, have become common in
Chechnya since the end of the breakaway republic's two-year war for

	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ Chechen authorities found the remains of
four kidnapped foreigners Tuesday near a remote village in the
breakaway region in southern Russia.
	   An Associated Press reporter saw four severed heads near the
village of Assinovskaya, about 40 kms (25 miles) west of Grozny,

working for Granger Telecom, a British telephone company,
installing 300,000 telephone lines across Chechnya.
	   The British Foreign Ministry said it was investigating urgently
reports that bodies had been found.
	   A spokesman for Granger Telecom in Britain said, ``We have heard
the reports and are obviously investigating, but there is nothing
we can say at this stage.''
	   Eamon Hickey, the father of one of the missing men, said he
heard the news and was hoping it would not be confirmed.
	   ``There is so much rumor and counter-rumor coming from out there
that we don't know what to think. Obviously we are hoping and
praying that it does not turn out to be true,'' he said at his home
in England.

Gulf countries agree to cut oil production
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: COMBINES urgent series, ADDS background. &QL; 
 &UR; By ANWAR FARUQI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ Gulf Arab oil ministers
agreed Tuesday to cut oil production to shore up weak world prices
that have hit their economies hard, officials close to the talks
said.
	   They said that oil ministers of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation
Council agreed to reduce production starting in March and to ask
other producers in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries to join them in the cuts.
	   The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
ministers also agreed to ask Mexico, which is not an OPEC member,
to join in cutting back production.
	   The officials did not know the exact cuts agreed by the
ministers, apparently at the urging of Saudi Arabia.
	   The oil ministers are among the delegations accompanying the six
GCC leaders at a three-day summit in Abu Dhabi that opened Monday.
	   The ministers' decision likely will be reviewed by the GCC
leaders, and it is expected to get their endorsement.
	   The GCC groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and
the Emirates. All except Oman and Bahrain are members of OPEC.
	   The decision by the GCC oil ministers comes less than two weeks
after OPEC ministers adjourned a testy, year-end meeting in the
Austrian capital Vienna without agreeing on measures to halt the
slide in oil prices.
	   Instead of agreeing to further production cuts or to extend
previously agreed cutbacks, the 11-nation cartel decided to review
the situation in March.
	   The inaction sent markets into gyrations.
	   Shortly before the GCC meeting began, January futures contracts
for Brent crude _ a widely watched benchmark _ fell to a record low
of dlrs 9.92 a barrel on the International Petroleum Exchange in
London. The contracts closed at dlrs 10.26.
	   Gulf oil generally sells at a dollar or two less than the North
Sea's Brent _ which itself was selling for around dlrs 20 a barrel
as recently as 1997.
	   The Gulf countries, which together sit on half the world's
proven oil reserves and depend on exports for 75 percent of their
revenues, have been hard hit by plummeting oil prices.
	   The officials said that pressure for a decision on production
cutbacks came from Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter.
	   ``The main source of our income has been greatly shaken by the
imbalance of the oil market,'' Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Abdullah
said Monday.
	   ``Such an imbalance requires us to exert our utmost efforts
inside and outside OPEC,'' said Abdullah, who is leading the Saudi
delegation to the GCC in place of his ailing half-brother, King
Fahd.
	   He called for new and serious measures to restore market balance
and ``not hesitate to take further measures for the common
interest.''

	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ Chechen authorities found the remains of
four kidnapped foreigners Tuesday near a remote village in the
breakaway region in southern Russia.
	   An Associated Press reporter saw four severed heads near the
village of Assinovskaya, about 40 kms (25 miles) west of Grozny,
the Chechen capital. He did not see any sign of the bodies.
	   The heads were identified as those of the four abducted
foreigners by Umar Makhauri, who had been a bodyguard assigned to
the four when they were abducted Oct. 3 by unidentified gunmen in
Grozny. He said the bodies had not been found.
	   Chechen government officials at the scene refused to comment.
	   Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov said in Grozny that the bodies
of four men had been recovered, but gave no further details.
	   The hostages _ Britons Peter Kennedy, Darren Hickey, and Rudolf
Petschi, and New Zealand's Stanley Shaw _ were engineers. They were
working for Granger Telecom, a British telephone company,
installing 300,000 telephone lines across Chechnya.
	   The British Foreign Ministry said it was investigating urgently
reports that bodies had been found.
	   A spokesman for Granger Telecom in Britain said, ``We have heard
the reports and are obviously investigating, but there is nothing
we can say at this stage.''
	   Eamon Hickey, the father of one of the missing men, said he
heard the news and was hoping it would not be confirmed.
	   ``There is so much rumor and counter-rumor coming from out there
that we don't know what to think. Obviously we are hoping and
praying that it does not turn out to be true,'' he said at his home
in England.
	   Chechen authorities had been searching for the missing men for
the past two months. British officials said they had not received
any ransom demand for the missing men.
	   Hostage-takings, usually for ransom, have become common in
Chechnya since the end of the breakaway republic's two-year war for
independence from Russia in 1996. But victims are rarely killed.
	   Since the beginning of 1998, 176 people have been kidnapped in
the North Caucasus region of Russia, including dozens of
foreigners, and 90 of them released, officials have said.

Russian companies buy 107 million barrels of Iraqi oil
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian oil companies bought 107 million barrels
of Iraqi oil over the last six months as part of Iraq's
oil-for-food program, a news report said Tuesday.
	   Purchases by the thirteen Russian oil companies, including
powerhouses Sidanko and Lukoil, totaled dlrs 1.25 billion, or about
35 percent of all oil bought from Iraq under the six month export
quota, the Interfax news agency said.
	   Iraq was entitled to export dlrs 5.25 billion in oil from June 6
to Nov. 25 of this year to buy food and medicine.
	   Russian oil companies, which export a great deal of oil of their
own, are eager to maintain ties with Iraq because they have
billions of dollars in oil contracts that were frozen when the
United Nations imposed sanctions and an oil embargo on the Arab
country.
	   Iraq wants the embargo lifted so it can resume exporting oil at
full capacity and rebuild its shattered economy. Russia supports
lifting the embargo, as well as the remaining UN sanctions, as soon
as possible.
	   During a visit by Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz to
Moscow Tuesday, Russia called for a ``comprehensive review'' of
Iraq's compliance with United Nations resolutions, saying this
should help wrap up seven years of U.N. weapons inspections.
	   Iraq agreed to resume cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors
last month after a confrontation that nearly led to military
strikes by the United States.
	   U.N. weapons experts must certify that Iraq has destroyed its
biological, chemical and nuclear weapons before the U.N. Security
Council will lift sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in
1990.

Ruling party ahead in Central African Republic polls
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGUI, Central African Republic (AP) _ The ruling Movement for
the Liberation of the People of Centrafrique has captured a
majority of assembly seats in the first round of legislative polls,
the country's top court said Tuesday.
	   The MLPC won 27 of the 45 seats up for grabs in the first round
of voting, while a coalition of opposition parties won 15. The
remaining three seats went to independent candidates.
	   The Constitutional Court in Bangui released the results of the
voting more than two weeks after the first round polls were held.
	   A second round of legislative voting is scheduled for next week.
	   In all, about 840 candidates are vying for 109 parliamentary
seats _ the vast majority of which are now controlled by President
Ange-Felix Patasse's ruling MLPC.
	   At least 23 opposition parties are participating in the
elections.
	   The election is seen as an important effort to stabilize the
Central African Republic, which has been wracked by ethnic and
factional violence since independence more than three decades ago.
	   Through the 1960s and 1970s, the Central African Republic fell
under the tyrannical rule of former army Col. Jean-Bedel Bokassa,
who was accused of corruption, murder, torture and cannibalism
before being ousted in a bloodless coup in 1979.
	   In his wake, the Central African Republic remains a troubled and
isolated country that at times appears to be teetering on anarchy.
	   Since May 1996, mutinous soldiers have staged three major
rebellions against Patasse, whose election in 1993 ended more than
a decade of army rule.

	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A railway station worker was killed and two
others badly injured in central Ukraine after a train accidentally
ran over them, officials said Tuesday.
	   The workers were cleaning snow from rail switching points and
apparently hit a switch that diverted an approaching locomotive on
to the line they were working on, the Emergency Situations Ministry
said.
	   The accident occurred at the Znamianka Tovarna station in
Kirovohrad region, the ministry said.

Ukrainian president vetoes bill on minimum wage hike
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS ``Monday'' to ``Tuesday'' in lead.

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma vetoed
Tuesday a bill that would have raised the country's minimum wage,
arguing the hike would force the government to make massive layoffs
and print more money, a news report said Tuesday.
	   The legislature voted last month to nearly triple the monthly
minimum wage from 55 hryvna (dlrs 16) to 148 hryvna (dlrs 43), and
also set the official poverty level at 118.6 hryvna (dlrs 35) a
month.
	   Kuchma said the government can't afford the new minimum wage,
and would have to fire 60 percent of state employees and sharply
raise taxes to balance its books, the Interfax news agency
reported.
	   Implementation of the law through a different option _ by
printing more money _ would increase quadruple inflation by the end
of 1998 and boost it by more than 100 times next year, Kuchma said.
	   Nearly all Ukrainians earn more than the minimum wage, and the
average monthly salary was about 170 hryvna (dlrs 50) in the first
half of 1998.
	   The minimum wage and poverty level figures, though, are used to
calculate various payments throughout the country.
	   Ukraine's leftist-dominated parliament has long favored extra
spending for social needs and has regularly made attempts to
increase the minimum wage despite government objections.

Gulf countries agree to cut oil production
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: COMBINES urgent series, ADDS background. &QL; 
 &UR; By ANWAR FARUQI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ Gulf Arab oil ministers
agreed Tuesday to cut oil production to shore up weak world prices
that have hit their economies hard, officials close to the talks
said.
	   They said that oil ministers of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation
Council agreed to reduce production starting in March and to ask
other producers in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries to join them in the cuts.
	   The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
ministers also agreed to ask Mexico, which is not an OPEC member,
to join in cutting back production.
	   The officials did not know the exact cuts agreed by the
ministers, apparently at the urging of Saudi Arabia.
	   The oil ministers are among the delegations accompanying the six
GCC leaders at a three-day summit in Abu Dhabi that opened Monday.
	   The ministers' decision likely will be reviewed by the GCC
leaders, and it is expected to get their endorsement.
	   The GCC groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and
the Emirates. All except Oman and Bahrain are members of OPEC.
	   The decision by the GCC oil ministers comes less than two weeks
after OPEC ministers adjourned a testy, year-end meeting in the
Austrian capital Vienna without agreeing on measures to halt the
slide in oil prices.
	   Instead of agreeing to further production cuts or to extend
previously agreed cutbacks, the 11-nation cartel decided to review
the situation in March.
	   The inaction sent markets into gyrations.
	   Shortly before the GCC meeting began, January futures contracts
for Brent crude _ a widely watched benchmark _ fell to a record low
of dlrs 9.92 a barrel on the International Petroleum Exchange in
London. The contracts closed at dlrs 10.26.
	   Gulf oil generally sells at a dollar or two less than the North
Sea's Brent _ which itself was selling for around dlrs 20 a barrel
as recently as 1997.
	   The Gulf countries, which together sit on half the world's
proven oil reserves and depend on exports for 75 percent of their
revenues, have been hard hit by plummeting oil prices.
	   The officials said that pressure for a decision on production
cutbacks came from Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter.
	   ``The main source of our income has been greatly shaken by the
imbalance of the oil market,'' Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Abdullah
said Monday.
	   ``Such an imbalance requires us to exert our utmost efforts
inside and outside OPEC,'' said Abdullah, who is leading the Saudi
delegation to the GCC in place of his ailing half-brother, King
Fahd.
	   He called for new and serious measures to restore market balance
and ``not hesitate to take further measures for the common
interest.''

Small turnout for anti-communist demo called by opposition leader
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) - A planned antigovernment demonstration
drew less people then expected on Tuesday, easing police fears that
it would generate another round of violence in politically unstable
Albania.
	   Hundreds of anti-communist protesters marched from the
university to the downtown headquarters of the Democratic Party, as
they heeded a call by former President Sali Berisha to commemorate
a pro-democracy student protest eight years ago.
	   An Interior Ministry statement said the demonstration was not
authorized. It also said that the Ministry had received reports
that acts of violence could be committed during the demonstration.
	   With political unrest frequent over the past year in Albania,
police and army units were out in force Tuesday, guarding
government buildings and state radio. A high-voltage tower was
blown up on Sunday night leaving students' dormitories without
power and increasing fears of violence.
	   The most recent instability was generated by the killing in
September of Azem Hajdari, a Berisha associate and the leader of
the students' movement in 1990, during the start of the
pro-democracy movement that followed decades of communist rule.
Berisha backers said the government was behind the killing and
Tirana was rocked by days of subsequent unrest.
	   A monument to Hajdari was to be inaugurated at Democratic Party
headquarters Tuesday.

	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Six Ukrainians have died from gas poisoning
during the past two days, officials said Tuesday.
	   Three residents in the southeastern city of Dnipropetrovsk died
in their house Monday after poisonous carbon monoxide from burning
fuel accumulated because of bad ventilation, the Emergency
Situations Ministry said.
	   Three other people from the central Ukrainian village of
Martusivka, including two babies, were poisoned Sunday by fumes
that leaked from a heating system installed in their house.

Father of terrorist victim pushes for Palestinian prisoner release
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ The father of an Israeli soldier
killed by Islamic militants joined Palestinian mothers at a protest
tent to demand the release of their sons jailed for terrorism.
	   Islamic militants kidnapped and killed Arik Frankenthal four
years ago, when the 19-year-old was on his way home from his army
base.
	   Yitzhak Frankenthal joined the mothers camped in their protest
tent in the West Bank town of Ramallah on Tuesday and told them
that he hopes their children come home soon.
	   ``If I can stop terrorism in the future by releasing someone who
committed a terrorist attack, then I profit by his release, too,''
Frankenthal said.
	   Prisoner release demonstrations have grown violent throughout
the West Bank and the Gaza Strip as the Palestinians step up
demands that Israel release prisoners being held for anti_Israel
activity.
	   Frankenthal, an Orthodox Jew, said releasing those jailed as
part of the Palestinian-Israeli political struggle will bring about
the reconciliation necessary for lasting peace.
	   ``Those who are soldiers to us, are murderers to them. Those who
are murderers to them, are soldiers to us,'' Frankenthal said.
	   Frankenthal, 47, said that he was once a businessman, but after
his son's death began to work with nonprofit peace groups. Later
Tuesday, he met with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to discuss
the peace process.

Dollar rises against yen in Tokyo, Japanese stocks close higher
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with late dollar, bond and other details

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Confidence in the strength of the U.S. economy
pushed the dollar up against the yen Tuesday, while Japanese stock
prices closed moderately higher.
	   The dollar bought 119.86 yen in late afternoon trading, up 0.90
yen from late Monday in Tokyo and also above its late New York
level of 119.81 yen overnight.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 84.71
points, or 0.58 percent, to close the day at 14,808.20. On Monday,
the average finished up 83.52 points, or 0.57 percent.
	   Following an overnight rise on Wall Street, the dollar surged
past the 120 yen barrier early Tuesday and stayed above that level
for most of the day. The Dow Jones industrial average closed at
9,070.47 points on Monday, up 54.33.
	   On Friday, the U.S. Labor Department said the nation's
unemployment rate stood at a 28-year low. That data was helpful in
diffusing increasing speculation the Federal Reserve would move to
again ease interest rates in the near future.
	   Expectations of lower interest rates put downward pressure on
the U.S. currency as reduced rates mean lower yields on
dollar-denominated deposits.
	   Sentiment prompting dollar-buying was also bolstered after U.S.
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin denied a Japanese media report that
he planned to resign.
	   ``There was some sort of report out ... but it was totally,
absolutely, 100 percent erroneous,'' Rubin said Monday before
delivering a speech in New York.
	   The dollar briefly sank Monday after Japan's Sankei newspaper
quoted an unidentified U.S. government official as saying that
Rubin had told President Clinton that he wanted to step down.
	   The U.S. currency also strengthened as investors covered short,
or oversold, positions.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, share prices rose as the overnight
gains on Wall Street sent shares of Japanese international blue
chips higher.
	   Some domestic-oriented companies also gained after Bank of Japan
Gov. Masaru Hayami said that the current stability in Japanese
stocks and a recent rise in long-term interest rates could help
bring optimism back to Japan's financial markets.
	   Government stimulus measures, including the recent passage of a
law to allow infusion of public funds into banks, also bolstered
stock price.
	   But traders remained cautious as they awaited more news on
coalition plans between the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and
minority Liberal Party, analysts said.
	   Market players hope the coalition will result in new economic
stimulus measures, such as more aggressive tax cuts, which the
Liberal Party favors.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
exchange's first section climbed 6.99 points, or 0.62 percent, to
close at 1131.99. The TOPIX closed up 4.28 points, or 0.38 percent,
the day before.
	   An estimated 356.08 million shares changed hands on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, up from 239.68 million on
Monday. Declines outnumbered advances 611 to 497, while 168 issues
were unchanged.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond slipped to 1.050 percent from Monday's finish of 1.060
percent, pushing its price up to 106.47 yen from 106.38 yen.

First Singaporean AIDS victim to go public ahead of conference
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JASMINA KUZMANOVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Paddy Chew is a brave man.
	   On Saturday, when he addresses a local conference on AIDS, Chew
will be the first Singaporean to come out as both an AIDS sufferer
and a homosexual.
	   Sodomy is still illegal in this conservative city-state of 3.1
million, and the disease carries such a deep social stigma that
many sufferers keep their status secret even from their families.
	   But Chew, a 38-year-old former stage manager, said he's seeking
to give the deadly disease a human face.
	   ``I will come out all the way, even with my sexual preference,''
Chew said in an interview Tuesday. ``Singapore has come a long way
in many things, and it's time now to change its attitude towards
gays and AIDS.''
	   Chew, who has full-blown AIDS, said he was infected by unsafe
sex.
	   Local health officials, doctors and representatives of
pharmaceutical companies are expected to tackle the AIDS problem in
Singapore during a one-day conference, organized by the volunteer
group Action for Aids.
	   Officially, only 854 Singaporeans are carriers of HIV, the virus
that can lead to AIDS. But the World Health Organization recently
said the number of infected may be four times as high.
	   One of the 10 richest nations in the world, Singapore allows
only limited medical coverage for AIDS sufferers. Homosexuals are
virtually invisible, and there is no registered gay organization.
	   Though more than 90 percent of AIDS victims are male, the
government maintains that most of them had contracted the disease
through heterosexual sex. Rather than focusing on safe sex
practices, the official campaign urges Singaporeans to ``remain
faithful to one's spouse.''
	   ``This is a very closed, conservative society,'' said Chew,
adding that the official estimate of the infected is ``deceptively
low.''
	   ``Many Singaporeans get tested abroad, and never tell anybody
about their (positive HIV) status. They fear not only for
themselves, but for their families and loved ones as well.''
	   Chew said his family and most of his friends support his
decision to speak publicly about the disease.
	   ``My family has been wonderful,'' he said, adding that he gets a
``mixed response'' from friends. ``Some are supportive, some tell
me to shut up or emigrate.''
	   ``But if we all just keep quiet, there will be no public
support, no funding, just fear and discrimination,'' he said.
	   Asked whether he fears arrest, frail, lanky Chew roared with a
hearty laughter.
	   ``Let them arrest me. It will only further our cause.''

Asian Games await 33-year-old Indian mother running her last races

 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The Asian Games on Tuesday awaited
sprinter P.T. Usha, the 33-year-old mother from India who will run
her last races in an international meet.
	   ``I am really looking forward to talking to her, getting a few
tips,'' said Susantika Jayasinghe of Sri Lanka, 10 years younger.
	   Fellow athletes view Usha not merely as a competitor, but
someone who can inspire others.
	   ``She is not only a great runner, but very brave,'' said
Jayasinghe, a runner who herself is fighting odds to return to
track honors after a drug abuse scandal that has nearly ruined her
career.
	   Twenty years ago, Usha, then a shy, 13-year-old in pigtails,
arrived on the Indian athletic scene. Today, the railroad public
relations official is the only Indian to boost of an Asian Games
gold in track and field since 1986.
	   For these games, she has missed a crucial part of her training
due to a heel injury. In addition, in a November meet in the
eastern city of Calcutta, she strained her right hamstring,
collapsing in the 200 meters.
	   In Bangkok, Usha may run only in her favorite 400 meters, since
endurance is not among her problems.
	   In the 200, even at her best, Usha would find it difficult to
beat the Chinese.
	   ``My preparations have been geared toward 400 meters,'' Usha,
mother of a 6-year-old son Ujwal, meaning radiant in the Hindi
language, said in a recent interview.
	   Usha has been India's most unpredictable athlete.
	   Taking everyone by surprise, she came out of her self-imposed
eight years of retirement to run in the Asian Track Championships
in Fukuoka, Japan, in July.
	   She was third, in 23.46 seconds, in the 200m. The same day, she
anchored India's victorious 4 x 100-meter relay. Usha also anchored
India's silver medal team in the 4 x 400, which finished .16
seconds behind China.
	   Usha has been unusual in India, where the question has been
raised whether the country of 980 million people is a ``sleeping
giant'' of sports, or whether there is something basically wrong
that prevents development of very few athletes of international
standard.
	   No Indian has won a track and field medal in the Olympics, but
Usha came closest, missing bronze by 0.01 seconds in the 400-meter
hurdles at the 1984 games.
	   Through Usha made her mark in 1978 in an under-14 Indian
National Athletic Championship, her prominence spread in 1982, when
she won silver at 100 and 200 meters in the New Delhi Asian Games.
One year later, she won gold in the 400 in the Asian championships
in Kuwait and a silver in the 200.
	   One year after starting her first retirement from sports in
1991, she married Sreenivasan, a sportsman in his own right. He
plays the Indian sport of kabaddi.

 &UR; Officials: Bodies of four kidnapped foreigners found 
	    &UR; From AP-Reuters &LR;  &QC; 
	   GROZNY, Russia (CP) _ The bodies of three Britons and a New
Zealander kidnapped in October were found today near a remote
village, Chechen officials said.
	   An Associated Press reporter saw four severed heads but no other
remains near the village of Assinovskaya, about 40 km west of
Grozny, the capital of Chechnya.
	   The heads were identified as those of the four missing
foreigners by Umar Makhauri, who had been a bodyguard assigned to
the four when unidentified gunmen abducted them in Grozny.
	   Britons Peter Kennedy, Darren Hickey and Rudolf Petschi and New
Zealander Stanley Shaw were kidnapped Oct. 3. They were working for
Granger Telecom, a British telephone company, installing 300,000
telephone lines across Chechnya.
	   Chechen authorities had been searching for the missing men.
British officials said they had not received any ransom demand for
the missing men.
	   Chechen government officials at the scene today refused to
comment.
	   Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov said the bodies of four men
had been recovered. There was no immediate explanation for the
discrepancy between the official statement that bodies had been
recovered and the reporter's account that only heads had been
found.
	   Hostage-takings, usually for ransom, have become common in
Chechnya since the end of the breakaway republic's war for
independence from Russia in 1996. But victims are rarely killed.
	   Since the beginning of 1998, 176 people have been kidnapped in
the North Caucasus region of Russia, including dozens of
foreigners, and 90 of them have been released, officials said.
	   Chechnya has suffered from poverty and lawlessness since
fighting a 21-month war of independence from Russia that ended when
Moscow withdrew its troops in 1996. The region is not recognized as
independent by any country, but Russia no longer exercises any
authority there.

Britain says it is not trying to oust Iraq's Saddam Hussein
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JAMAL HALABY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Britain favors a new government in Iraq,
but is not trying to overthrow President Saddam Hussein, a junior
British Cabinet minister said Tuesday.
	   ``It is not our task to choose the government in Iraq. We are
not in the business of trying to change the regime in Baghdad,''
said Derek Fatchett, British minister of state for foreign and
Commonwealth affairs, said.
	   But Britain is in the business of seeking to unite Iraqi
opposition groups to set the ground for a change of leadership in
Iraq, Fatchett told reporters after an hour-long meeting with
Jordan's Prime Minister Fayez Tarawneh.
	   Fatchett chaired one of two meetings that U.S. and British
officials held with 16 Iraqi dissident groups in London on Nov.
23-24. In the meetings, he and U.S. Assistant Secretary of State
Martin Indyk tried to encourage the fractious Iraqi opposition to
work together.
	   It would be a ``perverse person, indeed, who would argue that a
change of government will not necessarily be in the interest of the
Iraqi people,'' Fatchett said Tuesday.
	   The Iraqi opposition can ``project to those in the region, and
those in Europe and all parts of the world, what has happened in
Iraq under the leadership of Saddam Hussein in terms of disrespect
for human rights, the contempt for life and the abuse for human
rights.''
	   ``In addition to that, the Iraqi opposition can give an image of
a new Iraq, working together and showing that there can be
openness, pluralism and democracy,'' Fatchett said.
	   But, he added, the ``nature of the new government in Iraq, and
who leads it, is a decision for the Iraqi people.''
	   Fatchett, who arrived in Amman on Monday, is on a brief visit to
Jordan and Syria for talks that the British Embassy says will focus
on Iraq and the Middle East peace process.
	   He was scheduled to meet Crown Prince Hassan, who is acting as
regent while King Hussein is abroad, and fly late Tuesday to
Damascus for talks with the Syrian president and foreign minister.
	   Separately, former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark left Amman
for Iraq on Tuesday with dlrs 300,000 worth of medicine for cancer
and diabetes treatment. The trip is one of several that Clark has
made to take U.S.-donated drugs to Iraqi hospitals to alleviate the
shortages brought about by U.N. sanctions imposed since Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait in 1990.

	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ Chechen authorities found the decapitated
remains of four kidnapped foreigners Tuesday near a remote village
after a two-month search in the breakaway region in southern
Russia.
	   An Associated Press reporter saw four severed heads near the
village of Assinovskaya, about 40 kms (25 miles) west of Grozny,
the Chechen capital. He did not see any sign of the bodies.
	   The heads were identified as those of the four abducted
foreigners by Umar Makhauri, who had been a bodyguard assigned to
the four when they were abducted Oct. 3 by unidentified gunmen in
Grozny. He said the bodies had not been found.
	   Chechen government officials at the scene said four bodies had
been found, but gave no further details. Chechen President Aslan
Maskhadov said in Grozny that the bodies of four men had been
recovered, but gave no further details.
	   The hostages _ Britons Peter Kennedy, Darren Hickey, and Rudolf
Petschi, and New Zealand's Stanley Shaw _ were engineers. They were
working for Granger Telecom, a British telephone company,
installing 300,000 telephone lines across Chechnya.
	   Spokesmen at the British and New Zealand embassies in Moscow
said they were checking on reports the four men had been killed,
but could not comment.
	   The British Foreign Ministry in London said it was investigating
urgently reports that bodies had been found.
	   A spokesman for Granger Telecom in Britain said, ``We have heard
the reports and are obviously investigating, but there is nothing
we can say at this stage.''
	   Eamon Hickey, the father of one of the missing men, said he
heard the news and was hoping it would not be confirmed.
	   ``There is so much rumor and counter-rumor coming from out there
that we don't know what to think. Obviously we are hoping and
praying that it does not turn out to be true,'' he said at his home
in England.
	   Chechen authorities had been searching for the missing men for
the past two months. British officials said they had not received
any ransom demand for the missing men.
	   Maskhadov said the deaths of the four men were a major blow to
Chechnya and its efforts to gain international recognition of its
independence. He blamed the rash of abductions in Chechnya to
unidentified ``outside forces'' and their Chechen henchmen.
	   ``I am ready to answer before my people and the whole world for
what happened,'' he was quoted as saying by the Interfax news
agency.
	   Hostage-takings, usually for ransom, have become common in
Chechnya since the end of the breakaway republic's two-year war for
independence from Russia in 1996. But victims are rarely killed.
	   Since the beginning of 1998, 176 people have been kidnapped in
the North Caucasus region of Russia, including dozens of
foreigners, and 90 of them released, officials have said.

Teachers strike over pay dispute in Niger
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NIAMEY, Niger (AP) _ Unions for Niger's 17,000 secondary and
primary school teachers ordered schools closed for 5 days to
pressure the government into paying overdue salaries, said a union
statement issued Tuesday.
	   The strike started Monday, with most teachers participating and
most schools closed. Children who went to their schools in the
capital Niamey and elsewhere where turned away and sent home.
	   The teachers have not been paid since May this year despite
repeated appeals to the government.
	   The strike threatened to worsen the nation's already troubled
educational sector. Already, the government has been forced to
delay opening schools this year for over a month.
	   Many civil servants and soldiers have also not been paid by the
government for months.
	   Niger, one of the world's poorest countries, also has one of the
lowest literacy rates.

Serb monastery survives in heart of rebel territory
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DEVIC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Amid shattered villages and abandoned
homes in rebel-controlled territory in Kosovo, a lone Serb
monastery survives.
	   Although cut off from the world, their phone and electricity
lines severed in battles that raged around them for months, the
nine nuns at the Serbian Orthodox monastery of Devic are determined
to stay put.
	   ``The police advised us to go,'' says Sister Epraksija, 70,
recalling when Serb forces withdrew in October, complying with a
U.S.-sponsored peace agreement.
	   But she won't _ Devic has been her only home for 50 years.
	   The horrors in this violent Serbian province haven't driven them
away. Only two villages away, in Prekaz, Serb forces last March
killed 83 ethnic Albanians, including women and children, raising
fears the nuns could be targeted in retribution.
	   But the separatist guerrillas haven't harmed them yet, although
stones are sometimes hurled through their windows and there have
been ominous knockings at the gate at night.
	   Epraksija says the nuns are more wary since ``our Serb army went
away,'' but she believes the worst is over.
	   Unlike other Serbian Orthodox monasteries that dot Kosovo's
undulating countryside, closer to the province's towns, Devic
spells fear to Kosovo's minority Serbs because of its location in
the center of Drenica.
	   The Drenica region is the cradle of ethnic Albanian resistance
to the Serbian regime, where Serb forces last February launched
their bloody campaign against Kosovo's rebels.
	   Evidence of months of destruction is everywhere. Destroyed
houses of once-thriving villages line the desolate roadsides.
	   Amid the rubble, the few refugees who returned home when the
fighting subsided are scrambling to survive.
	   From the ruins of Lausa village, populated solely by ethnic
Albanians who make up 90 percent of the province's population, a
narrow paved road leads to Devic, tucked away in the hills.
	   Guerrillas of the Kosovo Liberation Army, their camouflage
uniforms emblazoned with KLA's bright orange insignia, move about
freely here. But Epraksija says she's glimpsed them only once.
	   ``There is nothing to stop their gangs from murdering us at
night if they wanted to. God and Saint Janicije give us strength,''
she says, referring to the monastery's patron saint, a Serb martyr
whose remains are buried here.
	   Believed to have healing powers for troubled souls, he is the
prime reason the nuns are determined to stay.
	   They believe their saint's powers intervened when a grenade hit
the monastery wall in August but caused minimal damage. A miracle,
Epraksija says.
	   No other Serbs live within miles (kilometers) of the nuns.
	   ``We never go there,'' says an ethnic Albanian villager, loading
bricks onto a cart.
	   Behind the monastery's squeaky wooden gate, five tail-wagging
dogs accompany Sister Epraksija, in simple black garb, as she steps
into the yard with an unhurried, limping gait.
	   Shy around strangers, eyes downcast, her natural hospitality
slowly rises to the surface as she proudly shows off the
monastery's 13th-century frescoes.
	   In the medieval dining room, Sister Apipina brings a pot of
fresh coffee and offers plum brandy made by the nuns to guests
sitting at a long oak table.
	   Apipina, who came here from Bosnia 39 years ago, worries how the
nuns will survive Kosovo's bitter winter. The fighting ruined this
year's crop and none dare venture out to the monastery's farm or
forest. Their firewood supply is running out.
	   Sister Anastasija drives weekly to nearby Srbica for groceries.
Her car, the nuns' only link to the outside world, was once fired
at by a KLA patrol but no one was hurt.
	   The sisters refuse to talk politics. Even Andja, 60, the
monastery helper who looks after her nuns and dogs with equal
passion, claims she's ignorant of politicians and their
negotiations.
	   Their greatest worry is the wood stove that was just stolen from
their backyard.
	   Will the fighting break out again in spring?
	   Epraksija doesn't think so.
	   ``Oh yes it will,'' Apipina contradicts her superior. ``It will
happen all over again.''

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine stocks fell Tuesday,
dragged down by declines in the property sector caused by renewed
fears of higher interest rates, traders said.
	   The peso, meanwhile, closed higher against the U.S. dollar
because of strong dollar inflows from investors and Filipinos
working overseas, dealers said.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index fell 18.51 points,
or 1 percent, to 1,815.85. On Monday it gained 11.72 points.
	   Shares of Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co. topped the list
of actively traded stocks, falling 20 pesos, or 2 percent, to 1,000
pesos.
	   Traders said stocks were weighed down by claims from former
first lady Imelda Marcos that her family owns virtually all key
businesses in the country, including PLDT.
	   Concern that Marcos intends to recover the companies through
lawsuits made investors wary of bidding up shares of contested
firms.
	   Meanwhile, property issues Ayala Land and Filinvest Land were
hurt by fears of another round of interest rate increases following
Monday's treasury bill auction.
	   Ayala Land shares fell 50 centavos, or 4.8 percent, to 10 pesos,
while Filinvest Land shares fell 5 centavos, or 1.8 percent, to
2.80 pesos.
	   The government rejected most bids during the T-bond auction,
which were believed to have been too high.
	   ``The high bids during the auction were caused by the
higher-than-expected inflation rate for November,'' said Astro del
Castillo, analyst for A and A Securities Inc.
	   Last Friday, the government reported an inflation rate of 11.2
percent for November, up from October's 10.2 percent.
	   Property companies are vulnerable to high interest rates, which
raise the cost of loans and mortgages.
	   The main index weakened by as much as 38.05 points at
mid-session, prompting bargain-hunters to swoop down for some
oversold stocks shortly before trading ended and helping trim the
market's loss, said Ian Kane, trader for Anscor-Hagedorn Securities
Inc.
	   Declining issues exceeded gainers 83 to 23 while 31 were
unchanged.
	   In currency trading, the dollar averaged 38.983 pesos for the
day, down 0.8 percent from Monday's 39.313 pesos. It traded in a
wide range of 38.740 pesos to 39.400 pesos and last changed hands
at 38.810 pesos.
	   Traders noted that a substantial portion of the dollar inflows
appeared to be from foreign direct investors, as these transactions
were done through foreign banks.
	   Remittances of Filipinos working overseas usually pass through
local banks, particularly the Philippine National Bank, which is
partly state-owned.
	   The Philippine Central Bank wasn't active in the spot market. It
held its overnight borrowing and lending rates at 13.375 percent
and 15.375 percent, respectively.

High expectations may haunt Venezuela's president-elect
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BART JONES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ Hugo Chavez stood on a terrace
overlooking thousands of roaring supporters as floodlights lit the
midnight air and a 100-foot-long (30-meter-long) Venezuelan flag
flapped below him.
	   It was hours after the former coup leader had won Venezuela's
presidential election by a landslide.
	   ``The resurrection of Venezuela has begun, and nothing and no
one can stop it,'' he bellowed over loudspeakers Sunday.
	   The 44-year-old former paratrooper is a messiah to millions of
poor people who believe he will punish the corrupt, wipe out misery
and return the oil-rich country to the days when it was dubbed
``Saudi Venezuela.''
	   But those expectations may be too high for Chavez's own good.
	   ``People think they are going to start eating better and living
better on Feb. 3,'' the day after Chavez is sworn in, said
historian Guillermo Moron. ``But that's not true.''
	   Chavez, who has never held public office, is inheriting a
country with an economy in shambles and a political establishment
that views him as a villain because of his 1992 attempt to
overthrow the government.
	   ``Depressed oil prices and high un- and under-employment mean
that the next government will face some very difficult problems,
and it will take political skill, courage and resolution to deal
with them successfully,'' U.S. Ambassador John Maisto said.
	   The economy went into a tailspin earlier this year when oil
prices hit a 12-year low. Venezuela relies on oil for 75 percent of
its export revenue and over half the government budget, which has
been slashed by dlrs 2 billion this year.
	   Next year isn't expected to be much better. Oil prices are
likely to remain low, provoking more budget cuts.
	   Yet Chavez has already announced that he wants to boost the
current minimum monthly wage of dlrs 175 that is barely half of
what workers need to feed, clothe and house a family of five, by
official estimate.
	   The question is: where will the money come from?
	   Many workers are employed by the government. Its 1.3
million-person payroll is one of the most bloated in Latin America.
	   Chavez says he wants to streamline the bureaucracy, but laid-off
workers won't find new jobs if the economy doesn't turn around.
More than half of Venezuela's population of 23 million already is
mired in poverty.
	   Venezuela has Latin America's highest annual inflation rate at
30 percent. Looming in the immediate future is intense pressure to
devalue of the currency, the bolivar, and the possibility of a new
banking crisis. The financial system nearly collapsed in 1994-95
and required a dlrs 7 billion bailout.
	   Chavez ``will face tremendous macroeconomic difficulties in his
first year in office,'' said Andres Mata, editor of El Universal
newspaper.
	   Venezuela's new head of state could also encounter troubles in
the political arena. His leftist Patriotic Pole coalition won a
plurality in Nov. 8 congressional elections, but opposing parties
still control a majority of seats.
	   Chavez wants to convene a constituent assembly to rewrite the
constitution and possibly dissolve Congress.
	   That will likely revive many of the hostilities that erupted
during the campaign, which polarized the country between rich and
poor and between the Patriotic Pole and Venezuela's two traditional
parties.
	   ``We could have the country thrown into a political upheaval for
a year and not be able to do anything,'' Moron said.
	   Venezuelans might lose patience if that happens. Many people
yearn for a return to the 1970s oil booms when four 747s a day took
off from Simon Bolivar International Airport to spirit Venezuelans
to Miami for weekend shopping sprees.
	   Working-class families could afford to eat out once a week, and
the poor popped open bottles of champagne on New Year's Eve.
	   Chavez may have to put his famed charisma to use to persuade
Venezuelans to show patience.
	   ``The rear-guard stabs at reform haven't gotten anywhere because
nobody has been able to capture the trust of the Venezuelan
people,'' said political consultant Eric Ekvall. ``If anyone has
this quality, it's Hugo Chavez.''

New in China: government solicits comment via Internet
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RENEE SCHOOF &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ In the week since the Chinese government went to
the Internet for the first time to solicit public opinion, it has
been deluged with ideas about how to lead China into the future.
	   Some have appealed for a serious effort to eliminate corruption.
Others want more spending on education. One called the exercise a
waste of time until the government grants Chinese real freedom of
speech.
	   All views considered, the State Development Planning Commission
believes the government's first foray hosting an Internet forum has
been positive, commission official Sun Guojun said Tuesday.
	   Since the commission opened the site Dec. 1 to solicit views for
China's next five-year plan, 3,000 users have checked it out and
about a third of them have left comments.
	   Sun said 80 percent of the comments were positive, and about 20
percent were dissenting ideas, mostly from people outside China.
	   China's Communist Party leaders have a love-hate relationship
with the Internet. They want to harness it for modern commerce, yet
remain wary of its power to spread dissent. Last week, the
government put a computer entrepreneur on trial for subversion for
sending 30,000 Chinese e-mail addresses to an on-line democracy
magazine edited in the United States.
	   The State Development Planning Commission's Chinese-language
forum asks for suggestions about what people want from economic
development and how the government should guide the economy.
Guidelines for participants warn against making anti-government
statements.
	   Responses cover a broad range of ideas about what is ailing
China, and while some toe the government line, others are blunt. In
calling for a real attack on rampant corruption, one noted that
``saying this is easy but doing it is as hard as ascending to
heaven.''
	   Some said China had to solve farmers' problems first. Incomes
have been lagging in rural China, where the majority of the
nation's 1.2 billion people live.
	   Another complained that while the Communist Party's rhetoric
says the people are the masters of the state, in fact people don't
dare give their opinions about how the country is governed. Even if
they do speak up, no one in government cares, the writer added,
concluding with a call for freedom of speech.
	   Confined largely to academics just four years ago, the Internet
is booming in China, with about 1.2 million registered users. To
keep the network under control, China has set up special police
task forces and uses filters to try to block out the subversive and
the pornographic.
	   Internet forums and chat sites are nothing new in China.
Provinces and Chinese companies use the Internet to get information
out and solicit business, and many Chinese newspapers have home
pages on the Internet. But the planning commission's forum marked
the first time the government has turned to the Internet to canvass
the public.
	   Other government agencies also plan to go online soon. Officials
have dubbed 1999 the year the Chinese government goes on the Net,
the China Youth Daily reported on Sunday.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Yang Xia broke the world records for
clean and jerk and total lift Tuesday as she won gold for China in
women's 53-kilogram weightlifting at the Asian Games.
	   Yang's 120.0 kilograms in the clean and jerk broke the mark of
117.5 set by China's Wang Xiufen last month. Her total of 212.5
also eclipsed a mark set by Wang _ 210.0.
	   Taiwan's Li Feng-ying won the silver with a total of 202.5, and
Myanmar's Swe Swe Win took bronze with 197.5. Indonesia's Supeni
also lifted 197.5, but missed a medal because of heavier body
weight.
	   Yang lifted her 120.0 clean and jerk on her second attempt, and
did not try a third lift after her coach suggested the record was
good enough.
	   It was China's second world record of these games. On Monday,
Liu Xiuhua lifted 83.5 in the snatch of the women's 48-kilogram
division, beating the world mark of 83.0 set by compatriot Li Zhuo
on Sept. 16.

Israeli settlers take another hill, badger Netanyahu for security

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Jewish settlers moved five mobile homes to an
isolated hilltop Tuesday in the latest effort to hold onto land
ahead of the next Israeli troop withdrawal in the West Bank.
	   The seizing of the hill about half a mile (one kilometer) from
the Jewish settlement of Bracha settlement came just days before
U.S. President Bill Clinton was to arrive in the Middle East.
	   Clinton will try to prod Israel and the Palestinians to overcome
differences and resume implementation of the Wye River peace accord
under which Israel is to withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   Since the Wye River agreement was signed, settlers have begun
taking up positions on hilltops to keep as much land as possible.
	   ``If we don't live there, the Arabs will live there,'' said
Vered Ben-Saadon, 22, who has moved to the hill outside Bracha. ``I
hope soon that settlers will live on the hills all around Bracha.''
	   Peter Lerner, a spokesman for the Israeli military government in
the West Bank, said the hill was located inside the settlement
limits and that moving the trailers there was not against the law.
	   Residents of the Kadim and Ganim settlements _ located near
areas of the northern West Bank that were turned over to the
Palestinians in November _ met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu on Tuesday to demand better protection.
	   A Ganim settler was wounded Monday night in a drive-by shooting,
apparently by Palestinian militants.
	   Settlers said after the meeting that they were skeptical about
Netanyahu's assurances that he would accelerate the construction of
bypass roads for them and increase army patrols in the area.
	   ``Things are real tough,'' said Suzanna Tzvetlitz who has lived
in Ganim for 14 years. ``These are promises that we have heard
before. We leave here (from the prime minister's office) with heavy
hearts.''

NATO ministers keep level of Bosnia force unchanged
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - NATO foreign ministers agreed Tuesday
to leave NATO-led multinational peacekeeping force in Bosnia at its
current 32,000-troop level.
	   The Bosnia Stabilization Force, SFOR, ``cannot be maintained
indefinitely nor does it reduce the responsibility of the
authorities (in Bosnia) to ensure the stability of their country,''
the ministers said in a statement.
	   They also said one of the key tasks for 1999 would be to
accelerate the return of refugees to areas where they represent an
ethnic minority.
	   The return of refugees to their homes has been slow since the
three-year war ended in December 1995 with the signing of the
Dayton peace accord.
	   Many Bosnian Muslims returning to areas where they are a
minority have faced ethnic tensions. Often they find their houses
have been destroyed or that Serb families have moved in.
	   The statement said much had been achieved in rebuilding Bosnia
since the war. But there is ``still much to be done to reinforce
the fragile democracy taking root'' in the country, it added.
	   Areas that require particular effort are the establishment of
the rule of law, the development of common institutions for the
state, the fight against corruption, and ethnic integration.

Officials: Bodies of four kidnapped foreigners found

<TEXT>
	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ Chechen authorities found the decapitated
remains of four kidnapped foreigners today near a remote village
after a two-month search in the breakaway region in southern
Russia.
	   An Associated Press reporter saw four severed heads near the
village of Assinovskaya, about 25 miles west of Grozny, the Chechen
capital. He did not see any sign of the bodies.
	   The heads were identified by Umar Makhauri as those of the four
abducted engineers. Makhauri was a bodyguard assigned to the three
Britons and one New Zealander when they were abducted Oct. 3 by
unidentified gunmen in Grozny. He said the bodies had not been
found.
	   Chechen government officials at the scene said four bodies had
been found, but gave no further details. Chechen President Aslan
Maskhadov said in Grozny that the bodies of four men had been
recovered, but also gave no further details.
	   The hostages _ Britons Peter Kennedy, Darren Hickey, and Rudolf
Petschi, and New Zealand's Stanley Shaw _ were engineers. They were
working for Granger Telecom, a British telephone company,
installing 300,000 telephone lines across Chechnya.
	   Spokesmen at the British and New Zealand embassies in Moscow
said they were checking on reports the four men had been killed,
but could not comment.
	   The British Foreign Ministry in London said it was investigating
reports the bodies had been found.
	   A spokesman for Granger Telecom in Britain said, ``We have heard
the reports and are obviously investigating, but there is nothing
we can say at this stage.''
	   Eamon Hickey, the father of one of the missing men, said he
heard the news and was hoping it would not be confirmed.
	   ``There is so much rumor and counter-rumor coming from out there
that we don't know what to think. Obviously we are hoping and
praying that it does not turn out to be true,'' he said at his home
in England.
	   Chechen authorities had been searching for the missing men for
the past two months. British officials said they had not received
any ransom demand for the missing men.
	   Maskhadov said the deaths of the four men were a major blow to
Chechnya and its efforts to gain international recognition of its
independence. He blamed the rash of abductions in Chechnya to
unidentified ``outside forces'' and their Chechen henchmen.
	   ``I am ready to answer before my people and the whole world for
what happened,'' he was quoted as saying by the Interfax news
agency.
	   Hostage-takings, usually for ransom, have become common in
Chechnya since the end of the breakaway republic's two-year war for
independence from Russia in 1996. But victims are rarely killed.
	   Since the beginning of 1998, 176 people have been kidnapped in
the North Caucasus region of Russia, including dozens of
foreigners, and 90 of them released, officials have said.

At last, coach signs new contract
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Having guided Arsenal to the league and FA Cup
double last season, the Gunners' French coach Arsene Wenger ended
speculation about his future on Tuesday when he signed a new 3 1/2
year contract.
	   Wenger had delayed signing, prompting speculation that he might
not stay. Arsenal owners had been trying since the end of the last
season to get him to sign a new deal and the delay had sparked
interest from other big European clubs, notably Spanish soccer
giants Real Madrid and Barcelona.
	   Wenger has said all along that he wasn't interested in moving
and that signing would be a formality once small details had been
sorted out.
	   ``I gave my word long ago, and that was more important than my
signature,'' he said Tuesday. ``But I've signed now because
everybody outside wanted it.
	   ``There have been other clubs overseas who have been in for me,
but I always said that my future was at Arsenal.''
	   Arsenal vice-chairman David Dein said there was no danger of
Wenger leaving the club.
	   ``It's no surprise (that he's signed), but obviously we are
delighted,'' Dein said. ``It was just a question of tidying up a
few loose ends.''
	   Ravaged by injuries, Arsenal has struggled in recent weeks. The
Gunners haven't scored in five of their last six games, have been
eliminated from the Champions League and lie fourth in the Premier
League standings.
	   Wenger came in for criticism last week when he said Arsenal fans
were spoiled after last year's success.
	   ``If you eat caviar every day, sometimes it is difficult to come
back to sausages and mash,'' he said.

Party that set up apartheid changes name
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ ``What's in a name?'' playwright
William Shakespeare once asked.
	   A lot, it seems, when you need to get blacks to vote for a party
that set up apartheid and instituted decades of racial oppression.
	   Seeking to overcome its image, the former ruling National Party
said Tuesday it was officially changing its name to the New
National Party. Its leader, Marthinus van Schalkwyk, said the party
has applied to the Independent Electoral Commission participate in
next year's national elections under the new name.
	   Politicians had already been adding ``New'' before National
Party in speeches and it has been on the party's letterhead for
several months. Tuesday's announcement makes the change official.
	   ``With this move the New National Party has established itself
as a future-orientated party,'' van Schalkwyk declared.
	   The National Party swept to power in 1948, riding on a wave of
votes from Afrikaners, the descendants of Dutch settlers.
	   Under the party's apartheid system of government, millions of
blacks were moved into ``homelands'' and allowed to work in South
Africa only if they carried a pass.
	   Amid pressure from black liberation movements and international
sanctions, the party was forced into gradual reforms, eventualy
resulting in 1994's all-race elections which marked the end of
white rule and which swept the African National Ccongress into
power.
	   The National Party performed better than expected in the 1994
election, retaining control of one of South Africa's nine
provinces. But it has struggled in the past four years.
	   Despite appointing blacks and people of mixed race to prominent
positions, it is still unpopular with blacks, who make up 77
percent of the population.
	   Latest opinion polls show the party with 10 percent support,
down from 16 percent shortly after the 1994 election.

South Korea beats Japan 29-14 in Rugby Seven final

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with gold medal game &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ After dropping behind 14-0, South Korea
scored 29 unanswered points to beat Japan 29-14 Tuesday for the
gold medal of seven-man rugby at the Asian Games.
	   Japan took the lead almost immediately when Tsutomu Matsuda ran
almost the length of the field to score a try. Keisuke Sawaki made
the conversion.
	   Three minutes later, Sawaki scored a try himself and added the
conversion, making it 14-0 for Japan.
	   South Korea started its comeback two minutes later. Yoo Min-suk
did a superb fake at midfield and took it in for a try. The
conversion by Sung Hae-Kung made it 14-7.
	   South Korea tied the match a minute later when Kim Hyung-ki made
a try at the end of the half and Sung converted.
	   In the second half, South Korea kept the pressure on and scored
with a relentless attack at the goal line. Kang Dong-ho carried the
ball in for a try and Sung added the conversion.
	   Sung scored four minutes later, breaking out of a pack, and
again converted, bringing the score to 26-14.
	   Sung capped his performance in the the final minute with a
drop-kick worth three points.
	   Thailand beat Taiwan 19-5 for the bronze medal, and Hong Kong
defeated Kazakstan 14-12 for fifth place.
	   In the semifinals, South Korea yielded an early try to Thailand,
but pulled ahead 7-5 by halftime and won 28-10.
	   Japan scored two converted first-half tries for a 14-0 shutout
of Taiwan.

Indonesian president forms council to handle security
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Indonesia
 &UR; By HARIS SYAMAUN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) - Indonesian President B.J. Habibie on
Tuesday formed a national council to oversee security in the
Southeast Asian country, which has been beset by sporadic riots and
near-daily student protests.
	   But government critics immediately assailed the establishment of
the panel as an undemocratic move.
	   The 32-member council includes Cabinet ministers, human rights
officials, military and religious leaders and other delegates,
State Secretary Akbar Tanjung said.
	   ``This is a kind of crisis center to deal with all security and
law enforcement matters,'' Tanjung said of the panel, to be called
the Council for the Maintenance of Security and Law Enforcement.
	   The military, its reputation tarnished by human rights abuses,
has been hard-pressed to keep order in the sprawling archipelago
nation of 202 million people.
	   Students have been protesting for swifter political reforms in
the wake of the resignation in May of former President Suharto
after 32 years of authoritarian rule. Last month, protesters fought
deadly battles with police and soldiers in Jakarta.
	   Indonesia's worst economic crisis in decades has stripped
millions of people of their jobs and prompted riots over price
increases.
	   Religious tension has also led to outbreaks of church- and
mosque-burning in recent weeks. Indonesia is predominantly Muslim,
with 10 percent of the population practicing Christian, Buddhist
and other faiths.
	   Tanjung did not describe the duties of the council, which was
formed under a presidential decree.
	   One of its members, military chief Gen. Wiranto, will handle the
council's daily operations. Its headquarters will be at the defense
ministry, which Wiranto heads.
	   A human rights lawyer said the panel was undemocratic because it
formed without consulting Parliament.
	   ``The problem is that whatever is set up by the government at
the moment isn't trusted by the people,'' said Bambang Widjojanto,
chairman of the Indonesian Legal Aid Foundation.
	   Suharto twice set up similar councils while in power, drawing
criticism from human rights workers who said the panels simply gave
the government more power to crack down on dissent.
	   Under Suharto, a defense council also screened candidates for
legislative elections to make sure they were free of communist
influence. Suharto rose to power after crushing an alleged
communist coup attempt in 1965.
	   Habibie, who has scheduled general elections in June, has
promised to implement democratic reforms, but students say he is
not moving fast enough.
	   Tanjung said the first meeting of the council would be held in
late December after Habibie returns from a trip to Vietnam for a
summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.

	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Swedish brothers Mathias and Thobias
Fredriksson placed first and third in the men's knock-out sprint
Tuesday for an impressive family showing in the second World Cup
event of the ski coss-country season.
	   Mathias' first World Cup victory vaulted him atop the overall
standings following his fourth place in the season opener at
Muonio, Finland, last month.
	   Fredriksson, 25, defeated Germany's Peter Schlickenrieder in the
final at an indoor meet in this northern city.
	   The German skier, who was leading the favored Swede, took the
wrong way in the next-to-last of the four laps and gave clear way
to Mathias Fredriksson.
	   Thobias Fredriksson, downed by his brother in the semifinal
round, beat Odd-Bjorn Hjelmeset of Norway for third place.
	   Sweden's Per Oloffson, winner of the 10-kilmeter freestyle race
in Muonio, was eliminated in the very first round.
	   Norway's Anita Moen-Guidon won the women's final as Andreja Mali
of Slovenia fell a few meters from the finish line, while leading
the opponent by one meter.
	   Another Norwegian skier, Bente Martisen, took third place ahead
of Italy's Karin Moroder.
	   The Milan sprint race, on artificial snow, was deserted by the
top Russian skiers and by Norwegian great Bjorn Dahlie.
	   The next round of World Cup races is scheduled at Toblach,
Italy, this weekend.

Teen-age gymnasts give China sweep of Asian Games team golds
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Somersaulting, jumping and vaulting in
a league of their own, China's teen-age women gymanasts captured
team gold Tuesday at the Asian Games, giving China its seventh
consecutive sweep of both the men and women's team events.
	   Japan captured silver, bettering the bronze clinched by the
men's team in its close battle with South Korea on Monday.
Kazakstan took bronze.
	   But it was the Chinese in their bright yellow and red outfits
who stole the evening. After just two of the four disciplines, the
Chinese had opened a five-point gap over the Japanese and were
already giving each other high fives.
	   By the end of the competition, the gap was more than seven
points.
	   Four members of the squad had captured team bronze at last
year's World Championships, but the newcomers were impressive too.
	   Xu Jing, a 16-year-old who has been with the national team just
six months, scored 9.8 with a nearly flawless display of soaring
somersaults and grace on the floor.
	   Ling Jie, another 16-year-old in just her second major
competition, broke into a beaming smile after an excellent uneven
bars routine that scored 9.825.
	   Veteran Liu Xuan, the team's oldest member at 19, also was
delighted after an almost flawless routine on the balance beam that
finished with a soaring double somersault and scored 9.85.
	   ``No problem there,'' said Qian Kui, the head coach. ``She
didn't wobble.''
	   The team's strong performance cleared the way for the
possibility of more medals for China in the individual
competitions. The top 24 gymnasts qualify for Wednesday's contest
to find the best all-around gymnast, and the top eight in each
discipline also qualify for apparatus finals Thursday.
	   China's women won all the gymnastics gold medals at the last
Asian Games in Hiroshima, Japan, in 1984. The men and women have
also won every team event since 1974.
	   North Korea, back in the Asian Games after skipping 1994,
fielded a team including some members who looked overly young.
	   Coaches, doctors and officials questioned whether some of the
tiny North Korean girls, who urged each other on with high-pitched
squeals, had reached the regulation age of 16.
	   ``They look noticeably young,'' said Jackie Fie, an official
from the sport's governing body, the FIG. ``They look 11.''
	   ``Not yet,'' she replied when asked whether any of the other
teams had complained.

Yemen army surrounds kidnappers of four Germans, makes arrests
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AHMAD Al-HAJ &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Security forces have surrounded the area
where kidnappers are holding four Germans, three of them women, and
have arrested nine members of the tribe believed to be responsible,
tribal and security officials said Tuesday.
	   The security forces began detaining members of the Bani Dhabyan
tribe late Monday in a bid to gain leverage in negotiations with
tribal elders, a tribesman said on condition of anonymity.
	   San`a Governor Naji al-Soufi arrived Tuesday in Marib, where the
Germans are being held, to negotiate their release, said
Abdul-Rahman Mahyoub, director of the tourism board.
	   More than 250 troops in armored vehicles have encircled the
mountainous area where the Germans are believed held, security
officials said, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   The area is near Serwah, in Marib province, which is 170
kilometers (105 miles) northeast of the capital San`a.
	   Three gunmen, believed to be from the Bani Dhabyan tribe,
abducted the Germans on Monday. They were part of a group of tour
operators who were invited to Yemen by a local travel agent.
	   They were looking over tourist sites with a view to bringing
German tour groups to the country, said a member of the tourist
police. He also spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   The Germans apparently were on their way back to San`a after a
trip through central Yemen when they were kidnapped.
	   They were forced into the kidnappers' truck on the main road
between San`a and the Dhamar province, about 100 kilometers (62
miles) south of the capital.
	   Security officials say the tribe carried out the abduction to
try to force the government to pay them for land on which it built
a damn.
	   The Bani Dhabyan tribe has carried out numerous kidnappings,
including the seizure in April of a British teacher, his wife and
their 14-year old son.
	   Armed tribesmen, who control large parts of Yemen, frequently
kidnap foreigners to try to win concessions from the government.
The hostages are usually well treated and released unharmed.

Caribbean Community chairman urges greater role for Haiti
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MICHAEL NORTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ The chairman of the Caribbean
Community trade group has arrived in Haiti urging a greater role
for the group's newest member country despite a paralyzing
political deadlock.
	   Chairman Kenny Anthony, who is the prime minister of St. Lucia,
was slated to meet with executive branch officials and members of
the business community.
	   ``We are very anxious in the Caribbean Community to facilitate
Haiti's membership and accession to the community,'' Anthony said
upon arrival Monday.
	   Haiti joined the 15-member community in July 1997, but its
participation has been hobbled by 18 months without a working
government.
	   Anthony led a five-member delegation that included Caribbean
Community secretary-general Edwin Carrington. He was met at the
airport by President Rene Preval and Foreign Relations Minister
Fritz Longchamps.
	   Regional leaders at a recent summit in Barbados urged the group,
fresh from its success in brokering a political truce in racially
divided Guyana, to intervene in Haiti.
	   However, Longchamps said Monday Anthony would not be taking the
role of peacemaker.
	   ``The visit of the delegation is to accelerate our integration
in the Caribbean Community,'' Longchamps told the Associated Press.
``It is not here to mediate a solution of our political problems.''
	   Community Chairman Anthony led a five-member delegation that
included Community Secretary-General Edwin Carrington.
	   The delegation was to meet Tuesday with business leaders and the
commission that coordinates Haitian relations with the trade group.
	   A meeting with Haitian lawmakers was not scheduled, the Haitian
presidential press service said. Parliament members, who are locked
in a political struggle with Preval, said Monday they had not been
notified of the visit.
	   ``Preval is playing the same old power game. We had no idea the
Caribbean Community chairman was coming,'' Senate president Sen.
Edgard Leblanc told The Associated Press Monday morning.
	   Since June 1997, when then-Premier Rosny Smarth resigned in
protest of elections allegedly slanted in favor of allies of former
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the struggle between Smarth's
majority party and Preval has blocked the installation of a new
government.
	   The approval of Preval's fourth choice for premier, education
minister Jacques-Edouard Alexis, has been tied up in technicalities
over his eligibility. It is unlikely that a parliamentary vote will
occur this year, and Alexis' chances of ultimately being approved
are slim.
	   The stalemate has blocked legislation and prevented passage of a
budget for two consecutive years. Foreign investors have shied
away, and millions of dollars in foreign aid are being withheld.
	   With an estimated population of 8 million, Haiti has more people
than the other Caribbean Community nations combined.
Creole-speaking Haiti and Dutch-speaking Suriname are the only
non-English-speaking member nations.
	   However, Anthony also spoke in Creole at International Airport
since, in addition to English, many St. Lucians speak a
French-Creole dialect.
	   The delegation will leave Haiti Wednesday.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) - At least 2,000 chanting students on
Tuesday staged a string of protests around Indonesia's capital city
to press their demand that former President Suharto be put on
trial.
	   President B.J. Habibie, meanwhile, formed a new national council
to oversee security in the Southeast Asian country, which has
endured sporadic riots and near-daily protests for months.
	   The 32-member council includes Cabinet ministers, human rights
officials, military and religious leaders and other delegates,
State Secretary Akbar Tanjung said.
	   He did not specify the duties of the panel, which was formed
under a presidential decree and drew immediate criticism from human
rights lawyers who said Parliament should have been consulted.
	   In Jakarta, the capital, separate bands of activists rallied
near Parliament and outside the police headquarters and the
attorney general's office. Riot police blocked one group trying to
march to Suharto's house.
	   ``Hang Suharto,'' shouted students who have demanded for months
that the 77-year-old former army general be charged with corruption
and human rights abuses. After 32 years of authoritarian rule, he
quit in May amid civil unrest and political turmoil.
	   Several small tanks parked near the presidential palace and
security forces sealed off roads in the area.
	   About 300 students rallied outside the Jakarta police
headquarters against the early morning arrest of two students
during a police raid at Indonesian Christian University.
	   The detainees were suspected of involvement in the abduction of
a plainclothes officer at a demonstration on Nov. 27. The officer
was taken away in a taxi, roughed up and released several hours
later.
	   Student demonstrators who helped oust Suharto say Habibie is
shirking his pledge to investigate his former mentor, who was
scheduled to appear Wednesday for questioning at the office of
Attorney General Andi Mohammad Ghalib.
	   Some students who gathered there shook the locked gates to the
compound, which was occupied by protesters for one day last month.
Police and soldiers stood nearby but did not intervene.
	   Inside, prosecutors questioned Tunky Ariwibowo, a former trade
and industry minister who has been accused of providing perks that
enriched the business empires of Suharto's children.
	   Tunky was asked about his role in a so-called ``national car''
project, through which Suharto's son, Hutomo Mandala Putra, was
licensed to import cars from Korea's Kia Motors Corp. without
having to pay import tariffs.
	   Habibie, a former research and technology minister, has been
implementing political reforms and has pledged to fight government
graft that thrived under Suharto, whose wealth was estimated by
Forbes magazine at dlrs 4 billion.
	   But critics say Habibie, whose family owns dozens of businesses,
has not moved fast enough on democratic change and has been too
compromised by his links to the old regime to wipe out corruption
that contributed to Indonesia's economic crisis.
	   Ghalib questioned Suharto several months ago during an earlier
investigation that failed to find any evidence against the former
president. Students said it was a whitewash.
	   Also Tuesday, The Jakarta Post reported that corrupt practices
have cost the country 1.7 trillion rupiah (dlrs 225 million) in
lost revenues since Habibie took office.
	   The losses were primarily in the departments of mines and
energy, public works, culture and education and transportation, the
Post said. It cited Soedarjono, head of the government's internal
audit department.
	   Indonesia, a nation of 202 million people, has been beset by
high unemployment and inflation. Many riots this year stemmed from
economic hardship, but ethnic and religious tensions have also
fueled violence.

Disgraced directors reinstated on Newcastle board
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEWCASTLE, England (AP) _ They're back.
	   Freddy Shepherd and Douglas Hall were reappointed to Newcastle's
controlling board Tuesday _ seven months after resigning in
disgrace for insulting the club's fans, the city's women and star
striker Alan Shearer.
	   Shepherd and Hall won back their places on the Newcastle plc
board at the end of the company's stormy annual general meeting.
	   The company chairman, Denis Cassidy, and non-executive directors
Tom Fenton and John Josephs resigned in protest at the return of
Shepherd and Hall.
	   Newcastle's stockbrokers, BT Alex Brown, also quit.
	   The company said chief executive Freddie Fletcher will take over
as acting chairman until the position is filled permanently, and
another independent director will also be appointed.
	   Hall and Shepherd left both the soccer board and company board
last season after being caught on film mocking Newcastle fans for
paying high prices for club merchandise, describing Newcastle women
as ``dogs'' and calling Shearer ``Mary Poppins.''
	   The pair returned to their positions as chairman and deputy
chairman of the soccer board in July. But their return to the main
company board was not foreseen.
	   But with a shareholding in excess of 60 percent between their
companies, Shepherd and Hall were able to force their way back onto
the board.
	   Newcastle shares on the London stock market fell by more than 3
percent at the news of the two directors' return.
	   Some analysts speculated the club would now have to be taken off
the stock market and into the private hands of Hall and Shepherd.

Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets closed mixed Tuesday, with
prices rising in Tokyo and Bangkok but falling in Hong Kong and
Taipei. Thai share prices closed sharply higher as foreigners
pitched into the market, buying blue chip shares across the board,
traders said. The Stock Exchange of Thailand index gained 12.64
points, or 3.7 percent, to close at 350.27. Share prices in Hong
Kong closed lower as investors took profits following sharp gains.
The Hang Seng Index, the market's key indicator of blue chip
stocks, fell 77.74 points, or 0.7 percent, closing at 10,351.08.
Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 84.71
points, or 0.58 percent, to close the day at 14,808.20. Meanwhile,
the U.S. dollar was quoted at 119.86 yen in late afternoon trading,
up 0.90 yen from late Monday in Tokyo and also above its late New
York level of 119.81 yen overnight. (ASIAN MARKETS)
	   ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ Gulf Arab oil ministers
agreed Tuesday to cut oil production to shore up weak world prices
that have hit their economies hard, officials close to the talks
said. They said that oil ministers of the six-nation Gulf
Cooperation Council agreed to reduce production starting in March
and to ask other producers in the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries to join them in the cuts. The officials,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said the ministers also agreed
to ask Mexico, which is not an OPEC member, to join in cutting back
production. The leaders are trying to head off a growing economic
crisis. The Gulf countries, which together sit on half the world's
proven oil reserves and depend on exports for 75 percent of their
revenues, also are expected to discuss spending cuts and attracting
foreign investment. (GULF-OIL, GULF-SUMMIT)
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ After a landslide victory,
president-elect Hugo Chavez is vowing to crack down on tax evaders,
cut the number of ministries by two-thirds, restructure Venezuela's
foreign debt, eliminate corruption and call a referendum to rewrite
the constitution. But with Venezuela's oil-based economy running on
empty _ and a political establishment that sees Chavez as a villain
_ the former coup leader faces gargantuan obstacles. The victory
was a stunning blow to Venezuela's political and economic
establishment and a red warning flag for Latin America _ where the
gap between rich and poor is the widest in the world. Wealthy
Venezuelans, fearing that Chavez would impose a leftist
dictatorship, had begun sending assets out of the country even
before the vote. But reactions to Chavez's initial statements as
president-elect seemed hopeful. (VENEZUELA-CHAVEZ)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's hard currency reserves fell 8 percent
last month, drained by debt payments and efforts to prop up the
increasingly weak ruble, officials said Tuesday. The Central Bank's
reserves, which stood at dlrs 13.6 billion at the start of
November, shrank to dlrs 12.5 billion by the end of the month, the
Interfax news agency reported, quoting a bank announcement.
Reserves have dropped by nearly 30 percent since the start of the
year, the bank said. The Central Bank spent reserves trying to halt
the steady decline of the ruble, which is now at more than 20 to
the U.S. dollar. Before the economic crisis hit in August, the
ruble was trading at around 6 to the dollar. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's struggling economy showed isolated signs of
improvement in November but the overall outlook remains bleak, the
government said Tuesday. Domestic demand for household appliances
and mini-vehicles recovered slightly, and growth in Japan's
unemployment rate appeared to be easing, the Economic Planning
Agency said in its monthly report on the economy. Still, the
general state of the economy remained ``extremely severe,'' an
assessment that was unchanged from the previous month's report. The
agency said that deflationary pressures in the economy continued to
cut into corporate profits, forcing continued layoffs and cutbacks
in investment. One of the few strong areas _ export growth _ was
being threatened as protectionist pressures emerge in Europe and
the United States. (JAPAN-ECONOMY)

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Facing Republican House Judiciary Committee
members who won't change their minds, President Bill Clinton's
legal team is mounting a vigorous impeachment defense aimed at
undecided Republican lawmakers who will decide Clinton's fate. The
21 Republicans on the 37-member committee have made clear that,
barring any new evidence favorable to Clinton, they would vote for
at least one article of impeachment this week. The expert White
House witnesses will argue that Clinton did not commit impeachable
conduct by trying to hide a sexual affair; that impeachment for
such concealment would set a dangerous precedent for attacking
future presidents, and that the Lewinsky matter is far less grave
than President Richard Nixon's official abuse of power in
Watergate. (US-CLINTON-IMPEACHMENT)
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ At least nine U.N. vans went into the field
in Iraq on Tuesday, the day chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard
Butler said a series of surprise visits would begin. Caroline
Cross, the inspectors' spokeswoman in Baghdad, did not characterize
the inspections as ``surprise,'' describing them instead as ``their
usual hard work.'' U.N. officials in Baghdad have been reticent
since work resumed Nov. 18 after the latest crisis with Iraq. The
Baghdad regime in August and October halted the work of the U.N.
Special Commission, which oversees the inspections. UNSCOM must
certify that Iraq has eliminated its weapons of mass destruction
before punishing U.N. trade sanctions, imposed after Iraq's 1990
invasion of Kuwait, can be lifted. (UN-IRAQ)
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ New clashes erupted Tuesday in the West Bank as
domestic pressure mounted on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to
abandon the Wye River land-for-security agreement with the
Palestinians. The renewed violence and Israel's political turmoil
came just days before U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit to Israel
and the Palestinian areas next week. The trip was intended to shore
up the Wye agreement and restore calm to the region, but appeared
to be having the opposite effect. In the West Bank town of Ram just
north of Jerusalem, dozens of Palestinian students hurled stones at
Israeli soldiers who responded with tear gas and rubber bullets.
Four students were injured. Outside Netanyahu's office, dozens of
Jewish settlers staged a protest after assailants believed to be
Palestinian militants opened fire and wounded a West Bank settler
late Monday. (ISRAEL-PALESTINIAN)
	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ Chechen authorities found the decapitated
remains of four kidnapped foreigners Tuesday near a remote village
after a two-month search in the breakaway region in southern
Russia. An Associated Press reporter saw four severed heads near
the village of Assinovskaya, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) west of
Grozny, the Chechen capital. The heads were identified as those of
the four abducted foreigners by a bodyguard assigned to the four
when they were abducted Oct. 3 by unidentified gunmen in Grozny.
The hostages _ three Britons and a New Zealander _ were engineers.
They were working for Granger Telecom, a British telephone company,
installing 300,000 telephone lines across Chechnya.
(RUSSIA-YELTSIN)
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The first report on human rights
in Malaysia ever compiled by a local group was released Tuesday,
and it painted a dismal picture of political oppression and police
violence in the Southeast Asian nation. The 258-page report
described Malaysia as a ``severely restricted democracy'' where an
armory of laws provides for ``detention without trial and
restrictions over basic freedoms.'' The report by the country's
main human rights group, SUARAM or Voice of Malaysian Peoples,
comes at a time when world attention is focused on Malaysia because
of the highly politicized trial of former deputy prime minister
Anwar Ibrahim. (MALAYSIA-HUMAN RIGHTS)

Japan takes lead as former drug cheat returns
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Takahiro Mori wiped away a bitter
memory for Japan when he sped past former Chinese drug cheat Xiong
Guoming to claim the 400-meter medley gold medal at the Asian Games
Tuesday.
	   Xiong won four golds at the 1994 Asian Games as China gave Japan
a 25-5 battering in the gold count. He was one of seven Chinese
swim team members later banned for two years for testing positive
to steroids at the Hiroshima meet.
	   Xiong looked to be en route to a triumphant return, taking a
healthy lead halfway through the race. But Mori, 18, did the damage
over the first 50 meters of the final leg of freestyle to put Japan
ahead of China in the swimming gold standings.
	   Takashi Yamamoto gave Japan a fine start Tuesday, leading it to
a 4-3 lead in the gold medals after eight events.
	   Yamamoto, a 20-year-old from Osaka, clocked 53.34 seconds to win
the men's 100-meter butterfly. He went into the meet with the fifth
best time in the world this year with 52.88 in September and was
not troubled by his two Chinese rivals. Zhang Xiao took silver in
53.40 while South Korea's Han Kyu-Chul won bronze in 54.83.
	   China was also upstaged by Tsai Shu-min, who gave Taiwan its
first gold of the meet by winning the women's 200-meter freestyle.
	   Tsai, the top-ranked member of the field, having clocked the
seventh fastest time in the world this year, started slowly in lane
2 but turned up the tempo from the 100-meter mark.
	   She swept away from early leader Sachiko Yamada, who finished
third. China's Qin Caini improved down the stretch for silver.
	   Japan's hopes of revenge for 1994 received another boost Tuesday
with word that Chinese world champion Chen Yan is in doubt for the
rest of the meet after suffering diarrhea. She was badly beaten in
her favorite 400-meter medley Monday by Japan's Yasuko Tajima, and
didn't swim in Tuesday's freestyle heats.
	   ``As she is rather weak now, whether she will continue to
compete in the games is still in doubt, not to say winning gold,''
said coach Han Mingyan. The 200 medley is still to come.
	   The latest troubles at the pool included the posting of the
wrong diver as the winner of the women's 3-meter springboard.
	   Then, 30 minutes before the swim session, officials noticed the
pool was still set up for water polo. The hurried set-up let them
down as a plastic lane divider fell away from the wall after the
opening two events.
	   Two policemen jumped into the pool in full uniform, keeping the
noisy crowd entertained during a five-minute delay.

Jobless occupy unemployment offices in south, Paris suburb
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Groups of jobless occupied unemployment offices in
southern France and in one Parisian suburb Tuesday, keeping
pressure on the government to give them a year-end bonus of 3,000
francs (dlrs 535).
	   The jobless protest, which started in the southern port of
Marseille, has spread to Aix-en-Provence and Martigues, where
activists occupied a total of eight unemployment offices Tuesday
morning.
	   In addition, about 15 jobless were protesting in an unemployment
office in the Parisian suburb of Villejuif.
	   Meanwhile, police in Marseille evacuated two unemployment
offices Tuesday morning, moving about 300 protesters into the
streets.
	   Officials in the southern Bouches-du-Rhone region said Tuesday
they would decide ``before Christmas'' on a way to obtain financial
aid for the jobless. They were to hold a meeting later Tuesday.
	   The movement is similar to one that took place in France last
December, with unemployed workers demanding a bonus in order to be
able to celebrate the Christmas and New Year holidays.
	   Last year's protests prompted Socialist Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin's government to come up with a fund worth one billion francs
(dlrs 178 million) to help the needy.
	   Jobless activists say 15 billion francs is needed to help the
jobless this year.
	   Unemployment in France fell to 11.6 percent in October from 11.7
percent, reflecting a slow but steady improvement in France's high
jobless rate, long one of the nation's knottiest problems.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's hard currency reserves fell 8 percent
last month, drained by debt payments and efforts to prop up the
increasingly weak ruble, officials said Tuesday.
	   The Central Bank's reserves, which stood at dlrs 13.6 billion at
the start of November, shrank to dlrs 12.5 billion by the end of

U.S. dollar. Before the economic crisis hit in August, the ruble
was trading at around 6 to the dollar.
	   Since Russia's financial meltdown in August, the ruble has been
closely watched as a bellwether of economic confidence in the
country. Its steady dive has reflected fears that the government
will crank up the printing presses to pay domestic and foreign
debts _ a strategy almost certain to result in high inflation.
	   In other bad news, overall government revenues totaled 215.7
billion rubles (dlrs 10.8 billion) for the first 10 months of the
year, or 59 percent of target levels, the Finance Ministry said,
according to the Interfax news agency.
	   The government's chronic inability to meet tax collection and
revenue targets has been a serious stumbling block in its efforts
to reform the economy.
	   The International Monetary Fund and other lenders put together a
dlrs 22.6 billion bailout package last summer, but released only
around dlrs 5 billion before freezing further installments.
	   Lenders want the government to come up with a viable budget
before resuming the loans. The IMF has criticized the government's
economic blueprint as overly optimistic on revenues and heavy with
administrative controls over the economy.
	   After several delays, the Cabinet plans to pass the 1999 budget
on Thursday. In the past few years, the government and parliament
have failed to finalize the budget before the new year, further
complicating the process.
	   In other economic developments:
	   _ Russian crude oil production dropped 1 percent from January
through October, to 244.4 million metric tons, the State Statistics
Committee said Tuesday.
	   _ Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir Bulgak called on the European
Union on Monday to revoke anti-dumping measures against Russian
exports. The measures incur annual losses of some dlrs 300 million
to Russia, the Interfax news agency reported.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Solana, Cook quotes, Kosovo, Bosnia reviews &QL; 
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - NATO foreign ministers began the
process Tuesday of revising the 16-nation alliance's strategic
concept, the military and political principles that guide the NATO
mission.
	   The ministers are laying the groundwork for the 50th anniversary
NATO summit in Washington April 24-25, where leaders are expected
to approve the alliance's strategy for the 21st century and welcome
three new members, Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, into the
fold.
	   ``One of the special qualities of the alliance has always been
its ability to react flexibly to new situations,'' German Foreign
Minister Joschka Fischer told fellow ministers. ``On the eve of the
21st century we should ask ourselves if our instruments still match
the changed security environment.''
	   Today's threat is no longer a Russian tank assault across the
plains of Central Europe, but challenges from regional conflicts
like Bosnia and Kosovo, terrorism and the spread of weapons of mass
destruction. When these threats originate from outside NATO's
traditional territory of operations, the alliance must be prepared
to deal with them.
	   In practice, NATO has already adjusted to these new realities,
intervening in Bosnia, halting the humanitarian disaster in Kosovo
with the threat of air strikes, sending soldiers just across the
Kosovo border in Macedonia to rescue civilian cease-fire monitors
if needed.
	   ``NATO is already acting out of area, so let's not dramatize
that,'' said NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana.''
	   Added British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook: ``I think we have to
be pragmatic and grown up about this. That will require making a
judgment on a case by case basis.''
	   Cook stressed the increased role that the Europeans want to play
in continental security, particularly in cases where the United
States is less interested in participating. NATO is developing a
policy it calls the European Security and Defense Identity to deal
with that, but France and Britain are pressing for the European
Union to play a role too.
	   ``The focus must be strengthening and improving the European
security identity,'' Cook said, stressing nonetheless that ``NATO
will remain the basis for territorial defense for the EU.''
	   Solana said the EU, Europe's economic alliance, is changing and
NATO's plans must be adapted to the changes in the EU. ``We are
trying to reconcile these things.''
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, writing in the
British newspaper The Financial Times, said: ``NATO's primary
mission will always remain defense against aggression. But the
founders of the alliance also distinguished between what the treaty
commits us to do and what it permits us to do.''
	   She said Bosnia and Kosovo are recent examples ``that
demonstrate NATO must act when conflicts beyond its immediate
borders affect alliance interests. NATO must find the right balance
between the centrality of NATO's collective defense missions and
responding to such crises.''
	   NATO's central mission will always be collective defense and the
concept that an attack against one member is an aggression against
all. But attacks against members now take different forms and often
originate far away.
	   Albright planned to propose at the ministerial meeting here
setting up a Center for Weapons of Mass Destruction, essentially on
how to best share and use intelligence, officials said.
	   The plan would use NATO headquarters staff under one director,
with perhaps a few extra experts, they said.
	   The Germans plan to bring up the nuclear first-strike question
later in the meeting.
	   Fischer made waves when he called on NATO last month to consider
dropping its doctrine allowing a nuclear first-strike. This
doctrine, reaffirmed as recently as last year, has always been a
part of NATO's nuclear strategy and is considered an important
aspect of deterrence.
	   ``The minister will certainly raise the issue,'' a German
diplomatic source said. ``We have to see that in the context of
arms control, arms reduction and nonproliferation.''
	   The Germans don't have much backing on the issue, however.
	   The allies assessed the situation in Kosovo, where Serb security
forces and ethnic Albanian guerrillas clashed for seven months. The
threat of a NATO air strike stopped the fighting in October and the
cease-fire is generally holding, while American mediator
Christopher Hill attempts to firm the peace with political
agreement.
	   The ministers also made their six-monthly review of the
situation in Bosnia. No major reduction in the 32,000-troop level
in the NATO-led peacekeeping force is expected soon.

North Korea claims its satellite has orbited the earth 770 times
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ North Korea said Tuesday that an
artificial satellite which it claims was launched in August has
circled the earth 770 times since it was put into orbit.
	   ``The satellite moved along its normal orbit on set time each
day,'' the North's official Korean Central News Agency said.
	   North Korea fired a three-stage rocket on Aug. 31, which flew
over Japan and landed in the Pacific Ocean. The communist state
later said the launch put its first artificial satellite into
orbit.
	   U.S. officials first said the rocket was a three-stage ballistic
missile, but concluded later that North Korea had launched a very
small satellite that failed to achieve orbit.
	   Japanese officials say no evidence exists that a satellite was
launched and have criticized the firing as a blatant missile test.
	   North Korea has said the satellite was transmitting
revolutionary hymns praising the late President Kim Il Sung and his
heir and son, Kim Jong Il.
	   But U.S. and South Korean officials say they have failed to
detect any such transmissions or the satellite itself.

Toulouse escapes serious punishment
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ French club Toulouse escaped serious
punishment Tuesday following violent incidents at last month's
European Cup game at Welsh side Ebbw Vale.
	   The 1996 European champions were ordered to pay a maximum 2,600
pounds (dlrs 4,160) towards costs of their disciplinary hearing in
Dublin, while Toulouse's prop Franck Tournaire was ``severely
warned'' about his conduct.
	   A three-man European Rugby Cup disciplinary committee decided
that Tournaire had not made ``threatening contact'' with touch
judge Rob Dickson and decided that a reprimand, rather than any
ban, was appropriate.
	   Toulouse officials were reprimanded for not conducting
themselves in a proper fashion after the game, which Vale won
19-11.
	   Toulouse, which faces a tough European Cup quarter-final clash
against Ulster on Friday night, faced a misconduct complaint from
tournament director Roger Pickering.
	   Pickering asked that sanctions be imposed on Tournaire for
threatening behavior towards a touch judge, as well as other
Toulouse players and officials for their part in related incidents.
	   Toulouse president Rene Bouscatel subsequently apologized to
Ebbw Vale for the post-match events.
	   A policeman's helmet was knocked off as Toulouse players argued
with match officials after the final whistle, while police also
responded to an incident in the Vale clubhouse later that evening.
	   Violence marred the Pool C clash, culminating with Scottish
referee Ed Murray sending off Toulouse forward Cyrille Vancheri.
There were incidents outside the match commissioner's room before
and after Vancheri was hit by a 28-day ban.
	   ``The committee considered that the incidents at Ebbw Vale were
prejudicial to the tournament and to the game of rugby,'' the ERC
said in a statement.
	   ``The Toulouse officials, by their actions, did not conduct
themselves appropriately at all times. The committee cautioned the
Toulouse club and their officials, and warned them as to their
future conduct.
	   ``In the case of the complaint against Franck Tournaire, the
committee considered he had made unnecessary contact with the touch
judge.
	   ``The committee did not, however, consider this contact to be
threatening, but they emphasized strongly that no contact should
ever be made with a match official.
	   ``The committee severely warned Franck Tournaire as to his
future conduct in this regard.''
	   Toulouse is one of four French clubs in this season's
quarter-finals, along with Stade Francais, Colomiers and Perpignan.

Iran to help build pharmaceutical factory in Tajikistan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Iran has agreed to help build a pharmaceutical
factory in Tajikistan, a Russian news report said Tuesday.
	   The two countries signed a protocol of intention to build the
factory in the Tajik capital, Dushanbe, the ITAR-Tass news agency
said. The agreement was signed during a visit of Tajik Health
Minister Alamkhon Akhmedov to Iran.
	   Tajik officials estimated the cost of the joint project at dlrs
10 million. Construction is expected to take 18 months.
	   A final agreement on the deal is to be signed during a visit of
Tajik President Emomali Rakhmonov to Iran next week, the report
said.

<TEXT>
	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ Chechen authorities found the decapitated
remains of four kidnapped foreigners Tuesday near a remote village
after a two-month search in the breakaway region in southern
Russia.
	   An Associated Press reporter saw four severed heads near the
village of Assinovskaya, about 40 kms (25 miles) west of Grozny,
the Chechen capital. He did not see any sign of the bodies.
	   The heads were identified as those of the four abducted
foreigners by Umar Makhauri, who had been a bodyguard assigned to
the four when they were abducted Oct. 3 by unidentified gunmen in
Grozny. He said the bodies had not been found.
	   But Chechen government officials at the scene said four bodies
had been found without giving further details. Chechen President
Aslan Maskhadov said in Grozny that the bodies of four men had been
recovered.
	   The hostages _ Britons Peter Kennedy, Darren Hickey, and Rudolf
Petschi, and New Zealand's Stanley Shaw _ were engineers. They were
working for Granger Telecom, a British telephone company,
installing 300,000 telephone lines across Chechnya.
	   Spokesmen at the British and New Zealand embassies in Moscow
said they were checking on reports the four men had been killed,
but could not comment. The British Foreign Ministry in London said
it was investigating urgently reports that bodies had been found.
	   A spokesman for Granger Telecom in Britain said, ``We have heard
the reports and are obviously investigating, but there is nothing
we can say at this stage.''
	   Chechen acting Firt Vice Premier Turpal Atgeriyev, who is
heading the investigation into the killings, said authorities had
several suspects in the abduction, but have failed to make any
progress, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Eamon Hickey, the father of one of the missing men, said he
heard the news and was hoping it would not be confirmed.
	   ``There is so much rumor and counter-rumor coming from out there
that we don't know what to think. Obviously we are hoping and
praying that it does not turn out to be true,'' he said at his home
in England.
	   Chechen authorities had been searching for the missing men for
the past two months. British officials said they had not received
any ransom demand for the missing men.
	   Maskhadov said the deaths of the four men were a major blow to
Chechnya and its efforts to gain international recognition of its
independence. He blamed the rash of abductions in Chechnya to
unidentified ``outside forces'' and their Chechen henchmen.
	   ``I am ready to answer before my people and the whole world for
what happened,'' he was quoted as saying by the Interfax news
agency.
	   Hostage-takings, usually for ransom, have become common in
Chechnya since the end of the breakaway republic's two-year war for
independence from Russia in 1996. But victims are rarely killed.
	   Since the beginning of 1998, 176 people have been kidnapped in
the North Caucasus region of Russia, including dozens of
foreigners, and 90 of them released, officials have said.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Tourists were turned away from the
Acropolis and other sites Tuesday as employees of Greece's culture
ministry began a 48-hour strike.
	   Skeleton staff will remain on duty to safeguard archaeological
sites and museums _ which will remain closed until Thursday.
	   Ministry employees are protesting the merger of their social
security and pension fund with other plans. They fear the merger
could reduce the size of their pensions.
	   The pension consolidation is part of government efforts to
streamline state spending and seek entry in the European Union's

U.S. envoy urges Australia to accept nuclear waste dump
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS; UPDATES 5th-6th grafs with Australia denying it will
accept foreign nuclear waste.

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ The United States has urged Australia
to accept a proposal by an American company to establish a dump for
the world's nuclear waste, an idea promoted Tuesday by U.S.
President Bill Clinton's special envoy on weapons of mass
destruction, Robert Gallucci.
	   Speaking on Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio, Gallucci said
the proposal would not only be profitable for Australia but would
also be a service to the international community.
	   	   ``Australia could play a role in that, I think it would make a
tremendous contribution to international security,'' he said.
	   ``I can't help but think that the economics would be very
favorable for a commercial arrangement that involved addressing the
needs of so many countries who do not have the geology for the long
term storage of spent nuclear fuel or radioactive waste,'' he said.
	   But a spokeswoman for Australia's Industry and Resources
Minister, Nick Minchin, said Australia had no plans to become an
international nuclear waste dump.
	   ``Government policy is not to accept waste from other countries
and there is no intention to change that,'' the spokeswoman said,
speaking on the condition of anonymity.
	   A Seattle-based company, Pangea, has been quietly promoting the
concept for two years. It was forced to go public with its plans
last week when environmental groups uncovered a promotional video
extolling Australia's qualities as a dump site.

Opening of Israelis' spy trial in Cyprus postponed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LARNACA, Cyprus (AP) _ The opening of the trial of two Israelis
accused of spying on Cyprus was postponed Tuesday at the request of
defense attorneys.
	   Defense lawyer Antis Triantafyllides asked for the delay, saying
he needed time to study a rephrasing of the espionage charges.
	   The case, which has strained relations between Cyprus and
Israel, involves two Israeli citizens, Udi Hargov, 37, and Igal
Damary, 49.
	   The judge set a new trial date of Dec. 21 and ordered that the
suspects remain in custody.
	   The government alleged that between Oct. 15 and Nov. 6, they
conspired to spy on Cyprus, conducted spying operations and
possessed radio frequency scanners without a government license.
	   The revised charges say the men conspired to spy against Cyprus
``in Israel and Cyprus.''
	   The two were arrested on Nov. 6 in the small fishing village of
Zigi, near a Cypriot army base and training area.

to trim &QL; 
 &UR; With UNICEF-FactBox &QL; 
 &UR; By EMMA ROSS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Hundreds of millions of children are growing up
unequipped to build decent lives because they are denied quality
basic education _ caught in a crisis that endangers world peace,
the United Nations children's agency said Tuesday.
	   Forty percent of elementary school-aged children in developing
countries either never enter school or drop out before they learn
to read, write and count, UNICEF's executive director Carol Bellamy
said in a new report.
	   In many industrialized countries, 15-20 percent of children
leave school without the skills necessary for finding and keeping a
job.
	   Nearly a sixth of humanity _ almost a billion people, will enter
the 21st century unable to read a book or sign their names, much
less operate a computer or understand a simple application form.
And two-thirds of them will be women, the report said.
	   At a news conference, Bellamy said the 21st century will be seen
as a race between education and catastrophe.
	   ``It's a situation that many would call tragic, but it is more
than tragic. It is just wrong, and quite dangerous,'' she said.
``It's fair to say that basic education has the power to save lives
as well as any vaccine.''
	   ``The consequences of illiteracy are profound _ and even
potentially life-threatening,'' Bellamy said. ``For millions and
millions of children, education is literally a matter of life and
death.''
	   Citing findings gathered from throughout the developing world,
UNICEF said there is a direct correlation between years of
schooling and the death rates of infants and mothers in childbirth.
	   Children who grow up without basic education find it harder to
support themselves and their families. Education helps people learn
how to achieve fundamental human rights, such as health, nutrition
and safe motherhood, but it also helps adults and children learn to
respect diversity in society and to work with others, the report
said.
	   ``On a society-wide scale, the denial of education harms the
cause of democracy and social progress and, by extension,
international peace and security,'' the report said.
	   Many countries still lack the political will to make education a
priority, Bellamy said.
	   Asia and Latin America in particular have seen significant
improvements over the last decade, but vast disparities between the
haves and have-nots still exist there, Bellamy said.
	   Highlighting schools and countries that have found ways to reach
more children, the report said in the Philippines itinerant
teachers with backpacks take school to children in the most rugged
provinces. In Cambodia, teachers from different villages share
materials, and school by radio is used in the Dominican Republic,
Nepal and Nicaragua.
	   UNICEF said it would cost about dlrs 7 billion a year over the
next 10 years for national governments to give all children access
to quality education.
	   ``This is less than is annually spent on cosmetics in the United
States or on ice cream in Europe,'' Bellamy said.

Poland rejects missile deal with Israel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Poland on Tuesday rejected a previous deal
to arm its Huzar helicopter with Israeli-made missile, Prime
Minister Jerzy Buzek announced.
	   Buzek made the announcement after a weekly Cabinet meeting.
	   Following years of negotiating with several potential partners,
Poland last year awarded the dlrs 800 million contract to Israel's
Rafael and Elbit Systems Ltd. to equip the Huzar helicopters in
line with NATO requirements.
	   Poland, which plans to join NATO in April, selected the Israeli
companies over the U.S. company Boeing.
	   Under the deal, which required approval from both governments,
Rafael was to supply the Huzar with anti-tank NTD missiles and
Elbit was to provide electronic integrating systems.
	   But Poland's Solidarity-led government, which took office
shortly after the agreement was signed, criticized the handling of
the tenders by its ex-communist predecessors and demanded missile
tests. It also decided to seek another tender for the integrating
systems, but has set no date for it.
	   Last week the defense ministry said that Israel failed to offer
the missiles for tests in Polish weather and terrain conditions by
November, as was earlier agreed.

Police arrest three men for murder of teen-ager
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Police have arrested three men for the
stabbing death of an Egyptian teen-ager, who apparently was killed
because she struggled with the would-be rapists, police said
Tuesday.
	   Police said the men allegedly forced 17-year-old Shaymaa
Mohammed Hassan into their car Sunday in Giza province, then drove
her to an isolated area near the Great Pyramids where they tried to
rape her.
	   When she fought them, the men slit her throat and then took
turns stabbing her 43 times, the police said.
	   Police located the suspects on Monday because of a description
that the young woman had given her father of a man who had heckled
her on Saturday.
	   The man, who was among those arrested, was an unemployed
carpenter who lived in Hassan's neighborhood, police said.
	   The men face charges of murder and kidnapping with the intent to
rape, both punishable by death.

South Korea beats Japan 29-14 in Rugby Seven final
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS that Sung missed conversion, 6th graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ After dropping behind 14-0, South Korea
scored 29 unanswered points to beat Japan 29-14 Tuesday for the
gold medal of seven-man rugby at the Asian Games.
	   Japan took the lead almost immediately when Tsutomu Matsuda ran
almost the length of the field to score a try. Keisuke Sawaki made
the conversion.
	   Three minutes later, Sawaki scored a try himself and added the
conversion, making it 14-0 for Japan.
	   South Korea started its comeback two minutes later. Yoo Min-suk
did a superb fake at midfield and took it in for a try. The
conversion by Sung Hae-Kung made it 14-7.
	   South Korea tied the match a minute later when Kim Hyung-ki made
a try at the end of the half and Sung converted.
	   In the second half, South Korea kept the pressure on and scored
with a relentless attack at the goal line. Kang Dong-ho carried the
ball in for a try but Sung missed the conversion.
	   Sung scored four minutes later, breaking out of a pack, and
converted, bringing the score to 26-14.
	   Sung capped his performance in the the final minute with a
drop-kick worth three points.
	   Thailand beat Taiwan 19-5 for the bronze medal, and Hong Kong
defeated Kazakstan 14-12 for fifth place.
	   In the semifinals, South Korea yielded an early try to Thailand,
but pulled ahead 7-5 by halftime and won 28-10.
	   Japan scored two converted first-half tries for a 14-0 shutout
of Taiwan.

<SLUG> Film on Solzhenitsyn canceled after family protests </SLUG>


<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Broadcast of a documentary marking the 80th
birthday of writer Alexander Solzhenitsyn was canceled because his
family complained it contained unauthorized footage, a newspaper
reported Tuesday.
	   Russia's RTR television station had planned to broadcast the
film, called ``The Chosen One'' last Friday, on the 25th
anniversary of the publication of Solzhenitsyn's renowned work,
``The Gulag Archipelago.''
	   But less than two hours before its scheduled broadcast, the
station announced on its evening news that it had canceled the
showing.
	   RTR spokesman Andrei Fatyushchenko said the station decided to
honor the wishes of Solzhenitsyn's wife, Natalya, who had sent a
letter to RTR chief Mikhail Shvydkoi to protest, the daily Moscow
Times reported Tuesday.
	   The footage of the family's private life, made by a filmmaker
who had stayed at the Solzhenitsyns' house, was filmed on condition
it would not be broadcast, Mrs. Solzhenitsyn said in the letter,
which was published by the daily Kommersant.
	   The filmmaker, Olesia Fokina, had promised the footage would
only be used for ``future archives,'' Mrs. Solzhenitsyn said.
	   Shvydkoi, the RTR chief, said the film would not be aired ``at
least until both sides come to an agreement, if it is at all
possible,'' the Moscow Times reported.
	   Russia's other two main television stations have also prepared
documentaries to mark Solzhenitsyn's birthday on Dec. 11.
	   The ORT television station showed the first part of its
documentary, ``The Knot,'' on Friday. NTV will show its film, ``The
Life of Solzhenitsyn,'' this week.
	   Solzhenitsyn's books ``One Day in the Life of Ivan
Denisovitch,'' ``The Gulag Archipelago'' and ``Cancer Ward'' laid
bare the cruelties and repressions of the Soviet system.
	   ``The Gulag Archipelago'' was first published in Paris in 1973,
and Solzhenitsyn was arrested and expelled from the Soviet Union
the following year. He lived in Vermont for 18 years, then returned
to Russia in 1994.
	   He enjoyed much more influence as a dissident than he does
today. He is fiercely critical of post-Soviet Russia, but many
Russians find his proposed solutions to be overly conservative,
nationalistic or irrelevant.
	   Solzhenitsyn won the Nobel prize for literature in 1970.

Yeltsin fires key aides during a brief break from hospital
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to ADD comment by presidential spokesman,
Communist Party leader. Trims. No pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; With PM-Russia-Failing Yeltsin, Bjt &QL; 
 &UR; By NICK WADHAMS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin, still recovering from pneumonia,
walked around his hospital grounds today but showed little signs of
any new surprise forays to the Kremlin.
	   The ailing president roused himself from his sickbed for three
hours Monday and fired a number of top aides. The dismissed aides
included some who have commented recently on Yeltsin's weakened
health.
	   ``The president wanted to show who's the boss,'' said Alexander
Shokhin, leader of the pro-government party in parliament. ``He's
like a lion who licked his wounds and now roared at those who
thought he was already out of the game.''
	   Yeltsin spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said doctors allowed the
president to take brief walks on the hospital grounds today for the
first time since he was hospitalized with pneumonia on Nov. 22.
	   ``That means he is on the way to recovery,'' Yakushkin was
quoted as saying by the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Yakushkin said Yeltsin was working on documents, but had no
meetings planned and would remain hospitalized as long as necessary
to recuperate.
	   Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov said Yeltsin's actions
Monday made no real difference for the running of the country.
	   ``He is not governing anything any longer,'' Zyuganov said of
Yeltsin. ``This is simply an agony.''
	   Shown on television Monday evening, Yeltsin _ who rarely seems
so robust as when he is firing someone _ appeared energized as he
scowled and delivered one of his patented tirades.
	   ``Tough discipline, order and reform is what we need,'' Yeltsin
said slowly and sternly as he glared at his staff from the head of
a long table. Aides looked down and busied themselves scribbling
notes.
	   ``You can see how vigorous I am,'' Yeltsin said, according to
Yakushkin.
	   Among those sacked was presidential chief of staff Valentin
Yumashev. A former journalist who ghostwrote Yeltsin's memoirs,
Yumashev had served as chief of staff for nearly two years _ an
eternity in Yeltsin's Kremlin.
	   Gen. Nikolai Bordyuzha, 49, the secretary of the presidential
security council, was appointed the new chief of staff. He
immediately called for tackling corruption.
	   ``Fighting corruption is very important today, including in the
upper echelons of power,'' he told Russia's NTV television.
	   Yakushkin said Yeltsin dismissed the aides because of their
failure to stem crime or respond to several incidents of political
extremism, including anti-Semitic remarks by a Communist parliament
deputy.
	   But the ousters were thought to reflect Yeltsin's unhappiness
over the aides' candid remarks about the president's health.
Yumashev and others have openly said Yeltsin's ailments left him
too weak to handle day-to-day affairs.
	   ``In a situation when the presidential inner circle starts
speaking about the boss as if he were a political outsider, you
have to replace either the president or his aides,'' the business
daily Kommersant said today. ``Yeltsin has chosen the second.''
	   Yeltsin has little since the economy went into a tailspin in
August, leaving Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov to tackle the
crisis. But the president insists he will carry out his term until
it ends in 2000.

 &UR; Severed heads of Chechen hostages found &LR; 
	   ACHKHOI-MARTAN, Russia (Reuters) _ The severed heads of three
Britons and a New Zealander kidnapped by Chechen gunmen were
discovered today left by the side of a road.
	   The heads were discovered on a highway in the lawless breakaway
province near the border with a neighbouring region. The rest of
the bodies have not been found.
	   Chechen officials said a man who had worked as a bodyguard for
the hostages before they were captured had identified them.
	   Russian police in Moscow confirmed the killings but gave no
further details.
	   The four men _ Britons Darren Hickey, Rudolf Petschi and Peter
Kennedy and New Zealander Stanley Shaw _ were grabbed by
unidentified gunmen Oct. 3 in the Chechen capital Grozny. They were
working for Granger Telecom, a British telephone company,
installing 300,000 telephone lines across Chechnya.
	   They had been living in an armed complex as guests of the
separatist Chechen government.
	   Russian news agencies quoted Chechnya's president, Aslan
Maskhadov, as saying in Grozny he was saddened and angered by the
news, and would send messages of condolences to the British and New
Zealand governments.
	   In statements reported by Itar-Tass news agency, he blamed
``foreign special forces'' and their Chechen agents for carrying
out the murders. He said the aim of the killings was to provoke
more violence and hinder his attempts to build relations abroad.
	   Turpal Atgeriyev, acting first deputy premier in Maskhadov's
government, told Tass that Chechen officials already believe they
know who was responsible.
	   Initial reports said Maskhadov had referred to only three
victims, but those reports were later revised to say there were
four. A Chechen official told Tass there may have been some
difficulties in identifying the head thought to be that of New
Zealander Shaw.
	   Chechnya has suffered from poverty and lawlessness since
fighting a 21-month war of independence from Russia that ended when
Moscow withdrew its troops in 1996.
	   Maskhadov, seen in Moscow as a relative moderate, is opposed by
renegade warlords who say they want to set up a more strict Islamic
state and maintain a firmer stance toward Russia.
	   The region is not recognized as independent by any country, but
Moscow no longer exercises any authority there.
	   Russian officials say more than 100 people are currently being
held by Chechen gunmen. Most of the hostages are Russian
servicemen, although more than a dozen foreigners have been held at
various times.
	   Two British aid workers were freed Sept. 20 after more than 15
months in captivity and said they had been abused by their captors.
Shortly after the war ended, six Red Cross hospital workers were
killed by gunmen in an overnight attack.
	   Russian President Boris Yeltsin's personal representative to the
region, Valentin Vlasov, was also freed last month after being held
for nearly half a year.

Spacewalking electricians to wire together first two station parts

	   SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) _ Two spacewalking astronauts faced
the hardest and most important job of their careers Monday: hooking
up 40 electrical connections between the first two pieces of the
international space station.
	   The work called for Jerry Ross, NASA's most experienced
spacewalker, and James Newman to clamp together the connectors for
power and data flow. The spacewalk, the first of three scheduled
for this week, was expected to last 6{ hours.
	   On Sunday, Endeavour's crew used the shuttle's robot arm and
thruster rockets to snap together the Russian-made piece, Zarya,
and the American-built component, Unity, forming a seven-story,
35-ton tower in Endeavour's cargo bay.
	   Construction of the space station hinges on making the hookups,
warned NASA's lead flight director, Bob Castle. Unity, a connecting
passageway, needs the solar power generated by the Zarya control
module to survive.
	   Working 240 miles above Earth, Ross and Newman had 135 tools at
their disposal and a horde of engineers standing by in two
countries to offer advice.
	   Once all the connectors were joined, flight controllers planned
to turn on the power inside the fledgling station.
	   Newman had the more unwieldy job, Ross the more hand-intensive.
	   The plan called for Newman to unclamp each jumper cable and hand
it to Ross to link to its mate on the other side. With each
electrical connector attached to 20- to 30-foot cables, it was
going to be like handling ``an octopus and depending upon how cold
those cables are going to be it could be a relatively stiff
octopus,'' Ross predicted before the flight.
	   Before locking the connectors together, Ross had to inspect each
end to make sure the tiny pins inside were not bent or caked with
debris.
	   Each man's spacesuit was equipped with a mini jetpack in case
their safety lines to the shuttle broke. Endeavour is so loaded
that it would be difficult for it to dash after a runaway
spacewalker.
	   NASA deliberately picked two pros for the job and, even then,
had both men go through 200 hours of training underwater, the
closest approximation to weightlessness on Earth.
	   Ross, 50, a husky Air Force colonel, has made four previous
spacewalks, not to mention real construction experience. He worked
in a steel mill and did highway construction work back in his
college days.
	   The taller, thinner Newman, a 42-year-old physicist, conducted a
station-practice spacewalk in 1993.

Top Bosnian Serb in custody pleads innocent to genocide charges

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ A Bosnian Serb general accused of
masterminding the 1995 massacre of thousands of Muslim civilians
pleaded innocent Monday to genocide and crimes against humanity.
	   Gen. Radislav Krstic, the top Bosnian Serb war crimes suspect in
U.N. custody, commanded Bosnian Serb troops who carried out the
killings in the U.N.-protected ``safe haven'' of Srebrenica in
eastern Bosnia.
	   Krstic listened quietly Monday as his 13-page indictment was
read at the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal, then calmly responded ``I
plead not guilty.''
	   He faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment if convicted of
any of six charges for alleged genocide, extermination, murder and
persecution. A trial date has not been set.
	   Krstic, who wore a green suit, white shirt and tie, was allowed
to remain seated as he entered his pleas. His lawyer, Belgrade
attorney Nenad Petrusic, told presiding Judge Claude Jorda of
France that Krstic was suffering from serious injuries that made it
difficult for him to stand up. Krstic lost part of his right leg,
reportedly after stepping on a mine in 1994.
	   Petrusic described Krstic's health as ``truly, seriously
imperiled,'' and said there was a chance of gangrene where the limb
was amputated.
	   Asked by Jorda how he felt, Krstic said: ``As well as can be
expected on the whole, but I am tired after the arrest.
Exhausted.'' Krstic also complained that there was no heat in his
U.N. cell and that he was receiving no therapy for his injured leg.
	   Still, he said he had been treated well since his arrest last
Wednesday in northern Bosnia by U.S. troops serving in the NATO-led
Stabilization Force.
	   Krstic, reportedly a close associate of former Bosnian Serb
leader Radovan Karadzic and his wartime military leader, Gen. Ratko
Mladic, is accused of helping to plan and carry out the July 1995
massacre of thousands of Muslims in Srebrenica.
	   Karadzic and Mladic also face genocide charges alleging that
they masterminded the slaughter, but neither is in custody.
	   According to the indictment, forces under Krstic and Mladic
``either expelled or killed'' almost every Bosnian Muslim in the
enclave using automatic weapons, hand grenades and other weaponry.
	   In Karadzic's and Mladic's indictments, prosecutors estimate
that about 6,000 Muslims, mostly civilians, were killed at
Srebrenica _ making it Europe's worst civilian massacre since the
Holocaust.
	   Krstic's indictment, issued in October and publicized only after
his arrest, describes the killings as ``wide-scale and organized.''
The indictment had been kept secret to prevent Krstic from going
into hiding.
	   Prosecutors say Muslims were assembled at locations including a
warehouse and schools before being summarily executed then hastily
buried in mass graves. Krstic's troops later dug up the bodies and
reburied them elsewhere when the international community learned of
the killings, prosecutors allege.
	   The tribunal was established in 1993 by the U.N. Security
Council to prosecute genocide and war crimes stemming from the
armed clashes that marked the breakup of the former Yugoslavia.

Helicopter rescues TV crew trapped on Arctic island
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ While snow squalls whipped across the desolate
Arctic landscape, a Russian helicopter emerged from the dusky
winter light Dec. 1 and rescued a TV crew stranded seven weeks on a
remote island by bad weather.
	   The three-person crew _ a Russian, a Japanese and an Australian
who had been making a documentary on polar bears _ had three days
of food left when the helicopter airlifted them from Wrangel Island
to the port of Pevek, the Ministry of Emergency Situations said.
	   They had waited for weeks for the skies to clear up enough so
that a helicopter could land. The temperature on Wrangel Island has
been around minus 22 degrees, and the Arctic days never get
brighter than twilight.
	   Nikita Ovsyannikov said he, Tatsuhiko Kobayashi and cameraman
John McGuiness had been stranded since they completed their work on
Oct. 15.
	   The three holed up in a cabin on the island's northeast coast,
about 350 miles west of Alaska.
	   Kobayashi developed complications from a recent eye operation,
but the others were reported in good health.
	   The filmmakers were working for Natural History Pty. Ltd., in
New Zealand.

 &UR; Norwegian journalist killed in road accident in Iraq
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A car carrying a Norwegian television team
ran off the road and overturned Dec. 2, killing one journalist and
injuring another.
	   Norway's TV2 said two of its staff members were in the accident
on the desert road near the Iraq-Jordan border. Cameraman Knut
Andre Danielsen was killed and reporter Anders Saether injured.
	   The driver, a Jordanian, also was injured.
	   Saether and Danielsen's body were brought back to Baghdad, said
Aram Semerjian, the Norwegian consul-general.
	   The journalists had planned to stay in Iraq for about four days
working on a feature film.

 &UR; Former Dominican air force officer arrested in journalist's
slaying
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ U.S. authorities have
arrested a man wanted in the death of a journalist in 1975, during
the tenure of former President Joaquin Balaguer.
	   The arrest of former air force officer Mariano Duran Cabrera in
New York was confirmed Nov. 30 by Dominican authorities.
	   Duran, who owns a liquor store in the Bronx, is charged with
firing the shot that killed Orlando Martinez. He was arrested Nov.
28 on a federal extradition warrant.
	   Duran joined the air force in 1966 and was a member of its
special services squad. He left the military in 1983 and emigrated
to the United States.
	   Martinez was director of the magazine Ahora and a writer for the
El Nacional newspaper. He was critical of Balaguer's rule, which
was marked by rigged elections, human rights abuses and political
killings.

 &UR; Peru court orders arrest of former TV station owner and family
	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ A Peruvian court has ordered the arrest of a
former television station owner who aired reports linking the
military to human rights abuses.
	   The court issued a warrant Dec. 4 for Israeli-born businessman
Baruch Ivcher, charging that he doctored the station's ownership
registry. Warrants also were issued for his wife and daughter.
	   The family lives in the United States, where Ivcher fled last
year saying he feared for his life.
	   Ivcher's lawyer, Armando Lengua, said the warrants were part of
a government-orchestrated campaign against Ivcher, whose station
broadcast reports linking Peru's military and National Intelligence
Service to human rights abuses, corruption and torture.
	   A government-controlled court revoked Ivcher's Peruvian
citizenship in 1997, saying he never renounced his Israeli
citizenship. Because Peruvian law does not allow foreigners to own
broadcast stations, another court stripped Ivcher of his
controlling interest in Channel 2.
	   Control was given to minority shareholders Samuel and Mendel
Winter. Since the Winters took control, Channel 2 has stopped
reporting military corruption and abuses.
	   The government has said the issue is a legal dispute between
shareholders.

 &UR; South Africa's first free, private station in trouble
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ South Africa's first free,
private television station is facing possible shutdown after two
months of broadcasts.
	   The Independent Broadcasting Authority took the first step Dec.
1 toward closing down e.tv over its failure to meet a deadline to
begin broadcasting news, according to The Star newspaper.
	   The channel, a joint venture of black-run consortiums and
Time-Warner Inc., was supposed to have begun broadcasting news Nov.
30.
	   Instead, acting news and current affairs director Rapitse
Monthsho was suspended Dec. 1 by the station. A letter signed by
Jonathan Proctor, head of Midi TV, which runs e.tv, accused Monthso
of abusiveness and poor performance, The Star reported.
	   Monthsho would not comment. E.tv spokesman San Reddy confimed
Monthsho was suspended but would not say if it was permanent.
	   The broadcasting authority found seven violations of e.tv's
license during the channel's first week of operation, from Oct.
1-7.
	   Among the violations:
	   _ No shows in four of the country's 11 official languages. The
license requirement called for one hour a week.
	   _ It only broadcast 30 minutes in children's programming instead
of three hours, 37 minutes per week.
	   _Too many ads per hour.
	   Allowed to broadcast for only six hours a day at first, e.tv's
lineup includes reruns from the Warner TV library, Magic Johnson's
talk show ``The Magic Hour,'' cop-and-lawyer shows like ``Silk
Stalkings'' and local shows on sports, current events and culture.

NATO foreign ministers to forge new strategic concept
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ With the lessons of Bosnia and Kosovo
as a backdrop, NATO begins forging a new strategic concept Tuesday,
moving beyond the traditional tasks of collective defense to focus
on weapons of mass destruction, terrorism and regional conflicts.
	   NATO foreign minsters will meet to update the strategic concept,
which lays out the alliance's mission, to reflect what NATO already
has been doing in practice since the fall of the Berlin wall a
decade ago. The concept was last revised in 1991.
	   ``NATO's primary mission will always remain defense against
aggression,'' Secretary of State Madeleine Albright wrote Monday in
Britain's Financial Times. ``But the founders of the alliance also
distinguished between what the treaty commits us to do and what it
permits us to do.''
	   Today's threat is not a Russian tank assault across the plains
of central Europe, but regional and ethnic violence like in Bosnia
and Kosovo, terrorism and the spread of weapons of mass
destruction. When these threats originate from outside NATO's
traditional territory of operations, the alliance must be prepared
to deal with them.
	   ``The challenge is to bring the strategy into line with the
changing reality,'' said a senior NATO diplomat briefing reporters
before the foreign ministers' meeting here Tuesday and Wednesday.
	   The ministers will draw up the concept for approval at the NATO
summit on April 24-25. That summit, marking the alliance's 50th
anniversary, will also welcome three new members, Poland, Hungary
and the Czech Republic.
	   Albright will table a proposal at the ministerial meeting here
to set up a Center for Weapons of Mass Destruction, essentially an
intelligence-sharing center, officials said.
	   Germany, meanwhile, is expected to bring up the nuclear
first-strike question.
	   German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer made waves when he
called on NATO last month to consider dropping its doctrine
allowing a nuclear first-strike. This doctrine, reaffirmed as
recently as last year, has always been a part of NATO's nuclear
strategy and is considered an important aspect of deterrence.
	   ``The minister will certainly raise the issue,'' a German
diplomatic source said. ``We have to see that in the context of
arms control, arms reduction and nonproliferation.''
	   The Germans don't have much backing on the issue and no one at
NATO sees it as more than a speed bump on the road to the new
strategic concept.
	   The allies will assess the situation in Kosovo, the south
Serbian province where Serb security forces and ethnic Albanian
guerrillas clashed for seven months. The threat of NATO air strikes
stopped the fighting in October and the cease-fire is generally
holding, despite sporadic outbursts.
	   The ministers also will make a regular six-month review of the
situation in Bosnia. While there may be some cosmetic changes in
the 32,000-member NATO-led force in Bosnia, no major reduction in
the troop level is seen any time soon.
	   ``Bosnia and Kosovo are recent examples that demonstrate NATO
must act when conflicts beyond its immediate borders affect
alliance interests,'' Albright wrote in her Financial Times
article. ``NATO must find the right balance between the centrality
of NATO's collective defense missions and responding to such
crises.''

	   SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) _ Two astronauts floated out into the
vacuum of space Monday to hook up 40 electrical connections between
the first two pieces of the international space station.
	   It was the hardest and most important job of their careers.
	   The work called for Jerry Ross, NASA's most experienced
spacewalker, and James Newman to clamp together the connectors for
power and data flow. The spacewalk, the first of three scheduled
for this week, was expected to last 6{ hours.
	   On Sunday, Endeavour's crew used the shuttle's robot arm and
thruster rockets to snap together the Russian-made piece, Zarya,
and the American-built component, Unity, forming a seven-story,
35-ton tower in Endeavour's cargo bay.
	   Construction of the space station hinges on making the hookups,
warned NASA's lead flight director, Bob Castle. Unity, a connecting
passageway, needs the solar power generated by the Zarya control
module to survive.
	   Working 240 miles above Earth, Ross and Newman had 135 tools at
their disposal and a horde of engineers standing by in two
countries to offer advice.
	   Once all the connectors were joined, flight controllers planned
to turn on the power inside the fledgling station.
	   Newman had the more unwieldy job, Ross the more hand-intensive.
	   The plan called for Newman to unclamp each power cable and hand
it to Ross to link to its mate on the other side. With each
electrical connector attached to 20- to 30-foot cables, it was
going to be like handling ``an octopus and depending upon how cold
those cables are going to be it could be a relatively stiff
octopus,'' Ross predicted before the flight.
	   Before locking the connectors together, Ross had to inspect each
end to make sure the tiny pins inside were not bent or caked with
debris.
	   Each man's spacesuit was equipped with a mini jetpack in case
their safety lines to the shuttle broke. Endeavour is so loaded
that it would be difficult for it to dash after a runaway
spacewalker.
	   NASA deliberately picked two pros for the job and, even then,
had both men go through 200 hours of training underwater, the
closest approximation to weightlessness on Earth.
	   Ross, 50, a husky Air Force colonel, has made four previous
spacewalks and also has real construction experience. He worked in
a steel mill and did highway construction work back in his college
days.
	   The taller, thinner Newman, a 42-year-old physicist, conducted a
station-practice spacewalk in 1993.

	   SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) _ Two spacewalking astronauts hooked
up electrical connections between the first two pieces of the
international space station on Monday, a laborious yet crucial
construction job.
	   Jerry Ross, NASA's most experienced spacewalker, snapped the
connectors together as James Newman handed him the attached cables.
They were mightily impressed with the seven-story station towering
above them.
	   ``This is sure a beautiful piece of hardware,'' Newman said.
	   Ross worked steadily from the end of Endeavour's 50-foot robot
arm, starting at the bottom with the American-made Unity module. He
attached jumper cables there before being hoisted more than 40 feet
to the Russian-built Zarya stacked on top.
	   ``Jerry, How's the view?'' Newman called out from below.
	   ``Fantastic if I had time to look,'' Ross replied.
	   The work called for Ross and Newman to clamp together 40
connectors for power and data flow; two hours into the spacewalk,
they got the first set attached. ``OK, 610 going to 608,'' Ross
reported. Each connector was numbered so there would be no mistake.
	   ``Looking good, man,'' Ross said to Newman, ``keep it coming.''
	   The spacewalk, the first of three scheduled for this week, was
expected to last 6{ hours.
	   On Sunday, Endeavour's crew used the robot arm and thruster
rockets to snap together Zarya and Unity, forming a 77-foot, 35-ton
tower in Endeavour's cargo bay.
	   Construction of the space station hinged on making the
electrical hookups, said NASA's lead flight director, Bob Castle.
Unity, a connecting passageway, needs the solar power generated by
the Zarya control module to survive.
	   Working 240 miles above Earth, Ross and Newman had 135 tools at
their disposal and a horde of engineers standing by in two
countries to offer advice. They tied the most important tools to a
pole that jutted from the top of the robot arm _ a floating tool
belt.
	   Once all the connectors were joined, flight controllers planned
to turn on the power inside the fledgling station.

U.S. vows to keep trying on formula for Kosovo peace
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The United States is pledging to
keep working on a formula for the future of embattled Kosovo
province after the chief ethnic Albanian negotiator rejected the
latest U.S. plan.
	   Fehmi Agani said the new U.S. formula for the future of the
majority Albanian province was ``unacceptable'' because it was too
close to the views of Serbia. Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the
main republic of Yugoslavia.
	   Agani told reporters Monday that the latest American draft could
not be ``considered a basis for ... future negotiations.''
	   Following Agani's announcement, White House spokesman David
Leavy said the Clinton administration was ``determined to push for
a political settlement that will bring autonomy to Kosovo.''
	   Leavy said in Washington that the administration would keep
working on a formula to return to the kind of autonomy the province
had until Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic canceled it a
decade ago.
	   That formula, however, may no longer satisfy ethnic Albanians,
many of whom were radicalized by the bloody Serb crackdown on the
rebel Kosovo Liberation Army, which is fighting for independence.
	   Hundreds were killed and almost 300,000 ethnic Albanians
displaced in a seven-month crackdown by Serbian forces against
Kosovo's separatists, before an October peace agreement brought
about a tentative truce.
	   Most ethnic Albanians want independence or substantial
self-rule, whereas Serbia, in its proposal for Kosovo released last
month, has offered only a degree of autonomy while keeping the
province firmly under Serbian control.
	   ``The new (American) draft is ... almost identical to the
Serbian'' plan, Agani told reporters.
	   The United States is leading diplomatic efforts to hammer out a
solution that is acceptable to both ethnic Albanians and the
Serbian regime.
	   Washington, however, opposes full independence, fearing that
would lead to similar demands by other ethnic Albanian communities
elsewhere in the southern Balkans.
	   That in turn could destabilize what has historically been one of
Europe's most unstable regions.
	   U.S. envoy Christopher Hill, shuttling between Belgrade and
Kosovo, has so far presented four versions of a U.S. formula for
the province. Although fighting has all but ceased since the
October accord, there are fears that Kosovo will again explode in
fierce fighting unless a political solution is found by spring.
	   Agani said the latest American proposal accepts Serbia's main
demand of having Kosovo remain a part of Serbia and substantially
within Serbia's legal system.
	   The previous U.S. draft left out a detailed formula for the
province's final status but ``envisaged... independent institutions
in Kosovo,'' Agani said. He said the earlier draft ``although far
from (ethnic Albanian) demands,'' had at least ``opened up
perspective.''
	   The latest changes in the American draft were
``incomprehensible,'' he said, adding that the ethnic Albanian team
would soon come up with its own proposal for Kosovo.
	   The ethnic Albanians strongly oppose the proposed role of
Kosovo's future parliament which, according to the latest American
draft, would not be able to pass laws. Also, the draft did not
foresee Kosovo having a separate government.
	   Ivan Sedlak, an official on the Serbian negotiating team, said
the latest version of Hill's plan has not been studied by the
Serbian government. He said the previous U.S. version was
unacceptable because it defined Kosovo virtually as a separate
state.

	   SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) _ Two spacewalking astronauts hooked
up all 40 electrical connections between the first two pieces of
the international space station on Monday.
	   To NASA's surprise, the critical wiring job took less time than
expected.
	   Jerry Ross, NASA's most experienced spacewalker, snapped the
connectors together as James Newman handed him the attached cables.
They were mightily impressed with the seven-story station towering
above them.
	   ``This is sure a beautiful piece of hardware,'' Newman said.
	   Ross worked nonstop from the end of Endeavour's 50-foot robot

attached jumper cables there before being hoisted more than 40 feet
to the Russian-built Zarya stacked on top.
	   ``Jerry, How's the view?'' Newman called out from below.
	   ``Fantastic if I had time to look,'' Ross replied.
	   Ross and Newman completed the electrical connections four hours
into their planned 6{-hour spacewalk, the first of three scheduled
for this week. The next step was for flight controllers to turn on
the power inside the fledgling station; electricity had been turned
off to the cables before the spacewalk began, for the astronauts'
safety.

	   SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) _ Two spacewalking astronauts hooked
up all 40 electrical connections between the first two pieces of
the international space station on Monday.
	   To NASA's surprise, the critical wiring job took less time than
expected.
	   Jerry Ross, NASA's most experienced spacewalker, snapped the
connectors together as James Newman handed him the attached cables.
They were mightily impressed with the seven-story station towering
above them.
	   ``This is sure a beautiful piece of hardware,'' Newman said.
	   Ross worked nonstop from the end of Endeavour's 50-foot robot
arm, starting at the bottom with the American-made Unity module. He
attached jumper cables there before being hoisted more than 40 feet
to the Russian-built Zarya stacked on top.
	   ``Jerry, How's the view?'' Newman called out from below.
	   ``Fantastic if I had time to look,'' Ross replied.
	   Ross and Newman completed the electrical connections four hours
into their planned 6{-hour spacewalk, the first of three scheduled
for this week. The next step was for flight controllers to turn on
the power inside the fledgling station; electricity had been turned
off to the cables before the spacewalk began, for the astronauts'
safety.
	   Endeavour's crew used the robot arm and thruster rockets Sunday
to snap together Zarya and Unity, forming a 77-foot, 35-ton tower
in Endeavour's cargo bay. Construction of the space station hinged
on making the electrical hookups, said NASA's lead flight director,
Bob Castle.
	   Unity, a connecting passageway, needs the solar power generated
by the Zarya control module to survive.
	   Working 240 miles above Earth, Ross and Newman had 135 tools at
their disposal and a horde of engineers standing by in two
countries to offer advice. The spacewalkers tied the most important
tools to a pole that jutted from the top of the robot arm _ a
floating tool belt. Newman also strapped a set to his waist; the
tools stretched out behind him as he used a newly installed slide
wire to get from one end of the stack to the other.
	   Newman had the more unwieldy job, Ross the more hand-intensive.
	   It was up to Newman to unclamp the 20- to 30-foot power cables
and hand them, one at a time, to Ross to link to the mate on the
other side. At times, cables seemed to float every which way _ an
octopus, the spacewalkers laughingly called it. The colder the
cables, the stiffer they became, making it difficult for Ross to
join them.
	   Before locking the connectors together, Ross inspected each end
to make sure the dozens of tiny pins inside were not bent or caked
with debris. He handled the connectors gently so as not to damage
them. Each was numbered so there would be no mistakes.
	   Despite the interfering cold, the work went quickly.
	   ``Looking good man,'' Ross told Newman, ``keep it coming.''
	   Each man's spacesuit was equipped with a mini jetpack in case
their safety lines to the shuttle broke. Endeavour is so loaded
that it would be difficult for it to dash after a runaway
spacewalker.
	   NASA deliberately picked two pros for the job and, even then,
had both men go through 200 hours of training underwater, the
closest approximation to weightlessness on Earth.
	   Ross, 50, a husky Air Force colonel, has made four previous
spacewalks and also has real construction experience. He worked in
a steel mill and did highway construction work back in his college
days.
	   The taller, thinner Newman, a 42-year-old physicist, conducted a
station-practice spacewalk in 1993.

U.S. envoy denounces new Bosnian Serb president

	   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The U.S. envoy for Bosnia
denounced the new Bosnian Serb president Monday, saying he has been
working against the 1995 Dayton accords that ended the Bosnian war.
	   The statement by Robert Gelbard indicates Washington's
displeasure with the extreme-nationalist President Nikola Poplasen
and raised the possibility Poplasen might be fired by the
international officials who effectively rule Bosnia under the
Dayton agreement, which calls for the removal of Bosnian officials
who jeopardize the peace deal.
	   ``We are deeply concerned about what we have seen so far from
President Poplasen and his short few weeks in office,'' Gelbard
said in Banja Luka after he met Poplasen and pro-Western acting
Bosnian Serb Premier Milorad Dodik.
	   Poplasen's ``actions and his words have shown us that he is
against the Dayton agreement,'' Gelbard told reporters. ``He
appears to be using democratic mechanism for anti-democratic
purposes.''
	   After meeting with Gelbard, Poplasen said in a statement that he
was ``ready to accept any argument about the violation of the
Dayton agreement and, if it happens, do everything to put a stop to
it.''
	   Poplasen, of the ultra-nationalist Serbian Radical Party, won
presidential elections in the Serb-controlled half of Bosnia last
September over a moderate supported by Western officials.
	   Poplasen's victory dealt a blow to international efforts to
cement peace, encourage ethnic tolerance and impose democracy in
Bosnia after the 1995 agreement ended the 3{-year war.

	   DEVIC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Amid shattered villages and abandoned
homes in rebel-controlled territory in Kosovo, a lone Serb
monastery survives.
	   Although cut off from the world, their phone and electricity
lines severed in battles that raged around them for months, the
nine nuns at the Serbian Orthodox monastery of Devic are determined
to stay put.
	   ``The police advised us to go,'' says Sister Epraksija, 70,
recalling when Serb forces withdrew in October, complying with a

to the Serbian regime, where Serb forces last February launched

the monastery wall in August but caused minimal damage. A miracle,
Epraksija says.
	   No other Serbs live within miles of the nuns.
	   ``We never go there,'' says an ethnic Albanian villager, loading
bricks onto a cart.
	   Behind the monastery's squeaky wooden gate, five tail-wagging
dogs accompany Sister Epraksija, in simple black garb, as she steps
into the yard with an unhurried, limping gait.
	   Shy around strangers, eyes downcast, her natural hospitality
slowly rises to the surface as she proudly shows off the
monastery's 13th-century frescoes.
	   In the medieval dining room, Sister Apipina brings a pot of
fresh coffee and offers plum brandy made by the nuns to guests
sitting at a long oak table.
	   Apipina, who came here from Bosnia 39 years ago, worries how the
nuns will survive Kosovo's bitter winter. The fighting ruined this
year's crop and none dare venture out to the monastery's farm or
forest. Their firewood supply is running out.
	   Sister Anastasija drives weekly to nearby Srbica for groceries.
Her car, the nuns' only link to the outside world, was once fired
at by a KLA patrol but no one was hurt.
	   The sisters refuse to talk politics. Even Andja, 60, the
monastery helper who looks after her nuns and dogs with equal
passion, claims she's ignorant of politicians and their
negotiations.
	   Their greatest worry is the wood stove that was just stolen from
their backyard.
	   Will the fighting break out again in spring?
	   Epraksija doesn't think so.
	   ``Oh yes it will,'' Apipina contradicts her superior. ``It will
happen all over again.''

Former Polish president speaks at Maine college

<TEXT>
	   WATERVILLE, Maine (AP) _ Former Polish president and 1983 Nobel
Peace Prize winner Lech Walesa offered advice to the world's
political leaders: Think in terms of decades, not just winning the
next election.
	   Walesa, leader of a shipyard strike in 1980 that swept across
Poland and ushered in democratic reforms, lectured before an
overflow crowd at Colby College Monday night.
	   The 55-year-old, barrel-chested Walesa said he was inspired by
two beliefs when he led unarmed workers and stared down hard line
communist governments in Poland and the former Soviet Union: belief
in God, and in what he was doing.
	   Speaking through an interpreter to about 600 people at Colby,
Walesa said that work for long-term improvements rarely gets much
attention.
	   ``We live in a time when people remember ... revolutionaries and
people who make scandals,'' said Walesa. ``The people who work very
hard are hardly remembered at all.''
	   He said Solidarity was the result of a conscious decision to
avoid the mistakes of earlier Polish uprisings, in which violent
rebellion had been quashed by the Soviets.
	   ``We said, `We are not going to fight against you with arms
because you will blow up the world. But we're not going to work for
you, either,'' Walesa said.

	   DEVIC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Amid shattered villages and abandoned
homes in rebel-controlled territory in Kosovo, a lone Serb
monastery survives.
	   Although cut off from the world, their phone and electricity
lines severed in battles that raged around them for months, the
nine nuns at the Serbian Orthodox monastery of Devic are determined
to stay put.
	   ``The police advised us to go,'' says Sister Epraksija, 70,
recalling when Serb forces withdrew in October, complying with a
U.S.-sponsored peace agreement.
	   But she won't _ Devic has been her only home for 50 years.

Two police officers killed in Abkhazia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ Unidentified assailants shelled a police
vehicle in Georgia's breakaway region of Abkhazia, killing two
police officers in the separatist territory and wounding two
others, officials said Tuesday.
	   The officers came under attack on Monday in Abkhazia's restive
Ghali region, where militants who support the Georgian government
launch periodic attacks.
	   Separatist Interior Minister Amazbei Kchach blamed the attack on
the Georgian fighters, while the Georgian government denied any
involvement.
	   Abkhazia, a mostly Muslim region along the Black Sea, drove out
Georgian government troops during the 1992-1993 independence war.
Abkhazia has run its own affairs since then, refusing to allow
return of more than 300,000 ethnic Georgian refugees.
	   The province has been plagued by frequent clashes despite the
presence of Russian peacekeepers monitoring the truce since 1994.
	   The most recent attempt at peace between Georgia and Abkhazia
failed last month when Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze and
separatist leader Vladislav Ardzinba canceled talks because of
continuing disagreements.

US vows to keep trying on elusive formula for Kosovo peace
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KATARINA KRATOVAC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The United States vowed to keep
working to find a peace formula for disputed Kosovo province after
the senior ethnic Albanian negotiator rejected the latest U.S.
plan.
	   Fehmi Agani said the new U.S. formula for the future of the
Serbian province and its ethnic Albanian majority was
``unacceptable'' because it was too similar to the views of Serbia,
the main republic of Yugoslavia.
	   Agani told reporters Monday that the latest American draft could
not be ``considered a basis for ... future negotiations.''
	   Following Agani's announcement, White House spokesman David
Leavy said the Clinton administration was ``determined to push for
a political settlement that will bring autonomy to Kosovo.''
	   Hundreds of people were killed and almost 300,000 ethnic
Albanians displaced in a seven-month crackdown by Serbian forces
against separatists in Kosovo. An October peace agreement brought a
tentative truce.
	   Most ethnic Albanians want independence or substantial
self-rule, whereas Serbia, in its proposal for Kosovo released last
month, has offered only a degree of autonomy while keeping the
province firmly under Serbian control.
	   Leavy said in Washington that the Clinton administration would
keep working on a formula for restoring the kind of autonomy that
Kosovo enjoyed until Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
rescinded it a decade ago.
	   That formula, however, may no longer satisfy ethnic Albanians,
many of whom were radicalized by the Serb crackdown on the rebel
Kosovo Liberation Army, which is fighting for independence.
	   ``The new (American) draft is ... almost identical to the
Serbian'' plan, Agani told reporters.
	   Washington opposes full independence for Kosovo's ethnic
Albanians, fearing that would lead to similar demands by ethnic
Albanian communities elsewhere in the southern Balkans.
	   That in turn could destabilize what has historically been one of
Europe's most voltile regions.
	   U.S. envoy Christopher Hill, shuttling between Kosovo and the
Yugoslav capital, Belgrade, has so far presented four versions of a
U.S. formula for the province. Although fighting has all but ceased
since the October accord, many people fear that Kosovo may again
explode in violence.
	   Agani said the fourth and latest American proposal accepts
Serbia's main demand of having Kosovo remain a part of Serbia and
substantially within Serbia's legal system.
	   The previous U.S. draft had ``envisaged... independent
institutions in Kosovo,'' Agani said. Although the earlier draft
was far from ethnic Albanian demands, it had at least ``opened up
perspective,'' he said.
	   The latest changes in the American draft were
``incomprehensible,'' he said.
	   Ethnic Albanians strongly oppose the proposed role of Kosovo's
future parliament which, according to the latest American draft,
would not be able to pass laws. Also, the latest draft did not
foresee Kosovo having a separate government.
	   Ivan Sedlak, a Serbian negotiator, said the Serbian government
had not yet studied the latest version of Hill's plan. He said the
previous U.S. version had been unacceptable because it defined
Kosovo virtually as a separate state.

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO foreign ministers Tuesday began
the process of revising the 16-nation alliance's strategic concept,
the military and political principles that guide the NATO mission.
	   The ministers are laying the groundwork for the 50th anniversary
NATO summit in Washington April 24-25, where leaders are expected
to approve the alliance's strategy for the 21st century and welcome
three new members, Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic.
	   ``One of the special qualities of the alliance has always been
its ability to react flexibly to new situations,'' German Foreign
Minister Joschka Fischer told fellow ministers. ``On the eve of the
21st century we should ask ourselves if our instruments still match
the changed security environment.''
	   Today's threat is no longer a Russian tank assault across the
plains of Central Europe, but challenges from regional conflicts
like Bosnia and Kosovo, terrorism and the spread of weapons of mass
destruction.
	   In practice, NATO has already adjusted to these new realities,
intervening in Bosnia, halting the humanitarian disaster in Kosovo
with the threat of air strikes, sending soldiers just across the
Kosovo border into Macedonia.
	   ``Today we will be discussing the future of NATO and how we are
going to do it in the next century,'' said British Foreign Minister
Robin Cook.
	   He said that Europeans were anxious to play a greater role in
European security issues, particularly in cases where the United
States is less interested in participating, but that such a role
must work through NATO.
	   ``I want to make it clear today that what we want to see is
improvement of security in Europe and strengthening of NATO,'' Cook
said.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, writing in the
British newspaper The Financial Times, said: ``NATO's primary
mission will always remain defense against aggression. But the
founders of the alliance also distinguished between what the treaty
commits us to do and what it permits us to do.''
	   She said Bosnia and Kosovo are recent examples ``that
demonstrate NATO must act when conflicts beyond its immediate
borders affect alliance interests. NATO must find the right balance
between the centrality of NATO's collective defense missions and
responding to such crises.''
	   NATO's central mission will always be collective defense and the
concept that an attack against one member is an aggression against
all. But attacks against members now take different forms and often
originate far away.
	   Albright planned to propose at the ministerial meeting a Center
for Weapons of Mass Destruction, to share and use intelligence,
officials said. The plan would use NATO headquarters staff under
one director, with perhaps a few extra experts, they said.
	   The Germans plan to bring up the nuclear first-strike question
later in the meeting.
	   Fischer made waves when he called on NATO last month to consider
dropping its doctrine allowing a nuclear first-strike. This
doctrine, reaffirmed as recently as last year, has always been a
part of NATO's nuclear strategy and is considered an important
aspect of deterrence.
	   ``The minister will certainly raise the issue,'' a German
diplomatic source said. ``We have to see that in the context of
arms control, arms reduction and nonproliferation.''
	   The Germans don't have much backing on the issue, however.
	   The allies were to assess the situation in Kosovo, where Serb
security forces and ethnic Albanian guerrillas clashed for seven
months. The threat of a NATO air strike stopped the fighting in
October and the cease-fire is generally holding, while American
mediator Christopher Hill attempts to firm the peace with political
agreement.
	   The ministers also were to make their six-monthly review of the
situation in Bosnia. No major reduction in the 32,000-troop level
in the NATO-led peacekeeping force is expected soon.

Government gives money to aid homeless in cold spell
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ With the death toll from more than three
weeks of freezing weather at 91 on Tuesday, the government has
given 5 million zlotys (dlrs 1.5 million) to groups that help the
homeless.
	   Government spokesman Jaroslaw Sellin said the money from
Treasury reserves went to non-government organizations and shelters
for the homeless.
	   Most of the dead from the cold front that arrived Nov. 16 were
drunken men who passed out in the frigid conditions, police say.
Many of the victims were homeless.
	   Shelters for the homeless have been overcrowded and running low
on money. Due to the numbers seeking shelter, welfare groups have
changed their policy and taken in drunken people.
	   The lowest temperature recorded during the cold spell was minus
26 Celsius (minus 4 Fahrenheit). Temperatures have risen this week,
hovering around minus 5 Celsius (23 Fahrenheit) with steady
snowfall in several areas.
	   Police say the death toll from the cold front already far
exceeds the 54 deaths attributed to the cold last winter.

NATO ministers say both sides fail to comply in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO foreign ministers deplored the
continued violence in Kosovo and said in a statement Tuesday that
both Serbs and ethnic Albanians in the province were to blame.
	   ``The security situation in Kosovo remains of great concern to
us,'' the ministers said.
	   ``Since the beginning of November, violent incidents provoked in
some cases by Serbian security forces and in others by armed
Kosovar elements have increased tension. These incidents show that
both the Belgrade authorities and the armed Kosovar elements have
failed to comply fully with the requirements set on in U.N.
Security Council resolutions.''
	   Hundreds of people, mostly civilians, died and hundreds of
thousands were driven from their homes in seven months of fighting
between the Serb police and armed forces and the rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army.
	   Serbia, the dominant republic in what is left of the Yugoslav
federation, withdrew Kosovo's autonomy in 1989. The ethnic Albanian
majority is now demanding independence, something the Belgrade
authorities have rejected.
	   The fighting was halted and a shaky cease-fire installed only
after NATO threatened to conduct air strikes.
	   ``We insist that both sides maintain scrupulously the cease-fire
and comply fully with the U.N. Security Council resolutions,'' the
ministers said in their declaration. ``We also expect them to
facilitate the war crimes investigations by the International
Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. In this connection, we deplore
the denial of visas to ICTY investigators.''

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO foreign ministers today began
revising the political and military principles that have guided the
16-nation alliance for half a century.
	   The ministers are laying the groundwork for an anniversary
summit in Washington in April, where leaders are expected to
approve the alliance's security doctrine for the 21st century and

_ into the fold.

	   Today's threat is no longer a Russian tank assault across the
plains of Central Europe, but challenges from regional conflicts
like Bosnia and Kosovo, terrorism and the spread of weapons of mass
destruction. When these threats originate from outside NATO's
traditional territory of operations, the alliance must be prepared
to deal with them.
	   In practice, NATO has already adjusted to these new realities,
intervening in Bosnia, halting the humanitarian disaster in Kosovo
with the threat of air strikes, sending soldiers just across the
Kosovo border in Macedonia to rescue civilian cease-fire monitors
if needed.
	   ``Today we will be discussing the future of NATO and how we are

always remain defense against aggression. But the founders of the
alliance also distinguished between what the treaty commits us to
do and what it permits us to do.''
	   She said Bosnia and Kosovo are recent examples ``that
demonstrate NATO must act when conflicts beyond its immediate
borders affect alliance interests. NATO must find the right balance
between the centrality of NATO's collective defense missions and
responding to such crises.''
	   NATO's central mission will always be collective defense and the
concept that an attack against one member is an aggression against
all. But attacks against members now take different forms and often
originate far away.
	   Albright planned to propose at the ministerial meeting here
setting up a Center for Weapons of Mass Destruction, officials
said.
	   The plan would use NATO headquarters staff under one director,
with perhaps a few extra experts, they said.
	   The Germans plan to bring up the nuclear first-strike question
later in the meeting.
	   Fischer made waves when he called on NATO last month to consider
dropping its doctrine allowing a nuclear first-strike. This
doctrine, reaffirmed as recently as last year, has always been a
part of NATO's nuclear strategy and is considered an important
aspect of deterrence.
	   ``The minister will certainly raise the issue,'' a German
diplomatic source said. ``We have to see that in the context of
arms control, arms reduction and nonproliferation.''
	   The Germans don't have much backing on the issue, however.
	   The allies were to assess the situation in Kosovo, where Serb
security forces and ethnic Albanian guerrillas clashed for seven
months. The threat of a NATO air strike stopped the fighting in
October and the cease-fire is generally holding, while American
mediator Christopher Hill attempts to firm the peace with political
agreement.
	   The ministers also were to make their six-monthly review of the
situation in Bosnia. No major reduction in the 32,000-troop level
in the NATO-led peacekeeping force is expected soon.

Poland rejects missile deal with Israel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Poland on Tuesday rejected a previous deal
to arm its Huzar helicopter with Israeli-made missile, Prime
Minister Jerzy Buzek announced.
	   Buzek made the announcement after a weekly Cabinet meeting.
	   Following years of negotiating with several potential partners,
Poland last year awarded the dlrs 800 million contract to Israel's
Rafael and Elbit Systems Ltd. to equip the Huzar helicopters in
line with NATO requirements.
	   Poland, which plans to join NATO in April, selected the Israeli
companies over the U.S. company Boeing.
	   Under the deal, which required approval from both governments,
Rafael was to supply the Huzar with anti-tank NTD missiles and
Elbit was to provide electronic integrating systems.
	   But Poland's Solidarity-led government, which took office
shortly after the agreement was signed, criticized the handling of
the tenders by its ex-communist predecessors and demanded missile
tests. It also decided to seek another tender for the integrating
systems, but has set no date for it.
	   Last week the defense ministry said that Israel failed to offer
the missiles for tests in Polish weather and terrain conditions by
November, as was earlier agreed.

Ukrainian president vetoes bill on minimum wage hike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma vetoed
Tuesday a bill that would have raised the country's minimum wage,
arguing the hike would force the government to make massive layoffs
and print more money, a news report said Monday.
	   The legislature voted last month to nearly triple the monthly
minimum wage from 55 hryvna (dlrs 16) to 148 hryvna (dlrs 43), and
also set the official poverty level at 118.6 hryvna (dlrs 35) a
month.
	   Kuchma said the government can't afford the new minimum wage,
and would have to fire 60 percent of state employees and sharply
raise taxes to balance its books, the Interfax news agency
reported.
	   Implementation of the law through a different option _ by
printing more money _ would increase quadruple inflation by the end
of 1998 and boost it by more than 100 times next year, Kuchma said.
	   Nearly all Ukrainians earn more than the minimum wage, and the
average monthly salary was about 170 hryvna (dlrs 50) in the first
half of 1998.
	   The minimum wage and poverty level figures, though, are used to
calculate various payments throughout the country.
	   Ukraine's leftist-dominated parliament has long favored extra
spending for social needs and has regularly made attempts to
increase the minimum wage despite government objections.

 &UR; Torture of Kosovo Albanians widespread in Serbian jails

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) - More than 1,000 Kosovo Albanians are
believed to be in Serbian prisons and police stations, and at least
five have died from beatings and torture, the U.S.-based Human
Rights Watch said Tuesday.
	   ``Five individuals are known to have died in detention since
July 1998 from the violence inflicted on them by the police prison
guards,'' said a Human Rights Watch statement.
	   The statement, faxed to The Associated Press bureau in Belgrade,
said hundreds of others have been injured from beatings and
torture, often used to extract confessions.
	   The latest government figures say that 684 ethnic Albanians have
been arrested for allegedly supporting ``terrorism'' since
February. That is when authorities began a crackdown on ethnic
Albanian separatists in Kosovo, a majority Albanian Serbian
province.
	   But the Human Rights Watch said in the statement that local and
international human rights groups believe the actual number of
those arrested is closer to 1,500, including human rights
activists, doctors, humanitarian aid workers and lawyers, ``many of
whom were physically abused.''
	   ``The Serbian government's military offensive may have slowed
down for winter,'' said Holly Cartner, Executive Director of Human
Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia Division. ``But the legal
offensive is in full swing, despite the government's promise to
grant amnesty.''
	   On Oct. 14, the Serbian government announced general amnesty for
``crimes related to the conflict in Kosovo'' and promised that no
one would be prosecuted ``except for crimes against humanity and
international law.''
	   ``Despite those promises, large number of ethnic Albanians
remain in custody and Human Rights Watch has no information that
anyone arrested during the conflict has been released as a result
of this amnesty.''
	   ``Simply being an Albanian in Kosovo is enough to merit an
arrest and torture,'' Ms. Cartner said in the statement, which
added that ``In addition to the use of torture to extract
confessions, defendants are often denied access to a lawyer, not
allowed to view court documents, or refused permission to present
witnesses in their behalf.''
	   The human rights organization also documented illegal detentions
of Serbs and ethnic Albanians loyal to the government by the rebel
ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army which has been fighting
government troops.
	   ``Estimates of ethnic Serbs and Albanians abducted by the KLA
range from 100 to 300, but it is not known whether those people
have fled the region, are in hiding, have been killed, or are
currently in KLA custody,'' the statement said.
	   The International Red Cross ``has been denied access to KLA
detainees, which raises additional concerns for their safety,'' it
added.

NATO revising strategy in line with changes in Europe
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Solana, Cook quotes, Kosovo, Bosnia
reviews. No Pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO foreign ministers began the
process Tuesday of revising the 16-nation alliance's strategic
concept, the military and political principles that guide the NATO
mission.
	   The ministers are laying the groundwork for the 50th anniversary
NATO summit in Washington April 24-25, where leaders are expected
to approve the alliance's strategy for the 21st century and welcome
three new members, Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, into the
fold.
	   ``One of the special qualities of the alliance has always been
its ability to react flexibly to new situations,'' German Foreign
Minister Joschka Fischer told fellow ministers. ``On the eve of the
21st century we should ask ourselves if our instruments still match
the changed security environment.''
	   Today's threat is no longer a Russian tank assault across the
plains of Central Europe, but challenges from regional conflicts
like Bosnia and Kosovo, terrorism and the spread of weapons of mass
destruction. When these threats originate from outside NATO's
traditional territory of operations, the alliance must be prepared
to deal with them.
	   In practice, NATO has already adjusted to these new realities,
intervening in Bosnia, halting the humanitarian disaster in Kosovo
with the threat of airstrikes, sending soldiers just across the
Kosovo border in Macedonia to rescue civilian cease-fire monitors
if needed.
	   ``NATO is already acting out of area, so let's not dramatize
that,'' said NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana.
	   Added British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook: ``I think we have to
be pragmatic and grown up about this. That will require making a
judgment on a case-by-case basis.''
	   Cook stressed the increased role that the Europeans want to play
in continental security, particularly in cases where the United
States is less interested in participating. NATO is developing a
policy it calls the European Security and Defense Identity to deal
with that, but France and Britain are pressing for the European
Union to play a role too.
	   ``The focus must be strengthening and improving the European
security identity,'' Cook said, stressing nonetheless that ``NATO
will remain the basis for territorial defense for the EU.''
	   Solana said the European Union economic alliance is changing and
NATO's plans must be adapted to the changes. ``We are trying to
reconcile these things.''
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, writing in the
British newspaper The Financial Times, said: ``NATO's primary
mission will always remain defense against aggression. But the
founders of the alliance also distinguished between what the treaty
commits us to do and what it permits us to do.''
	   She said Bosnia and Kosovo are recent examples ``that
demonstrate NATO must act when conflicts beyond its immediate
borders affect alliance interests. NATO must find the right balance
between the centrality of NATO's collective defense missions and
responding to such crises.''
	   NATO's central mission will always be collective defense and the
concept that an attack against one member is an aggression against
all. But attacks against members now take different forms and often
originate far away.
	   Albright planned to propose at the ministerial meeting here
setting up a Center for Weapons of Mass Destruction, essentially on
how to best share and use intelligence, officials said.
	   The Germans plan to bring up the nuclear first-strike question
later in the meeting.
	   Fischer made waves when he called on NATO last month to consider
dropping its doctrine allowing a nuclear first-strike. This
doctrine, reaffirmed as recently as last year, has always been a
part of NATO's nuclear strategy and is considered an important
aspect of deterrence.
	   ``The minister will certainly raise the issue,'' a German
diplomatic source said. ``We have to see that in the context of
arms control, arms reduction and nonproliferation.''
	   The Germans don't have much backing on the issue, however.
	   The allies assessed the situation in Kosovo, where Serb security
forces and ethnic Albanian guerrillas clashed for seven months. The
threat of a NATO airstrike stopped the fighting in October and the
cease-fire is generally holding, while U.S.mediator Christopher
Hill attempts to firm the peace with political agreement.
	   The ministers also made their six-monthly review of the
situation in Bosnia. No major reduction in the 32,000-troop level
in the NATO-led peacekeeping force is expected soon.

Unemployment up, labor office cites unseasonable cold
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with additional comment, specifies seasonally adjusted
increase in 3rd graf; No pickup. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Germany's persistently high
joblessness remained below 4 million in November for the third
straight month, though the unemployment rate rose slightly, to 10.2
percent, the Labor Office in Nuremberg reported Tuesday.
	   Nationwide, 3.95 million people were jobless, 54,300 more than
in October, when Germany reached its lowest unemployment rate _
10.1 percent _ in two years.
	   The seasonally adjusted rise of 4,000 jobs was far above
analysts' expectations. But Labor Office chief Bernhard Jagoda said
the numbers did not signal a turn for the worse in the German labor
market.
	   ``If December doesn't present any surprises we'll see the 1998
average jobless slightly below 4.3 million at the end of the
year,'' Jagoda said.
	   Jagoda blamed the dip on unseasonably cold weather and a slowing
of jobs-creation policies that were credited with easing the rate
in September and October. He did not rule out that harsh weather
conditions could again adversely affect the employment picture in
December.
	   Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder has made tackling unemployment a
top priority of his new administration, which took office in
October. His key strategy, creating jobs through talks with unions,
industry and politicians, was launched Monday with a pledge to
lower taxes for business and improve early retirement packages to
put younger Germans to work.
	   Unemployment rose by 1 percent in both in eastern and western
Germany, to 15.9 percent in the east, and 8.8 percent in the west.
Joblessness has been most severe in the east, which is still
adjusting to a market economy after unifying with the capitalist
west in 1990.

Former player says Shane Warne, Mark Waugh took bookie's money
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: Adds new details, recasts, changes headline &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Australian test cricketers Mark
Waugh and Shane Warne were paid by an Indian bookmaker for weather
and pitch reports during the 1994 tour of Sri Lanka and Pakistan,
former Australian international David Hookes said Tuesday.
	   The Australian Cricket Board (ACB) fined the high-profile pair a
substantial amount _ Australian Associated Press says it was a
five-figure amount _ but say the board did not make it public until
the story leaked to the media.
	   David Hookes, a former player and now commentator, said on a
Melbourne radio station on Tuesday night that Waugh and Warne _ two
of Australia's highest-paid cricketers _ were paid by the bookie
during the sub-continent tour.
	   ``In 1994, Mark Waugh accepted money from an Indian bookmaker to
give a report on the ground and weather conditions for some of the
upcoming matches in that series,'' Hookes said on radio 3AW.
	   ``I must say that any suggestion that bribery was involved has
been outright denied by a spokesman for Mark Waugh and the Players
Association themselves and I also believe that Mark Waugh was
punished and fined by the ACB at the time with the results passed
onto the ICC (International Cricket Council).
	   ``And I'm also led to believe that Shane Warne was also involved
. . . He also accepted money from the bookmaker giving ground
reports and weather conditions.''
	   Hookes said Waugh went to the ACB in 1994 after receiving some
money because he was concerned about the legitimacy of it.
	   ``It should be stressed that Mark Waugh I believe went to the
ACB in 1994 after receiving some money and said he wasn't sure
whether he was doing the right thing or the wrong thing and he
wanted the hierarchy to know what happened and to throw it back
into their court,'' he said.
	   Both Waugh and Warne will appear at a media conference in
Adelaide on Wednesday where the Australian team is preparing for
the start of Friday's third Ashes test against England.
	   ACB chief executive Mal Speed told ABC radio that the two
players were fined after the tour of Pakistan before they went to
the West Indies in 1995, but gave no other information.
	   The revelations are sure to be of interest throughout the
cricket world, particularly in Pakistan where an official inquiry
has been held into charges
	   of bribery against players.
	   Australia's 1994 tour of Pakistan has become notorious for
charges of match-fixing and bribery leveled against then Pakistani
captain Salim Malik.
	   Waugh, Warne and former player Tim May had accused Malik of
attempting to
	   bribe them. Malik has protested his innocence.
	   Justice Malik Mohammad Qayyum is due to submit his report on the
match-fixing scandal to Pakistan president Mohammad Rafiq Tarar in
the next two weeks.
	   Waugh, Warne and May were unavailable for comment on Tuesday
night.
	   Leg spinner Warne, 29, made his test debut against India in
1991-92 in Sydney, and has toured the sub-continent four times.
	   Warne has taken 308 test wickets at 24.10 to rank among the
all-time great bowlers, but shoulder surgery in April after this
year's tour in India has so far stopped him returning to the test
side.
	   In his autobiography Warne wrote: ``The whole betting scene in
India and Pakistan is illegal so the people running the betting are
basically gangsters. Not the sort of people to trust or play around
with.''
	   Waugh, the twin of vice-captain Steve Waugh, made his debut in
1990-91 against England in Adelaide.
	   The 33-year-old has been a mainstay of Australia's middle order
in 80 test matches, making more than 5,000 runs, averaging around
43. (djp)

South Korean soldier arrested for making contact with guards from
</HEADLINE>
North

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A South Korean soldier was arrested
Tuesday on charges of having made illegal contact with North Korean
officers at the heavily-guarded border separating the two rival
states, the Defense Ministry said Tuesday.
	   The soldier allegedly crossed the border at night several times
last year and received cigarettes, drinks and other gifts from
North Korean officers assigned to lure South Korean soldiers
stationed at the divided Panmunjom truce village over to their
side, the ministry said.
	   The ministry identified the suspect only as Sgt. 1st Class Kim.
	   At least two other soldiers were under investigation on similar
charges, it said.
	   The American-led U.N. Command, which controls half of Panmunjom,
said Tuesday it was cooperating with the investigation.
	   Under the U.N. flag, a battalion of American and South Korean
soldiers guard the southern half of Panmunjom, a 400 meter (1,320
foot)-radius plot which serves as the sole contact point in the
demilitarized zone, or DMZ, separating the two Koreas.
	   South Korean officials began the investigation after they were
tipped off by a North Korean border guard who defected to the South
in February, the ministry said.
	   It also said it was investigating whether Kim was involved in
the death of his platoon leader, 1st Lt. Kim Hoon, who was found
shot in the head in a bunker in February.
	   Earlier this year, a joint investigation team of South Korean
and American officers concluded the lieutenant had killed himself.
	   Upon petition by his family, however, a South Korean
Parliamentary committee has re-opened the investigating into the
cause of death.
	   The two Koreas are still technically at war because the 1950-53
Korean War ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty. South
Koreans are banned by law from meeting North Koreans without
government permission.
	   The 1953 Korean armistice was signed at Panmunjom between North
Korea and U.N. forces, which fought the war on the South's side.
Both sides keep liaison officers at Panmunjom.
	   American war dead are also handed over through the truce
village.

U.N. refugee agency closes office in southern Vietnam
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees is closing
its office in southern Vietnam after 25 years during which it
helped more than one million people emigrate and provided security
to those forced to return.
	   Spokeswoman Judith Kumin said Tuesday the agency is satisfied
that its programs _ introduced to cope with the refugee crisis
after the Vietnam War and costing dlrs 100 million in total _ had
successfully been completed.
	   ``There were ups and downs but on the whole it was a remarkable
quarter century of cooperation,'' said Kumin.
	   Soren Jessen-Petersen, the assistant high commissioner, will
visit Vietnam Wednesday and Thursday for ceremonies marking the
25th anniversary and the closure of the office in Ho Chi Minh City,
formerly Saigon.
	   UNHCR will keep open a small office in the capital Hanoi to
promote refugee law.
	   The agency started relief work in U.S.-backed South Vietnam and
the Communist North in 1973. It formally opened an office in 1975,
when the Communist victory prompted a mass exodus of people from
the South in rickety boats.
	   Over the years since 1979, UNHCR helped 700,000 boat people who
arrived in Hong Kong and other Asian nations to settle abroad. The
United States, Canada, Australia and France took many of them.
	   Anxious to provide a safer alternative to the dramatic boat
departures, it persuaded the Vietnamese government in 1979 to sign
an ``orderly departure program'' for people wishing to leave. Under
this arrangement, an additional 600,000 Vietnamese were able to
emigrate legally over a period of 18 years.
	   The exodus of boat people continued throughout the 1980s but the
offers of refuge dried up. In 1989, 70 governments signed a deal
with UNHCR to help house genuine refugees and speed the return of
those who were classed as economic migrants rather than political
refugees.
	   UNHCR helped return 110,000 migrants to Vietnam, giving them
financial help and monitoring for possible reprisals from its
office in southern Ho Chi Minh City.
	   ``UNHCR was able to monitor their situation after return
throughout the country, even to the remote villages, and that
operation has now been completed,'' said Kumin.

NATO ministers keep level of Bosnia force unchanged
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO foreign ministers agreed Tuesday
to leave NATO-led multinational peacekeeping force in Bosnia at its
current 32,000-troop level.
	   The Bosnia Stabilization Force ``cannot be maintained
indefinitely nor does it reduce the responsibility of the
authorities (in Bosnia) to ensure the stability of their country,''
the ministers said in a statement.
	   They also said one of the key tasks for 1999 would be to
accelerate the return of refugees to areas where they represent an
ethnic minority.
	   The return of refugees to their homes has been slow since the
three-year war ended in December 1995 with the signing of the
Dayton peace accord.
	   Many Bosnian Muslims returning to areas where they are a
minority have faced ethnic tensions. Often they find their houses
have been destroyed or that Serb families have moved in.
	   The statement said much had been achieved in rebuilding Bosnia
since the war. But there is ``still much to be done to reinforce
the fragile democracy taking root'' in the country, it added.
	   Areas that require particular effort are the establishment of
the rule of law, the development of common institutions for the
state, the fight against corruption, and ethnic integration.

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Police raided the homes of two Chinese democracy
campaigners on Tuesday, taking them into custody and seizing
literature for a planned opposition party, a rights group reported.
	   The detentions of Zhang Baoqin and Liu Xianbin brought to at
least 10 the number of China Democracy Party members held in
detainment since a crackdown began nine days ago. While most have
been released, three leading organizers were still in custody,
having been accused of endangering national security.
	   About 20 police officers kicked in the door to Zhang's home in
Changle city in the southeastern province of Fujian, the Hong
Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic
Movement reported.
	   Police provoked an argument with him, would not let other family
members watch and did not present arrest or search warrants, the
group said. It added that his whereabouts were not known.
	   Zhang and four other China Democracy Party supporters issued a
statement last week calling for the release of arrested party
members, the Information Center said.
	   Liu, 30, was taken from his home in Suining in the western
province of Sichuan at 4 a.m., the Information Center said. It said
his whereabouts are unknown.
	   A group of six police officers took a fax machine and a large
amount of documents, the report said.
	   Liu, who spent two years in prison in the early 1990s for
pro-democracy activism, co-signed a petition to the Chinese
legislature in March calling for the release of political prisoners
and better protection of human rights.
	   Prosecutors are preparing to put one leader of the China
Democracy Party, Wang Youcai, on trial for subversion next week.
	   Wang's wife, Hu Jiangxia, has sent a letter on his behalf to
U.N. leaders gathering in Paris this week to celebrate the 50th
anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the
Information Center said.
	   The letter noted that by setting up a political party, Wang
wanted to raise awareness of rights.
	   Police confiscated 2,000 copies of the Universal Declaration and
the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights that he
had printed and planned to distribute, the Information Center said.

Parliament's annual meeting expected to discuss Lockerbie
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) _ Libya's parliament on Tuesday began its
annual deliberations on local and foreign issues, and they were
expected to discuss the proposed trial of two Libyans wanted in the
bombing of a Pan Am jetliner.
	   Representatives of some Arab and European political parties
addressed the opening session of the General People's Congress, or
parliament, in the coastal town of Sirte. Sirte is 400 kilometers
(250 miles) east of the Libyan capital Tripoli.
	   The proceedings were broadcast live and monitored by The
Associated Press in Tripoli and in the Egyptian capital, Cairo.
	   Topics related to foreign policy are the last items on the
parliament's agenda. The meeting was expected to last five days.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan met with Libyan leader Moammar
Gadhafi on Saturday in the desert near Sirte but failed to reach
agreement on bringing the suspects to trial for the 1988 bombing
over Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed 270 people.
	   Annan later told reporters that the talks were positive and he
expected a decision from Libya in the near future.
	   Annan is trying to get Libya to go along with a joint
U.S.-British plan to try the two suspects before a panel of
Scottish judges in the Netherlands.
	   Libya _ which had resisted any attempts to extradite Abdel
Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah on grounds they
couldn't get a fair trial in the West _ has accepted the
U.S.-British offer in principle.
	   But the Libyans have expressed concerns for the suspects'
security in the Netherlands, saying they feared they could be
kidnapped and taken to the United States. They also have asked that
if convicted, the men serve their sentences in Libya.
	   Libyan media suggested that Gadhafi does not have the authority
to hand over the suspects and indicated that any such decision
should be approved by the People's Congress.

Unemployed man wants to sell his kidney to feed family
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ A chronically unemployed man is ready to
sell one of his kidneys in a bid to feed his pregnant wife and two
daughters, the daily Jutarnji list reported Tuesday.
	   Zlatko Vidanovic's wife, Andjela, appealed through the paper for
help in finding her husband a job because ``he wants to sell his
kidney to feed us.''
	   The man has been unemployed since demobilizing from the army
after Croatia's 1991 war against Serb rebels. The former salesman
and his family live on the equivalent of dlrs 180 a month in social
welfare for veterans.
	   Unemployment is double digit and most Croatians have trouble
makings ends meet on the equivalent of dlrs 450 a month, the
average wage. Adding to discontent is the perception of widespread
corruption among government ranks.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) - A planned antigovernment demonstration
drew less people then expected on Tuesday, easing police fears that
it would generate another round of violence in politically unstable
Albania.
	   Hundreds of anti-communist protesters marched from the
university to the downtown headquarters of the Democratic Party, as
they heeded a call by former President Sali Berisha to commemorate
a pro-democracy student protest eight years ago. The crowd grew to
3,000 after congregating at central Skanderbeg Square, but
dispersed later without incident.

	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ A pan-African conference on refugees that
begins here Thursday will be attended by 42 African states of which
27 will be represented at Cabinet level, the Sudanese government
said Tuesday.
	   The five-day conference called by the Organization of African
Unity will tackle the relatively recent development of armed
refugees, such as the Hutu militia from Rwanda that have taken
refuge in the Democratic Republic of Congo and who are alleged to
be a source of instability in both Congo and Rwanda.
	   ``In the past, refugees were the product of conflicts. Now
refugees are producing conflicts,'' the chairman of the OAU
refugees committee, Osman Essaid, told a news conference in the
Sudanese capital, Khartoum, on Tuesday.
	   The Sudanese government is pleased by the expected attendance as

 &UR; Forty-odd African states to attend refugee conference in Sudan

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ A pan-African conference on refugees that
begins here Thursday will be attended by 42 African states of which
27 will be represented at Cabinet level, the Sudanese government
said Tuesday.
	   The five-day conference called by the Organization of African
Unity will tackle the relatively recent development of armed
refugees, such as the Hutu militia from Rwanda that have taken
refuge in the Democratic Republic of Congo and who are alleged to
be a source of instability in both Congo and Rwanda.
	   ``In the past, refugees were the product of conflicts. Now
refugees are producing conflicts,'' the chairman of the OAU
refugees committee, Osman Essaid, told a news conference in the
Sudanese capital, Khartoum, on Tuesday.
	   The Sudanese government is pleased by the expected attendance as
it is one of the more isolated administrations in Africa. Egypt,
Eritrea and Uganda have accused neighboring Sudan of supporting
their insurgents; and the United States maintains limited sanctions
against Sudan, accusing it of supporting international terrorism.
Sudan denies the charges.
	   ``We are honored to have such a big gathering of African
ministers and officials in our country,'' Foreign Minister Mustafa
Osman Ismail told the news conference.
	   The Khartoum government says it hosts at least 1.1 million of
Africa's 8 million refugees. The refugees in Sudan come mainly from
Uganda, Eritrea and Ethiopia.

Mori rolls over former drug cheat as Japan takes control

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Japanese swimmers flushed away a
Chinese drugs aftertaste in a night of triumph at the Asian Games
swim meet Tuesday, winning four golds to their rivals' none in the
session.
	   China imposed a humiliating 25-5 defeat in the pool when Japan
was host for the 1994 Games at Hiroshima, only to plunge into
disgrace after seven members tested positive for steroids.
	   One of those, Xiong Guoming, returned to Asian Games action
Tuesday after his four gold medals in 1994 were followed by his
positive steroid test and subsequent two-year ban.
	   Xiong almost made a winning comeback but was beaten by Japan's
Takahiro Mori in a thrilling finish to their 400-meter individual
medley.
	   Mori joined compatriots Masami Tanaka, Takashi Yamamoto and the
men's 4x200-meter relay team on the gold medal dais Tuesday as
Japan led China 6-3 with 10 of the 32 golds decided.
	   ``We had a team meeting on the first night here and we agreed to
ourselves that we would beat China,'' Mori said Tuesday. ``Compared
with four years ago, the Japanese team is stronger. But China's
younger swimmers are strong too.''
	   Xiong held a healthy lead halfway through the race but Mori, 18,
did the damage over the first 50 meters of the final leg of
freestyle. He clocked 4 minutes, 20.98 seconds, with Xiong touching
in 4:22.57 and Thailand's Ratapong Sirisanont third in 4:24.15.
	   There were also traces of China's drug past in the women's
200-meter breaststroke, won by Tanaka, who has the sixth best time
in the world this year.
	   The 1994 champion was Yuan Yuan, who did not test positive in
Hiroshima but was nabbed earlier this year with 13 vials of banned
growth hormone in her luggage as she arrived for the world
championships in Perth, Australia.
	   Tanaka, 19, won in 2 minutes, 28.44 seconds against China's Qi
Hui (2:28.71) as even the tight finishes fell Japan's way. Japan's
Junko Isoda was third.
	   Yamamoto gave Japan a fine start Tuesday when he claimed the
100-meter butterfly in 53.34 seconds.
	   China was also upstaged by Tsai Shu-min, who gave Taiwan its
first gold of the meet by winning the women's 200-meter freestyle.
	   Tsai, the top-ranked member of the field, having clocked the
seventh fastest time in the world this year, started slowly in lane
2 but turned up the tempo from the 100-meter mark.
	   She swept away from early leader Sachiko Yamada, who finished
third. China's Qin Caini improved down the stretch for silver.
	   Japan's hopes of revenge for 1994 received another boost Tuesday
with word that Chinese world champion Chen Yan is in doubt for the
rest of the meet after suffering diarrhea. She was badly beaten in
her favorite 400-meter medley Monday by Japan's Yasuko Tajima, and
didn't swim in Tuesday's freestyle heats.
	   ``As she is rather weak now, whether she will continue to
compete in the games is still in doubt, not to say winning gold,''
said coach Han Mingyan. The 200 medley is still to come.
	   Swimmers from other countries have complained long and hard
about the Chinese, and the East Germans before them. The U.S.
Olympic Committee is seeking gold medals for a relay team beaten by
a drug-tainted East German outfit, while some Australian swimmers
have claimed that drugs, rather than talent, cost them medals at
the 1992 Olympics and 1994 Rome world championships.
	   But Japanese team spokesman Shiego Ogata said his country did
not come here for revenge based on the 1994 results and subsequent
scandals.
	   ``We don't care about individual countries,'' Ogata said
Tuesday. ``We just want everyone to be clean.''
	   China has failed to make the same impact at any meet since the
1994 Asian Games, while International Olympic Committee president
Juan Antonio Samaranch has praised its recent efforts to eradicate
drug use.

Angolan soldiers, rebels said to be fighting in Republic of Congo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LOUIS OKAMBA &QC;

<TEXT>
	   BRAZZAVILLE, Republic of Congo (AP) _ Angolan rebel forces are
fighting alongside an outlawed militia group that is battling
government forces south of Brazzaville, Republic of Congo officials
charged Tuesday.
	   Angolan government troops, meanwhile, have entered the fray to
help the Republic of Congo government, a military official said on
condition of anonymity.
	   The official said that 120 Angolan soldiers were now fighting
alongside government soldiers in the Pool region south of
Brazzaville, where the outlawed ``Ninja'' militia have launched a
series of attacks. Congolese officials said soldiers from the
Angolan rebel group UNITA had joined up with the Ninjas.
	   ``We believe that elements of UNITA are fighting beside these
bandits trying to spread grief,'' Communications Minister and
government spokesman Francois Ibovi said.
	   The accusation of UNITA involvement comes as government forces
are fighting the Ninjas near the site of a failed ambush Saturday
that left 60 rebels dead, according to a senior military official
said.
	   The fighting was taking place in the Mindouli district, 25
kilometers (15 miles) away from the southern rebel stronghold of
Ntadi.
	   The military official said that the Ninja fighters, loyal to
ousted Prime Minister Bernard Kolelas, control Mindouli and the
nearby town of Missafou.
	   Ibovi declined to comment on whether the rebels had control of
the towns, but said they ``can't hold on more than 48 hours.''
	   Kolelas was a sometime-ally of ousted president Pascal Lissouba.
	   Both fled the country after President Denis Sassou-Nguesso
defeated Lissouba in a five-month civil war last year, but the
Ninjas have resisted disarmament and are waging a campaign against
Sassou-Nguesso's government.
	   Since his takeover, Sassou-Nguesso has outlawed all militia
groups including his own Cobras.
	   Angola turned the tide in Republic of Congo's civil war, coming
in to help Sassou-Nguesso and helping him defeat Lissouba. Many
Angolan soldiers stayed in Republic of Congo after the war ended.

Russian hard currency reserves fall 8 percent in a month
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with prospects on budget approval in new grafs 8-11,

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's hard currency reserves fell 8 percent
last month, drained by debt payments and efforts to prop up the
increasingly weak ruble, officials said Tuesday.
	   The Central Bank's reserves, which stood at dlrs 13.6 billion at
the start of November, shrank to dlrs 12.5 billion by the end of
the month, the Interfax news agency reported, quoting a bank
announcement.
	   Reserves have dropped by nearly 30 percent since the start of
the year, the bank said.
	   The Central Bank lowered its reserves trying to halt the steady
decline of the ruble, which is now trading at more than 20 to the
U.S. dollar. Before the economic crisis hit in August, the ruble
was trading at around 6 to the dollar.
	   Since Russia's financial meltdown in August, on the heels of
erupting economic chaos in Asia, the ruble has been closely watched
as a bellwether of economic confidence in the country.
	   The currency's steady dive has reflected fears that the
government will crank up the printing presses to pay domestic and
foreign debts _ a strategy almost certain to result in high
inflation.
	   In other bad news, overall government revenues totaled 215.7
billion rubles (dlrs 10.8 billion) for the first 10 months of the
year, or 59 percent of target levels, the Finance Ministry said,
according to the Interfax news agency.
	   The government's chronic inability to meet tax collection and
revenue targets has been a serious stumbling block in its efforts
to reform the economy.
	   After several delays, the Cabinet plans to pass the 1999 budget
on Thursday and will submit the document to the parliament soon
after, officials said. The budget will include bills aimed at
streamlining the country's unwieldy tax system.
	   In the past few years, the government and the parliament have
failed to finalize the budget before the start of the budget year,
further complicating the process.
	   First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov said Tuesday he
expects swift passage of the budget by the parliament this year.
``The government will undoubtedly reach an accord with deputies,
and the draft budget will be approved,'' he said.
	   Unlike previous cabinets, the current government enjoys broad
support in the Communist-dominated State Duma, or lower house.
Maslyukov, a Communist, previously headed the parliament's economic
affairs committee.
	   In other economic developments:
	   _ Russian crude oil production dropped 1 percent from January
through October, to 244.4 million metric tons, the State Statistics
Committee said Tuesday.
	   _ Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir Bulgak called on the European
Union on Monday to revoke anti-dumping measures against Russian
exports. The measures incur annual losses of some dlrs 300 million
to Russia, the Interfax news agency reported.

 &UR; Torture of Kosovo Albanians widespread in Serbian jails, human
rights group says &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ More than 1,000 Kosovo Albanians are
believed to be in Serbian prisons and police stations, and at least
five have died from beatings and torture, the U.S.-based Human
Rights Watch said Tuesday.
	   ``Five individuals are known to have died in detention since
July 1998 from the violence inflicted on them by the police prison
guards,'' said a Human Rights Watch statement.
	   The statement, faxed to The Associated Press bureau in Belgrade,
said hundreds of others have been injured from beatings and
torture, often used to extract confessions.
	   The latest government figures say that 684 ethnic Albanians have
been arrested for allegedly supporting ``terrorism'' since
February. That is when authorities began a crackdown on ethnic
Albanian separatists in Kosovo, a majority Albanian province in
Serbia.
	   But the Human Rights Watch said in the statement that local and
international human rights groups believe the actual number of
those arrested is closer to 1,500, including human rights
activists, doctors, humanitarian aid workers and lawyers, ``many of
whom were physically abused.''
	   ``The Serbian government's military offensive may have slowed
down for winter,'' said Holly Cartner, Executive Director of Human
Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia Division. ``But the legal
offensive is in full swing, despite the government's promise to
grant amnesty.''
	   On Oct. 14, the Serbian government announced general amnesty for
``crimes related to the conflict in Kosovo'' and promised that no
one would be prosecuted ``except for crimes against humanity and
international law.''
	   ``Despite those promises, large number of ethnic Albanians
remain in custody and Human Rights Watch has no information that
anyone arrested during the conflict has been released as a result
of this amnesty.''
	   ``Simply being an Albanian in Kosovo is enough to merit an
arrest and torture,'' Ms. Cartner said in a statement. She also
said defendants are often denied access to a lawyer, not allowed to
view court documents, or refused permission to present witnesses in
their defense.
	   The human rights organization also documented illegal detentions
of Serbs and ethnic Albanians loyal to the government by the rebel
ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army which has been fighting
government troops.
	   ``Estimates of ethnic Serbs and Albanians abducted by the KLA
range from 100 to 300, but it is not known whether those people
have fled the region, are in hiding, have been killed, or are
currently in KLA custody,'' the statement said.
	   The International Red Cross ``has been denied access to KLA
detainees, which raises additional concerns for their safety,'' it
added.

Governing party ready to allow foreigners to invest in insurance
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ The governing party Tuesday resolved
differences among its members over allowing foreign investment in
Indian insurance companies and plans to introduce a bill in
Parliament later this week, a party spokesman said.
	   Madan Lal Khurana, the parliamentary affairs minister, told
reporters that the Bharatiya Janata Party lawmakers at a meeting
unanimously decided to support the government on the issue, Dow
Jones News Wires reported. The main opposition Congress party
supports the bill, greatly increasing its chances of becoming law.
	   The bill, which proposes to allow up to 40 percent foreign
investment in Indian insurance companies, was delayed because of
opposition within the Bharatiya Janata Party even after the federal
Cabinet had cleared the proposal.
	   Several senior BJP leaders look with suspicion on outside
influence on the Indian economy and are opposed to opening up the
insurance business to the private companies.
	   Several workers' unions and political parties have announced a
nationwide strike Dec. 11 against the government's decision to open
up .
	   The All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, a southern
regional ally of the governing 19-party coalition, said it also
would join the strike against the economic policies of Prime
Minister Atal Bihari Vaypayee's government. But the party continues
to be part of the coalition.
	   Last month, a cabinet committee decided to allow foreigners to
own up to 26 percent of private Indian insurance companies, and
said an additional 14 percent could be held by Indians based
overseas.

Eintracht Frankfurt fires coach
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Eintracht Frankfurt on Tuesday fired
coach Horst Ehrmantraut, who had guided the Bundesliga club back to
the first division.
	   The firing came after three consecutive defeats, but Ehrmantraut
was also involved in a well-publicized feud with sports director
Gernot Rohr and other club managers.
	   Ehrmantraut was told of his firing by club officials when he
showed up for the morning practice session and left the field in
tears.
	   ``The precarious situation in the standings and my criticism of
the board were the grounds for my firing,'' Ehrmantraut said.
	   Ehrmantraut became the sixth Bundesliga coach to be sacked or to
resign this season, and the third within a week.
	   The 42-year-old coach, who has a reputation for stubbornness and
modesty, took over at Eintracht two years ago, when the club was
languishing at the bottom of the second division.
	   Without hiring any stars, he built a compact squad of relatively
unknown players that played unspectacular but modestly successful
soccer. Eintracht was the first Bundesliga team to defeat Bayern
Munich this season, but Ehrmantraut had been under fire for his
defense-first attitude.
	   Eintracht is currently 14th in the 18-team league.
	   Assistant coach Berhard Lippert will guide the club in the final
two games before the winter break, during which Eintracht will
appoint a new head coach,

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Before firing his deputy for
immorality, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad called in a man who
alleged he was sodomized by the former No. 2 leader, Anwar Ibrahim,
a trial court was told Tuesday.
	   Azizan Abu Bakar testified at Anwar's corruption and sexual
misconduct trial that police asked him to go to Mahathir's Kuala
Lumpur residence late at night for a meeting which lasted more than
one hour.
	   But as the testimony continued, defense lawyers threatened to
launch proceedings against Azizan for allegedly lying about Anwar's
illegal sex acts.
	   ``The police told me that the prime minister wanted to know the
true story,'' said Azizan, a former employee of Anwar who alleged
the then-deputy prime minister repeatedly forced him into sodomy, a
crime in this predominantly Muslim nation.
	   The witness said he had told Mahathir during the Aug. 24 meeting
that the allegations against Anwar were true.
	   Anwar is on trial on four counts of abuse of power, and will be
tried later on another charge of corruption and five charges of
committing illegal sex acts.
	   He has denied any wrongdoing, calling the charges part of a
high-level conspiracy to ruin his political career.
	   Mahathir fired Anwar on Sept. 2, saying he had determined Anwar
was morally unfit for office. The sacking led to demands for
political reforms and massive anti-government protests in the
normally placid Southeast Asian capital.
	   Soon after Anwar was dismissed, Mahathir told reporters he had
personally spoken to many people with whom Anwar was alleged to
have illegal sex so that he could gauge the accusations for
himself.
	   But he had not disclosed details of such meetings.
	   Azizan, a former driver for Anwar's wife, startled the court
Monday by agreeing with a defense lawyer who said Anwar had never
sodomized him.
	   But as the cross-examination continued Tuesday defense lawyers
did not press him on the retraction.
	   It was not clear whether Azizan had gone back on his testimony
or he had simply misunderstood the defense lawyer's question.
	   On Tuesday, a defense lawyer said he was going to ask the court
to disregard Azizan's entire testimony on grounds that he was
telling lies.
	   ``We wish to institute impeachment proceedings against Azizan,''
Gurbachan Singh, the lawyer, told the trial judge, Augustine Paul.
	   If impeachment proceedings are permitted, the defense team is
expected to bring its own witnesses to testify against Azizan in an
attempt to prove he is lying about being sodomized by Anwar.
	   Azizan had accused Anwar of forcing him into sodomy in 1992. He
told the court last week that shame and guilt kept him from making
Anwar's repeated homosexual acts public until 1997.
	   Before the court adjourned for the day, Judge Augustine Paul
told defense lawyers that any impeachment proceedings against the
prosecution's chief witness, Azizan, would have to wait until
prosecutors have wrapped up their case against Anwar.
	   He added, however, that both the prosecution and defense should
prepare their respective submissions on the matter.
	   Defense lawyer Gurbachan Singh told the court he planned
conclude his cross-examination of Azizan on Wednesday.

Russian companies buy 107 million barrels of Iraqi oil
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS Aziz comments in grafs 7-8.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian oil companies bought more than one-third
of the oil that Iraq sold over the past six months under its
oil-for-food program with the United Nations, a news report said
Tuesday.
	   The purchases by the 13 Russian oil companies, including
powerhouses Sidanko and Lukoil, totaled 107 million barrels worth
dlrs 1.25 billion, or 35 percent of all Iraqi oil sold abroad, the
Interfax news agency said.
	   Iraq is under comprehensive U.N. sanctions, but is allowed to
export limited quantities of oil to buy food and medicine.
	   Russia is one of the world's largest oil producers and
exporters. But its oil companies have been buying Iraqi oil because
they want to maintain close ties and hope to rebuilding Iraq's oil
industry when United Nations sanctions are lifted.
	   However, the United States continues to support sanctions
against Iraq and says the Arab nations continues to conceal its
weapons program from U.N. inspectors.
	   The sanctions, imposed in response to Iraq's 1990 invasion of
Kuwait, are to remain until the inspectors certify that Iraq has
dismantled its program for making weapons of mass destruction.
	   Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz is currently visiting
Russia. Moscow has called for a ``comprehensive review'' of Iraq's
compliance with United Nations resolutions, saying this should help
wrap up seven years of U.N. weapons inspections.
	   Aziz, meeting with teachers and students at Moscow's Institute
of International Relations on Tuesday, stressed the two countries
have strong economic, political and cultural ties.
	   ``We have common objectives and common interests,'' Aziz said,
according to the ITAR-Tass news agency. ``Let us preserve, expand,
and strengthen them.''
	   Iraq agreed to resume cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors
last month after a confrontation that nearly led to military
strikes by the United States.

State-run radio says U.S. decision on drugs meaningless
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A commentary on Iranian radio Tuesday said
U.S. President Bill Clinton's decision to remove Iran from its list
of main drug-producing countries was meaningless.
	   It was Tehran's first response to Clinton's announcement on
Monday that he was removing Iran from a list of drug-problem
countries.
	   ``Whether the name of Iran is included or not included in the
annual list of the American government will not remove anything or
add anything to the reality of Iran's campaign against
international drug smuggling,'' said the commentary on state-run
Tehran Radio.
	   After Clinton's announcement, officials in Washington said the
decision was not political but reflected actual changes in Iran.
	   Still, the radio commentary questioned the Americans' motives.
	   ``Is the decision by the U.S. government a political measure to
reduce tension between the two countries?'' the commentator asked.
``Or is it that the White House has simply succumbed to ... Iran's
successful campaign to curb the production and transfer of
narcotics?''
	   Clinton said in a letter to Congress that Iran is no longer a
significant producer of opium poppy and has ceased to be a major
transit point for U.S.-bound illicit drugs.
	   Malaysia also was removed from the list based on findings that
only a negligible amount of U.S.-bound drugs was coming from that
country.
	   Clinton has been attempting to reach out to Iran, hoping to
establish a government-to-government dialogue for the first time in
two decades. But Iran has shown little interest.
	   Iran's Supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said a month ago
that the United States is intent on ``total domination'' of Iran
and that keeping relations severed was in Iran's interest.
	   The United States broke relations with Iran after Muslim
militants seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran during the 1979 Islamic
Revolution.
	   Iran has been cracking down on drug smugglers since 1988.
Hundreds of traffickers have been hanged under a law that mandates
the death penalty for anyone caught with more than a small quantity
of narcotics.
	   Large drug hauls are common in Iran, which lies on a route used
by smugglers to get drugs from Pakistan and Afghanistan to Europe
and the oil-rich Gulf.
	   Tehran also ran an energetic campaign to rid the country of
opium poppy, the raw material for heroin.

National Front member calls for Le Pen-Megret rapprochement
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS comments from National Front leader, Jean-Yves Le Gallou
and ousted member Serge Martinez.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A leading National Front member called on Tuesday
for a meeting of the far-right party in order to iron out
differences between Jean-Marie Le Pen and Bruno Megret, the party's
two battling leaders.
	   ``Party members, elected officials and activists want to be
heard and they very much want to see a Le Pen-Megret ticket,'' said
Jean-Yves Le Gallou, a regional National Front leader in the Paris
area who is close to Megret.
	   Meanwhile, conservative politicians from the traditional right
expressed satisfaction with the crisis that is pitting Le Pen
against Megret, his longtime lieutenant.
	   Gilles de Robien, a conservative member of parliament, told LCI
television he applauded the ``weakening of an extremist party that
has no business in a democracy.''
	   ``What is happening at the National Front is the destiny of all
authoritarian parties, where there is no internal democracy,'' said
de Robien, a member of the the Union for French Democracy party.
	   The brewing rivalry between Le Pen and Megret burst onto the
surface this weekend.
	   In the clearest sign of serious trouble in the party, one of Le
Pen's loyalists openly defied him on Monday _ and was immediately
fired. Three other firings followed, in what amounted to a purge of
party members close to Megret.
	   Serge Martinez, a longtime Le Pen loyalist who was one of those
dismissed Monday from his functions, said Tuesday he wanted to
remain a member of the far-right party.
	   ``It is clear that a number of National Front members have lost
their reason,'' Martinez said.
	   ``We don't want to be pushed out without being able to react,''
he told France Inter radio.
	   Meanwhile, Philippe Seguin, the head of French President Jacques
Chirac's Rally for the Republic party, said he sees no difference
between Le Pen and Megret.
	   ``Le Pen et Megret share the same ideology,'' Seguin was quoted
as saying in the daily Le Parisien. ``For my part, I cannot tell
the difference between the two.''
	   Megret has called a news conference for Wednesday to respond to
the growing controversy.
	   The anti-immigrant party has been widely accused of racism and
anti-Semitism.

China, Qatar win in soccer; Iran stunned by Oman
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with later games &QL; 
 &UR; By PATRICK MCDOWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Humiliating own goals by Iran and
Tajikistan fueled their defeats Tuesday in second-round Asian Games
soccer Tuesday, with Oman and China posting victories.
	   China beat Tajikistan 3-1, while the fancied Iranian side fell
in a stunning upset to Gulf rival Oman, 4-2, in Group 3.
	   Qatar beat Lebanon 1-0, and Thailand and Kazakstan played to a
1-1 draw in Group 4.
	   Fielding a squad of World Cup veterans and favored to win the
Asian Games gold, Iran now faces unexpected pressure to defeat
Tajikistan and China to ensure it will reach the quarterfinals.
	   Oman's Brazilian coach Valdeir Vieira acknowledged that Iran had
a stronger team and said his players played above themselves to
win.
	   ``If you asked me if we played Iran 10 more times, I don't think
we could win like that again,'' said Vieira, who until last year
was Iran's coach.
	   ``Iran is a better team than we are. We joined our two attackers
together and had better teamwork. This is not a team for today but
a team for two years from now,'' he said.
	   Earlier, Tajikistan captain Takhirdjon Muminov put a comeback
for his outclassed squad out of reach when a 15-meter shot by
Chinese substitute Huang Yong glanced off his shin for an own goal,
putting China ahead 3-1.
	   Barely an hour later, the highly partisan crowd at the national
stadium was horrified by the day's second own goal when Iran's
Mohammad Khani Nader dribbled a slow, routine pass back to the
keeper, who wasn't expecting it.
	   Bezhad Shahani Gholampour was too slow to keep the ball from
creeping into the net and the bungle ended the half 2-1 in Oman's
favor.
	   Bayern Munich star Ali Daei had opened the scoring in the 20th
minute for Iran but Oman's Mohamed Zayid quickly equalized.
	   The flag-waving pro-Iran crowd screamed in disbelief when Hani
al-Dhabit beat two defenders and punched the ball into the top far
corner shortly into the second half.
	   Daei, who attacked relentlessly, brought the Iranian side back
into competition with a cross to Vahid Hashemian Korbe, who headed
it in to make it 3-2.
	   Though the ball was in the Iranian end most of the half, Salim
Radhwan scored the match's final goal in the last minute with an
8-meter shot to make it 4-2.
	   Four Oman players were carried off on stretchers in the physical
match.
	   China dominated Tajikistan from the start. Combining with short
passes and with a sharp offense led by Yao Xia, they exploited the
weak right side.
	   In the 10th minute Yao broke loose from midfield and passed to
Zhao Junzhe, who took a clear shot from eight meters for the only
first-half goal.
	   Tajikistan clawed back in the second half. In the 53rd minute,
Suthbo Thamiedv drilled a 15-meter shot at a tight angle that
keeper Jang Jin couldn't control. Rustam Zabirov finished from
point-blank range to equalize.
	   But China quickly went back ahead when a long, lofty cross by Ma
found the head of Li Junyu, who bounded the ball slowly into the
net to make it 2-1.
	   Then came the decisive own goal.
	   China's English coach Bobby Houghton is concerned about his game
on Saturday against Iran after playing Oman on Thursday.
	   The top two teams of each of the four groups advance to the
quarterfinals.
	   ``I think it is a fairly even group but I think Iran is probably
the favorite of the tournament because they brought a World Cup
side here. We have an Olympic side,'' Houghton said. ``We will
probably have a real challenge with Iran.''
	   In the other afternoon game, Qatar defeated Lebanon 1-0 with a
straight shot from the top of the penalty box by Abdul Karim Dad
just 10 minutes into the game.
	   After that, the play went back and forth without too much
opportunity to increase the scoring. Lebanon managed just four
shots on goal.
	   Qatar meets Kazakstan on Thursday and eventually host Thailand.
	   The match with Thailand is expected to attract extra excitement
among Thai fans as players from the two countries had engaged in an
all-out brawl in a so-called friendly match just days before the
start of the games.
	   Thailand's hopes were helped with its draw against Kazakstan.
	   A free kick by Dusit Chalermsan put Thailand ahead shortly into
the second half before a crowd of more than 50,000.
	   Thailand's Kiatsiuk Senamuang was brought down with a hard
tackle to give the hosts a free kick about 25 meters from the goal.
	   Dusit's shot went over the wall of defenders and curved into the
top right side of the net, beating a diving Kazak goalie Oleg
Voskoboinikov.
	   With 15 minutes left in the game, Viktor Zubarev tied it for
Kazakstan.

Kosovo rebels reject U.S. peace draft
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with KLA spokesman rejecting U.S. plan, suggesting
Hill should be replaced; Human Rights Watch statement.
 &UR; By KATARINA KRATOVAC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The chief spokesman for Kosovo
Albanian rebels rejected the latest peace plan for the troubled
province Tuesday, and called for the removal of its American
architect for alleged pro-Serb bias.
	   Adem Demaci also acknowledged that the rebel Kosovo Liberation
Army was using lull in the Kosovo fighting to arm itself and
prepare for more battles with government troops.
	   ``The KLA has no illusion that the (Serb) regime will overnight
democratize and that it will give up trying to find a solution of
the Kosovo crisis with force,'' Demaci told reporters. ``It would
be dangerous if the Albanians don't continue arming themselves and
preparing for resistance.''
	   Demaci said that the latest peace plan drafted by the U.S. envoy
for Kosovo, Christopher Hill, is ``fully unacceptable'' primarily
because it doesn't envisage what will happen to the KLA if it was
adopted.
	   ``Mr. Hill either doesn't understand the Albanian problems, or
he is leaning toward the Serbs,'' Demaci said, adding: ``The State
Department should reconsider the results of his work'' and ``send
us more qualified people.''
	   On Monday, the chief negotiator of the more moderate Albanian
faction in Kosovo also rejected the draft, but the United States
pledged to keep working on a formula for a political solution in
Kosovo.
	   The negotiator, Fehmi Agani said the draft was ``unacceptable''
because it was too close to the views of Serbia. Kosovo is a
province of Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia. Serbia refuses
to consider any Kosovo plan that would substantially reduce its
control over the ethnic Albanian-majority province.
	   Hundreds were killed and almost 300,000 ethnic Albanians
displaced in a seven-month crackdown by Serbian forces against
Kosovo's separatists, before an October peace agreement brought
about a tentative truce.
	   More than 1,000 Kosovo Albanians are believed to be in Serbian
prisons and police stations, and at least five have died from
beatings and torture, the U.S.-based Human Rights Watch said
Tuesday.
	   ``Five individuals are known to have died in detention since
July 1998 from the violence inflicted on them by the police prison
guards,'' said a Human Rights Watch statement.
	   The statement, faxed to The Associated Press bureau in Belgrade,
said hundreds of others have been injured from beatings and
torture, often used to extract confessions.
	   Most ethnic Albanians want independence or substantial
self-rule, whereas Serbia, in its proposal for Kosovo released last
month, has offered only a degree of autonomy while keeping the
province firmly under Serbian control.
	   Washington, however, opposes full independence, fearing that
would lead to similar demands by other ethnic Albanian communities
elsewhere in the southern Balkans.
	   That in turn could destabilize what has historically been one of
Europe's most unstable regions.
	   Although fighting has all but ceased since the October accord,
there are fears that Kosovo will again explode unless a political
solution is found by spring.
	   Ivan Sedlak, an official on the Serbian negotiating team, said
the latest version of Hill's plan has not been studied by the
Serbian government. He said the previous U.S. version was
unacceptable because it defined Kosovo virtually as a separate
state.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ AT and T Corp. is buying IBM's data networking
business for dlrs 5 billion cash, filling an important gap in AT
and T's ability to supply business customers with high-speed data
services and Internet access.
	   International Business Machines Corp.'s Global Network Business,
with dlrs 2.5 billion in revenue, has 1 million Internet users as
well as tens of thousand of business customers in the U.S. and
abroad. Companies use the network to link computers that are far
apart, to accept orders from customers and to connect to the
Internet.
	   Under the deal announced Tuesday, 5,000 IBM employees from the
global network division will go to work for AT and T when the deal
closes. The deal is expected to be concluded within six months or
so.
	   In a related move, IBM agreed to manage AT and T's computers
that support its long-distance services for business customers for
dlrs 4 billion over 10 years. As a result, more than 2,000 AT and T
employees will be offered jobs at IBM.
	   In addition, AT and T will manage the communications needed by
IBM for its business customers for dlrs 5 billion over five years.
	   Tuesday's deal, which has been rumored for months, aids AT and
T's goal to become a dominant provider of communications that use
Internet technology to transmit data. In addition to giving AT and
T a strong presence in the United States, the deal bolsters AT and
T's joint venture with British Telecom, announced earlier this
year, which aims to supply communications services to business
customers across different nations.
	   For IBM, the sale enables it to focus on its strengths in
selling computers and computer services.
	   IBM's network grew from a phone system linking its outposts into
one of the world's largest communications systems. It transmits
corporate data for about 30,000 customers in 50 countries.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Somersaulting, jumping and vaulting in
a league of their own, China's teen-age women gymnasts captured
team gold Tuesday at the Asian Games, giving China its seventh
consecutive sweep of both the men and women's team events.
	   Japan captured silver, bettering the bronze clinched by the
men's team in its close battle with South Korea on Monday.
Kazakstan won bronze, edging out Uzbekistan by less than half a
point.
	   But it was the Chinese in their bright yellow and red outfits
who stole the evening. After just two of the four disciplines, the
Chinese had opened a four-point gap over the Japanese and were
already giving each other high fives.
	   By the end of the competition, the gap was more than seven
points.
	   Four members of China's squad had captured team bronze at last
year's World Championships, but the newcomers were impressive too.
	   Xu Jing, a shy 16-year-old who has been with the team just six
months, scored 9.8 with a nearly flawless display of soaring
somersaults and grace on the floor.
	   Ling Jie, another 16-year-old in just her second major
competition, broke into a beaming smile after an excellent uneven
bars routine that scored 9.825. She was also the night's leading
scorer, heading a Chinese 1-2-3 at the top of the individual
standings.
	   Veteran Liu Xuan, the team's oldest member at 19, also was
delighted after an almost flawless routine on the balance beam that
finished with a soaring double somersault and scored 9.85.
	   ``No problem there,'' said Qian Kui, the head coach. ``She
didn't wobble.''
	   The team's strong performance cleared the way for the
possibility of more medals for China in the individual
competitions. The top 24 gymnasts qualify for Wednesday's contest
to find the best all-around gymnast, and the top eight in each
discipline also qualify for apparatus finals Thursday.
	   China's women won all six gymnastics gold medals at the last
Asian Games in Hiroshima, Japan, in 1994. The men and women have
also won every team event since 1974.
	   North Korea, back in the Asian Games after skipping 1994,
fielded a team including some members who looked underage.
	   Coaches, doctors and officials questioned whether some of the
tiny North Korean girls, who urged each other on with high-pitched
squeals, had reached the regulation age of 16.
	   ``They look noticeably young,'' said Jackie Fie, an official
from the sport's governing body, the FIG. ``They look 11.''
	   ``Not yet,'' she replied when asked whether any of the other
teams had complained. North Korea was once banned from a World
Championships after officials discovered age discrepancies with
some its gymnasts, she said.
	   A North Korean coach and gymnasts refused to answer reporters'
questions. The team finished fifth, ahead of last-place Thailand.
	   South Korea's women won team bronze in 1994, but they did not
field a full squad at these games because four gymnasts tested
positive for banned substances ahead of the competition, a South
Korean coach said.

	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Mathias Fredriksson knocked out his brother
Thobias in the semifinal round on his way to victory in a ski cross
country sprint event Tuesday which vaulted him atop the World Cup
standings.
	   The first ever victory in the yearly competition gave the
25-year-old Swede 150 points and the overall lead after two races.
	   Fredriksson had placed fourth in the season opener at Muonio,
Finland, a 10-kilometer freestyle race won by his teammate Per
Olofsson last month.
	   Olofsson was eliminated in the very first round at the Milan
meet.
	   Fredriksson won the two-way sprint final against Peter
Schlickenrieder when his German opponent took the wrong way in the
next-to-last of four laps while surprisingly leading the favored
Swede.
	   Also the women's final, won by Norway's Anita Moen-Guidon, was
decided by a mishap.
	   Slovenian Andreja Mali fell a few meters from the finish line,
while trying to fight off the strong comeback of the Norwegian
skier.
	   Italian favorite Stefania Belmondo fell and was eliminated in
the first round of sprints.
	   Thobias Fredriksson, who lost the semifinal following a
shoulder-to-shoulder duel with his brother, still earned the podium
by beating Norway's Odd-Bjorn Hjelmeset for third place.
	   Another Norwegian, Tor Arne Hetland, placed fifth ahead of Ari
Pololahti, the Finnish winner of the Milan sprint race last year.
	   Pololahti was also victim of a mistake when he headed toward the
finish line one lap too soon.
	   The sprint races were held at an indoor area usually hosting the
Milan ready-to-wear fashion shows in spring and autumn.
	   Skiers competed on artificial snow over four laps, for a
distance of one kilometer.
	   Mathias Fredriksson said he was surprised with his victory and
with his semifinal success against his brother.
	   ``Normally Thobias is faster in sprints ... In this kind of race
you must be lucky to start in front and take good turns,'' he said.
	   The Swedish skier added things may change quickly atop the World
Cup standings, beginning with the next races scheduled at Toblach
(Dobbiaco), Italy, this weekend.
	   Tuesday's victory, also a first for Moen-Guidon, gave the
Norwegian skier second place in the women's overall standings at
114 points, behind Katerina Neumannova.
	   Neumannova, a Czech, piled up 140 points from a victory in
Muonio and fourth place in Tuesday's sprint.
	   Moen-Guidon said she was lucky to win.
	   ``When I saw her falling I was happy to be first ... I always
thought it was not finished before the line,'' Moen-Guidon said.
	   Tuesday's sprints were deserted by Russian athletes and by
Norwegian great Bjorn Dahlie.

</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Albright quotes, EDITS to conform &QL; 
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright said Tuesday that updating NATO's strategic concept, the
alliance's guiding military and political principles, is not as
critics contend an attempt to create a new ``global NATO'' far
beyond the intent of the original treaty.
	   Foreign ministers from the 16-nation alliance met here to lay
the groundwork for the 50th anniversary NATO summit in April in
Washington, where leaders are expected to approve the alliance's
strategy for the 21st century.
	   Today's threat is no longer a Russian tank assault across the
plains of Central Europe, but challenges from regional conflicts
like Bosnia and Kosovo, terrorism and the spread of weapons of mass
destruction. When these threats originate from outside NATO's
traditional territory of operations, the alliance must be prepared
to deal with them.
	   In practice, NATO has already adjusted to these new realities,
intervening in Bosnia, halting the humanitarian disaster in Kosovo
with the threat of air strikes, sending soldiers just across the
Kosovo border in Macedonia to rescue civilian cease-fire monitors
if needed.
	   ``We must be prepared because we know that events beyond NATO's
immediate borders can affect vital alliance interests,'' Albright
said. ``Common sense tells us that it is sometimes better to deal
with instability when it is still at arms length than to wait until
it is at our doorstep.''
	   NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said thinking beyond NATO's
traditional territory is nothing new. ``NATO is already acting out
of area, so let's not dramatize that,'' he said.
	   Albright responded to suggestions that assuming new missions
beyond collective European defense is tinkering with the original
North Atlantic Treaty: ``I've said it before; I will repeat it
again today: This is hogwash.''
	   ``I often remind people that a ballistic missile attack using a
weapon of mass destruction from a rogue state is every bit as much
a ... threat to our borders now as a Warsaw Pact tank was two
decades ago,'' she said.
	   German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer said adapting to change
has always been one of NATO's strong points.
	   ``One of the special qualities of the alliance has always been
its ability to react flexibly to new situations,'' he said. ``On
the eve of the 21st century we should ask ourselves if our
instruments still match the changed security environment.''
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook stressed the increased role
Europeans want to play in continental security, particularly in
cases where the United States is less interested in participating.
NATO is developing a policy it calls the European Security and
Defense Identity to deal with that, but France and Britain are
pressing for the European Union to play a role too.
	   ``The focus must be strengthening and improving the European
security identity,'' Cook said, stressing nonetheless that ``NATO
will remain the basis for territorial defense for the EU.''
	   Solana said the EU, Europe's economic alliance, is changing and
NATO's plans must be adapted to the changes in the EU. ``We are
trying to reconcile these things.''
	   Albright proposed setting up a Center for Weapons of Mass
Destruction, essentially on how to best share and use intelligence.
The plan would use existing NATO headquarters staff under one
director, with perhaps a few extra experts.
	   The Germans planned to bring up the nuclear first-strike
question later in the meeting.
	   Fischer made waves when he called on NATO last month to consider
dropping its doctrine allowing a nuclear first-strike. This
doctrine, reaffirmed as recently as last year, has always been a
part of NATO's nuclear strategy and is considered an important
aspect of deterrence.
	   ``The minister will certainly raise the issue,'' a German
diplomatic source said. ``We have to see that in the context of
arms control, arms reduction and nonproliferation.''
	   The Germans don't have much backing on the issue, however.
	   The allies assessed the situation in Kosovo, where Serb security
forces and ethnic Albanian guerrillas clashed for seven months. The
threat of a NATO air strike stopped the fighting in October and the
cease-fire is generally holding, while American mediator
Christopher Hill attempts to firm the peace with political
agreement.
	   ``Kosovo is a critical test not only for NATO, but for Europe's
larger security structure,'' Albright said.
	   The ministers also made their six-monthly review of the
situation in Bosnia. No major reduction in the 32,000-troop level
in the NATO-led peacekeeping force is expected soon.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A day after reshuffling his top staff, President
Boris Yeltsin remained hospitalized and out of sight Tuesday.
	   The often ailing president, apparently tired of being seen as
little more than a figurehead, roused himself from his sickbed for
three hours Monday and dismissed several aides, included some who
had commented recently on Yeltsin's weakened health.
	   But he continued to keep his distance from Russia's pressing
economic problems. The Russian economy slumped earlier this year,
partly in response to Asia's economic travails, and plummeted after
Aug. 17, when the government devalued the ruble and temporarily
froze foreign debt payments.
	   Yeltsin fired almost his entire cabinet as a result of that
decision.
	   Presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said doctors allowed the
president to take brief walks around the hospital grounds Tuesday
for the first time since he was hospitalized with pneumonia on Nov.
22.
	   ``That means he is on the way to recovery,'' Yakushkin was
quoted as saying by the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Yakushkin said Yeltsin was working on documents, but had no
meetings planned and would remain hospitalized as long as necessary
to recuperate.
	   ``Pneumonia is an illness that requires a serious treatment and
a certain regime,'' he said.
	   Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov said Yeltsin's reshuffle
made no real difference for the running of the country.
	   ``He is not governing anything any longer,'' Zyuganov said of
Yeltsin. ``This is simply an agony.''
	   Yeltsin sacked his presidential chief of staff Valentin
Yumashev, and three of Yumashev's deputies. A former journalist who
was the ghost-writer of Yeltsin's memoirs, Yumashev had served as
chief of staff for nearly two years _ a lengthy stay in Yeltsin's
Kremlin.
	   Gen. Nikolai Bordyuzha, 49, the secretary of the presidential
security council, was appointed the new chief of staff. Bordyuzha,
who will serve in both posts, immediately called for tackling
corruption.
	   The Kremlin shakeup dominated Tuesday's headlines in all major
Russian newspapers, many of whom said the move would energize the
presidential staff.
	   ``Yeltsin has broken away from the doctors' watch and again
shown he won't let anyone bury him,'' the liberal daily Segodnya
said.
	   Yakushkin, the president's spokesman, said Yeltsin dismissed the
aides because of their failure to stem crime and respond to several
incidents of political extremism, including anti-Semitic remarks by
a Communist parliament deputy.
	   However, the aides were primarily responsible for organizing
Yeltsin's work and handling administrative affairs inside the
Kremlin, not with issues such as fighting crime.
	   The ousters were thought to reflect Yeltsin's unhappiness over
the aides' candid remarks about the president's health. Yumashev
and others in the Kremlin have openly said that Yeltsin's ailments
left him too weak to handle day-to-day affairs.
	   ``In a situation when the presidential inner circle starts
speaking about the boss as if he were a political outsider, you
have to replace either the president, or his aides,'' the business
daily Kommersant said Tuesday. ``Yeltsin has chosen the second.''
	   Yeltsin has said and done little since the economy went into a
tailspin in August, leaving Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov to
tackle the crisis. But the president insists he will carry out his
term until it ends in 2000.

Blair calls for deeper business relationship with China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prime Minister Tony Blair called Tuesday for a
close trading alliance between Britain and China, and said that
Britain should aim to become the country's major business partner
in Europe.
	   ``I believe China is ripe for British investment,'' Blair said,
addressing the China-Britain Business Council. ``Our aim is very
clear. It is nothing less than to make Britain China's number one
business partner in Europe for both trade and investment.''
	   Blair, who visited China in October, also promised he would
personally help businessmen win contracts in China _ contradicting
his International Development Secretary, Clare Short, who on Sunday
said that she had refused to promote British export deals.
	   Brushing aside criticism from businessmen and the opposition
Conservative Party, Short, who oversees Britain's international aid
program, said Monday that she was right not to use her office to
promote trade during an October visit to China, instead raising
human rights issues.
	   Blair said Britain's 1997 handover of Hong Kong to China enabled
the two countries to ``build a new relationship unhindered by the
legacy of history.'' Throughout the 1990s, Britain's relationship
with China was damaged by wrangling over the future of the British
colony.
	   Blair said he would continue to press Chinese leaders about
human rights, adding that criticisms would be more productive if
delivered ``in the context of a warm relationship.''
	   ``We can be constructive as well as fully engage in dialogue at
all levels while maintaining an atmosphere of mutual respect,''
Blair said.

Russian archbishop stabbed by burglar
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The archbishop of the southern Russian region of
Tatarstan was stabbed in the face by a burglar after trying to
chase him down, a news report said Tuesday.
	   Archbishop Anastasy and his assistant, who was stabbed in the
arm, were hospitalized in Kazan, Tatarstan's capital.
	   The two priests heard someone fiddling with the lock on their
house late Monday. They opened the door and confronted the burglar,
and he ran off, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Anastasy and his assistant tried to chase him, but he turned
around and stabbed them with a knife, the report said.
	   The suspect has been detained. He told police he had lost his
way and knocked at the archbishop's door to ask directions.

Russian archbishop stabbed by burglar
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The archbishop of the southern Russian region of
Tatarstan was stabbed in the face by a burglar after trying to
chase him down, a news report said Tuesday.
	   Archbishop Anastasy and his assistant, who was stabbed in the
arm, were hospitalized in Kazan, Tatarstan's capital.
	   The two priests heard someone fiddling with the lock on their
house late Monday. They opened the door and confronted the burglar,
and he ran off, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Anastasy and his assistant tried to chase him, but he turned
around and stabbed them with a knife, the report said.
	   The suspect has been detained. He told police he had lost his
way and knocked at the archbishop's door to ask directions.

Lots of Swissair cash recovered, but no diamonds
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ Most of the cash aboard Swissair
Flight 111 has been found, but the plane's stash of diamonds has
still not been retrieved from the ocean floor.
	   As of last week, the scallop dragger dredging the crash site was
still finding a substantial amount of debris and currency, RCMP
spokesman Sgt. Bill Price said Monday.
	   He said the cash, most of it American, is being found in bits
and pieces.
	   Swissair has said 50 kilograms (110 pounds) of cash was on board
when the MD-11, headed from New York to Geneva, crashed off Peggy's
Cove on Sept. 2. All 229 people aboard were killed.
	   ``Whether it was hundreds of thousands (of dollars) or whether
it was millions, I don't really know,'' said Price, adding the
recovered money is being dried in a special building at Canadian
Forces Base Shearwater before being turned over to Swissair.
	   The kilogram (2 pounds) of diamonds _ the weight includes
packaging _ has been more elusive.
	   ``Heavens knows where they are,'' said Price. ``We may never see
it again, it's hard to say.''
	   The precious gems investigators said they found earlier this
fall were personal effects, he said.
	   Swissair has said the container holding the cash and jewels was
not shockproof and may have been damaged by the crash impact.
	   About 85 per cent of the plane has been recovered. Half of the
cockpit has been hauled up.
	   By Monday, the remains of at least 223 victims had been
identified.

 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   --
	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ South Africa will coordinate a
fact-finding mission to the Comoros Islands, where clashes by
secessionists on the island of Anjouan led to several deaths over
the weekend.
	   The South African foreign ministry said Tuesday the mission
would take place Wednesday through Friday and be conducted under
the auspicies of the Organization of African Unity.
	   The mission will include one representative each from the
governments of South Africa, Madagascar, Mauritius, Mozambique,
Kenya and Tanzania.
	   Since the islands of Anjouan and Moheli declared unilateral
independence from the Federal Islamic Republic of the Comoros in
August last year, the OAU has urged all parties to resolve their
dispute peacefully.
	   --
	   MBABANE, Swaziland (AP) _ Two of nine prisoners awaiting trial
for the killing of a South African taxi driver have died in prison
in Swaziland, prison authorities said Tuesday.
	   The authorities, in a report by the South African Press
Association, would not give any further details about the deaths
but said the other seven co-accused were in good health.
	   Taxi driver Michael Khoza was murdered in a mob attack in August
after he accidentally knocked down and killed a 16-year-old Swazi
girl in northern Swaziland.

Euro bank chief: no risk of deflation despite slower growth
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL AMES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ European Central Bank President Wim
Duisenberg said Tuesday he saw no risk of deflation for the
European economy despite the expected slowdown of growth next year.
	   Duisenberg gave a generally sober assessment of the economic
situation in the 11 nations that adopt the euro as their common
currency on Jan. 1.
	   ``The risks are on the downside. Every single figure that
becomes available confirms that more and more,'' Duisenberg told a
European Parliament committee.
	   He said inflation was under control in the euro-zone. Although
the bank projected a rise from 1.2 percent to 1.6 percent next
year, he saw no danger of price increases exceeding the ECB's upper
limit of 2 percent.
	   Duisenberg said the threat of deflation, or falling prices,
brought about by an economic slump, was ``as much as an evil as
inflation,'' but he added ``at this time, there is no danger of
deflation.''
	   He forecast growth across the 11-nation bloc would slip to 2.4
percent next year, compared to 2.8 in 1998. Although a recovery is
predicted in 2000, Duisenberg said ``the uncertainties are too
great and the risks too large to attach too much importance to
that.''
	   Sluggish growth means, the euro-zone's persistently high
unemployment will dip only ``marginally'' from 11.8 percent to 11.2
in 1999, he said.
	   Duisenberg chastised euro-zone nations for not loosening rigid
labor market rules to help create jobs.
	   ``If governments really want to bring down their unemployment
rate, they must be willing to contribute to reform ... of markets,
particularly labor markets.''
	   He also expressed concern that euro-zone governments for not
striving hard enough to balance budgets.
	   Duisenberg reiterated the ECB plan to keep the key euro-zone
interest rate at the current 3 percent level for ``the foreseeable
future.'' He said sticking to the rate set last week by all the
euro-zone nations, expect Italy, will reduce market uncertainty.
	   ``We intend to keep them there for the foreseeable future ... to
give markets a sense of continuity and stability,'' he said.
However he added, ``how far we can foresee, I cannot tell you.''
	   On relations between the euro and the dollar, Duisenberg said he
was pleased with the recent lack of major exchange-rate swings and
expressed hope stability would continue after the euro's launch.
	   ``Volatility has been rather subdued, which I think is good for
the European and the U.S. economies.''

Africa's southernmost point to be a national park
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ For years it has been Africa's
most unusual address and the holiday home of a bricklayer.
	   Now barren and windswept Cape Agulhas, the African continent's
southernmost tip, will be converted into a national park, South
African National Parks said on Tuesday.
	   Cape Agulhas, marked by a solitary lighthouse and scattered
cottages, has long been a tourist trap, attracting 80,000 visitors
a year to a point where the next land south is in Antarctica.
	   For decades tourists assumed the lighthouse marked the spot, but
in 1986, when officials decided to erect a beacon, surveyors
discovered the southernmost tip in fact lay in the grounds of a
neighboring bricklayer's cottage.
	   Now Koos Malan, who used the site for holidays, has abandoned
plans to erect a restaurant and curio shop and sold the property
for 1.8 million rand (dlrs 300,000) to the parks authority, which
will conserve the land.
	   Plans are also afoot to lease the area surrounding the
lighthouse to create a 2,000 hectare (4,940-acre) national park by
March 1. Eventually up to 20,000 hectares (49,400 acres) of nearby
land could be purchased in the area, which is home to rare plant
and bird life.
	   One of the first acts of the new park will be to bulldoze the
grey brick cottage, but its former owner is unlikely to protest.
	   ``They can do whatever they like with it and I wish them luck,''
Malan told the Cape Times newspaper ``I still don't like the place
and I've never liked the house. The only thing right about that
place was the address.''

FIS moves postponed men's downhill to Italy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OBERHOFEN, Switzerland (AP) _ A men's downhill race wiped out by
fog at Whistler, Canada, will be held Dec. 18 in the Italian resort
of Val Gardena, the International Ski Federation announced Tuesday.
	   On Sunday, heavy fog at Whistler forced cancellation of the
World Cup race for the third straight day.
	   The rescheduled race will be followed Dec. 19 by another men's
downhill which was already scheduled for Val Gardena.
	   A decision will be taken Wednesday on rescheduling of a men's
super-giant slalom, also wiped out at Whistler, FIS said.
	   The Whistler event has been hit by three years of bad weather.

Japanese lower house approves third supplementary budget
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's lower house of Parliament approved a 5.676
trillion yen (dlrs 47.3 billion) supplementary budget Tuesday,
effectively enacting a spending measure designed to help jump start
the nation's moribund economy.
	   The extra budget, the third of its kind for the current fiscal
year, earmarks funds to finance part of the government's most
recent economic stimulus package, which totals a record 24 trillion
yen (dlrs 200 billion).
	   Backed by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, the budget passed
easily with a majority of lawmakers voting in favor of it. The LDP
controls 263 of the 500 seats in the House of Representatives.
	   The supplementary budget was sent to the upper house for
deliberation, but Tuesday's passage by the more-powerful lower
house meant the bill already effectively has become law.
	   The upper house was expected to approve the budget later this
week, but even if that chamber rejects the measure, it would
automatically be enacted in 20 days under laws giving the lower
house the final say on budgetary matters.
	   Japan originally passed a 77.67 trillion yen (dlrs 647 billion)
budget for fiscal 1998, which ends next March. An initial
supplementary budget approved in May allowed 4.6 trillion yen (dlrs
38 billion) in additional pending.
	   A second supplementary budget was passed in October guaranteeing
53 trillion yen (dlrs 441 billion) to stabilize Japan's shaky
financial system.

Chirac lunches with Dalai Lama despite Beijing's objections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INCORPORATES China-France-Dalai Lama

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ President Jacques Chirac lunched at his Elysee
Palace with the Dalai Lama on Tuesday despite China's calls on the
French government to cancel the invitation to the Tibetan spiritual
leader.
	   France defended its effort to host the Dalai Lama but also
affirmed Tibet should remain part of China.
	   The exiled leader's visit to Paris to participate in the 50th
anniversary celebration of the Universal Declaration of the Rights
of Man was ``natural,'' the French government said.
	   ``The Dalai Lama is a respected religious figure and respected
by the international community and the French people,'' Foreign
Ministry spokesman Francois Rivasseau told a daily news briefing
before the lunch.
	   ``France has always recognized that Tibet has been part of
China. That position is unchanged,'' he added.
	   Earlier Tuesday, Beijing pressed Chirac to drop his lunch plans
with the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize winner, one of a group of Nobel
laureates invited to meet Chirac at festivities.
	   ``We are opposed to a meeting by official figures in whatever
country with the Dalai Lama in whatever form,'' Chinese Foreign
Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao told a regular press briefing in
Beijing.
	   France has sought to avoid friction with China, in its effort to
expand commercial ties with China. Chirac's prime minister, Lionel
Jospin, visited Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong in September.
	   The Dalai Lama, who fled Tibet in 1959 after a failed uprising
against Chinese rule, has been campaigning for greater autonomy for
the Himalayan region.

National Front member calls for Le Pen-Megret rapprochement
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in grafs 3-5 with comments from Le Pen supporter,
son-in-law; deletes extraneous word in graf 15 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A leading National Front member called on Tuesday
for a meeting of the far-right party in order to iron out
differences between Jean-Marie Le Pen and Bruno Megret, the party's
two battling leaders.
	   ``Party members, elected officials and activists want to be
heard and they very much want to see a Le Pen-Megret ticket,'' said
Jean-Yves Le Gallou, a regional National Front leader in the Paris
area who is close to Megret.
	   But a top Le Pen deputy, who is also his son-in-law, sounded
much less conciliatory.
	   ``This is a maneuver to destabilize the National Front,'' said
Samuel Marechal, Le Pen's son-in-law and his deputy
secretary-general.
	   ``It is clear that some people are playing with fire.''
	   Not surprisingly, conservative politicians from the traditional
right expressed satisfaction with the crisis that is pitting Le Pen
against Megret, his longtime lieutenant.
	   Gilles de Robien, a conservative member of parliament, told LCI
television he applauded the ``weakening of an extremist party that
has no business in a democracy.''
	   ``What is happening at the National Front is the destiny of all
authoritarian parties, where there is no internal democracy,'' said
de Robien, a member of the the Union for French Democracy party.
	   The brewing rivalry between Le Pen and Megret burst onto the
surface this weekend.
	   In the clearest sign of serious trouble in the party, one of Le
Pen's loyalists openly defied him on Monday _ and was immediately
fired. Three other firings followed, in what amounted to a purge of
party members close to Megret.
	   Serge Martinez, a longtime Le Pen loyalist who was one of those
dismissed Monday from his functions, said Tuesday he wanted to
remain a member of the far-right party.
	   ``It is clear that a number of National Front members have lost
their reason,'' Martinez said.
	   ``We don't want to be pushed out without being able to react,''
he told France Inter radio.
	   Meanwhile, Philippe Seguin, the head of French President Jacques
Chirac's Rally for the Republic party, said he sees no difference
between Le Pen and Megret.
	   ``Le Pen and Megret share the same ideology,'' Seguin was quoted
as saying in the daily Le Parisien. ``For my part, I cannot tell
the difference between the two.''
	   Megret has called a news conference for Wednesday to respond to
the growing controversy.
	   The anti-immigrant party has been widely accused of racism and
anti-Semitism.

<TEXT>
	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ Chechen authorities found the decapitated
heads of four kidnapped foreigners Tuesday near a remote village
after a two-month search in the breakaway region in southern
Russia.
	   An Associated Press reporter saw the severed heads near the
village of Assinovskaya, about 40 kms (25 miles) west of Grozny,
the Chechen capital. He did not see any sign of the bodies.
	   The heads were identified as those of the four abducted
foreigners by Umar Makhauri, who had been a bodyguard assigned to
the four when they were abducted Oct. 3 by unidentified gunmen in
Grozny. He said the bodies had not been found.
	   But Chechen government officials at the scene said four bodies
had been found without giving further details. Chechen President
Aslan Maskhadov said in Grozny that the bodies of four men had been
recovered.
	   The hostages _ Britons Peter Kennedy, Darren Hickey, and Rudolf
Petschi, and New Zealand's Stanley Shaw _ were engineers. They were
working for Granger Telecom, a British telephone company,
installing 300,000 telephone lines across Chechnya.
	   Spokesmen at the British and New Zealand embassies in Moscow
said they were checking on reports the four men had been killed,
but could not comment. The British Foreign Ministry in London said
it was investigating urgently reports that bodies had been found.
	   A spokesman for Granger Telecom in Britain said, ``We have heard
the reports and are obviously investigating, but there is nothing
we can say at this stage.''
	   Chechen acting Firt Vice Premier Turpal Atgeriyev, who is
heading the investigation into the killings, said authorities had
several suspects in the abduction, but have failed to make any
progress, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Eamon Hickey, the father of one of the missing men, said he
heard the news and was hoping it would not be confirmed.
	   ``There is so much rumor and counter-rumor coming from out there
that we don't know what to think. Obviously we are hoping and
praying that it does not turn out to be true,'' he said at his home
in England.
	   Chechen authorities had been searching for the missing men for
the past two months. British officials said they had not received
any ransom demand for the missing men.
	   Maskhadov said the deaths of the four men were a major blow to
Chechnya and its efforts to gain international recognition of its
independence. He blamed the rash of abductions in Chechnya to
unidentified ``outside forces'' and their Chechen henchmen.
	   ``I am ready to answer before my people and the whole world for
what happened,'' he was quoted as saying by the Interfax news
agency.
	   Hostage-takings, usually for ransom, have become common in
Chechnya since the end of the breakaway republic's two-year war for
independence from Russia in 1996. But victims are rarely killed.
	   Since the beginning of 1998, 176 people have been kidnapped in
the North Caucasus region of Russia, including dozens of
foreigners, and 90 of them released, officials have said.

NATO ministers keep level of Bosnia force unchanged
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO foreign ministers agreed Tuesday
to leave NATO-led multinational peacekeeping force in Bosnia at its
current 32,000-troop level.
	   The Bosnia Stabilization Force ``cannot be maintained
indefinitely nor does it reduce the responsibility of the
authorities (in Bosnia) to ensure the stability of their country,''
the ministers said in a statement.
	   They also said one of the key tasks for 1999 would be to
accelerate the return of refugees to areas where they represent an
ethnic minority.
	   The return of refugees to their homes has been slow since the
three-year war ended in December 1995 with the signing of the
Dayton peace accord.
	   Many Bosnian Muslims returning to areas where they are a
minority have faced ethnic tensions. Often they find their houses
have been destroyed or that Serb families have moved in.
	   The statement said much had been achieved in rebuilding Bosnia
since the war. But there is ``still much to be done to reinforce
the fragile democracy taking root'' in the country, it added.
	   Areas that require particular effort are the establishment of
the rule of law, the development of common institutions for the
state, the fight against corruption, and ethnic integration.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Albright quotes, Solana quotes, Bosnia
and Kosovo reviews. No pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
said today that updating NATO's guiding military and political
principles is not _ as critics contend _ an attempt to create a
``global NATO'' far beyond the intent of the original treaty.
	   Foreign ministers from the 16-nation alliance met in Brussels to
lay the groundwork for the 50th anniversary NATO summit in April in
Washington, where leaders are expected to approve the alliance's
strategy for the 21st century.
	   Today's threat is no longer a Russian tank assault across the
plains of Central Europe, but challenges from regional conflicts
like Bosnia and Kosovo, terrorism and the spread of weapons of mass
destruction.
	   In practice, NATO already has adjusted to these new realities,
intervening in Bosnia, halting the humanitarian disaster in Kosovo
with the threat of air strikes, stationing soldiers in Macedonia to
rescue Kosovo cease-fire monitors if needed.
	   ``We must be prepared because we know that events beyond NATO's
immediate borders can affect vital alliance interests,'' Albright
said. ``Common sense tells us that it is sometimes better to deal
with instability when it is still at arms length than to wait until
it is at our doorstep.''
	   NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said thinking beyond NATO's
traditional territory is nothing new. ``NATO is already acting out
of area, so let's not dramatize that,'' he said.
	   Albright responded to suggestions that assuming new missions
beyond collective European defense is tinkering with the original
North Atlantic Treaty: ``I've said it before; I will repeat it
again today: This is hogwash.''
	   ``I often remind people that a ballistic missile attack using a
weapon of mass destruction from a rogue state is every bit as much
a ... threat to our borders now as a Warsaw Pact tank was two
decades ago,'' she said.
	   At the meeting today, the allies assessed the situation in
Kosovo, where Serb security forces and ethnic Albanian guerrillas
clashed for seven months. The threat of NATO airstrikes stopped the
fighting in October and the cease-fire is generally holding, while
American mediator Christopher Hill seeks a political agreement.
	   ``Kosovo is a critical test not only for NATO, but for Europe's
larger security structure,'' Albright said.
	   The foreign ministers agreed today not to cut the number of
troops in the NATO-led multinational peacekeeping force in Bosnia,
leaving the force at 32,000.
	   However, they warned in a statement that the Bosnia
Stabilization Force ``cannot be maintained indefinitely nor does it
reduce the responsibility of the authorities (in Bosnia) to ensure
the stability of their country.''
	   The ministers also said one of the key tasks for 1999 would be
to accelerate the return of Bosnian refugees.
	   German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer said adapting to change
has always been one of NATO's strong points.
	   ``One of the special qualities of the alliance has always been
its ability to react flexibly to new situations,'' he said. ``On
the eve of the 21st century we should ask ourselves if our
instruments still match the changed security environment.''
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook stressed the increased role
Europeans want to play in continental security, particularly in
cases where the United States is less interested in participating.
	   Solana said the EU, Europe's economic alliance, is changing and
NATO's plans must be adapted to the changes in the EU. ``We are
trying to reconcile these things.''
	   Albright proposed setting up a Center for Weapons of Mass
Destruction, essentially on how to best share and use intelligence.
The plan would use existing NATO headquarters staff under one
director, with perhaps a few extra experts.
	   The Germans planned to bring up the nuclear first-strike
question later in the meeting. Fischer made waves when he called on
NATO last month to consider dropping its doctrine allowing a
nuclear first-strike. The Germans don't have much backing on the
issue, however.

 &UR; Torture of Kosovo Albanians widespread in Serbian jails, human
rights group says &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ More than 1,000 Kosovo Albanians are
believed to be in Serbian prisons and police stations, and at least
five have died from beatings and torture, the U.S.-based Human
Rights Watch said Tuesday.
	   ``Five individuals are known to have died in detention since
July 1998 from the violence inflicted on them by the police prison
guards,'' said a Human Rights Watch statement.
	   The statement, faxed to The Associated Press bureau in Belgrade,
said hundreds of others have been injured from beatings and
torture, often used to extract confessions.
	   The latest government figures say that 684 ethnic Albanians have
been arrested for allegedly supporting ``terrorism'' since
February. That is when authorities began a crackdown on ethnic
Albanian separatists in Kosovo, a majority Albanian province in
Serbia.
	   But the Human Rights Watch said in the statement that local and
international human rights groups believe the actual number of
those arrested is closer to 1,500, including human rights
activists, doctors, humanitarian aid workers and lawyers, ``many of
whom were physically abused.''
	   ``The Serbian government's military offensive may have slowed
down for winter,'' said Holly Cartner, Executive Director of Human
Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia Division. ``But the legal
offensive is in full swing, despite the government's promise to
grant amnesty.''
	   On Oct. 14, the Serbian government announced general amnesty for
``crimes related to the conflict in Kosovo'' and promised that no
one would be prosecuted ``except for crimes against humanity and
international law.''
	   ``Despite those promises, large number of ethnic Albanians
remain in custody and Human Rights Watch has no information that
anyone arrested during the conflict has been released as a result
of this amnesty.''
	   ``Simply being an Albanian in Kosovo is enough to merit an
arrest and torture,'' Ms. Cartner said in a statement. She also
said defendants are often denied access to a lawyer, not allowed to
view court documents, or refused permission to present witnesses in
their defense.
	   The human rights organization also documented illegal detentions
of Serbs and ethnic Albanians loyal to the government by the rebel
ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army which has been fighting
government troops.
	   ``Estimates of ethnic Serbs and Albanians abducted by the KLA
range from 100 to 300, but it is not known whether those people
have fled the region, are in hiding, have been killed, or are
currently in KLA custody,'' the statement said.
	   The International Red Cross ``has been denied access to KLA
detainees, which raises additional concerns for their safety,'' it
added.

NATO revising strategy in line with changes in Europe

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO foreign ministers began the
process Tuesday of revising the 16-nation alliance's strategic
concept, the military and political principles that guide the NATO
mission.
	   The ministers are laying the groundwork for the 50th anniversary
NATO summit in Washington April 24-25, where leaders are expected
to approve the alliance's strategy for the 21st century and welcome
three new members, Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, into the
fold.
	   ``One of the special qualities of the alliance has always been
its ability to react flexibly to new situations,'' German Foreign
Minister Joschka Fischer told fellow ministers. ``On the eve of the
21st century we should ask ourselves if our instruments still match
the changed security environment.''
	   Today's threat is no longer a Russian tank assault across the
plains of Central Europe, but challenges from regional conflicts
like Bosnia and Kosovo, terrorism and the spread of weapons of mass
destruction. When these threats originate from outside NATO's
traditional territory of operations, the alliance must be prepared
to deal with them.
	   In practice, NATO has already adjusted to these new realities,
intervening in Bosnia, halting the humanitarian disaster in Kosovo
with the threat of airstrikes, sending soldiers just across the
Kosovo border in Macedonia to rescue civilian cease-fire monitors
if needed.
	   ``NATO is already acting out of area, so let's not dramatize
that,'' said NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana.
	   Added British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook: ``I think we have to
be pragmatic and grown up about this. That will require making a
judgment on a case-by-case basis.''
	   Cook stressed the increased role that the Europeans want to play
in continental security, particularly in cases where the United
States is less interested in participating. NATO is developing a
policy it calls the European Security and Defense Identity to deal
with that, but France and Britain are pressing for the European
Union to play a role too.
	   ``The focus must be strengthening and improving the European
security identity,'' Cook said, stressing nonetheless that ``NATO
will remain the basis for territorial defense for the EU.''
	   Solana said the European Union economic alliance is changing and
NATO's plans must be adapted to the changes. ``We are trying to
reconcile these things.''
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, writing in the
British newspaper The Financial Times, said: ``NATO's primary
mission will always remain defense against aggression. But the
founders of the alliance also distinguished between what the treaty
commits us to do and what it permits us to do.''
	   She said Bosnia and Kosovo are recent examples ``that
demonstrate NATO must act when conflicts beyond its immediate
borders affect alliance interests. NATO must find the right balance
between the centrality of NATO's collective defense missions and
responding to such crises.''
	   NATO's central mission will always be collective defense and the
concept that an attack against one member is an aggression against
all. But attacks against members now take different forms and often
originate far away.
	   Albright planned to propose at the ministerial meeting here
setting up a Center for Weapons of Mass Destruction, essentially on
how to best share and use intelligence, officials said.
	   The Germans plan to bring up the nuclear first-strike question
later in the meeting.
	   Fischer made waves when he called on NATO last month to consider
dropping its doctrine allowing a nuclear first-strike. This
doctrine, reaffirmed as recently as last year, has always been a
part of NATO's nuclear strategy and is considered an important
aspect of deterrence.
	   ``The minister will certainly raise the issue,'' a German
diplomatic source said. ``We have to see that in the context of
arms control, arms reduction and nonproliferation.''
	   The Germans don't have much backing on the issue, however.
	   The allies assessed the situation in Kosovo, where Serb security
forces and ethnic Albanian guerrillas clashed for seven months. The
threat of a NATO airstrike stopped the fighting in October and the
cease-fire is generally holding, while U.S.mediator Christopher
Hill attempts to firm the peace with political agreement.
	   The ministers also made their six-monthly review of the
situation in Bosnia. No major reduction in the 32,000-troop level
in the NATO-led peacekeeping force is expected soon.

Kosovo rebels reject U.S. peace draft

suggesting Hill should be replaced; Human Rights Watch statement on
torture. No Pickup. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The chief spokesman for Kosovo
Albanian rebels rejected the latest peace plan for the troubled
province on Tuesday, and urged the removal of a U.S. envoy for
alleged pro-Serb bias.
	   Adem Demaci also acknowledged that the rebel Kosovo Liberation
Army was using lull in the Kosovo fighting to arm itself and
prepare for more battles with government troops in Serbia.
	   ``The KLA has no illusion that the (Serb) regime will
democratize overnight and that it will give up trying to find a
solution through force for the Kosovo crisis,'' Demaci said. ``It
would be dangerous if the Albanians don't continue arming
themselves and preparing for resistance.''
	   Hundreds were killed and almost 300,000 ethnic Albanians
displaced in a seven-month crackdown by Serbian forces against
Kosovo's separatists, before an October peace agreement brought
about a tentative truce.
	   Demaci said that the latest peace plan drafted by the U.S. envoy
for Kosovo, Christopher Hill, is ``fully unacceptable'' primarily
because it doesn't envisage what will happen to the KLA.
	   ``Mr. Hill either doesn't understand the Albanian problems, or
he is leaning toward the Serbs,'' Demaci said, adding: ``The State
Department should reconsider the results of his work'' and ``send
us more qualified people.''
	   On Monday, the chief negotiator of the more moderate Albanian
faction in Kosovo also rejected the draft, but the United States
pledged to keep working on a formula for a political solution in
Kosovo.
	   The negotiator, Fehmi Agani said the draft was ``unacceptable''
because it was too close to the views of Serbia, the main republic
of Yugoslavia. Serbia refuses to consider any Kosovo plan that
would substantially reduce its control over the ethnic
Albanian-majority province.
	   More than 1,000 Kosovo Albanians are believed to be in Serbian
prisons and police stations, and at least five have died from
beatings and torture, the U.S.-based Human Rights Watch said
Tuesday.
	   ``Five individuals are known to have died in detention since
July 1998 from the violence inflicted on them by the police prison
guards,'' said a Human Rights Watch statement.
	   The statement, faxed to The Associated Press in Belgrade, said
hundreds of others have been injured from beatings and torture,
often used to extract confessions.
	   Most ethnic Albanians want independence or substantial
self-rule, whereas Serbia, in its proposal for Kosovo released last
month, has offered only a degree of autonomy while keeping the
province firmly under Serbian control.
	   Washington, however, opposes full independence, fearing that
would lead to similar demands by other ethnic Albanian communities
elsewhere in the southern Balkans.
	   That in turn could destabilize what has historically been one of
Europe's most unstable regions.
	   Although fighting has all but ceased since the October accord,
there are fears that Kosovo will again explode unless a political
solution is found by spring.
	   Ivan Sedlak, an official on the Serbian negotiating team, said
the Serbian government has not studied Hill's latest plan. He said
the previous U.S. version was unacceptable because it defined
Kosovo virtually as a separate state.

David Batty completes move back to Leeds
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LEEDS, England (AP) _ England midfielder David Batty completed
his 4.4-million-pound (dlrs 7 million) move from Newcastle to Leeds
on Tuesday, signing a 4 1/2-year contract with the club where he
started his career.
	   The 30-year-old Batty, who started as a trainee at Leeds in 1987
and helped the Elland Road club to the league title in 1992, will
be in the Leeds' lineup against Coventry next Monday night.
	   Batty, who was born in Leeds, moved to Blackburn in 1993, then
joined Newcastle in 1996. He has not fit in under Ruud Gullit, who
took over as Newcastle manager after Kenny Dalglish was fired
earlier this season.
	   Batty is manager David O'Leary's first signing since taking over
from George Graham as Leeds manager in October. He remains a
popular figure with Leeds fans and will be an important addition to
an in-form team lying third in the league standings.
	   ``David Batty is a one-off,'' club chairman Peter Ridsdale said.
``His heart is here and we are delighted to have him back. Leeds
United are playing the sort of football people have not given us
credit for in the past. We are playing an exciting brand of
football and now, with the signing of David Batty, people can
justifiably say `watch out for Leeds United.'''
	   Batty said there were no hard feelings towards Newcastle and
that the motivation behind his move was a desire to return to where
his career began
	   ``I hope Newcastle fans do not take this as a snub,'' he
said.``Obviously, I'm pleased the deadlock has been resolved
between the two clubs and I'm particularly grateful to Ruud Gullit
for the reasonable attitude he has displayed throughout all this.''
	   Batty is the third senior player, after defender Steve Watson
and French striker Stephane Guivarc'h, to leave Newcastle since
Gullit's arrival.
	   Gary McAllister, another member of the Leeds midfield which
fired the club to the title in 1992, is set to face Batty for
Coventry.
	   ``It's a great move for David,'' McAllister said. ``He's a Leeds
boy and he will get a tremendous reception when he runs out against
us. He is probably in the prime of his career at the moment and he
is going into a good young side.''

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A judge who ruled that Gen. Augusto Pinochet does
not have immunity from arrest is a director of a charity run by
Amnesty International, the group campaigning for the former Chilean
dictator to face charges of genocide and murder acknowledged
Tuesday, while lobbyists stepped up pressure over Spain's request
for his extradition.
	   Shouting ``take your hands out of Chile,'' Pinochet supporters
demonstrated outside Prime Minister Tony Blair's Downing Street
office, and opponents planned a wreath-laying for victims of his
secret police.
	   ``We are widows of members of the armed forces and policemen
that were killed in terrorist attacks by Marxist terrorist groups
in Chile,'' said Veronica Vallejos who handed in a letter on behalf
of 700 families urging the government to block extradition of the
83-year-old general and send him home.
	   Controversy over links with Amnesty International of South
African-born Lord Justice Leonard Hoffman was the latest twist in
the tug-of-war over Pinochet, a regular visitor to Britain who was
arrested Oct. 16 on a Spanish warrant.
	   Home Secretary Jack Straw must decide by Friday whether
extradition proceedings can go ahead following the 3-2 ruling Nov.
25 by five judges of Britain's highest court, the House of Lords,
against Pinochet.
	   He is awaiting Straw's decision under police guard in a rented
mansion at Wentworth, some 20 miles (30 kms) west of London.
	   A Chilean government report says 3,197 people were murdered or
disappeared at the hands of the secret police during Pinochet's
1973-90 rule after he overthrew Salvador Allende, an elected
Marxist. But Chile's government wants him back, partly to avoid
exacerbating domestic tensions and threatening the country's newly
built democracy.
	   Amnesty International said Hoffman, 64, an opponent of apartheid
who settled in Britain in the `60s, has served since 1990 as the
unpaid director and chairman of Amnesty International Charity Ltd.
which gets donations for work on human rights.
	   His wife, Gillian, also a liberal South African, is a secretary
in Amnesty International's press office in London.
	   Hoffman and his wife had no involvement in the Pinochet
campaign, said Amnesty International spokeswoman Soraya Bermejo.
She accused Pincohet supporters of trying to divert attention from
the basic issue of whether he should be tried.
	   ``There are many lawyers who have links with human rights
organizations,'' Ms. Bermejo told the AP.
	   ``In fact when Lord Hoffman was appointed to this case we saw
him as being slightly unpredictable on a human rights,'' she added,
noting that he recently ruled against a man who was sentenced to
death sentence in the Bahamas, a former colony which still allows
appeals to Britain's highest court.
	   In the Pinochet case, the five judges _ in an usual move _
allowed lawyers for Amnesty International to make representations.
	   The judges included another native South African, Lord Johan
Steyn, who also ruled against Pinochet.

Potential coalition partner calls for tax cut to revive Japan's
</HEADLINE>
economy

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The head of an opposition party in talks with
Japan's ruling party about forming a coalition government said
Tuesday that he will press for a sweeping tax cut to turn around
the nation's sagging economy.
	   Ichiro Ozawa, head of the Liberal Party, called for temporarily
suspending a 5 percent national sales tax, something the governing
Liberal Democratic Party has fiercely rejected.
	   Ozawa didn't specify how long he wants to halt the unpopular
tax. But he said without such a step to boost consumption, last
month's record 24 trillion yen (dlrs 200 billion) economic stimulus
package would fail to pull the economy out of recession.
	   Ozawa, who has been negotiating with LDP leaders about a joint
Cabinet, said the ruling party would have to accept his party's
more drastic views.
	   ``In the not-too-distant future, it's going to reach a point
where the government will have to accept what we have been pushing
for, including the tax system reform,'' Ozawa told an audience at
Tokyo's Waseda University.
	   Ozawa's Liberals were expected to get as many as two Cabinet
spots if they join forces with the LDP, which needs their votes to
move closer to a majority in the upper house of Japan's bicameral
Parliament.
	   The LDP have defended the national sales tax as necessary to
cover the costs of Japan's rapidly aging population.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Japanese swimmers buried the
humiliation of their 1994 defeat by a drug-tainted Chinese team in
a night of triumph at the Asian Games pool Tuesday, winning four
golds to their rivals' none in the session.
	   China grabbed 25 golds to Japan's five in the 1994 Games at
Hiroshima, only to plunge into disgrace after seven members tested
positive for steroids.
	   One of those, Xiong Guoming, returned to Asian Games action
Tuesday after his four gold medals in 1994 were followed by his
positive steroid test and subsequent two-year ban.
	   Xiong almost made a winning comeback but was beaten by Japan's
Takahiro Mori in a thrilling finish to their 400-meter individual
medley.
	   Mori joined compatriots Masami Tanaka, Takashi Yamamoto and the
men's 4x200-meter relay team on the gold medal dais Tuesday as
Japan led China 6-3 with 10 of the 32 golds decided. China must win
all of the remaining 22 to match its performance in Hiroshima.
	   ``We had a team meeting on the first night here and we agreed to
ourselves that we would beat China,'' Mori said Tuesday. ``Compared
with four years ago, the Japanese team is stronger. But China's
younger swimmers are strong too.''
	   Xiong held a healthy lead halfway through the race but Mori, 18,
did the damage over the first 50 meters of the final leg of
freestyle. He clocked 4 minutes, 20.98 seconds, with Xiong touching
in 4:22.57 and Thailand's Ratapong Sirisanont third in 4:24.15.
	   Xiong said he was clean of drugs now.
	   ``It will not be a problem this time _ I'm certain,'' he added.
	   He put down China's poor performance to inexperience. ``The
Chinese team is going through some adjustments,'' Xiong said. ``A
number of young swimmers have joined our team as part of the
preparations for the (Sydney) Olympics.''
	   There were also traces of China's drug past in the women's
200-meter breaststroke, won by Tanaka, who has the sixth best time
in the world this year.
	   The 1994 champion was Yuan Yuan, who did not test positive in
Hiroshima but was nabbed earlier this year with 13 vials of banned
growth hormone in her luggage as she arrived for the world
championships in Perth, Australia.
	   Tanaka, 19, won in 2 minutes, 28.44 seconds against China's Qi
Hui (2:28.71) as even the tight finishes fell Japan's way. Japan's
Junko Isoda was third.
	   Yamamoto gave Japan a fine start Tuesday when he claimed the
100-meter butterfly in 53.34 seconds.
	   China was also upstaged by Tsai Shu-min, who gave Taiwan its
first gold of the meet by winning the women's 200-meter freestyle.
	   Tsai, the top-ranked member of the field, having clocked the
seventh fastest time in the world this year, started slowly in lane
2 but turned up the tempo from the 100-meter mark.
	   She swept away from early leader Sachiko Yamada, who finished
third. China's Qin Caini improved down the stretch for silver.
	   Japan's hopes of revenge for 1994 received another boost Tuesday
with word that Chinese world champion Chen Yan is in doubt for the
rest of the meet after suffering diarrhea. She was badly beaten in
her favorite 400-meter medley Monday by Japan's Yasuko Tajima, and
didn't swim in Tuesday's freestyle heats.
	   ``As she is rather weak now, whether she will continue to
compete in the games is still in doubt, not to say winning gold,''
said coach Han Mingyan. The 200 medley is still to come.
	   Swimmers from other countries have complained long and hard
about the Chinese, and the East Germans before them. The U.S.
Olympic Committee is seeking gold medals for a relay team beaten by
a drug-tainted East German outfit, while some Australian swimmers
have claimed that drugs, rather than talent, cost them medals at
the 1992 Olympics and 1994 Rome world championships.
	   But Japanese team spokesman Shiego Ogata said his country did
not come here for revenge based on the 1994 results and subsequent
scandals.
	   ``We don't care about individual countries,'' Ogata said
Tuesday. ``We just want everyone to be clean.''
	   China has failed to make the same impact at any meet since the
1994 Asian Games, while International Olympic Committee president
Juan Antonio Samaranch has praised its recent efforts to eradicate
drug use.

Heads of four abducted foreigners found
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with 12 grafs to UPDATE with Chechen official commenting

<TEXT>
	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ Chechen authorities today found the
decapitated heads of four kidnapped foreigners near a remote
village after a two-month search in the breakaway region in
southern Russia.
	   An Associated Press reporter saw four severed heads near the
village of Assinovskaya, about 25 miles west of Grozny, the Chechen
capital. He did not see any other remains.
	   The heads were identified as those of the four foreigners by
their former bodyguard, Umar Makhauri. Makhauri was assigned to the
three Britons and one New Zealander at the time they were abducted
Oct. 3 by unidentified gunmen in Grozny. He said the rest of their
bodies had not been found.
	   Chechen government officials at the scene said four bodies had
been found, but gave no further details. Chechen President Aslan
Maskhadov said in Grozny that the bodies of four men had been
recovered, but also gave no further details.
	   The hostages _ Britons Peter Kennedy, Darren Hickey, and Rudolf
Petschi, and New Zealander Stanley Shaw _ were engineers. They were
working for Granger Telecom, a British telephone company,
installing 300,000 telephone lines across Chechnya.
	   Spokesmen at the British and New Zealand embassies in Moscow
said they were checking on reports the four men had been killed,
but could not comment.
	   The British Foreign Ministry in London said it was investigating
reports the bodies had been found.
	   A spokesman for Granger Telecom in Britain said, ``We have heard
the reports and are obviously investigating, but there is nothing
we can say at this stage.''
	   Eamon Hickey, the father of one of the missing men, said he
heard the news and was hoping it would not be confirmed.
	   ``There is so much rumor and counter-rumor coming from out there
that we don't know what to think. Obviously we are hoping and
praying that it does not turn out to be true,'' he said at his home
in England.
	   Chechen authorities had been searching for the missing men for
the past two months. British officials said they had not received
any ransom demand for the missing men.
	   Chechen acting First Vice Premier Turpal Atgeriyev, who is
heading the investigation into the killings, said authorities had
several suspects in the abduction, but have failed to make any
progress, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Maskhadov said the deaths of the four men were a major blow to
Chechnya and its efforts to gain international recognition of its
independence. He blamed the rash of abductions in Chechnya to
unidentified ``outside forces'' and their Chechen henchmen.
	   ``I am ready to answer before my people and the whole world for
what happened,'' he was quoted as saying by the Interfax news
agency.
	   Hostage-takings, usually for ransom, have become common in
Chechnya since the end of the breakaway republic's two-year war for
independence from Russia in 1996. But victims are rarely killed.
	   Since the beginning of 1998, 176 people have been kidnapped in
the North Caucasus region of Russia, including dozens of
foreigners, and 90 of them released, officials have said.

Clashes in West Bank, Netanyahu under pressure to freeze accord
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ New clashes erupted Tuesday in the West Bank as
domestic pressure mounted on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to
abandon the Wye River land-for-security agreement with the
Palestinians.
	   The violence and Israel's political turmoil came just five days
before the start of U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit to Israel
and the Palestinian areas.
	   The trip was intended to shore up the Wye agreement and restore
calm to the region, but appeared to be having the opposite effect.
	   In Gaza City, armored personnel carriers were deployed outside
the convention center where Clinton is to address 1,500 Palestinian
delegates next week. Later in the week, streets around the hall
will be sealed.
	   The Palestinians have presented a plan for protecting Clinton to
U.S. Secret Service agents in Gaza and the United States, in turn,
has given the Palestinians sophisticated bomb detection devices.
	   The Islamic militant group Hamas has not openly threatened the
president. However, it is bent on derailing U.S. peace effort and
has carried out more than a dozen suicide bombings in Israel.
	   In three separate West Bank clashes, Palestinians threw stones
at Israeli troops and motorists. In the town of Ram, north of
Jerusalem, soldiers fired tear gas and rubber bullets at high
school students, injuring four. In the Kalandia refugee, troops
fired rubber bullets after their jeep was stoned and an officer was
lightly injured. Near biblical Bethlehem, an 11-year-old Israeli
girl was hurt when stones struck the car she was riding in.
	   Tensions in the Palestinian areas have been running high in
recent days because of the dispute with Israel over releases of
Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails. The Palestinians hope
that Clinton will back up demands that as part of the Wye accord,
Israel release more Palestinians held for anti-Israeli activities.
	   Also Tuesday, dozens of Jewish settlers protested outside
Netanyahu's office after assailants, apparently Palestinians,
wounded a West Bank settler in a drive-by shooting late Monday.
	   The victim is a resident of the Ganim settlement, one of several
that became isolated enclaves after Israel withdrew troops from 2
percent of the West Bank in the first stage of the Wye agreement.
	   ``Only 17 days have passed since the withdrawal and already they
are shooting at us,'' read a sign held up by protesters.
	   In a Jerusalem hospital, a 21-year-old Palestinian university
student, Nasr Erekat, remained hooked up to life support after
being shot in a clash with an Israeli civilian and soldiers.
	   Erekat is a cousin of the chief Palestinian peace negotiator,
Saeb Erekat, who accused Netanyahu of triggering new violence by
suspending the upcoming Israeli troop pullback in the West Bank
until Arafat meets a number of demands.
	   As part of the Wye agreement, five percent of the land is to be
transferred from Israeli control to joint jurisdiction next week.
	   Erekat said Netanyahu's decision ``has to do with his survival
as prime minister and the survival of his coalition,'' not with
alleged Palestinian violations of the accord.
	   An official close to Netanyahu, speaking on condition of
anonymity, also said the prime minister's toughened stance was
aimed mainly at preventing the fall of his government.
	   Israeli media have said that when Netanyahu announced the
suspension, ostensibly because of a brutal Palestinian attack on an
Israeli soldier, he had already made a secret deal with coalition
hard-liners to freeze the peace accord. In exchange, the
hard-liners agreed to withdraw support for an early elections bill.
	   On Monday, when the bill came up for a first of three readings,
Netanyahu still did not have enough support. In a desperate move to
buy time, Netanyahu had a coalition partner, the United Torah
Front, seek a no-confidence vote in his own government, thus
postponing the decision on early elections by two weeks.
	   Israeli commentators said Tuesday that until then, Netanyahu
will do everything in his power to win back the hawkish renegades.
	   However, their minimal price is a written Netanyahu promise that
he will walk away from the Wye agreement for good. Netanyahu
``allowed himself to become a hostage of the right wing,''
commentator Nahum Barnea wrote in the Yediot Ahronot daily.
	   On the other hand, Netanyahu's battle for political survival
coincides with the Clinton visit during which he will come under
intense U.S. pressure to keep his side of the peace agreement.

Russian hard currency reserves fall 8 percent in a month
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's hard currency reserves fell 8 percent
last month, drained by debt payments and efforts to prop up the
increasingly weak ruble, officials said today.
	   The Central Bank's reserves, which stood at $13.6 billion at the
start of November, shrank to $12.5 billion by the end of the month,
the Interfax news agency reported, quoting a bank announcement.
	   Reserves have dropped by nearly 30 percent since the start of
the year, the bank said.
	   The Central Bank spent reserves trying to halt the steady
decline of the ruble, which is now at more than 20 to the U.S.
dollar. Before the economic crisis hit in August, the ruble was
trading at around 6 to the dollar.
	   Since Russia's financial meltdown in August, the ruble has been
closely watched as a bellwether of economic confidence in the
country. Its steady dive has reflected fears that the government
will crank up the printing presses to pay domestic and foreign
debts _ almost certain to result in high inflation.
	   In other bad news, overall government revenues totaled $10.8
billion for the first 10 months of the year, or 59 percent of
target levels, the Finance Ministry said, according to the Interfax
news agency.
	   The government's chronic inability to meet tax collection and
revenue targets has been a serious stumbling block in its efforts
to reform the economy.
	   The International Monetary Fund and a group of other lenders put
together a $22.6 billion bailout package last summer, but only
released around $5 billion before freezing further installments.
	   Lenders want the government to come up with a viable budget
before resuming the loans. The IMF has criticized the earlier
government's blueprint as overly optimistic on revenues and heavy
with administrative controls over the economy.
	   After several delays, the Cabinet plans to pass the 1999 budget
on Thursday and will submit the document to the parliament soon
after, officials said. The budget will include bills aimed at
streamlining the country's unwieldy tax system.
	   In the past few years, the government and the parliament have
failed to finalize the budget before the start of the budget year,
further complicating the process.
	   However, First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov said today
he expects swift passage of the budget by the parliament this year.
Unlike previous Cabinets, the current government enjoys broad
support in the Communist-dominated State Duma, or lower house.
	   In other economic developments:
	   _ Russian crude oil production dropped 1 percent from January
through October, to 244.4 million metric tons, the State Statistics
Committee said.
	   _ Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir Bulgak called on the European
Union to revoke anti-dumping measures against Russian exports,
which cost Russia $300 million annually, the Interfax news agency
reported.

`Vampire' of violence sucking life from Greek soccer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ It's a bad time for soccer in Greece.
	   ``Our country is being internationally defamed at the time it is
preparing to organize the Olympic Games,'' said a recent report
issued by a parliamentary committee on soccer.
	   But most Greeks don't need a document to tell them something is
rotten with Greece's most popular sport.
	   All they have to do is follow the 18-team first division soccer
league, where the coverage lately is as much about clashes as
goals.
	   The latest wave of vandalism and violence began with allegations
of biased refereeing. The suspicions are fed by fans and team
owners and probed by sports newspapers, which have reported
accusations that some referees have been bribed.
	   ``Something stinks and the politicians have an obligation to do
something about it,'' the president of the Panathinaikos Athens
soccer club, Giorgos Vardinoyiannis, was quoted as saying in
newspapers Tuesday.
	   Now, every questionable call or narrow defeat is being blamed on
corruption. This growing belief in conspiracies and game fixing has
stoked tempers to unprecedented levels.
	   During Sunday's first-division match between Olympiakos Piraeus
and longtime rival Panathinaikos, fans burned cars, stoned police,
beat up bystanders and tore seats from the stadium that will host
the 2004 Olympic Games. Olympiakos took the game 4-2.
	   One year ago, both teams were ordered to pay more than dlrs 1
million in fines after their fans tried to set the Olympic stadium
on fire during a similar match.
	   The Athens daily Ta Nea declared that sportsmanship ``has been
buried.'' But the game is ``like a vampire (and) insists on walking
around.''
	   Worries about mayhem have game attendance dropping steadily.
Only 30,000 die-hard fans or members of organized clubs went to the
80,000-seat Olympic stadium on Saturday.
	   Police are also tired. Their unions have for months been
agitating to be relieved of security and riot control duty at
stadiums. They argue that clubs _ which are privately owned
corporations _ receive dlrs millions in subsidies from state soccer
pools and should pay for their own security.
	   A law passed 12 years ago barring rowdy fans from stadiums has
never been fully implemented.
	   According to the parliamentary report, the core problem is that
``there is a general lack of credibility that creates a climate of
doubt and suspicion'' that results in violence.
	   Last year, nearly half the country's 300 lawmakers issued a
statement complaining that soccer ``is being led to decline and
extermination.''
	   But instead of calming things down, some government officials
only reinforce that belief of behind-the-scene meddling in the
sport.
	   When PAOK Salonica fans took to the streets to protest judge's
decision to penalize their team after its fans started a riot and
beat a referee, they found a supporter in Defense Minister Akis
Tsochadzopoulos.
	   ``Look there is a great outcry in Salonica, and I think it's
justified,'' Tsochadzopoulos said of his home town. ``Once more it
was proven that the well-known `godfathers' of soccer struck.''
	   But Tsochadzopoulos refused to name the alleged culprits _
bolstering the idea among some fans, and club owners, that the fix
is in.
	   Some irate PAOK fans even saw a broader conspiracy. On Sunday,
they burned more than 1,000 cable decoders because the pay-TV
station that broadcasts league games only showed nine minutes of
the PAOK match.
	   Whatever the causes, the results have led many Greeks away from
what was once a national pastime. Some commentators say that may
not be a bad idea.
	   ``Maybe we should just take the decision that the sickness of
which we all speak is incurable, that's it and whoever likes it,''
wrote columnist Errikos Bartzinopoulos in the Athens daily Ethnos.

TRIM. No pickup. &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC;

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Updating NATO's guiding military and
political principles is not _ as critics contend _ an attempt to
create a ``global NATO'' far beyond the intent of the original
treaty, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Tuesday.
	   Foreign ministers from the 16-nation alliance met in Brussels to
lay the groundwork for April's 50th anniversary NATO summit in
Washington, where leaders are expected to approve the alliance's
strategy for the 21st century.
	   Today's threat is no longer a Russian tank assault across the
plains of Central Europe, but challenges from regional conflicts
like Bosnia and Kosovo, terrorism and the spread of weapons of mass
destruction.
	   In practice, NATO already has adjusted to these new realities,
intervening in Bosnia, halting the humanitarian disaster in Kosovo
with the threat of airstrikes, and stationing soldiers in Macedonia
to rescue Kosovo cease-fire monitors if needed.
	   ``We must be prepared because we know that events beyond NATO's
immediate borders can affect vital alliance interests,'' Albright
said. ``Common sense tells us that it is sometimes better to deal
with instability when it is still at arms length than to wait until
it is at our doorstep.''
	   NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said thinking beyond NATO's
traditional territory is nothing new. ``NATO is already acting out
of area, so let's not dramatize that,'' he said.
	   Albright responded to suggestions that assuming new missions
beyond collective European defense is tinkering with the original
North Atlantic Treaty: ``I've said it before; I will repeat it
again today: This is hogwash.''
	   ``I often remind people that a ballistic missile attack using a
weapon of mass destruction from a rogue state is every bit as much
a ... threat to our borders now as a Warsaw Pact tank was two
decades ago,'' she said.
	   At the meeting Tuesday, the allies assessed the situation in
Kosovo, where Serb security forces and ethnic Albanian guerrillas
clashed for seven months. The threat of NATO airstrikes stopped the
fighting in October and the cease-fire is generally holding, while
U.S. mediator Christopher Hill seeks a political agreement.
	   ``Kosovo is a critical test not only for NATO, but for Europe's
larger security structure,'' Albright said.
	   The foreign ministers agreed Tuesday not to cut the number of
troops in the NATO-led multinational peacekeeping force in Bosnia,
leaving the force at 32,000.
	   However, they warned in a statement that the Bosnia
Stabilization Force ``cannot be maintained indefinitely nor does it
reduce the responsibility of the authorities (in Bosnia) to ensure
the stability of their country.''
	   The ministers also said one of the key tasks for 1999 would be
to accelerate the return of Bosnian refugees.
	   German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer said adapting to change
has always been one of NATO's strong points.
	   ``One of the special qualities of the alliance has always been
its ability to react flexibly to new situations,'' he said. ``On
the eve of the 21st century we should ask ourselves if our
instruments still match the changed security environment.''
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook stressed the increased role
Europeans want to play in continental security, particularly in
cases where the United States is less interested in participating.
	   Solana said the EU, Europe's economic alliance, is changing and
NATO's plans must be adapted to the changes in the EU. ``We are
trying to reconcile these things.''
	   Albright proposed setting up a Center for Weapons of Mass
Destruction, essentially on how to best share and use intelligence.
The plan would use existing NATO headquarters staff under one
director, with perhaps a few extra experts.
	   The Germans planned to bring up the nuclear first-strike
question later in the meeting. Fischer made waves when he called on
NATO last month to consider dropping its doctrine allowing a
nuclear first-strike. The Germans don't have much backing on the
issue, however.

Sudan bombs southern Sudan town

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Sudanese air force bombed a southern Sudan
town where a hospital operated by a Norwegian aid agency is located
but there were no injuries, the Norwegian People's Aid said
Tuesday.
	   A lone Antonov plane dropped six bombed at Chuckudum, about 40
kilometers (25 miles) north of Uganda's border Monday, said Dan
Eiffie, a spokesman for the NPA.
	   Eiffie said two Norwegian and an Irish visitors witnessed the
raid.
	   Chuckudum is located in Eastern Equitoria province and there are
no rebel military installations or camps for displaced people,
Eiffie said.
	   ``This why NPA chose it as a location for their hospital and
medical school training, plus a community resource center,'' Eiffie
said.
	   The town was last bombed two years ago, Eiffie said.
	   There were no independent confirmations but the NPA has in the
past been reliable on events in southern Sudan.
	   The air force has bombed at least six times an NPA hospital in
Yei, about 160 kilometers (100 miles) southwest of Juba, since Yei
was captured by the Sudan People's Liberation Army in March 1997.
	   Juba is 1,200 kilometers (745 miles) south of the Sudanese
capital, Khartoum, and is the largest southern Sudan town still
controlled by the government.
	   ``These bombing incidents seem to follow a pattern of targeting
important institutions such as hospitals,'' Eiffie said.
	   He said the aim of the bombings is to ensure life does not
return to normal in areas controlled by the SPLA.
	   Eiffie said it is not surprising Sudanese air force has been
bombing NPA's four hospitals in southern Sudan because Foreign
Minister Mustafa Osman Ismail in a recent visit to Norway said they
are legitimate military targets. Eiffie disputed that.
	   ``The hospitals are filled with all kinds of patients, mostly
elderly, plus women and children,'' Eiffie said.
	   He said on average, the hospitals serve a regional population of
500,000 people and ``they are the most critical health services for
the survival of many very ill people.''
	   The the rebels control nearly all the countryside and most towns
except Juba and Wau, the capital of southwestern Bhar el-Ghazal
province.
	   At least 1.5 million people in one of the world's poorest and
most underdeveloped nations _ the largest in Africa _ have died
either as a result of the fighting or the resulting famines.

Kosovo rebels reject U.S. peace draft

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The chief spokesman for Kosovo
Albanian rebels rejected the latest peace plan for the troubled
province on Tuesday, and urged the removal of a U.S. envoy for
alleged pro-Serb bias.
	   Adem Demaci also acknowledged that the rebel Kosovo Liberation
Army was using lull in the Kosovo fighting to arm itself and
prepare for more battles with government troops in Serbia.
	   ``The KLA has no illusion that the (Serb) regime will
democratize overnight and that it will give up trying to find a
solution through force for the Kosovo crisis,'' Demaci said. ``It
would be dangerous if the Albanians don't continue arming
themselves and preparing for resistance.''
	   Hundreds were killed and almost 300,000 ethnic Albanians
displaced in a seven-month crackdown by Serbian forces against
Kosovo's separatists, before an October peace agreement brought
about a tentative truce.
	   Demaci said that the latest peace plan drafted by the U.S. envoy
for Kosovo, Christopher Hill, is ``fully unacceptable'' primarily
because it doesn't envisage what will happen to the KLA.
	   ``Mr. Hill either doesn't understand the Albanian problems, or
he is leaning toward the Serbs,'' Demaci said, adding: ``The State
Department should reconsider the results of his work'' and ``send
us more qualified people.''
	   On Monday, the chief negotiator of the more moderate Albanian
faction in Kosovo also rejected the draft, but the United States
pledged to keep working on a formula for a political solution in
Kosovo.
	   The negotiator, Fehmi Agani said the draft was ``unacceptable''
because it was too close to the views of Serbia, the main republic
of Yugoslavia. Serbia refuses to consider any Kosovo plan that
would substantially reduce its control over the ethnic
Albanian-majority province.
	   More than 1,000 Kosovo Albanians are believed to be in Serbian
prisons and police stations, and at least five have died from
beatings and torture, the U.S.-based Human Rights Watch said
Tuesday.
	   ``Five individuals are known to have died in detention since
July 1998 from the violence inflicted on them by the police prison
guards,'' said a Human Rights Watch statement.
	   The statement, faxed to The Associated Press in Belgrade, said
hundreds of others have been injured from beatings and torture,
often used to extract confessions.
	   Most ethnic Albanians want independence or substantial
self-rule, whereas Serbia, in its proposal for Kosovo released last
month, has offered only a degree of autonomy while keeping the
province firmly under Serbian control.
	   Washington, however, opposes full independence, fearing that
would lead to similar demands by other ethnic Albanian communities
elsewhere in the southern Balkans.
	   That in turn could destabilize what has historically been one of
Europe's most unstable regions.
	   Although fighting has all but ceased since the October accord,
there are fears that Kosovo will again explode unless a political
solution is found by spring.
	   Ivan Sedlak, an official on the Serbian negotiating team, said
the Serbian government has not studied Hill's latest plan. He said
the previous U.S. version was unacceptable because it defined
Kosovo virtually as a separate state.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Journalists covering street
demonstrations in Malaysia have been advised by the police to wear
name tags, stay behind police lines and follow instructions to
avoid being attacked by protesters.
	   Kuala Lumpur police chief Kamaruddin Mohd Ali made the
recommendations Tuesday in a meeting with executive council members
of Malaysia's National Union of Journalists.
	   Hong Boon How, general secretary of the journalists' union, said
his group had requested the meeting following a spate of incidents
last month in which reporters and photographers were harassed and
attacked by street demonstrators.
	   In one incident, a photographer was attacked by protesters who
mistook him for a plainclothes policeman.
	   Street demonstrations had been held during weekends, mostly in
the capital city by supporters of the anti-government reform
movement launched by the sacked deputy prime minister Anwar
Ibrahim.

 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES throughout with Albright quotes, Edits to
TRIM. No pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Updating NATO's guiding military and
political principles is not _ as critics contend _ an attempt to
create a ``global NATO'' far beyond the intent of the original
treaty, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Tuesday.
	   Foreign ministers from the 16-nation alliance met in Brussels to
lay the groundwork for April's 50th anniversary NATO summit in
Washington, where leaders are expected to approve the alliance's
strategy for the 21st century.
	   Today's threat is no longer a Russian tank assault across the
plains of Central Europe, but challenges from regional conflicts
like Bosnia and Kosovo, terrorism and the spread of weapons of mass
destruction.
	   In practice, NATO already has adjusted to these new realities,
intervening in Bosnia, halting the humanitarian disaster in Kosovo
with the threat of airstrikes, and stationing soldiers in Macedonia
to rescue Kosovo cease-fire monitors if needed.
	   ``We must be prepared because we know that events beyond NATO's
immediate borders can affect vital alliance interests,'' Albright
said. ``Common sense tells us that it is sometimes better to deal
with instability when it is still at arms length than to wait until
it is at our doorstep.''
	   NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said thinking beyond NATO's
traditional territory is nothing new. ``NATO is already acting out
of area, so let's not dramatize that,'' he said.
	   Albright responded to suggestions that assuming new missions
beyond collective European defense is tinkering with the original
North Atlantic Treaty: ``I've said it before; I will repeat it
again today: This is hogwash.''
	   ``I often remind people that a ballistic missile attack using a
weapon of mass destruction from a rogue state is every bit as much
a ... threat to our borders now as a Warsaw Pact tank was two
decades ago,'' she said.
	   At the meeting Tuesday, the allies assessed the situation in
Kosovo, where Serb security forces and ethnic Albanian guerrillas
clashed for seven months. The threat of NATO airstrikes stopped the
fighting in October and the cease-fire is generally holding, while
U.S. mediator Christopher Hill seeks a political agreement.
	   ``Kosovo is a critical test not only for NATO, but for Europe's
larger security structure,'' Albright said.
	   The foreign ministers agreed Tuesday not to cut the number of
troops in the NATO-led multinational peacekeeping force in Bosnia,
leaving the force at 32,000.
	   However, they warned in a statement that the Bosnia
Stabilization Force ``cannot be maintained indefinitely nor does it
reduce the responsibility of the authorities (in Bosnia) to ensure
the stability of their country.''
	   The ministers also said one of the key tasks for 1999 would be
to accelerate the return of Bosnian refugees.
	   German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer said adapting to change
has always been one of NATO's strong points.
	   ``One of the special qualities of the alliance has always been
its ability to react flexibly to new situations,'' he said. ``On
the eve of the 21st century we should ask ourselves if our
instruments still match the changed security environment.''
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook stressed the increased role
Europeans want to play in continental security, particularly in
cases where the United States is less interested in participating.
	   Solana said the EU, Europe's economic alliance, is changing and
NATO's plans must be adapted to the changes in the EU. ``We are
trying to reconcile these things.''
	   Albright proposed setting up a Center for Weapons of Mass
Destruction, essentially on how to best share and use intelligence.
The plan would use existing NATO headquarters staff under one
director, with perhaps a few extra experts.
	   The Germans planned to bring up the nuclear first-strike
question later in the meeting. Fischer made waves when he called on
NATO last month to consider dropping its doctrine allowing a
nuclear first-strike. The Germans don't have much backing on the
issue, however.

Ukrainian customs seize radioactive cargo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukrainian customs officials intercepted a
container with an unidentified radioactive material that a man from
neighboring Moldova tried to take out of Ukraine, a newspaper said
Tuesday.
	   The container was seized at the Ukrainian-Moldovan border during
a search of the Moldovan man's car, whose passengers included three
women and a child, the daily Dyen said. Customs officials searched
the car after receiving a warning from Ukraine's Security Service.
	   The sealed, 42-kilogram (92-pound) container was emitting
radiation at a level 12 times the maximum allowed by Ukrainian
health authorities, the newspaper said. No further details were
released.
	   Meanwhile, in a village in southern Ukraine, Malomykhailyvka,
police recently discovered a 100-kilogram (220-pound) lead box with
a metal-working device containing radioactive cesium, which had
been kept in storage by a 74-year-old villager.
	   The man said the box was brought to him four years ago by his
grandson and that he had no idea about its dangerous contents,
regional civil defense chief Oleksandr Sydoruk told Dyen.
	   Many containers of radioactive isotopes have disappeared from
metallurgy plants, hospitals and other facilities in the former
Soviet Union in recent years. Police say they attract thieves who
mistakenly think the material can be sold as nuclear technology.

	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Five supporters of Glasgow Rangers received
five-month suspended sentences following a drunken rampage through
the streets of Milan, the ANSA news agency said Tuesday.
	   The five, en route to Parma for the Scottish club's UEFA Cup
match, were arrested Sunday night. ANSA said they were convicted of
disorderly conduct and freed.
	   They reportedly broke windows of a restaurant and shop and
damaged about 30 cars.

First Division club manager in custody for allegedly embezzling
</HEADLINE>
dlrs 100,000

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ A top soccer official was detained by
police Tuesday, accused of embezzling dlrs 100,000 from his club
and other sources, the national news agency reported.
	   Vasile Boudi was dismissed as manager of FC Olimpia in the
northwest city of Satu Mare in October after he could not justify
expenses worth one half billion lei (dlrs 50,000) to the club's
administration board.
	   The club was promoted to the first division this season. After
the club was promoted, Boudi sold 13 players over a few months.
	   Police detained him Tuesday for allegedly stealing from the
``club, state budget and private persons,'' Rompres reported
without elaborating.
	   Police in Satu Mare, some 500 kilometers (312 miles) northwest
of Bucharest, have asked prosecutors to issue a 30-days arrest
warrant.
	   Since 1989 when communism ended, soccer has been plagued with
accusations of corruption and game rigging.

Ukrainian court dismisses appeal from soldier sentenced for hazing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A military court in Ukraine has dismissed
an appeal from a soldier sentenced to a prison term and a large
fine for beating to death a fellow serviceman, a newspaper reported
Tuesday.
	   Valeriy Nykonenko was found guilty of killing a new recruit,
Oleksandr Troianovsky, during a hazing session in June 1996, when
Mykonenko and other drunken soldiers attacked 18 younger comrades.
	   The practice of hazing of young recruits by elder soldiers is
widespread in the armies of the former Soviet republics.
	   Mykonenko was sentenced to eight years in prison and a fine of
10,000 hryvna (dlrs 2,920 at the current rate) to compensate the
killed soldier's relatives, Kievskiye Vedomosti reported.
	   But he refused to pay the fine and appealed to a military court,
which has dismissed the appeal. Mykonenko is considering an appeal
to the Supreme Court, the newspaper said.

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A newspaper headed by Iran's leading woman
activist Faezeh Hashemi, the daughter of former President Hashemi
Rafsanjani, was cleared of violating press rules, the Iran News

intelligence, the newspaper said.
	   It must still face a minor charge of printing a letter from one

Russian hard currency reserves fall 8 percent in a month
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout with tax revenues far behind plan, new oil
statistics, government expected to pass the budget, other details.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's hard currency reserves fell 8 percent
last month, drained by debt payments and efforts to prop up the
increasingly weak ruble, officials said today.
	   The Central Bank's reserves, which stood at $13.6 billion at the
start of November, shrank to $12.5 billion by the end of the month,
the Interfax news agency reported, quoting a bank announcement.
	   Reserves have dropped by nearly 30 percent since the start of
the year, the bank said.
	   The Central Bank spent reserves trying to halt the steady
decline of the ruble, which is now at more than 20 to the U.S.
dollar. Before the economic crisis hit in August, the ruble was
trading at around 6 to the dollar.
	   Since Russia's financial meltdown in August, the ruble has been
closely watched as a bellwether of economic confidence in the
country. Its steady dive has reflected fears that the government
will crank up the printing presses to pay domestic and foreign
debts _ almost certain to result in high inflation.
	   In other bad news, overall government revenues totaled $10.8
billion for the first 10 months of the year, or 59 percent of
target levels, the Finance Ministry said, according to the Interfax
news agency.
	   The government's chronic inability to meet tax collection and
revenue targets has been a serious stumbling block in its efforts
to reform the economy.
	   The International Monetary Fund and a group of other lenders put
together a $22.6 billion bailout package last summer, but only
released around $5 billion before freezing further installments.
	   Lenders want the government to come up with a viable budget
before resuming the loans. The IMF has criticized the earlier
government's blueprint as overly optimistic on revenues and heavy
with administrative controls over the economy.
	   After several delays, the Cabinet plans to pass the 1999 budget
on Thursday and will submit the document to the parliament soon
after, officials said. The budget will include bills aimed at
streamlining the country's unwieldy tax system.
	   In the past few years, the government and the parliament have
failed to finalize the budget before the start of the budget year,
further complicating the process.
	   However, First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov said today
he expects swift passage of the budget by the parliament this year.
Unlike previous Cabinets, the current government enjoys broad
support in the Communist-dominated State Duma, or lower house.
	   In other economic developments:
	   _ Russian crude oil production dropped 1 percent from January
through October, to 244.4 million metric tons, the State Statistics
Committee said.
	   _ Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir Bulgak called on the European
Union to revoke anti-dumping measures against Russian exports,
which cost Russia $300 million annually, the Interfax news agency
reported.

Scientists urge expanded research into cloning for disease

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Scientists advised the government Tuesday that
Britain should allow continued research into the cloning of human
embryos for the treatment of disease, but should uphold the ban on
its use for creating babies.
	   The experts were asked in January to advise on the legal and
ethical implications of the technology after Scottish scientists
created the world's first cloned mammal, Dolly the sheep, by
cloning a cell from an adult sheep in 1996.
	   British law bans human reproductive cloning _ whereby the
genetic information in an egg is replaced with that from another
cell and then reinserted in the womb _ and restricts research
conducted on human embryos for medical purposes.
	   Embryos less than 14 days old may only be used for research into
the treatment of infertility and congenital disease, but research
cannot be aimed at developing replacement tissue.
	   The scientists at the Human Fertilization and Embryology
Authority and the Human Genetics Advisory Committee advised that
the purposes for which research can be carried out be extended to
include tissue growth, and suggested policy should be reviewed in
five years time.
	   That recommendation followed research from the United States
where scientists have succeeded in isolating and growing cultures
of human embryonic stem cells _ the undeveloped ``parents'' of all
the tissues in the body.
	   It is hoped this could lead to the growth of replacement tissue
in laboratories from cells taken from patients, avoiding the
problems of transplant rejection.
	   The recommendations drew praise from other scientists, but
condemnation from those who fear cloning for medical treatment will
inevitably lead to the creation of identical copies of human
beings.
	   Dr. Harry Griffin, assistant director at the Roslin Institute in
Edinburgh, which created Dolly, applauded the report's position
rejecting reproductive cloning.
	   ``We are also pleased that the report recognizes that there are
other applications of cloning in human medicine that have great
potential to benefit mankind,'' he said. ``The use of cloning in
cell therapy promises to provide radical new treatments for a
number of common diseases like Parkinson's, diabetes and strokes.''
	   But Patrick Dixon, author of ``Futurewise,'' a book which warns
of the dangers of unrestrained research, said: ``This is the
perfect Christmas present for those who want to press ahead with
human cloning.''
	   He called for an international moratorium on such research.
	   The government will respond to the report early next year, the
Health Department said.
	   Last week, U.N. officials called for a universal code of ethics
for cloning and genetic engineering.
	   In the United States, a five-year moratorium announced by
President Bill Clinton to ban cloning has apparently been observed
by most mainstream scientists, although Congress has failed to act
on the legislation.

German economic institute criticizes ECB's monetary policies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ An influential German economic
institute on Tuesday criticized the European Central Bank, which
will set monetary policy for the 11 nations launching the euro
currency Jan. 1.
	   German Institute for Economic Research chief economist Gustav
Horn was quoted Tuesday in the Berlin daily newspaper Die Welt as
saying that the new central bank is ``taking the wrong direction,''
and that its policies would have a negative impact on the economy
and jobs picture.
	   He said the unified interest rate of 3 percent, set in a
dramatic coordinated drop of rates in all 11 countries last week,
was too high, calling instead for 2.5 percent.
	   Horn also called for looser money supply policies. The ECB's M3
money supply is set to grow at an annualized rate of 4.5 percent;
Horn wants it at 5.5 percent.
	   The independent institute was run until recently by Heiner
Flassbeck, now Germany's deputy finance minister under Oskar
Lafontaine. Lafontaine led a German-French campaign for lower
interest rates to boost the economy and create jobs, seen by many
as a challenge to the bank's independence. Bankers emphasized they
lowered the rates due to sluggish growth _ not politics.
	   The 11 countries launching the euro are Austria, Belgium,
Ireland, Italy, Finland, France, Germany, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, Spain and Portugal.

	   LYON, France (AP) _ Seven cyclists from the Casino cycling team
are being questioned by French authorities investigating the doping
scandal that overshadowed the Tour de France, judicial sources said
Tuesday.
	   Police from Lille, where judge Patrick Keil is investigating
doping at the disgraced Festina team, traveled to Lyon to question
the cyclists, said judicial sources on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   The cyclists, who were not named, are expected to leave police
headquarters in Lyon this afternoon, after being detained for about
24 hours.
	   During the Tour, Casino cyclist Rodolfo Massi was put under
formal investigation, one stage short of being charged, for
breaking French anti-doping laws.

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe _ President Robert Mugabe on Tuesday slipped
past demonstrators protesting his authoritarian rule to address a
worldwide Christian convention.
	   About a dozen foreign human rights and gay activists from
Europe, Asia and the United States waved banners calling for the
recognition of homosexual rights, and alleging that Mugabe has
curbed democratic freedoms in Zimbabwe.
	   One banner called for the withdrawal of 8,000 Zimbabwean troops
deployed in the Congo to support embattled President Laurent
Kabila, who is widely accused of violating human rights.
	   Mugabe, a practicing Roman Catholic who returned to the faith
after years as a Marxist, was speaking to the eighth assembly of
the World Council of Churches, representing 450 million non-Roman
Catholic Christians.
	   He urged the body to use its ``moral authority'' to press for
debt relief for developing countries in ``a heartless world
dominated by bullies.''
	   ``Rich nations trample on poor ones with disgusting impunity,''
he said.
	   Uniformed police formed a human barrier to drive back the
protesters from Mugabe, whose hold on power faces its greatest
threat from worsening economic hardships. The hardships have
triggered civil unrest and food riots.
	   Earlier this month, Mugabe used sweeping presidential powers to
ban strikes protesting his policies, alleged corruption and
military spending in the Congo at a time health, education and
social services are deteriorating sharply at home.
	   Labor groups have applied to the nation's highest court to
declare the ban a breach of constitutional rights of free
expression and movement.
	   Delegates and observers from 112 countries are in Harare for the
meeting, which has already been marked by clashes between
conservative and liberal clerics over the recognition of
homosexuality and the interpretation of Christian doctrines.
	   WCC President Vinton Anderson of the U.S. African Methodist
Episcopal Church said Mugabe's ``penchant for human rights and
sense of Christianity is sufficiently broad to include all the
children of God.''
	   He did not allude to Mugabe's repeated attacks on homosexuals,
and said he would pray for Mugabe's administration as `` a godly
model for all to follow.''
	   Mugabe has described same-sex partners as ``lower than pigs and
dogs.''
	   Though he did not mention homosexuality in his address to the
assembly, Mugabe told reporters afterward homosexuals violated
African culture ``and if they want to live that lifestyle they can
come here and be purged.''
	   Homosexual acts are illegal in Zimbabwe.
	   Mugabe praised Christian churches for their support in helping
blacks win independence from white rule in the former British
colony of Rhodesia, as Zimbabwe was known before 1980.
	   He singled out former President Canaan Banana, a Methodist
minister who fled Zimbabwe last month after being convicted of
sodomy and homosexual assault charges, the Rev. Ndabaningi Sithole
and Bishop Abel Muzorewa.
	   Sithole, leader of a small opposition party, is currently free
on bail waiting to appeal a two-year prison sentence for plotting a
failed attempt to assassinate Mugabe in 1995 and Muzorewa leads
another opposition group that has accused Mugabe of corruption,
misrule and human rights abuse.

Huyu rebels kill 25 people
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUJUMBURA, Burundi (AP) _ Hutu rebels killed 25 people and
injured others in an attack on a camp for civilians displaced by
war south of the capital, a military spokesman said Tuesday.
	   Col. Mammert Sinarinzi said that on Monday night rebels attacked
the camp for displaced Hutu civilians in Rumonge commune, 80
kilometers (50 miles) south of the capital, Bujumbura.
	   The rebels killed 25 civilians and injured others. The army
pursued the assailants and killed four of them, also capturing two
guns, Sinarinzi said.
	   No other details about the attack were available.
	   The rebels often attack Hutu civilians they believe are
collaborating with the Tutsi-led army and government.
	   Sinarinzi said rebels had been spotted on the move in five
provinces in southern, western and northwestern Burundi last week
after many returned recently from Tanzania and war-torn neighboring
Congo.
	   Hutu rebels attacks and army retaliations have killed more than
200,000 people in Burundi since 1993, when Tutsi paratroopers
assassinated the country's first democratically elected president,
a Hutu.

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Saying Israel failed to fulfill
agreements, Poland on Tuesday rejected a deal to arm its Huzar
helicopter with Israeli-made missiles, Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek
said.
	   Making the announcement after a weekly Cabinet meeting, Buzek
said the deal announced last year was rejected because ``Israel has
failed to hold tests in Poland of the missile that we were to
buy.''
	   He also cited objections raised by the government auditing
agency over the handling of a tender for a separate deal involving
integrating systems for the Huzar helicopter. An Israeli company
also won that contract.
	   Buzek called the missile deal that Poland's previous leftist
government signed with Israel a preliminary agreement and said
scrapping it will have no legal or financial consequences, the
state news agency PAP reported.
	   The decision by Poland adds to a list of disputes with Israel.
Earlier this year, the Israeli government-run Yad Vashem Holocaust
museum formally complained to Poland's government about crosses
erected on a property adjoining the Auschwitz Nazi death camp, now
a museum.
	   On Monday, Poland announced that Israel refused to extradite a
Polish Jew who allegedly committed atrocities against German
prisoners in 1945.
	   Poland's pending membership in NATO, the Western military
alliance, may have influenced its decision to reject the Israeli
missile deal. The former Polish government, which lost power in
elections last year, chose the Israeli company Rafael over the U.S.
company Boeing for the missile deal.
	   Buzek, however, said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
agreed to terms for testing the missiles during a visit to Poland
in April.
	   Poland wanted to test the missiles in Polish weather and terrain
by the end of November, but Buzek said Israel asked to postpone the
tests for eight months, which he called ``unacceptable.''
	   Following five years of negotiating with several potential
partners, Poland last year awarded the dlrs 800 million contract to
Israel's Rafael and Elbit Systems Ltd. companies to equip the Huzar
helicopters in line with NATO requirements.
	   Under the deal, which required approval from both governments,
Rafael was to supply the Huzar with anti-tank NTD missiles and
Elbit was to provide electronic integrating systems.
	   But Poland's Solidarity-led government, which took office
shortly after the agreement was signed, criticized the handling of
the tenders by its ex-communist predecessors and demanded missile
tests. It also decided to seek another tender for the integrating
systems, but has set no date for it.
	   Buzek said the government will continue its plan to arm the
Polish-made Huzar.

Clashes in West Bank, Netanyahu under pressure to freeze accord

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ New clashes erupted Tuesday in the West Bank
while domestic pressure mounted on Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu to abandon the Wye River land-for-security agreement with
the Palestinians.
	   The violence and Israel's political turmoil came just five days
before the start of U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit to Israel
and the Palestinian areas.
	   The trip, which begins Sunday after Clinton's midnight arrival,
was intended to shore up the Wye agreement and restore calm to the
region, but appeared to be having the opposite effect.
	   In Gaza City, armored personnel carriers were deployed outside
the convention center where Clinton is to address 1,500 Palestinian
delegates next week. Later in the week, streets around the hall
will be sealed.
	   The Palestinians have presented a plan for protecting Clinton to
U.S. Secret Service agents in Gaza and the United States, in turn,
has given the Palestinians sophisticated bomb detection devices.
	   The Islamic militant group Hamas has not openly threatened the
president. However, it is bent on derailing U.S. peace effort and
has carried out more than a dozen suicide bombings in Israel.
	   In three separate West Bank clashes, Palestinians threw stones
at Israeli troops and motorists. In the town of Ram, north of
Jerusalem, soldiers fired tear gas and rubber bullets at high
school students, injuring four. In the Kalandia refugee, troops
fired rubber bullets after their jeep was stoned and an officer was
lightly injured. Near biblical Bethlehem, an 11-year-old Israeli
girl was hurt when stones struck the car she was riding in.
	   Tensions in the Palestinian areas have been running high in
recent days because of the dispute with Israel over releases of
Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails. The Palestinians hope
that Clinton will back up demands that as part of the Wye accord,
Israel release more Palestinians held for anti-Israeli activities.
	   Also Tuesday, dozens of Jewish settlers protested outside
Netanyahu's office after assailants, apparently Palestinians,
wounded a West Bank settler in a drive-by shooting late Monday.
	   The victim is a resident of the Ganim settlement, one of several
that became isolated enclaves after Israel withdrew troops from 2
percent of the West Bank in the first stage of the Wye agreement.
	   ``Only 17 days have passed since the withdrawal and already they
are shooting at us,'' read a sign held up by protesters.
	   In a Jerusalem hospital, a 21-year-old Palestinian university
student, Nasr Erekat, remained hooked up to life support after
being shot in a clash with an Israeli civilian and soldiers.
	   Erekat is a cousin of the chief Palestinian peace negotiator,
Saeb Erekat, who accused Netanyahu of triggering new violence by
suspending the upcoming Israeli troop pullback in the West Bank
until Arafat meets a number of demands.
	   As part of the Wye agreement, five percent of the land is to be
transferred from Israeli control to joint jurisdiction next week.
	   Erekat said Netanyahu's decision ``has to do with his survival
as prime minister and the survival of his coalition,'' not with
alleged Palestinian violations of the accord.
	   An official close to Netanyahu, speaking on condition of
anonymity, also said the prime minister's toughened stance was
aimed mainly at preventing the fall of his government.
	   Israeli media have said that when Netanyahu announced the
suspension, ostensibly because of a Palestinian attack on an
Israeli soldier, he had already made a secret deal with coalition
hard-liners to freeze the peace accord. In exchange, the
hard-liners agreed to withdraw support for an early elections bill.
	   On Monday, when the bill came up for a first of three readings,
Netanyahu still did not have enough support. In a desperate move to
buy time, Netanyahu had a coalition partner, the United Torah
Front, seek a no-confidence vote in his own government, thus
postponing the decision on early elections by two weeks.
	   Israeli commentators said Tuesday that until then, Netanyahu
will do everything in his power to win back the hawkish renegades.
	   However, their minimal price is a written Netanyahu promise that
he will walk away from the Wye agreement for good. Netanyahu
``allowed himself to become a hostage of the right wing,''
commentator Nahum Barnea wrote in the Yediot Ahronot daily.
	   On the other hand, Netanyahu's battle for political survival
coincides with the Clinton visit during which he will come under
intense U.S. pressure to keep his side of the peace agreement.

	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ A 25-year-old British
engineer, serving the multinational NATO-led peace force in Bosnia,
died Tuesday when he was crushed between two armored personnel
carriers, a NATO official said.
	   A statement said the accident occurred Tuesday at Mrkonjic Grad,
some 120 kilometers northwest of Sarajevo. The victim's name was
not released.
	   A military police investigation is now under way to establish
how the accident occurred and no further comments will be made
until this is completed, NATO said.

Brezhnev's grandson wants statue to Andropov, another ex-KGB chief

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ They all want a statue to a Soviet secret police
chief in the center of Moscow, but Russia's Communists are divided
on the question of which one.
	   The Communist-dominated State Duma, the lower house of
parliament, has asked the Moscow city government to return the
statue of Felix Dzerzhinsky, the head of the first Soviet secret
police, to the spot it occupied for decades in front of the old KGB
headquarters.
	   On Tuesday, a new proposal was made.
	   The grandson of late Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev and leader of
a small Communist movement said a statue to Dzerzhinsky wasn't a
good idea.
	   Instead, the younger Brezhnev wants a statue to Yuri Andropov _
an infamous, longtime head of the KGB secret police who later
succeeded Leonid Brezhnev to lead the Soviet Union.
	   ``While the sculpture of Dzerzhinsky ... is still causing a
split in society, a monument to Andropov, who was chief of the KGB
for 15 years and subsequently led the Soviet Communist Party, will
not cause emotions to run so high,'' Andrei Brezhnev was quoted as
saying by the Interfax news agency.
	   The towering bronze statue of ``Iron Felix'' Dzerzhinsky on
Lyubyank Square was a landmark during the Soviet era. It was
toppled by pro-democracy protesters in 1991 and has since
languished with other Soviet-era statues in a city park.
	   ``I think that without a monument Lubyanka Square has lost its
architectural completeness,'' Andrei Brezhnev said.
	   The parliament's proposal to resurrect the statue to Dzerzhinsky
is non-binding, as the city legislature must approve all decisions
on monuments.
	   The Communists are the leading faction in parliament, but are
much less influential in the Moscow city parliament, which may
block the move to restore the statue.
	   Human rights activists have denounced the proposal, saying
Dzerzhinsky was a symbol of murderous repression during the Soviet
era.
	   Dzerzhinsky headed the secret police after the Bolshevik
Revolution and oversaw ruthless crackdowns on political opponents.
The square where his statue stood is used by human rights groups
for vigils to honor the millions of victims of Soviet rule.
	   The younger Brezhnev made his political debut this fall when he
set up the All-Russia Communist Socio-Political Movement, riding a
wave of public nostalgia about the stability of the Soviet times.
	   He said he may run for Russia's presidency in 2000, and his
movement will participate in parliamentary elections next year.

Bulgaria to increase civil control over police
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Bulgaria will increase civil control over
police in a step to eradicate corruption and misuse of powers, the
interior minister said Tuesday.
	   Bogomil Bonev said he would propose to parliament legal
amendments that would allow him have a team of aides in charge of
civil control over officers.
	   People would be able to file complaints from police at special
offices that would be independent from local police directorates,
Bonev added.
	   Other draft legislation would toughen punishments for
mistreatment of detainees and illegal use of force, Bonev said.
	   ``The (Bulgarian) police must become an armed civil
administration as it is all over Europe,'' Bonev said. ``We must
eradicate the mentality that the uniform gives exceptional powers
and teach the police that their chief duty is to help people.''
	   He added the measures were prompted by piling reports of
policemen misusing their powers to extort money from civilians.
Scores of officers have been fired and tried on blackmail charges
since the current government launched an anti-corruption campaign.

U.S. envoy praises moderate Bosnian Serb politician, slams the
</HEADLINE>
hard-liner
 &UR; By AIDA CERKEZ-ROBINSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ After sharply criticizing
the hardline Bosnian Serb president, the U.S. envoy to Bosnia on
Tuesday praised another moderate Bosnian Serb for his
``constructive role'' in rebuilding the country.
	   Robert Gelbard met with the Bosnian Serb member of the
collective national presidency, Zivko Radisic, about ways to
modernize the economy and encourage foreign investment.
	   Gelbard called the talks ``constructive'' and added: ``I
certainly feel that President Radisic has played a very important
and positive role since he joined the joint presidency.''
	   Those comments were in sharp contrast to Gelbard's remarks about
the hardline president of the Bosnian Serb republic, Nikola
Poplasen.
	   On Monday, Gelbard said the United States was ``deeply concerned
about what we have seen so far from President Poplasen and his
short few weeks in office.''
	   Poplasen's ``actions and his words have shown us that he is
against the Dayton agreement,'' Gelbard told reporters, referring
to the 1995 accord which ended the Bosnian war in 1995. ``He
appears to be using democratic mechanism for antidemocratic
purposes.''
	   As Bosnian Serb president, Poplasen has the authority to propose
a prime minister for the Bosnian Serbs. Poplasen opposes
renominating Milorad Dodik or another moderate favored by the West.
	   ``There is no question in my mind that he is using the process
of being able to nominate the prime minister as a way to maintain
uncertainty,'' in the Bosnian Serb republic, Gelbard said.
	   According to the Dayton agreement, Bosnia is divided in two
halves, one ruled by the Bosnian Serbs and the other shared by the
Muslim and Croats. Both entities are linked by common institutions
such as the collective presidency.
	   International efforts to bring the entities closer have often
been obstructed by hardliners who prefer to see the country
completely divided.
	   Following the meeting with Gelbard, Radisic promised to speed
the work of the joint presidency and said foreign support will be
welcome in his work.
	   ``We don't have time any more and neither do we have the
patience to constantly refer to the past,'' Radisic said. ``For
three years we've been living in peace and it is time now to start
a fast economic restruction,'' he added.

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The price index of the Kuwait Stock Exchange
closed at 1,633.8 points Tuesday, dipping for the second day below
the 1,700 psychological barrier amid fears the market has started a
free fall.
	   The problem has been aggravated by a disagreement between the
Central Bank and a ministerial committee over what caused the
prices to fall over the past weeks and how the problem should be
dealt with.
	   The committee believes the market needs liquidity, and the
Central Bank does not want to allow any steps to be taken to pump
funds into the market before thorough studies are completed.
	   Al-Anba daily urged the government on Tuesday to take ``a
decision, any decision, to stop this bleeding that will lead to the
financial ruin of scores of companies and tens of thousands of
citizens.''
	   The headline of the daily's economy page warned the index has
``entered the phase of free fall.''
	   KSE lists 77 companies and is the country's main venue for local
investments.
 &UR; ___
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egypt and Saudi Arabia started discussions
Tuesday on enhancing energy cooperation that will also include
connecting their electricity grids, a newspaper said.
	   The talks headed by Egypt's Electricity Minister Maher Abaza and
his Saudi counterpart, Hisham Al-Yamani, will also focus on
utilizing non-conventional methods of producing energy such as
solar and wind, the Egyptian Gazette said.
	   Saudi Arabia and its five partners in the Gulf Cooperation
Council are building a unified power grid, which they hope to
connect later with an Arab power network. The Arab grid is planned
to be connected with that in Europe via Libya, Tunisia, Algeria and
Morocco.
	   The Gazette said al-Yamani will brief Abaza on progress made in
the building of the Gulf grid and the time schedule for its
completion.
	   The project will help transfer electricity power among the
participating countries and save tremendous investments in power
generating plants.
	   In a related development, the opposition Al-Wafd newspaper said
the project received a setback after Libya refused to continue work
in the project to link its power grid with Egypt.
	   Al-Wafd said Libya has banned Egyptian firms working on the
project to continue the construction although it had already
received a dlrs 40 million loan from a Gulf fund to finance the
unified grid.
 &UR; ___
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Japan agreed on Tuesday to assist Jordan in
building a new bridge across the Jordan River to replace the
rickety Allenby Bridge linking the Kingdom with the West Bank.
	   Allenby was rebuilt months after Arab armies destroyed it in the
six-day Arab-Israeli War in June 1967 to prevent Israeli troop
advancement to the east bank of the Jordan River.
	   But the one-lane wooden bridge has become unable to handle
increased traffic with the West Bank and Israel following peace
agreements between the three sides.
	   A Japanese Embassy statement said details of the project, such
as its cost and Japan's share in the financing, will be determined
in negotiations to be held once the bridge sketches are completed.
It did not disclose a date.
	   It said the new bridge, 58 kilometers (35 miles) southwest of
the Jordanian capital Amman, will ``remarkably contribute to
economic and social activities in the region, especially between
Jordan and the West Bank.''
	   Japan has made similar contributions to Jordan. In 1996, it paid
dlrs 7 million for the construction of a bridge in the north,
linking the kingdom with Israel.
 &UR; ___
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran will need dlrs 7.9 billion from foreign
sources and buy-back schemes to implement various projects in the
current and next year's budget, the governor of Central Bank of
Iran, Mohsen Nourbakhsh, said Monday.
	   The two budgets, including the next one beginning March 21,
predict dlrs 5.4 billion worth of buy-back schemes in the oil, gas,
industries, mines, and metals sectors, he told reporters.
	   The remaining dlrs 2.5 billion worth of foreign facilities
envisaged in the budgets will be paid back out of the profits from
the projects, Nourbakhsh said.
	   He added that the inflation rate is less than 20 percent this
year and is estimated to be 23-24 percent next year.

	   GENOA, Italy (AP) _ Argentine soccer star Ariel Ortega and two
Sampdoria teammates have been suspended following a drunken driving
incident and won't play in Rome Sunday against Lazio, the Genoa
team said Tuesday.
	   Ortega was cited by police for drunk driving and Fernando
Cordoba, also Argentine, for drunkenness.
	   Police took no action was taken against a third player in the
car, Brazilian Cate.
	   But club official Domenico Arnuzzo said none of the three will
make the trip to Rome for the Lazio match and that the club is also
considering fines.

Report: Algerian authorities have found 35 bodies in orchard
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Algerian authorities have found a total of 35
bodies in an orchard on the outskirts of Algiers and suspect they
were killed by Islamic militants, a newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   According to the El Watan newspaper, emergency workers have been
removing the cadavers from an unused well for the past two weeks.
On Monday, the paper said, they removed ten bodies and they warned
that the number of cadavers in the well could be at least 200.
	   El Watan said the victims had been killed by the Armed Islamic
Group, the GIA, the most radical insurgency movement trying to oust
the military-backed government.
	   Bodies were originally found at the orchard last month when
local residents alerted authorities of a terrible smell coming from
the well near Meftah, about (20 kilometers) 12 miles from the
center of Algiers.
	   Last week, emergency workers also removed a bottle filled with
explosives from the well, remnants from a bomb building operation
that existed at the farm from 1993 to 1996, when the GIA used the
area as a transit zone, El Watan reported.
	   More than 75,000 people have died since the insurgency began in
1992 after the government canceled elections the Islamic Salvation
Front was expected to win.

Europeans urge Olympic ban on countries lax on drugs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A group of European nations is urging the IOC to
ban countries from the Olympics if they don't have adequate
out-of-competition drug testing programs.
	   ``Only those countries which agree to out-of-competition testing
should compete at the Olympics,'' said David Hemery, pressident of
UK Athletics, Britain's governing body of track and field.
	   Hemery attended a meeting in Frankfurt of leading members of the
European Athletic Association. He gave Britain's backing to a
letter sent to the International Olympic Committee by Helmut Digel,
president of the German track federation, seeking sanctions against
non-conforming countries.
	   ``We should hit them where it hurts the most,'' Hemery said.
``Television and other IOC revenues should be given only to
countries that support out-of-competition testing.''
	   Hemery singled out China as a country at which the measure was
aimed. Chinese swimmers and track and field athletes have been
caught up in a string of doping scandals in recent years, but IOC
president Juan Antonio Samaranch said Monday that China's
anti-doping efforts were ``an example'' for the rest of the world.
	   ``I will say that maybe China is today one of the countries
fighting with all their strength against doping and that is quite
important to us,'' Samaranch said in Bangkok during the Asian
Games. ``We think the fight against doping in China is a real
example.''
	   Hemery said Digel does not expect to succeed with his
controversial proposal to scrap all existing track and field world
records and start with a clean slate in 2000. Digel contends that
many records are tainted by suspicion of drug use, but IAAF
president Primo Nebiolo has described the idea as impractical.

Iran reportedly recruiting ex-Soviet bio weapons experts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Iran has recruited ex-Soviet germ warfare
scientists for jobs in Tehran, with at least some of them being
asked to work on a clandestine biological weapons program, The New
York Times reported Tuesday.
	   Officials with ties to Iran's top leadership have approached
more than a dozen Russian biological warfare experts with high
salary offers, the Times said, quoting Russian scientists and U.S.
officials.
	   Though most of the biologists declined the offer, at least five
had accepted as much as dlrs 5,000 a month to work in Iran, far
more than most could make in a year in Russia, the report said,
citing Russian scientists.
	   The counselor to Iran's mission to the United Nations,
Gholamhossein Dehghani, ``categorically rejected'' the claim that
Iran is seeking to hire Russian germ warfare experts, the Times
said.
	   He cited his country's ratification of the 1972 international
treaty banning biological weapons.
	   In interviews conducted by the Times in Russia and neighboring
Kazakstan, two scientists told the Times that they were
specifically asked to help Iran develop biological weapons.
	   American officials say many more Russian scientists have
disclosed such contacts and believe that Iran is developing a germ
arsenal, the Times said.
	   Officials who worked in the once-secret Soviet and U.S. germ
warfare programs were quoted as saying that it is difficult to
distinguish between pharmaceutical research and weapons
development.
	   Russia's program, which is thought to have developed anthrax and
smallpox weapons, employed some 70,000 scientists and technicians
at its height.

China's Yang breaks world records in women's lifting

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Yang Xia broke the world records for
clean and jerk and total lift Tuesday as she won gold for China in
women's 53-kilogram weightlifting at the Asian Games.
	   Yang's 120 kilograms in the clean and jerk broke the mark of
117.5 set by China's Wang Xiufen last month. Her total of 212.5
also eclipsed a mark set by Wang _ 210.0.
	   Taiwan's Li Feng-ying won the silver with a total of 202.5, and
Myanmar's Swe Swe Win took bronze with 197.5. Indonesia's Supeni
also lifted 197.5, but missed a medal because of heavier body
weight.
	   Yang lifted her 120 clean and jerk on her second attempt, and
did not try a third lift after her coach suggested the record was
good enough.
	   It was China's second world record of these games. On Monday,
Liu Xiuhua lifted 83.5 in the snatch of the women's 48-kilogram
division, beating the world mark of 83 set by compatriot Li Zhuo on
Sept. 16.
	   Le Maosheng gave China a second win from the two events Tuesday
with victory in the 62-kilogram division, but his attempt at
breaking his own Asian record failed.
	   Le increased the weight in a big jump from 165 to 180.5 kilos in
the second attempt during the clean and jerk. His failure left him
on 305 overall, 10 less than his Asian record.
	   Kazakstan's Dmitry Lomakin won the silver with 287.5 while
Japan's Hiroshi Ikehata was third, also with 287.5.

Russian lawmakers again stall on nuclear disarmament treaty
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Leads throughout to UPDATE with leftist leader agreeing to
support treaty. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's parliament again postponed discussions on
the START II treaty today after failing to meet a deadline for
sending a related measure on nuclear weapons to President Boris
Yeltsin.
	   The parliament's agenda-setting body, the Duma Council, had
planned today to review a bill outlining Russia's nuclear weapons
program.
	   But it delayed debate because no parliamentary factions except
the liberal Yabloko party submitted proposals or suggestions for
the measure, the Interfax news agency said.
	   Russia's Communist-led parliament has repeatedly delayed action
on the START II treaty, signed by the United States and Russia in
1993.
	   The lawmakers want an additional measure outlining the country's
nuclear weapons program before they act on the treaty.
	   The START II treaty would halve the Russian and American nuclear
arsenals to about 3,000 to 3,500 warheads each.
	   Yabloko leaders accused Communists in the parliament of once
again stalling on the treaty, which the U.S. Senate ratified in
1996.
	   Yeltsin and other proponents of ratification say the missiles
that would be destroyed under START-II will soon be out of date
anyway.
	   One positive note was sounded today when Nikolai Kharitonov, a
leader of the Communist-allied Agrarian Party, said he had changed
his mind about the treaty after a meeting with Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov, and now supported it.
	   ``As things stand now, ratification is in Russia's interest,''
Kharitonov said, according to the Interfax news agency. He
suggested that Russia could enhance its prospects for Western
financial aid by ratifying the accord.

 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS Elofsson and Tobias spelling throughout &QL; 
 &UR; By PIERO VALSECCHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Mathias Fredriksson knocked out his brother
Tobias in the semifinal round on his way to victory in a ski cross
country sprint event Tuesday which vaulted him atop the World Cup
standings.
	   The first ever victory in the yearly competition gave the
25-year-old Swede 150 points and the overall lead after two races.
	   Fredriksson had placed fourth in the season opener at Muonio,
Finland, a 10-kilometer freestyle race won by his teammate Per
Elofsson last month.
	   Elofsson was eliminated in the very first round at the Milan
meet.
	   Fredriksson won the two-way sprint final against Peter
Schlickenrieder when his German opponent took the wrong way in the
next-to-last of four laps while surprisingly leading the favored
Swede.
	   Also the women's final, won by Norway's Anita Moen-Guidon, was
decided by a mishap.
	   Slovenian Andreja Mali fell a few meters from the finish line,
while trying to fight off the strong comeback of the Norwegian
skier.
	   Italian favorite Stefania Belmondo fell and was eliminated in
the first round of sprints.
	   Tobias Fredriksson, who lost the semifinal following a
shoulder-to-shoulder duel with his brother, still earned the podium
by beating Norway's Odd-Bjorn Hjelmeset for third place.
	   Another Norwegian, Tor Arne Hetland, placed fifth ahead of Ari
Pololahti, the Finnish winner of the Milan sprint race last year.
	   Pololahti was also victim of a mistake when he headed toward the
finish line one lap too soon.
	   The sprint races were held at an indoor area usually hosting the
Milan ready-to-wear fashion shows in spring and autumn.
	   Skiers competed on artificial snow over four laps, for a
distance of one kilometer.
	   Mathias Fredriksson said he was surprised with his victory and
with his semifinal success against his brother.
	   ``Normally Tobias is faster in sprints ... In this kind of race
you must be lucky to start in front and take good turns,'' he said.
	   The Swedish skier added things may change quickly atop the World
Cup standings, beginning with the next races scheduled at Toblach
(Dobbiaco), Italy, this weekend.
	   Tuesday's victory, also a first for Moen-Guidon, gave the
Norwegian skier second place in the women's overall standings at
114 points, behind Katerina Neumannova.
	   Neumannova, a Czech, piled up 140 points from a victory in
Muonio and fourth place in Tuesday's sprint.
	   Moen-Guidon said she was lucky to win.
	   ``When I saw her falling I was happy to be first ... I always
thought it was not finished before the line,'' Moen-Guidon said.
	   Tuesday's sprints were deserted by Russian athletes and by
Norwegian great Bjorn Dahlie.

Prosecutor to demand halt to Belgrade court's massacre probe
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ International war crimes
prosecutors want to stop a Yugoslav military court's investigation
into the role of three former Serb officers in a notorious 1991
massacre.
	   Prosecutors from the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal will ask
judges on Wednesday to order Belgrade authorities to stop an
investigation of the massacre and hand over any evidence they have
collected.
	   Former Yugoslav People's Army officers Mile Mrksic, Veselin
Slijvancanin and Miroslav Radic are due to testify on Dec. 17 as
part of the investigation.
	   Tribunal Chief Prosecutor Louise Arbour accused Belgrade of
setting up show proceedings as a way of preventing the three from
being extradited for trial before the U.N. court in The Hague.
	   Given Yugoslavia's track record of defying the tribunal, the
case appears ``designed to shield the accused from international
criminal responsibility,'' Arbour wrote in documents released
Tuesday.
	   The officers were indicted by the tribunal in 1995 for allegedly
ordering the massacre of 260 non-Serbs taken out of a hospital in
the Croatian city of Vukovar in November 1991.
	   Under the tribunal's statute, national courts must defer cases
to the tribunal if judges in The Hague order them to do so.
	   Yugoslavia steadfastly refuses to extradite the so-called
``Vukovar Three,'' despite international arrest warrants and
pressure from the Security Council.
	   Belgrade authorities accuse the tribunal of being anti-Serb and
claim that their constitution bars extraditing the officers. Serbia
is the dominant republic in Yugoslavia.

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A newspaper headed by Iran's leading woman
activist, the daughter of former President Hashemi Rafsanjani, was
cleared of violating press rules, a newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   A court on Monday ruled that the Zan newspaper, run by Faezeh
Hashemi, was innocent of charges levied by the head of police
intelligence, the newspaper Iran News reported.
	   Zan still faces a minor charge of printing a letter from a
reader, who compared the official's bringing a court case against

Alex Miller out at last-place Aberdeen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ABERDEEN, Scotland (AP) _ Alex Miller's troubled reign as
Aberdeen manager ended Tuesday as he parted company with the
last-place Scottish Premier League club.
	   Aberdeen chairman Stewart Milne said Miller's departure was
decided by ``mutual consent'' and was ``in the best interests of
the club.''
	   Miller, the 49-year-old Scotland assistant manager, took over at
Aberdeen in November 1997. A former Glasgow Rangers star, he had
previous managerial stints at St. Mirren and Hibernian and was
assistant at Coventry.
	   Miller came under increasing fire from fans after another season
of poor performances.
	   He has presided over a disastrous run of just one win in 16
games that has seen his side slump to the bottom of the Premier
League.
	   A 3-0 home defeat to Dundee United 10 days ago was followed by
last Saturday's humiliating 4-0 defeat at Kilmarnock.
	   Milne said assistant boss Paul Hegarty and director of football
Keith Burkinshaw will run the team on an interim basis, while the
board searces for a long-term replacement.

Unemployment up, labor office cites unseasonable cold
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with comment on jobs creation talks &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Germany's persistently high
joblessness remained below 4 million in November for the third
straight month, though the unemployment rate rose slightly, to 10.2
percent, the Labor Office in Nuremberg reported Tuesday.
	   Nationwide, 3.95 million people were jobless, 54,300 more than
in October, when Germany reached its lowest unemployment rate _
10.1 percent _ in two years.
	   The seasonally adjusted rise of 4,000 jobs was far above
analysts' expectations. But Labor Office chief Bernhard Jagoda said
the numbers did not signal a turn for the worse in the German labor
market.
	   ``If December doesn't present any surprises we'll see the 1998
average jobless slightly below 4.3 million at the end of the
year,'' Jagoda said.
	   Jagoda blamed the dip on unseasonably cold weather and a slowing
of jobs-creation policies that were credited with easing the rate
in September and October. He did not rule out that harsh weather
conditions could again adversely affect the employment picture in
December.
	   Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's own jobs creations policies got
their first test with a meeting Monday night of union, industry and
political leaders to brainstorm on strategies to bring down
unemployment.
	   The talks resulted with a pledge to lower taxes for business and
improve early retirement packages to put younger Germans to work. A
second round will be held Feb. 25.
	   Jagoda said that the talks created a positive climate for jobs
creation, adding: ``I didn't expect a miracle. One must be
patient.''
	   Unemployment rose by 1 percent in both in eastern and western
Germany, to 15.9 percent in the east, and 8.8 percent in the west.
Joblessness has been most severe in the east, which is still
adjusting to a market economy after unifying with the capitalist
west in 1990.

Hutu rebels kill 25 people in Burundi
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUJUMBURA, Burundi (AP) _ Hutu rebels killed 25 people and
injured others in an attack south of Burundi's capital on a camp of
people displaced by war, a military spokesman said Tuesday.
	   Col. Mammert Sinarinzi said that on Monday night rebels attacked
the camp for displaced Hutu civilians in Rumonge commune, 80
kilometers (50 miles) south of Bujumbura, Burundi's capital. The
rebels killed 25 civilians and injured others, he said.
	   The army pursued the assailants and killed four of them, also
capturing two guns, Sinarinzi said. No other details about the
attack were available.
	   The rebels often attack Hutu civilians they believe are
collaborating with the Tutsi-led army and government.
	   Sinarinzi said rebels were moving through five provinces in
southern, western and northwestern Burundi last week after many
returned recently from Tanzania and neighboring Congo.
	   Hutu rebels attacks and army retaliations have killed more than
200,000 people in Burundi since 1993, when Tutsi paratroopers
assassinated the country's first democratically elected president,
a Hutu.

Report: Japan's Nissan to cut jobs in restructuring U.S.
</HEADLINE>
operations &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Nissan Motor Co., Japan's second-largest automaker,
plans to slash 500 jobs in the United States by 2000 as part of a
sweeping restructuring of its North American operations, a local
report said.
	   Nissan will merge its two California-based U.S. units, Nissan
North America Inc. and Nissan Motor Corp. in U.S.A., Japan's
leading business daily reported Wednesday, citing unidentified
company sources.
	   The company hopes the cost-cutting drive, along with a new sales
promotion effort, will allow its American operations to return to
profitability in the fiscal year starting in April, the Nihon
Keizai newspaper said.
	   A Nissan spokesman reached late Tuesday in Tokyo was unable to
confirm the report.
	   Last month, Nissan said it expects to post a 30 billion yen
(dlrs 250 million) net loss for this fiscal year at the group
level, which includes the parent company and its subsidiaries.
	   It projected losses from its troubled North American operations
at 5 billion yen (dlrs 42 million) this fiscal year, an improvement
over an 80 billion yen (dlrs 667 million) net loss in fiscal 1997.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin remained out of sight at a
Kremlin hospital Tuesday, leaving Russia's political establishment
to chew over his latest high-profile staff dismissals.
	   ``Yeltsin has broken away from the doctors' watch and again
shown he won't let anyone bury him,'' the liberal daily Segodnya
said, putting the brightest possible spin on the president's
decision to fire several senior aides.
	   Others were less charitable.
	   ``He is not governing anything any longer,'' Communist Party
leader Gennady Zyuganov said. ``This is simply an agony.''
	   Yeltsin, hospitalized since Nov. 22 with pneumonia, emerged
briefly Monday to fire Chief of Staff Valentin Yumashev and three
of his deputies. The president then returned to the hospital.
	   Yeltsin's spokesman said the president fired Yumashev for
failing to stem crime and for reacting too mildly to a Communist
parliament deputy's anti-Semitic remarks. But most people assumed
the aide was axed for speaking too candidly about Yeltsin's
declining health.
	   Yumashev has said Yeltsin was too weak to handle the day-to-day
responsibilities of his job.
	   ``In a situation when the presidential inner circle starts
speaking about the boss as if he were a political outsider, you
have to replace either the president, or his aides,'' the business
daily Kommersant said Tuesday. ``Yeltsin has chosen the second.''
	   Presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said doctors allowed the
president to take brief walks around the hospital grounds Tuesday
for the first time since he was hospitalized with pneumonia on Nov.
22.
	   ``That means he is on the way to recovery,'' Yakushkin was
quoted as saying by the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Yakushkin said Yeltsin was working on documents, but had no
meetings planned and would remain hospitalized as long as necessary
to recuperate.
	   ``Pneumonia is an illness that requires a serious treatment and
a certain regime,'' he said.
	   Yeltsin has been a part-time president for months as his health
has declined. He has played little role in Russia's pressing
economic problems. The Russian economy slumped earlier this year,
partly in response to Asia's economic travails, and plummeted after
Aug. 17, when the government devalued the ruble and temporarily
froze foreign debt payments.
	   Yeltsin fired almost his entire cabinet as a result of that
decision.

Egypt to receive aid for its girls' education programs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With UNICEF-Education Crisis &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egypt will receive a portion of media mogul
Ted Turner's dlrs 100 million donation to the United Nations to
help boost its projects on educating girls, Egypt's education
minister said Tuesday.
	   Minister Hussein Bahaeddin did not say how much money would be
allocated for the projects in 1999. The United Nations Children's
Fund, or UNICEF, will cooperate with the ministry on spending it.
	   ``This is an international, non-governmental appreciation for
what Egypt has achieved'' in educating girls, Bahaeddin said.
	   ``But it also puts a great responsibility on us'' to continue
with the programs, Bahaeddin added.
	   He was speaking at a news conference along with UNICEF
representative in Egypt, Leila Bisharat to mark the worldwide
release of UNICEF's 1999 State of the World's Children report.
	   According to UNICEF's 1995 figures, 95 percent of boys are
enrolled in the basic six-year primary education, compared to 82
percent of the girls.
	   Still, only 39 percent of Egyptian women above 15 can read and
write while the percentage for men is 64.
	   In Egypt's more traditional communities, girls are discouraged
from attending school. Poor families choose to educate boys on
grounds that they need to work as adults while girls would only
become housewives.
	   Also, in some communities where women don't mix freely with men,
girls are confined to their homes.
	   Egypt's success with primary school education is attributed to a
program to impart at least informal education in one-classroom
schools where children of different ages are taught in shifts.
	   Egypt has set up 1,980 such schools, mainly in the poor south,
and has managed to enroll 35,000 girls, according to a UNICEF
statement.
	   The initiative includes 70 co-educational schools. Bahaeddin
said up to 3,000 similar schools are expected to be built, mainly
in Egypt's villages.
	   Bisharat commended Egypt's increase of its education budget
nearly five times from 3 billion Egyptian pounds (dlrs 882 million)
in 1997 to 14 billion pounds (dlrs 4.1 billion) in 1998.

Rome decrees largest piazza a car-free zone
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Rome's mayor on Tuesday decreed that Piazza del
Popolo should be a piazza of the pedestrians, banning the cars that
had turned the city's largest square into a giant parking lot.
	   Hundreds gathered for a ceremony that made the transition to a
car-free zone official, applauding when Mayor Francesco Rutelli
declared: ``In this piazza, there will be no more cars, forever
more!''
	   The ceremony followed a dlrs 2.1 million restoration of the
square, whose gates have been the northern entry for pilgrims and
other travelers for century upon century.
	   The advent of the auto meant bumper-to-bumper traffic that
obscured the symmetry of the piazza's 16th-century design and
buried the base of its ancient Egyptian obelisk in car hoods and
chrome.
	   Rome has been far less vigorous than many other Italian cities
in limiting traffic in its historic center. To mollify merchants
near Piazza del Popolo, the city created 334 parking places just
outside the square.
	   Rutelli warned any graffiti artists tempted by Piazza del
Popolo's freshly refurbished, wide-open expanse to stay away,
warning of prosecution, and added another appeal for the new
sanctity of the piazza: ``Scooter drivers are implored to stay
out.''

Schroeder, Chirac want progress on EU finance reform
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany and France on Tuesday demanded that
an EU summit this week in Vienna ``make substantial progress and
define the available options'' for reform of European Union
financing.
	   In a joint letter, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and President
Jacques Chirac also called for a pact on ending unemployment in the
15 European Union nations that includes ``verifiable goals in the
tenets of ... employment policy.''
	   Schroeder and Chirac said all aspects of the so-called Agenda
2000 finance reform _ from EU financial contributions to farm
subsidies _ should be dealt with in one bloc and finalized at a
special summit in March.
	   The leaders addressed their letter to Austrian Chancellor Viktor
Klima, who currently chairs the EU presidency.
	   Germany, which takes over the six-month rotating EU presidency
on Jan. 1, wants to use its time in power to resolve EU
contributions.
	   Big contributors, led by Germany, complain their contributions
to the EU budget in Brussels are higher than subsidies flowing
back. On the other side are less wealthy nations, such as Spain and
Greece, which draw huge subsides.
	   German finance minister Oskar Lafontaine linked the question
excessive EU contributions to ``coordinating'' EU taxes during a
speech Tuesday.
	   In addition to crusading against high EU dues, Germany hopes an
EU ``code of conduct'' on tax havens can be adopted next year. The
measures, which members already have pledged to honor, are designed
to prevent nations from poaching investment from neighboring
countries through favorable tax rates for foreign companies.
	   ``There's no real solidarity when you expect Germany to pay
higher and higher contributions and then surround the country with
tax havens,'' said at rally of the Social Democratic party, which
he chairs.

Juve, Ajax in danger of failing to gain last eight
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ It could be a Champions Cup quarterfinal without
Juventus, Ajax Amsterdam and either Real Madrid or Inter Milan.
	   Arsenal and Barcelona are already out and there's even a chance
that Manchester United may not make it.
	   If the results fall a certain way on Wednesday night's final
round of group games, some of the biggest names in soccer will have
lost millions by failing to qualify. Some clubs which haven't won a
major title will be dreaming of glory.
	   Juventus, finalist for the last three seasons, has only a slim
chance of making it to the last eight, even though it is unbeaten
in the competition.
	   The problem is, La Juve has tied all five of its Group B games
and is three points behind leader Rosenborg of Norway and Turkey's
Galatasaray. To qualify, it needs to beat Rosenborg at home on
Wednesday and hope that the Turks lose to already eliminated
Athletic Bilbao.
	   ``We must think of winning our match. We will think of the other
match (in Bilbao) at the end of the game,'' said French forward
Zinedine Zidane. ``I don't think Juventus' winning cycle is over,
otherwise I would leave the team right now.''
	   Ajax, which won the Champions Cup for the fourth time only four
seasons ago and was losing finalist a year later, has stumbled in
this season's competition.
	   The team needs to win at FC Porto, which can't qualify, and hope
that Group A leader Olympiakos loses at Croatia Zagreb.
	   That would mean a three-way tie on 10 points and then it goes
down to head to head results with Croatia, winner in Amsterdam two
weeks ago, having a better record against Ajax.
	   The Dutch champion, whose form has slumped at home, will miss
its top European scorer, Finnish striker Jari Litmanen, Georgian
forward Shota Arveladze and South African star Benni McCarthy also
is doubtful because of injury.
	   Croatia Zagreb needs a 3-0 victory to overcome Olympiakos,
having lost 2-0 to the Greeks in Athens.
	   Inter Milan, 10 points, and Real Madrid, nine, are first and
second in Group C but can both be caught by Spartak Moscow, which
has eight.
	   The Russians go to Madrid and will eliminate the defending
champion with a victory while Inter, which has Brazilian star
Ronaldo back after injury, has a far easier game at Sturm Graz,
which has gained only one point from five games.
	   Inter, whose domestic form saw the firing of coach Gigi Simoni
two weeks ago, needs just a point to ensure qualification.
	   Unbeaten Manchester United needs a victory over Group D leader
Bayern Munich at Old Trafford to guarantee a quarterfinal place and
could even make it with a tie.
	   But a tie would mean the Reds would go out if the second place
teams in groups B and C, currently Galatasaray and Real Madrid,
wound up with more points.
	   Bayern players have been promised a bonus of 250,000 marks (dlrs
150,000) if they make the quarterfinals from the group that had
been dubbed the ``Group of Death'' in Germany.
	   ``It's the game of the year for us, an absolute highlight,''
said coach Ottmar Hitzfeld.
	   Group E leader Dynamo Kiev should clinch a quarterfinal place
with a tie at French champion Lens unless Panathinaikos has a
high-scoring victory over already eliminated and injury-ravaged
Arsenal.
	   Lens can only qualify by beating Kiev and will have to do so
without suspended Tony Vairelles, Cyril Rool and Eric Sikora.
	   Already sure of a place in the last eight German champion
Kaiserslautern faces last place HJK Helsinki in Group F.
	   Although second place Benfica, which visits PSV Eindhoven, can
tie Kaiserlautern on points and tied the Germans on the
head-to-head results, it finishes below them because Kaiserslautern
had more away goals in their two meetings.

Report: Kenyan president to visit Iran next week
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi will visit
Iran next week for talks on expanding ties, an Iranian newspaper
said Tuesday.
	   The English-language daily Iran News quoted Kenya's ambassador
to Tehran, Al-Haj Mohammed Soba, as saying that Moi will discuss
with Iranian officials ways of boosting political, economic and
cultural ties between the two countries.
	   He did not give an exact date for the trip.
	   Soba was not immediately available for comment and a Foreign
Ministry spokesman in Nairobi, Kenya, could not confirm Moi's
visit.
	   Soba said the balance of trade between Tehran and Nairobi was
overwhelmingly in favor of Iran, which exports oil, paraffin wax
and textile materials to Kenya.
	   Kenya is trying to promote the export of tea, coffee and fruits
such as pineapples and mangoes to Iran, Soba said.
	   He said Kenya was studying the possibility of using Iran as a
transit route for the export of its goods to the former Soviet
republics.
	   Kenya could also transfer its expertise in the tourism industry
to Iran, Soba said.
	   He said he hoped Moi's visit would pave the way for the easing
of travel regulations and visa requirements between Iran and Kenya.
	   In 1996, Iran and Kenya signed agreements of understanding that
paved the way for Iran to participate in building dams, power plant
projects, rehabilitation of Kenya's petrochemical industry and its
only oil refinery.
	   Kenya was also to buy Iranian tractors, agricultural machinery,
electrical appliances, telecommunication products and minerals,
while Kenyan geologists were to receive training in Iran's schools.

Venezuelan stock market opens strongly after Chavez victory

<TEXT>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ The Caracas stock market skyrocketed
Tuesday morning, indicating that president-elect Hugo Chavez's
conciliatory comments had eased investor fears that he would roll
back free market economic policies.
	   The market leaped by 11.7 percent on the first day it was open
since the former coup leader won a landslide election victory
Sunday. The market was closed Monday for a holiday.
	   ``Investors have recovered some of their confidence in the
country,'' said Leonardo Quintero, a broker at Caracas-based
BanFederal.
	   Since his election, Chavez has said he would cut Venezuela's
bloated government payroll, reduce the fiscal deficit and honor the
country's dlrs 21 billion foreign debt.
	   The 44-year-old former paratrooper is a messiah to millions of
poor people who believe he will punish the corrupt, wipe out misery
and return their oil-rich country to the days when it was dubbed
``Saudi Venezuela.''
	   But those expectations may be too high for Chavez's own good.
	   ``People think they are going to start eating better and living
better on Feb. 3,'' the day after Chavez is sworn in, said
historian Guillermo Moron. ``But that's not true.''
	   Hours after his victory, Chavez stood on a terrace overlooking
thousands of roaring supporters as floodlights lit the midnight
air.
	   ``The resurrection of Venezuela has begun, and nothing and no
one can stop it,'' he bellowed over loudspeakers.
	   Chavez, who has never held public office, is inheriting a
country with an economy in shambles and a political establishment
that views him as a villain because of his 1992 attempt to
overthrow the government.
	   ``Depressed oil prices and high un- and under-employment mean
that the next government will face some very difficult problems,
and it will take political skill, courage and resolution to deal
with them successfully,'' U.S. Ambassador John Maisto said.
	   The economy went into a tailspin earlier this year when oil
prices hit a 12-year low. Venezuela relies on oil for 75 percent of
its export revenue and over half the government budget, which has
been slashed by dlrs 2 billion this year.
	   Next year isn't expected to be much better. Oil prices are
likely to remain low.
	   Yet Chavez has already announced that he wants to boost the
current minimum monthly wage of dlrs 175, which is barely half of
what workers need to care for a family of five.
	   The question is: Where will the money come from?
	   Many workers are employed by the government. Its 1.3
million-person payroll is one of the most bloated in Latin America.
	   Chavez says he wants to streamline the bureaucracy, but laid-off
workers won't find new jobs if the economy doesn't turn around.
More than half of Venezuela's population of 23 million already is
mired in poverty.
	   Venezuela has Latin America's highest annual inflation rate at
30 percent. Looming in the immediate future is intense pressure to
devalue of the currency, the bolivar, and the possibility of a new
banking crisis. The financial system nearly collapsed in 1994-95
and required a dlrs 7 billion bailout.
	   Venezuela's new head of state could also encounter political
troubles. His leftist Patriotic Pole coalition won a plurality in
Nov. 8 congressional elections, but opposing parties still control
a majority of seats.
	   Chavez also wants to convene a constituent assembly to rewrite
the constitution and possibly dissolve Congress. That will revive
many of the hostilities that erupted during the campaign, which
polarized the country between rich and poor and between the
Patriotic Pole and Venezuela's two traditional parties.
	   Chavez will have to use his famed charisma to persuade
Venezuelans to show patience.
	   ``The rear-guard stabs at reform haven't gotten anywhere because
nobody has been able to capture the trust of the Venezuelan
people,'' said political consultant Eric Ekvall. ``If anyone has
this quality, it's Hugo Chavez.''

Rwanda demobilizes 3,000 soldiers, denies forceful round up
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GABIRO, Rwanda (AP) _ The Rwandan army on Tuesday discharged
more than 3,000 officers and soldiers in a bid to cut costs, but
said the demobilization will not affect the country's security.
	   ``If we were not facing insecurity in northwestern Rwanda and
war in Congo, all those wishing to leave would be allowed to do
so,'' Maj. Gen. Paul Kagame, vice president and minister of
defense, told the 3,639 people waiting to return to civilian life.
	   International donors financing almost half of Rwanda's dlrs 330
million 1999 budget are scrutinizing its military expenditure,
which is below 30 percent of the budget.
	   The government has agreed with the donors to cut its force from
the current 35,000 troops to 19,000 men by 2001, creating a
smaller, professional army that will be cheaper to train and
maintain.
	   The Rwandan Patriotic Army grew out of the Tutsi-led rebel force
that won power in July 1994 and put an end to a Hutu
government-organized genocide of more than 500,000 people.
	   It is still fighting defeated Hutu soldiers and militiamen, who
are conducting an insurgency in northwestern Rwanda, often from
bases across the border in eastern Congo.
	   In August, Rwanda sent troops and arms to Congo in support of
Congolese rebels fighting to oust President Laurent Kabila.
	   Kagame said on Sunday Rwandan troops will remain in Congo until
security along its borders is guaranteed, and accused Kabila of
recruiting thousands of Hutu fighters who had fled Rwanda in fear
of reprisals for the 1994 slaughter.
	   ``Rwanda has enough soldiers to take care of its security,''
Kagame said Tuesday at the Gabiro military camp, 100 kilometers (60
miles) northeast of Kigali.
	   Earlier, Kagame rejected criticism that the army was recruiting
additional troops for Congo, where they are facing a
counteroffensive by the Congolese government and its allies from
Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia and Chad.
	   He said the recruitment was halted several months ago because of
budgetary constraints, and promised to continue the troop
demobilization, cutting costs on uniforms and salaries and allowing
the purchase of weapons.
	   Among those demobilized Tuesday were war-handicapped, elderly,
those wanting to leave the army, and soldiers not meeting the new
army's skill requirements.
	   ``I was wounded in the leg which was amputated in 1993,'' said
2nd Lt. Bosse Rwemaloike. ``Now I want to continue my education,
which I interrupted to join the struggle. Competition in civilian
life is tight, so I have to catch up.'
	   Ephraim Kabaija, head of the Rwanda Demobilization and
Reintegration Commission, appealed to foreign donors at the
ceremony to help finance the demobilization program. Out of dlrs 10
million pledged for the program, only half has been disbursed.
	   Each of the demobilized men, including four colonels, will
receive 300,000 Rwandan francs (dlrs 1,000) in increments over
several months.

China's English coach thinks Fan ready for Premiership
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The English coach of China's soccer
squad said Tuesday that national captain and Crystal Palace star
Fan Zhiyi is ready for the English Premiership.
	   Bobby Houghton praised Fan after China's 3-1 victory in a
second-round match against Tajikistan, one step further toward a
preliminary group showdown Saturday with Asian power Iran.
	   ``Fan is the best defender in Asia,'' Houghton said. ``I'd like
to see him playing in the Premiership.''
	   Fan has scored just one goal in three matches in the Asian
Games, an Olympic-style event where the soccer favorites are Iran,
China, South Korea and Kuwait.
	   But his defensive skills have anchored a mixed squad of veterans
and untried players whom Houghton is testing in preparation for the
2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia.

Prosecution demands continued custody for opposition leader
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Ukrainian opposition leader Pavlo Lazarenko
appeared before a Swiss court Tuesday to deny allegations of money
laundering, amid continuing demonstrations for his release in Kiev.
	   The Geneva court will decide Friday on the prosecution's demands
that Lazarenko, a former prime minister, be kept for an additional
three months in preventive detention.
	   The defense urged his release on bail of 4-5 million Swiss
francs (dlrs 2.8-dlrs 3.6 million), saying the charges were
insufficient.
	   ``It's important that he should be released to carry out his
political responsibilities,'' said defense counsel Paul Gully-Hart.
	   Lazarenko admitted moving money to Swiss accounts but claimed he
could prove it was not of criminal origin.
	   Lazarenko was detained last week as he entered Switzerland and
charged last Friday in connection with a ``relatively large'' sum
of money.
	   His supporters in Ukraine claim he is the victim of a political
campaign.
	   ``Shame on Switzerland,'' shouted some 150 demonstrators outside
the Swiss embassy in Kiev on a second day of protests Tuesday.
Banners suggested that Geneva investigators had been bribed.
	   Lazarenko was prime minister from 1996 to 1997, and was
dismissed by President Leonid Kuchma. Critics say he reaped huge
profits from the distribution of natural gas supplies in the former
Soviet republic when he served as prime minister, but he and his
allies deny the charges.
	   Lazarenko maintains the authorities want to discredit him before
presidential elections in October 1999, and he has even accused
Kuchma's close entourage of plotting to kill him.
	   Lazarenko's centrist Hromada party fared well in parliamentary
elections this year and he was widely considered a top contender in
the future presidential race.
	   A Geneva judge, Laurent Kasper-Ansermet, is currently in Ukraine
in connection with the investigation.

Report: Japan's Nissan to cut jobs in restructuring of U.S.
</HEADLINE>
operations &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Nissan Motor Co., Japan's second-largest automaker,
plans to slash 500 jobs in the United States by 2000 as part of a
sweeping restructuring of its North American operations, a
newspaper reported.
	   Nissan will merge its two California-based U.S. units, Nissan
North America Inc. and Nissan Motor Corp., Japan's leading business
daily reported in its early Wednesday edition, citing unnamed
company sources.
	   The company hopes the cost-cutting drive, along with a new sales
promotion effort, will allow its American operations to return to
profitability in the fiscal year starting next April, the Nihon
Keizai newspaper said.
	   A Nissan spokesman reached late Tuesday in Tokyo was unable to
confirm the report.
	   Last month, Nissan said it expects to post a 30 billion yen
(dlrs 250 million) net loss in the fiscal year ending next March at
the group level, which includes the parent company and its
subsidiaries.
	   It also projected losses from its troubled North American
operations would be limited to 5 billion yen (dlrs 42 million) this
fiscal year, an improvement over an 80 billion yen (dlrs 667
million) net loss in fiscal 1997.

Report: Hundreds loot supplies for factory owned by ex-leader's
</HEADLINE>
daughter

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Hundreds of people at two Indonesian
ports have looted supplies of raw sugar which were being
transported to a processing factory believed to be owned by a
daughter of former President Suharto, a report said Tuesday.
	   The looting began Monday after bags of unprocessed sugar were
loaded onto trucks in two ports in the Serang regency, about 100
kilometers (62 miles) west of Jakarta, the state-run Antara news
agency reported.
	   Outnumbered local policemen were unable to stop crowds, which
included high school students, from jumping onto the trucks and
stealing the bags of sugar, the report said.
	   It quoted some of those participating in the looting as saying
the action was prompted by rumors the supplies were bound for PT.
Bermis, a processing factory they believed to be owned by Suharto's
eldest daughter, Siti Hardiyanti Rukmana.
	   After 32 years of authoritarian rule over the Southeast Asian
country, Suharto quit in May amid civil unrest and political
turmoil.
	   But Indonesia has been rocked by continued unrest since then,
partially as a result of demands that the former president by put
on trial for alleged corruption.

Parma qualifies for quarterfinals on 3-1 victory
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARMA, Italy (AP) _ Parma qualified for the UEFA Cup
quarterfinals Tuesday rallying to a 3-1 victory, from a 0-1
first-half deficit, against Glasgow Rangers in their third-round
second-leg match.
	   The Italian team preserved a four-year unbeaten home streak in
European games on second-half goals by Abel Balbo, Stefano Fiore
and Enrico Chiesa.
	   Parma advanced on a 4-2 aggregate score following a 1-1 draw in
the first leg at Glasgow.
	   Rangers was eliminated on its first season defeat in the
European competition that it had started from pre-qualifying
rounds.
	   German midfielder Jorg Albertz put the Scottish team ahead in
the 28th minute with a powerful diagonal drive from the penalty
area edge.
	   The Rangers player intercepted an erratic pass by Argentine
defender Nestor Sensini, rushed through the wide-open Parma defense
and sent the ball past national team keeper Gianluigi Buffon.
	   Parma's second-half rally was made easier by the expulsion of
Rangers' Italian defender Sergio Porrini in the 45th minute, which
forced the visitors one player down for the entire second half.
	   Porrini received his second caution in the match when he fouled
Chiesa who had outpaced him.
	   Rangers immediately paid for its reshuffled defense in the 47th
when Argentine veteran forward Balbo, left unmarked close to the
net, kicked in Parma's equalizer.
	   Balbo was fed by Chiesa who headed toward the teammate, from an
angled position, a perfect cross by Argentine Juan Sebastian Veron.
	   Midfielder Stefano Fiore put Parma in front in the 62nd with a
powerful long-distance shot, minutes after entering the field as
substitute for Alain Boghossian.
	   Another Italian defender of Rangers, Lorenzo Amoruso, definitely
sank his team when he handed the ball in the penalty area to stop a
pass to Chiesa.
	   Chiesa, who had tallied Parma's both goals in last Saturday's
2-0 win against Sampdoria of Genoa, converted the penalty kick in
the 68th for the final 3-1 score.
	   Parma, which is tied in second place with AS Roma in the Italian
league standings, kept cool despite the first-half deficite and
took advantage of playing 11 against 10 as Rangers gradually faded
out.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The chief spokesman for Kosovo
Albanian rebels rejected the latest peace plan for the troubled
province Tuesday, and called for the removal of its American
architect for alleged pro-Serb bias.
	   In Brussels, Belgium, however, NATO foreign ministers endorsed
U.S. diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis and called on Serbs
and ethnic Albanians to ``move rapidly in a spirit of compromise
and accommodation.''
	   The ministers also reaffirmed that any settlement must respect
the territorial integrity of Yugoslavia, putting them at odds with
ethnic Albanians seeking independence for the majority Albanian
province.
	   Speaking to reporters, rebel spokesman Adem Demaci said the
latest peace plan drafted by U.S. envoy Christopher Hill is ``fully
unacceptable'' primarily because it doesn't envisage what will
happen to the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army if it was adopted.
	   ``Mr. Hill either doesn't understand the Albanian problems, or
he is leaning toward the Serbs,'' Demaci said, adding: ``The State
Department should reconsider the results of his work'' and ``send
us more qualified people.''
	   Demaci also acknowledged that the KLA was using lull in the
fighting to arm itself and prepare for more battles with government
troops.
	   ``The KLA has no illusion that the (Serb) regime will
democratize overnight and that it will give up trying to find a
solution through force for the Kosovo crisis,'' Demaci said. ``It
would be dangerous if the Albanians don't continue arming
themselves and preparing for resistance.''
	   Hundreds were killed and almost 300,000 ethnic Albanians
displaced in a seven-month crackdown by Serbian forces against
Kosovo's separatists, before an October peace agreement brought
about a tentative truce.
	   In a statement issued in Brussels, NATO foreign ministers
deplored the on-going violence in Kosovo, blaming both Serbs and
ethnic Albanians.
	   ``Since the beginning of November, violent incidents provoked in
some cases by Serbian security forces and in others by armed
Kosovar elements have increased tension,'' the ministers said.
``These incidents show that both the Belgrade authorities and the
armed Kosovar elements have failed to comply fully with the
requirements set on in U.N. Security Council resolutions.''
	   The NATO ministers reaffirmed their support for a political
solution ``which provides an enhanced status for Kosovo, a
substantially greater degree of autonomy and meaningful
self-administration'' but which ``preserves the territorial
integrity'' of Yugoslavia.
	   The Americans and Europeans fear independence would lead to
similar demands by other ethnic Albanian communities elsewhere in
the southern Balkans. That in turn could destabilize what has
historically been one of Europe's most unstable regions.
	   In a statement Tuesday, the U.S.-based Human Rights Watch
claimed more than 1,000 Kosovo Albanians are in Serbian prisons and
police stations, and at least five have died from beatings and
torture.
	   ``Five individuals are known to have died in detention since
July 1998 from the violence inflicted on them by the police prison
guards,'' said a Human Rights Watch statement.
	   The statement, faxed to The Associated Press bureau in Belgrade,
said hundreds of others have been injured from beatings and
torture, often used to extract confessions.

Police seize 100 kilos of heroin in southeast Turkey
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkish police seized close to 100
kilograms (220 pounds) of heroin and detained 13 people in a town
near the borders with Iran and Iraq, the Anatolia news agency
reported Tuesday.
	   Turkey is a hub for drugs moving from Asia to Europe and North
America.
	   Authorities in Yuksekova uncovered a heroin production lab and
seized hundreds of kilos of chemicals used in heroin refinement,
the report said. Police also found some 50 kilograms (110 pounds)
of hashish.
	   The drugs had an estimated market value of dlrs 1.2 million.

Poland rejects missile deal with Israel

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Israeli response in grafs 4-5 &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Saying Israel failed to fulfill
agreements, Poland on Tuesday rejected a deal to arm its Huzar
helicopter with Israeli-made missiles, Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek
said.
	   Making the announcement after a weekly Cabinet meeting, Buzek
said the deal announced last year was rejected because ``Israel has
failed to hold tests in Poland of the missile that we were to
buy.''
	   He also cited objections raised by the government auditing
agency over the handling of a tender for a separate deal involving
integrating systems for the Huzar helicopter. An Israeli company
also won that contract.
	   Buzek called the missile deal that Poland's previous leftist
government signed with Israel a preliminary agreement and said
scrapping it will have no legal or financial consequences, the
state news agency PAP reported.
	   But Israel's Defense Ministry, in a brief statement Tuesday,
disputed Buzek's position.
	   ``From Israel's point of view, the agreement that was signed in
October 1997 is still in force,'' the ministry said. ``Israel is
now considering its response _ political and legal.''

State-run radio says U.S. decision on drugs meaningless
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ The U.S. government's decision to remove
Iran from its list of main drug-producing countries is meaningless
and will not affect Iran's fight against drugs, state-run Tehran
Radio said Tuesday.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton announced Monday he was removing
Iran from the list because it is no longer a significant producer
of opium poppy, used in heroin production, and has ceased to be a
major transit point for U.S.-bound illicit drugs.
	   ``Whether ... Iran is included or not included in the annual
list of the American government will not remove anything or add
anything to the reality of Iran's campaign against international
drug smuggling,'' the radio said.
	   After Clinton's announcement, officials in Washington said the
decision was not political but reflected actual changes in Iran.
	   Still, the radio commentary questioned Washington's motive.
	   ``Is the decision by the U.S. government a political measure to
reduce tension between the two countries?'' the commentator asked.
``Or is it that the White House has simply succumbed to ... Iran's
successful campaign to curb the production and transfer of
narcotics?''
	   Clinton has been attempting to reach out to Iran, hoping to
establish a government-to-government dialogue for the first time in
two decades. But Iran has shown little interest.
	   Iran's Supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said a month ago
that the United States is intent on ``total domination'' of Iran
and that maintaining severed relations was in Iran's interest.
	   The United States broke relations with Iran after Muslim
militants seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran during the 1979 Islamic
Revolution.
	   Iran has been cracking down on drug smugglers since 1988.
Hundreds of traffickers have been hanged under a law that mandates
the death penalty for anyone caught with more than a small quantity
of narcotics.
	   Large drug hauls are common in Iran, which lies on a route used
by smugglers to get drugs from Pakistan and Afghanistan to Europe
and the oil-rich Gulf.

	   UTRECHT, Netherlands (AP) _ The first Dutch euro coin tumbled
out of the minting machine Tuesday _ and it went straight into the
pocket of Dutch Queen Beatrix.
	   The new European currency, known as the euro, will debut on
paper on Jan. 1. Euro coins and notes come into circulation in the
11 participating nations between Jan. 1 and June 30, 2002.
	   The euro coins share a common European design on one side, but
carry individual national designs on the flip side. The Netherlands
has chosen a portrait of Beatrix for its euro coins.
	   The freshly minted coin _ presented to the queen in a ceremony
at the Netherlands Mint _ was the first of more than 3 billion euro
coins that will be produced to replace the current Dutch guilder
coins.
	   The denominations for the coins will include: 1 cent, 2 cents, 5
cents, 10 cents, 20 cents, 50 cents, 1 euro and 2 euros.

Prague returned to Frankfurt just minutes into the flight Tuesday
after a smoke warning light went on in the cockpit, the airline
said.

Shell says talks held with Iraqi oil ministry
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The Royal Dutch-Shell Group of Cos. said Tuesday
that it has held talks with officials in Iraq's oil ministry about
the exploration and development of an oil field in southern Iraq.
	   ``Shell has had preliminary talks with the ministry of oil in
Iraq. Whether any more talks have been slated I could not say,''
spokesman James Herbert said Tuesday.
	   Herbert declined to give further details, citing commercial
confidentiality.
	   ``Shell does not want to go into a great deal of detail about
this for commercial reasons,'' Herbert said.
	   However, the Middle Eastern Economic Review, a Cyprus-based
journal, reported on Monday that Shell representatives met with
officials from the Ministry of Oil in November about the Ratawi
field, 100 miles (160 kms) north of Basra.
	   The journal said that Shell has proposed a dlrs 2.8 billion
exploration and development plan for a 20-year contract on the
field. The journal said that two other oil firms were also
negotiating for development of the same field.
	   A report in Monday's Guardian, a London-based liberal-broadsheet
newspaper, quoted a development figure of dlrs 1.3 billion for the
oil field, which would produce 250,000 barrels of oil per day.
	   Herbert said that regardless of the outcome of talks, Shell
would not move towards any involvement in Iraq that would
contradict UN sanctions imposed on Iraq in 1990 after its invasion
of Kuwait and which limit the sale of oil, ban air travel and bar
other financial dealings.

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ China blitzed into the Asian Games gold
medals lead Tuesday with another weightlifting world record, a
diving sweep and a lengthened winning streak in gymnastics.
	   There was nary a Chinese gold in the swimming pool, however.
Japan, swamped in the 1994 games by a drug-tainted Chinese squad,
won four of the night's races and Taiwan took one.
	   South Korea won three golds _ one in the debut Asian Games sport
of seven-man rugby, where it beat archrival Japan 29-14 in the
final, and two in its native combat sport of taekwondo.
	   After two full days of medal competition, China led with 13
golds, Japan had 12 and South Korea eight.
	   Host Thailand and Kazakstan both increased their count to three
golds with shooting victories.
	   Teams winning their first golds of these games included
Mongolia, with two in judo; Taiwan, with one in swimming and one in
taekwondo; Pakistan, with one in the debut sport of snooker;
Turkmenistan and Kuwait, both in shooting, and Vietnam, in
taekwondo.
	   Mongolia's Haliun Boldbaatar defeated 1997 world champion Kenzo
Nakamura of Japan in men's lightweight judo.
	   In the last gold medal match of the night, Pakistan's Shokat Ali
beat Malaysia's Chong Tin-sam 7-6 for the snooker singles title in
a match lasting more than five hours.
	   Xiong Guoming, one of seven Chinese swimmers who tested positive
for steroids in the 1994 games, where he won four golds, almost
made a winning comeback in the 400-meter medley. But Japan's
Takahiro Mori overtook him in the final freestyle leg and won by
1.6 seconds.
	   Other Japanese winners were Takashi Yamamoto in the men's
100-meter butterfly, Masami Tanaka, who edged China's Qi Hui by .27
seconds in the women's 200-meter breaststroke, and the men's
4x200-meter freestyle relay team. Taiwan's Tsai Shu-min won the
women's 200-meter freestyle.
	   At the pool earlier, the only competition for divers Tiang Liang
and Guo Jingjing, both world championships silver medalists, came
from Chinese teammates.
	   Tiang pulled away from Huang Qiang late in the men's platform
diving. He had a perfect 10 from one of the seven judges on the
ninth of his 10 dives.
	   Guo pulled steadily ahead of Yang Lan, although the crowd didn't
share in her triumph as the scoreboard at the end showed bronze
medalist Irina Vyguzova of Kazakstan in first place.
	   ``I didn't care,'' said Guo. ``I knew I'd won.''
	   For the second consecutive day, a Chinese woman weightlifter
broke a world record. On her way to the gold in the 53-kilogram
division, Yang Xia jerked 120.0 kilograms, breaking the mark of
117.5 set by China's Wang Xiufen last month, and lifted a total of
212.5, also eclipsing a mark set by Wang _ 210.0.
	   China's Le Maosheng won gold in the men's 62-kilogram division
weightlifting.
	   The Chinese victory in women's team gymnastics gave that nation
its seventh consecutive sweep of both the men and women's team
events at the Asian Games. Japan captured silver, and Kazakstan won
bronze, edging out Uzbekistan by less than half a point.
	   Outside the pool, Japan's only gold of the day came from Akihito
Udagawa's triumph in mountain bike cross-country racing, by a
nearly seven-minute margin over Thailand's Surajit Jirowong. He won
in 2 hours, 5 minutes, 7 seconds.
	   Then China's Ma Yanping beat Japan's Kanako Kobayashi 2:07.28 to
2:11.45 for gold in the women's race.
	   While China captured the team gold medal in women's air pistol
shooting, Kazakstan's Dina Aspandiyarova edged China's Cai Yeqing
486.8 to 486.0 for the individual title.
	   China also finished second to Kuwait, 356 to 355, in the team
event of men's skeet shooting. For the individual gold, Kazakstan's
Sergy Yakshin beat Kuwait's Abdullah al-Rashidi 149 to 145.
	   Host Thailand won the men's free rifle prone shooting by beating
Kyrgyzstan 1,758 to 1,752. But Turkmenistan's Igor Pirekeev beat
Thailand's Taravit Majcharcheep 697.2 to 693.3 for the individual
gold.
	   South Korea won its two taekwondo golds in the lightweight
division, where Lee Sun-hee won the women's title by beating
Taiwan's Hsu Chih-ling and Kim Byung-uk took the men's with a 6-0
shutout against Taiwan's Sung Chen-hsien.
	   In the flyweight division, Taiwan's Tang Hui-wen beat Thailand's
Sinlapajarn Usa for the women's gold and Vietnam's Nhat Thong Ho
defeated Satriyo Rahadani of Indonesia for the men's.
	   A North-South Korean battle in judo ended with the North's Kye
Sun Hui beating the South's Kim Hye-sook for gold in the women's
half-lightweight class.
	   Mongolia's H. Erdenet-Od beat China's Shen Jun for the women's
lightweight division gold.

	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Mathias Fredriksson beat brother Tobias in
the semifinals and went on win a Nordic World Cup cross-country
sprint Tuesday to vault himself atop the season standings.
	   The Swede's first World Cup victory the 25-year-old 150 points
and the overall lead after two events.
	   Fredriksson placed fourth in the season opener at Muonio,
Finland, last month, a 10-kilometer freestyle race won by his
teammate Per Elofsson.
	   Elofsson was eliminated in the first round Tuesday.
	   Fredriksson won the two-man final against Peter Schlickenrieder
when his German opponent took a wrong turn during the third of four
laps while leading the favored Swede.
	   The women's final, won by Norway's Anita Moen-Guidon, also was
decided by a mishap.
	   Slovenian Andreja Mali fell a few meters from the finish line
while trying to fight off a strong rally by the Norwegian.
	   Italian favorite Stefania Belmondo fell and was eliminated in
the first round.
	   Tobias Fredriksson, who lost his semifinal following a
shoulder-to-shoulder duel with his brother, still reached the
podium by beating Norway's Odd-Bjorn Hjelmeset for third place.
	   Another Norwegian, Tor Arne Hetland, beat defending Milan sprint
champion Ari Pololahti of Finland for fifth.
	   Pololahti was also victim of a mistake when he headed toward the
finish line one lap too soon.
	   The event was held at an indoor area usually used for the Milan
ready-to-wear fashion shows in spring and autumn.
	   Skiers raced on artificial snow over four laps and a distance of
1 kilometer.
	   Mathias Fredriksson said he was surprised with his victory and
with his semifinal success against his brother.
	   ``Normally, Tobias is faster in sprints ... In this kind of race
you must be lucky to start in front and take good turns,'' he said.
	   The Swede said things may change quickly atop the World Cup
standings, beginning with the next event scheduled at Toblach
(Dobbiaco), Italy, this weekend.
	   Tuesday's victory, also a first for Moen-Guidon, moved the
Norwegian into second place in the women's overall standings with
114 points, 26 behind Katerina Neumannova, who won the season
opener in Muonio and placed fourth on Tuesday.
	   Moen-Guidon said she was lucky to win.
	   ``When I saw her falling I was happy to be first ... I always
thought it was not finished before the line,'' Moen-Guidon said.
	   Tuesday's sprints were skipped by the Russian team and by
Norwegian Bjorn Dahlie.

FIS moves postponed men's downhill to Italy

<TEXT>
	   OBERHOFEN, Switzerland (AP) _ A men's downhill race wiped out by
fog at Whistler, Canada, will be held Dec. 18 in the Italian resort
of Val Gardena, the International Ski Federation announced Tuesday.
	   On Sunday, heavy fog at Whistler forced cancellation of the
World Cup race for the third straight day.
	   The rescheduled race will be followed Dec. 19 by another men's
downhill, which already was scheduled for Val Gardena.
	   A decision will be made Wednesday on rescheduling a men's
super-giant slalom, also wiped out at Whistler, FIS said.
	   The Whistler event has been hit by three years of bad weather.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian Orthodox archbishop of the southern
region of Tatarstan was stabbed in the face by a burglar after
trying to chase him down, a news report said Tuesday.
	   Archbishop Anastasy and his assistant, who was stabbed in the
arm, were hospitalized in Kazan, Tatarstan's capital.
	   The two priests heard someone fiddling with the lock on their
house late Monday. They opened the door and confronted the burglar,
and he ran off, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Anastasy and his assistant tried to chase him, but he turned
around and stabbed them with a knife, the report said.
	   The suspect has been detained. He told police he had lost his
way and knocked at the archbishop's door to ask directions.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ President Jacques Chirac lunched at his Elysee
Palace with the Dalai Lama on Tuesday despite China's calls on the
French government to cancel the invitation to the Tibetan spiritual
leader.
	   France defended its effort to host the Dalai Lama but also
affirmed Tibet should remain part of China.
	   The exiled leader's visit to Paris to participate in the 50th
anniversary celebration of the Universal Declaration of the Rights
of Man was ``natural,'' the French government said.
	   ``The Dalai Lama is a respected religious figure and respected
by the international community and the French people,'' Foreign
Ministry spokesman Francois Rivasseau told a daily news briefing
before the lunch.
	   ``France has always recognized that Tibet has been part of
China. That position is unchanged,'' he added.
	   Speaking after the luncheon, the Dalai Lama told reporters: ``My
position remains the same. I am trying to promote meaningful
self-rule, not independence, through dialogue.''
	   The Dalai Lama added that he is optimistic about the future.
``China is in the process of changing,'' he said.

U.S, Belgian lawmakers call for U.N investigation in Rwanda
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to fix slug &QL; 
genocide; present new evidence
 &UR; By RAF CASERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - Legislators from the United States and
Belgium claimed Tuesday they had new evidence the United Nations
had prior warnings of preparations for the 1994 Rwanda genocide and
called for a U.N. investigation into why it failed to act.
	   On the eve of the 50th anniversary of the U.N. Genocide
Convention, Belgian senator Alain Destexhe and U.S. Representative
Cynthia McKinney presented a U.N. document showing what they called
clear identification of genocide planners, well before the killing
started on April 6-7, 1994.
	   The state-sponsored genocide killed an estimated 500,000 people
from the Tutsi-ethnic minority and moderates among the Hutu
majority.
	   The lawmakers want to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to set
up an inquiry commission into why the U.N. did not respond to
warnings that elements linked to the Hutu-led government were
planning to slaughter Tutsis.
	   ``What's the use of remembering the Genocide Convention if you
don't do anything when it happens,'' said Destexhe, who initiated a
Belgian Senate Committee into the killings.
	   ``It is of paramount importance to know what the United Nations
and the United States knew of the possibility of genocide and
massive killings in Rwanda and why they did not move to prevent
this,'' said Rep. McKinney, D-Ga., in a statement.
	   They called for a U.N. investigation to be carried out by an
independent panel of experts. McKinney also called for a further
U.S. investigation following a congressional hearing held in May.
	   The two legislators said they had obtained an ``interoffice
memorandum'' of the U.N. Assistance Mission in Rwanda, dated Feb.
17, 1994, warning that a Hutu ``death squad'' was planning to kill
two government opponents.
	   The victims were named as Landoald Ndasingwa, co-founder of
Rwanda's Parti Liberal and Joseph Kavaruganda, president of the
nation's constitutional council. Destexhe said both were killed
during the first days of the genocide.
	   He said the letter also named the heads of the death squad as
figures close to late Hutu President Juvenal Habyarimana whose
death in an unexplained aircrash sparked the genocide. Destexhe
claimed the letter was evidence the death squad members were
preparing for a wider killing spree.
	   Annan was head of U.N. peacekeeping operations at the time, he
says the U.N. force in Rwanda lacked the military might and
political backing to stop the slaughter.
	   Destexhe said Annan could have done more to prevent the genocide
after receiving a Jan. 11, 1994 fax from the U.N. commander Gen.
Romeo Dallaire that he had been informed that extremists were
planning to exterminate Tutsis. Dallaire wanted to raid an
extremists' arms cache but Annan overruled him, citing the limits
of a U.N. mandate, Destexhe said.
	   ``Annan had other options,'' said Destexhe, saying he could have
leaked such information to influential media or sending a warning
to the U.N. Security Council.

Palestinian militants to meet to oppose charter's amendment
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Palestinian hard-liners are to meet in
Syria this weekend to re-affirm their allegiance to a charter that
calls for Israel's destruction, and to reject Yasser Arafat's move
to amend it.
	   ``The meeting will express our rejection of peace agreements
with Israel, counter Arafat's plan to give legitimacy to Israel's
occupation of our lands, and reiterate our support for the
Palestinian charter,'' hard-liner Bahjat Abu Gharbiyeh told The
Associated Press in Amman.
	   More than 300 delegates are expected to attend the Dec. 12
meeting called by 10 Damascus-based groups at Youth City, Damascus.
Other delegates are expected from Egypt, Lebanon, Europe and North
America.
	   Gharbiyeh, a former member of the Palestine National Council,
effectively the Palestinians' parliament, is leading a group of 67
Jordanian-based delegates to the Dec. 12 conference.
	   The meeting will be chaired by Khaled al-Fahoum, a former
chairman of the Palestine National Council, said Ali Badwan, the
spokesman of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine.
	   The hard-liners are urging a boycott of the Dec. 14 meeting of
the Palestinian National Council in Gaza City at which mainstream
Palestinians are expected to nullify those parts of the Palestinian
National Charter that call for Israel's destruction.
	   The hard-liners in Damascus will ``map out a plan for continued
struggle against the Israeli occupation (of Palestinian lands) and
the rejection of any peace agreement with the Zionists,'' Gharbiyeh
said. He did not elaborate.
	   Badwan told The Associated Press in Damascus that Palestinian
leader Arafat should not amend the charter while Israel is building
settlements on Palestinian.
	   The amendment is required by the Israeli-Palestinian peace
accords of Oslo and Wye River, which was signed by Arafat and
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   These agreements call upon the Palestinians to purge their
charter of words that deny Israel's right to exist.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton is scheduled to attend the Gaza
assembly in a sign of America's commitment to the peace process.
	   Among the participants at the Damascus meeting are leaders who
figure high on Israel's list of persons wanted for violence.
	   They include Ahmed Jibril of the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine-General Command, George Habash of the
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, Nayef Hawatmeh of
the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, and Ramadan
Abdullah Shallah of Islamic Jihad.
	   Among the other militant groups expected at the conference are
Fateh Uprising and Hamas, which carried out a series of suicide
bombings in Israel in 1996-97.

Pacific port city of Vladivostok declares state of emergency
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in 2nd graf with population of city. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Officials in Russia's Pacific port city of
Vladivostok declared a state of emergency because half the
buildings in the city are without heat as temperatures drop below
freezing, a news report said Monday.
	   Schools and day care centers have been closed, and hospitals
will soon be evacuated if the situation doesn't improve in
Vladivostok, a city of 600,000 people located about 6,400
kilometers (4,000 miles) east of Moscow, according to the Interfax
news agency.
	   Making matters worse, the city was inundated early Monday by a
major snowstorm, Interfax said.
	   City officials blame local energy supplier Dalenergo for the
shortage. They say Dalenergo is poorly managed and doesn't maintain
its equipment.
	   More than 500 apartment buildings in the city aren't getting
heat because of leaks in steam pipes belonging to Dalenergo,
according to Interfax.
	   The Vladivostok city administration sent an emergency appeal to
Russian President Boris Yeltsin requesting that he set up a
commission to resolve the crisis, Interfax said.
	   With no money to buy fuel oil, the city has also had to cut down
output at three heating plants.
	   Almost all apartments in Vladivostok are centrally heated by a
city-run system, and few have alternate means of heating their
homes aside from costly and dangerous electric heating devices.
	   Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, providing heat through
the winter has been a major problem for towns in Russia's Far East,
where money is scarce for fuel supplies.

Alternative Nobel winners just say 'no,' then follow with 'yes'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JIM HEINTZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ In the view of this year's winners of
the ''alternative Nobels,'' being positive begins with a negative _
saying ''No.''
	   One of the winners of the Right Livelihood awards is saying no
to plans to build a habitat-destrying Chilean dam, two others are
saying no to corporations that push the use of cancer-causing
substances or pressure mothers not to breast-feed their children,
and the last no is aimed at deeply rooted cultures of repression
and resentment.
	   The Right Livelihood awards were founded by philanthropist Jakob
von Uexkull in 1980 to recognize the kinds of social activist work
that he believes gets ignored by the Nobel Prizes.
	   Although the awards are much smaller than the Nobels _ 450,000
kronor (dlrs 56,250) apiece this year compared with the Nobels' 7.6
million kronor (dlrs 950,000) _ the prizes have developed
substantial prestige, enough that they are presented each year in
the Swedish Parliament on the day before the Nobels.
	   This year's prizes go to Samuel Epstein, chairman of the
U.S.-based Cancer Prevention Coalition; Juan Pablo Orrego and his
group fighting the damming of the Bio Bio river; the International
Baby Food Action Network, and Croatian peace activists Vesna
Terselic and Katarina Kruhonja.
	   Terselic of the Croatian Anti-War Campaign told a news
conference of the winners on Tuesday that a critical element of her
work was in teaching people they can stand up against the
heavy-handedness of governments and warlords who inflame ethnic
tensions.
	   ''The culture where we live is still a culture of obedience, a
culture of silence,'' she said.
	   Although Croatia's war ended in 1991, ''we who live there could
say the war is not over. The society has to be much more tolerant
than it is now,'' said Kruhonja, from the Center for Peace,
Non-Violence and Human Rights.
	   Ira Puspadewi of the IBFAN said she learned to say no after
seeing her first child becoming frequently sick while feeding on
infant formula.
	   At first ''I was very happy when the sales person, through a
nurse, gave me two cans ... I was very loyal to that brand,'' said
the Indonesian woman. But the child's illnesses prompted her to try
breast-feeding for her second child, who has been sick only rarely,
she said.
	   Epstein, who teaches at the University of Illinois-Chicago,
criticized officials in many countries for the ''standard
industrial philosophy'' _ giving more attention to diagnosing and
treating cancer than to preventing it.
	   He proposes an absolute ban on the introduction of new
substances known to cause cancer and more effort to make the public
aware of health information that now ''remains buried in government
and industrial files and inaccessible scientific literature.''
	   Orrego not only opposes plans to dam the Bio Bio because they
would destroy the habitat of idigenous peoples, but said Chile's
growing reliance on hydropower from dams makes the country's power
grid extremely vulnerable to drought.

Dzurinda canceled Meciar's controversial amnesty
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Prime Minister Mikulas Dzurinda on
Tuesday canceled a controversial amnesty granted by his predecessor
to those involved in the kidnapping of the son of the former Slovak
president and the failure of a referendum in 1997.
	   Last March, then-Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar pardoned all
those involved in the kidnapping of Michal Kovac Jr., and those
responsible for the failure of a 1997 referendum on NATO membership
and how to select a president.
	   The Slovak president's son was kidnapped in Bratislava in August
1995 under suspicious circumstances and later found in front of an
Austrian police station.
	   The Slovak secret service SIS was rumored to have been involved
in the kidnapping.
	   A referendum in May 1977 was supposed to be a two-pronged poll
on NATO membership and how to elect the president. But a day before
voting started, Meciar ordered the vote restricted to NATO.
	   As a result, most Slovaks stayed away, and the ballot failed
because less than 10 percent of the voters took part. The former
interior minister, Gustav Krajci, was believed to have been behind
the move to limit the scope of the referendum.
	   ``Those that caused these things should not have thought that
the (Meciar's) amnesty will protect them forever,'' Dzurinda told
reporters on Tuesday.
	   Dzurinda said that the country needs to know if the SIS was
involved in these cases. ``Everybody in the country says they were
involved. It must be known, to either correct its reputation or to
find those involved, '' said Dzurinda.
	   Krajci is a member of parliament for Meciar's Movement for a
Democratic Slovakia, and therefore has immunity.
	   ``If it is proved thy were involved, than we will have to look
for a solution about their immunity as deputies,'' Dzurinda said.

Survey finds widespread use of muscle builder in Britain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A survey of British athletes has found widespread
use of creatine, the controversial dietary supplement marketed as a
legal alternative to anabolic steroids.
	   In a poll of elite men and women athletes conducted by The
Independent newspaper, nearly 57 percent said they had taken
creatine. Among weightlifters and rugby league players, the figure
was 100 percent.
	   Creatine is a substance found naturally in the body and in foods
such as meat and fish. Sold legally over the counter in synthetic
form as an amino acid powder, it helps build muscle and speeds
recovery from training.
	   Among those who have used creatine and hailed its benefits are
members of the England national soccer team and league and FA Cup
champion Arsenal, and track stars Linford Christie, Colin Jackson
and Sally Gunnell.
	   But some experts believe creatine could adverse long-term health
effects.
	   The Independent said some doctors suggest it causes kidney
damage, while others link it with shorter term problems such as
muscle cramping and dehydration.
	   ``During my time as a hospital doctor we used to measure the
level of creatine in the blood as an indicator of renal failure,''
Irish Sports Minister Jim McDaid said.
	   A recent investigation in Italy found widespread use of creatine
by Serie A soccer players. The Italian Olympic Committee's
anti-doping investigator, Ugo Longo, recommended in October that
creatine should be banned or restricted.
	   Creatine has experienced huge sales in Europe and the United
States. The Independent said sales in Britain are estimated at
around 20 million pounds (dlrs 32 million) a year, while sales in
the United States last year totaled about dlrs 100 million.
	   The International Olympic Committee, which does not include
creatine on its list of banned substances, is currently studying
the issue. IOC officials have said previously there is no reason to
ban creatine because it is a natural substance.
	   The Independent survey found that a majority of British athletes
belive their sport has a problem with drugs and most believe that
cheats are continuing to beat the system.

China makes good start in basketball
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ China's Zhang Jinsong had a game high
17 points as the defending Asian Games basketball men's champion
made a solid start to its title defense Tuesday.
	   China, seeking a fourth consecutive Asian games title, beat Hong
Kong 105-47 in pool A with Menk Batere dominant at both ends of the
court with 11 rebounds. Menk also scored 12 points.
	   China is aiming to equal the Philippines' record of four Asian
Games titles. The Philippines has made a concerted effort to
protect their record, drawing players out of the national pro
league for extensive build up, including a 22-day tour of the
United States.
	   The team made a labored start to pool D, edging Kazakstan 53-52.
	   Poor shooting cost Japan victory against the United Arab
Emirates in their pool C match. The UAE won a thriller 75-74
despite 25 points from Japan's Makoto Minamiyama. Japan shot at 40
percent to 50 percent by the UAE and 2.11-meter (6-feet 11-inches)
big man Hiroyuki Tominaga landed just one of eight shots from the
field.
	   South Korea scored a 84-75 win over Iran in their pool B match
while Taiwan beat Kazakstan 79-74 in the only women's match
Tuesday.

U.S. envoy shuttles between Eritrea and Ethiopia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ Former U.S. National Security
Advisor Anthony Lake shuttled between the Eritrean and Ethiopian
capitals Tuesday in a continuing bid to end the countries'
seven-month border dispute, officials said.
	   Ethiopian government spokeswoman Selome Taddesse said Lake
arrived in the capital Addis Ababa Tuesday and held a 30-minute
meeting with Prime Minister Meles Zenawi.
	   She did not disclose the content of their discussion.
	   The air tower in Asmara said Lake had left Addis Ababa and was
to return to Eritrea Tuesday afternoon.
	   On Sunday and Monday, Lake met in the Eritrean capital Asmara
with President Isaias Afewerki and top officials.
	   Eritrean and U.S. officials refused comment on the mission.
Eritrean presidential adviser Yemane Gebremeskel said the parties
involved had agreed to a news blackout.
	   Eritrea and Ethiopia were close allies until disagreement over
their undemarcated common border turned violent in May. Economic
quarrels between the two nations had also increased tensions prior
to the conflict.
	   Hundreds were killed in fighting at several fronts in May and
June. Since then, armies massed on both sides of the border have
continued to exchange sporadic shelling, with some civilian
casualties reported.
	   This is the third trip the U.S. team has made to the region in
recent months.
	   Lake, who is in the region at the request of President Bill
Clinton, arrived in Addis Ababa Dec. 4, and flew on Dec. 6 to
Asmara. He is to return to Washington D.C Friday.
	   An Organization of Africa Unity team led by the regional
agency's Secretary General Salim Ahmed Salim is expected to arrive
in Eritrea Saturday.
	   The OAU is going to Eritrea for clarification and consultation,
Gebremeskel said.
	   Both countries had been asked to submit their responses to
talking points outlined at an OAU summit held in early November in
Burkina Faso, which Ethiopia has accepted.
	   Eritrea rejects the key element demanding its forces withdraw
from the disputed Badme area to allow an Ethiopian administration
to return.
	   Both countries official responses will be considered by the
OAU's central organ for conflict resolution which is to meet
between Dec. 17 and 18 in Burkina Faso.

International Prosecutor to demand halt to Belgrade court's
</HEADLINE>
massacre probe &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ International war crimes
prosecutors want to stop a Yugoslav military court's investigation
into the role of three former Serb officers in a notorious 1991
massacre.
	   Louise Arbour, chief prosecutor of the Yugoslav War Crimes
Tribunal, will ask judges on Wednesday to order Belgrade
authorities to stop investigating the massacre and hand over any
evidence they have collected. She accused Belgrade of setting up
show proceedings to prevent the three from being extradited for
trial before the U.N. court in The Hague.
	   Given Yugoslavia's track record of defying the tribunal, the
case appears ``designed to shield the accused from international
criminal responsibility,'' Arbour wrote in documents released
Tuesday.
	   The officers were indicted by the tribunal in 1995 for allegedly
ordering the November 1991 massacre of 260 non-Serbs taken out of a
hospital in the Croatian city of Vukovar. The massacre victims are
believed to be Croat civilians, some of whom fought to defend
Vukovar during the Serb siege.
	   Vukovar was besieged and relentlessly shelled in 1991 during the
six-month war between Serbia and Croatia after Zagreb's declaration
of independence from the former Yugoslavia.
	   Former Yugoslav People's Army officers Mile Mrksic, Veselin
Slijvancanin and Miroslav Radic are due to testify on Dec. 17 as
part of the Yugoslav investigation.
	   Under the tribunal's statute, national courts must defer cases
to the tribunal if judges in The Hague order them to do so.
	   Yugoslavia steadfastly refuses to extradite the so-called
``Vukovar Three,'' despite international arrest warrants and
pressure from the U.N. Security Council.
	   Belgrade authorities accuse the tribunal of being anti-Serb and
claim that their constitution bars extraditing the officers. Serbia
is the dominant republic in Yugoslavia.

Annan warns against military intervention without U.N. approval
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos Planned
 &UR; By DEBORAH SEWARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ In an apparent warning to NATO, U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan told the French parliament Tuesday
that all military action by the international community must have
Security Council approval.
	   ``Doing it without its consent, as some are tempted to do, would
create an unfortunate precedent,'' Annan said, without naming any
specific organization or country.
	   French lawmakers applauded Annan's remarks, made in a speech to
the National Assembly as part of ceremonies marking the 50th
anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
	   ``It's important to stress that while regional organizations do,
undoubtedly, have an important role to play, any military
intervention by the international community must be approved by the
Security Council,'' Annan said.
	   A departure from this practice, Annan told his French audience,
would mean a ``return to a system of spheres of influence founded
on the individual interests of states rather than the principle of
shared responsibilities.''
	   Annan's remarks appeared to be directed at NATO, where during
the Kosovo crisis there was discussion of bypassing the Security
Council, and intervening directly, if U.N. approval were not
forthcoming.
	   NATO Secretary General Javier Solana suggested that the alliance
did not need U.N. backing to launch air strikes against Yugoslavia.
	   The threat of air strikes was being used to force Yugoslav
leader Slobodan Milosevic to remove some of his forces from Kosovo.
	   But some NATO members, particularly Germany, expressed
reservations about any military intervention by the alliance that
did not expressly have a green light by the Security Council.
	   And Russia, a member of the Security Council, made it clear that
it would not support a resolution authorizing air strikes.
	   The issue also came during the Iraq crisis, when U.S. officials
indicated they wouldn't need U.N. backing to intervene.
	   Annan's remarks came the same day that U.S. Secretary General
Madeleine Albright said in an interview that the alliance didn't
need U.N. approval for all its actions.
	   Asked whether NATO always have to have a specific U.N. mandate,
Albright told the influential daily Le Monde: ``No.''
	   ``It's clear that it's very good when NATO and the United
Nations can act together,'' Albright said. ``But the alliance
cannot be hostage of a veto of this or that country against an
operation. Because in such a case, NATO would be nothing more than
a branch of the United Nations.''

Euro bank chief: no risk of deflation despite slower growth
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL AMES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ European Central Bank President Wim
Duisenberg said Tuesday he saw no risk of deflation for the
European economy despite the expected slowdown of growth next year.
	   Duisenberg gave a generally sober assessment of the economic
situation in the 11 nations that adopt the euro as their common
currency on Jan. 1.
	   ``The risks are on the downside. Every single figure that
becomes available confirms that more and more,'' Duisenberg told a
European Parliament committee.
	   He said inflation was under control in the euro-zone. Although
the bank projected a rise from 1.2 percent to 1.6 percent next
year, he saw no danger of price increases exceeding the ECB's upper
limit of 2 percent.
	   Duisenberg said the threat of deflation, or falling prices,
brought about by an economic slump, was ``as much as an evil as
inflation,'' but he added ``at this time, there is no danger of
deflation.''
	   He forecast growth across the 11-nation bloc would slip to 2.4
percent next year, compared to 2.8 in 1998. Although a recovery is
predicted in 2000, Duisenberg said ``the uncertainties are too
great and the risks too large to attach too much importance to
that.''
	   Sluggish growth means, the euro-zone's persistently high
unemployment will dip only ``marginally'' from 11.8 percent to 11.2
in 1999, he said.
	   Duisenberg chastised euro-zone nations for not loosening rigid
labor market rules to help create jobs.
	   ``If governments really want to bring down their unemployment
rate, they must be willing to contribute to reform ... of markets,
particularly labor markets.''
	   He also expressed concern that euro-zone governments for not
striving hard enough to balance budgets.
	   Duisenberg reiterated the ECB plan to keep the key euro-zone
interest rate at the current 3 percent level for ``the foreseeable
future.'' He said sticking to the rate set last week by all the
euro-zone nations, expect Italy, will reduce market uncertainty.
	   ``We intend to keep them there for the foreseeable future ... to
give markets a sense of continuity and stability,'' he said.
However he added, ``how far we can foresee, I cannot tell you.''
	   On relations between the euro and the dollar, Duisenberg said he
was pleased with the recent lack of major exchange-rate swings and
expressed hope stability would continue after the euro's launch.
	   ``Volatility has been rather subdued, which I think is good for
the European and the U.S. economies.''

Clinton to light Christmas tree in Bethlehem this year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BETHLEHEM, West Bank (AP) _ President Bill Clinton will light
the Christmas tree in Manger Square when he visits the traditional
birthplace of Jesus, a senior Palestinian official said Tuesday.
	   During his stay in the Palestinian-ruled West Bank town Dec. 15,
Clinton will also tour the Church of the Nativity, built over the
grotto where tradition says Jesus was born, said the chief
Palestinian peace negotiator, Saeb Erekat.
	   Manger Square, where Clinton is to light the Christmas tree, is
undergoing major renovation, and the work will not be completed by
the time the president arrives, said Mayor Hanna Nasser.
	   A 30-foot deep hole the size of a swimming pool is gaping at one
end of a square where a tourism center is to be built in place of a
police station that served the city's various rulers. Wood, steel
rods and construction material are piled nearby.
	   Nasser said the repaving of Bethlehem's main road would be done
in time. ``School children waving Palestinian and American flags
will be brought out to welcome the president and the first lady,''
the mayor said.

The new NATO must go beyond its immediate borders
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. UPDATES throughout with fresh details, quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright said Tuesday NATO must be prepared to take action beyond
its borders and that suggestions this amounts to creating a new
``global NATO'' are ``hogwash.''
	   ``We are neither altering the North Atlantic Treaty nor
attempting to create some kind of a new `global NATO,''' she said.
``What we are doing is using the flexibility the treaty always
offered to adapt this alliance to the realities of a new strategic
environment...''
	   Albright was speaking to fellow NATO foreign ministers, gathered
here to discuss the major issues that will be presented to the
16-nation alliance's summit April 24-25 in Washington. Also
attending were ministers from Poland, Hungary and the Czech
Republic, which will become members next year.
	   One of the main summit issues will be updating NATO's strategic
concept, the military and political principles that define its
mission. In practice, that means updating theory to reflect what
NATO has been doing for years.
	   With the fall of the Berlin wall and the end of the Warsaw Pact,
the alliance has moved away from its strategy of defending against
a massive tank attack across Central Europe to new challenges, such
as regional conflicts, ethnic violence, terrorism and the spread of
weapons of mass destruction.
	   ``We must be prepared because we know that events beyond NATO's
immediate borders can affect vital alliance interests,'' Albright
said. ``This is why we acted in Bosnia. This is why we have come
together to prevent renewed violence in Kosovo.
	   ``Common sense tells us that it is sometimes better to deal with
instability when it is still at arms length that to wait until it
is at our doorstep.''
	   The central mission of NATO will always be collective defense,
but that doesn't preclude new missions.
	   ``One of the special qualities of the alliance has always been
its ability to react flexibly to new situations,'' said German
Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer. ``On the eve of the 21st century
we should ask ourselves if our instruments still match the changed
security environment.''
	   Albright rejected suggestions by some critics that taking on
these new missions would undermine NATO's original intent. ``I've
said it before; I will repeat it again today: this is hogwash,''
she said.
	   ``A ballistic missile attack using a weapon of mass destruction
from a rogue state is every bit as much a ... threat to our borders
now as a Warsaw Pact tank was two decades ago.''
	   Fischer made waves when he called on NATO last month to consider
dropping its doctrine allowing a nuclear first-strike. This
doctrine, reaffirmed as recently as last year, has always been a
part of NATO's nuclear strategy and is considered an important
aspect of deterrence.
	   The idea, long a plank in the platform of Fischer's Green Party,
doesn't win much support within the alliance, but many are willing
to discuss it.
	   ``Only in a climate of arms reduction can we fight against
weapons of mass destruction,'' Fischer told reporters. ``When we
succeed in reducing the significance of nuclear weapons, then we
will have achieved a lot.''
	   France, one of the alliance's three nuclear powers, is
unenthusiastic.
	   ``Our country has nothing against arms reduction,'' said French
Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine. ``At the same time, nuclear
deterrents tend to be considered in France as having helped
preserve peace.''
	   The ministers also deplored the continued violence in Kosovo,
where sporadic killings keep puncturing a shaky cease-fire between
Serb security forces and ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent
of the population.
	   NATO forced an end to the fighting with the threat of air
strikes and has dispatched a rapid reaction force to neighboring
Macedonia ready to intervene to protect the 2,000 civilian
cease-fire ``verifiers'' now deploying.
	   ``Kosovo is a critical test not only for NATO, but for Europe's
larger security structure,'' Albright said.
	   A statement from the ministers blamed both the Serb and ethnic
Albanian sides for the violence.
	   The ministers also agreed that the NATO-led multinational
peacekeeping force in Bosnia should be left at its current
32,000-troop level. A final decision will be made by defense
ministers at their meeting next week.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ An England-born Pakistani grabbed gold
and an ethnic Chinese snooker instructor from Malaysia took silver
in the Asian Games' newest sport _ snooker _ Tuesday, after top
players tumbled in major upsets.
	   ``This is the best game of my career,'' said Shokat Ali, 28,
after he defeated Sam Chong 7-6 in a marathon five-hour match.
	   ``This game is also the longest I have ever played in a
competition,'' said Ali, ranked 46th in the world,
	   Chong, who teaches snooker, fast becoming a popular sport in
Asia, said he lost concentration.
	   Chong took a 4-1 lead and appeared set on his road to gold, but
Ali bounced back and leveled the score. Chong led again, 6-5, and
Ali leveled again.
	   During the decisive game, a house fly got on to the table. Both
Chong and Ali made two futile attempts to shoo it away. Finally,
Ali smashed the fly with his hand and then took the victory,
smiling.
	   Earlier in the day, Ali who lives in Lancashire, England, won a
hard-fought semifinal against Malaysia's Ooi Chin Kay. Ali's 6
frame to 5 victory prevented an all-Malaysian final after Chong
beat Hong Kong's Chan Kwok-ming 6-2 in the other semifinal.
	   Ali was born in Blackburn, Lancashire, a county in northern
England where he still lives. He speaks English with a heavy
northern English accent as well as Punjabi and Urdu. His parents
are from Pakistan and he lived in Pakistan for five years.
	   On his road to gold, Chong had beaten Hung Chung-ming of Taiwan
5-2 in the round of 16 and then outlasted India's Yashin Merchant
5-4 in a night match lasting 3 hours, 10 minutes.
	   Ali was the fourth man through to the semis with a 5-2 win
against Keith E Boon Aun of Singapore.
	   Ooi and Chan had eliminated two of the favorites in earlier
rounds. Ooi beat Hong Kong's Marco Fu Ka-Chun, the only player to
hold the world senior and junior amateur titles concurrently, and
Chan had knocked out Thailand's James Wattana, a former World No.

Palestinians: Clinton will land at newly opened Gaza airport
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Despite Israeli objections, U.S. President Bill
Clinton has decided to touch down at Gaza International Airport,
Palestinian officials said, an act that would boost Palestinian
hopes for statehood.
	   But in a conciliatory gesture towards Israel, Clinton will land
by helicopter and not in Air Force One.
	   The Israelis have complained that a Clinton landing at the newly
opened Palestinian airport in the Gaza Strip would be tantamount to
recognition to an American approval of Palestinian intentions of
independence, something Israel opposes.
	   American officials have said they are leaning towards a
helicopter landing, although they say it is for technical and not
diplomatic reasons.
	   Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat called Clinton's land
at the Gaza International Airport on Dec. 14 ``a historical
precedent.'' Clinton arrives Saturday in Jerusalem. His visit was
planned as a celebration of the land-for-security agreement he
helped negotiate but has since been marred by bitter disputes and a
suspension of the talks called by Israel.
	   The Palestinians consider the airport, their first gateway to
the world, a strong symbol of fledgling independence. It opened
last month with great ceremony and cheer after more than two years
of disputes between Israel and the Palestinians over security
arrangements.

Officials: Heads of four kidnapped foreigners found

<TEXT>
	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ Chechen authorities found the decapitated
heads of four kidnapped foreigners Tuesday near a remote village
after a two-month search in the breakaway region in southern
Russia.
	   An Associated Press reporter saw the severed heads near the
village of Assinovskaya, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) west of
Grozny, the Chechen capital. He did not see any sign of the bodies.
	   The heads were identified as those of the four abducted
foreigners by Umar Makhauri, who had been a bodyguard assigned to
the four when they were abducted Oct. 3 by unidentified gunmen in
Grozny. He said the bodies had not been found.
	   But Chechen government officials at the scene said four bodies
had been found without giving further details. Chechen President
Aslan Maskhadov said in Grozny that the bodies of four men had been
recovered.
	   The hostages _ Britons Peter Kennedy, Darren Hickey, and Rudolf
Petschi, and New Zealand's Stanley Shaw _ were engineers. They were
working for Granger Telecom, a British telephone company,
installing 300,000 telephone lines across Chechnya.
	   Maskhadov said Chechen officials had caught one of the captors
Monday and he told police where the hostages were being held. But
that information reached the other captors, who decided to kill
their captives, the ITAR-Tass news agency quoted Maskhadov as
saying.
	   The chief executive of Granger Telecom, Ray Verth, said Tuesday
that Chechen authorities had mounted a rescue attempt Monday night
that went ``tragically wrong.'' No other details were available.
	   He said the company had ``opened a dialogue with the kidnappers
and received confirmation that the hostages were alive as recently
as last week.''
	   ``Their murder is an appalling and barbaric act and our thoughts
go out to the families to whom we offer our deepest condolences. We
are a small tightly-knit company and everyone here is in a state of
shock,'' Verth said outside company headquarters in Weybridge,
south of London, where flags were flying at half-mast.
	   Spokesmen at the British and New Zealand embassies in Moscow
said they were checking on reports the four men had been killed,
but could not comment. The British Foreign Ministry in London said
it was investigating urgently reports that bodies had been found.
	   Chechen acting First Vice Premier Turpal Atgeriyev, who is
heading the investigation into the killings, said authorities had
several suspects in the abduction, but have failed to make any
progress, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Eamon Hickey, the father of one of the missing men, said he
heard the news and was hoping it would not be confirmed.
	   ``There is so much rumor and counter-rumor coming from out there
that we don't know what to think. Obviously we are hoping and
praying that it does not turn out to be true,'' he said at his home
in England.
	   Chechen authorities had been searching for the missing men for
the past two months. British officials said they had not received
any ransom demand for the missing men.
	   Maskhadov said the deaths of the four men were a major blow to
Chechnya and its efforts to gain international recognition of its
independence. He blamed the rash of abductions in Chechnya to
unidentified ``outside forces'' and their Chechen henchmen.
	   ``I am ready to answer before my people and the whole world for
what happened,'' he was quoted as saying by the Interfax news
agency.
	   Hostage-takings, usually for ransom, have become common in
Chechnya since the end of the breakaway republic's two-year war for
independence from Russia in 1996. But victims are rarely killed.
	   Since the beginning of 1998, 176 people have been kidnapped in
the North Caucasus region of Russia, including dozens of
foreigners, and 90 of them released, officials have said.

Bermuda's attorney general to quit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HAMILTON, Bermuda (AP) _ Bermuda's attorney general said Tuesday
he will leave his post on Friday and return to his private practice
in Barbados.
	   Elliott Mottley's contract expired in June, but he had accepted
a dlrs 30,000 bonus on top of his dlrs 125,000 salary to stay on
through the British territory's general elections in November.
	   Unlike most British possessions, in which the attorney general
is appointed by the prime minister, Bermuda has traditionally hired
its attorney general through its public service system.
	   Newly elected premier Jennifer Smith said she intended to
appoint an attorney general in order to mirror the British system.
	   The attorney general prosecutes criminal cases, represents the
government in civil actions and gives legal advice to government
agencies.

Rwanda demobilizes 3,000 soldiers, denies forceful round up

	   GABIRO, Rwanda (AP) _ The Rwandan army on Tuesday discharged
more than 3,000 officers and soldiers in a bid to cut costs, but
said the demobilization will not affect the country's security.
	   ``If we were not facing insecurity in northwestern Rwanda and
war in Congo, all those wishing to leave would be allowed to do
so,'' Maj. Gen. Paul Kagame, vice president and minister of
defense, told the 3,639 people waiting to return to civilian life.
	   International donors financing almost half of Rwanda's dlrs 330
million 1999 budget are scrutinizing its military expenditure,
which is below 30 percent of the budget.
	   The government has agreed with the donors to cut its force from
the current 35,000 troops to 19,000 men by 2001, creating a
smaller, professional army that will be cheaper to train and
maintain.
	   The Rwandan Patriotic Army grew out of the Tutsi-led rebel force
that won power in July 1994 and put an end to a Hutu
government-organized genocide of more than 500,000 people.
	   It is still fighting defeated Hutu soldiers and militiamen, who
are conducting an insurgency in northwestern Rwanda, often from
bases across the border in eastern Congo.
	   In August, Rwanda sent troops and arms to Congo in support of
Congolese rebels fighting to oust President Laurent Kabila.
	   Kagame said on Sunday Rwandan troops will remain in Congo until
security along its borders is guaranteed, and accused Kabila of
recruiting thousands of Hutu fighters who had fled Rwanda in fear
of reprisals for the 1994 slaughter.
	   ``Rwanda has enough soldiers to take care of its security,''
Kagame said Tuesday at the Gabiro military camp, 100 kilometers (60
miles) northeast of Kigali.
	   Earlier, Kagame rejected criticism that the army was recruiting
additional troops for Congo, where they are facing a
counteroffensive by the Congolese government and its allies from
Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia and Chad.
	   He said the recruitment was halted several months ago because of
budgetary constraints, and promised to continue the troop
demobilization, cutting costs on uniforms and salaries and allowing
the purchase of weapons.
	   Among those demobilized Tuesday were war-handicapped, elderly,
those wanting to leave the army, and soldiers not meeting the new
army's skill requirements.
	   ``I was wounded in the leg which was amputated in 1993,'' said
2nd Lt. Bosse Rwemaloike. ``Now I want to continue my education,
which I interrupted to join the struggle. Competition in civilian
life is tight, so I have to catch up.'
	   Ephraim Kabaija, head of the Rwanda Demobilization and
Reintegration Commission, appealed to foreign donors at the
ceremony to help finance the demobilization program. Out of dlrs 10
million pledged for the program, only half has been disbursed.
	   Each of the demobilized men, including four colonels, will
receive 300,000 Rwandan francs (dlrs 1,000) in increments over
several months.

Ukrainian city officials propose payments for elevators
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ City officials in Ukraine's port of Odessa
have found an original way to boost their dwindling budget: make
residents of high-rise buildings pay for the use of elevators.
	   Under the proposal, devised by Odessa's department for servicing
elevators, each resident who lives above the third floor would pay
1.3 hryvna (40 cents) a month for the use of elevators, the daily
Segodnya reported Tuesday.
	   Department chief Mykola Rublia told Segodnya that his plan would
soon be debated by the city council.
	   It was unclear how many people would be willing to pay the fee.
Many residents of the Black Sea port city _ like Ukrainians
nationwide _ don't even have the money to pay customary municipal
fees.
	   In October, for instance, Ukrainians paid only 57 percent of
these fees, according to the State Statistics Committee.

Kosovo rebels reject U.S. peace draft

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout NATO statement. TRIMS outdated material. No

 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC;

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The chief spokesman for Kosovo's
rebels rejected the latest peace plan for the troubled province
Tuesday, and demanded the removal of its American architect for
alleged pro-Serb bias.
	   But in Brussels, Belgium, NATO foreign ministers endorsed U.S.
diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis and called on Serbs and
ethnic Albanians to ``move rapidly in a spirit of compromise and
accommodation.''
	   The ministers also reaffirmed that any settlement must respect
the territorial integrity of Yugoslavia, putting them at odds with
the ethnic Albanians seeking independence for the majority Albanian
province.
	   Rebel spokesman Adem Demaci said that the latest peace plan
drafted by U.S. envoy Christopher Hill was unacceptable because it
doesn't envisage what will happen to the rebel Kosovo Liberation
Army.
	   ``Mr. Hill either doesn't understand the Albanian problems, or
he is leaning toward the Serbs,'' Demaci said. ``The State
Department should reconsider the results of his work ... (and) send
us more qualified people.''
	   Demaci also acknowledged that the KLA was using lull in the
fighting to rearm and prepare for more battles with government
troops.
	   ``The KLA has no illusion that the (Serb) regime will
democratize overnight and that it will give up trying to find a
solution through force for the Kosovo crisis,'' he said. ``It would
be dangerous if the Albanians don't continue arming themselves and
preparing for resistance.''
	   Hundreds of people were killed and almost 300,000 ethnic
Albanians forced from their homes in a seven-month crackdown on
separatists by Serbian forces before an October peace accord.
	   In a statement issued in Brussels, NATO foreign ministers
deplored the violence in Kosovo, blaming both Serbs and ethnic
Albanians.
	   ``Since the beginning of November, violent incidents provoked in
some cases by Serbian security forces and in others by armed
Kosovar elements have increased tension,'' the ministers said.
``(Both sides) have failed to comply fully with the requirements
set on in U.N. Security Council resolutions.''
	   The NATO ministers reaffirmed their support for a political
solution ``which provides an enhanced status for Kosovo, a
substantially greater degree of autonomy and meaningful
self-administration'' but which ``preserves the territorial
integrity'' of Yugoslavia.
	   The Americans and Europeans fear independence would lead to
similar demands by other ethnic Albanian communities elsewhere in
the southern Balkans.
	   The U.S.-based Human Rights Watch, meanwhile, claimed today that
more than 1,000 Kosovo Albanians were in Serbian prisons and police
stations, and said at least five have died from beatings and
torture.
	   The statement, faxed to The Associated Press in Belgrade, said
hundreds of others have been injured from beatings and torture.

Finnish cigar maker capitalizes on Clinton's sex scandal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ President Clinton may want to forget
all about cigars and the name Monica Lewinsky. But a Finnish ferry
line is making sure cigar buffs don't.
	   Viking Line is selling Lewinsky cigars on passenger ferries that
ply the Baltic Sea, and reportedly they're going up in smoke.
	   ``The order from Viking Lines was a lifesaver for us,'' Johan
Sundqvist, managing director of the J. Sundqvist Cigar Factory,
said Tuesday.
	   The company, situated in Parainen _ 170 kilometers (105 miles)
west of Helsinki _ has six workers and stopped its normal
production to meet the 4,000 Lewinsky cigar order by Christmas.
	   ``I don't know much about the sex scandal; I just do my job,''
said Anne Rautio, who handrolls the Lewinsky cigars. ``For me, it's
just another cigar.''
	   Johan Eriksson, a sales manager at Viking Lines, denied that the
idea of selling a Lewinsky cigar was in bad taste.
	   ``The Lewinsky is a good, tasty cigar and it's selling well,''
Eriksson said, but declined to give sales figures. ``Also, we
wanted to help the domestic cigar industry.''

Officials: Heads of four kidnapped foreigners found

<TEXT>
	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ Chechen authorities found the decapitated
heads of four kidnapped foreigners Tuesday near a remote village
after a two-month search in the breakaway region in southern
Russia.
	   An Associated Press reporter saw the severed heads near the
village of Assinovskaya, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) west of
Grozny, the Chechen capital. He did not see any sign of the bodies.
	   The heads were identified as those of the four abducted
foreigners by Umar Makhauri, who had been a bodyguard assigned to
the four when they were abducted Oct. 3 by unidentified gunmen in
Grozny. He said the bodies had not been found.
	   But Chechen government officials at the scene said four bodies
had been found without giving further details. Chechen President
Aslan Maskhadov said in Grozny that the bodies of four men had been
recovered.
	   The hostages _ Britons Peter Kennedy, Darren Hickey, and Rudolf
Petschi, and New Zealand's Stanley Shaw _ were engineers. They were
working for Granger Telecom, a British telephone company,
installing 300,000 telephone lines across Chechnya.
	   Maskhadov said Chechen officials had caught one of the captors
Monday and he told police where the hostages were being held. But
that information reached the other captors, who decided to kill
their captives, the ITAR-Tass news agency quoted Maskhadov as
saying.
	   The chief executive of Granger Telecom, Ray Verth, said Tuesday
that Chechen authorities had mounted a rescue attempt Monday night
that went ``tragically wrong.'' No other details were available.
	   He said the company had ``opened a dialogue with the kidnappers
and received confirmation that the hostages were alive as recently
as last week.''
	   ``Their murder is an appalling and barbaric act and our thoughts
go out to the families to whom we offer our deepest condolences. We
are a small tightly-knit company and everyone here is in a state of
shock,'' Verth said outside company headquarters in Weybridge,
south of London, where flags were flying at half-mast.
	   Spokesmen at the British and New Zealand embassies in Moscow
said they were checking on reports the four men had been killed,
but could not comment. The British Foreign Ministry in London said
it was investigating urgently reports that bodies had been found.
	   Chechen acting First Vice Premier Turpal Atgeriyev, who is
heading the investigation into the killings, said authorities had
several suspects in the abduction, but have failed to make any
progress, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Eamon Hickey, the father of one of the missing men, said he
heard the news and was hoping it would not be confirmed.
	   ``There is so much rumor and counter-rumor coming from out there
that we don't know what to think. Obviously we are hoping and
praying that it does not turn out to be true,'' he said at his home
in England.
	   Chechen authorities had been searching for the missing men for
the past two months. British officials said they had not received
any ransom demand for the missing men.
	   Maskhadov said the deaths of the four men were a major blow to
Chechnya and its efforts to gain international recognition of its
independence. He blamed the rash of abductions in Chechnya to
unidentified ``outside forces'' and their Chechen henchmen.
	   ``I am ready to answer before my people and the whole world for
what happened,'' he was quoted as saying by the Interfax news
agency.
	   Hostage-takings, usually for ransom, have become common in
Chechnya since the end of the breakaway republic's two-year war for
independence from Russia in 1996. But victims are rarely killed.
	   Since the beginning of 1998, 176 people have been kidnapped in
the North Caucasus region of Russia, including dozens of
foreigners, and 90 of them released, officials have said.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin remained out of sight at a
Kremlin hospital Tuesday, leaving Russia's political establishment
to chew over his latest high-profile staff dismissals.
	   ``Yeltsin has broken away from the doctors' watch and again
shown he won't let anyone bury him,'' the liberal daily Segodnya
said, putting the brightest possible spin on the president's
decision to fire several senior aides.
	   Others were less charitable.
	   ``He is not governing anything any longer,'' Communist Party
leader Gennady Zyuganov said. ``This is simply an agony.''
	   Yeltsin, hospitalized since Nov. 22 with pneumonia, emerged
briefly Monday to fire Chief of Staff Valentin Yumashev and three
of his deputies. The president then returned to the hospital.
	   Yeltsin's spokesman said the president fired Yumashev for
failing to stem crime and for reacting too mildly to a Communist
parliament deputy's anti-Semitic remarks. But most people assumed
the aide was axed for speaking too candidly about Yeltsin's
declining health.
	   Yumashev has said Yeltsin was too weak to handle the day-to-day
responsibilities of his job.
	   ``In a situation when the presidential inner circle starts
speaking about the boss as if he were a political outsider, you
have to replace either the president, or his aides,'' the business
daily Kommersant said Tuesday. ``Yeltsin has chosen the second.''
	   Presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said doctors allowed the
president to take brief walks around the hospital grounds Tuesday
for the first time since he was hospitalized with pneumonia on Nov.
22.
	   ``That means he is on the way to recovery,'' Yakushkin was
quoted as saying by the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Yakushkin said Yeltsin was working on documents, but had no
meetings planned and would remain hospitalized as long as necessary
to recuperate.
	   ``Pneumonia is an illness that requires a serious treatment and
a certain regime,'' he said.
	   Yeltsin has been a part-time president for months as his health
has declined. He has played little role in Russia's pressing
economic problems. The Russian economy slumped earlier this year,
partly in response to Asia's economic travails, and plummeted after
Aug. 17, when the government devalued the ruble and temporarily
froze foreign debt payments.
	   Yeltsin fired almost his entire cabinet as a result of that
decision.

Moi blames high level corruption for worsening economy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ President Daniel arap Moi said Tuesday
that in the coming year Kenya will face deepening economic crisis
because of the rampant corruption in all the government ministries.
	   ``Despite the fact there is global economic recession facing
South Asia, Europe and Russia, the situation in Kenya is more
serious than ever before,'' Moi said at Kisii town in Western
Kenya, about 600 kilometers (375 miles) northwest of the capital
Nairobi.
	   Kenya is rife with high level corruption to such an extent that
the International Monetary Fund last year suspended a dlrs 220
million dollar loan to the country until it can clean up the graft.
	   Last May, Finance Minister Simeon Nyachae announced the
government was broke and said a major reason was customs officials
taking bribes not to collect duties on imported goods.
	   Moi warned Tuesday that any civil servant caught in corrupt
handling of funds will face a life sentence in prison.
	   ``I have today directed the police to track down on the economic
saboteurs and the law will be applied sternly,'' he said.
	   ``Government officers who have perpetuated corruption in various
ways are to take full responsibility.''
	   Since coming to power in 1978, President Daniel arap Moi has
regularly promised to tackle corruption.

	   SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) _ Spacewalking astronauts
successfully hooked up 40 electrical connections between the first
two pieces of the international space station on Monday, allowing
power and data to flow from one side to the other.
	   To NASA's surprise, the critical wiring job took less time than
expected.
	   Jerry Ross, NASA's most experienced spacewalker, deftly snapped
the connectors together as James Newman handed him the attached
cables. They were impressed with the seven-story station towering
above them.
	   ``This is sure a beautiful piece of hardware,'' Newman said.
	   Ross worked nonstop from the end of Endeavour's 50-foot robot
arm, starting at the bottom with the American-made Unity module. He
attached jumper cables there before being hoisted more than 40 feet
to the Russian-built Zarya stacked on top.
	   ``Jerry, how's the view?'' Newman called out from below.
	   ``Fantastic if I had time to look,'' Ross replied.
	   Ross and Newman completed the electrical connections four hours
into their nearly 7{-hour spacewalk, the first of three scheduled
for this week. Before the astronauts went back inside the shuttle,
flight controllers turned on the power inside the fledgling
station; electricity had been shut off to the cables before the
spacewalk, for the astronauts' safety.
	   Endeavour's crew used the robot arm and thruster rockets Sunday
to snap together Zarya and Unity, forming a 77-foot, 35-ton tower
in Endeavour's cargo bay. Construction of the space station hinged
on making the electrical hookups, said NASA's lead flight director,
Bob Castle.
	   Unity, a connecting passageway, needs the solar power generated
by the Zarya control module to survive. The computers, heaters and
fans inside Unity began humming for the first time in orbit once
the electricity started flowing from Zarya.
	   Working 240 miles above Earth, Ross and Newman had 135 tools at
their disposal and a horde of engineers standing by in two
countries to offer advice. The spacewalkers tied the most important
tools to a pole that jutted from the top of the robot arm _ a
floating tool belt. Newman also strapped a set to his waist; the
tools stretched out behind him as he used a newly installed slide
wire to get from one end of the stack to the other.
	   Newman had the more unwieldy job, Ross the more hand-intensive.
	   It was up to Newman to unclamp the 20- to 30-foot power cables
and hand them, one at a time, to Ross to link to the mate on the
other side. At times, cables seemed to float every which way _ an
octopus, the spacewalkers laughingly called it. The colder the
cables, the stiffer they became, making it difficult for Ross to
join them.
	   Before locking the connectors together, Ross inspected each end
to make sure the dozens of tiny pins inside were not bent or caked
with debris. He handled the connectors gently so as not to damage
them. Each was numbered so there would be no mistakes.
	   Despite the interfering cold, the work went quickly.
	   ``Looking good, man,'' Ross told Newman, ``keep it coming.''
	   The astronauts worked so fast they were able to squeeze in a few
additional tasks, including installing hand and tool rails for
future assembly crews. In a rare bungle, a socket for one rail got
away from Ross, but Newman offered him a spare.
	   Each man's spacesuit was equipped with a mini jetpack in case
their safety lines to the shuttle broke. Endeavour is so loaded
that it would be difficult for it to dash after a runaway
spacewalker.
	   NASA deliberately picked two pros for the job and, even then,
had both men go through 200 hours of training underwater, the
closest approximation to weightlessness on Earth.
	   Ross, 50, a husky Air Force colonel, has made four previous
spacewalks and also has real construction experience. He worked in
a steel mill and did highway construction work back in his college
days.
	   The taller, thinner Newman, a 42-year-old physicist, conducted a
station-practice spacewalk in 1993.

Government gives money to aid homeless in cold spell
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ With the death toll from more than three
weeks of freezing weather at 91 on Tuesday, the government has
given 5 million zlotys (dlrs 1.5 million) to groups that help the
homeless.
	   Government spokesman Jaroslaw Sellin said the money from
Treasury reserves went to non-government organizations and shelters
for the homeless.
	   Most of the dead from the cold front that arrived Nov. 16 were
drunken men who passed out in the frigid conditions, police say.
Many of the victims were homeless.
	   Shelters for the homeless have been overcrowded and running low
on money. Due to the numbers seeking shelter, welfare groups have
changed their policy and taken in drunken people.
	   The lowest temperature recorded during the cold spell was minus
26 Celsius (minus 4 Fahrenheit). Temperatures have risen this week,
hovering around minus 5 Celsius (23 Fahrenheit) with steady
snowfall in several areas.
	   Police say the death toll from the cold front already far
exceeds the 54 deaths attributed to the cold last winter.

Officials: Heads of four kidnapped foreigners found
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in grafs 6-9 with hostages reportedly killed Monday,

Maskhadov. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ Chechen authorities found the decapitated
heads of four kidnapped foreigners Tuesday near a remote village
after a two-month search in the breakaway region in southern
Russia.
	   An Associated Press reporter saw the severed heads near the
village of Assinovskaya, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) west of
Grozny, the Chechen capital. He did not see any sign of the bodies.
	   The heads were identified as those of the four abducted
foreigners by Umar Makhauri, who had been a bodyguard assigned to
the four when they were abducted Oct. 3 by unidentified gunmen in
Grozny. He said the bodies had not been found.
	   But Chechen government officials at the scene said four bodies
had been found without giving further details. Chechen President
Aslan Maskhadov said in Grozny that the bodies of four men had been
recovered.
	   The hostages _ Britons Peter Kennedy, Darren Hickey, and Rudolf
Petschi, and New Zealand's Stanley Shaw _ were engineers. They were
working for Granger Telecom, a British telephone company,
installing 300,000 telephone lines across Chechnya.
	   Maskhadov said Chechen officials had caught one of the captors
Monday and he told police where the hostages were being held. But
that information reached the other captors, who decided to kill
their captives, the ITAR-Tass news agency quoted Maskhadov as
saying.
	   The chief executive of Granger Telecom, Ray Verth, said Tuesday
that Chechen authorities had mounted a rescue attempt Monday night
that went ``tragically wrong.'' No other details were available.
	   He said the company had ``opened a dialogue with the kidnappers
and received confirmation that the hostages were alive as recently
as last week.''
	   ``Their murder is an appalling and barbaric act and our thoughts
go out to the families to whom we offer our deepest condolences. We
are a small tightly-knit company and everyone here is in a state of
shock,'' Verth said outside company headquarters in Weybridge,
south of London, where flags were flying at half-mast.
	   Spokesmen at the British and New Zealand embassies in Moscow
said they were checking on reports the four men had been killed,
but could not comment. The British Foreign Ministry in London said
it was investigating urgently reports that bodies had been found.
	   Chechen acting First Vice Premier Turpal Atgeriyev, who is
heading the investigation into the killings, said authorities had
several suspects in the abduction, but have failed to make any
progress, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Eamon Hickey, the father of one of the missing men, said he
heard the news and was hoping it would not be confirmed.
	   ``There is so much rumor and counter-rumor coming from out there
that we don't know what to think. Obviously we are hoping and
praying that it does not turn out to be true,'' he said at his home
in England.
	   Chechen authorities had been searching for the missing men for
the past two months. British officials said they had not received
any ransom demand for the missing men.
	   Maskhadov said the deaths of the four men were a major blow to
Chechnya and its efforts to gain international recognition of its
independence. He blamed the rash of abductions in Chechnya to
unidentified ``outside forces'' and their Chechen henchmen.
	   ``I am ready to answer before my people and the whole world for
what happened,'' he was quoted as saying by the Interfax news
agency.
	   Hostage-takings, usually for ransom, have become common in
Chechnya since the end of the breakaway republic's two-year war for
independence from Russia in 1996. But victims are rarely killed.
	   Since the beginning of 1998, 176 people have been kidnapped in
the North Caucasus region of Russia, including dozens of
foreigners, and 90 of them released, officials have said.

NATO foreign ministers to forge new strategic concept
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ With the lessons of Bosnia and Kosovo
as a backdrop, NATO begins forging a new strategic concept Tuesday,
moving beyond the traditional tasks of collective defense to focus
on weapons of mass destruction, terrorism and regional conflicts.
	   NATO foreign minsters will meet to update the strategic concept,
which lays out the alliance's mission, to reflect what NATO already
has been doing in practice since the fall of the Berlin wall a
decade ago. The concept was last revised in 1991.
	   ``NATO's primary mission will always remain defense against
aggression,'' Secretary of State Madeleine Albright wrote Monday in
Britain's Financial Times. ``But the founders of the alliance also
distinguished between what the treaty commits us to do and what it
permits us to do.''
	   Today's threat is not a Russian tank assault across the plains
of central Europe, but regional and ethnic violence like in Bosnia
and Kosovo, terrorism and the spread of weapons of mass
destruction. When these threats originate from outside NATO's
traditional territory of operations, the alliance must be prepared
to deal with them.
	   ``The challenge is to bring the strategy into line with the
changing reality,'' said a senior NATO diplomat briefing reporters
before the foreign ministers' meeting here Tuesday and Wednesday.
	   The ministers will draw up the concept for approval at the NATO
summit on April 24-25. That summit, marking the alliance's 50th
anniversary, will also welcome three new members, Poland, Hungary
and the Czech Republic.
	   Albright will table a proposal at the ministerial meeting here
to set up a Center for Weapons of Mass Destruction, essentially an
intelligence-sharing center, officials said.
	   Germany, meanwhile, is expected to bring up the nuclear
first-strike question.
	   German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer made waves when he
called on NATO last month to consider dropping its doctrine
allowing a nuclear first-strike. This doctrine, reaffirmed as
recently as last year, has always been a part of NATO's nuclear
strategy and is considered an important aspect of deterrence.
	   ``The minister will certainly raise the issue,'' a German
diplomatic source said. ``We have to see that in the context of
arms control, arms reduction and nonproliferation.''
	   The Germans don't have much backing on the issue and no one at
NATO sees it as more than a speed bump on the road to the new
strategic concept.
	   The allies will assess the situation in Kosovo, the south
Serbian province where Serb security forces and ethnic Albanian
guerrillas clashed for seven months. The threat of NATO air strikes
stopped the fighting in October and the cease-fire is generally
holding, despite sporadic outbursts.
	   The ministers also will make a regular six-month review of the
situation in Bosnia. While there may be some cosmetic changes in
the 32,000-member NATO-led force in Bosnia, no major reduction in
the troop level is seen any time soon.
	   ``Bosnia and Kosovo are recent examples that demonstrate NATO
must act when conflicts beyond its immediate borders affect
alliance interests,'' Albright wrote in her Financial Times
article. ``NATO must find the right balance between the centrality
of NATO's collective defense missions and responding to such
crises.''

NATO revising strategy in line with changes in Europe
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO foreign ministers began the
process Tuesday of revising the 16-nation alliance's strategic
concept, the military and political principles that guide the NATO
mission.
	   The ministers are laying the groundwork for the 50th anniversary
NATO summit in Washington April 24-25, where leaders are expected
to approve the alliance's strategy for the 21st century and welcome
three new members, Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, into the
fold.
	   ``One of the special qualities of the alliance has always been
its ability to react flexibly to new situations,'' German Foreign
Minister Joschka Fischer told fellow ministers. ``On the eve of the
21st century we should ask ourselves if our instruments still match
the changed security environment.''
	   Today's threat is no longer a Russian tank assault across the
plains of Central Europe, but challenges from regional conflicts
like Bosnia and Kosovo, terrorism and the spread of weapons of mass
destruction. When these threats originate from outside NATO's
traditional territory of operations, the alliance must be prepared
to deal with them.
	   In practice, NATO has already adjusted to these new realities,
intervening in Bosnia, halting the humanitarian disaster in Kosovo
with the threat of airstrikes, sending soldiers just across the
Kosovo border in Macedonia to rescue civilian cease-fire monitors
if needed.
	   ``NATO is already acting out of area, so let's not dramatize
that,'' said NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana.
	   Added British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook: ``I think we have to
be pragmatic and grown up about this. That will require making a
judgment on a case-by-case basis.''
	   Cook stressed the increased role that the Europeans want to play
in continental security, particularly in cases where the United
States is less interested in participating. NATO is developing a
policy it calls the European Security and Defense Identity to deal
with that, but France and Britain are pressing for the European
Union to play a role too.
	   ``The focus must be strengthening and improving the European
security identity,'' Cook said, stressing nonetheless that ``NATO
will remain the basis for territorial defense for the EU.''
	   Solana said the European Union economic alliance is changing and
NATO's plans must be adapted to the changes. ``We are trying to
reconcile these things.''
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, writing in the
British newspaper The Financial Times, said: ``NATO's primary
mission will always remain defense against aggression. But the
founders of the alliance also distinguished between what the treaty
commits us to do and what it permits us to do.''
	   She said Bosnia and Kosovo are recent examples ``that
demonstrate NATO must act when conflicts beyond its immediate
borders affect alliance interests. NATO must find the right balance
between the centrality of NATO's collective defense missions and
responding to such crises.''
	   NATO's central mission will always be collective defense and the
concept that an attack against one member is an aggression against
all. But attacks against members now take different forms and often
originate far away.
	   Albright planned to propose at the ministerial meeting here
setting up a Center for Weapons of Mass Destruction, essentially on
how to best share and use intelligence, officials said.
	   The Germans plan to bring up the nuclear first-strike question
later in the meeting.
	   Fischer made waves when he called on NATO last month to consider
dropping its doctrine allowing a nuclear first-strike. This
doctrine, reaffirmed as recently as last year, has always been a
part of NATO's nuclear strategy and is considered an important
aspect of deterrence.
	   ``The minister will certainly raise the issue,'' a German
diplomatic source said. ``We have to see that in the context of
arms control, arms reduction and nonproliferation.''
	   The Germans don't have much backing on the issue, however.
	   The allies assessed the situation in Kosovo, where Serb security
forces and ethnic Albanian guerrillas clashed for seven months. The
threat of a NATO airstrike stopped the fighting in October and the
cease-fire is generally holding, while U.S.mediator Christopher
Hill attempts to firm the peace with political agreement.
	   The ministers also made their six-monthly review of the
situation in Bosnia. No major reduction in the 32,000-troop level
in the NATO-led peacekeeping force is expected soon.

<TEXT>
	   PREDAZZO, Italy (AP) _ Germany's Martin Schmitt beat double
Olympic champion Kazuyoshi Funaki in Tuesday's ski jumping event at
Predazzo to clinch his fourth season victory and hold a commanding
lead in the overall World Cup standings.
	   Schmitt, with jumps of 128.5 and 125 meters from the 120-meter
hill, totaled 253.7 points to edge Funaki by 3.7 points.
	   Funaki, who jumped 121.5 and 126 meters, led teammates Noriaki
Kasai and Kazuya Yoshioka who placed third and fourth respectively
in an impressive showing by the Japanese team.
	   Norway's Lasse Ottesen edged another Japanese jumper, Masahiko
Harada, for fifth place.
	   Schmitt, who placed third to Finland's Janne Ahonen and Funaki
at Chamonix in the only World Cup event he did not win so far this
season, piled up 460 points overall, compared with Ahonen's 372 and
Funaki's 330.
	   Funaki extended his winless streak to five events as he finished
second for the second time in three days.
	   Other top finishers included Norway's Morten Aagheim (7th),
Ahonen (8th) and Germany's Sven Hannawald (9th).
	   Austrian great Andreas Goldberger ended tenth.
	   The event was held in the north Italian resort which will host
the world nordic events championships in 2003.
	   The next World Cup round is scheduled at Oberhof, Germany, this
weekend.

Paris bids to stage 2008 Olympics

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Paris is entering the crowded race for the 2008
Olympics.
	   President Jacques Chirac phoned IOC president Juan Antonio
Samaranch to confirm the city's bid to stage the games, the French
Olympic Committee said Tuesday.
	   Paris is the latest in a long list of cities announcing their
candidacy for the games.
	   Other candidates so far include Beijing; Toronto; Kuala Lumpur,
Malaysia; Buenos Aires, Argentina; Istanbul, Turkey; Osaka, Japan,
and Seville, Spain. Cairo is also weighing a possible bid.
	   China is considered the early strong favorite. Beijing, which
lost narrowly to Sydney in the race for the 2000 games, announced a
bid last week.
	   There had been speculation that Paris would not submit a bid if
China entered the race. But there is a strong body of opinion that
cities rarely win an Olympic bid at the first attempt and it's
advisable to get into position for a successful run four years
later.
	   With Athens hosting the 2004 Olympics, the International Olympic
Committee is likely to choose a non-European city in 2008. Paris
could be in a strong position for 2012.
	   The IOC will open the bidding next year and select the 2008 host
city in Moscow in 2001.

Palestinian militants to meet to oppose charter's amendment
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Israel-Palestinians &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Palestinian hard-liners are to meet in
Syria this weekend to affirm their allegiance to a charter that
calls for Israel's destruction _ and to reject Yasser Arafat's move
to amend the document.
	   ``The meeting will express our rejection of peace agreements
with Israel, counter Arafat's plan to give legitimacy to Israel's
occupation of our lands, and reiterate our support for the
Palestinian charter,'' hard-liner Bahjat Abu Gharbiyeh told The
Associated Press in Amman.
	   Gharbiyeh, a former member of the Palestine National Council,
effectively the Palestinians' parliament, is leading a group of 67
Jordanian-based delegates to the Dec. 12 conference.
	   More than 300 delegates are expected to attend the meeting
called by 10 Damascus-based groups at Youth City, Damascus. Other
delegates are expected from Egypt, Lebanon, Europe and North
America.
	   The meeting will be chaired by Khaled al-Fahoum, a former
chairman of the Palestine National Council, said Ali Badwan, the
spokesman of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine.
	   The hard-liners are urging a boycott of the Dec. 14 meeting of
the Palestinian National Council in Gaza City, where mainstream
Palestinians are expected to nullify those parts of the Palestinian
National Charter that call for Israel's destruction.
	   The hard-liners in Damascus will ``map out a plan for continued
struggle against the Israeli occupation (of Palestinian lands) and
the rejection of any peace agreement with the Zionists,'' Gharbiyeh
said. He did not elaborate.
	   Badwan told The Associated Press in Damascus that Palestinian
leader Arafat should not amend the charter while Israel is building
settlements on Palestinian.
	   The amendment is required by the Israeli-Palestinian peace
accords of Oslo and Wye River, which was signed by Arafat and
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   These agreements call upon the Palestinians to purge their
charter of words that deny Israel's right to exist.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton is scheduled to attend the Gaza
assembly in a sign of America's commitment to the peace process.
	   Among the participants at the Damascus meeting are leaders who
figure high on Israel's list of persons wanted for violence.
	   They include Ahmed Jibril of the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine-General Command, George Habash of the
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, Nayef Hawatmeh of
the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, and Ramadan
Abdullah Shallah of Islamic Jihad.
	   Among the other militant groups expected at the conference are
Fateh Uprising and Hamas, which has carried out a series of suicide
bombings in Israel.

NBA cancels All-Star game
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with Philadelphia mayor saying
All-Star game is canceled. &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ In yet another sign that the American pro season
may never begin, the National Basketball Asscoation on Tuesday
canceled its annual exhibition All-Star game.
	   Philadelphia Mayor Edward Rendell said that commissioner David
Stern telephoned him with the news and was to make the announcement
later Tuesday at a news conference in New York. The game had been
scheduled for Feb. 14 in Philadelphia.
	   ``That's the only landmark left,'' NBA deputy commissioner Russ
Granik told USA Today. ``I hope the players haven't been convinced
that the owners would never cancel the whole season.''
	   The league was negotiating with Philadelphia, through the
mayor's office, to find ways of softening the impact on hotels,
which reserved large blocks of rooms for the weekend, The
Philadelphia Inquirer reported.
	   The league booked dlrs 3 million worth of rooms. The hotels
could have earned that much in food and beverage sales.
	   Meanwhile, agents David Falk and Arn Tellem announced Monday
that an exhibition game involving locked out NBA players is set for
Dec. 19 in Atlantic City, New Jersey, with the proceeds going to
charity and to players in financial need.
	   But Falk's most famous client, Michael Jordan, won't be playing.
	   ``Michael has said he won't make a decision about returning to
professional basketball or retiring until the lockout is over,''
said Curtis Polk, president of Falk's sports management company.
	   ``We did talk to Michael about the game, obviously, and Michael
feels he needs to stand by his earlier statement that he'll wait
for a resolution of the lockout before he makes that decision. He
wouldn't want to send the fans a sort of mixed message by his
participation in this game.''
	   Jordan's absence didn't stop the Atlantic City organizers from
pricing their game extravagantly. Tickets will cost from dlrs 25 to
dlrs 1,000 for courtside seats, and organizers hope to raise at
least dlrs 1 million.
	   None of the players will be paid, and no criteria have been
established for determining which players will share in the
proceeds.
	   ``If you look at people who play professional sports, not a lot
of them are financially secure,'' union president Patrick Ewing
said. ``They make a lot of money, and they also spend a lot of
money.
	   ``Me, I'm financially secure, but there a lot of others who
aren't. Our objective is to help these people. No matter how much
money they've made throughout their careers, if they're in need
now, then it's up to us to try and help them,'' Ewing said.
	   Thirteen players are committed to play, and organizers hope to
have a total of 16 players who were members of the four Dream teams
_ the 1992 and 1996 Olympic teams and the 1994 and 1998 World
Championship teams.
	   Ewing, Karl Malone, Penny Hardaway, Tim Hardaway, Allan Houston,
Reggie Miller, Alonzo Mourning, Tom Gugliotta, Gary Payton,
Dominique Wilkins, Vin Baker, Glen Rice and Mitch Richmond have
committed.

Light Blues tie record with 16-12 win
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TWICKENHAM, England (AP) _ Cambridge University won the Bowring
Bowl for a record-tying fifth time in a row on Tuesday by beating
favored Oxford 16-12 in the annual Varsity match at Twickenham.
	   Fielding four New Zealanders and three Australians, including
brothers Hamish and Angus Innes at lock forward, the Light Blues of
Cambridge tied the record they set twice between 1972-76 and
1980-84 to maintain their domination over the Dark Blues of Oxford.
	   Cambridge now has 56 wins to Oxford's 48, with 13 matches tied,
in a confrontation first played in 1872.
	   Oxford's 15 included center Kurt Shuman, who has won 10
international caps for the United States, five Australians and a
South African. Oxford had been expected to end the Cambridge streak
before 60,000 fans at the home of English rugby union.
	   The Dark Blues went ahead with a try by winger Nick Booth but
Cambridge hit back with Mark Denny's score and the two teams went
into half time tied at 5-5.
	   Cambridge hooker Stefan Rodgers, whose father coaches the team,
went over for a try five minutes into the second half and two
penalties from New Zealand fly half Paul Moran opened up a 16-5
lead for the Light Blues.
	   In a late rally, Oxford winger Nick Humphries scored a try which
Booth converted to cut the lead to four points but the Cambridge
pack kept Oxford pinned back to prevent another score.

At least 18 killed in fighting in Baidoa
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) _ At least 18 people were killed and
another 30 wounded in clashes between two rival clans in a busy
marketplace in the central Somali town of Baidoa, witnesses said
Tuesday.
	   Witnesses in the town, contacted by VHF radio, said fighting
broke out Monday between the Rahanwein Resistance Army and forces
loyal to faction leader Hussein Aidid for control of Baidoa, 150
kilometers (95 miles) northwest of the capital Mogadishu.
	   Most of the dead and wounded were civilians, the reports said.
	   Mohamed Ali Aden Qaline, a spokesman for the RRA in the
Mogadishu, told reporters his forces launched the attack to capture
the town from Aidid's militiamen.
	   He said RRA fighters killed 10 of Aidid's men and destroyed five
of their machine gun-mounted battle trucks. Three of his own
fighters were killed, six more were wounded, and one RRA
gun-mounted vehicle was lost, he said.
	   A militiaman loyal to Aidid, a powerful faction leader who
recently joined forces with another former rival to set up a
municipal administration in the formerly divided Mogadishu, said
six of Aidid's men were killed in the Baidoa fighting and 14 were
wounded.
	   He said his faction captured two armed vehicles and forced the
RRA to retreat.
	   Aidid late Monday sent more than 100 heavily armed men in 15
battle trucks to reinforce his fighters in Baidoa.
	   The town was quiet Tuesday under Aidid's control, the witnesses
said.

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Friends who called on Dariush Foruhar and
his wife one afternoon in late November grew worried when no one
answered the doorbell for hours. Since the husband and wife had the
flu, it was odd for them to be out for so long.
	   Then a close friend climbed over the iron gate of the house to
see if all was well. He came out running, his face ashen. The
couple, longtime critics of the Iranian government, had been slain.
	   Foruhar had been stabbed some 15 times in the heart with a
knife. His blood-soaked body was slumped behind a desk. His wife,
Parvaneh, also stabbed to death, was dressed as if she was just
about to go out or had just come home.
	   There was no sign of burglary. It seemed like a professional
killing. Both husband and wife had been sprayed with some unknown
substance, knocking them out so they couldn't scream for help.
	   The slayings were chilling in their familiarity: Nine political
activists whose actions angered Iran's clerical rulers have been
killed over the past decade, at least half stabbed to death like
the Foruhars.
	   They include a Tehran University professor, a magazine editor, a
publisher, three Christian priests and two Sunni Muslim preachers
who spoke out against Iran's Shiite Muslim leaders.
	   The day the Foruhars were buried marked the 10th anniversary of
another killing. Kazem Sami, leader of a liberal Islamic movement
opposed to the mullahs, was stabbed to death at his Tehran office
on Nov. 26, 1988.
	   In none of the earlier slayings are the perpetrators known to
have been found or brought to justice.
	   Police said they have made several arrests in the slaying of the
Foruhars, after President Mohammad Khatami condemned the killings
and ordered an investigation. So far, the findings have not been
made public.
	   Dissidents and newspapers are beginning to question the spate of
slayings, emboldened by the promise of political freedoms offered
by Khatami, a moderate cleric elected last year.
	   The National Front, an umbrella group that included Foruhar's
Iran Nation Party, noted that the couple's every movement was
closely watched by the intelligence and security agencies.
	   ``Everyone is asking, `How could one or more persons have gone
through this permanent intelligence watch and murdered the Foruhars
in cold blood,''' the group said in a statement.
	   New York-based Human Rights Watch expressed concern ``that the
killing of the Foruhars is part of a longstanding pattern of
harassment and persecution of government critics in Iran.''
	   Parvaneh Foruhar had told Human Rights Watch that she and her
husband feared for their lives. At the end of every day, she said,
they thanked God for granting them another day to live.
	   The political killings have not been limited by Iran's borders.
More than 60 Iranian exiles have been slain abroad since 1979, but
few countries have tried to trace the source of the killings for
fear of upsetting relations with Iran.
	   But last year, when a German court convicted an Iranian secret
agent and three other men of murdering a dissident in 1992, it said
the men carried out the assassinations on the orders of Iran's top
leaders, a declaration that soured German-Iranian relations.
	   When Khatami was elected, the majority of Iranians hoped he
would bring genuine change, ending the heavy-handed rule of the
last 20 years.
	   But Khatami's efforts have been frustrated by powerful
hard-liners like Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. As supreme leader, he has
the last word on all matters.
	   More and more, Khatami's hard-line rivals are using violence to
deal with opponents. Over the past year, vigilantes have attacked
dissidents, liberal newspapers and even a reformist Cabinet
minister. They have also broken up pro-democracy rallies.
	   None of the thugs has been arrested, leading to suspicions that
they are backed by powerful hard-line clerics like Khamenei and
Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi, the head of the judiciary.
	   Despite Khatami's promises, prominent dissidents continue to be
subjected to arbitrary detention and restrictions on their freedom
of expression.
	   On Monday, the Zan newspaper reported that poet and writer
Mohammed Mokhtari left his Tehran house the previous Thursday and
disappeared. His family searched morgues, hospitals and police
stations but found no sign of him. The Iranian Writers Association
has appealed to authorities to investigate.
	   In November, four journalists from the daily Tous, a daily that
was ordered to close in recent months along with a handful of
others for its outspoken views, were freed after a month in jail.
	   In July, during the corruption scandal surrounding Tehran Mayor
Gholamhossein Karbaschi _ a close ally of Khatami _ officials
arrested along with the mayor claimed they were held and tortured
in secret prisons run by the Intelligence Ministry.
	   Moderates have said that the arrest of Karbaschi, who is
appealing his corruption conviction, was meant to undermine
Khatami. Newspapers reported that the mayor's aides told of their
torture before a parliamentary committee.
	   In September former deputy prime minister, Abbas Amir-Entezam,
was detained following his public criticism of the treatment of
political prisoners. Amir-Entezam had been freed in 1996 after 17
years in prison on charges of spying for the United States.
	   A year ago, thugs attacked the home of Grand Ayatollah Hossein
Ali Montazeri, a senior cleric, after he publicly questioned the
rule of the clerics.
	   Montazeri, 75, was once heir apparent to the late Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini, Iran's spiritual guide, but fell from grace for
criticizing human rights abuses. He has been under house arrest
since 1989.
	   Still, Ayatollah Yazdi _ the judiciary chief who operates beyond
Khatami's control _ insists there are no political prisoners in the
Islamic Republic.

Officials: Heads of four kidnapped foreigners found

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ Chechen authorities found the decapitated
heads of four kidnapped foreigners Tuesday along a highway near a
remote village after a two-month search in the breakaway region in
southern Russia.
	   An Associated Press reporter saw the severed heads near the
village of Assinovskaya, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) west of
Grozny, the Chechen capital. He did not see any sign of the bodies.
The heads were lined up on a piece of cloth along a main highway
across southern Russia, NTV television reported.
	   The heads were identified as those of the four abducted
foreigners by Umar Makhauri, who had been a bodyguard assigned to
the four when they were abducted Oct. 3 by unidentified gunmen in
Grozny. He said the bodies had not been found.
	   But Chechen government officials at the scene said four bodies
had been found without giving further details. Chechen President
Aslan Maskhadov said in Grozny that the bodies of four men had been
recovered.
	   The hostages _ Britons Peter Kennedy, Darren Hickey, and Rudolf
Petschi, and New Zealand's Stanley Shaw _ were engineers. They were
working for Granger Telecom, a British telephone company,
installing 300,000 telephone lines across Chechnya.
	   Maskhadov said Chechen officials had caught one of the captors
Monday and he told police where the hostages were being held. But
that information reached the other captors, who decided to kill
their captives, the ITAR-Tass news agency quoted Maskhadov as
saying.
	   The chief executive of Granger Telecom, Ray Verth, said Tuesday
that Chechen authorities had mounted a rescue attempt Monday night
that went ``tragically wrong.'' No other details were available.
	   He said the company had ``opened a dialogue with the kidnappers
and received confirmation that the hostages were alive as recently
as last week.''
	   ``Their murder is an appalling and barbaric act and our thoughts
go out to the families to whom we offer our deepest condolences. We
are a small tightly-knit company and everyone here is in a state of
shock,'' Verth said outside company headquarters in Weybridge,
south of London, where flags were flying at half-mast.
	   Spokesmen at the British and New Zealand embassies in Moscow
said they were checking on reports the four men had been killed,
but could not comment. The British Foreign Ministry in London said
it was investigating urgently reports that bodies had been found.
	   Chechen acting First Vice Premier Turpal Atgeriyev, who is
heading the investigation into the killings, said authorities had
several suspects in the abduction, but have failed to make any
progress, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Eamon Hickey, the father of one of the missing men, said he
heard the news and was hoping it would not be confirmed.
	   ``There is so much rumor and counter-rumor coming from out there
that we don't know what to think. Obviously we are hoping and
praying that it does not turn out to be true,'' he said at his home
in England.
	   Chechen authorities had been searching for the missing men for
the past two months. British officials said they had not received
any ransom demand for the missing men.
	   Maskhadov said the deaths of the four men were a major blow to
Chechnya and its efforts to gain international recognition of its
independence. He blamed the rash of abductions in Chechnya to
unidentified ``outside forces'' and their Chechen henchmen.
	   ``I am ready to answer before my people and the whole world for
what happened,'' he was quoted as saying by the Interfax news
agency.
	   Hostage-takings, usually for ransom, have become common in
Chechnya since the end of the breakaway republic's two-year war for
independence from Russia in 1996. But victims are rarely killed.
	   Since the beginning of 1998, 176 people have been kidnapped in
the North Caucasus region of Russia, including dozens of
foreigners, and 90 of them released, officials have said.

British Museum to Celebrate Discovery of Rosetta Stone
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The discovery of the Rosetta Stone, which gave the
clue to deciphering ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics, will be
celebrated with a six-month exhibition next year, the British
Museum said Tuesday.
	   The slab of black granite, found by French troops near Rosetta
on the banks of the Nile in 1799, is the museum's most popular
treasure and always attracts crowds, said director Robert Anderson.
	   The stone is inscribed with a royal decree of Ptolemy V in 196
B.C. in three scripts: hieroglyphic, a popular written form of
ancient Egyptian and ancient Greek.
	   British troops at war with Napoleon Bonaparte seized the stone
from the French and it entered the museum in 1802. Twenty years
later it was deciphered by the French archaeologist Francois
Champollion.
	   The exhibition, ``Cracking Codes: The Rosetta Stone and
Decipherment,'' opens in June 1999.
	   It will illustrate the role and effects of writing in a single
culture which lasted for 3,000 years, hieroglyphs and scripts in
other countries and current work on decipherment.

	   ROME (AP) _ Designer Valentino and thousands of strollers joined
Pope John Paul II Tuesday in a traditional pre-Christmas
appointment near the Spanish Steps.
	   Romans, Rome's mayor and tourists marking Italy's national
holiday honoring Mary on the Feast of the Immaculate Conception
crowded around a column in the middle of the square. The pope
brought a basket of pink roses to join the other flowers placed
earlier in the day around the column.
	   John Paul, 78, seemed in form on the chilly but crisp day. In
last year's ceremony, the pope, whose hip surgery a few years ago
makes it often hard for him to bend, didn't kneel, but this year he
did.
	   After the ceremony the pope greeted Valentino, whose boutique
and headquarters are just off the square. The designer pointed out
the Valentino Christmas tree nearby, where coins placed into a box
to turn on the tree lights are donated to help children with AIDS.
	   ```Bravo,''' the designer said the pope told him.
	   The narrow streets, lined with designer boutiques, which lead to
the Spanish Steps, were packed with tens of thousands of strollers
hoping to get a glimpse of the pope.
	   One of them, Maria Preti, 71, said she has been coming since she
was a child to the Dec. 8 ceremony. For Romans like her, the annual
appointment ``is the beginning of the Christmas season.''
	   The feast day, a national holiday in several other European
countries, marks the Catholic teaching that Mary was conceived
without original sin.

Ukraine's foreign minister to visit China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's Foreign Minister Borys Tarasyuk
will pay an official visit to China on Dec. 10-15 to discuss the
broadening of bilateral economic ties, the ministry said Tuesday.
	   Tarasyuk will meet with his Chinese counterpart Tang Jiaxuan and
other senior Chinese officials.
	   Tarasyuk plans to offer new cooperation projects, such as
supplying turbines produced by Ukraine's Turboatom plant and other
energy equipment, the ministry said.
	   A delegation of Ukrainian businessmen would accompany Tarasyuk.
China is the former Soviet nation's largest trade partner, after
Russia.
	   The sides also plan to discuss political developments in Europe
and the former Soviet Union and Ukraine's stance on its ties with
NATO, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Tarasyuk is expected to reiterate Ukraine's adherence to the
principle of ``one China,'' which recognizes Taiwan as a province
of China.
	   In 1996, Taiwanese Premier Lien Chan unexpectedly visited
Ukraine, drawing protests from China. Beijing claims the island as
a rebel province and demands eventual reunification.

Disgraced directors reinstated on Newcastle board
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes, reaction

<TEXT>
	   NEWCASTLE, England (AP) _ They're back.
	   Freddy Shepherd and Douglas Hall were reappointed to Newcastle's
controlling board Tuesday _ seven months after resigning in
disgrace for insulting the club's fans, the city's women and star
striker Alan Shearer.
	   Shepherd and Hall won back their places on the Newcastle plc
board at the end of the company's stormy annual general meeting.
	   The company chairman, Denis Cassidy, and non-executive directors
Tom Fenton and John Josephs resigned in protest at the return of
Shepherd and Hall.
	   Newcastle's stockbrokers, BT Alex Brown, also quit.
	   The company said chief executive Freddie Fletcher will take over
as acting chairman until the position is filled permanently, and
another independent director will also be appointed.
	   Hall and Shepherd left both the soccer board and company board
last season after being caught on film mocking Newcastle fans for
paying high prices for club merchandise, describing Newcastle women
as ``dogs'' and calling Shearer ``Mary Poppins.''
	   The pair returned to their positions as chairman and deputy
chairman of the soccer board in July. But their return to the main
company board was not foreseen.
	   But with a shareholding in excess of 60 percent between their
companies, Shepherd and Hall were able to force their way back onto
the board.
	   ``The 65 percent shareholders said they wanted to come back to
the main Plc Board,'' Fletcher said. ``There was a view that you
are better inviting them back and working with them to develop a
long-term strategy and there was another view that they shouldn't
come back.''
	   Fletcher said the return of the pair would result in no change
on the soccer front.
	   ``The football club hasn't changed, all that's altered is the
Plc board,'' he said. ``The football club will still be given the
greatest priority, which means being successful on the park.''
	   Newcastle shares on the London stock market fell by more than 3
percent at the news of the two directors' return.
	   Fletcher dismissed speculation that the club would have to be
taken off the stock market and into the private hands of Hall and
Shepherd. He also denied reports of possible takeover bids from
U.S. media giant Time Warner and Japanese electronics firm Sony.
	   ``We are not in any talks about a takeover,'' Fletcher said.
``If you enter any talks, then you have to inform the Stock
Exchange. We have not been involved in any talks, and if we were,
it wouldn't be a secret.''
	   The move to welcome back Shepherd and Hall was met with caution
by members of the Independent Newcastle United Supporters'
Association.
	   ``I don't think anything that's happened today will impress
anybody,'' chairman Kevin Miles said. ``I think most fans are more
concerned about (Duncan) Ferguson and Shearer than Hall and
Shepherd.''

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ It's a bad time for soccer in Greece.
	   ``Our country is being internationally defamed at the time it is
preparing to organize the Olympic Games,'' said a recent report
issued by a parliamentary committee on soccer.
	   But most Greeks don't need a document to tell them something is
rotten with their country's most popular sport.
	   All they have to do is follow the 18-team first division league,
where the coverage lately is as much about clashes as goals.
	   The latest wave of vandalism and violence began with allegations
of biased referees. The suspicions are fed by fans and team owners
and probed by sports newspapers, which have reported accusations
that some referees have been bribed.
	   ``Something stinks and the politicians have an obligation to do
something about it,'' Panathinaikos club president Giorgos
Vardinoyiannis was quoted as saying in newspapers Tuesday.
	   Now, every questionable call or close game is scrutinized with
the loser blaming it on corruption. This growing belief in
conspiracies and game fixing has stoked tempers to unprecedented
levels.
	   During Sunday's first-division match between Olympiakos and
longtime rival Panathinaikos, fans burned cars, threw stones at
police, attacked bystanders and tore seats from the stadium that
will host the 2004 Olympic Games. Olympiakos won 4-2.
	   One year ago, both teams were ordered to pay more than dlrs 1
million in fines after their fans tried to set the Olympic stadium
on fire during another derby.
	   The Athens daily Ta Nea declared that sportsmanship ``has been
buried.'' But the game is ``like a vampire (and) insists on walking
around.''
	   Worries about mayhem have been hurting attendance steadily. Only
30,000 die-hard fans or members of organized clubs went to the
80,000-seat Olympic stadium on Saturday.
	   Police also are tired. For months, their unions have been
agitating to be relieved of security and riot control duty at
stadiums. They argue that clubs _ which are privately owned
corporations _ receive dlrs millions in subsidies from state soccer
gambling pools and should pay for their own security.
	   A law passed 12 years ago barring rowdy fans from stadiums never
has been implemented fully.
	   According to the parliamentary report, the core problem is that
``there is a general lack of credibility that creates a climate of
doubt and suspicion'' that results in violence.
	   Last year, nearly half the country's 300 lawmakers issued a
statement complaining that soccer ``is being led to decline and
extermination.''
	   But instead of working to calm fears, some government officials
only reinforce that belief of behind-the-scene meddling in the
sport.
	   When PAOK supporters took to the streets to protest a league
decision that penalized their team for a riot and the beating of a
referee by the club's fans, they found a supporter in Defense
Minister Akis Tsochadzopoulos.
	   ``Look there is a great outcry in Salonica, and I think it's
justified,'' Tsochadzopoulos said of his home town. ``Once more it
was proven that the well-known 'godfathers' of soccer struck.''
	   But Tsochadzopoulos refused to name the alleged culprits _
bolstering the idea among some fans, and club owners, that the fix
is in.
	   Some irate PAOK fans even saw a broader conspiracy. On Sunday,
they burned more than 1,000 cable decoders because the pay-TV
station that broadcasts league games only showed nine minutes of
the PAOK match.
	   Whatever the causes, the results have driven away many Greeks
from what was once a national pastime. Some commentators say that
may not be a bad idea.
	   ``Maybe we should just take the decision that the sickness of
which we all speak is incurable, that's it and whoever likes it,''
wrote columnist Errikos Bartzinopoulos in the Athens daily Ethnos.

Books overtake bullets as Kosovo Albanian schools reopen _ warily

<TEXT>
	   BLACE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Teachers dart uneasy glances out
windows of the bullet-pocked school, scanning the road for the
feared police. Camouflage-clad rebels hunch behind nearby bushes.
Schoolbooks have been destroyed.
	   Tense Kosovo, where a precarious truce feels like intermission
in a horror movie, is hardly a suitable environment for education.
	   But numerous villages are marking small triumphs across the
devastated province, reopening war-damaged schools as they move to
restore some normalcy to shattered lives.
	   ``It's the first good event in our lives in several months,''
says Avni Hoxha, a 33-year-old ethnic Albanian arriving to pick up
his two children from the battered school building where classes
resumed in the southwestern Kosovo village of Blace last week.
``Children must go to school. They need an education.''
	   The ethnic Albanians say 56 schools were ruined, many others
damaged and still others abandoned in the panic to flee Serbian
forces during this year's punishing campaign against Kosovo
Albanian separatists.
	   Serb children, too, have suffered from safety fears and
relocation during the conflict in the Serbian province, where
ethnic Albanians outnumber them by roughly 10 to 1. But the
overwhelming majority of the hundreds of people killed, and schools
wrecked, were ethnic Albanian.
	   As tens of thousands of refugees cautiously return home in the
wake of an October peace agreement, getting schools back in
operation has become a top priority. Decani, Rastane and Blace are
among those that have reopened theirs in the past few days, with
safety assurances from international peace verifiers.
	   ``It's a heartening thing,'' said American Brett Mattei,
standing alongside one of the monitors' Day-Glo orange Humvees
after consulting with local leaders on reopening a school in
central Kosovo. ``It shows villagers are feeling more confident,
more secure.''
	   Blace (pronounced BLAHT-say), located just off the
Pristina-Prizren highway that police and rebels battled over so
fiercely, stood empty for four months until residents who had fled
to forests or other homes began trickling back in late October.
	   More than 100 houses were deemed wrecked beyond repair. Hasty
repairs were made to get the school up and running despite a
bashed-in roof and no electricity in the village of 6,000.
	   Rain leaks into unusable classrooms, loose wires hang down, and
wooden beams and tree limbs are used to prop up the jerry-rigged
roof. With only four rooms in use, the 600 children attend class in
three shifts, from 7:30 a.m. to 6:30 a.m.
	   Emotional scars reflect those left by machine-gun bullets on the
faded green outer walls.
	   In Shqipe Bllaca's second-grade class, where war trauma is
etched in the children's drawn faces, pupils and teacher shared
painful war experiences on the first day back in school. One girl
wept as she talked about all the burned houses, Bllaca recalled.
Others have 15 or 20 people living in their homes.
	   Eight-year-old Albina Kroni, gazing with big brown eyes,
struggles for words when asked to recount her family's situation
for visitors.
	   ``I was three months out of my home and my village, and I moved
to three other villages,'' she says solemnly. ``I missed my home.''
	   The village already was poor before the conflict began. The
schoolroom walls are bare and dirty, and there are no books.
	   The children's homework assignment won't be easy: Find a
notebook and a pen.
	   Teachers haven't been paid their monthly salary of 100 German
marks (dlrs 60) in five months. Two are in jail, suspected by Serb
police of ties to the Kosovo Liberation Army. And there's only
enough wood on hand to keep the school stoves burning for two
weeks.
	   But Bllaca, who wears a parka to ward off the classroom chill,
says the children and teachers are still glad to be back.
	   ``I don't worry about our difficult conditions in school,'' the
32-year-old teacher says. ``I worry about our difficult conditions
in general.''
	   ``I worry about peace for our children.''
	   There's no sense that peace is at hand just yet.
	   On the school playground, boys sing songs about the KLA and play
war games. They dream of becoming rebel fighters, and sometimes
flash victory signs as armored Serb police cars rumble past on
patrol.
	   For now, parents and teachers take satisfaction in the
achievement of having started classes again. They know there's no
way to keep the war atmosphere outside school walls.
	   ``It's our reality,'' says Muhamet Bajraktari, the school's
principal. ``They can't escape it.''

At least 18 killed, 30 wounded in clan fighting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) _ At least 18 people were killed and 30
were wounded in clashes between two rival clans in a busy
marketplace in the central Somali town of Baidoa, witnesses said
Tuesday.
	   Most of the dead and wounded were civilians, the reports said.
	   Witnesses in the town, contacted by radio, said fighting broke
out Monday between the Rahanwein Resistance Army and forces loyal
to faction leader Hussein Aidid for control of Baidoa, 95 miles
(150 kilometers) northwest of the capital Mogadishu.
	   Mohamed Ali Aden Qaline, a spokesman for the RRA in the
Mogadishu, told reporters his forces launched the attack to capture
the town from Aidid's militiamen.
	   He said RRA fighters killed 10 of Aidid's men and destroyed five
of their machine gun-mounted battle trucks. Three of his own
fighters were killed, six were wounded, and one RRA gun-mounted
vehicle was lost, he said.
	   A militiaman loyal to Aidid, a powerful faction leader who
recently joined forces with another former rival to set up a
municipal administration in the formerly divided Mogadishu, said
six of Aidid's men were killed in the Baidoa fighting and 14 were
wounded.
	   He said his faction captured two armed vehicles and forced the
RRA to retreat.
	   The town was quiet Tuesday under Aidid's control, the witnesses
said.

National Front member calls for Le Pen-Megret rapprochement

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Mainstream right-wing parties, who for years have
lost ground to the National Front, were rejoicing on Tuesday at the
take-no-prisoners battle shaping up within the extreme-right party.
	   A day after leader Jean-Marie Le Pen dismissed several party
functionaries who'd spoken out against him _ ``purges,'' many
called it _ there was speculation the party could finally split
over the bitter struggle between Le Pen and his longtime top
lieutenant, Bruno Megret.
	   The two men scheduled dueling news conferences for later this
week, fueling predictions of a full schism.
	   ``A war without mercy,'' headlined the daily Le Monde.
	   Naturally, parties on the mainstream right were pleased.
	   Gilles de Robien, a member of the conservative Union for French
Democracy, applauded what he called ``the weakening of an extremist
party that has no business in a democracy.''
	   ``What is happening at the National Front is the destiny of all
authoritarian parties,'' said de Robien.
	   Another leading conservative, Nicolas Sarkozy of President
Jacques Chirac's Rally for the Republic party, said the troubles
were ``a payback for the opposition, which is doing its work.''
	   ``When the right is on a comeback, the extreme right weakens,''
he said.
	   The conservative former defense minister Charles Millon, a
political black sheep since accepting National Front votes last
spring in a regional election, said he'd welcome the far-right
party's members in the new party he has created, called The Right.
	   That didn't sit well with the Socialist majority. Jean-Marc
Ayrault, the party's president in the National Assembly, warned
that National Front ideas, like a ``little bird, could settle in
the nests of other parties.''
	   The virulently anti-immigrant National front has been widely
accused of racism and anti-Semitism.
	   Le Pen, 70, has been its absolute leader for a quarter-century.
But his increasingly public struggle with the quieter and pragmatic
_ though no less ideological _ Megret has weakened his hand.
	   Megret, for his part, has not commented, except for calling a
news conference on Wednesday _ two days before Le Pen holds his
own.
	   But Megret supporters called on Tuesday for a congress of the
far-right party in order to iron out the differences.
	   ``Party members ... want to be heard and they very much want to
see a Le Pen-Megret ticket,'' said one of them, Jean-Yves Le
Gallou.
	   But that seemed virtually impossible.
	   A top Le Pen deputy, who is also his son-in-law, called the
appeal for a congress ``a maneuver to destabilize the National
Front.''
	   ``It is clear that some people are playing with fire,'' said
Samuel Marechal.
	   The long-simmering tensions between Le Pen and Megret burst onto
the surface this weekend, at a noisy party gathering where Le Pen
ejected two Megret supporters who'd been dismissed from their
functions a few days earlier _ ostensibly for economic reasons.
	   On Monday, a former Le Pen loyalist, Serge Martinez, openly
defied him and was immediately fired, along with three others the
same day.

Hoechst board approves restructuring, merger with Rhone-Poulenc
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ The board of Germany's Hoechst AG on
Tuesday approved the company's merger with France's Rhone-Poulenc,
a move that will create one of the world's biggest pharmaceutical
companies.
	   Hoechst's board also gave its blessing to the planned
restructuring of the company. Hoechst will split off its chemical
sector to merge its life sciences operations with the French
company.
	   The new life sciences company, to be called Aventis, will have
annual sales of around dlrs 20 billion, spanning pharmaceuticals,
agricultural and animal health products.
	   Hoechst also announced it was selling a subsidiary, Dublin-based
Hostaglas, to the German Hagedorn group. It did not disclose the
sale price. The purchase was made retroactive to Dec. 1.
	   Unions in France and Germany have been critical of the merger so
far, fearing that cost cutting will lead to layoffs. Hoechst
employs 118,000 workers and Rhone-Poulenc employs 68,000.

Polgar, Karpov match in question, Polgar vs Kasparov likely
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ The Las Vegas ``battle of the sexes''
match between chess champions Anatoly Karpov and Zsuzsa Polgar is
off for now for lack of funds, the state-run news agency MTI
reported Tuesday.
	   ``Until the prize money has been placed with a lawyer, there is
no sense discussing a match,'' Laszlo Polgar, the father-manager of
the three Polgar grandmasters, said.
	   There had been reports of a dlrs 300,000 tournament in Las Vegas
this month.
	   Karpov, 47, is the reigning champion of the World Chess
Federation, known by its French acronym FIDE. Susan Polgar, 29, is
the reigning world women's champion.
	   She became a grandmaster in 1991 and once beat Karpov, the
world's fifth-ranked player.
	   Her sister, Judit, 21, the world's top female chess player,
defeated Karpov in June in Budapest.
	   Laszlo Polgar said Judit will likely play against Garry Kasparov
next year, but did not specify any details.
	   The third Polgar daughter, Zsofia, is also among the world's top
20 chess players.

Brazilian police: Documents on purported presidential corruption
</HEADLINE>
are fake &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: Company name is spelled with ampersand. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Brazilian police investigators
concluded that documents purportedly showing that President
Fernando Henrique Cardoso and three close allies stashed away
millions of dollars in an overseas account are fake, a newspaper
reported on Tuesday.
	   Last month, the so-called ``Cayman Dossier,'' which was leaked
to the press, said that Cardoso _ along with Sao Paulo Gov. Mario
Covas, Health Minister Jose Serra and ex-Communications Minister
Sergio Motta, who died early this year _ held dlrs 368 million in a
Cayman Islands corporate account. The account was supposedly opened
in a company named CH, J and T.
	   The Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper said investigators who went to
the Cayman Islands compared CH, J and T documents with those
contained in the dossier and concluded the papers were phony.
	   The newspaper, said the contents of the dossier were made by
superimposing documents mentioning the account over official CH, J
and T stationery.
	   Investigators will now concentrate their efforts in trying to
discover who preapared and leaked the dossier to the press.
	   The federal police was not immediately available to comment on
the Folha de Sao Paulo's report.

Officials: Heads of four kidnapped foreigners found
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in top 2 grafs with heads lined up along highway. &QL; 
 &UR; By RUSLAN MUSAYEV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ Chechen authorities found the decapitated
heads of four kidnapped foreigners Tuesday along a highway near a
remote village after a two-month search in the breakaway region in
southern Russia.
	   An Associated Press reporter saw the severed heads near the
village of Assinovskaya, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) west of
Grozny, the Chechen capital. He did not see any sign of the bodies.
The heads were lined up on a piece of cloth along a main highway
across southern Russia, NTV television reported.
	   The heads were identified as those of the four abducted
foreigners by Umar Makhauri, who had been a bodyguard assigned to
the four when they were abducted Oct. 3 by unidentified gunmen in
Grozny. He said the bodies had not been found.
	   But Chechen government officials at the scene said four bodies
had been found without giving further details. Chechen President
Aslan Maskhadov said in Grozny that the bodies of four men had been
recovered.
	   The hostages _ Britons Peter Kennedy, Darren Hickey, and Rudolf
Petschi, and New Zealand's Stanley Shaw _ were engineers. They were
working for Granger Telecom, a British telephone company,
installing 300,000 telephone lines across Chechnya.
	   Maskhadov said Chechen officials had caught one of the captors
Monday and he told police where the hostages were being held. But
that information reached the other captors, who decided to kill
their captives, the ITAR-Tass news agency quoted Maskhadov as
saying.
	   The chief executive of Granger Telecom, Ray Verth, said Tuesday
that Chechen authorities had mounted a rescue attempt Monday night
that went ``tragically wrong.'' No other details were available.
	   He said the company had ``opened a dialogue with the kidnappers
and received confirmation that the hostages were alive as recently
as last week.''
	   ``Their murder is an appalling and barbaric act and our thoughts
go out to the families to whom we offer our deepest condolences. We
are a small tightly-knit company and everyone here is in a state of
shock,'' Verth said outside company headquarters in Weybridge,
south of London, where flags were flying at half-mast.
	   Spokesmen at the British and New Zealand embassies in Moscow
said they were checking on reports the four men had been killed,
but could not comment. The British Foreign Ministry in London said
it was investigating urgently reports that bodies had been found.
	   Chechen acting First Vice Premier Turpal Atgeriyev, who is
heading the investigation into the killings, said authorities had
several suspects in the abduction, but have failed to make any
progress, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Eamon Hickey, the father of one of the missing men, said he
heard the news and was hoping it would not be confirmed.
	   ``There is so much rumor and counter-rumor coming from out there
that we don't know what to think. Obviously we are hoping and
praying that it does not turn out to be true,'' he said at his home
in England.
	   Chechen authorities had been searching for the missing men for
the past two months. British officials said they had not received
any ransom demand for the missing men.
	   Maskhadov said the deaths of the four men were a major blow to
Chechnya and its efforts to gain international recognition of its
independence. He blamed the rash of abductions in Chechnya to
unidentified ``outside forces'' and their Chechen henchmen.
	   ``I am ready to answer before my people and the whole world for
what happened,'' he was quoted as saying by the Interfax news
agency.
	   Hostage-takings, usually for ransom, have become common in
Chechnya since the end of the breakaway republic's two-year war for
independence from Russia in 1996. But victims are rarely killed.
	   Since the beginning of 1998, 176 people have been kidnapped in
the North Caucasus region of Russia, including dozens of
foreigners, and 90 of them released, officials have said.

	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ Chechen authorities today found the
severed heads of four kidnapped foreigners near a remote village
after a two-month search in the breakaway region in southern
Russia.
	   An Associated Press reporter saw the four heads near the village
of Assinovskaya, about 25 miles west of Grozny, the Chechen
capital. He did not see any other remains.
	   The heads were identified as those of the four foreigners by
their former bodyguard, Umar Makhauri. Makhauri was assigned to the
three Britons and one New Zealander at the time they were abducted
Oct. 3 by unidentified gunmen in Grozny. He said the rest of their
bodies had not been found.
	   However, Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov said in Grozny that
the bodies of the four men had been recovered.
	   The hostages _ Britons Peter Kennedy, Darren Hickey, and Rudolf
Petschi, and New Zealander Stanley Shaw _ were engineers working
for Granger Telecom, a British telephone company, installing
300,000 telephone lines across Chechnya.
	   Maskhadov said Chechen officials caught one of the captors

<TEXT>
	   BOSTON (AP) _ A Russian geneticist claims he has found an
extensive DNA match between American Indians and a nomadic people
living in a region north of Mongolia, according to a published
report.
	   Ilya Zakharov, deputy director of Moscow's Vavilov Institute of
General Genetics, told the Christian Science Monitor's Moscow
bureau that his genetic studies of the Tuvan people in Siberia have
significantly narrowed the search for the exact origin of American
Indians.
	   ``This is a big breakthrough,'' he said. ``We had examined a lot
of populations before _ and by pure chance the results proved it
was the Tuvans.''
	   Scientists have established that 30,000 to 40,000 years ago,
people with Asian roots migrated across ice sheets of Siberia's
Bering Strait to Alaska, likely pursuing animals such as woolly
mammoths. And Geneticists speculate that America's first
inhabitants, numbering perhaps no more than 5,000 people, came from
northern China or Mongolia.
	   But Zakharov's research brings that thinking into sharper focus.
	   In an expedition he led last year to the Ak Dovurak region 2,100
miles southeast of Moscow, Zakharov took hair samples from about
430 Tuvans. He analyzed the DNA contained within the hair root and
compared it to that of Eskimos and so-called Amerindian people,
including the Navajo and Apache.
	   Zakharov found that Amerindian DNA makeup exactly matched the
Tuvans _ by 72 percent of one group of 30 samples and 69 percent of
another group of 300.
	   ``This (represents) the highest frequencies of Amerindian DNA
types ever found,'' he said. ``Several years ago some American,
Russian, and Mongolian scientists investigated Mongolian and
Chinese populations. The frequency of the same DNA types was nearer
to 45 percent.''
	   Tuva, one of Russia's poorest regions, sits at the border of
Siberia's huge Taiga Forest and the steppes, or plains north of
Mongolia. The Tuvans are a mainly nomadic, Turkic-speaking people.
They herd camels, sheep, goats reindeer and yak. In the 18th and 19
centuries, their land formed part of the Chinese empire.
	   ``It was a total surprise,'' Orlan Cholbeney, head of the Tuva
mission in Moscow, said of Zakharov's findings. ``If we have a
mutual past, then we hope it will promote cooperation with the
Americans.''
	   Zakharov posted a summary of their findings in a recent issue of
the American Journal of Human Genetics. He said he would like next
to study residents of the bordering Khakassia and Altai regions,
who he thinks might have an even higher DNA match with Amerindians.
	   But a lack of money, not uncommon among Russian scientists, is a
major obstacle.
	   ``I think this discovery is fascinating, but I have no grants to
continue this project,'' he said.
	   Zakharov said he hopes other researchers who have expressed
interest in his work _ including Italian, American, and Brazilian
scientists _ will help keep it going.
	   The Christian Science Monitor is published in Boston.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian Orthodox archbishop of the southern
region of Tatarstan was stabbed in the face by a burglar after
trying to chase him down, a news report said Tuesday.
	   Archbishop Anastasy and his assistant, who was stabbed in the
arm, were hospitalized in Kazan, Tatarstan's capital.
	   The two priests heard someone fiddling with the lock on their
house late Monday. They opened the door and confronted the burglar,
and he ran off, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Anastasy and his assistant tried to chase him, but he turned
around and stabbed them with a knife, the report said.
	   The suspect has been detained. He told police he had lost his
way and knocked at the archbishop's door to ask directions.

Juventus coach will decide his future in ten days
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TURIN, Italy (AP) _ Coach Marcello Lippi, whose five-year
contract with twotime defending league Juventus expires next June,
said Tuesday that he'll announce his plans for the next season
within ten days.
	   Lippi, a highly-regarded coach, is expected to leave the Turin
team and join either Lazio of Rome or Internazionale of Milan.
	   Lippi said he will unveil his future plans following a deciding
Champions League match against Rosenborg Wednesday and a crucial
league match against leader Fiorentina.
	   Uncertainties about Lippi's whereabouts were cited by some
critics as one reason for Juventus current crisis.
	   The Turin team, winless since Nov. 1, has slipped to fifth place
in the league standings and its qualification for the Champions Cup
quarterfinals is at risk.

Yeltsin remains hospitalized, out of public view

 &UR; With PM-Russia-Failing Yeltsin, Bjt &QL; 
 &UR; By NICK WADHAMS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin, still recovering from pneumonia,
walked around his hospital grounds today, but gave no indication of
any new surprise forays to the Kremlin.
	   The president roused himself from his sickbed for three hours
Monday and fired several top aides, including some who have
commented recently on Yeltsin's weakened health.
	   But Yeltsin continued to keep his distance from Russia's
pressing economic problems. The Russian economy slumped earlier
this year, partly in response to Asia's economic travails, and
plummeted after Aug. 17, when the government devalued the ruble and
temporarily froze foreign debt payments. Yeltsin fired almost his
entire Cabinet as a result of that decision.
	   Presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said doctors allowed the
president to take brief walks around the hospital grounds today for
the first time since he was hospitalized with pneumonia Nov. 22.
	   ``That means he is on the way to recovery,'' Yakushkin was
quoted as saying by the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Yakushkin said Yeltsin was working on documents, but had no
meetings planned and would remain hospitalized as long as necessary
to recuperate.
	   Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov said Yeltsin's actions
Monday made no real difference to the running of the country.
	   ``He is not governing anything any longer,'' Zyuganov said of
Yeltsin. ``This is simply an agony.''
	   Shown on television Monday evening, Yeltsin _ who rarely seems
so robust as when he is firing someone _ appeared energized as he
scowled and delivered one of his patented tirades.
	   ``Tough discipline, order and reform is what we need,'' Yeltsin
said slowly and sternly as he glared at his staff from the head of
a long table. Aides looked down and busied themselves scribbling
notes.
	   ``You can see how vigorous I am,'' Yeltsin said, according to
Yakushkin.
	   Among those sacked was presidential chief of staff Valentin
Yumashev. A former journalist who ghostwrote Yeltsin's memoirs,
Yumashev had served as chief of staff for nearly two years _ an
eternity in Yeltsin's Kremlin.
	   Gen. Nikolai Bordyuzha, the secretary of the presidential
security council, was appointed the new chief of staff. He
immediately called for tackling corruption.
	   ``Fighting corruption is very important today, including in the
upper echelons of power,'' he told Russia's NTV television.
	   Yakushkin said Yeltsin dismissed the aides because of their
failure to stem crime or respond to several incidents of political
extremism, including anti-Semitic remarks by a Communist parliament
deputy.
	   But the ousters were thought to reflect Yeltsin's unhappiness
over the aides' candid remarks about the president's health.
Yumashev and others have openly said Yeltsin's ailments left him
too weak to handle day-to-day affairs.
	   ``In a situation when the presidential inner circle starts
speaking about the boss as if he were a political outsider, you
have to replace either the president or his aides,'' the business
daily Kommersant said today. ``Yeltsin has chosen the second.''

Pacific port city of Vladivostok declares state of emergency
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in 2nd graf with population of city. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Officials in Russia's Pacific port city of
Vladivostok declared a state of emergency because half the
buildings in the city are without heat as temperatures drop below
freezing, a news report said Monday.
	   Schools and day care centers have been closed, and hospitals
will soon be evacuated if the situation doesn't improve in
Vladivostok, a city of 600,000 people located about 6,400
kilometers (4,000 miles) east of Moscow, according to the Interfax
news agency.
	   Making matters worse, the city was inundated early Monday by a
major snowstorm, Interfax said.
	   City officials blame local energy supplier Dalenergo for the
shortage. They say Dalenergo is poorly managed and doesn't maintain
its equipment.
	   More than 500 apartment buildings in the city aren't getting
heat because of leaks in steam pipes belonging to Dalenergo,
according to Interfax.
	   The Vladivostok city administration sent an emergency appeal to
Russian President Boris Yeltsin requesting that he set up a
commission to resolve the crisis, Interfax said.
	   With no money to buy fuel oil, the city has also had to cut down
output at three heating plants.
	   Almost all apartments in Vladivostok are centrally heated by a
city-run system, and few have alternate means of heating their
homes aside from costly and dangerous electric heating devices.
	   Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, providing heat through
the winter has been a major problem for towns in Russia's Far East,
where money is scarce for fuel supplies.

Alternative Nobel winners just say 'no,' then follow with 'yes'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JIM HEINTZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ In the view of this year's winners of
the ``alternative Nobels,'' being positive begins with a negative _
saying ``No.''
	   One of the winners of the Right Livelihood awards is saying no
to plans to build a habitat-destrying Chilean dam, two others are
saying no to corporations that push the use of cancer-causing
substances or pressure mothers not to breast-feed their children,
and the last no is aimed at deeply rooted cultures of repression
and resentment.
	   The Right Livelihood awards were founded by philanthropist Jakob
von Uexkull in 1980 to recognize the kinds of social activist work
that he believes gets ignored by the Nobel Prizes.
	   Although the awards are much smaller than the Nobels _ 450,000
kronor (dlrs 56,250) apiece this year compared with the Nobels' 7.6
million kronor (dlrs 950,000) _ the prizes have developed
substantial prestige, enough that they are presented each year in
the Swedish Parliament on the day before the Nobels.
	   This year's prizes go to Samuel Epstein, chairman of the
U.S.-based Cancer Prevention Coalition; Juan Pablo Orrego and his
group fighting the damming of the Bio Bio river; the International
Baby Food Action Network, and Croatian peace activists Vesna
Terselic and Katarina Kruhonja.
	   Terselic of the Croatian Anti-War Campaign said Tuesday at a
news conference that a critical element of her work was in teaching
people they can stand up against heavy-handed governments and
warlords who inflame ethnic tensions.
	   ``The culture where we live is still a culture of obedience, a
culture of silence,'' she said.
	   Although Croatia's war ended in 1991, ``we who live there could
say the war is not over. The society has to be much more tolerant
than it is now,'' said Kruhonja, from the Center for Peace,
Non-Violence and Human Rights.
	   Ira Puspadewi of the IBFAN said she learned to say no after
seeing her first child becoming frequently sick while feeding on
infant formula.
	   At first ``I was very happy when the sales person, through a
nurse, gave me two cans ... I was very loyal to that brand,'' said
the Indonesian woman. But the child's illnesses prompted her to try
breast-feeding for her second child, who has been sick only rarely,
she said.
	   Epstein, who teaches at the University of Illinois-Chicago,
criticized officials in many countries for the ``standard
industrial philosophy'' _ giving more attention to diagnosing and
treating cancer than to preventing it.
	   He proposes an absolute ban on the introduction of new
substances known to cause cancer and more effort to make the public
aware of health information that now ``remains buried in government
and industrial files and inaccessible scientific literature.''
	   Orrego not only opposes plans to dam the Bio Bio because they
would destroy the habitat of indigenous peoples, but said Chile's
growing reliance on hydropower from dams makes the country's power
grid extremely vulnerable to drought.

Russia assails U.S. for `unfriendly' comment on Cyprus missile
</HEADLINE>
deal &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's foreign ministry on Tuesday protested to
the United States over a recent comment by a U.S. diplomat about
the sale of Russian anti-aircraft missiles to Cyprus.
	   When asked about the missiles, the U.S. ambassador to Cyprus,
Kenneth Brill, said last week: ``We would like them to go anywhere
but Cyprus.''
	   The comments were ``unfriendly,'' the Russian Foreign Ministry
said in a statement.
	   ``The Russian side has underlined the inadmissibility of outside
interference into the purely commercial deal,'' the statement said.
	   Russia is selling S-300 missiles to the ethnic Greek part of
Cyprus. Turkey, which controls the northern third of Cyprus, has
threatened to use military force to prevent their deployment,
planned for early next year.
	   The United States and the European Union have criticized Cyprus
for buying the missiles, warning it would aggravate tensions on the
divided island.
	   Greek Premier Costas Simitis recently proposed setting up the
missiles on the Greek island of Crete to avoid being dragged into
hostilities with Turkey. Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides refused
the offer.
	   Cyprus has been split into a Greek Cypriot-controlled south and
a Turkish-occupied north since Turkey invaded and occupied its
northern third in 1974. A breakaway Turkish Cypriot state in the
north is only recognized by Ankara which maintains 35,000 troops
there.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Following advances in U.S. experimentation, a
government advisory panel said Tuesday that Britain should allow
continued research into the cloning of human embryos for the
treatment of disease, but maintain the ban on cloning to create
babies.
	   The British scientists said U.S. experiments in which
researchers grew ``master'' cells of human tissues from an embryo
have huge potential for medical treatment. It is thought the
technique, by which any type of adult cell could theoretically be
made, could lead to the creation of heart, kidney and other tissue
to replace diseased parts of the body.
	   In the United States, publicly funded embryo research is banned
and in Germany and France it is not allowed at all.
	   British law bans human reproductive cloning _ whereby the
genetic information in an egg is replaced with that from another
cell and then reinserted in the womb _ and restricts research
conducted on human embryos for medical purposes.
	   Embryos less than 14 days old may only be used for research into
the treatment of infertility and congenital disease, but research
cannot be aimed at developing replacement tissue, as was done in
the United States last month.
	   ``Although such applications are still some years away, we
believe that it would not be right at this stage to rule out
limited research using such techniques, which could be of great
benefit to seriously ill people,'' said Sir Colin Campbell,
chairman of the Human Genetics Advisory Commission.
	   The government asked the commission and the Human Fertilization
and Embryology Authority in January to make recommendations on the
ethical and legal issues involving cloning. The Department of
Health said it will respond early next year.
	   In a joint report, the scientists advocated extending to growing
tissue in laboratories the purposes for which embryo research can
be carried out and suggested a review in five year's time.
	   The recommendations drew praise from other scientists, but
condemnation from those who fear cloning for medical treatment will
inevitably lead to the creation of identical copies of human
beings.
	   Dr. Harry Griffin, assistant director at the Roslin Institute in
Edinburgh, Scotland, which created Dolly the sheep, the world's
first cloned mammal, applauded the report's position rejecting
reproductive cloning.
	   ``We are also pleased that the report recognizes that there are
other applications of cloning in human medicine that have great
potential to benefit mankind,'' he said. ``The use of cloning in
cell therapy promises to provide radical new treatments for a
number of common diseases like Parkinson's, diabetes and strokes.''
	   But Patrick Dixon, author of ``Futurewise,'' a book which warns
of the dangers of unrestrained research, said: ``This is the
perfect Christmas present for those who want to press ahead with
human cloning.''
	   Last week, U.N. officials called for a universal code of ethics
for cloning and genetic engineering.

Court orders Surinamese government to pay hospital
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARAMARIBO, Suriname (AP) _ A supreme court justice has ordered
the Surinamese government to pay an unpaid hospital bill of dlrs
740,000 (368 million guilders).
	   The bill from the Diakonessen Hospital covers 100 beds that the
hospital reserves for poor patients from the country's interior. It
has been unpaid since February, hospital officials claim.
	   On Monday, Judge John von Niessewand ordered the Ministry of
Social Affairs to pay the bill and a 37,000 late fee.
	   Dozens of hospitals in Suriname complain the cash-strapped
government is months behind on payments.
	   Last week, the government transferred dlrs 4.2 million (guilders
2.1 billion) to the State Illness Fund to cover overdue doctors'
fees from 1997.

Boesak defense to ask for fraud case to be dismissed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: MOVES UP background on pillars of prosecution's case; RECASTS
and EDITS to conform; NO pickup &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Lawyers for former top African
National Congress official Allan Boesak said Tuesday they would
seek the dismissal of fraud charges against him after key pillars
of the prosecution's case collapsed.
	   To prove that the former minister had embezzled a million rand
(dlrs 300,000 at the time) from an anti-apartheid organization, the
prosecution had relied on testimony from Boesak's former bookkeeper
and from American singer Paul Simon, who donated money to the
group.
	   But the bookkeeper, Freddie Steenkamp, recanted his testimony
last month.
	   The court ruled Tuesday that it would not seek a statement in
New York from Simon, who has refused to fly to South Africa because
of a busy schedule.
	   One of Boesak's lawyers, Mike Maritz, said the defense would
submit the motion to dismiss the case on Monday. Judge John
Foxcroft postponed the trial until then.
	   Boesak says he's innocent of any criminal wrongdoing and
expressed confidence the motion would be successful.
	   ``I feel great,'' Boesak told The Associated Press. ``We go into
this week with a lighter heart and that is always a good feeling.''
	   Boesak, who once headed the World Alliance of Reformed Churches,
is accused of embezzling the money from a private group, the
Foundation for Peace and Justice.
	   The donations came from Simon, the Coca-Cola Foundation,
Scandinavian aid agencies and other individuals and groups. Boesak
is charged with 32 counts of fraud and theft.
	   Prosecutor J.C. Gerber had hoped to present testimony from the
singer and songwriter, who had helped raise funds for the
anti-apartheid cause through concerts and records.
	   Foxcroft rejected Gerber's appeal to either move the court to
the United States for the testimony or appoint a court official to
take the evidence in New York.
	   One of the most damaging moments for the state came on Nov. 17,
when Steenkamp reversed testimony from his own trial that had
fingered Boesak as a thief.
	   Steenkamp, who is serving six years for embezzlement, has
apologized for lying and said a grudge caused him to make false
charges.
	   Boesak played a prominent role in the anti-apartheid struggle
that ended in the country's first all-race elections in 1994.

Church officials say pope stop in Cuba unlikely
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ The pope's envoy to Mexico says it is
unlikely that Pope John Paul II will stop in Cuba while traveling
to Mexico and the United States next month.
	   ``We don't know anything, but it's improbable,'' papal nuncio
Justo Mullor said Monday at a news conference to discuss details of
the pope's visit to Mexico Jan. 22-26.
	   Cuban President Fidel Castro said at an economic meeting
Wednesday that he had heard rumors the pope might consider visiting
Cuba during his trip, but there were no plans for a stop. The pope
visited Cuba in January and Castro said Wednesday that a papal
visit ``would always be welcome.''
	   Mullor said the pope's schedule is very tight. He will travel to
St. Louis on Jan. 26 before returning to Rome.

	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ AC Milan's German keeper Jens Lehmann, who
had started the season as No. 1 and is currently sitting on the
substitutes bench, said Tuesday he was pondering a possible
parting.
	   ``If I don't play I may consider the possibility to leave,''
Lehmann said at Milan's training camp.
	   ``I will take a decision by Christmas,'' added Lehmann, who
signed a three-year contract with the Milan team in the offseason.
	   A wrist injury and some unimpressive performances of the German
keeper have taken back Sebastiano Rossi between AC Milan posts.

Whereabouts of ex-Haitian dictator unclear

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The whereabouts of Haitian former dictator
Jean-Claude Duvalier were murky Tuesday, a day after a group of
Haitian exiles launched an effort to track him down and put him on
trial.
	   The lawyer for Duvalier, Sauveur Vaisse, insisted that Duvalier
``was still in France two weeks ago and is still likely here.''
	   The French Interior Ministry said Monday it had ``lost track''
of Duvalier, who has lived in France since he fled Haiti in 1986,
and that he probably left the country.
	   But Gerald Bloncourt, who on Saturday founded a committee to
bring Duvalier to trial for crimes against humanity, accused the
French government of protecting the ex-dictator and said he
believed ``Baby Doc'' was still in France.
	   ``A few weeks ago he was seen on the Champs-Elysees with two
bodyguards,'' he said in an interview.
	   Bloncourt said that if the ex-dictator flees, his group ``will
contact people in the country where he is located, to continue the
action'' to try him for the deaths of 60,000 people.
	   France has a history of hosting former dictators and strongmen
such as Mobutu Sese Seko of the former Zaire, Lebanese warlord
Michel Aoun and the late Shah of Iran.
	   Bloncourt said the campaign to try former Chilean dictator
Augusto Pinochet, and this week's 50th anniversary of the Universal
Declaration of the Human Rights, has recharged his decades-long
effort to prosecute Duvalier.
	   ``Today with the effort against Pinochet, and with the will
behind the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, I think Duvalier
can be judged, and the people around him too.''
	   The 72-year-old Bloncourt, a longtime leftist activist who was
condemned to death in Haiti and fled in 1946, said his decades-long
struggle included embassy sit-ins and hunger strikes.
	   Compared to Pinochet, he said, ``Duvalier was proportionally
more cynical and murderous. With Duvalier it was the extermination
of the entire opposition.
	   Tens of thousands of people were massacred and tortured to death
during the 31-year father-and-son dynasty of Francois and
Jean-Claude Duvalier, which ended in 1986 when ``Baby Doc'' fled
after several weeks of demonstrations.
	   The younger Duvalier, now 47, lived for a time on the Cote
d'Azur and then, following financial difficulties, moved to the
Paris region in 1993. He allegedly lost a large part of his fortune
when he was separated from his wife, Michele Bennett.

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Leaders on opposite sides of Germany's debate over
how to remember the Holocaust found common ground Tuesday during
talks aimed at generating goodwill as parliament moves toward
considering a national Holocaust memorial.
	   The meeting between Ignatz Bubis, the leader of Germany's Jews,
and former Hamburg mayor Klaus von Dohnanyi was the first
reconciliation in a bitter nationwide argument that flared over an
author's statement that past Nazi horrors are overemphasized.
	   Novelist Martin Wasler, in a November acceptance speech for a
prestigious literary prize, complained that media images of the
Holocaust are designed to perpetuate German guilt.
	   His speech touched off weeks of German media commentary _ and
few pundits were as far apart as Bubis and Dohnanyi.
	   The Jewish leader called the speech ``spiritual arson.'' The
former mayor supported Walser, and added that he doubted Jews would
have behaved any better than ordinary Germans during the Third
Reich if the situation had been reversed.
	   On Tuesday, they took their comments back. ``Spiritual arson,''
might have been too strong, Bubis conceded, and he really didn't
mean to call Walser anti-Semitic. For his part, Dohnanyi agreed his
statement comparing Jews and ordinary Germans was not sensible.
	   They also said they found their shared opinions outweigh their
differences, pointing out their agreement that a national Holocaust
monument is necessary and that remembering the Third Reich should
be an ongoing dicussion.
	   Both men lost relatives under the Nazi terror: Dohnanyi's
father, Hans, was killed in April 1945 for plotting against Hitler,
and Bubis' entire family perished in the Auschwitz death camp in
Nazi-occupied Poland.
	   Despite his conciliatory mood, Bubis emphasized that the debate
over Walser's speech was not over. Many people _ including Dohnanyi
_ think the next step toward reconciliation is a meeting between
Bubis and the author himself.
	   Parliament speaker Wolfgang Thierse has offered to mediate talks
between the two, and so has Eugene DuBow, the head of the American
Jewish Committee in Berlin. So far Walser has refused.
	   Neither leader shed light on plans for the national memorial,
even though that was the professed reason for bringing them
together for their talk in Bonn, still the seat of government as
Germany prepares to move it to Berlin next year.
	   Parliament is to debate suggestions for the memorial early next
year. Former Chancellor Helmut Kohl, voted out in elections Sept.
27, had supported plans for a massive monument in Berlin, near the
Brandenburg Gate. The favored design, by U.S. architect Peter
Eisenman, features 2,700 close-set concrete pillars that resemble a
graveyard.
	   The new government, led by Gerhard Schroeder, supports the
argument that a monument isn't educational enough and that a better
memorial would be to preserve existing reminders of the Third Reich
horror such as former concentration camps _ may of which are in
disrepair.
	   A third idea on the table comes from Berlin Mayor Eberhard
Diepgen and, indirectly, from Hollywood director Steven Spielberg.
Diepgen proposes combining Spielberg's film archive of interviews
with Holocaust survivors with an existing exhibit of the Nazi
regime.
	   The Topography of Terror exhibit displays Third Reich documents
and photographs in the cellar of the former Gestapo and SS
headquarters in Berlin, where Nazis tortured political prisoners.
	   Spielberg already has offered to move his Shoah Visual History
Foundation to Berlin, according to German media reports, and
Diepgen has written to Spielberg encouraging the plan.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The FBI opened its Frank Sinatra files
Tuesday, releasing more than 1,200 pages of documents touching on
his unproved allegations of ties to the Communist Party, and a mug
shot from his 1938 arrest on seduction charges.
	   The documents offered a hodgepodge of facts, allegations and
rumors about Sinatra _ from an unfounded report that he dodged the
draft to any number of threatening letters to the singer.
	   According to the FBI, Sinatra had already seen the material
after filing his own request in 1979 and 1980. The FBI came up with
1,300 pages of information on Sinatra, and released all but 25 of
the pages.
	   The papers also indicate that the FBI received information on
Sinatra from the late columnist Walter Winchell. A 1944 Winchell
item about alleged threats to kidnap Sinatra's baby was duly noted.
And Winchell tipped the FBI that same year that Sinatra had paid
dlrs 40,000 for a 4-F draft classification during World War II.
	   An investigation found Winchell's charge was baseless.
	   Another section of the papers included a March 31, 1955, letter
from the agents in charge of the Philadelphia office to FBI
Director J. Edgar Hoover reporting that a confidential informant
``advised that ... Frank Sinatra, well-known radio and movie star,
is a member of the Communist Party.''
	   Another memo from an agent in Detroit said redacted sources had
reported that Sinatra ``was never active in the CP or related front
group activities in the state of Michigan.''
	   Sinatra's mug shot, taken by the Bergen County, New Jersey,
sheriff's office in 1938, was included as well. So was a report
that Sinatra and two business partners _ his friend, Jilly Rizzo,
and reputed mob boss Carlo Gambino _ had lost dlrs 100,000 in a bad
stock deal.
	   Among the other papers on Sinatra: a federal report on the plane
crash that killed Sinatra's mother, Dolly; a report of a 1966 bomb
threat against Sinatra in Miami Beach; and a 1969 death threat in
which Sinatra was given the option of a dlrs 2 million donation to
the Vatican in return for his life.
	   The sender of the last letter was not prosecuted, but turned
over for psychiatric care.
	   The files were released in response to requests by news
organizations under the Freedom of Information Act.

Moi says economic crisis will worsen in Kenya because of
</HEADLINE>
corruption &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ President Daniel arap Moi said Tuesday
that Kenya is facing an economic crisis that will worsen in the
coming year because of rampant corruption in all the government
ministries.
	   ``Despite the fact there is global economic recession facing
South Asia, Europe and Russia, the situation in Kenya is more
serious than ever before,'' Moi said at Kisii, about 375 miles (600
kilometers) northwest of the capital Nairobi.
	   Kenya is so rife with high-level corruption that the
International Monetary Fund last year suspended a dlrs 220 million
loan to the country until it cleans up the graft.
	   Last May, Finance Minister Simeon Nyachae announced the
government was broke and said a major reason was customs officials
taking bribes not to collect duties on imported goods.
	   Moi warned Tuesday that any civil servant caught in corrupt
handling of funds will face a life sentence in prison.
	   ``I have today directed the police to track down the economic
saboteurs and the law will be applied sternly,'' he said.
	   ``Government officers who have perpetuated corruption in various
ways are to take full responsibility.''
	   Since coming to power in 1978, Moi has regularly promised to
tackle corruption.

<SLUG> Diana's former lover sues to get letters back </SLUG>


<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Princess Diana's former lover James Hewitt has
sued the law firm handling her estate in an attempt to recover love
letters she wrote to him, which he says were stolen.
	   The former army officer claims 64 letters written to him by the
princess between 1989 and 1991 were taken from his home by a
subsequent girlfriend and have emerged in the possession of the law
firm handling her estate.
	   Hewitt claims in legal documents that the letters, signed either
in Diana's own name or with a pseudonym, were taken from a safe in
his home, then were passed to a staff member at Kensington Palace,
then to a police detective, and finally to the law firm of Lawrence
Graham. The firm has not responded to his requests for return of
the letters, the lawsuit says.
	   His former fiance, model Anna Staiano Ferretti, was arrested in
April amid allegations that she tried to sell the letters to the
tabloid newspaper The Mirror for 150,000 pounds (dlrs 247,500). The
Mirror handed the letters over to the late princess' private office
at Kensington Palace, without publishing them.
	   Police later announced Ferretti would not be prosecuted. Had the
case gone to trial, the letters could have become court exhibits.
	   The princess's mother, Frances Shand Kydd, said she and the
other executors of her daughter's will would be happy to hand the
letters back provided Hewitt guaranteed their ``safe keeping.''
	   After Hewitt cooperated in a 1994 book about their affair,
called ``Princess in Love,'' Diana acknowledged the relationship
and said he had let her down. The affair began when he gave her
riding lessons and the two are believed to have exchanged many
letters, handwritten on blue airmail paper, when he served as a
tank commander in the Persian Gulf War.
	   Diana was killed in an auto accident in Paris Aug. 31, 1997.

	   Earlier Tuesday, officials attending a summit of the GCC told
The Associated Press that oil ministers of the member nations have
agreed to reduce production starting in March. They also said the
ministers have agreed to ask other producers in the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries to join them in the cuts.
	   The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
ministers also agreed to ask Mexico, which is not an OPEC member,
to join in cutting back production.
	   The oil ministers are accompanying the leaders of the GCC
countries, which groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar

Annan warns against military intervention without U.N. approval
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Eds: Fixes typo in Albright's title, graf 12, `Annan's remarks &QL; 
 &UR; By DEBORAH SEWARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ In an apparent warning to NATO, U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan told the French parliament Tuesday
that all military action by the international community must have
Security Council approval.
	   ``Doing it without its consent, as some are tempted to do, would
create an unfortunate precedent,'' Annan said, without naming any
specific organization or country.
	   French lawmakers applauded Annan's remarks, made in a speech to
the National Assembly as part of ceremonies marking the 50th
anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
	   ``It's important to stress that while regional organizations do,
undoubtedly, have an important role to play, any military
intervention by the international community must be approved by the
Security Council,'' Annan said.
	   A departure from this practice, Annan told his French audience,
would mean a ``return to a system of spheres of influence founded
on the individual interests of states rather than the principle of
shared responsibilities.''
	   Annan's remarks appeared to be directed at NATO, where during
the Kosovo crisis there was discussion of bypassing the Security
Council, and intervening directly, if U.N. approval were not
forthcoming.
	   NATO Secretary General Javier Solana suggested that the alliance
did not need U.N. backing to launch air strikes against Yugoslavia.
	   The threat of air strikes was being used to force Yugoslav
leader Slobodan Milosevic to remove some of his forces from Kosovo.
	   But some NATO members, particularly Germany, expressed
reservations about any military intervention by the alliance that
did not expressly have a green light by the Security Council.
	   And Russia, a member of the Security Council, made it clear that
it would not support a resolution authorizing air strikes.
	   The issue also came during the Iraq crisis, when U.S. officials
indicated they wouldn't need U.N. backing to intervene.
	   Annan's remarks came the same day that U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said in an interview that the alliance didn't
need U.N. approval for all its actions.
	   Asked whether NATO always have to have a specific U.N. mandate,
Albright told the influential daily Le Monde: ``No.''
	   ``It's clear that it's very good when NATO and the United
Nations can act together,'' Albright said. ``But the alliance
cannot be hostage of a veto of this or that country against an
operation. Because in such a case, NATO would be nothing more than
a branch of the United Nations.''

Italian rider promises world 500-cc title by 2000

<TEXT>
	   BOLOGNA, Italy (AP) _ Italian rider Max Biaggi, who recently
signed with the Japanese team Yamaha, said Tuesday he was prepared
to clinch the world 500-cc title within the next two years.
	   ``By 2000 I'll be the world champion (in motorcycle racing), I
can promise you,'' Biaggi told a crowd of young fans at Bologna
Motor Show, a major motor exhibition.
	   ``Everybody expect me to win the 500-cc title and I'm engaging
hard to beat (defending world champion Michael) Doohan earn Yamaha
a world laurel,'' the Italian rider said.
	   Biaggi, a former 250-cc world champion, placed second to Doohan
as he debuted in the 500-cc championship this year, on a Honda.

throughout &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A judge who ruled that Gen. Augusto Pinochet does
not have immunity from arrest is a director of a charity run by
Amnesty International, the group campaigning for the former Chilean
dictator to face charges of genocide and murder acknowledged
Tuesday, while lobbyists stepped up pressure over Spain's request
for his extradition.
	   Shouting ``take your hands out of Chile,'' Pinochet supporters
demonstrated outside Prime Minister Tony Blair's Downing Street
office, and opponents planned a wreath-laying for victims of his
secret police.
	   ``We are widows of members of the armed forces and policemen
that were killed in terrorist attacks by Marxist terrorist groups
in Chile,'' said Veronica Vallejos who handed in a letter on behalf
of 700 families urging the government to block extradition of the
83-year-old general and send him home.
	   Controversy over links with Amnesty International of South
African-born Lord Justice Leonard Hoffmann was the latest twist in
the tug-of-war over Pinochet, a regular visitor to Britain who was
arrested Oct. 16 on a Spanish warrant.
	   Home Secretary Jack Straw must decide by Friday whether
extradition proceedings can go ahead following the 3-2 ruling Nov.
25 by five judges of Britain's highest court, the House of Lords,
against Pinochet.
	   He is awaiting Straw's decision under police guard in a rented
mansion at Wentworth, some 20 miles (30 kms) west of London.
	   A Chilean government report says 3,197 people were murdered or
disappeared at the hands of the secret police during Pinochet's
1973-90 rule after he overthrew Salvador Allende, an elected
Marxist. But Chile's government wants him back, partly to avoid
exacerbating domestic tensions and threatening the country's newly
built democracy.
	   Amnesty International said Hoffmann, 64, an opponent of
apartheid who settled in Britain in the `60s, has served since 1990
as the unpaid director and chairman of Amnesty International
Charity Ltd. which gets donations for work on human rights.
	   His wife, Gillian, also a liberal South African, is a secretary
in Amnesty International's press office in London.
	   Hoffmann and his wife had no involvement in the Pinochet
campaign, said Amnesty International spokeswoman Soraya Bermejo.
She accused Pincohet supporters of trying to divert attention from
the basic issue of whether he should be tried.
	   ``There are many lawyers who have links with human rights
organizations,'' Ms. Bermejo told the AP.
	   ``In fact when Lord Hoffmann was appointed to this case we saw
him as being slightly unpredictable on a human rights,'' she added,
noting that he recently ruled against a man who was sentenced to
death sentence in the Bahamas, a former colony which still allows
appeals to Britain's highest court.
	   In the Pinochet case, the five judges _ in an usual move _
allowed lawyers for Amnesty International to make representations.
	   The judges included another native South African, Lord Johan
Steyn, who also ruled against Pinochet.

Estonia eases citizenship rules
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TALLINN, Estonia (AP) - The parliament on Tuesday passed a bill
granting citizenship to thousands of stateless children, a move the
government hopes will take the edge off a dispute with Russia and
improve Estonia's chances of joining the European Union.
	   Cabinet ministers broke into applause when they heard the bill
was passed by a 55-20 vote in the Riigikogu legislature, said
government spokesman Daniel Vaarik.
	   ``This vote shows we are dealing with some of the problems we
have in Estonia and that we are dealing with them seriously,'' he
said.
	   Moscow has sharply criticized Estonia's citizenship laws, saying
they discriminate against the country's 400,000 ethnic Russians,
most of whom do not have citizenship.
	   Under Soviet rule, hundreds of thousands of ethnic Russians
moved to Estonia. When Estonia became independent in 1991, it
granted citizenship only to pre-Soviet residents and their
descendants. Children born of non-citizens since independence also
have been stateless.
	   The new law provides automatic citizenship for such children,
currently an estimated 6,000.
	   The old laws had also been criticized by the European Union,
which Estonia ardently wants to join. The citizenship issue was
seen as a major impediment to EU membership.
	   Estonia's non-citizens are eligible for naturalization but must
meet the tough reaquirement of showing proficiency in Estonian, a
language entirely unrelated to Russian. Most of the ethnic Russians
have little or no grasp of Estonian, having grown up and worked in
Russian-speaking communities.
	   Critics of the bill said Estonia was caving in to pressure from
Russia and the European Union. They also said having thousands of
new citizens who weren't able to cope in Estonian could pose a
threat to Estonian culture.
	   Russia has long argued that citizenship should be granted to
everyone with no conditions, and Georgy Chekhoyev, deputy chairman
of a Russian parliamentary committee on the welfare of Russians in
the Baltics, reacted coolly to the new Estonian law.
	   ``A partial liberalization is hardly likely to solve the
problem,'' Chekhoyev was quoted as saying by the Baltic News
Service.

<TEXT>
	   The GCC summit comes less than two weeks after OPEC ministers
adjourned a testy, year-end meeting in the Austrian capital Vienna
without agreeing on measures to halt the slide in oil prices.
	   Instead of agreeing to further production cuts or to extend
previously agreed cutbacks, the 11-nation cartel decided to review
the situation in March.
	   The inaction sent markets into gyrations.
	   Shortly before the GCC meeting began, January futures contracts
for Brent crude _ a widely watched benchmark _ fell to a record low
of dlrs 9.92 a barrel on the International Petroleum Exchange in
London. The contracts closed at dlrs 10.26.
	   Gulf oil generally sells at a dollar or two less than the North
Sea's Brent _ which itself was selling for around dlrs 20 a barrel
as recently as 1997.
	   The Gulf countries, which together sit on half the world's
proven oil reserves and depend on exports for 75 percent of their
revenues, have been hard hit by plummeting oil prices.
	   On Monday, Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Abdullah said that ``the
main source of our income has been greatly shaken by the imbalance
of the oil market.''
	   ``Such an imbalance requires us to exert our utmost efforts
inside and outside OPEC,'' said Abdullah, who is leading the Saudi
delegation to the GCC in place of his ailing half-brother, King
Fahd.
	   He called for new and serious measures to restore market balance
and ``not hesitate to take further measures for the common
interest.''

<TEXT>
	   Earlier Tuesday, officials attending a summit of the GCC told
The Associated Press that oil ministers of the member nations have
agreed to reduce production starting in March. They also said the
ministers have agreed to ask other producers in the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries to join them in the cuts.
	   The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
ministers also agreed to ask Mexico, which is not an OPEC member,
to join in cutting back production.
	   The oil ministers are accompanying the leaders of the GCC
countries, which groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar
and the Emirates. All except Oman and Bahrain are members of OPEC.
	   Their three-day summit ends Wednesday.
	   The GCC summit comes less than two weeks after OPEC ministers
adjourned a testy, year-end meeting in the Austrian capital,
Vienna, without agreeing on measures to halt the slide in oil
prices.
	   Instead of agreeing to further production cuts or to extend
previously agreed cutbacks, the 11-nation cartel decided to review
the situation in March.
	   The inaction sent markets gyrating.
	   Shortly before the GCC meeting began, January futures contracts
for Brent crude _ a widely watched benchmark _ fell to a record low
of dlrs 9.92 a barrel on the International Petroleum Exchange in
London. The contracts closed at dlrs 10.26.
	   Gulf oil generally sells at a dollar or two less than the North
Sea's Brent _ which itself was selling for around dlrs 20 a barrel
as recently as 1997.
	   The Gulf countries, which together sit on half the world's
proven oil reserves and depend on exports for 75 percent of their
revenues, have been hard hit by plummeting oil prices.
	   On Monday, Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Abdullah said that ``the
main source of our income has been greatly shaken by the imbalance
of the oil market.''
	   ``Such an imbalance requires us to exert our utmost efforts
inside and outside OPEC,'' said Abdullah, who is leading the Saudi
delegation to the GCC in place of his ailing half-brother, King
Fahd.
	   He called for new and serious measures to restore market balance
and ``not hesitate to take further measures for the common
interest.''

Schmitt beats three Japanese for his fourth win this season
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with quotes &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PREDAZZO, Italy (AP) _ Germany's Martin Schmitt beat double
Olympic champion Kazuyoshi Funaki in Tuesday's ski jumping event at
Predazzo to clinch his fourth season victory and hold a commanding
lead in the overall World Cup standings.
	   Schmitt, with jumps of 128.5 and 125 meters from the 120-meter
hill, totaled 253.7 points to edge Funaki by 3.7 points.
	   Funaki, who jumped 121.5 and 126 meters, led teammates Noriaki
Kasai and Kazuya Yoshioka who placed third and fourth respectively
in an impressive showing by the Japanese team.
	   Norway's Lasse Ottesen edged another Japanese jumper, Masahiko
Harada, for fifth place.
	   Schmitt, who placed third to Finland's Janne Ahonen and Funaki
at Chamonix in the only World Cup event he did not win so far this
season, piled up 460 points overall, compared with Ahonen's 372 and
Funaki's 330.
	   The German ace said it looked like his lucky year, following
four wins in five events.
	   ``At the moment I'm just very happy. I prefer to go on step by
step. The Japanese are very strong, but I'm not really afraid of
them,'' said Schmitt, who has been often training at the Predazzo
hill last summer.
	   Funaki extended his winless streak to five events as he finished
second for the second time in three days.
	   However he did not look disappointed.
	   ``I'm quite satisfied with my performance (today). I'll
certainly improve my jumping style by the World Championship in
Ramsau,'' he said.
	   Other top finishers included Norway's Morten Aagheim (7th),
Ahonen (8th) and Germany's Sven Hannawald (9th).
	   Austrian great Andreas Goldberger ended tenth.
	   The event was held in the north Italian resort which will host
the world nordic events championships in 2003.
	   The next World Cup round is scheduled at Oberhof, Germany, this
weekend.

Polgar, Karpov match in question, Polgar vs Kasparov likely
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ The Las Vegas ``battle of the sexes''
match between chess champions Anatoly Karpov and Zsuzsa Polgar is
off for now for lack of funds, the state-run news agency MTI
reported Tuesday.
	   ``Until the prize money has been placed with a lawyer, there is
no sense discussing a match,'' said Laszlo Polgar, the
father-manager of the three Polgar grandmasters, denying earlier
reports of a dlrs 300,000 tournament in Las Vegas this month.
	   Karpov, 47, is the reigning champion of the World Chess
Federation, known by its French acronym FIDE. Zsuzsa Polgar, 29, is
the reigning world women's champion.
	   She became a grandmaster in 1991 and once beat Karpov, the
world's fifth-ranked player.
	   Her sister, Judit, 21, the world's top female chess player,
defeated Karpov in June in Budapest.
	   Laszlo Polgar said Judit will likely play against Garry Kasparov
next year, but did not specify any details.
	   The third Polgar daughter, Zsofia, is also among the world's top
20 female chess players. Zsofia is one year younger than Judit.

Serb negotiator criticizes American plan for Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The top Serb negotiator Tuesday
criticized an American peace plan for Kosovo, saying it paves way
for turning the province into a separate state.
	   Ratko Markovic, head of Serbian government team for talks with
ethnic Albanians, said the U.S. draft threats Kosovo ``as an issue
of reconstructuring the whole of Yugoslavia and the creation of a
new federal unit with a tendency to turn Kosovo into a new state.''
	   Kosovo is a province in Serbia, the dominant republic in
Yugoslavia.
	   ``According to that plan, Kosovo would be a state for the
Albanians with their domination in all spheres of life and state
institutions, with no guarantees and protection for other ethnic
minorities,'' Markovic said in a statement issued after talks with
a delegation of Russian lawmakers.
	   The statement, carried by Tanjug news agency, added ``Serbia
sees solution of the Kosovo problem within its legal system and
through realization of self-rule for the territory of Kosovo and
all of its ethnic communities.''
	   Markovic added Serbia ``is ready to discuss enhancing the
autonomy for Kosovo and implementation of the highest international
standards in protection of rights of ethnic minorities.''
	   Markovic's comments came after ethnic Albanians Monday rejected
the American plan drafted by envoy Christopher Hill, blasting it as
pro-Serb.

The new NATO must go beyond its immediate borders
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES throughout with fresh details, quotes. No
Pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright said Tuesday that NATO must be prepared to take action
beyond its borders and dismissed suggestions that this amounts to
creating a new ``global NATO.''
	   ``We are neither altering the North Atlantic Treaty nor
attempting to create some kind of a new `global NATO,''' she said.
``What we are doing is using the flexibility the treaty always
offered to adapt this alliance to the realities of a new strategic
environment.''
	   Albright was speaking to fellow NATO foreign ministers, gathered
here to discuss the major issues that will be presented to the
16-nation alliance's summit April 24-25 in Washington. Also
attending were ministers from Poland, Hungary and the Czech
Republic, which will become members next year.
	   One of the main summit issues will be updating NATO's strategic
concept, the military and political principles that define its
mission. In practice, that means updating theory to reflect what
NATO has been doing for years.
	   With the fall of the Berlin wall and the end of the Warsaw Pact,
the alliance has moved away from its strategy of defending against
a massive tank attack across Central Europe to new challenges, such
as regional conflicts, ethnic violence, terrorism and the spread of
weapons of mass destruction.
	   ``We must be prepared because we know that events beyond NATO's
immediate borders can affect vital alliance interests,'' Albright
said. ``This is why we acted in Bosnia. This is why we have come
together to prevent renewed violence in Kosovo.
	   ``Common sense tells us that it is sometimes better to deal with
instability when it is still at arms length that to wait until it
is at our doorstep.''
	   The central mission of NATO will always be collective defense,
but that doesn't preclude new missions.
	   ``One of the special qualities of the alliance has always been
its ability to react flexibly to new situations,'' said German
Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer. ``On the eve of the 21st century
we should ask ourselves if our instruments still match the changed
security environment.''
	   Albright rejected suggestions by some critics that taking on
these new missions would undermine NATO's original intent. ``I've
said it before; I will repeat it again today: this is hogwash,''
she said.
	   ``A ballistic missile attack using a weapon of mass destruction
from a rogue state is every bit as much a ... threat to our borders
now as a Warsaw Pact tank was two decades ago.''
	   Fischer made waves when he called on NATO last month to consider
dropping its doctrine allowing a nuclear first-strike. This
doctrine, reaffirmed as recently as last year, has always been a
part of NATO's nuclear strategy and is considered an important
aspect of deterrence.
	   The idea, long a plank in the platform of Fischer's Green Party,
doesn't win much support within the alliance, but many are willing
to discuss it.
	   ``Only in a climate of arms reduction can we fight against
weapons of mass destruction,'' Fischer said. ``When we succeed in
reducing the significance of nuclear weapons, then we will have
achieved a lot.''
	   France, one of the alliance's three nuclear powers, is
unenthusiastic.
	   ``Our country has nothing against arms reduction,'' said French
Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine. ``At the same time, nuclear
deterrents tend to be considered in France as having helped
preserve peace.''
	   The ministers also deplored the continued violence in Kosovo,
where sporadic killings keep puncturing a shaky cease-fire between
Serb security forces and ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent
of the population.
	   NATO forced an end to the fighting with the threat of airstrikes
and has dispatched a rapid reaction force to neighboring Macedonia
ready to intervene to protect the 2,000 civilian cease-fire
``verifiers'' now deploying.
	   ``Kosovo is a critical test not only for NATO, but for Europe's
larger security structure,'' Albright said.
	   A statement from the ministers blamed both the Serb and ethnic
Albanian sides for the violence.
	   The ministers also agreed that the NATO-led multinational
peacekeeping force in Bosnia should be left at its current
32,000-troop level. A final decision will be made by defense
ministers at their meeting next week.

GCC denies cutting oil production
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Combines BULLETIN series, INCORPORATES Gulf-Oil &QL; 
 &UR; By ANWAR FARUQI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ The Gulf Cooperation
Council on Tuesday denied that its member countries had agreed to
cut oil production in a bid to boost sagging world prices, an Arab
television network reported.
	   GCC secretary-general Jamil al-Hojeilan said in an interview
with the Middle East Broadcasting Corp. that a report about the
production cut was ``unfounded,'' officials at the television said.
	   They said the interview will be broadcast later Tuesday.
	   MBC staffers quoted al-Hejailan as saying that the best the GCC,
which comprises six Gulf Arab countries, can do to keep oil prices
from falling is to make sure that its members stick to their
quotas.
	   MBC, a satellite television network, refused to disclose the
full text of the interview immediately.
	   Earlier Tuesday, officials attending a summit of the GCC told
The Associated Press that oil ministers of the member nations have
agreed to reduce production starting in March. They also said the
ministers have agreed to ask other producers in the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries to join them in the cuts.
	   The oil ministers are accompanying their leaders at the the
summit meetings of the GCC, which includes Saudi Arabia, Kuwait,
Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and the Emirates. All except Oman and Bahrain
are members of OPEC.
	   Their three-day summit ends Wednesday.
	   The GCC meeting comes less than two weeks after OPEC ministers
adjourned a testy, year-end meeting in the Austrian capital Vienna
without agreeing on measures to halt the slide in oil prices.
	   Instead of agreeing to further production cuts or to extend
previously agreed cutbacks, the 11-nation cartel decided to review
the situation in March.
	   The inaction sent markets into gyrations.
	   Shortly before the GCC meeting began, January futures contracts
for Brent crude _ a widely watched benchmark _ fell to a record low
of dlrs 9.92 a barrel on the International Petroleum Exchange in
London. The contracts closed at dlrs 10.26.
	   Gulf oil generally sells at a dollar or two less than the North
Sea's Brent _ which itself was selling for around dlrs 20 a barrel
as recently as 1997.
	   The Gulf countries, which together sit on half the world's
proven oil reserves and depend on exports for 75 percent of their
revenues, have been hard hit by oil prices that plummeted because
of the recession in Asia and warmer-than-usual winters.
	   On Monday, Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Abdullah said that ``the
main source of our income has been greatly shaken by the imbalance
of the oil market.''
	   ``The boom days are gone and will never come back to the
region,'' he said.
	   ``Such an imbalance requires us to exert our utmost efforts
inside and outside OPEC,'' said Abdullah, who is leading the Saudi
delegation to the GCC in place of his ailing half-brother, King
Fahd.
	   He called for new and serious measures to restore market balance
and ``not hesitate to take further measures for the common
interest.''
	   The Gulf producers have been grappling with widening budget
deficits and problems paying foreign debts. Saudi Arabia, for
example, had projected a dlrs 4.8 billion budget deficit for 1998,
but analysts predict it will reach dlrs 15 billion.
	   ``The projected increases in the GCC budget deficits are
expected to leave a negative impact on their economic
development,'' said Mohammad Khalfan Khirbash, the Emirates
minister of finance.
	   GCC countries were expected to invest up to dlrs 90 billion in
major projects in the next five years, of which dlrs 25 billion was
to go for the oil and gas sectors. Those plans may have to be
scaled down _ or shelved altogether.
	   In the defense sector alone, the Gulf Arab countries have bought
tens of billions of dollars in arms over the past decade. They were
expected to spend another dlrs 80 billion more over the next four
years.

being investigated as part of a doping scandal that plagued the
Tour de France, judicial officials said Tuesday.
	   The cyclists, who were not identified, had been expected to be
released Tuesday, after 24 hours of questioning.
	   But authorities ordered them to remain at Lyon police
headquarters, the officials said on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   Police from Lille, where judge Patrick Keil is investigating
doping at the disgraced Festina team, traveled to Lyon to question
the cyclists.
	   During the Tour, Casino cyclist Rodolfo Massi was put under
formal investigation, one stage short of being charged, for
breaking French anti-doping laws.

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ In the latest disagreement between Poland
and Israel, Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek's government on Tuesday
scrapped a deal reached last year to buy Israeli-made missiles for
the Huzar helicopter.
	   The reversal drew a terse response from Israel's Defense
Ministry, which hinted at possible legal and political fallout from
the decision by Buzek's Cabinet.
	   It also continued a series of disputes between Israel and Poland
that reveal strained relations rooted in Jewish perceptions of
Polish anti-Semitism dating back to the Holocaust and decades of
communist rule in Poland while Israel was closely allied with the
United States.
	   Announcing the decision after Tuesday's weekly Cabinet meeting,
Buzek accused Israel of reneging on an agreement by Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu to allow Poland to field test the NTD missile
under local conditions.
	   Buzek also called the missile deal signed by Poland's previous
leftist government a preliminary agreement. He said scrapping it
will have no legal or financial consequences, the state news agency
PAP reported.
	   Israel's Defense Ministry disputed Buzek's position in a brief
statement.
	   ``From Israel's point of view, the agreement that was signed in
October 1997 is still in force,'' the ministry said. ``Israel is
now considering its response _ political and legal.''
	   Following five years of negotiating with several potential
partners, Poland last year awarded the dlrs 800 million contract to
Israel's Rafael and Elbit Systems Ltd. companies to equip the Huzar
helicopters in line with NATO requirements.
	   Under the deal, which required approval from both governments,
Rafael was to supply the Huzar with anti-tank NTD missiles and
Elbit was to provide electronic integrating systems.
	   But Buzek's Solidarity-led government, which took office shortly
after the agreement was signed, criticized the handling of the
tenders by its ex-communist predecessors and demanded missile
tests.
	   It also decided to seek another tender for the integrating
systems, but has set no date for it.
	   Grzegorz Holdanowicz, who writes for the Polska Zbrojna military
magazine, noted the 1997 agreement with Israel made no mention of
field tests.
	   ``So the other side can say you demanded things that were not
mentioned in the agreement,'' he said, adding that Netanyahu's deal
was made verbally in April and therefore may be a non-issue.
	   With Poland scheduled to join NATO next year, it is trying to
bring its military arsenal up to NATO standards to meet all
requirements for membership.
	   The NTD missile experienced problems when tested in Israel from
February to July, according to Jane's Defense Weekly, a respected
military magazine. It reported in August that some missiles tested
in southern Lebanon went awry, with one killing a civilian.
	   Buzek said Tuesday that Israel wanted an eight-month
postponement in testing the missiles in Poland, which he called
``unacceptable.''
	   Holdanowicz noted that scrapping the deal with Israel further
delays equipping the Huzar with anti-tank weapons, but he added:
``If there are so many questions around this missile, some of them
real, some imagined, then we do not know how in the end it could
work out.''
	   Poland's decision adds to a list of disputes with Israel.
Earlier this year, the Israeli government-run Yad Vashem Holocaust
museum formally complained to Poland's government about crosses
erected on a property adjoining the Auschwitz Nazi death camp, now
a museum.
	   On Monday, Poland announced that Israel refused to extradite a
Polish Jew who allegedly committed atrocities against German
prisoners in 1945.

	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ U.S. Health Secretary Donna Shalala sang
the praises of Lebanon's postwar reconstruction Tuesday, saying
Beirut was ``a city of hope and opportunity.''
	   Speaking of the country where her mother was born, Shalala told
students at the American University of Beirut that Lebanese people
had shown ``unbelievable strength of character'' in overcoming the
devastation of the 1975-90 civil war.
	   ``As I drove here today, I saw a booming city. A city of new
buildings - with more on the way. A city that is still the jewel of
this nation and the Middle East. A city with an energetic people -
led by a dynamic new president. A city of hope and opportunity,''
Shalala said.
	   A multibillion dollar reconstruction program is under way in
Beirut.
	   Shalala urged the people of Lebanon's 17 religious sects to
``work hard'' and to cooperate.
	   At the end of her speech, Shalala laid flowers at the campus
site where AUB President Malcolm Kerr was assassinated by gunmen in
1984.
	   Founded in 1866, AUB is the university that introduced American
education to the Middle East. Its alumni include three presidents
and 10 prime ministers of Lebanon.
	   Shalala arrived in Lebanon on Friday and has toured the north
and east of the country. On Monday she held talks with
newly-elected President Emile Lahoud, telling reporters afterward
that Washington was impressed by his Cabinet.
	   Shalala is due to leave Lebanon early Wednesday by flying by
helicopter from the U.S. Embassy to Cyprus. Beirut airport, once
infamous for hijackings, remains off-limits to American officials.

Judge decides to wait on Tyson probation action
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW with judge deciding to take no action at this time &QL; 
 &UR; By HANK LOWENKRON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) _ The judge who could return Mike Tyson to
prison will await the former heavyweight boxing champion's
sentencing on assault charges before making her decision.
	   Indiana state Judge Patricia Gifford followed a recommendation
from probation officer George Walker, who said in a probation
report it ``may be desirable to await the outcome'' of misdemeanor
assault charges against Tyson in the state of Maryland.
	   Tyson pleaded ``no contest'' _ a formal plea which does not
admit guilt but acknowledges the prosecution has enough evidence to
convict _ in the suburban Washington, D.C., case last week. No
sentencing date has been set.
	   Walker sent official notice of the Maryland charges to Gifford
on Tuesday, noting Tyson had completed more than 3 1-2 years of his
four years of probation ``with no criminal arrests, and he has been
otherwise compliant and cooperative with this officer.''
	   Walker also noted to Gifford that Tyson has completed more than
the required community service, completed a special counseling
program for sex offenders and continues weekly counseling. His
probation is scheduled to expire in March.
	   Tyson served three years for rape in Indiana, and Gifford will
decide whether he violated terms of his 1995 parole. Two motorists
said he kicked and punched them after an automobile accident in
Maryland in August. His sentencing is expected early next year,
although the Montgomery County District Court in Maryland said no
date has been set.
	   Gifford, who did not return a phone call Tuesday, could have
issued a warrant for Tyson's arrest or scheduled a hearing on the
report from Walker, the chief probation officer for Marion Superior
Court.
	   Indiana authorities also reviewed the probation _ but took no
action _ after Tyson bit Evander Holyfield's ears during a title
bout in June 1997. The Nevada Athletic Commission stripped Tyson of
his boxing license but reinstated him in October.
	   Tyson plans to fight Francois Botha on Jan. 16. A news
conference was scheduled for Tuesday in Los Angeles to announce the
bout.
	   Walker had said last week Gifford will have great latitude in
responding to his report.
	   ``The judge can do everything from nothing all the way to
imposing the originally suspended sentence, and anything in
between,'' he said.
	   In the Maryland assault case, Tyson faces up to 20 years in
prison _ 10 years on each count _ and be fined up to dlrs 5,000.
The two men he scuffled with already have agreed to a settlement to
avoid a civil suit.
	   Tyson is training in the Phoenix area and intends to live there.
He already has registered as a sex offender in Arizona as part of
his planned move.
	   Tyson was convicted Feb. 10, 1992, of one count of rape and two
counts of deviate sexual conduct. Gifford sentenced Tyson to 10
years in prison and suspended four. He was released from the
Indiana Youth Center on March 25, 1995, and put on probation for
four years.

GCC denies cutting oil production

<TEXT>
	   ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ The Gulf Cooperation
Council on Tuesday denied that its member countries had agreed to
cut oil production in a bid to boost sagging world prices, an Arab
television network reported.
	   Earlier Tuesday, officials attending a summit of the GCC told
The Associated Press that GCC oil ministers have agreed to reduce
production starting in March. They also said the ministers have
agreed to ask other producers in the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries to join them in the cuts.
	   But GCC secretary-general Jamil al-Hojeilan said in an interview
with the Middle East Broadcasting Corp. that the report was
``unfounded,'' officials at the television said.
	   They said the interview will be broadcast later Tuesday.
	   MBC staffers quoted al-Hojeilan as saying that the best the GCC,
which comprises six Gulf Arab countries, can do to keep oil prices
from falling is to make sure that its members stick to their
quotas.
	   MBC, a satellite television network, refused to disclose the
full text of the interview immediately.
	   The GCC comprises the six Gulf Arab countries of Saudi Arabia,
Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and the Emirates. All except Oman and
Bahrain are members of OPEC.
	   Its oil ministers are accompanying their leaders at a three-day
summit meeting that is scheduled to end Wednesday.

Doctor guilty of supervising HIV-tainted blood to hemophiliacs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ A Red Cross doctor was found guilty Tuesday of
supervising the distribution of HIV-infected blood products to
hemophiliacs and given a one-year suspended prison sentence.
	   A Geneva court held that Prof. Alfred Haessig, the 77-year-old
former director of the Swiss central laboratory of the Red Cross,
put people at risk through his actions in the 1980s. The court said
he had acted out of ``pride and stubbornness.''
	   The case was brought after official complaints were made by
eight infected Swiss hemophiliacs. Four have since died, but the
court noted that they probably were infected before April 1985,
which meant that any crime involving them was beyond prosecution
because of the Swiss statute of limitations.
	   District Attorney Bernard Bertossa said that as a scientist
Haessig would have been aware starting in 1982 that there was a
risk blood products could transmit the AIDS virus.
	   Yet, Bertossa said, Haessig continued to supervise the
manufacture of the blood products until November 1985 and the
distribution of them until the following May. Safer options existed
but he failed to use them, the prosecution argued. Haessig retired
in 1987.
	   Among the victims were brothers Miguel and Francisco Fernandez,
who gave a statement before their deaths in 1994 and 1995 that they
had never been warned of the danger from the blood products.
	   ``We needed it. We had no choice. You have to have confidence in
doctors,'' the statement said.
	   The Red Cross laboratory provided 80 per cent of the blood
products for hemophiliacs in Switzerland at the time of the
contamination. Doctors told the court that they had thought the Red
Cross products were particularly good, describing the Swiss mark as
``a label of quality.''
	   Haessig admitted that he had not used pasteurization because he
had believed it was less efficient in treating the hemophiliacs.
	   ``I did nothing wrong, but certain things could have been done
better,'' Haessig told the court, expressing regret.
	   The three-judge panel said that because of the statute of
limitations they could rule only that he could have endangered
life, but that in actual fact he had not done so.
	   Haessig was also cleared of a charge of grievous bodily harm.

Furor erupts in Ontario over strip search of 20 ninth-graders
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAVID CRARY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ A high school vice principal and gym teacher have
been ordered to stay away from students after they conducted a mass
strip search of ninth-grade boys in quest of some stolen money.
	   The strip search, carried out last week at Kingsville District
High School in southwestern Ontario, prompted a walkout by about
200 students Monday. On Tuesday, Ontario Premier Mike Harris joined
in the widespread condemnation of the search, calling it repulsive.
	   The incident occurred Friday, when gym teacher Dan Bondy
summoned vice principal John McDonald to help him search students
after none of the 20 boys in a gym class would admit to having
stolen dlrs 90 from a fellow student.
	   The two staff members ordered the boys to come one by one into
an office, where they were subjected to a strip search. The stolen
money was not found.
	   After complaints from parents and students, education officials
opened an investigation of the incident and ordered MacDonald and
Bondy to stay away from students for the time being.
	   ``In my 33 years in education I've never heard anything like
this,'' said Val Pistor, director of education for the regional
school board. He called the search a ``violation of the rights,
dignity and respect of children.''
	   Harris, a conservative who favors back-to-basics reforms in the
public school system, had no sympathy for the two staff members.
	   ``I personally think back to teenage years and Grade 9 and the
challenges of puberty and of a very sensitive age and I can't
imagine that there is a teacher or vice principal anywhere in
Ontario that would have been party to anything like this,'' he
said. ``I find it abhorrent.''
	   Canada's Supreme Court has ruled teachers and principals have
the right to search students on school premises if they believe
school rules are being broken. But the court set guidelines on when
searches are reasonable and how they should be conducted.
	   Ontario's education minister, Dave Johnson, said searches are
supposed to be limited to a search for weapons and drugs, not
money. He said strip searches at schools are never acceptable.
	   Kingsville is about 25 miles (40 kilometers) southeast of
Windsor, Ontario.

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Saying they had new evidence that the
United Nations had warnings about preparation for the 1994 Rwanda
genocide, a group of U.S. and Belgian legislators demanded an
investigation into why the world body failed to act.
	   The lawmakers want to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to set
up an inquiry commission to investigate warnings that elements
linked to the Hutu-led government was planning to slaughter Tutsis.
The state-sponsored genocide killed an estimated 500,000 people
from the Tutsi-ethnic minority and moderates among the Hutu
majority.
	   On the eve of the 50th anniversary of the U.N. Genocide
Convention, Belgian Sen. Alain Destexhe and U.S. Rep. Cynthia
McKinney presented a U.N. document showing what they called clear
identification of genocide planners, well before the killing
started in April 1994.
	   ``What's the use of remembering the Genocide Convention if you
don't do anything when it happens,'' said Destexhe, who initiated
senate hearings into the killings in Rwanda, a former Belgian
colony.
	   ``It is of paramount importance to know what the United Nations
and the United States knew of the possibility of genocide and
massive killings in Rwanda and why they did not move to prevent
this,'' Rep. McKinney said in a statement.
	   They called for a U.N. investigation to be carried out by an
independent panel of experts. McKinney also called for a further
U.S. investigation after a congressional hearing held in May.
	   The two legislators said they had obtained an ``interoffice
memorandum'' of the U.N. Assistance Mission in Rwanda, dated Feb.
17, 1994, warning that a Hutu ``death squad'' was planning to kill
two government opponents.
	   The victims were named as Landoald Ndasingwa, co-founder of
Rwanda's Parti Liberal and Joseph Kavaruganda, president of the
nation's constitutional council. Destexhe said both were killed in
the first days of the genocide.
	   He said the letter also named the heads of the death squad as
figures close to late Hutu President Juvenal Habyarimana whose
death in an unexplained aircrash sparked the genocide. Destexhe
claimed the letter was evidence the death squad members were
preparing for a wider killing spree.
	   Annan was head of U.N. peacekeeping operations at the time, he
says the U.N. force in Rwanda lacked the military might and
political backing to stop the slaughter.
	   Destexhe said Annan could have done more to prevent the genocide
after receiving a Jan. 11, 1994 fax from the U.N. commander Gen.
Romeo Dallaire that he had been informed that extremists were
planning to exterminate Tutsis. Dallaire wanted to raid an
extremists' arms cache but Annan overruled him, citing the limits
of a U.N. mandate, Destexhe said.
	   ``Annan had other options,'' said Destexhe, saying he could have
leaked such information to influential media or sending a warning
to the U.N. Security Council.

Juventus coach to decide future in 10 days
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TURIN, Italy (AP) _ Coach Marcello Lippi, whose five-year
contract with two-time defending Italian league champion Juventus
expires in June, said Tuesday that he'll announce his plans for
next season within 10 days.
	   Lippi is expected to leave the Turin club and join either Lazio
of Rome or Internazionale of Milan.
	   Lippi said he will unveil his plans after Juventus's next two
games: Wednesday's European Champions League match against
Rosenborg and a crucial league match against Fiorentina.
	   Uncertainties about Lippi's plans were cited by some critics as
one reason for Juventus current slump.
	   Juventus has been winless since Nov. 1, has slipped to fifth
place in the league standings and is on the verge of elmination
from the European Champions Cup.

Kosovo rebels reject U.S. peace draft
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to UPDATE throughout with Serbs also rejecting latest US
plan &QL; 
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbs and ethnic Albanians joined
Tuesday in rejecting the latest U.S. plan for Kosovo, despite a
NATO appeal for the two sides to show a spirit of compromise in the
search for peace in the embattled province.
	   Ratko Markovic, head of Serbian government team for talks with
ethnic Albanians, said the U.S. draft would require
``reconstructing the whole of Yugoslavia'' and would pave the way
for independence for the majority Albanian province.
	   On Monday, the chief ethnic Albanian negotiator, Fehmi Agani,
rebuffed the plan, saying it made too many concessions toward the
Serbs.
	   On Tuesday, Adem Demaci, chief spokesman of the rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army, joined in criticizing the plan, drafted by
American envoy Christopher Hill. Demaci suggested Hill was biased
and should be replaced.
	   ``Mr. Hill either doesn't understand the Albanian problems, or
he is leaning toward the Serbs,'' Demaci said. ``The State
Department should reconsider the results of his work ... (and) send
us more qualified people.''
	   Although the KLA is not a party to the deliberations, its
support is considered critical to the ensuring that any future plan
actually brings peace to the province, where ethnic Albanians
outnumber Serbs 9-to-one.
	   Kosovo is a province in Serbia, the dominant republic in
Yugoslavia.
	   Hundreds of people were killed and almost 300,000 ethnic
Albanians forced from their homes in a seven-month crackdown on
separatists by Serbian forces before an October peace accord.
	   The October accord, reached under threat of NATO airstrikes, was
seen as a way to buy time to allow diplomacy to find a solution
acceptable to both Serbs and ethnic Albanians.
	   But with little sign of diplomatic progress, fears are mounting
that fullscale fighting could erupt, perhaps in the spring, when
snows will melt along the mountain passes to Albania, where the
rebels maintain sanctuaries.
	   In Brussels, Belgium, NATO foreign ministers endorsed U.S.
diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis and called on Serbs and
ethnic Albanians to ``move rapidly in a spirit of compromise and
accommodation.''
	   The ministers also reaffirmed that any settlement must respect
the territorial integrity of Yugoslavia, putting them at odds with
the ethnic Albanians who are seeking independence for the majority
Albanian province.
	   The Americans and Europeans fear independence would lead to
similar demands by other ethnic Albanian communities elsewhere in
the southern Balkans.
	   In rejecting the Hill plan, Demaci acknowledged that the KLA was
using lull in the fighting to rearm and prepare for more battles
with government troops.
	   ``The KLA has no illusion that the (Serb) regime will
democratize overnight and that it will give up trying to find a
solution through force for the Kosovo crisis,'' he said. ``It would
be dangerous if the Albanians don't continue arming themselves and
preparing for resistance.''
	   In a statement issued in Brussels, NATO foreign ministers
deplored the violence in Kosovo, blaming both Serbs and ethnic
Albanians.
	   ``Since the beginning of November, violent incidents provoked in
some cases by Serbian security forces and in others by armed
Kosovar elements have increased tension,'' the ministers said.
``(Both sides) have failed to comply fully with the requirements
set on in U.N. Security Council resolutions.''
	   The NATO ministers reaffirmed their support for a political
solution ``which provides an enhanced status for Kosovo, a
substantially greater degree of autonomy and meaningful
self-administration'' but which ``preserves the territorial
integrity'' of Yugoslavia.
	   The U.S.-based Human Rights Watch, meanwhile, claimed Tuesday
that more than 1,000 Kosovo Albanians are being held in Serbian
prisons and police stations, and said at least five have died from
beatings and torture.
	   The statement, faxed to The Associated Press bureau in Belgrade,
said hundreds of others have been injured from beatings and
torture.

Russia assails U.S. for `unfriendly' comment on Cyprus missile
</HEADLINE>
deal &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's foreign ministry on Tuesday protested to
the United States over a recent comment by a U.S. diplomat about
the sale of Russian anti-aircraft missiles to Cyprus.
	   When asked about the missiles, the U.S. ambassador to Cyprus,
Kenneth Brill, said last week: ``We would like them to go anywhere
but Cyprus.''
	   The comments were ``unfriendly,'' the Russian Foreign Ministry
said in a statement.
	   ``The Russian side has underlined the inadmissibility of outside
interference into the purely commercial deal,'' the statement said.
	   Russia is selling S-300 missiles to the ethnic Greek part of
Cyprus. Turkey, which controls the northern third of Cyprus, has
threatened to use military force to prevent their deployment,
planned for early next year.
	   The United States and the European Union have criticized Cyprus
for buying the missiles, warning it would aggravate tensions on the
divided island.
	   Greek Premier Costas Simitis recently proposed setting up the
missiles on the Greek island of Crete to avoid being dragged into
hostilities with Turkey. Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides refused
the offer.
	   Cyprus has been split into a Greek Cypriot-controlled south and
a Turkish-occupied north since Turkey invaded and occupied its
northern third in 1974. A breakaway Turkish Cypriot state in the
north is only recognized by Ankara which maintains 35,000 troops
there.

Items on Marko Viduka; Dennis Wise; BSkyB's Manchester United bid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GLASGOW, Scotland (AP) _ According to sick Australian soccer
star Marko Viduka, Glasgow Celtic should not have to pay a penny of
his 3 million pound transfer fee until he plays for them.
	   Viduka signed for Celtic from Croatia Zagreb last week but then
returned to Zagreb saying he was depressed and not mentally fit to
play.
	   With his old club demanding the transfer see, Celtic owner
Fergus McCann said he wouldn't pay until Viduka started playing.
McCann was reported to have flown to Croatia to sort out the
problem.
	   Meanwhile, Viduka's agent, Bernie Mandic, said that the player
agreed with McCann.
	   ``Marko has not cost Celtic a single pound to date and it is
debatable whether they will have to pay at the moment,'' Mandic
said.
	   ``But that is what Marko is trying to say. He is not after money
from Celtic and he would prefer that until he can perform on the
park for them that no money should exchange hands.''

	   LONDON (AP) _ After collecting three red cards in four months,
Chelsea midfielder Dennis Wise should make the most of his
appearance at home to Aston Villa on Wednesday.
	   It will be his last at Stamford Bridge until next year.
	   Against Everton on Saturday, Wise was expelled in the first half
for his second yellow card. He was only just back from a four-game
ban.
	   Wise also missed three games at the start of the campaign
because of a pre-season expulsion and the three game ban he now
picks up for Saturday's indiscipline means he will have missed 10
games in total before he returns in 1999.
	   Wednesday's game against Premier League leader Villa also may
have its problems.
	   Wise was expelled against Villa in a League Cup game for an
unpleasant two-footed tackle on Darren Byfield that prompted an
angry response from some of the Villa players.

	   MANCHESTER, England (AP) _ Manchester United chief executive
Martin Edwards has agreed to meet the club's fans and discuss their
opposition to BSkyB's proposed 623 million pound (dlrs 1 billion)
takeover of the club.
	   Members of the Independent Manchester United Supporters
Association (IMUSA) will face Edwards, who is in favor of the bid
by Rupert Murdoch's satellite TV company, at Old Trafford on
Thursday.
	   IMUSA officials have said they have been trying for three years
to persuade Edwards to see them and the meeting represents a
breakthrough for the fans' group.
	   ``This will be the first time we will actually sit down with
Martin Edwards after three years of trying,'' IMUSA spokesman Lee
Hodgkiss said.
	   ``In his agreeing to see us he is acknowledging us in some
way.''
	   On Friday IMUSA will also meet officials from the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission, who are investigating the BSkyB takeover to
decide whether it breaches the rules of fair trading.

AC Milan's German keeper pondering possible transfer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ AC Milan's German keeper Jens Lehmann, who
started the season as the starter before being relegated to the
bench, said Tuesday he was considering a transfer.
	   ``If I don't play I may consider the possibility to leave,''
Lehmann said at Milan's training camp.
	   ``I will take a decision by Christmas,'' added Lehmann, who
signed a three-year contract with the Milan team in the offseason.
	   A wrist injury and some unimpressive performances have led
Sebastiano Rossi to replace Lehman as AC Milan's starting
goalkeeper.

DNA link claimed between Siberians and American Indians
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOSTON (AP) _ A Russian geneticist claims he has found an
extensive DNA match between American Indians and a nomadic people
living in a region north of Mongolia.
	   Ilya Zakharov, deputy director of Moscow's Vavilov Institute of
General Genetics, told the Christian Science Monitor's Moscow
bureau that his genetic studies of the Tuvan people in Siberia have
significantly narrowed the search for the exact origin of American
Indians.
	   ``This is a big breakthrough,'' he said. ``We had examined a lot
of populations before _ and by pure chance the results proved it
was the Tuvans.''
	   Scientists have established that 30,000 to 40,000 years ago,
people with Asian roots migrated across ice sheets of Siberia's
Bering Strait to Alaska, likely pursuing animals such as woolly
mammoths. And Geneticists speculate that America's first
inhabitants, numbering perhaps no more than 5,000 people, came from
northern China or Mongolia.
	   But Zakharov's research brings that thinking into sharper focus.
	   In an expedition he led last year to the Ak Dovurak region 2,100
miles southeast of Moscow, Zakharov took hair samples from about
430 Tuvans. He analyzed the DNA contained within the hair root and
compared it to that of Eskimos and so-called Amerindian people,
including the Navajo and Apache.
	   Zakharov found that Amerindian DNA makeup exactly matched the
Tuvans _ by 72 percent of one group of 30 samples and 69 percent of
another group of 300.
	   ``This (represents) the highest frequencies of Amerindian DNA
types ever found,'' he said. ``Several years ago some American,
Russian, and Mongolian scientists investigated Mongolian and
Chinese populations. The frequency of the same DNA types was nearer
to 45 percent.''
	   Tuva, one of Russia's poorest regions, sits at the border of
Siberia's huge Taiga Forest and the steppes, or plains north of
Mongolia. The Tuvans are a mainly nomadic, Turkic-speaking people.
They herd camels, sheep, goats reindeer and yak. In the 18th and 19
centuries, their land formed part of the Chinese empire.
	   ``It was a total surprise,'' Orlan Cholbeney, head of the Tuva
mission in Moscow, said of Zakharov's findings. ``If we have a
mutual past, then we hope it will promote cooperation with the
Americans.''
	   Zakharov posted a summary of their findings in a recent issue of
the American Journal of Human Genetics. He said he would like next
to study residents of the bordering Khakassia and Altai regions,
who he thinks might have an even higher DNA match with Amerindians.
	   But a lack of money, not uncommon among Russian scientists, is a
major obstacle.
	   ``I think this discovery is fascinating, but I have no grants to
continue this project,'' he said.
	   Zakharov said he hopes other researchers who have expressed
interest in his work _ including Italian, American, and Brazilian
scientists _ will help keep it going.
	   The Christian Science Monitor is published in Boston.

Stocks show little change
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks were little changed Tuesday after a weak
start, with the technology group again distinguishing itself from
the pack after rallying to new highs on Monday.
	   At noon Tuesday on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average
was down 7.73 at 9,062.74, having wiped out most of an early
54-point deficit. The blue-chip barometer gained 190 points the
past two sessions, but remains more than 300 points below the
record of 9,374.27 set two weeks ago on Nov. 23.
	   Broader stock indicators were mixed at midday, with declining
issues still outnumbering advancers overall.
	   The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index was up 13.29 at
2,053.93, padding Monday's record-setting gain of 37 points.
	   For the second day in a row, there was no far-reaching news to
steer the market, which has been struggling to regain its momentum
after rallying nearly nonstop for six weeks.
	   Adding to the concern about whether the recovery has been too
enthusiastic was another warning from a major company about the
continuing economic weakness in Asia.
	   Meanwhile, a U.S. diplomat warned today that recent market
optimism in Asia was unjustified and urged governments in the
region to continue making economic and political reforms.
	   ``I see no fundamental change in Asia over the past 90 days to
justify a sustained rally in the financial markets, much less to
sustain economic growth,'' U.S. Ambassador to Singapore Steven
Green told a gathering of businessmen.
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a narrow margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, while Nasdaq decliners led by an 8-to-7
ratio.
	   NYSE volume came to 317.36 million shares, up from 278.12
million midday Monday.
	   The Standard-and-Poor's 500 index was up 1.90 at 1,189.60, the
NYSE composite index was up 0.53 at 577.86, and the American Stock
Exchange composite index was up 4.54 at 668.88.

NATO outsiders impatiently await call up
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; with NATO &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL AMES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Central and eastern European nations
left out of NATO's plan to bring in new members next year are
increasingly frustrated by the lack of clear signs that their
exclusion will soon be ended.
	   Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic are set to join NATO at
an April summit in Washington. Other former communist nations are
told the door remains open for them, but NATO refuses to set a
timeframe for further expansion.
	   Germany's Joschka Fischer expressed the view of many delegates
at Tuesday's meeting of NATO foreign minister when he said the
alliance needs time to ``digest'' the three new members.
	   ``This is not the wolf and the seven little goats,'' said
Fischer, evoking a folk tale of the hungry predator who devoured
too much, too fast.
	   Those left in the cold are increasingly disillusioned at the
prospect of being shut out indefinitely from NATO's protective
umbrella.
	   ``We are actively questioning the credibility of the open-door
policy,'' said Slovenian Foreign Minister Boris Frlec. ``You can
say the door is open, but if nobody can go through, the door is
really closed.''
	   Slovenia and Romania came close to being selected in the first
group invited into NATO when the alliance made its choice of new
partners in 1996, but U.S. insistence on keeping the numbers down
left them on the sidelines.
	   Since then, candidates have intensified military and political
contacts through NATO's Partnership for Peace program. Their
soldiers join NATO maneuvers, their diplomats have offices at NATO
headquarters and their ministers come to NATO meetings.
	   Frlec said that is not enough.
	   ``We have exhausted the possibilities of the the so-called
intensified program,'' he said in an interview.
	   Publicly at least, the outsiders still cling to hopes that the
Washington summit will sent out invitations to a second-wave list
of entrants.
	   ``Lithuania expects (the summit) will launch the next round of
NATO enlargement and invite qualified candidates, including
Lithuania, to start accession negotiations,'' Algirdas Saudargas,
foreign minister of the Baltic republic said on a recent visit to
NATO headquarters.
	   But although NATO has yet to make a final decision, that is
looking unlikely.
	   In her speech to Tuesday's meeting, . Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said the summit should provide ``a road map that
shows aspirants the way ahead'' but without naming possible members
of the next group of entrants. She made no mention of a timetable.

ACB confirms pair took money, deny bribes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: updates with cricket board confirmation, changes headline &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Australian Cricket Board (ACB) chief
executive Malcolm Speed confirmed Tuesday that Australian test
cricketers Mark Waugh and Shane Warne were fined for selling
information to an Indian bookmaker.
	   But The Australian newspaper quoted Speed as saying Waugh and
Warne were not involved in bribery or match-fixing.
	   The newspaper reported the ACB had fined the high-profile pair a
total of
	   18,000 Australian dollars (11,500 US dlrs) for selling weather
and pitch reports to the bookmaker during the 1994 tour of Sri
Lanka and Pakistan.
	   The Daily Telegraph said the pair were fined by the then ACB
chief executive Graham Halbish in 1995 for selling the information
to a millionaire
	   Madras bookmaker during the 1994 one-day tournament in Sri
Lanka.
	   ``Reviewing the file and having spoken to the players about it
as soon as the matter was raised by team management, they realized
that what they had done was wrong and they had put themselves in a
very difficult position,'' Speed was quoted as saying.
	   ``There was no suggestion at any time of any involvement in
bribery or match-fixing.''
	   According to the Australian, the fines were imposed by the ACB
in February 1995, the same month it became public that Warne and
Waugh had been offered 200,000 US dlrs each to play poorly on the
tour of Pakistan - an offer they rejected.
	   Waugh was reportedly fined 10,000 Australian dlrs and Warne
8,000 Australian dollars for selling the information to the
bookmaker.
	   Waugh refused to answer questions on Tuesday, telling The
Australian: ``I don't know where you got your information from, I
don't know if that's right.''
	   The revelations are sure to be of interest throughout the
cricket world, particularly in Pakistan where an official inquiry
has been held into charges
	   of bribery against players.
	   Australia's 1994 tour of Pakistan has become notorious for
charges of match-fixing and bribery leveled against then Pakistani
captain Salim Malik.
	   Waugh, Warne and former player Tim May had accused Malik of
attempting to
	   bribe them. Malik has protested his innocence.
	   Justice Malik Mohammad Qayyum is due to submit his report on the
match-fixing scandal to Pakistan president Mohammad Rafiq Tarar in
the next two weeks.
	   Leg spinner Warne, 29, made his test debut against India in
1991-92 in Sydney, and has toured the sub-continent four times.
	   Warne has taken 308 test wickets at 24.10 to rank among the
all-time great bowlers, but shoulder surgery in April after this
year's tour in India has so far stopped him returning to the test
side.
	   In his autobiography Warne wrote: ``The whole betting scene in
India and Pakistan is illegal so the people running the betting are
basically gangsters. Not the sort of people to trust or play around
with.''
	   Waugh, the twin of vice-captain Steve Waugh, made his debut in
1990-91 against England in Adelaide.
	   The 33-year-old has been a mainstay of Australia's middle order
in 80 test matches, making more than 5,000 runs, averaging around
43. (djp)

Officials: Heads of four kidnapped foreigners found
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. Recasts, UPDATES with new details on heads, UPDATEs with
quote from Yeltsin &QL; 
 &UR; By RUSLAN MUSAYEV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ The severed heads of four kidnapped
foreigners were discovered neatly lined up beside a highway in
Chechnya on Tuesday after a rescue attempt apparently went wrong.
	   The whereabouts of the bodies of the three Britons and a New
Zealander, engineers who had been installing telephone lines across
Chechnya, was unclear.
	   While kidnappings, usually for ransom, have become widespread in
Chechnya since the end of its 1994-96 war for independence from
Russia, hostages are rarely killed _ particularly foreigners. The
gruesome slaying stunned even Chechen officials, and is likely to
aggravate Chechnya's attempts to gain international recognition of
its independence.
	   The deaths were apparently the result of a rescue attempt by
Chechen authorities Monday night that went ``tragically wrong,''
according to Ray Verth, chief executive of Granger Telecom, the
British company the hostages had worked for.
	   Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov said Chechen officials had
caught one of the kidnappers Monday and he told police where the
hostages were being held. But that information reached the other
captors, who decided to kill their captives, the ITAR-Tass news
agency quoted Maskhadov as saying.
	   An Associated Press reporter saw the decapitated heads Tuesday
near the village of Assinovskaya, about 40 kilometers (25 miles)
west of Grozny, the Chechen capital. He did not see any sign of the
bodies.
	   The heads were lined up on a piece of cloth along a main highway
across southern Russia, in plain view of passersby. Two of the
heads had wounds to the temple, possibly gunshot wounds.
	   The victims _ Britons Peter Kennedy, Darren Hickey, and Rudolf
Petschi, and New Zealand's Stanley Shaw _ were identified by Umar
Makhauri, who had been their bodyguard when they were abducted Oct.
3 by unidentified gunmen in Grozny. He said the bodies had not been
found.
	   Maskhadov, however, said in Grozny that the bodies of four men
had been recovered.
	   The heads were taken to the Central Republican Hospital in
Grozny, officials said.
	   Verth said his company had ``opened a dialogue with the
kidnappers and received confirmation that the hostages were alive
as recently as last week.''
	   ``Their murder is an appalling and barbaric act and our thoughts
go out to the families, to whom we offer our deepest condolences.
We are a small tightly-knit company and everyone here is in a state
of shock,'' Verth said Tuesday outside company headquarters in
Weybridge, south of London, where flags were flying at half-mast.
	   Eamon Hickey, the father of one of the missing men, said at his
home in England: ``There is so much rumor and counter-rumor coming
from out there that we don't know what to think. Obviously we are
hoping and praying that it does not turn out to be true.''
	   Russian President Boris Yeltsin expressed outrage at the
killings and urged law enforcement officials to crack down on
kidnapping, presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin told reporters.
	   Yeltsin also warned foreigners to avoid unsanctioned visits to
Chechnya.
	   Maskhadov said the killings were a major blow to Chechnya.
	   ``I am ready to answer before my people and the whole world for
what happened,'' he was quoted as saying by the Interfax news
agency.
	   He blamed the rash of abductions in Chechnya on unidentified
``outside forces'' and their Chechen henchmen.
	   British officials said they had not received any ransom demand
for the missing men.
	   Since the beginning of 1998, 176 people have been kidnapped in
the North Caucasus region of Russia, including dozens of
foreigners, and 90 of them released, officials have said.

Premier certain Greece will be EMU member in 2001

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Premier Costas Simitis Tuesday expressed
certainty that Greece will become a member of the European Monetary
Union by 2001.
	   ``Today, we can predict with certainty that Greece will be the
12th member of EMU in 2001,'' Simitis said at the end of a two-day
conference on the Greek economy.
	   Simitis added that Greece will meet the most difficult criterion
for EMU, a two percent inflation rate, by the end of 1999.
	   He did acknowledge that efforts are still needed to trim
inflation to two percent by the end of next year from an estimated
four percent at the end of 1998.
	   ``Priority is on inflation,'' he said. ``This is where we have
to make the critical step. In about 12 months from now, we have to
achieve an important and difficult reduction.''
	   Simitis said the government recently took a brave step toward
this goal by cutting some indirect taxes and supporting the central
bank's strict monetary policy.
	   He also said the general government deficit will have dropped to
2.2 percent of the gross domestic product, or GDP, at the end of
1998, well below the three percent target required for EMU entry.
	   Simitis also that growth will pick up further in 1999. The
government has estimated that GDP will rise by 3.5 percent in 1998
and will accelerate to 3.7 percent in 1999.

Doctor guilty of supervising HIV-tainted blood to hemophiliacs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Red Cross reaction. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ A Red Cross doctor was found guilty Tuesday of
supervising the distribution of HIV-infected blood products to
hemophiliacs and given a one-year suspended prison sentence.
	   A Geneva court held that Prof. Alfred Haessig, the 77-year-old
former director of the Swiss central laboratory of the Red Cross,
put people at risk through his actions in the 1980s. The court said
he had acted out of ``pride and stubbornness.''
	   The case was brought after official complaints were made by
eight infected Swiss hemophiliacs. Four have since died, but the
court noted that they probably were infected before April 1985,
which meant that any crime involving them was beyond prosecution
because of the Swiss statute of limitations.
	   District Attorney Bernard Bertossa said that as a scientist
Haessig would have been aware starting in 1982 that there was a
risk blood products could transmit the AIDS virus.
	   Yet, Bertossa said, Haessig continued to supervise the
manufacture of the blood products until November 1985 and the
distribution of them until the following May. Safer options existed
but he failed to use them, the prosecution argued. Haessig retired
in 1987.
	   Among the victims were brothers Miguel and Francisco Fernandez,
who gave a statement before their deaths in 1994 and 1995 that they
had never been warned of the danger from the blood products.
	   ``We needed it. We had no choice. You have to have confidence in
doctors,'' the statement said.
	   The Red Cross laboratory provided 80 per cent of the blood
products for hemophiliacs in Switzerland at the time of the
contamination. Doctors told the court that they had thought the Red
Cross products were particularly good, describing the Swiss mark as
``a label of quality.''
	   Haessig admitted that he had not used pasteurization because he
had believed it was less efficient in treating the hemophiliacs.
	   ``I did nothing wrong, but certain things could have been done
better,'' Haessig told the court, expressing regret.
	   The laboratory issued a statement after the verdict expressing
the deepest regret about the distribution of tainted products,
which it said was ``one of the greatest human tragedies of our
time.''
	   It said the quality of blood products was of the highest
priority and that it had taken every administrative and technical
step to continue to improve security.
	   It noted that it had been voluntarily supporting HIV-infected
hemophiliacs since 1989.
	   The Swiss Red Cross also expressed regret over the infections,
which it said could not be undone by the verdict. It said that
safety of its blood supply had been improved since a 1994
reorganization.
	   The three-judge panel said that because of the statute of
limitations they could rule only that he could have endangered
life, but that in actual fact he had not done so.
	   Haessig was also cleared of a charge of grievous bodily harm.

Train conductors vote to continue their strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Despite new proposals offered by the national rail
company, striking conductors in 17 out of 23 regions in France
voted Tuesday to continue their walkout, now in its 13th day.
	   On Monday, Louis Gallois, head of the SNCF _ the rail authority
_ said the 1999 budget foresees stable employee numbers for the
first time in 17 years. Until now, the number of workers has fallen
annually.
	   But the offer was deemed too imprecise by the unions, who are
demanding 600 new posts.
	   Still, roundtable discussions were continuing Tuesday in an
``apparently good'' climate, management reported.
	   Rail traffic was expected to remain disrupted Wednesday. The
strike has not affected high-speed trains leaving from Paris, the
Eurostar to London, and most trains in the Paris region.
	   Elsewhere, only one train out of three was operating on major
lines Tuesday night.

Paris bids to stage 2008 Olympics

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Paris is entering the crowded race for the 2008
Olympics.
	   President Jacques Chirac phoned IOC president Juan Antonio
Samaranch to confirm the city's bid to stage the games, the French
Olympic Committee said Tuesday.
	   Paris is the latest in a long list of cities announcing their
candidacy for the games.
	   Other candidates so far include Beijing; Toronto; Kuala Lumpur,
Malaysia; Buenos Aires, Argentina; Istanbul, Turkey; Osaka, Japan,
and Seville, Spain. Cairo is also weighing a possible bid.
	   China is considered the early strong favorite. Beijing, which
lost narrowly to Sydney in the race for the 2000 games, announced a
bid last week.
	   Samaranch, in Bangkok attending the Asian Games, warmly received
the Paris candidacy.
	   ``It's good news for the Olympic movement,'' Samaranch said.
	   ``Paris is Paris. It's just not another candidate, it's a
special candidate. Besides, France is the home of the founder of
our Olympic movement (Pierre de Coubertin).''
	   There had been speculation that Paris would not submit a bid if
China entered the race. But there is a strong body of opinion that
cities rarely win an Olympic bid at the first attempt and it's
advisable to get into position for a successful run four years
later.
	   With Athens hosting the 2004 Olympics, the International Olympic
Committee is likely to choose a non-European city in 2008. Paris
could be in a strong position for 2012.
	   The IOC will open the bidding next year and select the 2008 host
city in Moscow in 2001.

Officials: Heads of four kidnapped foreigners found
</HEADLINE>

quote from Yeltsin &QL; 
 &UR; By RUSLAN MUSAYEV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ The severed heads of four kidnapped
foreigners were discovered neatly lined up beside a highway in
Chechnya on Tuesday after a rescue attempt apparently went wrong.
	   The whereabouts of the bodies of the three Britons and a New
Zealander, engineers who had been installing telephone lines across
Chechnya, was unclear.
	   While kidnappings, usually for ransom, have become widespread in
Chechnya since the end of its 1994-96 war for independence from
Russia, hostages are rarely killed _ particularly foreigners. The
gruesome slaying stunned even Chechen officials, and is likely to
aggravate Chechnya's attempts to gain international recognition of
its independence.
	   The deaths were apparently the result of a rescue attempt by
Chechen authorities Monday night that went ``tragically wrong,''
according to Ray Verth, chief executive of Granger Telecom, the
British company the hostages had worked for.
	   Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov said Chechen officials had
caught one of the kidnappers Monday and he told police where the
hostages were being held. But that information reached the other
captors, who decided to kill their captives, the ITAR-Tass news
agency quoted Maskhadov as saying.
	   An Associated Press reporter saw the decapitated heads Tuesday
near the village of Assinovskaya, about 40 kilometers (25 miles)
west of Grozny, the Chechen capital. He did not see any sign of the
bodies.
	   The heads were lined up on a piece of cloth along a main highway
across southern Russia, in plain view of passersby. Two of the
heads had wounds to the temple, possibly gunshot wounds.
	   The victims _ Britons Peter Kennedy, Darren Hickey, and Rudolf
Petschi, and New Zealand's Stanley Shaw _ were identified by Umar
Makhauri, who had been their bodyguard when they were abducted Oct.
3 by unidentified gunmen in Grozny. He said the bodies had not been
found.
	   Maskhadov, however, said in Grozny that the bodies of four men
had been recovered.
	   The heads were taken to the Central Republican Hospital in
Grozny, officials said.
	   Verth said his company had ``opened a dialogue with the
kidnappers and received confirmation that the hostages were alive
as recently as last week.''
	   ``Their murder is an appalling and barbaric act and our thoughts
go out to the families, to whom we offer our deepest condolences.
We are a small tightly-knit company and everyone here is in a state
of shock,'' Verth said Tuesday outside company headquarters in
Weybridge, south of London, where flags were flying at half-mast.
	   Eamon Hickey, the father of one of the missing men, said at his
home in England: ``There is so much rumor and counter-rumor coming
from out there that we don't know what to think. Obviously we are
hoping and praying that it does not turn out to be true.''
	   Russian President Boris Yeltsin expressed outrage at the
killings and urged law enforcement officials to crack down on
kidnapping, presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin told reporters.
	   Yeltsin also warned foreigners to avoid unsanctioned visits to
Chechnya.
	   Maskhadov said the killings were a major blow to Chechnya.
	   ``I am ready to answer before my people and the whole world for
what happened,'' he was quoted as saying by the Interfax news
agency.
	   He blamed the rash of abductions in Chechnya on unidentified
``outside forces'' and their Chechen henchmen.
	   British officials said they had not received any ransom demand
for the missing men.
	   Since the beginning of 1998, 176 people have been kidnapped in
the North Caucasus region of Russia, including dozens of
foreigners, and 90 of them released, officials have said.

Film on Solzhenitsyn canceled after family protests
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The broadcast of a documentary marking the 80th
birthday of writer Alexander Solzhenitsyn was canceled because his
family complained it contained unauthorized footage, a newspaper
reported Tuesday.
	   Russia's RTR television station had planned to show ``The Chosen
One'' last Friday on the 25th anniversary of the publication of
Solzhenitsyn's renowned work, ``The Gulag Archipelago.''
	   But it canceled the broadcast less than two hours before it was
to have run.
	   RTR spokesman Andrei Fatyushchenko said the station decided to
honor the wishes of Solzhenitsyn's wife, Natalya, who had written
to RTR chief Mikhail Shvydkoi to protest, the Moscow Times
newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   The footage of the family's private life, made by a filmmaker
who had stayed at the Solzhenitsyns' house, was filmed on condition
it would not be broadcast, Mrs. Solzhenitsyn said in the letter,
which was published by the Kommersant newspaper.
	   The filmmaker, Olesia Fokina, had promised the footage would
only be used for ``future archives,'' Mrs. Solzhenitsyn said.
	   Shvydkoi, the RTR chief, said the film would not be aired ``at
least until both sides come to an agreement,'' the Moscow Times
reported.
	   Russia's other two main television stations have also prepared
documentaries to mark Solzhenitsyn's Dec.11 birthday.
	   Solzhenitsyn's books ``One Day in the Life of Ivan
Denisovitch,'' ``The Gulag Archipelago'' and ``Cancer Ward'' laid
bare the cruelties and repression of the Soviet system.
	   ``The Gulag Archipelago'' was first published in Paris in 1973,
and Solzhenitsyn was arrested and expelled from the Soviet Union
the following year. He lived in Vermont for 18 years, then returned
to Russia in 1994.
	   He enjoyed much more influence as a dissident than he does
today. He is fiercely critical of post-Soviet Russia, but many
Russians find his proposed solutions overly conservative,
nationalistic or irrelevant.
	   Solzhenitsyn won the Nobel prize for literature in 1970.

UN: Education a matter of life and death for millions of children
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Forty percent of elementary school-aged children
in developing countries either never enter school or drop out
before they learn to read, write and count, the United Nations
Children's Fund said Tuesday.
	   They are part of a worldwide crisis where the denial of basic
education is both a matter of life and death for hundreds of
millions of children and a threat to world peace, UNICEF said in
its annual report on the state of the world's children.
	   Although school attendance is rising worldwide, population
increases have dwarfed progress in the developing nations, the
report said.
	   In many industrialized countries, 15-20 percent of students in
many still leave school without the skills needed for finding a
keeping a job, the report said.
	   At a news conference, Carol Bellamy, UNICEF executive director,
said the 21st century will be seen as a race between education and
catastrophe.
	   Children who grow up without basic education find it harder to
support themselves and their families. Education helps people learn
how to achieve fundamental human rights, such as health, nutrition
and safe motherhood, and also helps adults and children learn to
respect diversity in society and to work with others, the report
said.
	   ``On a society-wide scale, the denial of education harms the
cause of democracy and social progress and, by extension,
international peace and security,'' the report said.
	   Nearly a sixth of humanity _ almost a billion people _ will
enter the next century unable to read a book or sign their names,
much less to operate a computer or to understand a simple
application form.
	   And two-thirds of them will be women, she said in the report.
	   Among girls, there is a direct correlation between years of
schooling and death rates of infants and mothers in childbirth.
Education also helps girls to delay marriage, reduce the number of
children they have and resist exploitation, Bellamy said.
	   ``It's a situation that many would call tragic, but it is more
than tragic. It is just wrong, and quite dangerous,'' Bellamy said.
``It's fair to say that basic education has the power to save
lives.''
	   For national governments to allocate the resources to ensure
education for all would cost about t dlrs 7 billion a year over the
next 10 years _ ``Less than is annually spent on cosmetics in the
United States or on ice cream in Europe,'' Bellamy said.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ In a new twist in the tug-of-war over Gen. Augusto
Pinochet, Amnesty International acknowledged Tuesday that a judge
who ruled that the former Chilean dictator does not have immunity
from arrest is the director of its charitable foundation.
	   With emotions rising over whether Britain will extradite
Pinochet to Spain to face charges of genocide and torture, widows
of Chilean policemen killed by ``Marxist terrorists'' chanted
outside Prime Minister Tony Blair's Downing Street office,
demanding the release of the 83-year-old general.
	   Amnesty International announced a mass laying of white flowers
in London on Thursday for the victims of Pinochet's 1973-90 rule _
and said that South African-born Lord Justice Leonard Hoffmann, the
unpaid director of the human rights group's fundraising arm, had
nothing to do with its long campaign to have Pinochet brought to
trial.
	   The controversy erupted as Friday's deadline neared for Home
Secretary Jack Straw to decide whether extradition proceedings can
go ahead following the 3-2 ruling Nov. 25 against Pinochet by five
judges of Britain's highest court, the House of Lords.
	   Pinochet, not seen in public since his Oct. 16 arrest on a
Spanish warrant, awaited the verdict under police guard in a rented
mansion at Wentworth, 20 miles (30 kms) west of London.
	   Shouting ``take your hands out of Chile,'' a group of some 90
supporters handed in a petition at Blair's office.
	   ``We are widows of members of the armed forces and policemen
that were killed in terrorist attacks by Marxist terrorist groups
in Chile,'' said Veronica Vallejos who handed in a letter on behalf
of 700 families urging the government to send Pinochet home. ``We
want reconciliation in Chile.''
	   Pinochet supporters are arriving from Chile for the Straw
verdict. Most demonstrations up to now have been by Chilean exiles
who fled Pinochet's right-wing rule.
	   A Chilean government report says 3,197 people were murdered or
disappeared at the hands of the secret police after Pinochet
overthrew Salvador Allende, an elected Marxist. But Chile's
government wants him back, partly to avoid exacerbating domestic
tensions, which could threaten the country's newly built democracy.
	   Amnesty International said Hoffmann, 64, an opponent of
apartheid who settled in Britain in the `60s, has served since 1990
as director and chairman of Amnesty International Charity Ltd. His
wife, Gillian, also a liberal South African, is a secretary in
Amnesty International's press office in London.
	   Pinochet supporters were trying to divert attention from the
basic issue of whether he should be tried on heinous charges, said
Amnesty spokeswoman Soraya Bermejo.
	   ``There are many lawyers who have links with human rights
organizations,'' she added.
	   Hoffmann made no comment.
	   Opposition Conservative Party legislators said he should
apologize.
	   ``Surely it is unacceptable for a judge to sit on a case in
which he is connected with an organization, however, admirable,
that is playing a prominent and active part in a case?'' Norman
Lamont, a former Tory Cabinet minister said in a letter to the head
of the judiciary, Lord Derry Irvine.
	   In the Pinochet case, the judges _ in an unusual move _ allowed
lawyers for Amnesty International to make representations.

Iraq to decide in January whether to cooperate with inspectors
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Aziz saying decision on U.N.
inspectors to be made after review in January. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Iraq will decide whether to continue cooperating
with U.N. weapons inspectors only after a comprehensive Security
Council review of Iraq's compliance with U.N. resolutions, Deputy
Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said Tuesday.
	   If the Security Council conducts such a review, diplomats have
said it will not start until January.
	   ``We will make a decision on protecting Iraq's independence and
sovereignty in light of the review,'' Aziz, who is visiting Moscow,
was quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying.
	   Moscow is among those who have called for a comprehensive
review, saying that should help wrap up seven years of U.N. weapons
inspections.
	   Iraq agreed to resume cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors
last month after a confrontation that nearly led to military
strikes by the United States.
	   U.N. weapons monitors began a series of surprise inspections
Tuesday. After the inspections, they will prepare a report for U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
	   He will then report to the Security Council, which must decide
that Iraq is in full cooperation with inspectors before it will
undertake a comprehensive review of Iraq's compliance with U.N.
resolutions.
	   Aziz, meeting with teachers and students at Moscow's Institute
of International Relations on Tuesday, stressed the two countries
have strong economic, political and cultural ties.
	   ``We have common objectives and common interests,'' Aziz said,
according to the ITAR-Tass news agency. ``Let us preserve, expand,
and strengthen them.''
	   Russian oil companies bought more than one-third of the oil that
Iraq sold over the past six months under its oil-for-food program
with the United Nations, a news report said Tuesday.
	   The purchases by the 13 Russian oil companies, including
powerhouses Sidanko and Lukoil, totaled 107 million barrels worth
dlrs 1.25 billion, or 35 percent of all Iraqi oil sold abroad, the
Interfax news agency said.
	   Iraq is under comprehensive U.N. sanctions, but is allowed to
export limited quantities of oil to buy food and medicine.
	   Russia is one of the world's largest oil producers and
exporters. But its oil companies have been buying Iraqi oil because
they want to maintain close ties and hope to rebuilding Iraq's oil
industry when United Nations sanctions are lifted.
	   However, the United States continues to support sanctions
against Iraq and says the Arab nation continues to conceal its
weapons program from U.N. inspectors.
	   The sanctions, imposed in response to Iraq's 1990 invasion of
Kuwait, are to remain until the inspectors certify that Iraq has
dismantled its program for making weapons of mass destruction.

 &UR; NATO ministers say both sides fail to comply in Kosovo
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Albright quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright blasted both Serbs and ethnic Albanians in Kosovo Tuesday,
saying their inflammatory public statements do not help the cause
of peace.
	   The secretary of state also warned Serb authorities that NATO
``remains ready to act if necessary'' in Kosovo to stop continuing
violence.
	   ``We have told both parties to the conflict time and again that
there is no military solution,'' Albright told a news conference.
	   Earlier, NATO's 16 foreign ministers issued a statement
deploring the continuing violence and also blamed both sides.
	   ``The security situation in Kosovo remains of great concern to
us,'' the ministers said. ``Since the beginning of November,
violent incidents provoked in some cases by Serbian security forces
and in others by armed Kosovar elements have increased tension.
These incidents show that both the Belgrade authorities and the
armed Kosovar elements have failed to comply fully with the
requirements set on in U.N. Security Council resolutions.''
	   Hundreds of people, mostly civilians, died and hundreds of
thousands were driven from their homes in seven months of fighting
between the Serb police and armed forces and the rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army.
	   Serbia, the dominant republic in what is left of the Yugoslav
federation, withdrew Kosovo's autonomy in 1989. The ethnic Albanian
majority is now demanding independence, something the Belgrade
authorities have rejected.
	   The fighting was halted and a shaky cease-fire installed only
after NATO threatened to conduct air strikes.
	   ``Both Serb and Albanian leaders have made public satements that
do not help the cause of peace,'' Albright said. ``Serb threats to
launch a renewed offensive in Kosovo are dangerous and we view them
with extreme seriousness.
	   ``I want to remind the Serb leadership that NATO remains ready
to act if necessary. On the other hand, Kosovo Albanian insistance
on rhetoric of independence and rejection of the Contact Group's
draft agreement do have help us to move forward.''
	   The ministers insisted in their joint declaration that both
sides stick to the cease-fire.
	   ``We also expect them to facilitate the war crimes
investigations by the International Tribunal for the former
Yugoslavia (ICTY). In this connection, we deplore the denial of
visas to ICTY investigators.''
	   The ministers urged all parties ``to move rapidly in a spirit of
compromise and accommodation to conclude the negotiating process.''
	   That process is being mediated by Christopher Hill, the American
ambassador to Macedonia.
	   ``We reaffirm our support for a political solution which
provides an enhanced status for Kosovo, a substantially greater
degree of autonomy and meaningful self-administration, and which
preserves the territorial integrity of (Yugoslavia), and safeguards
the human and civil rights of all inhabitants of Kosovo, whatever
their ethnic origin,'' the statement said.
	   The ministers also condemned recent actions by Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic to suppress the independent media in
Serbia.
	   The alliance said it would continue its air verification
mission, flying surveillance missions over the province, and
pledged its full cooperation to the civilian cease-fire
``verifiers'' under the direction of the 54-nation Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Who is the greatest boxer of all time?
	   For George Foreman, it was Joe Louis _ not Muhammad Ali.
	   ``There's never been a boxer better than Joe Louis,'' Foreman
said Tuesday in a BBC radio interview.
	   ``You'd take one shot from him and you were sure he'd have seven
or eight more coming for you. Certainly Muhammad Ali was the
greatest man ever to fight, but not the greatest boxer.''

Kosovo rebels reject U.S. peace draft
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to INCORPORATE Albright statement in Brussels &QL; 
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbs and ethnic Albanians joined
Tuesday in rejecting the latest U.S. plan for Kosovo, despite a
NATO appeal for the two sides to show a spirit of compromise in the
search for peace in the embattled province.
	   Ratko Markovic, head of Serbian government team for talks with
ethnic Albanians, said the U.S. draft would require
``reconstructing the whole of Yugoslavia'' and would pave the way
for independence for the majority Albanian province.
	   On Monday, the chief ethnic Albanian negotiator, Fehmi Agani,
rebuffed the plan, saying it made too many concessions toward the
Serbs.
	   On Tuesday, Adem Demaci, chief spokesman of the rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army, joined in criticizing the plan, drafted by
American envoy Christopher Hill. Demaci suggested Hill was biased
and should be replaced.
	   ``Mr. Hill either doesn't understand the Albanian problems, or
he is leaning toward the Serbs,'' Demaci said. ``The State
Department should reconsider the results of his work ... (and) send
us more qualified people.''
	   Although the KLA is not a party to the deliberations, its
support is considered critical to the ensuring that any future plan
actually brings peace to the province, where ethnic Albanians
outnumber Serbs 9-to-one.
	   Kosovo is a province in Serbia, the dominant republic in
Yugoslavia.
	   Hundreds of people were killed and almost 300,000 ethnic
Albanians forced from their homes in a seven-month crackdown on
separatists by Serbian forces before an October peace accord.
	   The October accord, reached under threat of NATO airstrikes, was
seen as a way to buy time to allow diplomacy to find a solution
acceptable to both Serbs and ethnic Albanians.
	   But with little sign of diplomatic progress, fears are mounting
that fullscale fighting could erupt, perhaps in the spring, when
snows will melt along the mountain passes to Albania, where the
rebels maintain sanctuaries.
	   In Brussels, Belgium, NATO foreign ministers endorsed U.S.
diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis and called on Serbs and
ethnic Albanians to ``move rapidly in a spirit of compromise and
accommodation.''
	   The ministers also reaffirmed that any settlement must respect
the territorial integrity of Yugoslavia, putting them at odds with
the ethnic Albanians who are seeking independence for the majority
Albanian province.
	   The Americans and Europeans fear independence would lead to
similar demands by other ethnic Albanian communities elsewhere in
the southern Balkans.
	   In rejecting the Hill plan, Demaci acknowledged that the KLA was
using lull in the fighting to rearm and prepare for more battles
with government troops.
	   ``The KLA has no illusion that the (Serb) regime will
democratize overnight and that it will give up trying to find a
solution through force for the Kosovo crisis,'' he said. ``It would
be dangerous if the Albanians don't continue arming themselves and
preparing for resistance.''
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who was attending the
NATO meeting, blasted the Kosovo Albanians' ``rhetoric of
independence'' which she said did not ``help us to move forward.''
	   She also warned the Serb leadership that the Western alliance
was ``ready to act if necessary'' to preserve the shaky cease-fire.
	   In a statement issued in Brussels, NATO foreign ministers
deplored the violence in Kosovo, blaming both Serbs and ethnic
Albanians.
	   ``Since the beginning of November, violent incidents provoked in
some cases by Serbian security forces and in others by armed
Kosovar elements have increased tension,'' the ministers said.
``(Both sides) have failed to comply fully with the requirements
set on in U.N. Security Council resolutions.''
	   The NATO ministers reaffirmed their support for a political
solution ``which provides an enhanced status for Kosovo, a
substantially greater degree of autonomy and meaningful
self-administration'' but which ``preserves the territorial
integrity'' of Yugoslavia.
	   The U.S.-based Human Rights Watch, meanwhile, claimed Tuesday
that more than 1,000 Kosovo Albanians are being held in Serbian
prisons and police stations, and said at least five have died from
beatings and torture.
	   The statement, faxed to The Associated Press bureau in Belgrade,
said hundreds of others have been injured from beatings and
torture.

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Poland's visiting Economics Minister Janusz
Steinhoff held talks with Ukrainian officials Tuesday on joint coal
mining and oil projects.
	   Steinhoff, accompanied by a large delegation of executives from
Polish companies, met with Ukraine's Foreign Trade Minister Serhiy
Osyka, the ministry said.
	   They focused on Ukrainian coal exports to Poland and Polish
supplies of coke and coal mining equipment to Ukraine, it said.
	   The Polish delegation also proposed a joint project for refining
oil at two Ukrainian plants and setting up a series of gas stations
across Ukraine, it said.
	   Steinhoff also met Tuesday with Coal Industry Minister Serhiy
Tulub, exchanging views on the two countries' experience of
restructuring their socialist-era coal industries, the independent
UNIAN news agency said.
	   It cited the Coal Ministry as saying the sides were particularly
interested in the social problems caused by closing loss-making
mines.

Seven Casino cyclists questioned by police
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with report from French research center

<TEXT>
	   LYON, France (AP) _ French authorities are extending their
interrogation of the seven cyclists from the Casino cycling team
being investigated as part of a doping scandal that plagued the
Tour de France, judicial officials said Tuesday.
	   Meanwhile, a report published by a top French research center
said that blood tests are the only reliable method of detecting the
use of banned drugs in sports.
	   The Casino cyclists, who were not identified, had been expected
to be released Tuesday, after 24 hours of questioning.
	   But authorities ordered them to remain at Lyon police
headquarters, the officials said on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   Police from Lille, where judge Patrick Keil is investigating
doping at the disgraced Festina team, traveled to Lyon to question
the cyclists.
	   During the Tour, Casino cyclist Rodolfo Massi was put under
formal investigation, one stage short of being charged, for
breaking French anti-doping laws.
	   The report, ``Doping in Sports,'' was released by the National
Center of Scientific Research.
	   It argued that banned drugs in common use, such as growth
hormones and erythropoietin (EPO), are generally undetectable using
non-blood tests, such as urine samples.
	   ``Today there is not another valid method to allow the
screening'' of banned substances, said Dr. Gerard Dine, who worked
on the report.
	   But blood tests remain underused because of ethical concerns,
the center said.
	   The report recommended forming a think-tank to analyze future
doping substances, and special training for doctors to help them
track the use of drugs in sports.
	   It also said that in 1997, of 3,905 athletes tested in France,
123 were found to have taken banned substances, a rate of 3.15
percent.
	   French lawmakers are debating a tough new anti-doping law in the
aftermath of the scandal-plagued Tour de France.

Iran reportedly recruiting ex-Soviet bio weapons experts
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Russian Foreign and Defense Ministries
declining comment; ADDs background &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Iran has recruited ex-Soviet germ warfare
scientists for jobs in Tehran, with at least some of them being
asked to work on a clandestine biological weapons program, The New
York Times reported Tuesday.
	   Officials with ties to Iran's top leadership have approached
more than a dozen Russian biological warfare experts with high
salary offers, the Times said, quoting Russian scientists and U.S.
officials.
	   Though most of the biologists declined the offer, at least five
had accepted as much as dlrs 5,000 a month to work in Iran, far
more than most could make in a year in Russia, the report said,
citing Russian scientists.
	   The counselor to Iran's mission to the United Nations,
Gholamhossein Dehghani, ``categorically rejected'' the claim that
Iran is seeking to hire Russian germ warfare experts, the Times
said.
	   He cited his country's ratification of the 1972 international
treaty banning biological weapons.
	   The Russian Foreign and Defense Ministries would not comment on
the report. Analysts at the PIR-Center for Policy Studies, a think
tank that focuses on exports of military technology and
proliferation, said they would not comment on the report until
Wednesday.
	   Largely under U.S. pressure, Russian President Boris Yeltsin
signed a decree in January that would prevent the export of
so-called dual-use technologies that can be used to build missiles,
nuclear, biological and chemical weapons.
	   The Defense Ministry has insisted that it hasn't sold Iran any
technology or provided any expertise that would help it make
nuclear weapons. But the ministry has said it would continue
selling sanctioned technology abroad, particularly conventional
arms.
	   Iranian scientists have studied at Russian universities in
recent years, but university officials insist they were taught only
Russian language and basic science and engineering courses.
	   In interviews conducted by the Times in Russia and neighboring
Kazakstan, two scientists told the Times that they were
specifically asked to help Iran develop biological weapons.
	   American officials say many more Russian scientists have
disclosed such contacts and believe that Iran is developing a germ
arsenal, the Times said.
	   Officials who worked in the once-secret Soviet and U.S. germ
warfare programs were quoted as saying that it is difficult to
distinguish between pharmaceutical research and weapons
development.
	   Russia's program, which is thought to have developed anthrax and
smallpox weapons, employed some 70,000 scientists and technicians
at its height.

Annan describes his visit to Libya as very positive on Lockerbie
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Tuesday
described his visit last week to Libya as ``very positive'' in
efforts to arrange a trial for the two suspects in the Lockerbie
bombing.
	   Annan met with Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi Saturday in a new
effort to try to persuade him to hand over the suspects, Abdel
Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah.
	   The U.N. chief told a news conference in Paris that ``the
Libyans must take a decision ... I hope they will do it, but you
never know.''
	   He said the Libyan leadership had work to do to prepare the
country for news of an eventual handover of the suspects, a move
which could arouse popular opposition.
	   The New York-bound Pan Am Flight 103 exploded over the Scottish
town of Lockerbie on Dec. 21, 1988, killing 270 people.
	   Libya is now considering a U.S-British proposal for Scottish
judges to try the men at a special court in the Netherlands.

U.N. intensifies hunt for Iraq's illegal arms
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs; UPDATES with U.N. carrying out intensive searches
Tuesday; Aziz comments; EDITS to conform; CHANGES byline, overline &QL; 
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The United Nations on Tuesday launched an
intensive search for Iraq's illegal weapons amid Iraqi charges that
its arms inspectors are again trying to harass Baghdad.
	   ``We are undertaking a very intensive schedule,'' Caroline
Cross, the inspectors' spokeswoman in Baghdad, told The Associated
Press. ``We have several teams in town. We need to test Iraq's
pledge to comply.''
	   Baghdad did not hide its anger as the weapons inspectors speeded
up their probe. State-run newspapers quoted Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz, currently on a visit to Moscow, as saying that there is
a limit to Iraqi compliance.
	   They quoted him as saying that Iraq has been cooperating with
the U.N. inspectors for more than seven years but is yet to see an
end to economic sanctions.
	   ``This situation is no longer acceptable,'' Aziz was quoted as
saying.
	   The sanctions, imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait,
cannot be lifted until the weapons inspectors certify that Iraq is
free of weapons of chemical and biological weapons and long-range
missiles.
	   Late Monday, Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf said a
team of 39 inspectors has arrived in Iraq, and branded them
``commandos'' trying to create problems. But Ms. Cross, the
inspectors' spokeswoman, denied a new team had come.
	   ``There is no reason for the Iraqis to worry if they are going
to comply,'' she said.
	   There are now about 140 weapons experts in Iraq's U.N. arms
control and monitoring inspectorate in addition ``to several
visiting teams,'' she said.
	   The inspectors resumed their work last month after a nearly
three-month hiatus during which Iraq had banned them from visiting
any new suspected weapons sites. Iraq allowed them back and pledged
full cooperation as the United States and Britain were preparing to
launch military strikes on Nov. 14.
	   On Tuesday, at least nine U.N. vans went into the field. Chief
U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler had earlier said that a
series of surprise visits would begin Tuesday in a final test of
Baghdad's pledge of cooperation.
	   He said the surprise inspections will finish late this week or
early next week. After that he would report to U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan whether Iraq is making good on its
promise to cooperate.
	   Annan then will report to the U.N. Security Council, which must
decide whether there is room for starting a comprehensive review of
Iraq's compliance with U.N. resolutions.
	   Iraq hopes that the review will lead to lifting the sanctions _
a move that the United States and Britain have not been willing to
guarantee.

Britain sets up compensation fund for Nazi victims
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Mandelson's announcement; ADDS quotes and
information throughout &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The government will establish a 25 million pound
(dlrs 40 million) fund to compensate Nazis' victims whose assets
were seized by Britain during World War II, Trade and Industry
Secretary Peter Mandelson said Tuesday.
	   Any victims of Nazi persecution who had assets in the Britain
confiscated by the government under the 1939 Trading with the Enemy
Act can make a claim, which will be considered by a panel of three
independent assessors, Mandelson said.
	   Claims will be paid at today's values to the original owners or
their heirs.
	   ``This government is aware that time is of the essence to
victims of Nazi persecution and their families,'' Mandelson said.
``We shall therefore establish the claims scheme as a matter of
urgency so that claims for compensation may be met as soon as
possible.''
	   Property from Nazis' victims was seized under the act which was
intended to stop ``belligerent countries'' using property belonging
to their nationals to finance Hitler's war effort.
	   However, innocent victims, including many Jews who had sent cash
and valuables to Britain for safekeeping, were also affected by the
act and have not yet received compensation.
	   Rabbi Jonathan Romain, a spokesman for the Reform Synagogues of
Great Britain, welcomed the fund's creation, saying it was a
``long-overdue rectification of a 55-year-old injustice.''
	   The government appointed a member of the House of Lords, Lord
Archer, in June to study the compensation issue, and he recommended
the claims fund be established, Mandelson said.
	   Mandelson said he has already received a number of potential
claims. A list of more than 25,000 records of those whose property
was confiscated is listed on the Internet at

Chirac lunches with Dalai Lama despite Beijing's objections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS quotes from dissident Wei Jingsheng &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ President Jacques Chirac came under fire Tuesday
from both the Beijing government and a prominent Chinese dissident,
the first for meeting with the Dalai Lama and the second for
allegedly being soft on human rights.
	   France has sought to avoid friction with China in an effort to
expand commercial ties, and on Tuesday the policy was put to the
test.
	   Chirac lunched at his Elysee Palace with the Dalai Lama despite
China's calls for Paris to cancel the invitation to the Tibetan
spiritual leader.
	   France defended its position _ but also affirmed Tibet should
remain part of China.
	   The exiled leader's visit to Paris, to participate in the 50th
anniversary celebration of the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights, was ``natural,'' the French government said.
	   ``The Dalai Lama is a respected religious figure and respected
by the international community and the French people,'' Foreign
Ministry spokesman Francois Rivasseau told a daily news briefing
before the lunch.
	   ``France has always recognized that Tibet has been part of
China. That position is unchanged,'' he added.
	   Speaking after the luncheon, the Dalai Lama told reporters: ``My
position remains the same. I am trying to promote meaningful
self-rule, not independence, through dialogue.''
	   The Dalai Lama added that he is optimistic about the future.
``China is in the process of changing,'' he said.
	   Earlier Tuesday, Beijing pressed Chirac to drop his lunch plans
with the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize winner, one of a group of Nobel
laureates invited to meet Chirac.
	   Leading Chinese dissident Wei Jingshen also attacked Chirac
Tuesday, saying the French president ``never stops repeating that
the human rights situation has improved and that there's no reason
to press for a resolution condemning the violations.
	   ``It's a wrong position by France, and it's a wrong attitude you
find in other European countries,'' he told France Info radio in
Paris, where like the Dalai Lama, he was present for the rights
declaration anniversary.
	   The Dalai Lama, who fled Tibet in 1959 after a failed uprising
against Chinese rule, has been campaigning for greater autonomy for
the Himalayan region.

DiMaggio improves dramatically
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HOLLYWOOD, Florida (AP) _ American baseball great Joe DiMaggio
has improved dramatically, with his fever gone and his lungs
clearing, his doctor said Tuesday.
	   ``He's remarkably better,'' Dr. Earl Barron told The Associated
Press. ``Don't ask me how or why.''
	   On Monday, Barron said DiMaggio had suffered ``a significant and
serious turn for the worse'' during the weekend in his battle back
from lung cancer surgery and that the 84-year-old U.S. Baseball
Hall of Famer was ``not in good shape.''
	   Doctors inserted a tube into DiMaggio's trachea on Monday to
suction out the infected material.
	   ``He perked up immediately,'' Barron said.
	   ``His white blood count is down and the fever was gone last
evening,'' Barron said. ``We've been able to lighten up a bit on
his medication. He is significantly better.''
	   Barron denied a broadcast report that DiMaggio had lapsed into a
coma.
	   ``His level of consciousness has been down because he was
sedated. But he is not in a coma. He is up and moving and opening
his eyes,'' Barron said.
	   DiMaggio has been hospitalized since Oct. 12, with Barron
heading a team of six doctors treating him. DiMaggio underwent
surgery for removal of a tumor from his lung Oct. 14, and his
recovery has been difficult.
	   His condition deteriorated dramatically during the weekend.

Kabila says no elections in Congo until Rwanda, Uganda withdraw
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ President Laurent Kabila said Tuesday
that Congo won't hold elections until Ugandan and Rwandan soldiers
withdraw from his country, appearing to back away from pledges to
hold a presidential vote in April.
	   ``The possibility of elections is linked to the withdrawal of
the soldiers of aggression that are occupying our territory,''
Kabila said at a press conference. ``One can't have elections in a
divided country.''
	   Kabila had earlier promised to hold the elections in April.
	   Last month, during a summit in Paris, the leaders of Rwanda,
Uganda, Zimbabwe and Congo made a commitment to end the war and to
sign a cease-fire agreement.
	   They are expected to sign it Dec. 14-15 in Lusaka, Zambia.
	   Congo rebels, who didn't participate in the Paris talks and
initially reacted negatively to the outcome, are talking to Ugandan
President Yoweri Museveni about how they could be a part of the
cease-fire, a U.N. official said recently.
	   Rwandan officials have said, however, that they will keep troops
in neighboring Congo until security along its border is guaranteed.
	   The rebels are trying to overthrow Kabila, who came to power in
May 1997 after toppling longtime Zairian dictator Mobutu Sese Seko.
He promised reform and democracy in his renamed Democratic Republic
of Congo, but many critics say his regime's 18 months in power has
produced repressive policies and a growing intolerance of
criticism.

Sudan bombs southern town where hospital is run by aid agency
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The Sudanese air force bombed a southern
Sudan town, targeting a hospital operated by a Norwegian aid agency
but causing no injuries or damage, the agency said Tuesday.
	   A lone plane dropped six bombs on Chuckudum, about 25 miles (40
kilometers) north of Uganda's border, said Dan Eiffie, a spokesman
for Norwegian People's Aid, which runs the hospital.
	   ``These bombing incidents seem to follow a pattern of targeting
important institutions such as hospitals,'' Eiffie said, adding
that the agency's four hospitals in south Sudan had been targeted
in the past.
	   Two Norwegians and an Irish visitor witnessed Monday's raid,
Effie said. There was no official confirmation of the attack.
	   Effie said Chuckudum has no bases for the Sudan People's
Liberation Army, the main southern rebel group that has been
fighting the Khartoum government for over 12 years.

Havel receives former Vienna Mayor to express his regret over spy
</HEADLINE>
allegation &QL; 
 &UR; By NADIA RYBAROVA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Czech President Vaclav Havel
received the former mayor of Vienna on Tuesday to express his
regrets over an allegation that the prominent Austrian spied for
the former communist secret police.
	   ``It was a very friendly meeting and I did not even hope it
would be so nice,'' Helmut Zilk said after the 30-minute meeting in
Havel's villa.
	   Zilk refused to provide details, saying he would hold a news
conference on Wednesday. Havel's spokesman, Ladislav Spacek, said
that both men consider the affair closed by the meeting.
	   ``The president apologized to Mr. Zilk for the share of guilt
his office was bearing in this affair,'' Spacek said.
	   Zilk was to receive a high state decoration Oct. 28 in a
ceremony marking the 80th anniversary of the founding of the
Czechoslovak Republic in 1918.
	   But Havel withdrew the honor just three days before the ceremony
after a source claimed that Zilk spied for the Czech communist
secret service and provided information that led to several
convictions.
	   Originally, Ivan Medek, the head of Havel's office, called the
information ``absolutely reliable.''
	   But the decision to withdraw the decoration provoked strong
criticism among Czech politicians, who said it damaged
Czech-Austrian relations. They accused Havel and his staff of
acting unprofessionally.
	   ``The president thinks that there may have been other ways how
to handle the problem, but it's hard to say which of them would ...
prevent these unfortunate consequences,'' Spacek said.
	   Last week, Foreign Minister Jan Kavan presented a formal regret
to Austrian Ambassador Peter Niesner, after Czech Ambassador Jiri
Grusa said in Vienna that the charges were ``irrelevant.''
	   Grusa said he based his comments on the findings of a special
Interior Ministry commission set up to examine the spy allegations.
	   ``I consider that an apology,'' Zilk said earlier Tuesday after
meeting with parliamentary speaker Vaclav Klaus.
	   Interior Minister Vaclav Grulich was quoted as saying that from
the files available, it is impossible to say whether Zilk was an
agent. Sen. Vaclav Benda, once director of an institute
investigating crimes of the former communist regime, maintains
there was evidence that Zilk worked for the Czechoslovak secret
police, or STB.
	   He repeated on the private NOVA television late Monday that Zilk
became STB agent in January, 1968, and had been receiving money for
the information he supplied.
	   ``There's definitely nothing I should apologize for to Mr.
Zilk,'' Benda said.

	   CHITTAGONG, Bangladesh (AP) _ A speeding truck driving past a
railroad crossing hit the last car of a passenger train in the
southern port city of Chittagong Tuesday, a local official said. At
least 30 university students were injured.
	   Twenty students were admitted in serious condition in a local
hospital, he said. The others were released after first aid.
	   Chittagong is 216 km (135 miles) southeast of the capital Dhaka.
The train runs between the city and Chittagong university 18 km (11
miles) from the city's main district.
	   The driver of the truck escaped unhurt and fled. Angry students
attacked and damaged 15 vehicles in the area after the accident,
the official said.

NATO appeal for the two sides to show a spirit of compromise in the
search for peace in the embattled province.
	   Ratko Markovic, head of Serbian government team for talks with
ethnic Albanians, said the U.S. draft would require
``reconstructing the whole of Yugoslavia'' and would pave the way
for independence for the majority ethnic Albanian province.
	   On Monday, the chief ethnic Albanian negotiator, Fehmi Agani,
rebuffed the plan, saying it made too many concessions to the
Serbs.
	   On Tuesday, Adem Demaci, chief spokesman of the rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army, joined in criticizing the plan, drafted by U.S.
envoy Christopher Hill. Demaci suggested Hill was biased and should
be replaced.
	   ``Mr. Hill either doesn't understand the Albanian problems, or
he is leaning toward the Serbs,'' Demaci said. ``The State
Department should reconsider the results of his work ... (and) send
us more qualified people.''
	   Although the KLA is not a party to the deliberations, its
support is considered critical to ensuring that any future plan
actually brings peace to the province, where ethnic Albanians
outnumber Serbs 9-to-1.
	   Kosovo is a province in Serbia, the dominant republic in
Yugoslavia.
	   Hundreds of people were killed and almost 300,000 ethnic
Albanians forced from their homes in a seven-month crackdown on
separatists by Serbian forces before an October peace accord.
	   The accord, reached under threat of NATO airstrikes, was seen as
a way to buy time for a diplomatic solution acceptable to both
Serbs and ethnic Albanians. But with little sign of progress, fears
are mounting that full-scale fighting could erupt, perhaps in the
spring, when snows will melt along the mountain passes to Albania,
where the rebels maintain sanctuaries.
	   In Brussels, Belgium, NATO foreign ministers endorsed U.S.
diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis and called on Serbs and
ethnic Albanians to ``move rapidly in a spirit of compromise and
accommodation.''
	   The ministers endorsed a plan that would give Kosovo ``a
substantially greater degree of autonomy and meaningful
self-administration'' but said any settlement must respect the
territorial integrity of Yugoslavia _ putting them at odds with
ethnic Albanians seeking independence.
	   The Americans and Europeans fear independence would lead to
similar demands by other ethnic Albanian communities elsewhere in
the southern Balkans.
	   In rejecting the Hill plan, Demaci acknowledged that the KLA was
using lull in the fighting to rearm and prepare for more battles
with government troops.
	   ``The KLA has no illusion that the (Serb) regime will
democratize overnight and that it will give up trying to find a
solution through force for the Kosovo crisis,'' he said. ``It would
be dangerous if the Albanians don't continue arming themselves and
preparing for resistance.''
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who was attending
the NATO meeting, criticized the Kosovo Albanians' ``rhetoric of
independence,'' which she said did not ``help us to move forward.''
	   She also warned the Serb leadership that the Western alliance
was ``ready to act if necessary'' to preserve the shaky cease-fire.
	   In a statement issued in Brussels, NATO foreign ministers
deplored the violence in Kosovo, blaming both Serbs and ethnic
Albanians.
	   ``Since the beginning of November, violent incidents provoked in
some cases by Serbian security forces and in others by armed
Kosovar elements have increased tension,'' the ministers said.
``(Both sides) have failed to comply fully with the requirements
set on in U.N. Security Council resolutions.''
	   The U.S.-based Human Rights Watch, meanwhile, claimed Tuesday
that more than 1,000 Kosovo Albanians are being held in Serbian
prisons and police stations, and said at least five have died from
beatings and torture.
	   The statement, faxed to The Associated Press in Belgrade, said
hundreds of others have been injured from beatings and torture.

Belarusian journalists receives press freedom award

	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ A Belarusian journalist received a press
freedom award in Minsk on Tuesday from the Committee to Protect
Journalists, after the government barred him from traveling to New
York to accept the honor.
	   Officials with the New York-based CPJ, including director Ann
Cooper, flew to Belarus to give Pavel Sheremet the International
Press Freedom Award in person.
	   ``We came here to show our personal support and solidarity with
Pavel Sheremet and all Belarusian journalists who continue to
perform their professional duties in such difficult conditions,''
said Chrystina Lapychak, program coordinator for Eastern Europe.
	   Sheremet, Minsk bureau chief for Russia's ORT television and
chief editor of the newspaper Belarusskaya Delovaya Gazeta, was
selected ``for his great courage and ability to defend his rights
despite constant persecution,'' she said.
	   Sheremet has endured arrest and imprisonment while covering the
increasingly strict government in this former Soviet republic.
	   Belarus' visa department refused him an exit visa to attend the
Nov. 24 CPJ award ceremony in New York, citing orders from the
administration of President Alexander Lukashenko.
	   Belarusian citizens still need an exit visa to leave the
country, a practice left over from Soviet times that has been
abolished in most other former Soviet republics.
	   ``A couple of years ago fear prevented us from struggling for a
normal, human life,'' Sheremet said in his acceptance speech in
Minsk's central Hotel Yubileinaya.
	   ``Belarus is viewed in the world as a country of dictatorship
... but I am sure that in several years Belarus will be viewed as a
normal country, where nobody will be able to impose on the people
the (Soviet-style) system the entire world has already abandoned.''
	   Lukashenko has ranked among the top ten world leaders
suppressing independent media in CPJ polls for the past three
years, Cooper said.
	   Lukashenko has frequently complained about Russian news coverage
of his country, and has claimed on several occasions that Sheremet
and other journalists were trying to harm the image of Belarus.
	   Despite protests by Russian President Boris Yeltsin and human
rights activists, Belarusian authorities held Sheremet in jail for
2 1/2 months and then gave him a two-year suspended sentence for a
report on Belarus' lax border controls.

The new NATO must go beyond its immediate borders
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Albright quotes on nuclear issue &QL; 
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright said Tuesday NATO must be prepared to take action beyond
its borders and that suggestions this amounts to creating a new
``global NATO'' are ``hogwash.''
	   ``We are neither altering the North Atlantic Treaty nor
attempting to create some kind of a new `global NATO,''' she said.
``What we are doing is using the flexibility the treaty always
offered to adapt this alliance to the realities of a new strategic
environment...''
	   Albright was speaking to fellow NATO foreign ministers, gathered
here to discuss the major issues that will be presented to the
16-nation alliance's summit April 24-25 in Washington. Also
attending were ministers from Poland, Hungary and the Czech
Republic, which will become members next year.
	   One of the main summit issues will be updating NATO's strategic
concept, the military and political principles that define its
mission. In practice, that means updating theory to reflect what
NATO has been doing for years.
	   With the fall of the Berlin wall and the end of the Warsaw Pact,
the alliance has moved away from its strategy of defending against
a massive tank attack across Central Europe to new challenges such
as regional conflicts, ethnic violence, terrorism and the spread of
weapons of mass destruction.
	   ``We must be prepared because we know that events beyond NATO's
immediate borders can affect vital alliance interests,'' Albright
said. ``This is why we acted in Bosnia. This is why we have come
together to prevent renewed violence in Kosovo.
	   ``Common sense tells us that it is sometimes better to deal with
instability when it is still at arms length that to wait until it
is at our doorstep.''
	   The central mission of NATO will always be collective defense,
but that doesn't preclude new missions.
	   ``One of the special qualities of the alliance has always been
its ability to react flexibly to new situations,'' said German
Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer. ``On the eve of the 21st century
we should ask ourselves if our instruments still match the changed
security environment.''
	   Albright rejected suggestions by some critics that taking on
these new missions would undermine NATO's original intent. ``I've
said it before; I will repeat it again today: This is hogwash,''
she said.
	   ``A ballistic missile attack using a weapon of mass destruction
from a rogue state is every bit as much a ... threat to our borders
now as a Warsaw Pact tank was two decades ago.''
	   Fischer made waves when he called on NATO last month to consider
dropping its doctrine allowing a nuclear first-strike. This
doctrine, reaffirmed as recently as last year, has always been a
part of NATO's nuclear strategy and is considered an important
aspect of deterrence.
	   The idea, long a plank in the platform of Fischer's Green Party,
doesn't win much support within the alliance, but many are willing
to discuss it.
	   ``Only in a climate of arms reduction can we fight against
weapons of mass destruction,'' Fischer told reporters. ``When we
succeed in reducing the significance of nuclear weapons, then we
will have achieved a lot.''
	   Albright dismissed the suggestion. She said nuclear policy was
reviewed at the end of the Cold War.
	   ``The strategy was changed in 1991 and was reaffirmed as
recently as last year,'' she said at a news conference. ``So we do
not believe a review is necessary. We have the right nuclear
strategy. I think we all felt pretty comfortable with where we
are.''
	   France, another of the alliance's three nuclear powers, also was
unenthusiastic.
	   ``Our country has nothing against arms reduction,'' said French
Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine. ``At the same time, nuclear
deterrents tend to be considered in France as having helped
preserve peace.''
	   The ministers also deplored the continued violence in Kosovo,
where sporadic killings keep puncturing a shaky cease-fire between
Serb security forces and ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent
of the population.
	   NATO forced an end to the fighting with the threat of air
strikes and has dispatched a rapid reaction force to neighboring
Macedonia ready to intervene to protect the 2,000 civilian
cease-fire ``verifiers'' now deploying.
	   ``Kosovo is a critical test not only for NATO, but for Europe's
larger security structure,'' Albright said.
	   A statement from the ministers blamed both the Serb and ethnic
Albanian sides for the violence.
	   The ministers also agreed that the NATO-led multinational
peacekeeping force in Bosnia should be left at its current
32,000-troop level. A final decision will be made by defense
ministers at their meeting next week.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The FBI opened its Frank Sinatra files
Tuesday, releasing more than 1,200 pages of documents touching on
his unproved allegations of ties to the Communist Party, and a mug
shot from his 1938 arrest on seduction charges.
	   The documents offered a hodgepodge of facts, allegations and
rumors about Sinatra _ from an unfounded report that he dodged the
draft to any number of threatening letters to the singer.
	   According to the FBI, Sinatra had already seen the material
after filing his own request in 1979 and 1980. The FBI came up with
1,300 pages of information on Sinatra, and released all but 25 of
the pages.
	   The papers also indicate that the FBI received information on
Sinatra from the late columnist Walter Winchell. A 1944 Winchell
item about alleged threats to kidnap Sinatra's baby was duly noted.
And Winchell tipped the FBI that same year that Sinatra had paid
dlrs 40,000 for a 4-F draft classification during World War II.
	   An investigation found Winchell's charge was baseless.
	   Another section of the papers included a March 31, 1955, letter
from the agents in charge of the Philadelphia office to FBI
Director J. Edgar Hoover reporting that a confidential informant
``advised that ... Frank Sinatra, well-known radio and movie star,
is a member of the Communist Party.''
	   Another memo from an agent in Detroit said redacted sources had
reported that Sinatra ``was never active in the CP or related front
group activities in the state of Michigan.''
	   Sinatra's mug shot, taken by the Bergen County, New Jersey,
sheriff's office in 1938, was included as well. So was a report
that Sinatra and two business partners _ his friend, Jilly Rizzo,
and reputed mob boss Carlo Gambino _ had lost dlrs 100,000 in a bad
stock deal.
	   Among the other papers on Sinatra: a federal report on the plane
crash that killed Sinatra's mother, Dolly; a report of a 1966 bomb
threat against Sinatra in Miami Beach; and a 1969 death threat in
which Sinatra was given the option of a dlrs 2 million donation to
the Vatican in return for his life.
	   The sender of the last letter was not prosecuted, but turned
over for psychiatric care.
	   The files were released in response to requests by news
organizations under the Freedom of Information Act.

Netanyahu, under siege, achieves symbolic concessions on Clinton

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Agreeing to key symbolic concessions on U.S.
President Bill Clinton's visit to Israel and the Palestinian areas,
the Clinton administration extended a helping hand Tuesday to an
Israeli prime minister under political siege.
	   New clashes erupted in the West Bank as domestic pressure
mounted on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to abandon the Wye
River land-for-security agreement with the Palestinians.
	   The violence and Israel's political turmoil came just five days
before the start of Clinton's visit to Israel and the Palestinian
areas.
	   The trip had been intended to shore up the latest Mideast peace
agreement and restore calm to the region.
	   In one of several bouquets to Netanyahu, Clinton's top envoy to
the region reversed earlier claims and said that the president had
initiated the upcoming visit.
	   ``It was frankly an idea that came up from us, first,'' Dennis
Ross said after an hour-long meeting in Netanyahu's office.
	   Clinton's visit to Palestinian areas is seen by both sides as a
state visit to an entity Israel insists should not achieve
statehood.
	   Earlier U.S. claims that Netanyahu had suggested the visit at
October's Wye talks angered right-wingers in Netanyahu's Cabinet
and helped lead to a vote in parliament on Monday for a
no-confidence motion, to take place in two weeks.
	   The prime minister's perceived equivocations on the peace
process have led legislators from his coalition to say they might
not support him in the no-confidence motion, raising the
possibility of early elections.
	   Netanyahu has spent much of this week scrambling for support
from both his coalition and from opposition parties _ offering
apparently contradictory commitments.
	   Moshe Peled, a legislator in Netanyahu's coalition who opposes
further concessions to the Palestinians, told Channel 2 TV he now
``understood that the government is determined to stop the (peace)
process.''
	   By contrast, a legislator with the Arab Democratic Party said
that he was given assurances that the government would go ahead
with a planned troop withdrawal from the West Bank.
	   ``They will implement it, they will overcome the problems,''
Abdel Wahab Daroushe told Channel 2.
	   In another symbolic concession to Israel, Clinton also decided
to land at the newly opened Gaza airport in a helicopter instead of
in Air Force One, Palestinian and American officials both said.
	   The originally-planned Air Force One landing would have been
seen by both the Palestinians and the Israelis as emphasizing U.S.
support for Palestinian statehood.
	   Ross also appeared to side with Netanyahu's contention that a
recent surge in violence in the West Bank was backed by the
Palestinian Authority.
	   ``If you have differences, the place to deal with differences is
... at the table,'' Ross said. ``Not on the street, there is no
place for violence in this process.'' Ross was schedule to dine
with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat Tuesday evening.
	   A cool reception for Clinton in Israel could have scuttled the
Wye agreement, and damaged Clinton politically.
	   ``When there's difficulties, the President comes and he does all
he can to put things back the way ought to be,'' Ross said.
	   The Palestinian Authority has accused Netanyahu of sparking the
increased violence by reneging on an agreement to release
Palestinians jailed on terror charges.
	   Netanyahu, who released 250 prisoners last month _ most common
criminals _ says he never agreed to release killers.
	   He said that a promised transfer of five percent of the land
from Israeli control to joint jurisdiction next week would be
delayed if the Palestinians did not contain the violence.
	   ``If there will not be fulfillment of obligations, there will be
no withdrawal,'' he said after meeting Ross.
	   Four Palestinian students, an Israeli soldier and a settler
schoolgirl were injured in three separate incidents in the West
Bank on Tuesday.
	   In the Kalandiya refugee camp, hooded high school students
ripped piping off the rooftop of an abandoned building and tossed
it at passing jeeps. Israeli troops fired rubber bullets in
response.

Palestinians: Clinton will land at newly opened Gaza airport
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Israeli comment in graf 5 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Despite Israeli objections, U.S. President Bill
Clinton has decided to touch down at Gaza International Airport,
Palestinian officials said, an act that would boost Palestinian
hopes for statehood.
	   But in a conciliatory gesture towards Israel, Clinton will land
by helicopter and not in Air Force One.
	   The Israelis have complained that a Clinton landing at the newly
opened Palestinian airport in the Gaza Strip would be tantamount to
recognition to an American approval of Palestinian intentions of
independence, something Israel opposes.
	   American officials have said they are leaning towards a
helicopter landing, although they say it is for technical and not
diplomatic reasons.
	   Tuesday, David Bar-Illan, a senior adviser to Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel would not object to a
helicopter landing. ``We don't have any problems with the
president's plans.''
	   Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat called Clinton's land
at the Gaza International Airport on Dec. 14 ``a historical
precedent.'' Clinton arrives Saturday in Jerusalem. His visit was
planned as a celebration of the land-for-security agreement he
helped negotiate but has since been marred by bitter disputes and a
suspension of the talks called by Israel.
	   The Palestinians consider the airport, their first gateway to
the world, a strong symbol of fledgling independence. It opened
last month with great ceremony and cheer after more than two years
of disputes between Israel and the Palestinians over security
arrangements.

Iraq to decide in January whether to cooperate with inspectors
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Aziz saying decision on U.N.
inspectors to be made after review in January. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Iraq will decide whether to continue cooperating
with U.N. weapons inspectors only after a comprehensive Security
Council review of Iraq's compliance with U.N. resolutions, Deputy
Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said Tuesday.
	   If the Security Council conducts such a review, diplomats have
said it will not start until January.
	   ``We will make a decision on protecting Iraq's independence and
sovereignty in light of the review,'' Aziz, who is visiting Moscow,
was quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying.
	   Moscow is among those who have called for a comprehensive
review, saying that should help wrap up seven years of U.N. weapons
inspections.
	   Iraq agreed to resume cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors
last month after a confrontation that nearly led to military
strikes by the United States.
	   U.N. weapons monitors began a series of surprise inspections
Tuesday. After the inspections, they will prepare a report for U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
	   He will then report to the Security Council, which must decide
that Iraq is in full cooperation with inspectors before it will
undertake a comprehensive review of Iraq's compliance with U.N.
resolutions.
	   Aziz, meeting with teachers and students at Moscow's Institute
of International Relations on Tuesday, stressed the two countries
have strong economic, political and cultural ties.
	   ``We have common objectives and common interests,'' Aziz said,
according to the ITAR-Tass news agency. ``Let us preserve, expand,
and strengthen them.''
	   Russian oil companies bought more than one-third of the oil that
Iraq sold over the past six months under its oil-for-food program
with the United Nations, a news report said Tuesday.
	   The purchases by the 13 Russian oil companies, including
powerhouses Sidanko and Lukoil, totaled 107 million barrels worth
dlrs 1.25 billion, or 35 percent of all Iraqi oil sold abroad, the
Interfax news agency said.
	   Iraq is under comprehensive U.N. sanctions, but is allowed to
export limited quantities of oil to buy food and medicine.
	   Russia is one of the world's largest oil producers and
exporters. But its oil companies have been buying Iraqi oil because
they want to maintain close ties and hope to rebuilding Iraq's oil
industry when United Nations sanctions are lifted.
	   However, the United States continues to support sanctions
against Iraq and says the Arab nation continues to conceal its
weapons program from U.N. inspectors.
	   The sanctions, imposed in response to Iraq's 1990 invasion of
Kuwait, are to remain until the inspectors certify that Iraq has
dismantled its program for making weapons of mass destruction.

Noel Coward memorial unveiled as centenary approaches
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Noel Coward, the late English playwright,
songwriter and wit, made his comeback in London's theaterland
Tuesday.
	   Marking the countdown to the centenary of his birth in 1899, the
Queen Mother Elizabeth unveiled a statue of her old friend in the
foyer of one of London's most famed theaters, the Theater Royal in
Drury Lane.
	   Coward, who once said he had a ``talent to amuse,'' died in
Jamaica in 1973 after writing 50 plays, 25 films, hundreds of
songs, a ballet, poems and stories.
	   ``The memory of Noel Coward, his brilliance, his brilliant
composing and playwriting gave immense pleasure to so many people
all over the world,'' the Queen Mother said as she unveiled the
statue. ``But I think we are fortunate to be the legatees of his
lovely music and his light-hearted fun.''
	   During the ceremony, the Queen Mother mouthed the words to one
of Coward's famous songs, ``Mad Dogs and Englishmen.''
	   Next year he will be remembered with a string of events,
including theater revivals of his plays and reissues of some of his
works in print.
	   The satirist was also an actor in films which included ``The
Italian Job'' and wartime propaganda movie, ``In Which We Serve.''
	   He was the author of such songs as ``Don't Put Your Daughter On
The Stage, Mrs. Worthington,'' and ``Mad About The Boy.''
	   He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1970 and late in life,
for health and tax reasons, lived outside England, chiefly in the
Caribbean and Switzerland.

Officials: Heads of four kidnapped foreigners found
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. UPDATES with statement from British foreign office in
grafs 16-7. &QL; 
 &UR; By RUSLAN MUSAYEV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ The severed heads of four kidnapped
foreigners were discovered neatly lined up beside a highway in
Chechnya on Tuesday after a rescue attempt apparently went wrong.
	   The whereabouts of the bodies of the three Britons and a New
Zealander, engineers who had been installing telephone lines across
Chechnya, was unclear.
	   While kidnappings, usually for ransom, have become widespread in
Chechnya since the end of its 1994-96 war for independence from
Russia, hostages are rarely killed _ particularly foreigners. The
gruesome slaying stunned even Chechen officials, and is likely to
aggravate Chechnya's attempts to gain international recognition of
its independence.
	   The deaths were apparently the result of a rescue attempt by
Chechen authorities Monday night that went ``tragically wrong,''
according to Ray Verth, chief executive of Granger Telecom, the
British company the hostages had worked for.
	   Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov said Chechen officials had
caught one of the kidnappers Monday and he told police where the
hostages were being held. But that information reached the other
captors, who decided to kill their captives, the ITAR-Tass news
agency quoted Maskhadov as saying.
	   An Associated Press reporter saw the decapitated heads Tuesday
near the village of Assinovskaya, about 40 kilometers (25 miles)
west of Grozny, the Chechen capital. He did not see any sign of the
bodies.
	   The heads were lined up on a piece of cloth along a main highway
across southern Russia, in plain view of passersby. Two of the
heads had wounds to the temple, possibly gunshot wounds.
	   The victims _ Britons Peter Kennedy, Darren Hickey, and Rudolf
Petschi, and New Zealand's Stanley Shaw _ were identified by Umar
Makhauri, who had been their bodyguard when they were abducted Oct.
3 by unidentified gunmen in Grozny. He said the bodies had not been
found.
	   Maskhadov, however, said in Grozny that the bodies of four men
had been recovered.
	   The heads were taken to the Central Republican Hospital in
Grozny, officials said.
	   Verth said his company had ``opened a dialogue with the
kidnappers and received confirmation that the hostages were alive
as recently as last week.''
	   ``Their murder is an appalling and barbaric act and our thoughts
go out to the families, to whom we offer our deepest condolences.
We are a small tightly-knit company and everyone here is in a state
of shock,'' Verth said Tuesday outside company headquarters in
Weybridge, south of London, where flags were flying at half-mast.
	   Eamon Hickey, the father of one of the missing men, said at his
home in England: ``There is so much rumor and counter-rumor coming
from out there that we don't know what to think. Obviously we are
hoping and praying that it does not turn out to be true.''
	   Russian President Boris Yeltsin expressed outrage at the
killings and urged law enforcement officials to crack down on
kidnapping, presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin told reporters.
	   Yeltsin also warned foreigners to avoid unsanctioned visits to
Chechnya.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said, ``If these reports
(of the slayings) are confirmed, I will be deeply saddened. ... We
will work hard to find out the truth,'' according to a statement
from the Foreign Office in London.
	   ``I strongly repeat our long-standing advice on Chechnya.
British citizens are not safe there and should stay away,'' Cook
said.
	   Maskhadov said the killings were a major blow to Chechnya.
	   ``I am ready to answer before my people and the whole world for
what happened,'' he was quoted as saying by the Interfax news
agency.
	   He blamed the rash of abductions in Chechnya on unidentified
``outside forces'' and their Chechen henchmen.
	   British officials said they had not received any ransom demand
for the missing men.
	   Since the beginning of 1998, 176 people have been kidnapped in
the North Caucasus region of Russia, including dozens of
foreigners, and 90 of them released, officials have said.

	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Armored personnel carriers were
deployed Tuesday around the convention center where U.S. President
Bill Clinton will address 1,500 Palestinian delegates next week.
	   U.S. Secret Service agents have already arrived in Gaza to work
with their Palestinian counterparts on how to protect Clinton
during his first visit to Palestinian areas.
	   ``There is cooperation with the American security people. We
have our own plan. The Americans have their own procedures as
well,'' said the Palestinian police chief, Ghazi Jabali.
	   The Islamic militant group Hamas, which hopes to scuttle the
accord, has been careful not to openly threaten Clinton. However,
Hamas has carried out more than a dozen suicide bombings in Israel
in an attempt to bring peace talks with Israel to a halt.
	   On Monday, Clinton and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat are to
address members of the Palestine National Council and delegates
from other groups, at the Shawa Cultural Center in Gaza City.
	   Traffic near the Shawa Center still flowed normally Tuesday, but
plainclothes security as well as uniformed officers with M-17 and
AK-47 assault rifles began patrolling in the vicinity. Streets
around the center are to be closed days before the Clinton visit.
	   Four armored personnel carriers were parked at the corners of
the convention center, with members of Arafat's elite bodyguard
unit, known as Force 17, sitting on the vehicles.
	   APCs were also deployed outside Arafat's guest house and near
the Palestinian legislative council.
	   Jabali said the APCs were part of a Palestinian security plan
that has been presented to the Americans. U.S. security agents, in
turn, have given their Palestinian counterparts sophisticated
explosives detection equipment.
	   ``The Palestinian police are ready to protect President Clinton
here in Gaza or in Bethlehem,'' Jabali said, referring to Clinton's
expected visit next Tuesday to the Church of the Nativity in the
biblical West Bank town of Bethlehem.
	   ``It is a big responsibility but we are able to shoulder it,''
Jabali said.
	   However, a demonstration of Palestinian prowess for American
officials in Gaza showed off some of the stranger aspects of their
attempts to beef up security.
	   In one show of force, a zucchini quivered on a Palestinian
policeman's bare stomach as another policeman swayed over him just
before slashing the vegetable - but not the policeman - in half.
	   Another demonstration showed a Palestinian policeman completely
befuddled upon encountering a locked door in the car he was
attempting to storm.
	   As part of the security preparations for Clinton's visit to the
West Bank, four American helicopter held landing and departure
exercises at a helipad used by Arafat in the nearby town of Beit
Sahour, as American and Palestinian security officers watched and
co-ordinate hand signals.
	   In Jerusalem, Clinton's entourage of 1,200 people will take over
the Jerusalem Hilton, at a cost of half a million dollars. The
hotel boasts stunning views of Jerusalem's walled Old City and the
slopes of the Judean Desert.

Britain sets up compensation fund for Nazi victims
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS quotes from Jewish group, grafs 8-9 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The government will establish a 25 million pound
(dlrs 40 million) fund to compensate Nazis' victims whose assets
were seized by Britain during World War II, Trade and Industry
Secretary Peter Mandelson said Tuesday.
	   Any victims of Nazi persecution who had assets in the Britain
confiscated by the government under the Trading with the Enemy
legislation of the time can make a claim, which will be considered
by a panel of three independent assessors, Mandelson said.
	   Claims will be paid at today's values to the original owners or
their heirs, he said.
	   ``This government is aware that time is of the essence to
victims of Nazi persecution and their families,'' Mandelson said.
``We shall therefore establish the claims scheme as a matter of
urgency so that claims for compensation may be met as soon as
possible.''
	   Property from Nazis' victims was seized under Britain's 1939
Trading with the Enemy Act, which was intended to stop
``belligerent countries'' using property belonging to their
nationals to finance Hitler's war effort.
	   However, innocent victims, including many Jews who had sent cash
and valuables to Britain for safekeeping, were also affected by the
act and have not yet received compensation.
	   Rabbi Jonathan Romain, a spokesman for the Reform Synagogues of
Great Britain, welcomed the fund's creation, saying it was a
``long-overdue rectification of a 55-year-old injustice.''
	   Neville Nagler, director general of the Board of Deputies of
British Jews called the fund ``a very important step forward.''
	   ``Former governments did not deal fairly with many who came to
Britain as victims and refugees, only to have their assets
confiscated,'' Nagler said. '' It is never too late to recognize
past wrongs.''
	   The government appointed Lord Archer of Sandwell in June to
study the compensation issue, and he recommended the claims fund be
established, Mandelson said.
	   Mandelson said he has already received a number of potential
claims. A list of more than 25,000 records of those whose property
was confiscated is listed on the Internet at
``www.enemyproperty.gov.uk''.

Lyon prevails after 7-goal match to reach quarterfinal of UEFA Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUGGE, Belgium (AP) _ Captain Alain Caveglia scored three goals
Tuesday to earn France's Olympique Lyon a tough 4-3 victory over
Belgian champion FC Brugge and lead his team into the quarterfinals
of the UEFA Cup for the first time in 30 years.
	   Lyon had already beaten FC Brugge 1-0 in the first leg of the
third round two weeks ago. Lyon advanced on a 5-3 aggregate.
	   Forward Caveglia put Lyon on the right track in the 16th minute
when his freekick from the left slipped through the FC Brugge wall
and also through the hands of goalie El-Sayed Nader. The
goalkeeper's blunder put Lyon in an ideal position.
	   By the 55th minute, Brugge was run ragged chasing its opening
goal when Caveglia hooked and weaved his way past defender Tjorven
De Brul twice before beating Nader with an exquisite right-foot
curling shot.
	   FC Brugge had enough pride though to keep on pushing and after a
scrappy goal from De Brul in the 63rd minute, Olivier De Cock
brought a glimmer of hope back to the 14,000 fans at the Breydel
Stadium when he deflected a high cross by playmaker Darco Anic past
Gregory Coupet.
	   But Caveglia refused to let his night be spoiled by the
Belgians. When Lyon countered against an increasingly offensive
Brugge, the captain made space for himself again and tapped in a
simple go-ahead goal that seemed to put the match away for good in
the 71st minute.
	   The Belgian champions never gave up though, and a beautiful
freekick by Anic from 20 meters out put both sides level again in
the 73rd minute.
	   The match though, had turned into a cat and mouse and when
Brugge threw caution to the wind again and depleted its defensive
line, forward Vikash Dhorasoo showed his pace and a cool head to
score Lyon's fourth.
	   It was Lyon's seventh away victory in Europe in its last eight
European rounds.
	   FC Brugge : El-Sayed Nader; Nzelo Lembi, Tjorven De Brul,
Alexandar Ilic, Vital Borkelmans; Olivier De Cock, Franky Van der
Elst, Gert Claesens, Darco Anic; Sven Vermant (46, Khalilou
Fadiga), Edgaras Jankauskas (67, Koen Schockaert).
	   Olympique Lyon : Gregory Coupet; Patrice Carteron; Florent
Laville, Hubert Fournier, Christophe Delmotte, Jacek Bak; Steed
Malbranque, David Linares, Philippe Violeau, Vikash Dhorasoo; Alain
Caveglia (77, Frederic Kanoute).

Russian auto workers kidnap employer to demand wages
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ About 100 women workers at a Siberian auto factory
took their boss hostage to demand their wages, some of which are a
year and a half overdue, a news report said Tuesday.
	   The workers at the Ulan-Ude Auto Factory locked director Leonid
Belykh in his office on Monday and continued to hold him Tuesday,
the Interfax news agency said. It did not say what jobs the women
held.
	   Belykh told the women the wage delays were a result of debts by
the Defense Ministry, which owes the factory 48 million rubles
(dlrs 2.4 million) for back orders. Ulan-Ude is located about 4,400
kilometers (2,700 miles) southeast of Moscow.
	   Russia's cash-strapped government owes workers at state-run
businesses and agencies millions of dollars in back wages.
Employees at hospitals, schools, even nuclear plants have gone on
strike to demand back pay.

U.N. intensifies hunt for Iraq's illegal arms

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The United Nations launched an intensive
search Tuesday for Iraq's illegal weapons amid Iraqi charges that
its arms inspectors are again trying to harass Baghdad.
	   ``We are undertaking a very intensive schedule,'' Caroline
Cross, the inspectors' spokeswoman in Baghdad, told The Associated
Press. ``We have several teams in town. We need to test Iraq's
pledge to comply.''
	   Baghdad did not hide its anger as the weapons inspectors speeded
up their probe. State-run newspapers quoted Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz, currently on a visit to Moscow, as saying that there is
a limit to Iraqi compliance.
	   They quoted him as saying that Iraq has been cooperating with
the U.N. inspectors for more than seven years but is yet to see an
end to economic sanctions.
	   ``This situation is no longer acceptable,'' Aziz was quoted as
saying.
	   The sanctions, imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait,
cannot be lifted until the weapons inspectors certify that Iraq is
free of chemical, nuclear and biological weapons and long-range
missiles.
	   Late Monday, Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf said a
team of 39 inspectors had arrived in Iraq, and branded them
``commandos'' trying to create problems. But Ms. Cross, the
inspectors' spokeswoman, denied a new team had come.
	   ``There is no reason for the Iraqis to worry if they are going
to comply,'' she said.
	   There are now about 140 weapons experts in Iraq in addition ``to
several visiting teams,'' she said.
	   The inspectors resumed their work last month after a nearly
three-month hiatus during which Iraq had banned them from visiting
any new suspected weapons sites. Iraq allowed them back and pledged
full cooperation as the United States and Britain were preparing to
launch military strikes on Nov. 14.
	   On Tuesday, at least nine U.N. vans went into the field. Chief
U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler had earlier said that a
series of surprise visits would begin Tuesday in a final test of
Baghdad's pledge of cooperation.
	   Cross didn't characterize the inspections as ``surprise,''
describing them instead as ``their usual hard work.''
	   Butler said the surprise inspections will finish late this week
or early next week. After that he would report to U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan whether Iraq is making good on its
promise to cooperate.
	   Annan then will report to the U.N. Security Council, which must
decide whether there is enough cooperation to start a comprehensive
review of Iraq's compliance with U.N. resolutions.
	   Iraq hopes that the review will lead to lifting the sanctions _
a move that the United States and Britain have not been willing to
guarantee.

Yeltsin remains hospitalized, out of public view
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With AM-Russia-Grim Forecasts &QL; 
 &UR; By MITCHELL LANDSBERG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin remained out of sight at a
Kremlin hospital Tuesday, leaving Russia's political establishment
to chew over his latest high-profile staff dismissals.
	   ``Yeltsin has broken away from the doctors' watch and again
shown he won't let anyone bury him,'' the liberal daily Segodnya
said, putting the brightest possible spin on the president's
decision to fire several senior aides.
	   Others were less charitable.
	   ``He is not governing anything any longer,'' Communist Party
leader Gennady Zyuganov said. ``This is simply an agony.''
	   Yeltsin, hospitalized since Nov. 22 with pneumonia, emerged
briefly Monday to fire Chief of Staff Valentin Yumashev and three
of his deputies. The president then returned to the hospital.
	   Yeltsin's spokesman said the president fired Yumashev for
failing to stem crime and for reacting too mildly to a Communist
parliament deputy's anti-Semitic remarks. But most people assumed
the aide was axed for speaking too candidly about Yeltsin's
declining health.
	   Yumashev had said Yeltsin was too weak to handle the day-to-day
responsibilities of his job.
	   ``When the presidential inner circle starts speaking about the
boss as if he were a political outsider, you have to replace either
the president or his aides,'' the business daily Kommersant said
Tuesday. ``Yeltsin has chosen the second.''
	   Presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said doctors allowed
Yeltsin to take brief walks around the hospital grounds Tuesday for
the first time since he was hospitalized.
	   ``That means he is on the way to recovery,'' Yakushkin was
quoted as saying by the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Yakushkin said the president was working on documents, but had
no meetings planned and would remain hospitalized as long as
necessary to recuperate.
	   ``Pneumonia is an illness that requires a serious treatment and
a certain regime,'' he said.
	   Yeltsin has been a part-time president for months as his health
has declined. He has played little role in Russia's pressing
economic problems.
	   The Russian economy slumped earlier this year, partly in
response to Asia's economic travails, and plummeted after Aug. 17,
when the government devalued the ruble and temporarily froze
foreign debt payments. Yeltsin, who had heart bypass surgery in
1996, fired almost his entire cabinet as a result of that decision.

GCC official cautions against over-production of oil
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS to UPDATE with al-Hojeilan quotes; changes overline &QL; 
 &UR; By ANWAR FARUQI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ The top official of a
Gulf Arab group on Tuesday cautioned oil rich nations against
over-production, saying it is the root cause of falling world
prices.
	   The plea was made by Jamil al-Hojeilan, the secretary-general of
the Gulf Cooperation Council, in a television interview on the
second day of an annual summit of GCC leaders.
	   This year, the meeting focused on the calamitous effects of low
oil prices on the GCC economies.
	   Al-Hojeilan told the Middle East Broadcasting Corp., an Arabic
TV network, that ``the whole problem'' is caused by countries not
sticking to their production quotas.
	   Analysts say Venezuela, Iran, Indonesia and Qatar are the main
over-producers.
	   ``The strategic view of oil policy in the GCC countries is to
keep a balance between supply and demand. We hope that pledges of
abiding by quotas agreed upon are respected,'' al-Hojeilan said.
	   He denied that GCC oil ministers have agreed to reduce
production.
	   Officials attending the summit made such a claim earlier to The
Associated Press and added that the GCC ministers also agreed to
ask other producers in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries to join them in the cuts starting March.
	   ``It is unfounded. It is wrong,'' al-Hojeilan, a Saudi, told the
MBC interviewer.
	   The GCC comprises Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and
the Emirates. All except Oman and Bahrain are members of OPEC.
	   The Gulf countries, which together sit on half the world's
proven oil reserves and depend on exports for 75 percent of their
revenues, have been hard hit by oil prices that plummeted because
of the recession in Asia and warmer-than-usual winters.
	   On Monday, the opening day of the three-day GCC summit, Saudi
Arabia's Crown Prince Abdullah said that ``the main source of our
income has been greatly shaken by the imbalance of the oil
market.''
	   ``The boom days are gone and will never come back to the
region,'' he said.
	   ``Such an imbalance requires us to exert our utmost efforts
inside and outside OPEC,'' said Abdullah, who is leading the Saudi
delegation in place of his ailing half-brother, King Fahd.
	   The GCC meeting comes less than two weeks after OPEC ministers
adjourned a year-end meeting in the Austrian capital Vienna without
agreeing on measures to halt the slide in oil prices.
	   Instead, the 11-nation cartel decided to review the situation in
March, sending markets into gyrations.
	   Shortly before the GCC meeting began, January futures contracts
for Brent crude _ a widely watched benchmark _ fell to a record low
of dlrs 9.92 a barrel on the International Petroleum Exchange in
London. The contracts closed at dlrs 10.26.
	   Gulf oil generally sells at a dollar or two less than the North
Sea's Brent _ which itself was selling for around dlrs 20 a barrel
as recently as 1997.
	   The Gulf producers have been grappling with widening budget
deficits and problems paying foreign debts. Saudi Arabia, for
example, had projected a dlrs 4.8 billion budget deficit for 1998,
but analysts predict it will reach dlrs 15 billion.
	   ``The projected increases in the GCC budget deficits are
expected to leave a negative impact on their economic
development,'' said Mohammad Khalfan Khirbash, the Emirates
minister of finance.
	   GCC countries were expected to invest up to dlrs 90 billion in
major projects in the next five years, of which dlrs 25 billion was
to go for the oil and gas sectors. Those plans may have to be
scaled down _ or shelved altogether.
	   In the defense sector alone, the Gulf Arab countries have bought
tens of billions of dollars in arms over the past decade. They were
expected to spend another dlrs 80 billion more over the next four
years.

Iran reportedly recruiting ex-Soviet bio weapons experts
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Russian Foreign and Defense Ministries
declining comment; ADDs background &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Iran has recruited ex-Soviet germ warfare
scientists for jobs in Tehran, with at least some of them being
asked to work on a clandestine biological weapons program, The New
York Times reported Tuesday.
	   Officials with ties to Iran's top leadership have approached
more than a dozen Russian biological warfare experts with high
salary offers, the Times said, quoting Russian scientists and U.S.
officials.
	   Though most of the biologists declined the offer, at least five
had accepted as much as dlrs 5,000 a month to work in Iran, far
more than most could make in a year in Russia, the report said,
citing Russian scientists.
	   The counselor to Iran's mission to the United Nations,
Gholamhossein Dehghani, ``categorically rejected'' the claim that
Iran is seeking to hire Russian germ warfare experts, the Times
said.
	   He cited his country's ratification of the 1972 international
treaty banning biological weapons.
	   The Russian Foreign and Defense Ministries would not comment on
the report. Analysts at the PIR-Center for Policy Studies, a think
tank that focuses on exports of military technology and
proliferation, said they would not comment on the report until
Wednesday.
	   Largely under U.S. pressure, Russian President Boris Yeltsin
signed a decree in January that would prevent the export of
so-called dual-use technologies that can be used to build missiles,
nuclear, biological and chemical weapons.
	   The Defense Ministry has insisted that it hasn't sold Iran any
technology or provided any expertise that would help it make
nuclear weapons. But the ministry has said it would continue
selling sanctioned technology abroad, particularly conventional
arms.
	   Iranian scientists have studied at Russian universities in
recent years, but university officials insist they were taught only
Russian language and basic science and engineering courses.
	   In interviews conducted by the Times in Russia and neighboring
Kazakstan, two scientists told the Times that they were
specifically asked to help Iran develop biological weapons.
	   American officials say many more Russian scientists have
disclosed such contacts and believe that Iran is developing a germ
arsenal, the Times said.
	   Officials who worked in the once-secret Soviet and U.S. germ
warfare programs were quoted as saying that it is difficult to
distinguish between pharmaceutical research and weapons
development.
	   Russia's program, which is thought to have developed anthrax and
smallpox weapons, employed some 70,000 scientists and technicians
at its height.

Officials: Heads of four kidnapped foreigners found

<TEXT>
	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ The severed heads of four kidnapped
foreigners were neatly lined up beside a highway in Chechnya on
Tuesday after a rescue attempt apparently went wrong.
	   The whereabouts of the bodies of the three Britons and the New
Zealander, engineers who had been installing telephone lines across
Chechnya, was unclear.
	   While kidnappings, usually for ransom, have become widespread in
Chechnya since the end of its 1994-96 war for independence from
Russia, hostages are rarely killed _ particularly foreigners. The
gruesome slaying stunned even Chechen officials, and is likely to
aggravate Chechnya's attempts to gain international recognition of
its independence.
	   The deaths were apparently the result of a rescue attempt by
Chechen authorities Monday night that went ``tragically wrong,''
according to Ray Verth, chief executive of Granger Telecom, the
British company the hostages had worked for.
	   Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov said Chechen officials had
caught one of the kidnappers Monday and he told police where the
hostages were being held. But that information reached the other
captors, who decided to kill their captives, the ITAR-Tass news
agency quoted Maskhadov as saying.
	   An Associated Press reporter saw the decapitated heads Tuesday
near the village of Assinovskaya, 25 miles west of Grozny, the
Chechen capital. He did not see any sign of the bodies.
	   The heads were lined up on a piece of cloth along a main
highway, in plain view of passers-by.
	   The victims _ Britons Peter Kennedy, Darren Hickey and Rudolf
Petschi, and Stanley Shaw of New Zealand _ were identified by Umar
Makhauri, their bodyguard when they were abducted Oct. 3 in Grozny.
	   Verth said his company had ``opened a dialogue with the
kidnappers and received confirmation that the hostages were alive
as recently as last week.''
	   ``Their murder is an appalling and barbaric act and our thoughts
go out to the families, to whom we offer our deepest condolences.
We are a small tightly knit company and everyone here is in a state
of shock,'' Verth said Tuesday outside company headquarters in
Weybridge, south of London, where flags were flying at half-staff.
	   Russian President Boris Yeltsin expressed outrage at the
killings and urged law enforcement officials to crack down on
kidnapping, presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin told reporters.
	   Maskhadov said the killings were a major blow to Chechnya.
	   ``I am ready to answer before my people and the whole world for
what happened,'' he was quoted as saying by the Interfax news
agency. He blamed the rash of abductions in Chechnya on
unidentified ``outside forces'' and their Chechen henchmen.
	   British officials said they had not received any ransom demand
for the missing men.
	   Since the beginning of 1998, 176 people have been kidnapped in
the North Caucasus region of Russia that includes Chechnya, and 90
of them have been released, according to officials.

Belarusian journalists receives press freedom award

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ A Belarusian journalist received a press
freedom award in Minsk on Tuesday from the Committee to Protect
Journalists, after the government barred him from traveling to New
York to accept the honor.
	   Officials with the New York-based CPJ, including director Ann
Cooper, flew to Belarus to give Pavel Sheremet the International
Press Freedom Award in person.
	   ``We came here to show our personal support and solidarity with
Pavel Sheremet and all Belarusian journalists who continue to
perform their professional duties in such difficult conditions,''
said Chrystina Lapychak, program coordinator for Eastern Europe.
	   Sheremet, Minsk bureau chief for Russia's ORT television and
chief editor of the newspaper Belarusskaya Delovaya Gazeta, was
selected ``for his great courage and ability to defend his rights
despite constant persecution,'' she said.
	   Sheremet has endured arrest and imprisonment while covering the
increasingly strict government in this former Soviet republic.
	   Belarus' visa department refused him an exit visa to attend the
Nov. 24 CPJ award ceremony in New York, citing orders from the
administration of President Alexander Lukashenko.
	   Belarusian citizens still need an exit visa to leave the
country, a practice left over from Soviet times that has been
abolished in most other former Soviet republics.
	   ``A couple of years ago fear prevented us from struggling for a
normal, human life,'' Sheremet said in his acceptance speech in
Minsk's central Hotel Yubileinaya.
	   ``Belarus is viewed in the world as a country of dictatorship
... but I am sure that in several years Belarus will be viewed as a
normal country, where nobody will be able to impose on the people
the (Soviet-style) system the entire world has already abandoned.''
	   Lukashenko has ranked among the top ten world leaders
suppressing independent media in CPJ polls for the past three
years, Cooper said.
	   Lukashenko has frequently complained about Russian news coverage
of his country, and has claimed on several occasions that Sheremet
and other journalists were trying to harm the image of Belarus.
	   Despite protests by Russian President Boris Yeltsin and human
rights activists, Belarusian authorities held Sheremet in jail for
2 1/2 months and then gave him a two-year suspended sentence for a
report on Belarus' lax border controls.

west of Grozny, the Chechen capital. He did not see any sign of the
bodies.
	   The heads were lined up on a piece of cloth along a main highway
across southern Russia, in plain view of passersby. Two of the
heads had wounds to the temple, possibly gunshot wounds.
	   The victims _ Britons Peter Kennedy, Darren Hickey, and Rudolf

Makhauri, who had been their bodyguard when they were abducted Oct.
3 by unidentified gunmen in Grozny. He said the bodies had not been

hoping and praying that it does not turn out to be true.''
	   Russian President Boris Yeltsin expressed outrage at the
killings and urged law enforcement officials to crack down on
kidnapping, presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin told reporters.
	   Yeltsin also warned foreigners to avoid unsanctioned visits to
Chechnya.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said, ``If these reports
(of the slayings) are confirmed, I will be deeply saddened. ... We
will work hard to find out the truth,'' according to a statement
from the Foreign Office in London.
	   ``I strongly repeat our long-standing advice on Chechnya.
British citizens are not safe there and should stay away,'' Cook
said.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Nearly four months after Russia's financial
markets imploded, getting money out of the bank sometimes requires
hopping on a jet.
	   Some foreign companies, unable to establish working accounts in
Russia's convulsed banks, fly executives to Europe to withdraw tens
of thousands of dollars in cash. The nervous businessmen then
hand-carry the money back to Russia in their briefcases.
	   It's a process that often has to be repeated every few weeks.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov's government has brought a
temporary measure of economic stability following this summer's
dramatic crash, which was linked to a broader meltdown that also
wiped out emerging markets in Asia.
	   But with President Boris Yeltsin ailing, there are signs
conditions could worsen again _ the ruble is sliding, fuel
shortages plague many regions and Russia is starved for the foreign
loans that have kept it afloat for years.
	   ``You will not find anyone arguing in favor of economic growth
next year,'' Jan Lundin, executive director of the Russia-European
Center for Economic Policy, told a news conference Tuesday.
	   The economy, which will shrink about 5 percent this year, is
expected to contract another 3 percent to 9 percent in 1999,
according to the Finance Ministry. Many private economists say
conditions are simply too volatile and unpredictable to even offer
a guess.
	   The country is not even close to resolving key questions such as
how to revive the enfeebled banking system. Russia still has about
1,500 banks, but many are closed or barely functioning, and no more
than half are expected to survive.
	   And with its coffers bare, Russia's government is again facing a
painful choice: should it allow millions of workers to go without
wages, or print piles of money to pay them and then watch inflation
go through the roof?
	   The country's economic options are so constrained these days
that choosing hyperinflation may be about the best it can hope for.
	   Ordinary Russians have shown extraordinary patience in recent
years despite regularly receiving wages months late. Many survive
by growing vegetables on small garden plots, bartering when they
don't have cash and taking informal jobs, such as driving gypsy
cabs.
	   But government payments could become even more irregular in
coming months as Russia's cash sources dry up.
	   The government has been without foreign loans since the crisis
hit, and the chronic problem of collecting taxes has only grown
worse.
	   ``Russia is now effectively cut off from non-inflationary
financing,'' said economist Peter Westin of the Russia-European
Center.
	   That leaves the government with only one real option _ printing
money. This is certain to fuel an inflation rate that will be
around 70 percent this year, and there are widespread fears of a
return to the days of the early 1990s, when inflation was regularly
over 100 percent a year.
	   Since the crisis, the government has shown more restraint than
many predicted. But next year's budget is heavily dependent on
foreign loans that are unlikely to materialize. Even government
economists suspect the proposed budget may not be realistic.
	   ``Experience tells us that the budget that's approved and the
budget that's actually fulfilled are two different things,'' said
economist Vladimir Mau of the government's Working Center for
Economic Reform.
	   Russia has already indicated it won't be able to pay off the
$17.5 billion in foreign debt that falls due next year. The amount,
part of nearly $150 billion in overall foreign debts, will probably
have to be re-negotiated.
	   If foreign lenders are forced to write off billions of dollars
in bad loans to Russia, they aren't likely to hand out additional
money anytime soon.
	   The IMF has frozen a $22.6 billion bailout package, and until
the IMF acts, most other lenders are also expected to stay on the
sidelines.

Russian auto workers kidnap employer to demand wages
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ About 100 women workers at a Siberian auto factory
took their boss hostage to demand their wages, some of which are a
year and a half overdue, a news report said Tuesday.
	   The workers at the Ulan-Ude Auto Factory locked director Leonid
Belykh in his office on Monday and continued to hold him Tuesday,
the Interfax news agency said. It did not say what jobs the women
held.
	   Belykh told the women the wage delays were a result of debts by
the Defense Ministry, which owes the factory 48 million rubles
(dlrs 2.4 million) for back orders. Ulan-Ude is located about 4,400
kilometers (2,700 miles) southeast of Moscow.
	   Russia's cash-strapped government owes workers at state-run
businesses and agencies millions of dollars in back wages.
Employees at hospitals, schools, even nuclear plants have gone on
strike to demand back pay.

<TEXT>
	   CARSON, California (AP) _ Nissan Motor Co. expects to reduce its
work force through attrition as it merges its two California-based
U.S. units, Nissan North America Inc. and Nissan Motor Corp. But
the automaker denied a newspaper report that it would slash 500
jobs in the United States by 2000.
	   ``While we expect to see a reduction in our work force through
natural attrition by the year 2000, there are no planned staff
reductions as a result of this consolidation,'' Nissan North
America said in a statement Tuesday.
	   The Nihon Keizai newspaper in Tokyo, citing unidentified company
sources, said Nissan planned the job cuts as part of a cost-cutting
drive. The report was carried by The Associated Press and other
news services.
	   Last month, Nissan said it expects to lose 30 billion yen (dlrs
250 million) for this fiscal year at the group level, which
includes the parent company and its subsidiaries.
	   It projected losses from its troubled North American operations
at 5 billion yen (dlrs 42 million) this fiscal year. The unit lost
80 billion yen in fiscal 1997.

Blood, rabbits stolen from Russian clinic
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ All the blood supplies and some rabbits used in
experiments at a northern Russian clinic have been stolen,
officials said Tuesday.
	   The blood supplies were for hospitals in the Komi republic,
1,000 kilometers (650 miles) northeast of Moscow. They were stolen
Monday night, clinic chief Andrei Titarenko was quoted by the
ITAR-Tass news agency as saying.
	   The clinic's rabbits also disappeared, and officials fear they
may be sold for meat. But their meat is likely to be dangerous
because the animals have undergone experiments, so police will
inspect rabbits sold at local markets, ITAR-Tass said.
	   It did not say how much blood or how many rabbits were stolen or
give any other details.

NATO ministers say both sides fail to comply in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With NATO &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Albright quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright blasted both Serbs and ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, saying
Tuesday their inflammatory public statements hindered peace efforts
in the Serb province.
	   Albright also warned Serb authorities at a news conference that
NATO ``remains ready to act if necessary'' in Kosovo to stop
continuing violence.
	   Earlier, NATO's 16 foreign ministers issued a statement
deploring the continuing violence and also blamed both sides.
	   ``The security situation in Kosovo remains of great concern to
us,'' the ministers said. ``Since the beginning of November,
violent incidents provoked in some cases by Serbian security forces
and in others by armed Kosovar elements have increased tension.
These incidents show that both the Belgrade authorities and the
armed Kosovar elements have failed to comply fully with the
requirements set on in U.N. Security Council resolutions.''
	   Hundreds of people, mostly civilians, have died and hundreds of
thousands were driven from their homes in seven months of fighting
between the Serb police and armed forces and the rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army.
	   Serbia, the dominant republic in what is left of the Yugoslav
federation, withdrew Kosovo's autonomy in 1989. The ethnic Albanian
majority is now demanding independence, something the Belgrade
authorities have rejected.
	   The fighting was halted and a shaky cease-fire installed only
after NATO threatened to conduct air strikes.
	   ``Both Serb and Albanian leaders have made public statements
that do not help the cause of peace,'' Albright said. ``Serb
threats to launch a renewed offensive in Kosovo are dangerous and
we view them with extreme seriousness.
	   ``I want to remind the Serb leadership that NATO remains ready
to act if necessary. On the other hand, Kosovo Albanian insistence
on rhetoric of independence and rejection of the Contact Group's
draft agreement do have help us to move forward.''
	   The ministers insisted in their joint declaration that both
sides stick to the cease-fire.
	   ``We also expect them to facilitate the war crimes
investigations by the International Tribunal for the former
Yugoslavia (ICTY). In this connection, we deplore the denial of
visas to ICTY investigators.''
	   The ministers urged all parties ``to move rapidly in a spirit of
compromise and accommodation to conclude the negotiating process.''
	   The ministers also condemned recent actions by Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic to suppress the independent media in
Serbia.
	   The alliance said it would continue its air verification
mission, flying surveillance missions over the province, and
pledged its full cooperation to the civilian cease-fire
``verifiers'' under the direction of the 54-nation Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe.

Russia's missile fuel chief under corruption probe
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A corruption investigation was launched Tuesday
against the chief of Russia's missile fuel agency and some of his
colleagues, military prosecutors said.
	   Criminal probes against several Defense Ministry officials were
opened Tuesday, the ITAR-Tass news agency quoted the central
military prosecutor's office as saying.
	   Among targets of the investigations are Lt. Gen. Pavel Goropai,
head of the missile fuel agency, his first deputy Maj. Gen.
Konstantin Kulagin and other agency officials, the report said.
	   It gave no details of their reported offenses.
	   Also Tuesday, Russian Prosecutor General Yuri Skuratov said
corruption in Russia had reached the ``top echelons of power ...
all the ministries, institutions and law enforcement agencies.''
	   ``It is necessary to put things in order at the top level. If
the system itself, the Finance Ministry, for example, keeps under
control the actions of its staff members, then the needed results
will be achieved,'' Skuratov was quoted by ITAR-Tass as saying.
	   He gave no examples of specific instances of corruption.

Parma qualifies for quarterfinals on 3-1 victory
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARMA, Italy (AP) _ Parma qualified for the UEFA Cup
quarterfinals Tuesday rallying to a 3-1 victory, from a 0-1
first-half deficit, against Glasgow Rangers in their third-round
second-leg match.
	   The Italian team preserved a four-year unbeaten home streak in
European games on second-half goals by Abel Balbo, Stefano Fiore
and Enrico Chiesa.
	   Parma advanced on a 4-2 aggregate score following a 1-1 draw in
the first leg at Glasgow.
	   Rangers was eliminated on its first season defeat in the
European competition that it had started from pre-qualifying
rounds.
	   German midfielder Jorg Albertz put the Scottish team ahead in
the 28th minute with a powerful diagonal drive from the penalty
area edge.
	   The Rangers player intercepted an erratic pass by Argentine
defender Nestor Sensini, rushed through the wide-open Parma defense
and sent the ball past national team keeper Gianluigi Buffon.
	   Parma's second-half rally was made easier by the expulsion of
Rangers' Italian defender Sergio Porrini in the 45th minute, which
forced the visitors one player down for the entire second half.
	   Porrini received his second caution in the match when he fouled
Chiesa who had outpaced him.
	   Rangers immediately paid for its reshuffled defense in the 47th
when Argentine veteran forward Balbo, left unmarked close to the
net, kicked in Parma's equalizer.
	   Balbo was fed by Chiesa who headed toward the teammate, from an
angled position, a perfect cross by Argentine Juan Sebastian Veron.
	   Midfielder Stefano Fiore put Parma in front in the 62nd with a
powerful long-distance shot, minutes after entering the field as
substitute for Alain Boghossian.
	   Another Italian defender of Rangers, Lorenzo Amoruso, definitely
sank his team when he handed the ball in the penalty area to stop a
pass to Chiesa.
	   Chiesa, who had tallied Parma's both goals in last Saturday's
2-0 win against Sampdoria of Genoa, converted the penalty kick in
the 68th for the final 3-1 score.
	   Parma, which is tied in second place with AS Roma in the Italian
league standings, kept cool despite the first-half deficite and
took advantage of playing 11 against 10 as Rangers gradually faded
out.

Controversial bill nears a vote in lower house of parliament
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Deputies in France's National Assembly on Tuesday
again took up a controversial bill to give legal status to
unmarried couples, aiming this time to finish the debate quickly.
	   The deputies in the lower house were expected to finally vote on
the measure on Wednesday. Then it would go to the Senate _ probably
in March.
	   The so-called Civil Solidarity Pact has been hotly contested by
the conservative opposition, which fears it could lead to gay
marriages, and to adoptions by gay couples.
	   This is the bill's second attempt at passage in the lower house
of parliament. Rightist politicians finally stopped their delaying
tactics on Tuesday.
	   The bill, which has been laden with hundreds of ammendments,
would allow two unrelated people to form a union that would, among
other things, allow them to file joint tax returns, gain
inheritance benefits, and share social security coverage.

Bordeaux secures goalless draw to reach quarterfinals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BORDEAUX, France (AP) _ Bordeaux played out a 0-0 draw against
Grasshoppers on Tuesday, a result that sends the French league
leader through to the last eight on away goals.
	   The first leg in Zurich ended 3-3.
	   Bordeaux, which reached the UEFA Cup final 1996 with a team
inspired by Zinedine Zidane, controlled most of the match but
failed to break down a Swiss team content to play on the break.
	   Without the injured Kubilay Turkyilmaz, its key striker,
Grasshoppers looked impotent in attack, and had midfielder Mihai
Tararache sent off late in the game for a dangerous tackle.
	   Bordeaux coach Elie Baup, without injured central defender Herve
Alicarte and suspended midfielder Ali Benarbia, stuck to his
pre-match promise to attack, even though his team only needed a
goalless draw to advance.
	   In the 15th minute, Sylvain Wiltord - who scored twice in the
first leg in Zurich and is top scorer in the French league this
season - made a brilliant run down the right wing, but Michel
Pavon's acrobatic header from the resulting cross didn't have
enough power to trouble visiting goalkeeper Pascal Zuberbuehler.
	   Minutes later, Pavon surged forward from midfield but saw his
dangerous cross-shot cleared by the Swiss defense.
	   Grasshoppers had its best chance in the 30th minute, when
Avraham Tikva, not known for his aerial prowess, headed wide when
unmarked eight meters (yards) from goal.
	   Grasshoppers advanced to the third round by default after
Fiorentina, its second round opponent, was expelled from the
competition after an Italian spectator hurled an explosive device
on to the pitch.

Light combat aircraft production by 2003

	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India's homemade Light Combat Aircraft
will begin flight trials next year and production would begin by
2003, a top defense official said Tuesday.
	   Two aircraft _ TD1 and TD2 _ will take to the skies in mid-1999,
A.P.J.Abdul Kalam, head of the Defense Research and Development
Organization, was quoted as saying by Press Trust of India at an
aerospace conference in the southern city of Bangalore.
	   The Light Combat Aircraft, powered by the Indian-built Kaveri
engine, would be low on cost and high on performance, Kalam said.
The light fighter project has experienced massive technical
problems and delays.
	   India is also developing an advanced version of the Light Combat
Aircraft, a stealthy fighter which would be the first multi-role
aircraft of its kind in the region. The twin-engine, long-range
fighter is needed to replace India's Jaguar and Mirage 2000 combat
aircraft.

Netanyahu receives symbolic concessions on Clinton visit

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The United States agreed to key symbolic
concessions Tuesday on U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit to
Israel and the Palestinian areas, extending a helping hand to an
Israeli prime minister under political siege.
	   New clashes erupted in the West Bank as domestic pressure
mounted on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to abandon the Wye
River land-for-security agreement with the Palestinians.
	   The violence and Israel's political turmoil came just five days
before the start of Clinton's visit to Israel and the Palestinian
areas.
	   The trip had been intended to shore up the latest Mideast peace
agreement.
	   In one of several bouquets to Netanyahu, Clinton's top envoy to
the region reversed earlier claims and said the president had
initiated the upcoming visit.
	   ``It was frankly an idea that came up from us,'' Dennis Ross
said after an hourlong meeting in Netanyahu's office.
	   Clinton's visit to Palestinian areas is seen by both sides as a
state visit to an entity Israel insists should not achieve
statehood.
	   Earlier U.S. claims that Netanyahu had suggested the visit at
October's Wye talks angered right-wingers in Netanyahu's Cabinet
and helped lead to a vote Monday in parliament for a no-confidence
motion, to take place in two weeks.
	   Netanyahu has spent much of this week scrambling for support
from both his coalition and from opposition parties _ offering
apparently contradictory commitments.
	   Moshe Peled, a legislator in Netanyahu's coalition who opposes
further concessions to the Palestinians, told Channel 2 TV he now
``understood that the government is determined to stop the (peace)
process.''
	   By contrast, a legislator with the Arab Democratic Party said he
was given assurances that Israel would go ahead with a planned
troop withdrawal from the West Bank.
	   ``They will implement it, they will overcome the problems,''
Abdel Wahab Daroushe told Channel 2.
	   In another symbolic concession to Israel, Clinton also decided
to land at the newly opened Gaza airport in a helicopter instead of
in Air Force One.
	   The originally-planned Air Force One landing would have been
seen by both the Palestinians and the Israelis as emphasizing U.S.
support for Palestinian statehood.
	   Ross also appeared to side with Netanyahu's contention that a
recent surge in violence in the West Bank was backed by the
Palestinian Authority.
	   ``If you have differences, the place to deal with differences is
... at the table,'' Ross said. ``Not on the street, there is no
place for violence in this process.'' Ross was schedule to dine
with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat later Tuesday.
	   The Palestinian Authority has accused Netanyahu of sparking the
increased violence by reneging on an agreement to release
Palestinians jailed on terror charges.
	   Netanyahu, who released 250 prisoners last month _ mostly common
criminals _ says he never agreed to release killers.
	   He said that a promised transfer of five percent of the land
from Israeli control to joint jurisdiction next week would be
delayed if the Palestinians did not contain the violence.
	   ``If there will not be fulfillment of obligations, there will be
no withdrawal,'' he said after meeting Ross.
	   Four Palestinian students, an Israeli soldier and a Jewish
settler girl were injured Tuesday in three separate incidents in
the West Bank.
	   In the Kalandiya refugee camp for Palestinians, hooded high
school students ripped piping off the rooftop of an abandoned
building and tossed it at passing jeeps. Israeli troops fired
rubber bullets in response.

Judge decides to wait on Tyson probation action
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with date set for Maryland sentencing and comments
from Tyson lawyer. &QL; 
 &UR; By HANK LOWENKRON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) _ The Indiana judge who could return Mike
Tyson to prison will await the former heavyweight champion's
February sentencing on Maryland assault charges before making her
decision.
	   Judge Patricia Gifford followed a recommendation from probation
officer George Walker, who said in a probation report it ``may be
desirable to await the outcome'' of misdemeanor assault charges
against Tyson in Maryland.
	   Tyson pleaded no contest there last week. On Tuesday, the
Montgomery County District Court in Maryland set Feb. 5 for
sentencing, said James Voyles, Tyson's Indianapolis lawyer.
	   Walker sent official notice of the Maryland charges to Gifford
on Tuesday, noting Tyson had completed more than 3 1/2 years of his
four years of probation ``with no criminal arrests, and he has been
otherwise compliant and cooperative with this officer.''
	   Walker also noted to Gifford that Tyson has completed more than
the required community service, completed a special counseling
program for sex offenders and continues weekly counseling. His
probation is scheduled to expire in March.
	   Tyson served three years for rape in Indiana, and Gifford will
decide whether he violated terms of his 1995 parole. Two motorists
said he kicked and punched them after an automobile accident in
Maryland in August.
	   Gifford, who did not return a phone call on Tuesday, could have
issued a warrant for Tyson's arrest or scheduled a hearing on the
report from Walker, the chief probation officer for Marion Superior
Court.
	   Voyles, who represented Tyson at his rape trial seven years ago,
said he would assist Maryland lawyer Paul Kemp at the Feb. 5
sentencing hearing.
	   ``Our position, clearly, would be that he's almost at the end of
his probationary period, he's complied with all terms and
conditions of probation up to this point. You can anticipate my
argument,'' Voyles said.
	   But what happens in Maryland could affect Gifford's decision
later, Voyles said.
	   ``A probation violation can occur by merely having an arrest,''
he said. ``So the court has a number of options, and the probation
officer has a number of options, and so they'll look at it very
carefully and make whatever decision they think is appropriate.''
	   Indiana authorities also reviewed the probation _ but took no
action _ after Tyson bit Evander Holyfield's ears during a title
bout in June 1997. The Nevada Athletic Commission stripped Tyson of
his boxing license but reinstated him in October.
	   Tyson plans to fight Francois Botha on Jan. 16. A news
conference was scheduled for Tuesday in Los Angeles to announce the
bout.
	   Walker had said last week Gifford will have great latitude in
responding to his report.
	   ``The judge can do everything from nothing all the way to
imposing the originally suspended sentence, and anything in
between,'' he said.
	   Tyson's no-contest plea was not an admission of guilt. However,
Tyson could face up to 20 years in prison _ 10 years on each count
_ and be fined up to dlrs 5,000. The two men he scuffled with
already have agreed to a settlement to avoid a civil suit.
	   Tyson is training in the Phoenix area and intends to live there.
He already has registered as a sex offender in Arizona as part of
his planned move.
	   Tyson was convicted Feb. 10, 1992, of one count of rape and two
counts of deviate sexual conduct. Gifford sentenced Tyson to 10
years in prison and suspended four. He was released from the
Indiana Youth Center on March 25, 1995, and put on probation for
four years.

Bologna ousts Betis from UEFA Cup despite 1-0 loss
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEVILLE, Spain (AP) _ Italian side Bologna moved into the
quarterfinals of the UEFA Cup on a 4-2 aggregate despite losing to
Spain's Betis 1-0 Tuesday in the third round, second leg of the
UEFA Cup.
	   Oliverio Alvarez scored for Betis in the fourth minute for the
only goal of the match after the Spaniards were hammered 4-1 in the
first leg two weeks ago in Italy.
	   The Seville side led by former Spanish national coach Javier
Clemente was facing an uphill battle all the way, as Bologna's
defense is ranked second in the Italian Serie A.
	   Things started off just as Clemente wanted, as Alvarez slammed
in a ball that had initially been deflected by Bologna goal keeper
Francesco Antonioli.
	   Seville kept pressing and Ivan Perez had a chance to make it 2-0
in the 30th minute but his shot hit an upright.
	   In the second half Bologna held on as the Betis simply wore
itself out physically. As the clock ticked off the final minutes
Bologna went on the counter-attack and had a couple of chances to
tie the game but failed.
	   Some 20,000 people watched the game at Benito Villamarin
Stadium.

GCC official cautions against over-production of oil
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES thruout with al-Hojeilan quotes, other
details; changes overline. &QL; 
 &UR; By ANWAR FARUQI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ The top official of a
Gulf Arab group on Tuesday cautioned oil rich nations against
over-production, saying it is the root cause of falling world
prices.
	   The plea was made by Jamil al-Hojeilan, the secretary-general of
the Gulf Cooperation Council, in a television interview on the
second day of an annual summit of GCC leaders.
	   This year, the meeting focused on the calamitous effects of low
oil prices on the GCC economies.
	   Al-Hojeilan told the Middle East Broadcasting Corp., an Arabic
TV network, that ``the whole problem'' is caused by countries not
sticking to their production quotas.
	   Analysts say Venezuela, Iran, Indonesia and Qatar are the main
over-producers.
	   ``The strategic view of oil policy in the GCC countries is to
keep a balance between supply and demand. We hope that pledges of
abiding by quotas agreed upon are respected,'' al-Hojeilan said.
	   He denied that GCC oil ministers have agreed to reduce
production.
	   Officials attending the summit made such a claim earlier to The
Associated Press and added that the GCC ministers also agreed to
ask other producers in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries to join them in the cuts starting March.
	   ``It is unfounded. It is wrong,'' al-Hojeilan, a Saudi, told the
MBC interviewer.
	   The GCC comprises Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and
the Emirates. All except Oman and Bahrain are members of OPEC.
	   The Gulf countries, which together sit on half the world's
proven oil reserves and depend on exports for 75 percent of their
revenues, have been hard hit by oil prices that plummeted because
of the recession in Asia and warmer-than-usual winters.
	   On Monday, the opening day of the three-day GCC summit, Saudi
Arabia's Crown Prince Abdullah said that ``the main source of our
income has been greatly shaken by the imbalance of the oil
market.''
	   ``The boom days are gone and will never come back to the
region,'' he said.
	   ``Such an imbalance requires us to exert our utmost efforts
inside and outside OPEC,'' said Abdullah, who is leading the Saudi
delegation in place of his ailing half-brother, King Fahd.
	   The GCC meeting comes less than two weeks after OPEC ministers
adjourned a year-end meeting in the Austrian capital Vienna without
agreeing on measures to halt the slide in oil prices.
	   Instead, the 11-nation cartel decided to review the situation in
March, sending markets into gyrations.
	   Shortly before the GCC meeting began, January futures contracts
for Brent crude _ a widely watched benchmark _ fell to a record low
of dlrs 9.92 a barrel on the International Petroleum Exchange in
London. The contracts closed at dlrs 10.26.
	   Gulf oil generally sells at a dollar or two less than the North
Sea's Brent, which itself was selling for around dlrs 20 a barrel
as recently as 1997.
	   The Gulf producers have been grappling with widening budget
deficits and problems paying foreign debts. Saudi Arabia, for
example, had projected a dlrs 4.8 billion budget deficit for 1998,
but analysts predict it will reach dlrs 15 billion.
	   ``The projected increases in the GCC budget deficits are
expected to leave a negative impact on their economic
development,'' said Mohammad Khalfan Khirbash, the Emirates
minister of finance.
	   GCC countries were expected to invest up to dlrs 90 billion in
major projects in the next five years, of which dlrs 25 billion was
to go for the oil and gas sectors. Those plans may have to be
scaled down or shelved altogether.
	   In the defense sector alone, the Gulf Arab countries have bought
tens of billions of dollars in arms over the past decade. They were
expected to spend another dlrs 80 billion more over the next four
years.

Mandela discusses dlrs 1.5 billion arms deal with Saudi
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ South African President Nelson
Mandela on Tuesday met with Saudi King Fahd and discussed a deal to
sell arms worth dlrs 1.5 billion to this oil-rich state, diplomats
said.
	   The two countries have been negotiating the agreement to sell
motorized artillery pieces and anti-aircraft weapons for more than
a year, diplomats who attended the meeting said.
	   They spoke on condition of anonymity. No other details of the
talks were available.
	   Mandela arrived here earlier Tuesday from the United Arab
Emirates where he attended on Monday the opening of the Gulf
Cooperation Council summit. Mandela and U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan were the first leaders outside the group to attend the annual
GCC summit, which first met in 1981.
	   GCC comprises Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, UAE, Oman, Qatar and
Bahrain.
	   The official Saudi Press Agency said Mandela and Fahd
``discussed bilateral relations and ways of strengthening them.''
	   The meeting was attended by Saudi ambassador to the United
States, Bandar bin Sultan, who is considered the architect of
Saudi-South African relations.
	   Mandela was accompanied by South African Foreign Minister Alfred
Nzo, Saudi officials said.
	   Economic relations between the two nations have been growing in
recent years. South Africa hopes the increasing ties will lessen
its reliance on Iran for oil, from which it imports more than
two-thirds of its crude oil needs, according to South African press
reports.
	   During a visit to Saudi Arabia last year, Mandela signed a
tentative agreement on importing 15,000 barrels a day from Saudi
Arabia.
	   Bilateral trade has risen dramatically since the two countries
restored relations in 1994.
	   South Africa's exports to Saudi Arabia more than doubled from
dlrs 47 million in 1994 to dlrs 95 million in 1996. Saudi Arabia's
exports, mainly oil, jumped from dlrs 8 million in 1994 to dlrs 207
million in 1996.
	   Last year, their total trade was dlrs 450 million.

Furor erupts in Ontario over strip search of 20 ninth-graders
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS 3rd graf to CORRECT last name of vice principal to
``MacDonald'' sted ``McDonald''; ADDS that neither could be reached

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ A high school vice principal and gym teacher have
been ordered to stay away from students after they conducted a mass
strip search of ninth-grade boys in quest of some stolen money.
	   The strip search, carried out last week at Kingsville District
High School in southwestern Ontario, prompted a walkout by about
200 students Monday. On Tuesday, Ontario Premier Mike Harris joined
in the widespread condemnation of the search, calling it repulsive.
	   On Friday, gym teacher Dan Bondy summoned vice principal John
MacDonald to help him search students after none of the 20 boys in
a gym class would admit to having stolen dlrs 90 from a fellow
student.
	   The two staff members ordered the boys to come one by one into
an office, where they were subjected to a strip search. The stolen
money was not found.
	   After complaints from parents and students, education officials
opened an investigation of the incident and ordered MacDonald and
Bondy to stay away from students for the time being. Neither man
could be reached for comment Tuesday. They were not at school, and
their telephones went unanswered.
	   ``In my 33 years in education I've never heard anything like
this,'' said Val Pistor, director of education for the regional
school board. He called the search a ``violation of the rights,
dignity and respect of children.''
	   Harris, a conservative who favors back-to-basics reforms in the
public school system, had no sympathy for the two staff members.
	   ``I personally think back to teenage years and Grade 9 and the
challenges of puberty and of a very sensitive age and I can't
imagine that there is a teacher or vice principal anywhere in
Ontario that would have been party to anything like this,'' he
said. ``I find it abhorrent.''
	   Canada's Supreme Court has ruled teachers and principals have
the right to search students on school premises if they believe
school rules are being broken. But the court set guidelines on when
searches are reasonable and how they should be conducted.
	   Ontario's education minister, Dave Johnson, said searches are
supposed to be limited to a search for weapons and drugs, not
money. He said strip searches at schools are never acceptable.
	   Kingsville is about 25 miles (40 kilometers) southeast of
Windsor, Ontario.

Poland rejects missile deal with Israel

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ In the latest disagreement between Poland
and Israel, Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek's government on Tuesday
scrapped a deal reached last year to buy Israeli-made missiles for
the Huzar helicopter.
	   The reversal drew a terse response from Israel's Defense
Ministry, which hinted at possible legal and political fallout from
the decision by Buzek's Cabinet.
	   It also continued a series of disputes between Israel and Poland
that reveal strained relations rooted in Jewish perceptions of
Polish anti-Semitism dating back to the Holocaust and decades of
communist rule in Poland while Israel was closely allied with the
United States.
	   Announcing the decision after Tuesday's weekly Cabinet meeting,
Buzek accused Israel of reneging on an agreement by Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu to allow Poland to field test the NTD missile
under local conditions.
	   Buzek also called the missile deal signed by Poland's previous
leftist government a preliminary agreement. He said scrapping it
will have no legal or financial consequences, the state news agency
PAP reported.
	   Israel's Defense Ministry disputed Buzek's position in a brief
statement.
	   ``From Israel's point of view, the agreement that was signed in
October 1997 is still in force,'' the ministry said. ``Israel is
now considering its response _ political and legal.''
	   Following five years of negotiating with several potential
partners, Poland last year awarded the dlrs 800 million contract to
Israel's Rafael and Elbit Systems Ltd. companies to equip the Huzar
helicopters in line with NATO requirements.
	   Under the deal, which required approval from both governments,
Rafael was to supply the Huzar with anti-tank NTD missiles and
Elbit was to provide electronic integrating systems.
	   But Buzek's Solidarity-led government, which took office shortly
after the agreement was signed, criticized the handling of the
tenders by its ex-communist predecessors and demanded missile
tests.
	   It also decided to seek another tender for the integrating
systems, but has set no date for it.
	   Grzegorz Holdanowicz, who writes for the Polska Zbrojna military
magazine, noted the 1997 agreement with Israel made no mention of
field tests.
	   ``So the other side can say you demanded things that were not
mentioned in the agreement,'' he said, adding that Netanyahu's deal
was made verbally in April and therefore may be a non-issue.
	   With Poland scheduled to join NATO next year, it is trying to
bring its military arsenal up to NATO standards to meet all
requirements for membership.
	   The NTD missile experienced problems when tested in Israel from
February to July, according to Jane's Defense Weekly, a respected
military magazine. It reported in August that some missiles tested
in southern Lebanon went awry, with one killing a civilian.
	   Buzek said Tuesday that Israel wanted an eight-month
postponement in testing the missiles in Poland, which he called
``unacceptable.''
	   Holdanowicz noted that scrapping the deal with Israel further
delays equipping the Huzar with anti-tank weapons, but he added:
``If there are so many questions around this missile, some of them
real, some imagined, then we do not know how in the end it could
work out.''
	   In the United States, one of the unsuccessful bidders for the
Huzar contract _ the Boeing Company _ said in a statement it would
make a new offer when Poland opens the tender process again.
	   Poland's decision adds to a list of disputes with Israel.
Earlier this year, the Israeli government-run Yad Vashem Holocaust
museum formally complained to Poland's government about crosses
erected on a property adjoining the Auschwitz Nazi death camp, now
a museum.
	   On Monday, Poland announced that Israel refused to extradite a
Polish Jew who allegedly committed atrocities against German
prisoners in 1945.

U.N. intensifies hunt for Iraq's illegal arms
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with 32 surprise visits Tuesday;
details &QL; 
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The United Nations on Tuesday launched an
intensive search for Iraq's illegal weapons amid Iraqi charges that
its arms inspectors are again trying to harass Baghdad.
	   ``We are undertaking a very intensive schedule,'' Caroline
Cross, the inspectors' spokeswoman in Baghdad, told The Associated
Press. ``We have several teams in town. We need to test Iraq's
pledge to comply.''
	   The official Iraqi News Agency said the inspectors made 32
surprise visits, the highest since they returned to Baghdad last
month.
	   Iraq did not hide its anger as the weapons inspectors speeded up
their probe. State-run newspapers quoted Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz, currently on a visit to Moscow, as saying that there is
a limit to Iraqi compliance.
	   They quoted him as saying that Iraq has been cooperating with
the U.N. inspectors for more than seven years but is yet to see an
end to economic sanctions.
	   ``This situation is no longer acceptable,'' Aziz was quoted as
saying.
	   The sanctions, imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait,
cannot be lifted until the weapons inspectors certify that Iraq is
free of weapons of chemical and biological weapons and long-range
missiles.
	   Late Monday, Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf said a
team of 39 inspectors has arrived in Iraq, and branded them
``commandos'' trying to create problems. But Ms. Cross, the
inspectors' spokeswoman, denied a new team had come.
	   ``There is no reason for the Iraqis to worry if they are going
to comply,'' she said.
	   There are now about 140 weapons experts in Iraq in addition ``to
several visiting teams,'' she said.
	   On Tuesday, nine arms monitoring groups, two biological warfare
teams and a missile unit conducted the 32 searches, using
helicopters and vehicles, the Iraqi News Agency said.
	   The inspectors resumed their work last month after a nearly
three-month hiatus during which Iraq had banned them from visiting
any new suspected weapons sites. Iraq allowed them back and pledged
full cooperation as the United States and Britain were preparing to
launch military strikes on Nov. 14.
	   Ms. Cross refused to characterize Tuesday's inspections as
``surprise'' but called them the ``usual hard work.''
	   However, chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler had earlier
said that a series of surprise visits would begin Tuesday in a
final test of Baghdad's pledge of cooperation.
	   He said the unannounced checks will finish late this week or
early next week. After that he would report to U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan whether Iraq is making good on its
promise to cooperate.
	   Annan then will report to the U.N. Security Council, which must
decide whether there is room for starting a comprehensive review of
Iraq's compliance with U.N. resolutions.
	   Iraq hopes that the review will lead to lifting the sanctions _
a move that the United States and Britain have not been willing to
guarantee.

Trying to revive Russia's soccer, officials re-elect soccer chief
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Murder, corruption and power struggles have dogged
Russian soccer lately, almost as badly as ridicule and lament
prompted by a string of embarrassing defeats for the Russian
national team.
	   The country's soccer officials resolved to change that Tuesday _
by electing as their leader the same person who has held the post
for nearly 20 years.
	   At a conference of the Russian Soccer Union in Moscow,
Vyacheslav Koloskov received the votes of more than half of the
nearly 100 leaders of local soccer clubs.
	   Koloskov has promised to revive Russian soccer, offering to
expand the powers of local clubs, giving them more control over
their own budgets.
	   Soccer in Russia, once flaunted by the Soviets as a realm of
pure athletic intentions and clean competition, has been making
headlines in newspaper's crime sections in the past few years.
	   Larisa Nechayeva, director general of the Spartak soccer club,
widely considered the country's most popular team, was fatally shot
last year at her home in an apparent contract hit.
	   Koloskov has recently hired bodyguards, saying he has received
threats pressuring him to step down before it's ``too late.''
	   The soccer union leaders feud bitterly and accuse each other of
corruption.
	   Meanwhile, the Russian team has not qualified for the World Cup
since 1990 or any major tournament since the 1992 European
Championship, and it suffered an embarrassing and demoralizing loss
to Iceland this fall in a qualifier for the 2000 European
Championship.
	   ``The situation that has developed in our soccer has the nature
of a real crisis,'' said Anatoly Byshovets, who coached the Soviet
soccer team to a gold medal in the 1988 Olympics, and who was
recently appointed head coach of the Russian Soccer Union.
	   The daily Vremya speculated Tuesday that the soccer chiefs
backed Koloskov's re-election because of his promises to devolve
power to local clubs.
	   ``The liberties that Koloskov intends to give to the regions
turn the seat of a functionary from a local federation into a very
lucrative place,'' Vremya wrote.
	   ``Keeping this kind of concrete profit in mind, it is easy to
part with abstract thoughts about the desirability of reshuffles in
the nation's top soccer leadership.''
	   Koloskov easily defeated his chief opponent, president of the
Dinamo Moscow club, Nikolai Tolstykh.
	   Some were skeptical about whether anything can raise Russia's
soccer from its sad state.
	   ``This is a power struggle going on. Nothing more nor less,''
said Vladimir Alyoshin, general director of Moscow's Luzhniki
sports stadium.

Spacewalking electricians to wire together first two station parts
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Spacewalk scheduled to begin at 3:45 p.m. CST, ahead of
schedule. &QL; 
 &UR; By MARCIA DUNN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Aerospace Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) _ Two spacewalking astronauts faced
the hardest and most important job of their careers Monday: hooking
up 40 electrical connections between the first two pieces of the
international space station.
	   The work called for Jerry Ross, NASA's most experienced
spacewalker, and James Newman to clamp together the connectors for
power and data flow. The spacewalk, the first of three scheduled
for this week, was expected to last 6{ hours.
	   On Sunday, Endeavour's crew used the shuttle's robot arm and
thruster rockets to snap together the Russian-made piece, Zarya,
and the American-built component, Unity, forming a seven-story,
35-ton tower in Endeavour's cargo bay.
	   Construction of the space station hinges on making the hookups,
warned NASA's lead flight director, Bob Castle. Unity, a connecting
passageway, needs the solar power generated by the Zarya control
module to survive.
	   Working 240 miles above Earth, Ross and Newman had 135 tools at
their disposal and a horde of engineers standing by in two
countries to offer advice.
	   Once all the connectors were joined, flight controllers planned
to turn on the power inside the fledgling station.
	   Newman had the more unwieldy job, Ross the more hand-intensive.
	   The plan called for Newman to unclamp each jumper cable and hand
it to Ross to link to its mate on the other side. With each
electrical connector attached to 20- to 30-foot cables, it was
going to be like handling ``an octopus and depending upon how cold
those cables are going to be it could be a relatively stiff
octopus,'' Ross predicted before the flight.
	   Before locking the connectors together, Ross had to inspect each
end to make sure the tiny pins inside were not bent or caked with
debris.
	   Each man's spacesuit was equipped with a mini jetpack in case
their safety lines to the shuttle broke. Endeavour is so loaded
that it would be difficult for it to dash after a runaway
spacewalker.
	   NASA deliberately picked two pros for the job and, even then,
had both men go through 200 hours of training underwater, the
closest approximation to weightlessness on Earth.
	   Ross, 50, a husky Air Force colonel, has made four previous
spacewalks, not to mention real construction experience. He worked
in a steel mill and did highway construction work back in his
college days.
	   The taller, thinner Newman, a 42-year-old physicist, conducted a
station-practice spacewalk in 1993.

Ukrainian customs seize radioactive cargo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukrainian customs officials intercepted a
container with an unidentified radioactive material that a man from
neighboring Moldova tried to take out of Ukraine, a newspaper said
Tuesday.
	   The container was seized at the Ukrainian-Moldovan border during
a search of the Moldovan man's car, whose passengers included three
women and a child, the daily Dyen said. Customs officials searched
the car after receiving a warning from Ukraine's Security Service.
	   The sealed, 42-kilogram (92-pound) container was emitting
radiation at a level 12 times the maximum allowed by Ukrainian
health authorities, the newspaper said. No further details were
released.
	   Meanwhile, in a village in southern Ukraine, Malomykhailyvka,
police recently discovered a 100-kilogram (220-pound) lead box with
a metal-working device containing radioactive cesium, which had
been kept in storage by a 74-year-old villager.
	   The man said the box was brought to him four years ago by his
grandson and that he had no idea about its dangerous contents,
regional civil defense chief Oleksandr Sydoruk told Dyen.
	   Many containers of radioactive isotopes have disappeared from
metallurgy plants, hospitals and other facilities in the former
Soviet Union in recent years. Police say they attract thieves who
mistakenly think the material can be sold as nuclear technology.

Ukrainian court dismisses appeal from soldier sentenced for hazing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A military court in Ukraine has dismissed
an appeal from a soldier sentenced to a prison term and a large
fine for beating to death a fellow serviceman, a newspaper reported
Tuesday.
	   Valeriy Nykonenko was found guilty of killing a new recruit,
Oleksandr Troianovsky, during a hazing session in June 1996, when
Mykonenko and other drunken soldiers attacked 18 younger comrades.
	   The practice of hazing of young recruits by elder soldiers is
widespread in the armies of the former Soviet republics.
	   Mykonenko was sentenced to eight years in prison and a fine of
10,000 hryvna (dlrs 2,920 at the current rate) to compensate the
killed soldier's relatives, Kievskiye Vedomosti reported.
	   But he refused to pay the fine and appealed to a military court,
which has dismissed the appeal. Mykonenko is considering an appeal
to the Supreme Court, the newspaper said.

Poland rejects missile deal with Israel

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Buzek comments grafs 1-4, 8-9; ADDS byline &QL; 
 &UR; By MONIKA SCISLOWSKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Saying Israel failed to fulfill
agreements, Poland on Tuesday rejected a deal to arm its Huzar
helicopter with Israeli-made missiles, Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek
said.
	   Making the announcement after a weekly Cabinet meeting, Buzek
said the deal announced last year was rejected because ``Israel has
failed to hold tests in Poland of the missile that we were to
buy.''
	   He also cited objections raised by the government auditing
agency over the handling of a tender for a separate deal involving
integrating systems for the Huzar helicopter. An Israeli company
also won that contract.
	   Buzek called the missile deal that Poland's previous leftist
government signed with Israel a preliminary agreement and said
scrapping it will have no legal or financial consequences, the
state news agency PAP reported.
	   The decision by Poland adds to a list of disputes with Israel.
Earlier this year, the Israeli government-run Yad Vashem Holocaust
museum formally complained to Poland's government about crosses
erected on a property adjoining the Auschwitz Nazi death camp, now
a museum.
	   On Monday, Poland announced that Israel refused to extradite a
Polish Jew who allegedly committed atrocities against German
prisoners in 1945.
	   Poland's pending membership in NATO, the Western military
alliance, may have influenced its decision to reject the Israeli
missile deal. The former Polish government, which lost power in
elections last year, chose the Israeli company Rafael over the U.S.
company Boeing for the missile deal.
	   Buzek, however, said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
agreed to terms for testing the missiles during a visit to Poland
in April.
	   Poland wanted to test the missiles in Polish weather and terrain
by the end of November, but Buzek said Israel asked to postpone the
tests for eight months, which he called ``unacceptable.''
	   Following five years of negotiating with several potential
partners, Poland last year awarded the dlrs 800 million contract to
Israel's Rafael and Elbit Systems Ltd. companies to equip the Huzar
helicopters in line with NATO requirements.
	   Under the deal, which required approval from both governments,
Rafael was to supply the Huzar with anti-tank NTD missiles and
Elbit was to provide electronic integrating systems.
	   But Poland's Solidarity-led government, which took office
shortly after the agreement was signed, criticized the handling of
the tenders by its ex-communist predecessors and demanded missile
tests. It also decided to seek another tender for the integrating
systems, but has set no date for it.
	   Buzek said the government will continue its plan to arm the
Polish-made Huzar.

Poland rejects missile deal with Israel

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Saying Israel failed to fulfill
agreements, Poland on Tuesday rejected a deal to arm its Huzar
helicopter with Israeli-made missiles, Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek
said.
	   Making the announcement after a weekly Cabinet meeting, Buzek
said the deal announced last year was rejected because ``Israel has
failed to hold tests in Poland of the missile that we were to
buy.''
	   He also cited objections raised by the government auditing
agency over the handling of a tender for a separate deal involving
integrating systems for the Huzar helicopter. An Israeli company
also won that contract.
	   Buzek called the missile deal that Poland's previous leftist
government signed with Israel a preliminary agreement and said
scrapping it will have no legal or financial consequences, the
state news agency PAP reported.
	   But Israel's Defense Ministry, in a brief statement Tuesday,
disputed Buzek's position.
	   ``From Israel's point of view, the agreement that was signed in
October 1997 is still in force,'' the ministry said. ``Israel is
now considering its response _ political and legal.''

International Prosecutor to demand halt to Belgrade court's

massacre probe &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ International war crimes
prosecutors want to stop a Yugoslav military court's investigation
into the role of three former Serb officers in a notorious 1991
massacre.
	   Louise Arbour, chief prosecutor of the Yugoslav War Crimes
Tribunal, will ask judges on Wednesday to order Belgrade
authorities to stop investigating the massacre and hand over any
evidence they have collected. She accused Belgrade of setting up
show proceedings to prevent the three from being extradited for
trial before the U.N. court in The Hague.
	   Given Yugoslavia's track record of defying the tribunal, the
case appears ``designed to shield the accused from international
criminal responsibility,'' Arbour wrote in documents released
Tuesday.
	   The officers were indicted by the tribunal in 1995 for allegedly
ordering the November 1991 massacre of 260 non-Serbs taken out of a
hospital in the Croatian city of Vukovar. The massacre victims are
believed to be Croat civilians, some of whom fought to defend
Vukovar during the Serb siege.
	   Vukovar was besieged and relentlessly shelled in 1991 during the
six-month war between Serbia and Croatia after Zagreb's declaration
of independence from the former Yugoslavia.
	   Former Yugoslav People's Army officers Mile Mrksic, Veselin
Slijvancanin and Miroslav Radic are due to testify on Dec. 17 as
part of the Yugoslav investigation.
	   Under the tribunal's statute, national courts must defer cases
to the tribunal if judges in The Hague order them to do so.
	   Yugoslavia steadfastly refuses to extradite the so-called
``Vukovar Three,'' despite international arrest warrants and
pressure from the U.N. Security Council.
	   Belgrade authorities accuse the tribunal of being anti-Serb and
claim that their constitution bars extraditing the officers. Serbia
is the dominant republic in Yugoslavia.

Kosovo rebels reject U.S. peace draft

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The chief spokesman for Kosovo's
rebels rejected the latest peace plan for the troubled province
today, and called for the removal of its American architect for
alleged pro-Serb bias.
	   But in Brussels, Belgium, NATO foreign ministers endorsed U.S.
diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis and called on Serbs and
ethnic Albanians to ``move rapidly in a spirit of compromise and
accommodation.''
	   The ministers also reaffirmed that any settlement must respect
the territorial integrity of Yugoslavia, putting them at odds with
the ethnic Albanians who are seeking independence for the majority
Albanian province.
	   Rebel spokesman Adem Demaci told reporters that the latest peace
plan drafted by U.S. envoy Christopher Hill was unacceptable
because it doesn't envisage what will happen to the rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army if it was adopted.
	   ``Mr. Hill either doesn't understand the Albanian problems, or
he is leaning toward the Serbs,'' Demaci said. ``The State
Department should reconsider the results of his work ... (and) send
us more qualified people.''
	   Demaci also acknowledged that the KLA was using lull in the
fighting to rearm and prepare for more battles with government
troops.
	   ``The KLA has no illusion that the (Serb) regime will
democratize overnight and that it will give up trying to find a
solution through force for the Kosovo crisis,'' he said. ``It would
be dangerous if the Albanians don't continue arming themselves and
preparing for resistance.''
	   Hundreds of people were killed and almost 300,000 ethnic
Albanians forced from their homes in a seven-month crackdown on
separatists by Serbian forces before an October peace accord.
	   In a statement issued in Brussels, NATO foreign ministers
deplored the violence in Kosovo, blaming both Serbs and ethnic
Albanians.
	   ``Since the beginning of November, violent incidents provoked in
some cases by Serbian security forces and in others by armed
Kosovar elements have increased tension,'' the ministers said.
``(Both sides) have failed to comply fully with the requirements
set on in U.N. Security Council resolutions.''
	   The NATO ministers reaffirmed their support for a political
solution ``which provides an enhanced status for Kosovo, a
substantially greater degree of autonomy and meaningful
self-administration'' but which ``preserves the territorial
integrity'' of Yugoslavia.
	   The Americans and Europeans fear independence would lead to
similar demands by other ethnic Albanian communities elsewhere in
the southern Balkans.
	   The U.S.-based Human Rights Watch, meanwhile, claimed today that
more than 1,000 Kosovo Albanians were in Serbian prisons and police
stations, and said at least five have died from beatings and
torture.
	   The statement, faxed to The Associated Press bureau in Belgrade,
said hundreds of others have been injured from beatings and
torture.

Ukraine's foreign minister to visit China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's Foreign Minister Borys Tarasyuk
will pay an official visit to China on Dec. 10-15 to discuss the
broadening of bilateral economic ties, the ministry said Tuesday.
	   Tarasyuk will meet with his Chinese counterpart Tang Jiaxuan and
other senior Chinese officials.
	   Tarasyuk plans to offer new cooperation projects, such as
supplying turbines produced by Ukraine's Turboatom plant and other
energy equipment, the ministry said.
	   A delegation of Ukrainian businessmen would accompany Tarasyuk.
China is the former Soviet nation's largest trade partner, after
Russia.
	   The sides also plan to discuss political developments in Europe
and the former Soviet Union and Ukraine's stance on its ties with
NATO, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Tarasyuk is expected to reiterate Ukraine's adherence to the
principle of ``one China,'' which recognizes Taiwan as a province
of China.
	   In 1996, Taiwanese Premier Lien Chan unexpectedly visited
Ukraine, drawing protests from China. Beijing claims the island as
a rebel province and demands eventual reunification.

	   BLACE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Teachers dart uneasy glances out
windows of the bullet-pocked school, scanning the road for feared
police. Camouflage-clad rebels hunch behind nearby bushes. All the
schoolbooks are destroyed.
	   The tense province of Kosovo is hardly a suitable environment
for education.
	   But numerous villages are marking small triumphs across the
devastated region, re-opening war-damaged schools as they try to
restore some normalcy to shattered lives.
	   ``It's the first good event in our lives in several months,''
says Avni Hoxha, a 33-year-old ethnic Albanian, picking up his two
children from a battered school building where classes resumed in
this southwestern Kosovo village last week.
	   ``Children must go to school. They need an education,'' he said.
	   The ethnic Albanians say 56 schools were ruined, many others
damaged and still others abandoned in the panic to flee Serbian
forces during this year's punishing campaign against Kosovo
Albanian separatists.
	   Serb children, too, have suffered from safety fears and
relocation during the conflict in the Serbian province, where
Albanians outnumber Serbs by roughly 10 to 1. But the overwhelming
majority of the hundreds of people killed, and schools wrecked,
were ethnic Albanian.
	   As tens of thousands of refugees cautiously return home in the
wake of an October peace agreement and an uneasy truce, getting
schools back in operation has become a top priority. Schools in
Decani, Rastane and Blace are among those that re-opened recently,
with safety assurances from international peace verifiers.
	   ``It's a heartening thing,'' said American peace monitor Brett
Mattei, standing alongside one of the verifiers' orange Humvee
military vehicles in Blace. ``It shows villagers are feeling more
confident, more secure.''
	   Blace (pronounced BLAHT-say), located just off the
Pristina-Prizren highway that police and rebels battled over
fiercely, stood empty for four months until residents who had fled
to forests or other homes began trickling back in late October.
	   Overall, more than 100 houses were wrecked beyond repair. Hasty
repairs were made to get the school up and running despite a
bashed-in roof and no electricity in the village of 6,000.
	   Rain leaks into unusable classrooms, loose wires hang down, and
wooden beams and tree limbs are used to prop up the roof. With only
four rooms in use, the 600 children attend class in three shifts,
from 7:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m.
	   Emotional scars reflect those left by machine-gun bullets on the
faded green outer walls.
	   In Shqipe Bllaca's second-grade class, where war trauma is
etched in the children's drawn faces, pupils and teacher shared
painful war experiences on the first day back in school. One girl
wept as she talked about all the burned houses, Bllaca recalled.
	   Eight-year-old Albina Kroni, gazing with big brown eyes,
struggled for words when asked to recount her family's situation
for visitors.
	   ``I was three months out of my home and my village, and I moved
to three other villages,'' she says solemnly. ``I missed my home.''
	   The village already was poor before the conflict began. The
schoolroom walls are bare and dirty, and there are no books.
	   The children's homework assignment won't be easy: Find a
notebook and a pen.
	   Teachers haven't been paid their monthly salary of $60 in five
months. Two are in jail, suspected by Serb police of ties to the
Kosovo Liberation Army. And there's only enough wood on hand to
keep the school stoves burning for two weeks.
	   But Bllaca, who wears a parka to ward off the classroom chill,
said the children and teachers are glad to be back.
	   ``I don't worry about our difficult conditions in school,'' the
32-year-old teacher says. ``I worry about our difficult conditions
in general.''
	   ``I worry about peace for our children.''
	   On the school playground, boys sing songs about the Kosovo
Liberation Army and play war games. They dream of becoming rebel
fighters, and sometimes flash victory signs as armored Serb police
cars rumble past on patrol.
	   Parents and teachers know there's no way to keep the war
atmosphere outside school walls.
	   ``It's our reality,'' says Muhamet Bajraktari, the school's
principal. ``They can't escape it.''

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbs and ethnic Albanians joined
Tuesday in rejecting the latest U.S. plan for Kosovo, despite a
NATO appeal for the two sides to show a spirit of compromise in the
search for peace in the embattled province.
	   Ratko Markovic, head of Serbian government team for talks with
ethnic Albanians, said the U.S. draft would require
``reconstructing the whole of Yugoslavia'' and would pave the way
for independence for the majority ethnic Albanian province.
	   On Monday, the chief ethnic Albanian negotiator, Fehmi Agani,
rebuffed the plan, saying it made too many concessions to the
Serbs.
	   On Tuesday, Adem Demaci, chief spokesman of the rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army, joined in criticizing the plan, drafted by U.S.
envoy Christopher Hill. Demaci suggested Hill was biased and should
be replaced.
	   ``Mr. Hill either doesn't understand the Albanian problems, or
he is leaning toward the Serbs,'' Demaci said. ``The State
Department should reconsider the results of his work ... (and) send
us more qualified people.''
	   Although the KLA is not a party to the deliberations, its
support is considered critical to ensuring that any future plan
actually brings peace to the province, where ethnic Albanians
outnumber Serbs 9-to-1.
	   Kosovo is a province in Serbia, the dominant republic in
Yugoslavia.
	   Hundreds of people were killed and almost 300,000 ethnic
Albanians forced from their homes in a seven-month crackdown on
separatists by Serbian forces before an October peace accord.
	   The accord, reached under threat of NATO airstrikes, was seen as
a way to buy time for a diplomatic solution acceptable to both
Serbs and ethnic Albanians. But with little sign of progress, fears
are mounting that full-scale fighting could erupt, perhaps in the
spring, when snows will melt along the mountain passes to Albania,
where the rebels maintain sanctuaries.
	   In Brussels, Belgium, NATO foreign ministers endorsed U.S.
diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis and called on Serbs and
ethnic Albanians to ``move rapidly in a spirit of compromise and
accommodation.''
	   The ministers endorsed a plan that would give Kosovo ``a
substantially greater degree of autonomy and meaningful
self-administration'' but said any settlement must respect the
territorial integrity of Yugoslavia _ putting them at odds with
ethnic Albanians seeking independence.
	   The Americans and Europeans fear independence would lead to
similar demands by other ethnic Albanian communities elsewhere in
the southern Balkans.
	   In rejecting the Hill plan, Demaci acknowledged that the KLA was
using lull in the fighting to rearm and prepare for more battles
with government troops.
	   ``The KLA has no illusion that the (Serb) regime will
democratize overnight and that it will give up trying to find a
solution through force for the Kosovo crisis,'' he said. ``It would
be dangerous if the Albanians don't continue arming themselves and
preparing for resistance.''
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who was attending
the NATO meeting, criticized the Kosovo Albanians' ``rhetoric of
independence,'' which she said did not ``help us to move forward.''
	   She also warned the Serb leadership that the Western alliance
was ``ready to act if necessary'' to preserve the shaky cease-fire.
	   In a statement issued in Brussels, NATO foreign ministers
deplored the violence in Kosovo, blaming both Serbs and ethnic
Albanians.
	   ``Since the beginning of November, violent incidents provoked in
some cases by Serbian security forces and in others by armed
Kosovar elements have increased tension,'' the ministers said.
``(Both sides) have failed to comply fully with the requirements
set on in U.N. Security Council resolutions.''
	   The U.S.-based Human Rights Watch, meanwhile, claimed Tuesday
that more than 1,000 Kosovo Albanians are being held in Serbian
prisons and police stations, and said at least five have died from
beatings and torture.
	   The statement, faxed to The Associated Press in Belgrade, said
hundreds of others have been injured from beatings and torture.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbs and ethnic Albanians joined
Tuesday in rejecting the latest U.S. plan for Kosovo, despite a
NATO appeal for a spirit of compromise to find peace in the
embattled province.
	   Ratko Markovic, head of the Serbian government's negotiating
team, said the U.S. draft would require ``reconstructing the whole
of Yugoslavia'' and would pave the way for independence for the
majority Albanian province.
	   The chief spokesman for the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army also
rejected the plan drafted by American envoy Christopher Hill. Adem
Demaci suggested Hill was biased and should be replaced.
	   ``Mr. Hill either doesn't understand the Albanian problems, or
he is leaning toward the Serbs,'' Demaci said. ``The State
Department should ... send us more qualified people.''
	   On Monday, the chief ethnic Albanian negotiator, Fehmi Agani,
also rebuffed the plan, saying it made too many concessions to the
Serbs.
	   Although the KLA is not a party to the deliberations, its
support is considered critical.
	   Kosovo is a province in Serbia, the dominant republic in
Yugoslavia.
	   Hundreds of people were killed and almost 300,000 ethnic
Albanians forced from their homes in a seven-month crackdown on
separatists by Serbian forces before an October peace accord.
	   The accord, reached under threat of NATO airstrikes, was seen as
a way to buy time to allow diplomacy to work.
	   But with little sign of diplomatic progress, fears are mounting
that full-scale fighting could erupt again, perhaps in the spring.
	   In Brussels, Belgium, NATO foreign ministers endorsed U.S.
diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis and called on Serbs and
ethnic Albanians to ``move rapidly in a spirit of compromise and
accommodation.''
	   The ministers also reaffirmed that any settlement must respect
the territorial integrity of Yugoslavia, putting them at odds with
the ethnic Albanians who are seeking independence for the province.
	   In rejecting the Hill plan, Demaci acknowledged that the KLA was
using the lull in the fighting to re-arm.
	   ``It would be dangerous if the Albanians don't continue arming
themselves and preparing for resistance,'' he said.
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who was attending the
NATO meeting, blasted the Kosovo Albanians' ``rhetoric of
independence,'' which she said did not ``help us to move forward.''
	   She also warned the Serb leadership that the Western alliance
was ``ready to act if necessary'' to preserve the shaky cease-fire.
	   The U.S.-based Human Rights Watch, meanwhile, claimed Tuesday
that more than 1,000 Kosovo Albanians are being held in Serbian
prisons and police stations, and said at least five have died from
beatings and torture.
	   The statement, faxed to The Associated Press bureau in Belgrade,
said hundreds of others have been beaten and tortured.

New Venezuelan president's past bars him entry to U.S.
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GEORGE GEDDA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ He may be the choice of the Venezuelan people,
but, for now, President-elect Hugo Chavez is on a U.S. immigration
service ``lookout list'' of undesirables who are not to be admitted
to the United States.
	   The list, sometimes referred to the ``terrorist watch list,'' is
meant to exclude foreigners who engaged in ``any activity which is
unlawful under the laws of the of the place where it is
committed.''
	   U.S. officials cited that section of the Immigration and
Nationality Act as the reason Chavez was denied a U.S. visa in
1996. He had applied after staging an unsuccessful coup attempt
against Venezuela's democratically elected government in 1992. He
was pardoned in 1994 after serving two years in prison.
	   State Department officials asked Tuesday about Chavez visa
status would say only that he has an ``ineligibility.'' The section
of the act which provides the rationale for his exclusion is titled
``Terrorist Activities.''
	   The officials, who spoke only on condition of anonymity, did not
classify Chavez as a terrorist, however.
	   The Clinton administration has adopted a conciliatory stance
toward Chavez since his election, congratulating him on his victory
and saying it looks forward to working with his government.
	   On Monday, State Department spokesman James Foley said heads of
state normally receive a diplomatic visa to visit the United
States, and that ``the U.S. government is prepared to take the
necessary steps to address any request for a visa that
president-elect Chavez may make.''.
	   Officials acknowledged on Tuesday they had heard reports that
Chavez may apply for a visa before his Feb. 2 inauguration.
	   Otto Reich, a former U.S. ambassador to Venezuela, said Chavez,
in early campaign speeches, sought support by mentioning the U.S.
denial of his visa request. But he dropped the issue, apparently
when it failed to galvanize his listeners, he said.
	   ``The United States should listen very carefully to which of
Chavez's political messages he chooses to issue at this time,''
said Reich, who served in Venezuela from 1986-89.
	   ``There is the coup-plotting, violent, class-warfare Chavez.
Then there is the conciliatory, democratic anti-corruption,
pro-business Chavez.''
	   Reich, who was part of an international group which monitored
the elections, said Chavez issued no anti-American statements
during many hours of speeches and news conferences.
	   He said the Clinton administration also should pay close heed to
whom Chavez appoints to high posts. Chavez has a choice of
appointing ``respected moderates'' or ``leftist radicals'' who
joined him in his campaign, he said.

Polgar, Karpov match in question, Polgar vs Kasparov likely
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ The Las Vegas ``battle of the sexes''
match between chess champions Anatoly Karpov and Zsuzsa Polgar is
off for now for lack of funds, the state-run news agency MTI
reported Tuesday.
	   ``Until the prize money has been placed with a lawyer, there is
no sense discussing a match,'' said Laszlo Polgar, the
father-manager of the three Polgar grandmasters, denying earlier
reports of a dlrs 300,000 tournament in Las Vegas this month.
	   Karpov, 47, is the reigning champion of the World Chess
Federation, known by its French acronym FIDE. Zsuzsa Polgar, 29, is
the reigning world women's champion.
	   She became a grandmaster in 1991 and once beat Karpov, the
world's fifth-ranked player.
	   Her sister, Judit, 21, the world's top female chess player,
defeated Karpov in June in Budapest.
	   Laszlo Polgar said Judit will likely play against Garry Kasparov
next year, but did not specify any details.
	   The third Polgar daughter, Zsofia, is also among the world's top
20 female chess players. Zsofia is one year younger than Judit.

NATO ministers say both sides fail to comply in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With NATO &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Albright quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright blasted both Serbs and ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, saying
Tuesday their inflammatory public statements hindered peace efforts
in the Serb province.
	   Albright also warned Serb authorities at a news conference that
NATO ``remains ready to act if necessary'' in Kosovo to stop
continuing violence.
	   Earlier, NATO's 16 foreign ministers issued a statement
deploring the continuing violence and also blamed both sides.
	   ``The security situation in Kosovo remains of great concern to
us,'' the ministers said. ``Since the beginning of November,
violent incidents provoked in some cases by Serbian security forces
and in others by armed Kosovar elements have increased tension.
These incidents show that both the Belgrade authorities and the
armed Kosovar elements have failed to comply fully with the
requirements set on in U.N. Security Council resolutions.''
	   Hundreds of people, mostly civilians, have died and hundreds of
thousands were driven from their homes in seven months of fighting
between the Serb police and armed forces and the rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army.
	   Serbia, the dominant republic in what is left of the Yugoslav
federation, withdrew Kosovo's autonomy in 1989. The ethnic Albanian
majority is now demanding independence, something the Belgrade
authorities have rejected.
	   The fighting was halted and a shaky cease-fire installed only
after NATO threatened to conduct air strikes.
	   ``Both Serb and Albanian leaders have made public statements
that do not help the cause of peace,'' Albright said. ``Serb
threats to launch a renewed offensive in Kosovo are dangerous and
we view them with extreme seriousness.
	   ``I want to remind the Serb leadership that NATO remains ready
to act if necessary. On the other hand, Kosovo Albanian insistence
on rhetoric of independence and rejection of the Contact Group's
draft agreement do have help us to move forward.''
	   The ministers insisted in their joint declaration that both
sides stick to the cease-fire.
	   ``We also expect them to facilitate the war crimes
investigations by the International Tribunal for the former
Yugoslavia (ICTY). In this connection, we deplore the denial of
visas to ICTY investigators.''
	   The ministers urged all parties ``to move rapidly in a spirit of
compromise and accommodation to conclude the negotiating process.''
	   The ministers also condemned recent actions by Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic to suppress the independent media in
Serbia.
	   The alliance said it would continue its air verification
mission, flying surveillance missions over the province, and
pledged its full cooperation to the civilian cease-fire
``verifiers'' under the direction of the 54-nation Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe.

Trying to revive Russia's soccer, officials re-elect soccer chief
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Moved previously to news lines &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Murder, corruption and power struggles have dogged
Russian soccer lately, almost as badly as ridicule and lament
prompted by a string of embarrassing defeats for the Russian
national team.
	   The country's soccer officials resolved to change that Tuesday _
by electing as their leader the same person who has held the post
for nearly 20 years.
	   At a conference of the Russian Soccer Union in Moscow,
Vyacheslav Koloskov received the votes of more than half of the
nearly 100 leaders of local soccer clubs.
	   Koloskov has promised to revive Russian soccer, offering to
expand the powers of local clubs, giving them more control over
their own budgets.
	   Soccer in Russia, once flaunted by the Soviets as a realm of
pure athletic intentions and clean competition, has been making
headlines in newspaper's crime sections in the past few years.
	   Larisa Nechayeva, director general of the Spartak soccer club,
widely considered the country's most popular team, was fatally shot
last year at her home in an apparent contract hit.
	   Koloskov has recently hired bodyguards, saying he has received
threats pressuring him to step down before it's ``too late.''
	   The soccer union leaders feud bitterly and accuse each other of
corruption.
	   Meanwhile, the Russian team has not qualified for the World Cup
since 1990 or any major tournament since the 1992 European
Championship, and it suffered an embarrassing and demoralizing loss
to Iceland this fall in a qualifier for the 2000 European
Championship.
	   ``The situation that has developed in our soccer has the nature
of a real crisis,'' said Anatoly Byshovets, who coached the Soviet
soccer team to a gold medal in the 1988 Olympics, and who was
recently appointed head coach of the Russian Soccer Union.
	   The daily Vremya speculated Tuesday that the soccer chiefs
backed Koloskov's re-election because of his promises to devolve
power to local clubs.
	   ``The liberties that Koloskov intends to give to the regions
turn the seat of a functionary from a local federation into a very
lucrative place,'' Vremya wrote.
	   ``Keeping this kind of concrete profit in mind, it is easy to
part with abstract thoughts about the desirability of reshuffles in
the nation's top soccer leadership.''
	   Koloskov easily defeated his chief opponent, president of the
Dinamo Moscow club, Nikolai Tolstykh.
	   Some were skeptical about whether anything can raise Russia's
soccer from its sad state.
	   ``This is a power struggle going on. Nothing more nor less,''
said Vladimir Alyoshin, general director of Moscow's Luzhniki
sports stadium.

Bologna ousts Betis from UEFA Cup despite 1-0 loss
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEVILLE, Spain (AP) _ Italian side Bologna moved into the
quarterfinals of the UEFA Cup on a 4-2 aggregate despite losing to
Spain's Betis 1-0 Tuesday in the third round, second leg of the
UEFA Cup.
	   Oliverio Alvarez scored for Betis in the fourth minute for the
only goal of the match after the Spaniards were hammered 4-1 in the
first leg two weeks ago in Italy.
	   The Seville side led by former Spanish national coach Javier
Clemente was facing an uphill battle all the way, as Bologna's
defense is ranked second in the Italian Serie A.
	   Things started off just as Clemente wanted, as Alvarez slammed
in a ball that had initially been deflected by Bologna goal keeper
Francesco Antonioli.
	   Seville kept pressing and Ivan Perez had a chance to make it 2-0
in the 30th minute but his shot hit an upright.
	   In the second half Bologna held on as the Betis simply wore
itself out physically. As the clock ticked off the final minutes
Bologna went on the counter-attack and had a couple of chances to
tie the game but failed.
	   Some 20,000 people watched the game at Benito Villamarin
Stadium.

Lyon prevails after 7-goal match to reach quarterfinal of UEFA Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUGGE, Belgium (AP) _ Captain Alain Caveglia scored three goals
Tuesday to earn France's Olympique Lyon a tough 4-3 victory over
Belgian champion FC Brugge and lead his team into the quarterfinals
of the UEFA Cup for the first time in 30 years.
	   Lyon had already beaten FC Brugge 1-0 in the first leg of the
third round two weeks ago. Lyon advanced on a 5-3 aggregate.
	   Forward Caveglia put Lyon on the right track in the 16th minute
when his freekick from the left slipped through the FC Brugge wall
and also through the hands of goalie El-Sayed Nader. The
goalkeeper's blunder put Lyon in an ideal position.
	   By the 55th minute, Brugge was run ragged chasing its opening
goal when Caveglia hooked and weaved his way past defender Tjorven
De Brul twice before beating Nader with an exquisite right-foot
curling shot.
	   FC Brugge had enough pride though to keep on pushing and after a
scrappy goal from De Brul in the 63rd minute, Olivier De Cock
brought a glimmer of hope back to the 14,000 fans at the Breydel
Stadium when he deflected a high cross by playmaker Darco Anic past
Gregory Coupet.
	   But Caveglia refused to let his night be spoiled by the
Belgians. When Lyon countered against an increasingly offensive
Brugge, the captain made space for himself again and tapped in a
simple go-ahead goal that seemed to put the match away for good in
the 71st minute.
	   The Belgian champions never gave up though, and a beautiful
freekick by Anic from 20 meters out put both sides level again in
the 73rd minute.
	   The match though, had turned into a cat and mouse and when
Brugge threw caution to the wind again and depleted its defensive
line, forward Vikash Dhorasoo showed his pace and a cool head to
score Lyon's fourth.
	   It was Lyon's seventh away victory in Europe in its last eight
European rounds.
	   FC Brugge : El-Sayed Nader; Nzelo Lembi, Tjorven De Brul,
Alexandar Ilic, Vital Borkelmans; Olivier De Cock, Franky Van der
Elst, Gert Claesens, Darco Anic; Sven Vermant (46, Khalilou
Fadiga), Edgaras Jankauskas (67, Koen Schockaert).
	   Olympique Lyon : Gregory Coupet; Patrice Carteron; Florent
Laville, Hubert Fournier, Christophe Delmotte, Jacek Bak; Steed
Malbranque, David Linares, Philippe Violeau, Vikash Dhorasoo; Alain
Caveglia (77, Frederic Kanoute).

	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Striker Marco Bode scored the only
goal in the 23rd minute to lead Werder Bremen to its fourth
consecutive Bundesliga victory at bottom-locked Borussia
Moenchengladbach on Tuesday.
	   The 1-0 win before 23,000 disappointed Moenchengladbach fans
lifted Bremen three places to 10th as the team continued its
recovery under new coach Felix Magath.
	   Moenchengladbach, which lost to second-division Oberhausen last
week in the quarterfinals of the German Cup, had its lineup
reshuffled by coach Rainer Bonhof, but to no avail.
	   The match between Hertha Berlin and SC Freiburg, which also had
been postponed from Saturday, again had to be called off because of
icy conditions.

Thousands of university teachers, administrators on strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN'A, Yemen (AP) _ About 1,500 teachers and 3,000
administrative workers at a Yemeni university walked off their jobs
Tuesday to press for a 50 percent salary hike, officials said.
	   The San`a University employees in the capital San'a and its
several campuses across the country vowed to remain on strike until
their demands are met, said the officials who spoke on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   Some 70,000 students were left without classes.
	   A similar strike in June ended after the government agreed to a
50 percent raise, but the strikers say the promise was never
fulfilled.
	   University teachers earn between dlrs 300 and dlrs 500 a month

Israel allows some Palestinian rejectionists into Gaza, blocks
</HEADLINE>
others &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NABLUS, West Bank (AP) _ Israel has agreed to allow 18 opponents
of the peace process into Gaza to attend a meeting of the Palestine
National Council next week, the PNC announced Tuesday _ but has
blocked representatives of a key faction.
	   Israel demands that the PNC _ a parliament in exile _ renounce
passages of the 30-year-old Palestine National Charter calling for
Israel's destruction as a condition of relinquishing further
territory in the West Bank.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton will attend the PNC meeting on
Monday in an effort to press the amendment.
	   Prior attempts by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to renounce
the offending passages have been dismissed by Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu's government as not going far enough.
	   Arafat probably has the necessary majority to amend the charter,
but the PNC requires a quorum _ two thirds of its 600 members _ to
do so.
	   About half live in Palestinian-controlled territories, and half
live abroad.
	   Israel maintains a security veto over who enters Gaza. The 18 it
is allowing to enter include Farouk Kaddoumi, the chief of the
PLO's political department, and representatives of the rejectionist
Syria-based Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine.
	   But Israel would not allow members of George Habash's Popular
Front for the Liberation of Palestine _ another Syria-based
rejectionist group _ to enter.
	   Further refusals would likely prompt the Palestinians to accuse
Israel of putting them in a Catch-22 situation _ demanding a
constitutional renunciation of the offending passages of the
charter, but not allowing them the necessary quorum to do so.

Governors briefed on Olympic outlook, two-referee experiment
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with additional background on Olympic outlook &QL; 
 &UR; By MEL REISNER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHOENIX (AP) _ National Hockey League owners put off a decision
on whether the league will have its players return to the Olympics
in 2002.
	   ``They've more or less told us they have to know in February so
that they can get on with their lives in terms of how to proceed,''
NHL commissioner Gary Bettman said Monday. ``We're on a 60- to
90-day window to either do this or not.''
	   The issue has been a thorny one since the Nagano Olympics in
February, where the NHL players were most notable for playing
poorly and trashing a suite in Olympic village. The NHL took a
three-week break to allow players to skate for their national
teams, only to see CBS relegate the games to its late-night show.
	   Toronto Maple Leafs president Ken Dryden, an alternate NHL
governor, said waiting to decide wouldn't hurt preparations for the
2001-2002 season, including preseason games.
	   ``We won't know the schedule until we figure out whether or not
we're doing the Olympics,'' Dryden said.
	   Other issues discussed Monday during the first day of a two-day
meeting included: this season's two-referee experiment; overtime
options to help break ties; how well offseason tinkering has worked
to increase scoring; and the status of troubled franchises in
Pittsburgh and New York's Long Island.
	   The governors discussed creating a dlrs 300 million collective
bargaining fund and renewed their working agreement with the
Canadian Hockey League's cluster of junior major teams.
	   Bettman said the governors also will wait until their next
meeting to decide whether to continue to tinker with two referees
on the ice along with two linesmen and use the four-official setup
during playoff games.
	   Colin Campbell, the NHL's senior vice president of hockey
operations, said the system has streamlined games without
congesting the playing area.
	   ``The flow is better and the obstruction is less,'' he said,
explaining that one referee can hang back and make sure that
players stay within the rules away from the puck while the other
skates ahead of the rush up-ice.
	   It's an advantage that Campbell believes accounts for a drop in
fighting to an average of 1.3 fights per game from 1.6 last year.
	   Officials also are able to watch jostling around the net before
making in-the-crease calls.
	   Deterrents to the program are the cost and the amount of
training it takes to send another NHL-caliber referee onto the ice.

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Infants in the United States should be vaccinated
against the leading cause of diarrhea, an illness which annually
sends 55,000 people to hospitals, kills 40 children and costs dlrs
400 million to treat, a top pediatricians' group says.
	   The three-dose vaccine against rotavirus, an intestinal
infection, should prevent thousands of preschoolers in the United
States from suffering severe diarrhea, health officials said.
	   ``In order to protect against the large number of children who
need to be hospitalized, we need to give the vaccine to
everybody,'' Dr. Neal Halsey, director of disease control at Johns
Hopkins University and chair of the committee that drew up the
recommendations for the American Academy of Pediatrics.
	   The committee that makes vaccine recommendations for the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention has adopted the same
recommendation, Halsey said.
	   The vaccine costs dlrs 38 per dose wholesale. Doses of the
vaccine, which are squirted from a dropper into a baby's mouth, are
recommended at ages 2 months, 4 months and 6 months.
	   The vaccine promises to reduce by up to 80 percent the worst
cases of diarrhea caused by rotaviruses. In the most severe cases,
a child can experience 10 to 20 episodes of diarrhea in a day,
quickly getting dangerously dehydrated.
	   Three million American children are sickened by rotavirus
annually, and 40 die. In developing countries with poor health
care, rotavirus kills about 1 million children a year.

Brazil's president confident country will weather crisis despite
</HEADLINE>
bumps &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) _ President Fernando Henrique Cardoso
predicted Tuesday that early 1999 would be a difficult time
economically, but that international support for the country's
fiscal reform efforts remained strong and that Brazil would weather
the crisis.
	   Cardoso claimed the recent defeat in Congress of a measure that
would have raised social security taxes for civil servants and cut
pensions _ a key element of his fiscal program _ would not hurt the
country in the long-run.
	   ``It's only a mishap along the path,'' Cardoso said. The measure
would have saved the government 2.5 billion reals (dlrs 2.1
billion) a year.
	   Cardoso made his remarks following a luncheon with visiting
Norwegian Premier Kjell Magne Bondevik.
	   Cardoso told reporters he was confident Congress would approve
the Fiscal Stability Plan, which formed the basis for the dlrs 41.5
billion IMF-led credit line announced last month to restore
investor confidence and shore-up the country's ailing economy.
	   But, he added, ``economic miracles don't exist and that
difficulties might be experienced at the beginning of 1999.''
	   Later in the day, Finance Minister Pedro Malan appeared before
the Senate's economic affairs committee to explain the terms of the
agreement with the International Monetary Fund.
	   Speaking before the committee, Malan restated that the agreement
would not require Brazil to change its foreign exchange policy.
Brazil currently devaluates its currency, the real, at a rate of
around 7 percent a year.
	   He also said that the money from the credit line would be
applied to the country's foreign reserves which he said dropped by
dlrs 1 billion in November.
	   The last official data from the Central Bank showed Brazilian
reserves at dlrs 42.39 billion at the end of October, down from the
dlrs 45.81 billion end-September figure. Brazil's reserves stood at
dlrs 70 billion in July, before economic crisis in Russia eroded
investor confidence in the world's emerging markets.

President-elect's call for national reconciliation calms investor

comments in 3rd graf. INCORPORATES Venezuela-Chavez, ADDS photos &QL;

<TEXT>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ President-elect Hugo Chavez's call for
national reconciliation after one of Venezuela's most divisive
campaigns appears to be calming fears of a business community that
has long seen the former coup leader as a villain.
	   The Caracas Stock Exchange soared by a dazzling 22.2 percent
Tuesday _ a sign investors are willing to give Chavez a chance.
	   ``We are advancing toward a situation of full confidence and
that is going to ease the startup of our government,'' Chavez, who
won the presidency by a landslide Sunday, told reporters in
Caracas. ``As president elect, I'm guaranteeing judicial security
and respect for investments.''
	   Yet business leaders are concerned that Chavez's call for a new
constitution could divert attention away from Venezuela's most
pressing problem: an economic tailspin caused by a slump in oil
prices. Venezuela has more oil reserves than any country outside
the Middle East.
	   The financial sector is also worried about comments Chavez, 44,
made about giving the central government a bigger role in the
internal affairs of the state-run oil company, Petroleos de
Venezuela.
	   But in general, Chavez's pleas for ``magnanimity in victory''
and ``strict fiscal discipline'' have been remarkably well-received
by the business community.
	   ``The market is giving him the benefit of the doubt,'' said
Ricardo Penfold, Vice President of Research at Santander investment
bank in Caracas. ``But he still has to deliver with sound economic
policies and a new cabinet that has as much credibility as he has
gained in only two days.''
	   Chavez's victory was a major blow to the political and economic
establishment that has ruled Venezuela during 40 years of
democracy. The election campaign pitted the poor who idolize Chavez
against the rich who direly predicted the cashiered lieutenant
colonel would impose a dictatorship.
	   Chavez, who tried and failed to overthrow Venezuela's
democratically elected government in 1992, rode a wave of fierce
public anger over declining living standards and rampant
corruption.
	   After winning, he announced a frontal attack on corruption,
saying he expected to save billions of dollars a year just by
getting rid of graft in the customs service. He also called for a
crackdown on tax evaders and an ambitious trimming of Venezuela's
notoriously bloated bureaucracy.
	   Analysts agreed Tuesday's financial exuberance could be
short-lived because of the nation's deep economic woes. After
growing by more than 5 percent in 1997, the economy is expected to
shrink 1 percent this year. Low oil prices have forced the
government to slash the budget by some dlrs 2 billion this year,
sacrificing badly needed social programs.
	   This year's budget deficit is estimated at between dlrs 3
billion and dlrs 3.5 billion, and it is expected to balloon to dlrs
5 billion in 1999.
	   The fiscal imbalance could make Chavez's vows to increase the
minimum wage and overhaul the health and education systems
difficult to honor. The president-elect says the money will come
from eliminating corruption and collecting more taxes, but
economists say that is probably unrealistic.
	   Some Venezuelans also think Chavez's promised Feb. 15 referendum
to decide whether to convene a constituent assembly to write a new
constitution is ill-advised because of the economic crisis.
	   ``It could distract the government's emphasis from the economic
to the political at a time a very large fiscal crisis should force
it to devote its energies to confront the economic problem,'' said
Luis Henrique Ball, president of Conindustria, an umbrella group of
industrial chambers.

Spain's Celta dumps Liverpool from UEFA Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LIVERPOOL, England (AP) _ Spanish side Celta Vigo added to
Liverpool's mounting woes, knocking the storied English side out of
the UEFA Cup on a 4-1 aggregate after a 1-0 win in Tuesday's
third-round, second-leg match at Anfield.
	   Israeli international Haim Revivo scored in the 57th as he broke
down the left side and then cut in front of the box and beat David
James on a low shot from 10 meters (yards).
	   Revivo started the game in place of Bulgarian Lubo Penev, who
sat out because of suspension.
	   The loss was Liverpool's fifth in seven matches as the famed
English side _ twice winners of the UEFA Cup and four-time European
Champions Cup winners _ was out-passed and out-played by the
quick-moving Spanish team.
	   The first half presented few scoring chances with Juan Sanchez
probably having the best opportunity when his 18-meter (yard) shot
after only 69 seconds was stopped by Liverpool goalie James,
preventing an early Spanish onslaught.
	   Liverpool, playing without suspended players Steve McManaman,
Paul Ince and Jamie Redknapp, had few clear chances before an
Anfield stadium only two-thirds full.

U.N. intensifies hunt for Iraq's illegal arms
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with details of 32 searches, some in helicopters; no
pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. inspection teams launched a series of
surprise searches Tuesday for banned Iraqi weapons despite angry
assertions from Baghdad that the searches amount to harassment.
	   ``We are undertaking a very intensive schedule,'' said Caroline
Cross, the spokeswoman in Baghdad for the U.N. Special Commission,
which oversees the inspections. ``We have several teams in town. We
need to test Iraq's pledge to comply.''
	   The official Iraqi News Agency said the inspectors _ some using
helicopters _ made 32 surprise visits, the highest since they
returned to Baghdad last month.
	   Baghdad did not hide its anger as the weapons inspectors speeded
up their probe. State-run newspapers quoted Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz, currently on a visit to Moscow, as saying there was a
limit to Iraq's compliance.
	   Iraq has been cooperating with the U.N. inspectors for more than
seven years but has yet to see an end to economic sanctions, Aziz
was quoted as saying.
	   ``This situation is no longer acceptable,'' he said.
	   The sanctions, imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait,
cannot be lifted until the weapons inspectors certify that Iraq is
free of chemical, nuclear and biological weapons and long-range
missiles.
	   Late Monday, Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf said a
team of 39 inspectors had arrived in Iraq, and branded them
``commandos'' trying to create problems. But Ms. Cross, the
inspectors' spokeswoman, denied a new team had come.
	   ``There is no reason for the Iraqis to worry if they are going
to comply,'' she said.
	   There are now about 140 U.N. weapons experts stationed in
Baghdad, in addition ``to several visiting teams,'' she said.
	   On Tuesday, nine arms monitoring groups, two biological warfare
teams and a missile unit conducted 32 searches, using helicopters
and vehicles, the Iraqi News Agency said.
	   The inspectors resumed their work last month after a nearly
three-month period during which Iraq had banned them from visiting
any new suspected weapons sites. Iraq reversed that ban and pledged
full cooperation on Nov. 14, as the United States and Britain were
preparing to launch military strikes.
	   Ms. Cross refused to characterize Tuesday's inspections as
``surprise,'' calling them the ``usual hard work.''
	   However, chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler had said
earlier that a series of surprise visits would begin Tuesday in a
final test of Baghdad's pledge of cooperation.
	   He said the unannounced checks will finish late this week or
early next week. After that, he will report to U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan whether Iraq is making good on its
promise to cooperate.
	   Annan will pass the assessment on to the U.N. Security Council,
which must decide whether there is room for starting a
comprehensive review of Iraq's compliance with U.N. resolutions.
	   Iraq hopes the review will lead to lifting the sanctions _ a
move the United States and Britain have not been willing to
guarantee.

Endeavour gives new space station a safe but shaky lift

	   SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) _ With the bulk of their construction
work behind them, Endeavour's astronauts gave the new
up-and-running space station a safe but shaky lift to a higher
orbit on Tuesday.
	   The pilots fired the shuttle thrusters to climb to an altitude
of about 248 miles, 5{ miles higher than before. They'll soar even
higher on Friday.
	   NASA wants to leave the international space station in as high
an orbit as possible. Spacecraft gradually sink because of the
naturally occurring drag of the atmosphere, and need to be boosted
periodically.
	   The seven-story, 35-ton station swung a foot back and forth in
Endeavour's cargo bay, its solar wings flapping, as the shuttle
moved higher and higher. The astronauts kept close watch on the
quivering stack during the 20-minute ride.
	   ``Nice job,'' Mission Control said. Shuttle commander Robert
Cabana replied that the boosting procedure ``really worked slick.''
	   After the previous night's 7{-hour spacewalk to wire the Zarya
and Unity station modules together, the astronauts took it easy
Tuesday. It was their first break since rocketing into orbit last
Friday.
	   Flight controllers took up the slack, monitoring all systems
aboard the space station. Unity, the American-made side, came to
life for the first time in orbit late Monday after spacewalkers
hooked up 40 electrical connections.
	   The Unity connecting chamber was right around the freezing point
when its heaters kicked on. The 36-foot cylinder should be warm
enough by the time the six shuttle astronauts venture inside on
Thursday, said NASA's lead flight director, Bob Castle. The
astronauts will spruce up Unity and Zarya, and drop off clothes for
the first permanent crew, due to arrive in early 2000.
	   Unity's fans and computers also were purring.
	   ``We put the skeleton together of the beginnings of the space
station'' on Sunday, Castle said after power and data began flowing
between Unity and Zarya. ``Today we hooked up the first parts of
the nervous system.''
	   Unlike the Russian-built Zarya control module, which gets its
energy from the sun, Unity lacks solar wings and so must rely on
Zarya for power. Unity also lacks a communication system, but not
for long.
	   Spacewalkers Jerry Ross and James Newman will go out again
Wednesday to attach two 100-pound antennas to Unity. That way, NASA
won't have to rely on Russia's Mission Control to communicate with
the segment.
	   A third and final spacewalk is set for Saturday.

	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Francesco Totti made sure of AS
Roma's place in the UEFA Cup quarterfinals Tuesday, scoring with a
free kick in second-half injury time after FC Zurich had gone 2-1
ahead on the night.
	   Marco Delvecchio put Roma 1-0 ahead in the 14th minute of the
third-round, second-leg tie.
	   Zurich's South African striker Shaun Bartlett missed a
second-half penalty but then scored twice to give the Swiss side
hope of an upset.
	   Zurich keeper Ike Shorunmu kept out Roma during a hectic opening
period, but had no chance against Delvecchio's left-footed strike
in the 14th minute.
	   The Swiss team came back into the match, but missed chances to
get back on level teams on a freezing, slippery pitch at the
Letzigrund stadium.
	   Zurich was awarded a penalty shortly after the interval when
midfielder Franco di Jorio was brought down.
	   But Bartlett's weak penalty kick was easily saved by Roma keeper
Antonio Chimenti.
	   Bartlett made amends in the 60th minute, equalizing for Zurich
with a powerful header from a free kick.
	   Roma's Brazilian striker Paulo Sergio drew an acrobatic save
from Shorunmu with a header before Bartlett stunned Roma in the
79th minute, sidestepping a challenge by Chimenti to score his
second goal.
	   Totti restored Roma's aggregate advantage in the 92nd minute,
curling a free kick past the Zurich defense.
	   Roma has the best attack in the Italian league and is tied for
second place in the standings. But Zurich was unlucky to lose to an
injury-time Totti penalty in the first leg.
	   Some 15,200 fans turned out for the match.

Marseille wins all-French battle with 1-0 victory over Monaco
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ Titi Camara struck a 70th minute goal
to give Marseille a 1-0 win against Monaco on Tuesday, and a 3-2
aggregate success in the first ever UEFA Cup tie between two French
teams.
	   In front of 55,000 fans at the Stade Velodrome, a frantic but
absorbing game saw Monaco centerback Mohamed Konjic sent off in the
38th minute.
	   The winning goal after Jocelyn Gourvennec played a smart ball to
Camara in the penalty box.
	   The Guyanan-born striker used his burly frame to swivel around
Bruno Irles and smash the ball past Fabien Barthez with a 10-meter
(yard) left foot shot.
	   Monaco never threatened after being reduced to ten men.
	   Robert Pires, finding space in a congested center circle, played
a fine diagonal pass through the Monaco defense to Christophe
Dugarry, whose ankles were clipped by Konjic.
	   Referee Piero Ceccarini had little choice but to show the red
card.
	   Six players have now been sent off in the last eight matches
between the teams, including a total of three over the two-legged
UEFA Cup tie.
	   Even before the sending off, Marseille was on top.
	   French World Cup goalkeeper Barthez had to keep the visitors in
the tie with a string of fine saves from Dugarry, Pires and Daniel
Bravo.
	   Inside the first five minute, Monaco left back Christophe Pignol
skewed a clearance, putting Dugarry in a great position behind the
Monaco defense, but Barthez saved well with his legs.
	   In the 11th minute, Pires lofted a cross to Bravo, whose
thundering left foot drive was brilliantly tipped around the post
by Barthez.
	   Dugarry was again well-placed to score in the 17th minute, but
Philippe Christanval did well to block his shot.
	   Dugarry did better in the 24th minute with a powerful snap shot
from 25 meters (yards) that was beaten out by Barthez.

The new NATO must go beyond its immediate borders
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS lede; UPDATES with Albright quotes on nuclear issue;
TRIMS; No Pickup &QL; 
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright dismissed as ``hogwash'' Tuesday suggestions that a move
by NATO to take action outside its borders amounted to changing the
organization's charter.
	   ``We are neither altering the North Atlantic Treaty nor
attempting to create some kind of a new `global NATO,''' she said.
``What we are doing is using the flexibility the treaty always
offered to adapt this alliance to the realities of a new strategic
environment...''
	   Speaking to fellow NATO foreign ministers, Albright called for
NATO to address threats outside the borders of the 16-nation
alliance.
	   The meeting of ministers was a precursor to NATO's April 24-25
summit in Washington. Also attending the meeting were ministers
from Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, which will become
members next year.
	   One of the main summit issues will be updating NATO's strategic
concept, the military and political principles that define its
mission. In practice, that means updating theory to reflect what
NATO has been doing for years.
	   With the fall of the Berlin wall and the end of the Warsaw Pact,
the alliance has moved away from its strategy of defending against
a massive tank attack across Central Europe to new challenges such
as regional conflicts, ethnic violence, terrorism and the spread of
weapons of mass destruction.
	   ``We must be prepared because we know that events beyond NATO's
immediate borders can affect vital alliance interests,'' Albright
said. ``This is why we acted in Bosnia. This is why we have come
together to prevent renewed violence in Kosovo.
	   Albright rejected suggestions by some critics that taking on
those new missions would undermine NATO's original intent.
	   ``I've said it before; I will repeat it again today: This is
hogwash,'' she said.
	   The central mission of NATO will always be collective defense,
but that doesn't preclude new missions, she said.
	   ``One of the special qualities of the alliance has always been
its ability to react flexibly to new situations,'' said German
Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer.
	   Fischer made waves when he called on NATO last month to consider
dropping its doctrine allowing a nuclear first-strike. The doctrine
has always been a part of NATO's nuclear strategy and is considered
an important aspect of deterrence.
	   Albright dismissed the suggestion.
	   ``The strategy was changed in 1991 and was reaffirmed as
recently as last year,'' she said at a news conference. ``So we do
not believe a review is necessary. We have the right nuclear
strategy. I think we all felt pretty comfortable with where we
are.''
	   France, another of the alliance's three nuclear powers, also was
unenthusiastic.
	   ``Our country has nothing against arms reduction,'' said French
Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine. ``At the same time, nuclear
deterrents tend to be considered in France as having helped
preserve peace.''
	   The ministers also deplored the continued violence in Kosovo,
where sporadic killings keep puncturing a shaky cease-fire between
Serb security forces and ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent
of the population.
	   The ministers also agreed that the NATO-led multinational
peacekeeping force in Bosnia should be left at its current
32,000-troop level. A final decision will be made by defense
ministers at their meeting next week.

U.N. intensifies hunt for Iraq's illegal arms

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with details of 32 searches, some in helicopters; no
pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. inspection teams launched a series of
surprise searches Tuesday for banned Iraqi weapons despite angry
assertions from Baghdad that the searches amount to harassment.
	   ``We are undertaking a very intensive schedule,'' said Caroline
Cross, the spokeswoman in Baghdad for the U.N. Special Commission,
which oversees the inspections. ``We have several teams in town. We
need to test Iraq's pledge to comply.''
	   The official Iraqi News Agency said the inspectors _ some using
helicopters _ made 32 surprise visits, the highest since they
returned to Baghdad last month.
	   Baghdad did not hide its anger as the weapons inspectors speeded
up their probe. State-run newspapers quoted Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz, currently on a visit to Moscow, as saying there was a
limit to Iraq's compliance.
	   Iraq has been cooperating with the U.N. inspectors for more than
seven years but has yet to see an end to economic sanctions, Aziz
was quoted as saying.
	   ``This situation is no longer acceptable,'' he said.
	   The sanctions, imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait,
cannot be lifted until the weapons inspectors certify that Iraq is
free of chemical, nuclear and biological weapons and long-range
missiles.
	   Late Monday, Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf said a
team of 39 inspectors had arrived in Iraq, and branded them
``commandos'' trying to create problems. But Ms. Cross, the
inspectors' spokeswoman, denied a new team had come.
	   ``There is no reason for the Iraqis to worry if they are going
to comply,'' she said.
	   There are now about 140 U.N. weapons experts stationed in
Baghdad, in addition ``to several visiting teams,'' she said.
	   On Tuesday, nine arms monitoring groups, two biological warfare
teams and a missile unit conducted 32 searches, using helicopters
and vehicles, the Iraqi News Agency said.
	   The inspectors resumed their work last month after a nearly
three-month period during which Iraq had banned them from visiting
any new suspected weapons sites. Iraq reversed that ban and pledged
full cooperation on Nov. 14, as the United States and Britain were
preparing to launch military strikes.
	   Ms. Cross refused to characterize Tuesday's inspections as
``surprise,'' calling them the ``usual hard work.''
	   However, chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler had said
earlier that a series of surprise visits would begin Tuesday in a
final test of Baghdad's pledge of cooperation.
	   He said the unannounced checks will finish late this week or
early next week. After that, he will report to U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan whether Iraq is making good on its
promise to cooperate.
	   Annan will pass the assessment on to the U.N. Security Council,
which must decide whether there is room for starting a
comprehensive review of Iraq's compliance with U.N. resolutions.
	   Iraq hopes the review will lead to lifting the sanctions _ a
move the United States and Britain have not been willing to
guarantee.

Italy's Parma, Bologna, Roma reach UEFA Cup quarterfinals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Italy pushed three clubs into the UEFA Cup
quarterfinals on Tuesday _ Parma, Bologna and Roma _ and is again
poised to capture a trophy it has won seven of the last 10 seasons.
	   In other quarterfinals, Spain's Celta ousted Liverpool, French
side Lyon eliminated FC Brugge of Belgium, and another French team
Bordeaux put out Zurich on away goals.
	   In late matches, Monaco played at Marseille after a 2-2 draw in
the first leg, and in a Spanish showdown, Atletico Madrid hosted
Real Sociedad with the Basques holding a 2-1 lead after the first
leg two weeks ago.
	   In Parma, Italy, Parma reached the quarterfinals with a 3-1
victory, going through on a 4-2 aggregate over Scotland's Glasgow
Rangers. The Italians _ 1995 UEFA Cup champions _ preserved a
four-year unbeaten home streak in European games on second-half
goals by Abel Balbo, Stefano Fiore and Enrico Chiesa.
	   Rangers took a 1-0 lead on a goal in the 28th by German
midfielder Jorg Albertz. Parma's second-half rally was made easier
by the expulsion of Rangers' Italian defender Sergio Porrini in the
45th.
	   In Seville, Spain, Bologna moved into the quarterfinals on a 4-2
aggregate despite losing to Spain's Betis 1-0. Oliverio Alvarez
scored for Betis in the fourth minute for the only goal of the
match after the Spaniards _ coached by former national coach Javier
Clemente _ were hammered 4-1 in the first leg two weeks ago in
Italy. Alvarez scored on a shot initially deflected by Bologna
goalkeeper Francesco Antonioli.
	   In Zurich, Switzerland, Francesco Totti made sure of AS Roma's
place in the quarterfinals, scoring with a free kick in second-half
injury to draw 2-2 against FC Zurich and advance 3-2 on aggregate.
Marco Delvecchio gave Roma a 1-0 lead in the 14th. Zurich's South
African striker Shaun Bartlett missed a second-half penalty but
then scored twice to give the Swiss side hope of an upset before
Totti scored.
	   In Brugge, Belgium, captain Alain Caveglia scored three goals as
France's Olympique Lyon defeated Belgian champion FC Brugge 4-3,
leading the French side to its first UEFA Cup quarterfinal in 30
years. Lyon advanced on a 5-3 aggregate. The winning goal came in
the 76th minute by Vikash Dhorasoo with the match tied 3-3. Tjorren
De Brul, Olivier De Cock and Anic Darco scored for Brugge.
	   In Bordeaux, France, Bordeaux played a scoreless draw with Swiss
side Grasshoppers, sending the French league leader through to the
last eight on away goals. The first leg in Zurich ended 3-3.
Bordeaux, which reached the UEFA Cup final 1996 with a team
inspired by Zinedine Zidane, controlled most of the match but
failed to break down a Swiss team content to play on the break.
	   Grasshoppers advanced to the third round by default after
Italy's Fiorentina, its second-round opponent, was expelled after
an Italian spectator hurled an explosive device on to the pitch.
	   In Liverpool, England, Spain's Celta Vigo added to Liverpool's
mounting woes as Haim Revivo scored in the 57th minute for a 1-0
victory, advancing the Spaniards 4-1 on aggregate. The Israeli
international scored as he broke down the left side and then cut in
front of the box and beat David James on a low shot from 10 meters
(yards).
	   The loss was Liverpool's fifth in seven matches as the famed
English side _ twice winners of the UEFA Cup and four-time European
Champions Cup winners _ was out-passed and out-played by the
quick-moving Spanish team.

Mandela discusses dlrs 1.5 billion arms deal with Saudi
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ South African President Nelson
Mandela and Saudi King Fahd discussed a deal Tuesday to sell arms
worth dlrs 1.5 billion to this oil-rich state, diplomats said.
	   The two countries have been negotiating the agreement to sell
motorized artillery pieces and anti-aircraft weapons for more than
a year, diplomats who attended the meeting said.
	   They spoke on condition of anonymity. No other details of the
talks were available.
	   Mandela arrived earlier Tuesday from the United Arab Emirates
where he attended the opening of the Gulf Cooperation Council
summit. Mandela and U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan were the
first leaders outside the group to attend the annual GCC summit,
which first met in 1981.
	   GCC comprises Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, UAE, Oman, Qatar and
Bahrain.
	   The official Saudi Press Agency said Mandela and Fahd
``discussed bilateral relations and ways of strengthening them.''
	   The meeting was attended by Saudi ambassador to the United
States, Bandar bin Sultan, who is considered the architect of
Saudi-South African relations.
	   Mandela was accompanied by South African Foreign Minister Alfred
Nzo, Saudi officials said.
	   Economic relations between the two nations have been growing in
recent years. South Africa hopes the increasing ties will lessen
its reliance on Iran for oil, from which it imports more than
two-thirds of its crude oil needs, according to South African press
reports.
	   During a visit to Saudi Arabia last year, Mandela signed a
tentative agreement on importing 15,000 barrels a day from Saudi
Arabia.
	   Bilateral trade has risen dramatically since the two countries
restored relations in 1994.
	   South Africa's exports to Saudi Arabia more than doubled from
dlrs 47 million in 1994 to dlrs 95 million in 1996. Saudi Arabia's
exports, mainly oil, jumped from dlrs 8 million in 1994 to dlrs 207
million in 1996.
	   Last year, their total trade was dlrs 450 million.

McGwire's 70th homer ball to be put up for bidding
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The chase for Mark McGwire's 70th home run ball
is in full swing _ with the winner to be decided in an auction.
	   The historic ball will be sold early next month by the New York
auction house Guernsey's.
	   Philip Ozersky, a 26-year-old research lab scientist at
Washington University in St. Louis, retrieved the ball Sept. 27 as
McGwire's St. Louis Cardinals ended the regular season against
Montreal.
	   ``They know how to pull off an auction of this size,'' Michael
Freedland, the Fort Lauderdale lawyer who represents Ozersky, told
The New York Times. ``And they're going to do an online auction
simultaneously.''
	   Three collectors, represented by St. Louis attorney Alan Cohen,
have offered dlrs 1 million for the ball, and Freedland estimated
Ozersky has received more than 500 inquiries. The ball has been
displayed at the Cardinals' Hall of Fame for about two months.
	   The Times said Guernsey's also will auction other available
homer balls hit by McGwire and the Chicago Cubs' Sammy Sosa.
	   McGwire's 62nd home run ball _ the homer that broke Roger Maris'
1961 record _ is at the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New
York.

Doctor guilty of supervising HIV-tainted blood to hemophiliacs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ A Red Cross doctor was found guilty Tuesday in
Switzerland of supervising the distribution of HIV-infected blood
products to hemophiliacs and was given a one-year suspended prison
sentence.
	   A Geneva court ruled that Alfred Haessig, the 77-year-old former
director of the Swiss central laboratory of the Red Cross, put
people at risk through his actions in the 1980s, and said he had
acted out of ``pride and stubbornness.''
	   The case was brought after official complaints were made by
eight infected Swiss hemophiliacs, four of whom have since died.
	   District Attorney Bernard Bertossa said that as a scientist
Haessig would have been aware starting in 1982 there was a risk
blood products could transmit the AIDS virus.
	   But Haessig continued to supervise the manufacture of the blood
products until November 1985 and the distribution of them until the
May 1986, Bertossa said. Safer options existed but he failed to use
them, the prosecution argued.
	   Haessig admitted that he had not used pasteurization because he
had believed it was less efficient in treating hemophiliacs.
	   ``I did nothing wrong, but certain things could have been done
better,'' Haessig told the court.
	   Haessig retired in 1987.
	   Among the victims were brothers Miguel and Francisco Fernandez,
who gave a statement before their deaths in 1994 and 1995 that they
had never been warned of the danger from the blood products.
	   ``We needed it. We had no choice. You have to have confidence in
doctors,'' they said.
	   The Red Cross laboratory provided 80 percent of the blood
products for hemophiliacs in Switzerland at the time of the
contamination. Doctors told the court that they had thought the Red
Cross products were particularly good, describing the Swiss mark as
``a label of quality.''
	   The laboratory issued a statement after the verdict expressing
deep regret about the distribution of tainted products, which it
said was ``one of the greatest human tragedies of our time.''
	   The Swiss Red Cross also expressed regret over the infections.
	   The three-judge panel cleared Haessig of a charge of grievous
bodily harm.

	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Francesco Totti made sure of AS
Roma's place in the UEFA Cup quarterfinals Tuesday, scoring with a
free kick in second-half injury time after FC Zurich had gone 2-1
ahead on the night.
	   Marco Delvecchio put Roma 1-0 ahead in the 14th minute of the
third-round, second-leg tie.
	   Zurich's South African striker Shaun Bartlett missed a
second-half penalty but then scored twice to give the Swiss side
hope of an upset.
	   Zurich keeper Ike Shorunmu kept out Roma during a hectic opening
period, but had no chance against Delvecchio's left-footed strike
in the 14th minute.
	   The Swiss team came back into the match, but missed chances to
get back on level teams on a freezing, slippery pitch at the
Letzigrund stadium.
	   Zurich was awarded a penalty shortly after the interval when
midfielder Franco di Jorio was brought down.
	   But Bartlett's weak penalty kick was easily saved by Roma keeper
Antonio Chimenti.
	   Bartlett made amends in the 60th minute, equalizing for Zurich
with a powerful header from a free kick.
	   Roma's Brazilian striker Paulo Sergio drew an acrobatic save
from Shorunmu with a header before Bartlett stunned Roma in the
79th minute, sidestepping a challenge by Chimenti to score his
second goal.
	   Totti restored Roma's aggregate advantage in the 92nd minute,
curling a free kick past the Zurich defense.
	   Roma has the best attack in the Italian league and is tied for
second place in the standings. But Zurich was unlucky to lose to an
injury-time Totti penalty in the first leg.
	   Some 15,200 fans turned out for the match.

Clinton survival strategy keyed to contrition, GOP moderates
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With US-Clinton-Impeachment &QL; 
 &UR; By TERENCE HUNT &QC; 
 &UR; AP White House Correspondent &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Admit wrongdoing and deception. Be contrite.
Avoid confrontation. Raise the alarm to Americans that Congress is
about to ignore public sentiment with a momentous step toward
impeaching the president for sex and lies.
	   Above all, reach out to moderate Republicans who hold the key to
deciding the nation's historic impeachment drama.
	   Those were the main ingredients of President Bill Clinton's
survival strategy Tuesday as the House Judiciary Committee opened
the final stage of its inquiry into allegations of perjury,
obstruction of justice and abuse of power growing out of Clinton's
affair with Monica Lewinsky.
	   It is considered a foregone conclusion that the
Republican-dominated committee will approve at least one article of
impeachment in the next few days. That will set up a dramatic vote
in the full, 435-member House on whether Clinton will be only the
second president in history to be impeached and tried in the
Senate.
	   The House is expected to vote largely along party lines, and
Republicans hold a 22-member edge over Democrats, which requires a
switch of 11 votes to alter a party-line outcome. The White House
is targeting a group of about 30 moderate GOP lawmakers, hoping to
find enough members uneasy with impeachment to break ranks with
conservative leaders and kill the process.
	   With that group in mind, White House counsel Gregory Craig
acknowledged to the Judiciary Committee that Clinton's disputed
testimony last January was ``evasive, incomplete, misleading, even
maddening.'' But Craig argued it did not amount to perjury or rise
to the level of impeachment.
	   The testimony was intended to answer criticism that Clinton was
not really taking responsibility for wrongdoing and that a smug
White House was acting like the impeachment battle was over.
	   Clinton had angered Republicans and Democrats alike with highly
legalistic answers to 81 questions from the Judiciary Committee;
the White House scrambled to undo that damage.
	   ``We had to come out and say that he didn't tell the truth, the
whole truth, and he was misleading,'' one White House official
said.
	   White House officials also let it be known that Clinton had
instructed his representatives not to be confrontational and
directed that their testimony be changed to make clear he is deeply
sorry and accepts responsibility.
	   The administration is waiting to see how the contrition strategy
works. If that's not enough, officials hold out the possibility
that Clinton himself will address the subject again.
	   Even with the White House's new soft-spoken manner, there was a
taste of the combative approach that marked much of the last 11
months.
	   Princeton historian Sean Wilentz, testifying for the White
House, riled some Republican members by asserting that an
impeachment vote would put lawmakers at risk of ``going down in
history with the zealots and the fanatics.''
	   To those who are unsure about the charges but vote to impeach
anyway, he said, ``History will track you down and condemn you for
your cravenness.''
	   The White House and its allies are banking on the belief that
Americans, preoccupied by their own lives and the holidays, are
going to be stunned that Republicans are still waging an
impeachment fight.
	   Wasn't that battle decided by Republican losses in the November
elections? Besides, the polls show that only about 30 percent of
Americans favor impeachment. Democrats warned that a Senate trial
would prolong the case by six months to a year more.
	   ``There isn't a great groundswell out there to have this hearing
and go forward with an impeachment,,'' said American University
political scientist James Thurber. ``It is somewhat of an inside
game here.''
	   The White House hopes the House will end the issue with a
censure vote against Clinton, or a censure vote accompanied by a
fine. The administration's line is: make an offer, we'll take a
look at it.
	   Even a financial punishment looks more attractive now amid
speculation that Clinton is losing ground and a House vote to
impeach is more likely.
	   When the House voted in September to open its inquiry, ``They
set in motion a runaway train and they've had no brakes to bring it
to a halt,'' said American Enterprise Institute scholar Norm
Ornstein.
	   ``I think it can be stopped but it's probably not going to be by
an act by the president,'' Ornstein said. ``It's going to be a
group of centrist Republicans going to Bob Livingston (the incoming
speaker) and saying, `You've got to intervene here.' The odds of
that are not huge now.''

Cyclone Thelma skirts north coast, no major destruction on land
</HEADLINE>
yet &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   DARWIN, Australia (AP) _ Cyclone Thelma continued to churn its
way across the coast off the northern tip of Australia on Wednesday
after lashing the Tiwi Islands off the Northern Territory coast
with gale-force winds.
	   Police said intense gale-force winds, reaching speeds of up to
125 mph (200 kph), ripped through the region overnight but so far
emergency personnel had only received reports of minor structural
damage.
	   ``It was an intense night, there were a lot of trees ripped out,
building structural damage and a few power lines down,'' a police
spokesman said.
	   The Bureau of Meteorology said the slow moving category five
cyclone was now heading toward the Western Australian coast.

Polgar, Karpov match in question, Polgar vs Kasparov likely
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ The Las Vegas ``battle of the sexes''
match between chess champions Anatoly Karpov and Zsuzsa Polgar is
off for now for lack of funds, the state-run news agency MTI
reported Tuesday.
	   ``Until the prize money has been placed with a lawyer, there is
no sense discussing a match,'' said Laszlo Polgar, the
father-manager of the three Polgar grandmasters, denying earlier
reports of a dlrs 300,000 tournament in Las Vegas this month.
	   Karpov, 47, is the reigning champion of the World Chess
Federation, known by its French acronym FIDE. Zsuzsa Polgar, 29, is
the reigning world women's champion.
	   She became a grandmaster in 1991 and once beat Karpov, the
world's fifth-ranked player.
	   Her sister, Judit, 21, the world's top female chess player,
defeated Karpov in June in Budapest.
	   Laszlo Polgar said Judit will likely play against Garry Kasparov
next year, but did not specify any details.
	   The third Polgar daughter, Zsofia, is also among the world's top
20 female chess players. Zsofia is one year younger than Judit.

Italy, France advance three to UEFA Cup quarterfinals

Atletico-Real Sociedad match &QL;

 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Italy and France will dominate the UEFA Cup
quarterfinals as three clubs from each country reached the final
eight on Tuesday.
	   For Italy _ with Parma, Bologna and Roma advancing _ it's
nothing new. Italian teams have won the cup seven of the last 10
seasons with Inter Milan the holders.
	   France advanced Lyon, Bordeaux and Marseille.
	   In the other two quarterfinals, Spain's Celta ousted Liverpool
4-1 on aggregate. In a late match, Spanish sides Atletico Madrid
and Real Sociedad played for the final place with the Basques
holding a 2-1 edge after the first leg two weeks ago.
	   Italian success is synonymous with the UEFA Cup. In addition to
seven of the last 10 titles, Italian club have featured in nine of
those 10 finals.
	   In Parma, Italy, Parma reached the quarterfinals with a 3-1
victory, going through on a 4-2 aggregate over Scotland's Glasgow
Rangers. The Italians _ 1995 UEFA Cup champions _ preserved a
four-year unbeaten home streak in European games on second-half
goals by Abel Balbo, Stefano Fiore and Enrico Chiesa. Rangers took
a 1-0 lead on a goal in the 28th by German midfielder Jorg Albertz.
Parma's second-half rally was helped when Rangers' Italian defender
Sergio Porrini was expelled in the 45th.
	   In Seville, Spain, Bologna moved into the quarterfinals on a 4-2
aggregate despite losing to Spain's Betis 1-0. Oliverio Alvarez
scored for Betis in the fourth minute for the only goal of the
match after the Spaniards _ coached by former national coach Javier
Clemente _ were hammered 4-1 in the first leg two weeks ago in
Italy.
	   In Zurich, Switzerland, Francesco Totti made sure of AS Roma's
place in the quarterfinals, scoring with a free kick in second-half
injury to draw 2-2 against FC Zurich and advance 3-2 on aggregate.
Marco Delvecchio gave Roma a 1-0 lead in the 14th. Zurich's South
African striker Shaun Bartlett missed a second-half penalty but
then scored twice to give the Swiss side hope of an upset before
Totti scored.
	   In Brugge, Belgium, captain Alain Caveglia scored three goals as
France's Olympique Lyon defeated Belgian champion FC Brugge 4-3,
leading the French side to its first UEFA Cup quarterfinal in 30
years. Lyon advanced on a 5-3 aggregate. The winning goal came in
the 76th minute by Vikash Dhorasoo with the match tied 3-3. Tjorren
De Brul, Olivier De Cock and Anic Darco scored for Brugge.
	   In Bordeaux, France, Bordeaux played a scoreless draw with Swiss
side Grasshoppers, sending the French league leader through to the
last eight on away goals. The first leg in Zurich ended 3-3.
Bordeaux controlled most of the match but failed to break down a
Swiss team content to play on the break. Grasshoppers advanced to
the third round by default after Italy's Fiorentina, its
second-round opponent, was expelled after an Italian spectator
hurled an explosive device on to the pitch.
	   In Marseille, France, Titi Camara got a 70th-minute goal to give
Marseille a 1-0 win over Monaco and advance 3-2 in the first ever
UEFA Cup tie between two French teams. The winning goal came after
Jocelyn Gourvennec played a smart ball to Camara in the penalty
box. The Guyanan-born striker used his burly frame to swivel around
Bruno Irles and smash the ball past Fabien Barthez with a 10-meter
(yard) left foot shot. Monaco centerback Mohamed Konjic was sent
off in the 38th minute and Monaco never threatened after that.
	   In Liverpool, England, Spain's Celta added to Liverpool's
mounting woes as Haim Revivo scored in the 57th minute for a 1-0
victory, advancing the Spaniards 4-1 on aggregate. The Israeli
international scored as he broke down the left side and then cut in
front of the box and beat David James on a low shot from 10 meters
(yards). The loss was Liverpool's fifth in seven matches as the
famed English side _ twice winners of the UEFA Cup and four-time
European Champions Cup winners _ was out-passed and out-played by
the quick-moving Spanish team.

ACB confirms pair took money, deny bribes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: Updates with latest quotes from Speed on Wednesday; adds
comment from Pakistani adviser &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Australian Cricket Board (ACB) chief
executive Malcolm Speed confirmed Wednesday that Australian test
cricketers Mark Waugh and Shane Warne were fined for selling
information to an Indian bookmaker.
	   But Waugh and Warne were not involved in bribery or
match-fixing, Speed said.
	   The ACB has revealed it fined the high-profile pair a total of
18,000 Australian dollars (11,500 US dlrs) for selling weather and
pitch reports to the bookmaker during the 1994 tour of Sri Lanka
and Pakistan.
	   Sydney's The Telegraph newspaper said the pair were fined by the
then ACB chief executive Graham Halbish for selling the information
to a millionaire Madras bookmaker during the 1994 one-day
tournament in Sri Lanka.
	   The Australian newspaper reported that the fines were imposed in
February 1995, the same month it became public that Warne and Waugh
had been offered 200,000 US dlrs each to play poorly on the tour of
Pakistan _ an offer they rejected.
	   Waugh was reportedly fined 10,000 Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs
6,400) and Warne 8,000 Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 5,100) for
selling the information to the bookmaker.
	   Speed said Wednesday the incident was damaging to Australian
cricket but that the ACB had dealt with the matter effectively. He
said he did not know why the ACB had not revealed the fines
earlier.
	   ``It was dealt with quite effectively by the Australian Cricket
Board in that it was investigated quickly, the players came forward
and fully admitted their involvement ... fines were imposed, the
fines were paid,'' Speed said.
	   ``There's no suggestion of bribery or match fixing.
	   ``As far as the Australian Cricket Board is concerned that's the
end of the matter.''
	   Waugh refused to answer questions on Tuesday, telling The
Australian: ``I don't know where you got your information from, I
don't know if that's right.''
	   Australia's 1994 tour of Pakistan has become notorious for
charges of match-fixing and bribery leveled against then Pakistani
captain Salim Malik.
	   Waugh, Warne and former player Tim May had accused Malik of
attempting to bribe them. Malik has protested his innocence.
	   Justice Malik Mohammad Qayyum is due to submit his report on the
match-fixing scandal to Pakistan president Mohammad Rafiq Tarar in
the next two weeks.
	   Ali Sibtain Fazli, a legal adviser to the Pakistan Cricket
Board, said Wednesday that evidence given to the inquiry in
Pakistan by Waugh and Australian Test captain Mark Taylor was now
questionable.
	   ``Mark Waugh and Taylor should've made some mention of it
because they were made to give statements on oath. There should
have been disclosures then,'' Fazli told Australian Broadcasting
Corp. radio.
	   Speed said Waugh and Warne would now be open to accusations of
double standards.
	   ``Both players are very disappointed with their behavior at the
time, they look back on that, they hope that the subject is put
behind them,'' he said.
	   Leg spinner Warne, 29, made his test debut against India in
1991-92 in Sydney, and has toured the sub-continent four times.
	   Warne has taken 308 test wickets at 24.10 to rank among the
all-time great bowlers, but shoulder surgery in April after this
year's tour in India has so far stopped him returning to the test
side.
	   In his autobiography Warne wrote: ``The whole betting scene in
India and Pakistan is illegal so the people running the betting are
basically gangsters. Not the sort of people to trust or play around
with.''
	   Waugh, the twin of vice-captain Steve Waugh, made his debut in
1990-91 against England in Adelaide.
	   The 33-year-old has been a mainstay of Australia's middle order
in 80 test matches, making more than 5,000 runs, averaging around
43.

Report: North Korea building three underground launch facilities
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ North Korea has begun developing three underground
facilities capable of launching ballistic missiles, Japan's public
broadcasting network reported Tuesday.
	   U.S. spy satellites have confirmed what appear to be three
missile-launch bases under construction in the northern part of
North Korea, NHK television quoted Japanese Defense Agency sources
as saying.
	   The three facilities are being built at varying depths ranging
from 50 meters (165 feet) to 100 meters (330 feet) below ground,
the report said.
	   Hosei Norota, Director General of Japan's Defense Agency, said
at a news conference Tuesday that he has ``yet to receive such
information nor confirmed'' the report, an agency spokesman quoted
him as saying.
	   The report came as former U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry,
the newly appointed U.S. government policy coordinator for North
Korea, was on a three-nation Asian tour.
	   On Monday, Perry met South Korean President Kim Dae-jung in
Seoul. Kim proposed a ``package deal,'' in which the United States
would provide economic and diplomatic benefits to North Korea in
exchange for access to a suspected nuclear weapons site. Perry also
plans to visit Beijing and Tokyo this week.
	   Under a 1994 agreement with the United States, North Korea
agreed to abandon its suspected nuclear weapons program. In return,
it is to receive two safe nuclear reactors worth dlrs 4.6 billion
plus substitute fuel oil and other economic benefits.
	   The U.S. military believes it will be difficult for U.S.
intelligence satellites to monitor the North's underground missile
facilities if they are completed, NHK reported.
	   In Washington, U.S. State Department spokesman James Foley said
the administration has been aware of the report for several weeks.
	   ``We've noted on several previous occasions that North Korea's
missile proliferation activities are of serious concern to the
United States,'' Foley said.
	   He added that the United States is ``working closely with other
like-minded countries to curb the flow of missile equipment and
technology worldwide.''

	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ At least 15,000 people are isolated
and in need of immediate aid in northeastern Honduras more than a
month after Hurricane Mitch wiped out the area's roads and bridges,
religious and local leaders said Tuesday.
	   The U.N. World Food Program airlifted five tons of food Monday
to 10,000 people stranded along the banks of the Patuca River _ the
first aid the area had received.
	   ``These people are without communications, without homes,
without food or medicine,'' WFP spokesman Niurka Pinerio said.
	   No deaths in the area were reported but floodwaters have
destroyed an estimated 600 homes in the northeastern Olancho
province, the Rome-based group said.
	   ``The church is trying to help everyone, but the job is
difficult,'' said American Nicolas Schiel, a Catholic priest who
has worked in the northeastern Nueva Palestina parish for 12 years.
	   He said at least 15,000 people in 170 villages were in need of
aid,
	   Hurricane Mitch, which hit Honduras between Oct. 25 and Nov. 2,
flooded the banks of the Patuca River, destroying at least 15
villages in the provinces of Gracias a Dios and Olancho, the
government said. Because of mudslides, the region is accessible by
helicopter or boat.
	   ``We intend to rebuild the ground roads and the small bridges
damaged by Mitch, but we do not have the resources to do so,''
Nueva Palestina mayoral secretary Santos Obando said.
	   One of the top concerns was the lack of clean drinking water,
which could lead to disease outbreaks.
	   The World Food Program said it set up a food ``pipeline'' that
would make weekly boat deliveries to the region. The first shipment
left La Ceiba on Tuesday carrying 20 tons of corn, three tons of
canned fish and 100 boxes of vegetable oil.
	   Lucas Aguilera, leader of the National Association of Farm
Workers, warned that further help _ such as seeds _ would be needed
to help the victims restore their coffee, rice, corn and bean
crops.
	   More than 9,000 people across Central America were killed during
the hurricane, more than 5,600 in Honduras. Thousands of others
remain missing.
	   The government said Tuesday that 20 nations had donated dlrs 67
million in the month after the storm. President Carlos Flores
Facusse has said it will take dlrs 4 billion to rebuild the
country.
	   Taiwan's vice president, Lien Chan, arrived Tuesday in
Tegucigalpa to deliver a check for dlrs 12 million for the
hurricane victims.

Russia blocks action against Yugoslavia over war crimes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Russia blocked the U.N. Security Council
from taking action against Yugoslavia on Tuesday for hindering the
work of the war crimes tribunal.
	   Judge Gabrielle Kirk McDonald, president of the Yugoslav
tribunal, accused the government of President Slobodan Milosevic of
``unabashedly obstructing the explicit directives of the Security
Council.''
	   She asked the council to determine ``the appropriate measures''
to take against Belgrade, beyond its previous condemnation of
Yugoslavia's failure to cooperate with war crimes investigators and
demand for the arrest of the three men charged with organizing a
massacre.
	   But Russia, which has close religious and cultural ties to
Yugoslavia, blocked even a press statement from the council
president condemning Yugoslavia's latest failure to cooperate with
war crimes investigators, diplomats said, while speaking on
condition of anonymity.
	   McDonald said a decision last month by the president of the
Military Court in Belgrade to conduct an investigation of war
crimes at the Vukovar hospital in November 1991 was in direct
contravention of Security Council resolution and the tribunal,
which has primacy over national courts.
	   The Military Court president had even asked for the tribunal's
files on the three men that formed the basis of the tribunal's
indictment, she said.
	   The three Serbs sought by the tribunal _ Veselin Sljivancanin,
Miroslav Radic and Milan Mrksic _ are accused of ordering the
massacre of 261 Croats taken out of the hospital in Vukovar in
eastern Croatia.
	   The breakup of Yugoslavia sparked a civil war in 1991 that left
more than 10,000 dead and thousands missing before the 1995 Dayton
peace accords ended the fighting.
	   In her statement to the council, which was made public, McDonald
said the tribunal was at ``a critical juncture'' because of the
Yugoslav government's blatant refusal to cooperate.
	   ``I urge you not to allow the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia's
obstructionism to go unchecked for it sets a dangerous precedent,
one which even transcends its noncompliance,'' McDonald said.
	   For the moment the council took no action.
	   U.S. envoy Nancy Soderberg strongly condemned Belgrade's failure
to comply ``with its clear obligations under the requirements of
the tribunal.''
	   ``We believe the council should take appropriate action,''
Soderberg said, adding that she expected additional discussion in
the Security Council in the days and weeks ahead.
	   British Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock also denounced Belgrade's
``blatant and flagrant disregard of the council's resolutions.''
	   Yugoslavia, which consists of Serbia and Montenegro, has refused
to extradite its citizens sought by the tribunal, citing a
constitutional ban on extradition.

Tyson not talking about legal problems
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN NADEL &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES _ If Mike Tyson is concerned about a possible return
to prison, he wasn't saying Tuesday.
	   Looking fit in a black muscle T-shirt and wearing a crimson
beret, Tyson appeared for a news conference called to announce what
promoter Dan Goossen called the worst-kept secret in boxing _ that
Tyson will face Francois Botha on Jan. 16.
	   The 12-round bout at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, to be carried
on Showtime Event Television Pay Per View, will be Tyson's first
since June 28, 1997 when he bit Evander Holyfield's ears in their
heavyweight championship bout and was disqualified in the third
round.
	   Shortly thereafter, the Nevada Athletic Commission stripped
Tyson of his boxing license and fined him dlrs 3 million. The
commission reinstated Tyson's license in October.
	   Even before Tyson spoke at the packed Hollywood Athletic Club
news conference, adviser Shelly Finkel informed attending reporters
and fans that questions wouldn't be answered regarding ``any
pending litigation.''
	   The first questioner asked Tyson how he felt about a possible
return to prison, and was shouted down by others on the dais.
	   Appearing more relaxed and glib than usual, Tyson then responded
to questions _ sometimes with flippant, sarcastic answers, other
times with more thoughtful responses.
	   ``I'm not much for talking,'' he said in a one-minute
presentation before questions began. ``You guys know what I do. I
know no one believes that he (Botha) is going to beat me.''
	   Asked what round he'd stop Botha, he replied, ``Come to the
fight, brother.''
	   Another questioner asked about a possible future opponent, to
which Tyson replied, ``If the price is right, I'll fight a lion.''
	   He also said, ``I'm not here because I've been voted the nicest
guy in the world. I'm just here to give good fights, be a good
boy.''
	   And about the 30-year-old Botha, Tyson said, ``Let's be nice to
this guy, let's all be nice.''
	   Tyson has a 45-3 record with 39 knockouts, while Botha is 39-1
with 24 knockouts.
	   Botha's only loss came on Nov. 9, 1996 when he was stopped by
Michael Moorer in the ninth round for the IBF heavyweight title.
Botha has fought just twice this year, stopping two unheralded
opponents in the first round.
	   Earlier in the day in Indianapolis, the judge who could return
Tyson to prison said she will await his February sentencing on
Maryland assault charges before making a decision.
	   Judge Patricia Gifford followed a recommendation from probation
officer George Walker, who said in a probation report it ``may be
desirable to await the outcome'' of misdemeanor assault charges
against Tyson in Maryland.
	   Tyson pleaded no contest there last week. The Montgomery County
District Court in Maryland has set Feb. 5 for sentencing, said
James Voyles, Tyson's Indianapolis lawyer.
	   Tyson served three years for rape in Indiana, and Gifford will
decide whether he violated terms of his 1995 parole. Two motorists
said he kicked and punched them after an automobile accident in
Maryland in August.
	   ``Everyone knows I'm on parole, I'm trying to be nice up here,''
Tyson said during the news conference. ``I'm just here to fight,
one fight at a time. I don't want no trouble from anyone.''
	   Botha, pretty much shoved to the background, said he felt
honored to have the opportunity to face Tyson, an opportunity he
said he has been awaiting his entire life.
	   ``He's in for a rude awakening, that's all I can say,'' Botha
said. ``I come to fight, I don't come to lay down, and that's what
I intend to do.''
	   Following the news conference, Goossen, president of America
Presents, said it wasn't his job to concern himself with Tyson's
possible legal problems.
	   ``His lawyers are handling that,'' said Goosen, promoting a
Tyson fight for the first time. ``I'm a boxing promoter. My
energies have to go strictly toward the promotion.
	   ``I'm working toward Jan. 16, that's it. I don't think about it
one way or another. My answer is simply, we have to prepare for
Jan. 16.''
	   Goossen also said, ``Mike Tyson's the biggest act in show
business.''

Atletico Madrid beats Real Sociedad 4-1 to advance in UEFA Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Atletico Madrid scored twice in extra time
to post a 4-1 win Tuesday over Real Sociedad and advance to the
quarter finals of the UEFA Cup on a 5-3 aggregate.
	   At the end of regulation time the score was 2-1 _ the same
margin Real Sociedad won by two weeks ago in the Basque city of San
Sebastian.
	   The Madrid side wasted no time in putting Tuesday's game away.
	   Santiago Denia, or Santi, scored in the fourth minute of extra
time after recovering a header by teammate Jose Maria Romero right
in front of the goal.
	   A minute later Romero himself scored after racing down the left
side by himself and beating goalie Alberto Lopez.
	   Atletico Madrid had drawn first blood in the 17th minute with a
fabulous left-footed, overhead kick by Yugoslav midfielder Vladimir
Jugovic on a pass from Zoran Njegus.
	   In a play sure to make UEFA Cup highlight films, Jugovic tipped
the ball up to his chest, then quickly flipped it backwards and
sent it a meter over the head of stunned Real Sociedad goalkeeper
Alberto Lopez.
	   Jugovic converted a penalty one minute into first half injury
time after Mikel Antia was called for fouling Jordi Lardin. Jugovic
came up limping badly after his kick but kept playing in the second
half.
	   Real Sociedad made it 2-1 in the 50th minute as Xabier Gracia
evaded several defenders and put the ball just past Francisco Jose
Molina as the Atletico goalie came out to tackle him.
	   Rival fans fought outside Vicente Calderon Stadium hours before
the match. A 28-year-old Real Sociedad supporter was stabbed in the
chest as his girlfriend looked on.
	   The man was in intensive care after undergoing emergency heart
surgery, news reports said.

Celia Cruz says Christmas never should have left Cuba
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Cuban-born mambo queen Celia Cruz is happy to
see Christmas celebrations return to her homeland, saying Tuesday
that it is part of the country's Catholic identity.
	   ``Christmas never should have left Cuba because this is a thing
belonging to us Catholics. Certainly there is a minority of
non-Catholics, but even they carry the saint into the church. I
think that in Cuba we have all been Catholics,'' Cruz told
reporters in Mexico City.
	   Cuba announced last week that it would make Dec. 25 a permanent
holiday, reversing the 1969 abolition of Christmas on the communist
island.
	   Cruz, however, said that if she were still in Cuba, she would
not celebrate Christmas ``because no one tells me to celebrate.''

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Italy and France will have three clubs each in the
UEFA Cup quarterfinals, accompanied by Spanish sides Celta and
Atletico Madrid.
	   For Italy _ with Parma, Bologna and Roma advancing from the
third round, second leg on Tuesday _ it's nothing new. Italian
teams have won the cup seven of the last 10 seasons with Inter
Milan the holders.
	   Italian success is synonymous with the UEFA Cup. In addition to
seven of the last 10 titles, Italian club have featured in nine of
those 10 finals.
	   France advanced Lyon, Bordeaux and Marseille.
	   In the other two quarterfinals, Spain's Celta ousted Liverpool
4-1 on aggregate. In an all-Spanish showdown, Atletico Madrid beat
Real Sociedad 4-1 in extra time to advance 5-3. Atletico led 2-1
after regulation, forcing extra time with both clubs even on goals
and away goals.
	   In Parma, Italy, Parma reached the quarterfinals with a 3-1
victory, going through on a 4-2 aggregate over Scotland's Glasgow
Rangers. The Italians _ 1995 UEFA Cup champions _ preserved a
four-year unbeaten home streak in European games on second-half
goals by Abel Balbo, Stefano Fiore and Enrico Chiesa. Rangers took
a 1-0 lead on a goal in the 28th by German midfielder Jorg Albertz.
Parma's second-half rally was helped when Rangers' Italian defender
Sergio Porrini was expelled in the 45th.
	   In Seville, Spain, Bologna moved into the quarterfinals on a 4-2
aggregate despite losing to Spain's Betis 1-0. Oliverio Alvarez
scored for Betis in the fourth minute for the only goal of the
match after the Spaniards _ coached by former national coach Javier
Clemente _ were hammered 4-1 in the first leg two weeks ago in
Italy.
	   In Zurich, Switzerland, Francesco Totti made sure of AS Roma's
place in the quarterfinals, scoring with a free kick in second-half
injury to draw 2-2 against FC Zurich and advance 3-2 on aggregate.
Marco Delvecchio gave Roma a 1-0 lead in the 14th. Zurich's South
African striker Shaun Bartlett missed a second-half penalty but
then scored twice to give the Swiss side hope of an upset before
Totti scored.
	   In Brugge, Belgium, captain Alain Caveglia scored three goals as
France's Olympique Lyon defeated Belgian champion FC Brugge 4-3,
leading the French side to its first UEFA Cup quarterfinal in 30
years. Lyon advanced on a 5-3 aggregate. The winning goal came in
the 76th minute by Vikash Dhorasoo with the match tied 3-3. Tjorren
De Brul, Olivier De Cock and Anic Darco scored for Brugge.
	   In Bordeaux, France, Bordeaux played a scoreless draw with Swiss
side Grasshoppers, sending the French league leader through to the
last eight on away goals. The first leg in Zurich ended 3-3.
Bordeaux controlled most of the match but failed to break down a
Swiss team content to play on the break. Grasshoppers advanced to
the third round by default after Italy's Fiorentina, its
second-round opponent, was expelled after an Italian spectator
hurled an explosive device on to the pitch.
	   In Marseille, France, Titi Camara got a 70th-minute goal to give
Marseille a 1-0 win over Monaco and advance 3-2 in the first ever
UEFA Cup tie between two French teams. The winning goal came after
Jocelyn Gourvennec played a smart ball to Camara in the penalty
box. The Guyanan-born striker used his burly frame to swivel around
Bruno Irles and smash the ball past Fabien Barthez with a 10-meter
(yard) left foot shot. Monaco centerback Mohamed Konjic was sent
off in the 38th minute and Monaco never threatened after that.
	   In Liverpool, England, Spain's Celta added to Liverpool's
mounting woes as Haim Revivo scored in the 57th minute for a 1-0
victory, advancing the Spaniards 4-1 on aggregate. The Israeli
international scored as he broke down the left side and then cut in
front of the box and beat David James on a low shot from 10 meters
(yards). The loss was Liverpool's fifth in seven matches as the
famed English side _ twice winners of the UEFA Cup and four-time
European Champions Cup winners _ was out-passed and out-played by
the quick-moving Spanish team.
	   In Madrid, Spain, Atletico won 4-1 and advanced 5-3 over Real
Sociedad. Vladimir Jugovic scored twice as Atletico took a 2-0 lead
on his 17th-minute goal and a penalty in first-half injury time.
Real Sociedad made it 2-1 in the 50th on Xabier Gracia's goal. In
extra time, Santiago ``Santi'' Denia scored after only four minutes
with another a minute later from Jose Maria Romero.

Sharansky: Clinton visit important but don't raise `one-sided'
</HEADLINE>
hopes &QL; 
 &UR; By VIOREL URMA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Israeli Trade Minister Natan Sharansky said
President Bill Clinton's visit to the West Bank early next week was
an important event but it should not raise ``one-sided''
expectations among Palestinians.
	   ``The visit is an important contribution to solving the problems
but it's very important that it doesn't get one-sided _ that nobody
benefits from it more than others.
	   ``All the sides should do their best to use it for pushing ahead
the peace process,'' Sharansky said Tuesday in an interview with
The Associated Press.
	   With Clinton due to fly to the Middle East on Saturday, planning
stops in Israel, Gaza and the West Bank, differences over the Wye
River land-for-security accords have cast a pall over what was
supposed to be a celebration of growing peace between Israel and
the Palestinians.
	   The agreement that Clinton helped negotiate in October has since
been marred by bitter disputes and a suspension of the talks called
by Israel.
	   Tensions in the Palestinian areas have been running high in
recent days because of the dispute with Israel over releases of
Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails. The Palestinians hope
that Clinton will back up demands that as part of the Wye accord
Israel release more Palestinians held for anti-Israeli activities
and not just criminals.
	   Sharansky, a former dissident who spent years in Soviet jails
before being allowed to move to Israel, also expressed renewed
concerns about an alleged transfer of sensitive technology from
Russia to Iran.
	   The New York Times reported Tuesday that Iran has recruited
ex-Soviet germ warfare scientists for jobs in Tehran, with some of
them being asked to work on a clandestine biological weapons
program.
	   Officials with ties to Iran's top leadership have approached
more than a dozen Russian biological warfare experts with high
salary offers, the Times said, quoting Russian scientists and U.S.
officials.
	   Iran has rejected the claim. The Russian defense ministry would
not immediately comment on the report.
	   Sharansky said he discussed the issue with U.S. National
Security adviser Sandy Berger during talks in Washington earlier
Tuesday.
	   ``We shared with the Americans our concerns,'' he said. ``We
expect the Russian government to take all the powerful steps to
stop (nuclear technology transfer) to Iran. We can't consider the
question of East-West cooperation without taking this aspect into
consideration.''
	   While Sharansky said the Russian government doesn't appear to be
directly involved in such deals, he blamed unnamed Russian private
companies that he said were willing to sell sensitive technology
for much-needed cash.
	   ``This is one of the major topics in our discussions with the
Russians,'' he said.
	   Sharansky was visiting the United States for bilateral trade and
business talks with American officials.
	   Last summer, Israeli officials said they were concerned about a
$800 million nuclear power plant Russia is building in Iran, saying
it could help Iran advance its suspected nuclear weapons program.
	   Iran says the plant will be used only to generate power, and
that its facilities have been approved by the International Atomic
Energy Agency.

NATO outsiders impatiently await call up

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Central and eastern European nations
left out of NATO's plan to bring in new members next year are
increasingly frustrated that they're not getting any clear signs
they can soon join.
	   Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic are set to become NATO's
newest states at an April summit in Washington. Other former
communist nations are told the door remains open for them, but NATO
refuses to set a timeframe for further expansion.
	   Germany's Joschka Fischer expressed the view of many delegates
at Tuesday's meeting of NATO foreign minister when he said the
alliance needs time to ``digest'' the three new members.
	   ``This is not the wolf and the seven little goats,'' said
Fischer, evoking a folk tale of the hungry predator who devoured
too much, too fast.
	   Slovenia's foreign minister, Boris Frlec, however, said he and
others questioned the credibility of NATO's open-door policy.
	   ``You can say the door is open, but if nobody can go through,
the door is really closed,'' he said.
	   Slovenia and Romania came close to being selected in the first
group invited into NATO when the alliance made its choice of new
partners in 1996, but U.S. insistence on keeping the numbers down
left them on the sidelines.
	   Since then, candidates have intensified military and political
contacts through NATO's Partnership for Peace program. Their
soldiers join NATO maneuvers, their diplomats have offices at NATO
headquarters and their ministers come to NATO meetings.

Atletico Madrid beats Real Sociedad 4-1 to advance in UEFA Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Atletico Madrid scored twice in extra time
to post a 4-1 win Tuesday over Real Sociedad and advance to the
quarter finals of the UEFA Cup on a 5-3 aggregate.
	   At the end of regulation time the score was 2-1 _ the same
margin Real Sociedad won by two weeks ago in the Basque city of San
Sebastian.
	   The Madrid side wasted no time in putting Tuesday's game away.
	   Santiago Denia, or Santi, scored in the fourth minute of extra
time after recovering a header by teammate Jose Maria Romero right
in front of the goal.
	   A minute later Romero himself scored after racing down the left
side by himself and beating goalie Alberto Lopez.
	   Atletico Madrid had drawn first blood in the 17th minute with a
fabulous left-footed, overhead kick by Yugoslav midfielder Vladimir
Jugovic on a pass from Zoran Njegus.
	   In a play sure to make UEFA Cup highlight films, Jugovic tipped
the ball up to his chest, then quickly flipped it backwards and
sent it a meter over the head of stunned Real Sociedad goalkeeper
Alberto Lopez.
	   Jugovic converted a penalty one minute into first half injury
time after Mikel Antia was called for fouling Jordi Lardin. Jugovic
came up limping badly after his kick but kept playing in the second
half.
	   Real Sociedad made it 2-1 in the 50th minute as Xabier Gracia
evaded several defenders and put the ball just past Francisco Jose
Molina as the Atletico goalie came out to tackle him.
	   Rival fans fought outside Vicente Calderon Stadium hours before
the match. A 28-year-old Real Sociedad supporter was stabbed in the
chest as his girlfriend looked on.
	   The man was in intensive care after undergoing emergency heart
surgery, news reports said.

Olympic gymnast returns to court to keep father away permanently

<TEXT>
	   HOUSTON (AP) _ If Dominique Moceanu's adolescence seemed
unbearable, it apparently was idyllic compared to the gymnast's new
life as a grownup.
	   Since Oct. 28, when a judge granted the 17-year-old's request
for adult status, the 1996 gold medalist says she's endured verbal
threats and stalking by her father. Police are also investigating a
private investigator's claim that Dumitru Moceanu offered to pay
dlrs 10,000 to have a friend and her coach killed.
	   ``The threat of danger from my father hangs over my every day,''
the gymnast said in court papers filed a week ago to gain a
restraining order against her father. On Wednesday, the petite
teen-ager returns to court to have that restraining order made
permanent.
	   Messages left Tuesday with her father's lawyer, Katherine
Scardino, and at his workplace were not returned to The Associated
Press. Moceanu has, so far, declined the AP's request for an
interview about her court battles.
	   What began as a teen-age athlete's fight for control over her
millions in earnings has escalated into a vitriolic fight
threatening to shatter Moceanu's family for good.
	   ``It's just awful,'' Moceanu's publicist, Janey Miller, said
Tuesday. ``It is literally tearing them apart.''
	   The stormy relationship between father and daughter caught
public notice in late October, when she fled from her home with the
help of Marcy and Brian Huggins and her coach, Luminita Miscenco,
26. Huggins had befriended the Olympian while performing some work
at the dlrs 4 million Moceanu Gymnastics Inc. facility north of
Houston.
	   ``Things have been getting rough for a while, a lot of people
don't know,'' Moceanu said in her original lawsuit. ``We've been
trying to keep things hidden.''
	   Encouraged by fellow athletes, including gymnast Kurt Thomas, to
take more control of her finances, Moceanu dogged her father and
mother for answers about how her earnings, secured in a trust fund
that they alone have access to, were being spent.
	   ``I kill myself training and going to school, and what is he
doing with my money?'' Moceanu told the Houston Chronicle at the
time. ``They haven't been working since 1996. Where does their
income come from? Me.''
	   After months of stonewalling, the young athlete decided that her
only alternative was the courtroom. With her coach by her side, the
gymnast gathered her courage and phoned a lawyer from a shopping
mall pay phone. Within days, she filed suit against her parents,
asking a judge for adult status so she could legally begin asking
for an accounting of how her trust fund was spent.
	   ``It always had to be about the gym,'' she said then about her
relationship with her parents. ``I would think, `Don't you guys
know anything besides gymnastics? Can't we go out for ice cream?
Can't you be my mom and dad instead of me being your business?'''
	   She also revealed how her every move was monitored by her
father, that she had yet to go unchaperoned on a date. She also
revealed that her father has hit her ``a couple of times'' and that
she ``never had a childhood.''
	   Dumitru and Camelia Moceanu, both Romanian immigrants, fueled
her Olympic dream starting at age 3. They brought her to Houston so
she could be coached by Bela Karolyi.
	   At 14, Moceanu was the youngest American ever to win an Olympic
gold medal in gymnastics during the 1996 Summer Games in Atlanta.
	   With earnings generated by public appearances and competition,
her parents built a 70,000 square-foot gym just north of Houston a
few years ago.
	   Call the large gymnastics facility bearing the Moceanu name and
there's no doubt over whose image lures future business.
	   ``Hi! This is Dominique,'' begins the worn tape-recorded
greeting on the gym's answering machine. ``And you have reached
Moceanu Gymnastics.''

Netanyahu, under siege, achieves symbolic concessions on Clinton
</HEADLINE>
visit
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with details from Ross-Arafat meeting in graf 20 &QL;

 &UR; By RON KAMPEAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Agreeing to key symbolic concessions on U.S.
President Bill Clinton's visit to Israel and the Palestinian areas,
the Clinton administration extended a helping hand Tuesday to an
Israeli prime minister under political siege.
	   New clashes erupted in the West Bank as domestic pressure
mounted on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to abandon the Wye
River land-for-security agreement with the Palestinians.
	   The violence and Israel's political turmoil came just five days
before the start of Clinton's visit to Israel and the Palestinian
areas.
	   The trip had been intended to shore up the latest Mideast peace
agreement and restore calm to the region.
	   In one of several bouquets to Netanyahu, Clinton's top envoy to
the region reversed earlier claims and said that the president had
initiated the upcoming visit.
	   ``It was frankly an idea that came up from us, first,'' Dennis
Ross said after an hour-long meeting in Netanyahu's office.
	   Clinton's visit to Palestinian areas is seen by both sides as a
state visit to an entity Israel insists should not achieve
statehood.
	   Earlier U.S. claims that Netanyahu had suggested the visit at
October's Wye talks angered right-wingers in Netanyahu's Cabinet
and helped lead to a vote in parliament on Monday for a
no-confidence motion, to take place in two weeks.
	   The prime minister's perceived equivocations on the peace
process have led legislators from his coalition to say they might
not support him in the no-confidence motion, raising the
possibility of early elections.
	   Netanyahu has spent much of this week scrambling for support
from both his coalition and from opposition parties _ offering
apparently contradictory commitments.
	   Moshe Peled, a legislator in Netanyahu's coalition who opposes
further concessions to the Palestinians, told Channel 2 TV he now
``understood that the government is determined to stop the (peace)
process.''
	   By contrast, a legislator with the Arab Democratic Party said
that he was given assurances that the government would go ahead
with a planned troop withdrawal from the West Bank.
	   ``They will implement it, they will overcome the problems,''
Abdel Wahab Daroushe told Channel 2.
	   In another symbolic concession to Israel, Clinton also decided
to land at the newly opened Gaza airport in a helicopter instead of
in Air Force One, Palestinian and American officials both said.
	   The originally-planned Air Force One landing would have been
seen by both the Palestinians and the Israelis as emphasizing U.S.
support for Palestinian statehood.
	   Ross also appeared to side with Netanyahu's contention that a
recent surge in violence in the West Bank was backed by the
Palestinian Authority.
	   ``If you have differences, the place to deal with differences is
... at the table,'' Ross said. ``Not on the street, there is no
place for violence in this process.''
	   A cool reception for Clinton in Israel could have scuttled the
Wye agreement, and damaged Clinton politically.
	   ``When there's difficulties, the President comes and he does all
he can to put things back the way ought to be,'' Ross said.
	   Ross met later in the West Bank city of Ramallah with Arafat for
three and a half hours to discuss the Clinton visit and Palestinian
grievances over prisoner releases and Jewish settlement expansion,
according to senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat.
	   The Palestinian Authority has accused Netanyahu of sparking the
increased violence by reneging on an agreement to release
Palestinians jailed on terror charges.
	   Netanyahu, who released 250 prisoners last month _ most common
criminals _ says he never agreed to release killers.
	   He said that a promised transfer of five percent of the land
from Israeli control to joint jurisdiction next week would be
delayed if the Palestinians did not contain the violence.
	   ``If there will not be fulfillment of obligations, there will be
no withdrawal,'' he said after meeting Ross.
	   Four Palestinian students, an Israeli soldier and a settler
schoolgirl were injured in three separate incidents in the West
Bank on Tuesday.
	   In the Kalandiya refugee camp, hooded high school students
ripped piping off the rooftop of an abandoned building and tossed
it at passing jeeps. Israeli troops fired rubber bullets in
response.

Debate finished on controversial bill in lower house of parliament
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with debate finished. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Deputies in France's National Assembly on Tuesday
finally finished debating a controversial bill to give legal status
to unmarried couples.
	   The deputies were expected to formally adopt the measure on
Wednesday. Then it would go to the Senate _ probably in March.
	   The so-called Civil Solidarity Pact has been hotly contested by
the conservative opposition, which claimed it would lead to gay
marriages, and to adoptions by gay couples. The leftist coalition
of Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin has taken pains to
explain that it won't.
	   This is the bill's second attempt at passage in the lower house
of parliament. Rightist politicians finally stopped their delaying
tactics on Tuesday.
	   The bill, which has been laden with hundreds of ammendments,
would allow two unrelated people to form a union that would, among
other things, allow them to file joint tax returns, gain
inheritance benefits, and share social security coverage.

Bermuda victim may have tried to flee, expert says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HAMILTON, Bermuda (AP) _ Canadian teen-ager Rebecca Middleton
may have made a desperate attempt to flee before she was brutally
murdered, a forensics expert told a jury in Bermuda Tuesday.
	   Middleton's blood was found in two places a few meters from each
other, indicating she was injured in one area and fatally stabbed
in another, said Dr. Henry Lee, director of forensic science
laboratories for the Connecticut State Police.
	   ``She either tried to run away, walk away or crawl away _ it
could be to escape,'' Lee said. ``Then she received additional stab
wounds to the front and back, which caused excessive bleeding.''
	   Lee said there was no blood trail between the second site and
the road where passers-by discovered Middleton, indicating she was
carried to the road.
	   Lee, who previously testified for the defense in the O.J.
Simpson trial, took the stand Tuesday as a prosecution witness in
the murder trial against 19-year-old Justis Smith.
	   He said he reached his conclusions from photographs and
investigation reports of the July 3, 1996 murder. He didn't see the
body or visit the site of the crime.
	   Defense lawyer John Perry challenged Lee's testimony, saying Lee
was not in a position to give as good a description as someone who
had actually visited the site.
	   Middleton, 17, of Belleville, Ontario, was sexually assaulted
and stabbed to death at a picnic spot known as Ferry Reach.
	   Smith, a Bermudian, is charged with killing her after he and
Kirk Mundy offered her a motorcycle ride. The trial is in its third
week.

A changing of the guard for American golf
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Before anyone writes off Tiger Woods
or the rest of the 20-something stars who failed to win a major
championship this year, be sure to check the top qualifiers for the
U.S. team in the Presidents Cup.
	   And get used to seeing them represent the Stars and Stripes for
years to come.
	   David Duval, Tiger Woods, Jim Furyk, Justin Leonard and Phil
Mickelson were the first five in Presidents Cup points, which
amounts to money earned the past two seasons, with the dollar
doubled for 1998.
	   That all of them are in their 20s is no surprise to their
captain this week at Royal Melbourne Golf Club.
	   ``You're seeing the young players take over,'' Jack Nicklaus
said. ``For a few years it looked like youth would get pushed back,
but you knew pretty soon they were going to come through.''
	   The old man in the group is Furyk at a not-so-geriatric 28. He
is the least accomplished of the five _ only three victories on the
PGA Tour and never really in contention in a major until this year
(Masters, British Open). Then again, he also has 25 finishes in the
top 10 the past two seasons.
	   Mickelson, a month younger than Furyk, is playing on his fourth
straight national team and already has won 13 times on the PGA
Tour. Leonard is 26. A year after winning his first major in the
British Open, he didn't challenge in any of the majors, although he
did win against the toughest field of the year in The Players
Championship.
	   Duval, 27, was left off the Ryder Cup a year ago, which seems
remarkable now because he has won seven PGA Tour events since and
might be the best player in the world now, even if he won't make
that claim himself.
	   Woods will turn 23 at the end of the month and is irritated at
having to answer questions about a so-called slump. He couldn't get
a putt to fall all year and had to settle for two wins worldwide,
third place in the British Open (he missed the playoff by one
stroke) and top 10s in the Masters and PGA Championship.
	   The average age of American golf's ``Fab Five'' is a mere 26
1-2.
	   Throw in 34-year-old Davis Love III (No. 6 on the Presidents Cup
points list), and the average age for the top half of the U.S. team
is 27 1-2. The average age for the bottom half on the points list _
which featured three players in their 40s _ is 39 1-2.
	   Clearly, the American landscape regarding national teams is
changing.
	   ``I think it is,'' said Love, who is caught in between youth and
those fast approaching 40. ``It used to be Raymond Floyd, Lanny
Wadkins, Curtis Strange, Tom Kite and they're type. Now, Freddie
(Couples) is kind of the leader of the group. Here, we've got
Tiger, Duval, Furyk ... that's the group that is getting experience
for the future.''
	   Woods compared it to the European class that produced Ryder Cup
regulars such as Nick Faldo, Seve Ballesteros, Bernhard Langer and
Ian Woosnam.
	   ``That's what's happening here,'' Woods said. ``We all team up
well, we're all great friends. And we all happen to be playing well
at the same time.''
	   More evidence of a changing of the guard is the list of players
whose names are being tossed around as possible captains down the
road _ a sure sign their appearances in cup matches are dwindling.
	   Corey Pavin. Paul Azinger. Payne Stewart.
	   These are some of the players who briefly interrupted what has
become European dominance in the Ryder Cup. Stewart and Azinger
have yet to play in a Presidents Cup since it began in 1994.
	   All of them have the fire in the belly that makes them an
integral part of any national team. But attitude alone doesn't win
matches, another reason why the focus is shifting to Duval, Woods
and Co.
	   ``There is always going to be a changing of the guard,''
Nicklaus said. ``Sometimes, it comes in waves. But I think we're
going to see these guys for a long time.''
	   Leonard made his debut in the 1996 Presidents Cup and played his
first Ryder Cup last year. Ask him about the strength of the team
and he looks at Couples, Love and Mark O'Meara.
	   ``You're always going to have veterans on the team,'' Leonard
said. ``In five years, I hope to be known as one of those veterans.
But there is a core group of young guys, and it's fun to be part of
it.''

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The United States agreed to key symbolic
concessions Tuesday on U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit to
Israel and the Palestinian areas, extending a helping hand to an
Israeli prime minister under political siege.
	   New clashes erupted in the West Bank as domestic pressure
mounted on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to abandon the Wye
River land-for-security agreement with the Palestinians.
	   The violence and Israel's political turmoil came just five days
before the start of Clinton's visit to Israel and the Palestinian
areas.
	   The trip had been intended to shore up the latest Mideast peace
agreement.
	   In one of several bouquets to Netanyahu, Clinton's top envoy to
the region reversed earlier claims and said the president had
initiated the upcoming visit.
	   ``It was frankly an idea that came up from us,'' Dennis Ross
said after an hourlong meeting in Netanyahu's office.
	   Clinton's visit to Palestinian areas is seen by both sides as a
state visit to an entity Israel insists should not achieve
statehood.
	   Earlier U.S. claims that Netanyahu had suggested the visit at
October's Wye talks angered right-wingers in Netanyahu's Cabinet
and helped lead to a vote Monday in parliament for a no-confidence
motion, to take place in two weeks.
	   Netanyahu has spent much of this week scrambling for support
from both his coalition and from opposition parties _ offering
apparently contradictory commitments.
	   Moshe Peled, a legislator in Netanyahu's coalition who opposes
further concessions to the Palestinians, told Channel 2 TV he now
``understood that the government is determined to stop the (peace)
process.''
	   By contrast, a legislator with the Arab Democratic Party said he
was given assurances that Israel would go ahead with a planned
troop withdrawal from the West Bank.
	   ``They will implement it, they will overcome the problems,''
Abdel Wahab Daroushe told Channel 2.
	   In another symbolic concession to Israel, Clinton also decided
to land at the newly opened Gaza airport in a helicopter instead of
in Air Force One.
	   The originally-planned Air Force One landing would have been
seen by both the Palestinians and the Israelis as emphasizing U.S.
support for Palestinian statehood.
	   Ross also appeared to side with Netanyahu's contention that a
recent surge in violence in the West Bank was backed by the
Palestinian Authority.
	   ``If you have differences, the place to deal with differences is
... at the table,'' Ross said. ``Not on the street, there is no
place for violence in this process.''
	   Ross met later in the West Bank city of Ramallah with Arafat for
three and a half hours to discuss the Clinton visit and Palestinian
grievances over prisoner releases and Jewish settlement expansion,
according to senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat.

World travel not a problem for O'Meara
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Jack Nicklaus isn't giving too much
credence to the United States being at a disadvantage from playing
so far away from home in the Presidents Cup.
	   Five Americans were in the Million Dollar Challenge in South
Africa, while Fred Couples and John Huston tuned up in the
Australian Open. Lee Janzen was playing in Taiwan when he was
summoned as an alternate after the death of Hal Sutton's
father-in-law. Only Davis Love III, Scott Hoch, Phil Mickelson and
Mark Calcavecchia came straight from the States to the land Down
Under.
	   ``I don't really think that ... where you play makes a whole lot
of difference,'' Nicklaus said. ``All our fellows play all over the
world, and all the fellows internationally play all over the world,
and we're treated nicely wherever we go.''
	   The biggest globetrotter on the U.S. team is Mark O'Meara, who
has played a handful of worldwide events throughout his 18-year
career.
	   At the Skins Game, O'Meara was asked if his whirlwind schedule
might affect his play in the Presidents Cup.
	   ``If you look at my record internationally, and if you look at
the miles I travel and the way I play and compete, for some reason
I don't have a major difficulty with jet lag,'' O'Meara said. ``A
lot of times, I fly in and I usually finish in the top 10 or the
top five when I play internationally.''
	   After the Skins Game in California, O'Meara went to Sun City for
the Million Dollar Challenge and finished in a tie for fourth.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; FATHER TO BE: &LR;  Assuming everything goes according to schedule,
Phil Mickelson will be a first-time father just in time for
Father's Day.
	   Mickelson announced that he and wife Amy are expecting in June.
	   ``Obviously, we're both very excited,'' Mickelson said. ``We've
always always known that we wanted children and a family of our
own, and it's the right time.''
	   The couple has been married two years. In just five years on the
PGA Tour, Mickelson has won 12 times _ he also won once as an
amateur. Lacking only a major championship to cement his status as
one of the best in the world, maybe the U.S. Open wouldn't be a bad
place to get his first. After all, it traditionally ends on
Father's Day.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; SURGERY FOR LEHMAN: &LR;  Winning dlrs 420,000 in the Skins Game
didn't change Tom Lehman's mind about his injured right shoulder.
He had surgery to remove bone spurs the next day and will be out
until at least late January.
	   ``Hopefully, I'll be back for the end of the West Coast swing,''
Lehman said.
	   Lehman, the 1996 player of the year on the PGA Tour, suffered a
slight tear of his rotator cuff on an amusement park ride two days
before the British Open. He somehow made the cut, but wasn't the
same the rest of the year and even took two months off to give
himself a chance at making the Presidents Cup.
	   He made a good run in the Tour Championship, but faltered on the
weekend.
	   ``I can play good rounds, but I can't play good tournaments,''
Lehman said.
	   Just how quickly his shoulder recovers from surgery will be
critical. Missing most of the West Coast tournaments is one thing,
but at the end is the Match Play Championship with a dlrs 5 million
purse.
	   ___
	    &UR; HISTORIAN REMEMBERED: &LR;  Bill Inglish, the former golf writer for
The Daily Oklahoman who kept just about every record at the Masters
for nearly 35 years, died Dec. 2 of a heart attack at age 82.
	   Inglish, a member of the Golf Writers Association of America for
50 years, was regarded as the official recordkeeper of the Masters.
He started keeping the records in 1964 and didn't miss a tournament
until this year, when he was sidelined with prostate problems.
	   Golf Digest, in an effort to repay Inglish for all his
statistical work, took Inglish to the 1995 British Open as its
guest.
	   ___
	    &UR; DIVOTS: &LR;  Arnold Palmer will receive the 1999 Donald Ross Award
in March from the American Society of Golf Course Architects. The
award is given to an individual who has made significant
contributions to the game of golf and the profession of golf course
architecture. ... Se Ri Pak has signed on as a playing editor for
Golf Digest. ... The Golf Channel plans to televise more than 70
live tournaments in 1999, including early-round coverage of 10 PGA
Tour events. ... James Criagie has been appointed president and
chief executive officer of Spalding Sports Worldwide, replacing
Kevin Martin.

Cyclone Thelma skirts north coast, no major destruction on land
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DARWIN, Australia (AP) _ Cyclone Thelma churned its way across
the coast near the northern tip of Australia on Wednesday after
lashing the Tiwi Islands off the Northern Territory coast with
gale-force winds.
	   Police said intense gale-force winds, reaching speeds of up to
125 mph (200 kph), ripped through the region overnight but so far
emergency personnel had only received reports of minor structural
damage.
	   ``It was an intense night, there were a lot of trees ripped out,
building structural damage and a few power lines down,'' a police
spokesman said.
	   The Bureau of Meteorology said the slow moving category five
cyclone was now heading toward the Western Australian coast.

Trying to revive Russia's soccer, officials re-elect soccer chief
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: repeating to correct style of slug &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Murder, corruption and power struggles have dogged
Russian soccer lately, almost as badly as ridicule and lament
prompted by a string of embarrassing defeats for the Russian
national team.
	   The country's soccer officials resolved to change that Tuesday _
by electing as their leader the same person who has held the post
for nearly 20 years.
	   At a conference of the Russian Soccer Union in Moscow,
Vyacheslav Koloskov received the votes of more than half of the
nearly 100 leaders of local soccer clubs.
	   Koloskov has promised to revive Russian soccer, offering to
expand the powers of local clubs, giving them more control over
their own budgets.
	   Soccer in Russia, once flaunted by the Soviets as a realm of
pure athletic intentions and clean competition, has been making
headlines in newspaper's crime sections in the past few years.
	   Larisa Nechayeva, director general of the Spartak soccer club,
widely considered the country's most popular team, was fatally shot
last year at her home in an apparent contract hit.
	   Koloskov has recently hired bodyguards, saying he has received
threats pressuring him to step down before it's ``too late.''
	   The soccer union leaders feud bitterly and accuse each other of
corruption.
	   Meanwhile, the Russian team has not qualified for the World Cup
since 1990 or any major tournament since the 1992 European
Championship, and it suffered an embarrassing and demoralizing loss
to Iceland this fall in a qualifier for the 2000 European
Championship.
	   ``The situation that has developed in our soccer has the nature
of a real crisis,'' said Anatoly Byshovets, who coached the Soviet
soccer team to a gold medal in the 1988 Olympics, and who was
recently appointed head coach of the Russian Soccer Union.
	   The daily Vremya speculated Tuesday that the soccer chiefs
backed Koloskov's re-election because of his promises to devolve
power to local clubs.
	   ``The liberties that Koloskov intends to give to the regions
turn the seat of a functionary from a local federation into a very
lucrative place,'' Vremya wrote.
	   ``Keeping this kind of concrete profit in mind, it is easy to
part with abstract thoughts about the desirability of reshuffles in
the nation's top soccer leadership.''
	   Koloskov easily defeated his chief opponent, president of the
Dinamo Moscow club, Nikolai Tolstykh.
	   Some were skeptical about whether anything can raise Russia's
soccer from its sad state.
	   ``This is a power struggle going on. Nothing more nor less,''
said Vladimir Alyoshin, general director of Moscow's Luzhniki
sports stadium.

Clinton survival strategy keyed to contrition, GOP moderates

grafs to include Weld testimony. &QL; 
 &UR; With US-Clinton-Impeachment &QL; 
 &UR; By TERENCE HUNT &QC; 
 &UR; AP White House Correspondent &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Admit wrongdoing and deception. Be contrite.
Avoid confrontation. Raise the alarm to Americans that Congress is
about to ignore public sentiment with a momentous step toward
impeaching the president for sex and lies.
	   Above all, reach out to moderate Republicans who hold the key to
deciding the nation's historic impeachment drama.
	   Those were the main ingredients of President Bill Clinton's
survival strategy Tuesday as the House Judiciary Committee opened
the final stage of its inquiry into allegations of perjury,
obstruction of justice and abuse of power growing out of Clinton's
affair with Monica Lewinsky.
	   It is considered a foregone conclusion that the
Republican-dominated committee will approve at least one article of
impeachment in the next few days. That will set up a dramatic vote
in the full, 435-member House on whether Clinton will be only the
second president in history to be impeached and tried in the
Senate.
	   The House is expected to vote largely along party lines, and
Republicans hold a 22-member edge over Democrats, which requires a
switch of 11 votes to alter a party-line outcome. The White House
is targeting a group of about 30 moderate GOP lawmakers, hoping to
find enough members uneasy with impeachment to break ranks with
conservative leaders and kill the process.
	   With that group in mind, White House counsel Gregory Craig
acknowledged to the Judiciary Committee that Clinton's disputed
testimony last January was ``evasive, incomplete, misleading, even
maddening.'' But Clinton's lawyers also asserted, ``we are
duty-bound to draw a distinction between immoral conduct and
illegal or impeachable acts.''
	   The testimony was intended to answer criticism that Clinton was
not really taking responsibility for wrongdoing and that a smug
White House was acting like the impeachment battle was over.
	   Clinton had angered Republicans and Democrats alike with highly
legalistic answers to 81 questions from the Judiciary Committee;
the White House scrambled to undo that damage.
	   ``We had to come out and say that he didn't tell the truth, the
whole truth, and he was misleading,'' one White House official
said.
	   White House officials also let it be known that Clinton had
instructed his representatives not to be confrontational and
directed that their testimony be changed to make clear he is deeply
sorry and accepts responsibility.
	   The administration is waiting to see how the contrition strategy
works. If that's not enough, officials hold out the possibility
that Clinton himself will address the subject again. Former
Massachusetts Gov. William Weld, a prominent Republican moderate,
was recruited to testify against impeachment Wednesday.
	   Weld's presentation is aimed at fellow GOP moderates, most of
whom reside in the Northeast, letting them hear the
anti-impeachment case from someone who is ideologically, regionally
and substantively aligned with them.
	   Even with the White House's new soft-spoken manner, there was a
taste of the combative approach that marked much of the last 11
months.
	   Princeton historian Sean Wilentz, testifying for the White
House, riled some Republican members by asserting that an
impeachment vote would put lawmakers at risk of ``going down in
history with the zealots and the fanatics.''
	   To those who are unsure about the charges but vote to impeach
anyway, he said, ``History will track you down and condemn you for
your cravenness.''
	   The White House and its allies are banking on the belief that
Americans, preoccupied by their own lives and the holidays, are
going to be stunned that Republicans are still waging an
impeachment fight.
	   Wasn't that battle decided by Republican losses in the November
elections? Besides, the polls show that only about 30 percent of
Americans favor impeachment. Democrats warned that a Senate trial
would prolong the case by six months to a year more.
	   ``There isn't a great groundswell out there to have this hearing
and go forward with an impeachment,'' said American University
political scientist James Thurber. ``It is somewhat of an inside
game here.''
	   The White House hopes the House will end the issue with a
censure vote against Clinton, or a censure vote accompanied by a
fine. The administration's line is: make an offer, we'll take a
look at it.
	   Even a financial punishment looks more attractive now amid
speculation that Clinton is losing ground and a House vote to
impeach is more likely.
	   When the House voted in September to open its inquiry, ``They
set in motion a runaway train and they've had no brakes to bring it
to a halt,'' said American Enterprise Institute scholar Norm
Ornstein.
	   ``I think it can be stopped but it's probably not going to be by
an act by the president,'' Ornstein said. ``It's going to be a
group of centrist Republicans going to Bob Livingston (the incoming
speaker) and saying, `You've got to intervene here.' The odds of
that are not huge now.''

Australian legislator angry at delays in explanation of cousins'
</HEADLINE>
deaths
 &UR; By ALAN THORNHILL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Legislator Bob Sercombe is planning
to press for an explanation of the deaths of an Australian tourist
and his cousin in Greece last June.
	   Sercombe says he expects to raise the case in the nation's
Parliament before it adjourns for the holidays on Thursday.
	   Cousins George Karalis, 32, and George Loizos, 28, were both
found dead on their fishing dinghy near the Greek island of Evia on
June 3.
	   Within hours, local police had declared the crime to be a
murder-suicide.
	   But family members, who belong to the large Greek community in
Melbourne, do not accept that.
	   They suspect that the pair, close friends since childhood, ran
foul of drug smugglers who operate in the area.
	   Sercombe told The Associated Press that Greek authorities have
still not supplied details of the case that Melbourne Coroner
Graham Johnstone requested on June 16.
	   He said he would press Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs
and Trade, which has been seeking this information through
diplomatic channels, to push harder for this information.
	   Departmental spokesman Tony Melville said Australian authorities
have been told that the investigation that the Greek police have
been conducting has now reached what he called ``a delicate
stage.''
	   Sercombe is a member of Australia's opposition Labor party.
	   Loizos was born in Melbourne, but returned to Greece with his
family in 1978.
	   Karalis was visiting relatives in Greece at the time of his
death.

Queen Beatrix, George Mitchell. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Paul McCartney will take to the Internet next week
for a live chat session with fans.
	   The former Beatle wants to talk about his wife, Linda, who died
from breast cancer in April, but no topic is banned, McCartney
spokesman Geoff Baker said.
	   McCartney, not exactly an Internet buff, is ``very excited, but
a bit nervous,'' Baker said. He chose the format over several
television offers because he wants to go ``direct to the fans''
without the filter of an interviewer.
	   The hour-long chat session on Dec. 17 will include the premier
screening of music videos of some of Linda's songs and new
photographs.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prince Charles had lots of questions for the two
pregnant Spice Girls.
	   ``Have you been doing lots of exercise,'' he asked Posh Spice
Victoria Adams on Monday at the 77th Royal Variety Performance. Her
baby is due in February.
	   Scary Spice Mel B responded: ``Yeah, this'' as she mimed eating.
Her baby is also due next year. The prince wanted to know due dates
and how each singer was coping.
	   The four-member Spice Girls performed ``Goodbye'' sitting down
so the pregnant Spices wouldn't have to dance. The show raised
money for the Entertainment Artistes' Benevolent Fund.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LONDON (AP) _ Mick Jagger and Jerry Hall are checking out
expensive boarding high schools for their youngest _ and he's only
14 months old.
	   The two visited Stowe, a private school outside London, last
month, before their latest marital blowout, the Daily Telegraph
reported Tuesday.
	   Gabriel Luke Beauregard Jagger isn't the only celebrity seedling
that may wind up at Stowe. Last week, Michael Jackson denied
reports in the Sunday Telegraph that he planned to send his
21-month-old son Prince.
	   Jagger's 12-year-old son James is registered to attend Eton when
he reaches high school. That's where Princes William and Harry go
to school.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   UTRECHT, Netherlands (AP) _ The first Dutch euro coin tumbled
out of the minting machine Tuesday and went straight into the
pocket of Queen Beatrix.
	   The new European currency, known as the euro, comes into
circulation in the 11 participating nations between Jan. 1 and June
30, 2002.
	   The euro coins share a common European design on one side, but
carry individual national designs on the flip side. The Netherlands
has chosen a portrait of Beatrix.
	   The freshly minted coin _ presented to the queen in a ceremony
at the Netherlands Mint _ was the first of more than 3 billion euro
coins that will be produced to replace the current Dutch guilder
coins.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ George Mitchell, the chair of the Northern
Ireland peace talks, will join the faculty of Queens College,
school officials said Tuesday.
	   The former Senate majority leader will join the City University
of New York campus in the spring as senior fellow at the Michael
Harrington Center for Democratic Values and Social Change, and
visiting professor in international studies.
	   Mitchell's main project will be organizing a conference on the
Irish peace process. The conference, to be held in the spring, will
be attended by officials who participated in the peace talks that
led to an agreement in April.

Canadian high court asked to let boy sue mother for pre-birth
</HEADLINE>
injuries &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   OTTAWA (AP) _ Lawyers for a 5-year-old boy asked Canada's
Supreme Court to allow the child to sue his mother for injuries
sustained in a car accident when he was in her womb.
	   The lawyers, hired by the boy's grandfather, contended Tuesday
that the mother, Cynthia Dobson, should be held liable because her
alleged negligence as a driver caused Ryan Dobson's injuries.
	   Mrs. Dobson was in her 27th week of pregnancy when her car
skidded into a truck in New Brunswick in March 1993.
	   Ryan was born by caesarean section hours later and suffers from
permanent disabilities that include cerebral palsy. He lives with
his mother.
	   There is no precedent in Canada for a mother to be held liable
for injuries suffered by a fetus because of her negligence.
Canadian law does not recognize an unborn fetus as a person with
legal rights, and abortion is legal nationwide.
	   The high court judges' questions during Tuesday's hearing
suggested that at least some felt the issue of fetal rights was a
matter for Parliament, rather than the courts, to resolve.
	   But the court reserved its decision and isn't expected to rule
for several months.
	   Last year, the Supreme Court ruled that a woman addicted to
glue-sniffing should not be detained against her will even if the
action was aimed at halting her substance abuse to protect her
fetus.
	   In the current case, lawyers for Mrs. Dobson's insurance company
want the high court to overturn a 1997 New Brunswick court ruling
that said Ryan had legal standing to take a lawsuit to trial.
	   One of those lawyers, Robert Barnes, argued in a legal brief
that the New Brunswick ruling opened a ``Pandora's box'' of
potential claims against pregnant women.
	   ``A woman has the legal right during pregnancy to control her
body, including the right to engage in behavior which may carry
risk to herself,'' Barnes argued.
	   That position is backed by one of Canada's biggest
abortion-rights groups, the Canadian Abortion Rights Action League,
which has intervened in the case.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ President Bill Clinton gained precious ground
Tuesday in his struggle to avoid impeachment, winning support from
one moderate Republican while a platoon of White House defenders
argued his case before the House Judiciary Committee. ``As surely
as we know that what he did was sinful, we also know it is not
impeachable,'' White House lawyer Gregory Craig told a committee
bristling with skeptical Republicans. Other witnesses _ including
some who sat in judgment of President Richard Nixon a
quarter-century ago _ argued that Clinton's conduct in the Monica
Lewinsky affair was no Watergate, and thus not worthy of
impeachment. (US-CLINTON-IMPEACHMENT).
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Former President Suharto on Wednesday
was at the center of a corruption inquiry that goes to the heart of
attempts to reform Indonesia as it grapples with political, ethnic
and religious turmoil. State lawyers planned to question him and
officials warned he could be placed under house arrest if he does
not cooperate. Still, many doubted the resolve of the government,
dominated by former Suharto supporters, to move against the old
leader. On Tuesday, at least 2,000 chanting students staged a
string of protests around Indonesia's capital city to press their
demand that Suharto be put on trial. Suharto scoffs at accusations
that he stashed billions of dollars overseas and claims he has
``not one cent'' squirreled away in foreign bank accounts.
(INDONESIA-SUHARTO)
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The United States has agreed to key symbolic
concessions on President Bill Clinton's visit to Israel and the
Palestinian areas, extending a helping hand to an Israeli prime
minister under political siege. New clashes erupted Tuesday in the
West Bank as domestic pressure mounted on Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu to abandon the Wye River land-for-security agreement with
the Palestinians. The violence and Israel's political turmoil came
just five days before the start of Clinton's visit to Israel and
the Palestinian areas. In one of several bouquets to Netanyahu,
Clinton's top envoy to the region, Dennis Ross, reversed earlier
claims and said the president had initiated the upcoming visit.
Earlier U.S. claims that Netanyahu had suggested the visit at
October's Wye talks angered right-wingers in Netanyahu's Cabinet
and helped lead to a vote Monday in parliament for a no-confidence
motion, to take place in two weeks. (ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS)
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbs and ethnic Albanians have
joined in rejecting the latest U.S. plan for Kosovo, despite a NATO
appeal for a spirit of compromise to find peace in the embattled
province. Ratko Markovic, head of the Serbian government's
negotiating team, said Tuesday that the U.S. draft would require
``reconstructing the whole of Yugoslavia'' and would pave the way
for independence for the majority Albanian province. The chief
spokesman for the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army also rejected the
plan drafted by American envoy Christopher Hill. Adem Demaci
suggested Hill was biased and should be replaced. ``Mr. Hill either
doesn't understand the Albanian problems, or he is leaning toward
the Serbs,'' Demaci said. ``The State Department should ... send us
more qualified people.'' (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Francis Albert Sinatra _ special agent for the
FBI? It would have happened if Ol' Blue Eyes had his way, according
to a cache of confidential documents from Sinatra's FBI file, made
public Tuesday. Sinatra in 1950 volunteered to work undercover for
the feds _ an offer they could (and did) refuse. That same year,
according to a confidential federal informant, Sinatra smuggled
dlrs 1 million cash into Italy for mobster Charles ``Lucky''
Luciano. Such tales are the stuff of The Sinatra Files, a mishmash
of facts, allegations and just plain rumors. The papers _ 1,275
pages in all _ offered few nuggets of new information. There were
vague allegations of mob ties and communist sympathies, but little
detail or evidence of either. (US-SINATRA FILES)

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Technology shares faltered Tuesday after lifting
the Nasdaq market toward another record high, while financial
shares led the broad market lower amid nagging worries about the
global economy. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 42.49
points _ or by 0.5 percent _ at 9,027.98, bouncing back from a
124-point deficit over the final hour of trading. The Dow, which
had gained 190 points the prior two sessions, now sits about 350
points below the record of 9,374.27 set Nov. 23. (US-CLOSING
STOCKS)
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ AT and T Corp. is buying IBM's data networking
business for dlrs 5 billion cash, filling an important gap in AT
and T's ability to supply business customers with high speed data
services and Internet access. International Business Machines
Corp.'s Global Network Business, with dlrs 2.5 billion in revenue,
has one million Internet users as well as tens of thousand of
business customers in the U.S. and abroad. Companies use the
network to link computers that are far apart, to accept orders from
customers and to connect to the Internet. Under the deal announced
Tuesday, 5,000 IBM employees from the global network division will
go to work for AT and T when the deal closes. The deal is expected
to be concluded by next summer. (US-AT and T-IBM)
	   ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ The top official of a
Gulf Arab group on Tuesday cautioned oil rich nations against
over-production, saying it is the root cause of falling world
prices. The plea was made by Jamil al-Hojeilan, the
secretary-general of the Gulf Cooperation Council, in a television
interview on the second day of an annual summit of GCC leaders.
This year, the meeting focused on the calamitous effects of low oil
prices on the GCC economies. Analysts say Venezuela, Iran,
Indonesia and Qatar are the main over-producers. ``The strategic
view of oil policy in the GCC countries is to keep a balance
between supply and demand. We hope that pledges of abiding by
quotas agreed upon are respected,'' al-Hojeilan said. (GULF-SUMMIT)
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ European Central Bank President Wim
Duisenberg said Tuesday he saw no risk of deflation for the
European economy despite the expected slowdown of growth next year.
Duisenberg gave a generally sober assessment of the economic
situation in the 11 nations that adopt the euro as their common
currency on Jan. 1. ``The risks are on the downside. Every single
figure that becomes available confirms that more and more,''
Duisenberg told a European Parliament committee. He said inflation
was under control in the euro-zone. Although the bank projected a
rise from 1.2 percent to 1.6 percent next year, he saw no danger of
price increases exceeding the ECB's upper limit of 2 percent.
(EU-CENTRAL BANK)
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Germany's persistently high
joblessness remained below 4 million in November for the third
straight month, though the unemployment rate rose slightly, to 10.2
percent, the Labor Office in Nuremberg reported Tuesday.
Nationwide, 3.95 million people were jobless, 54,300 more than in
October, when Germany reached its lowest unemployment rate _ 10.1
percent _ in two years. The seasonally adjusted rise of 4,000 jobs
was far above analysts' expectations. But Labor Office chief
Bernhard Jagoda said the numbers did not signal a turn for the
worse in the German labor market. ``If December doesn't present any
surprises we'll see the 1998 average jobless slightly below 4.3
million at the end of the year,'' Jagoda said.
(GERMANY-UNEMPLOYMENT)
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Two mid-sized European pharmaceutical companies,
Zeneca Group and Astra, are negotiating a merger that would
transform them into one of the world's top ten drug makers. A
Zeneca spokesman said Tuesday that executives are in ``advanced
discussions'' of a deal described as a merger of equals. An Astra
spokesman also confirmed the talks, though refused to elaborate.
Zeneca, based in London and Astra, based in Sweden, have a combined
stock value of dlrs 63 billion. Astra is best known as the maker of
Prilosec, an ulcer and heart burn medication that is the world's
best selling prescription drug. Zeneca is the second leading maker
of cancer drugs behind Bristol-Myers Squibb of the United States.
It also has a large agrochemical business. Both companies sell
asthma and anesthesia drugs. (US-ZENECA-ASTRA)

Indonesia's Suharto at center of corruption probe
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos JAK101-105 &QL; 
 &UR; By GEOFF SPENCER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ He was one of the most powerful men in
Asia until protesting students hounded him from office a little
over six months ago.
	   Now former President Suharto is at the center of a corruption
inquiry that goes to the heart of attempts to reform Indonesia as
it grapples with political turmoil, and ethnic and religious strife
fueled by the worst economic crisis in decades.
	   Its hands forced by a new wave of student protests, the
government has ordered a fresh investigation into Suharto's wealth.
	   State lawyers planned to question him Wednesday, and officials
warned he could be placed under house arrest if he does not
cooperate.
	   Still, many doubt the resolve of the government, dominated by
former Suharto supporters, to move against the old leader.
	   In recent weeks, students have stepped up protests after an
earlier government inquiry found no evidence against the
77-year-old Suharto.
	   Critics said that probe by Attorney General Andi Mohammad Ghalib
was a whitewash. Now under pressure, Suharto's successor and
one-time protege, President B.J. Habibie, has ordered Ghalib to try
again.
	   It's doubtful the new inquiry will placate the students who have
accused Ghalib, a three-star army general, of going soft on
Suharto, himself a retired general.
	   Virtually every day hundreds, sometimes thousands, have
attempted to march on Suharto's heavily guarded home.
	   Always blocked by troops, some demand he be hanged. Most say he
should be sent to court and tried immediately, not just for graft
but for human rights abuses.
	   On Tuesday, hundreds protested outside Ghalib's office calling
for justice. Thousands more staged rallies and protests against
Suharto elsewhere in the capital.
	   And security has been tightened around Jakarta this week amid
fears of more protests during Suharto's questioning.
	   Nine students were shot and killed by security forces when they
tried to march on Parliament in November. Much of Jakarta was
wrecked or burned when riots broke out in May and claimed 1,200
lives, prompting Suharto to quit.
	   Suharto scoffs at accusations that he stashed billions of
dollars overseas and claims he has ``not one cent'' squirreled away
in foreign bank accounts.
	   He says he is worth about dlrs 3 million, far less than an
estimate earlier this year by Forbes magazine that put his wealth
at dlrs 4 billion. Others say it is even higher.
	   For weeks investigators have been compiling lists of assets
belonging to the Suharto clan, including hundreds of thousands of
acres of holdings across this sprawling Southeast Asian nation of
about 17,000 islands.
	   Suharto's six children are among Indonesia's wealthiest people
and head huge business empires that flourished under his patronage.
	   In the months since their father's downfall they have been the
target of separate corruption probes. Two of Suharto's sons have
been banned from leaving the country as investigators unravel their
business dealings.
	   Meanwhile companies controlled by their siblings have been
stripped of many lucrative government contracts and monopolies.
	   Habibie has promised to root out corruption and nepotism, which
international agencies like the World Bank say have worsened
Indonesia's economic woes.
	   But many critics say the government's links to the old leader
will prevent it from prosecuting him.
	   Even those in the ex-president's camp doubt the determination of
Habibie, a friend of Suharto for four decades and his Cabinet
minister for 20 years.
	   ``If Suharto does go to court, it could drag down the
government, bringing senior incumbent and former officials _ as
well as all the cronies suspected of accruing ill-gotten wealth _
into messy litigation,'' Suharto's legal advisor, Yohanes Yacob,
said last week.
	   The corruption allegations hang over Suharto at a dramatic time
for Indonesia, which was hit hard by Asia's financial meltdown.
	   A deep recession has entered its second year. Millions of people
have lost their jobs and have slipped into poverty. The annual
inflation rate is running at 80 percent. Crime is climbing.
	   Looting and riots break out sporadically, and relations between
the Muslim majority and the Christian minority, kept in check by
Suharto's iron-fisted policies, have deteriorated.

	   SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) _ With the bulk of their construction
work behind them, Endeavour's astronauts gave the new
up-and-running space station a safe but shaky lift to a higher
orbit on Tuesday.
	   The pilots fired the shuttle thrusters to climb to an altitude
of about 248 miles, 5{ miles higher than before. They'll soar even
higher on Friday.
	   NASA wants to leave the international space station in as high
an orbit as possible. Spacecraft gradually sink because of the
naturally occurring drag of the atmosphere, and need to be boosted
periodically.
	   The seven-story, 35-ton station swung back and forth a half-foot
or more in Endeavour's cargo bay, its solar wings flapping, as the
shuttle moved higher and higher.
	   ``Wow, look at that,'' astronaut Nancy Currie called to her
crewmates. The tips of the wings waved a full foot, she said.
	   The astronauts kept close watch on the quivering stack during
the 20-minute ride, carefully spacing out their thruster pulses to
reduce the stress.
	   ``Nice job,'' Mission Control said when it was over. Shuttle
commander Robert Cabana replied that the boosting procedure
``really worked slick.''
	   After the previous night's 7{-hour spacewalk to wire the Zarya
and Unity station modules together, the astronauts took it easy
Tuesday. It was their first break since rocketing into orbit last
Friday.
	   ``We've still got a lot ahead of us,'' Cabana told a TV
interviewer, ``but it really feels good to have everything we need
for mission success under our belt. It's really been an outstanding
flight.''
	   As the astronauts relaxed, flight controllers took up the slack,
monitoring all systems aboard the space station. Unity, the
American-made side, came to life for the first time in orbit late
Monday after spacewalkers hooked up 40 electrical connections.
	   The Unity connecting chamber was right around the freezing point
when its heaters kicked on. The 36-foot cylinder should be warm
enough by the time the six shuttle astronauts venture inside on
Thursday, said NASA's lead flight director, Bob Castle. The
astronauts will spruce up Unity and Zarya, and drop off clothes for
the first permanent crew, due to arrive in early 2000.
	   Unity's fans and computers also were purring.
	   ``We put the skeleton together of the beginnings of the space
station'' on Sunday, Castle said after power and data began flowing
between Unity and Zarya. ``Today we hooked up the first parts of
the nervous system.''
	   Unlike the Russian-built Zarya control module, which gets its
energy from the sun, Unity lacks solar wings and so must rely on
Zarya for power. Unity also lacks a communication system, but not
for long.
	   Spacewalkers Jerry Ross and James Newman will go out again
Wednesday to attach two 100-pound antennas to Unity. That way, NASA
won't have to rely on Russia's Mission Control to communicate with
the segment.
	   A third and final spacewalk is set for Saturday.

Presidents Cup not yet a pressure cooker
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ The ``War on the Shore'' it isn't.
	   The way the players and captains are talking about the
Presidents Cup, it might as well be called ``Peace at Port Phillip
Bay.''
	   U.S. captain Jack Nicklaus set the tone for this year's matches
six weeks ago during the Tour Championship, when he talked more
about goodwill for the game than a winner-take-all mentality that
leaves grown men crying about a missed 6-foot putt.
	   ``Both teams want to win,'' Nicklaus said. ``But the important
part of this thing to me is that the game of golf wins.''
	   The same warm, fuzzy sentiments spilled from the mouth of Peter
Thomson, the five-time British Open champion and captain of the
International team.
	   ``It's not a war. This is a game, this is sport,'' Thomson said,
as players took to Royal Melbourne Golf Club Wednesday for the
second day of practice.
	   ``There will be no blood on this floor, I'm sure. Like Jack, I
want to see this succeed, and I want it to be a close contest and I
want everybody to be satisfied _ those who competed and those who
watched.''
	   It helps that all but two players on the International team _
Japan's Joe Ozaki and Shigeki Maruyama _ will play on the PGA Tour
next year.
	   It also helps that the United States has won the Presidents Cup
both times since it began in 1994 to give foreign-born players from
outside Europe a chance to compete under one flag, similar to the
Ryder Cup.
	   Both teams kept their distance on the first full day of practice
Tuesday _ the International team in their khaki slacks and
cream-yellow shirts, the United States decked out in red shirts and
red caps, with matching uniforms for the caddies.
	   ``It was just a chance to kind of see the course and relax and
hit a few shots,'' said Justin Leonard.
	   That wasn't necessarily the case at any of the previous Ryder
Cup matches that have taken on a life of their own ever since
Europe became the dominant team by winning five of the past seven
events.
	   Both teams will meet for a barbecue on Saturday night. In some
of the previous Ryder Cup matches, the teams felt like they were
the ones being cooked.
	   ``You start getting nervous a little bit later than you do for a
Ryder Cup,'' Davis Love III said.
	   He said the casual atmosphere would change by Saturday. ``It's
not quite the pressure of the Ryder Cup. But still, we don't want
to lose.''
	   If there is one player who has an edge to him about what these
matches are all about, it is Tiger Woods, at 22 the youngest player
in the Presidents Cup. The only man to win the U.S. Amateur three
years in a row, expectations were heaped on his shoulders last year
in his first Ryder Cup, and he took much of the blame in another
U.S. loss.
	   ``I believe that this Presidents Cup is played more in a spirit
of the way it should be played,'' said Woods, making his first
appearance. ``It is not a battle. It is a friendly match between
two different sides and we all know each other.''
	   The ``War on the Shore'' was the 1991 Ryder Cup at Kiawah
Island, South Carolina.
	   Europe, which had lost every Ryder Cup since 1959 and all but
one since 1935, finally turned the tide by winning back the cup in
1985, winning on American soil for the first time in 1987 and then
making it three in a row at The Belfry in 1989.
	   The Americans _ players, reporters and fans _ brought a bunker
mentality to the sand dunes of Kiawah, and it hasn't left.

Incidence of rape, including of children rises dramatically, report
</HEADLINE>
says &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PORT MORESBY, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ The incidence of rape in
Papua New Guinea has risen dramatically and children as young as 10
years were involved in gang rape, according to a new report.
	   ``Rape has increased in PNG and has become extremely violent and
random,'' said the Papua New Guinea Law and Justice Baseline Survey
of Community Initiatives.
	   The report was released by Australian aid agency AusAID on
Wednesday.
	   Pack rape was particularly violent and sometimes fatal.
	   ``An emerging trend in pack rape is the diverse ages of
offenders. Children as young as 10 are now involved,'' the report
said.
	   The report said accurate statistics were unavailable because
many cases go unreported.
	   ``However the number of rapes reported has increased
dramatically from 285 in 1980 to 1,896 in 1990,'' the report said.
	   The perceived inferior status of women promoted sexual violence,
and many women and girls had developed a fatalistic outlook and
believed that forced sexual intercourse must be accepted as part of
womanhood, it said.
	   Rape, especially pack rape, was a way of asserting male
superiority and solidarity, the report said.
	   Young, unemployed men involved in rape tried to justify their
actions by claiming lack of access to desirable women; an urge to
teach educated, liberated young women or girls a lesson; the
acceptability of a man sharing his girlfriend with other friends; a
payback for turning down a request for sexual intercourse; or the
influence of alcohol or drugs.
	   The report said the incidence of rape was especially high in the
remote highlands, where it had become a common element in tribal
fighting.
	   The report said violence against women -- including rape and
assault -- was a consequence of a breakdown of traditional
constraints on men and the influence of the urban lifestyle.

Italy, France advance three to quarterfinals; Spain gets two
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Recaps pvs; adds stabbing in Madrid &QL;

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Italy and France will have three clubs each in the
UEFA Cup quarterfinals, accompanied by Spanish sides Celta and
Atletico Madrid.
	   Atletico's 4-1 win Tuesday in extra time over Real Sociedad,
eliminating the Basques 5-3 on aggregate, was overshadowed by the
stabbing of a 28-year-old Sociedad fan outside Atletico's Vicente
Calderon stadium in a clash between rival fans hours before the
match.
	   The man was reported in intensive care after undergoing
emergency heart surgery.
	   For Italy _ with Parma, Bologna and Roma advancing from the
third round, second leg _ it's the same old story. Italian teams
have won the cup seven of the last 10 seasons with Inter Milan the
holders.
	   Italian success is synonymous with the UEFA Cup. In addition to
seven of the last 10 titles, Italian club have featured in nine of
those 10 finals.
	   France advanced Lyon, Bordeaux and Marseille.
	   Joining Atletico from Spain was Celta, which won 1-0 and ousted
Liverpool 4-1 on aggregate.
	   The matches:
	   In Parma, Italy, Parma reached the quarterfinals with a 3-1
victory, going through on a 4-2 aggregate over Scotland's Glasgow
Rangers. The Italians _ 1995 UEFA Cup champions _ preserved a
four-year unbeaten home streak in European games on second-half
goals by Abel Balbo, Stefano Fiore and Enrico Chiesa. Rangers took
a 1-0 lead on a goal in the 28th by German midfielder Jorg Albertz.
Parma's second-half rally was helped when Rangers' Italian defender
Sergio Porrini was expelled in the 45th.
	   In Seville, Spain, Bologna moved into the quarterfinals on a 4-2
aggregate despite losing to Spain's Betis 1-0. Oliverio Alvarez
scored for Betis in the fourth minute for the only goal of the
match after the Spaniards _ coached by former national coach Javier
Clemente _ were hammered 4-1 in the first leg two weeks ago in
Italy.
	   In Zurich, Switzerland, Francesco Totti made sure of AS Roma's
place in the quarterfinals, scoring with a free kick in second-half
injury to draw 2-2 against FC Zurich and advance 3-2 on aggregate.
Marco Delvecchio gave Roma a 1-0 lead in the 14th. Zurich's South
African striker Shaun Bartlett missed a second-half penalty but
then scored twice to give the Swiss side hope of an upset before
Totti scored.
	   In Brugge, Belgium, captain Alain Caveglia scored three goals as
France's Olympique Lyon defeated Belgian champion FC Brugge 4-3,
leading the French side to its first UEFA Cup quarterfinal in 30
years. Lyon advanced on a 5-3 aggregate. The winning goal came in
the 76th minute by Vikash Dhorasoo with the match tied 3-3. Tjorren
De Brul, Olivier De Cock and Anic Darco scored for Brugge.
	   In Bordeaux, France, Bordeaux played a scoreless draw with Swiss
side Grasshoppers, sending the French league leader through to the
last eight on away goals. The first leg in Zurich ended 3-3.
Bordeaux controlled most of the match but failed to break down a
Swiss team content to play on the break. Grasshoppers advanced to
the third round by default after Italy's Fiorentina, its
second-round opponent, was expelled after an Italian spectator
hurled an explosive device on to the pitch.
	   In Marseille, France, Titi Camara got a 70th-minute goal to give
Marseille a 1-0 win over Monaco and advance 3-2 in the first ever
UEFA Cup tie between two French teams. The winning goal came after
Jocelyn Gourvennec played a smart ball to Camara in the penalty
box. The Guyanan-born striker used his burly frame to swivel around
Bruno Irles and smash the ball past Fabien Barthez with a 10-meter
(yard) left foot shot. Monaco centerback Mohamed Konjic was sent
off in the 38th minute and Monaco never threatened after that.
	   In Liverpool, England, Spain's Celta added to Liverpool's
mounting woes as Haim Revivo scored in the 57th minute for a 1-0
victory, advancing the Spaniards 4-1 on aggregate. The Israeli
international scored as he broke down the left side and then cut in
front of the box and beat David James on a low shot from 10 meters
(yards). The loss was Liverpool's fifth in seven matches as the
famed English side _ twice winners of the UEFA Cup and four-time
European Champions Cup winners _ was out-passed and out-played by
the quick-moving Spanish team.
	   In Madrid, Spain, Atletico won 4-1 and advanced 5-3 over Real
Sociedad. Vladimir Jugovic scored twice as Atletico took a 2-0 lead
on his 17th-minute goal and a penalty in first-half injury time.
Real Sociedad made it 2-1 in the 50th on Xabier Gracia's goal. In
extra time, Santiago ``Santi'' Denia scored after only four minutes
with another a minute later from Jose Maria Romero.

Japanese stocks fall in early trading, dollar lower against yen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stocks edged lower in early trading
Wednesday after a moderate drop on Wall Street overnight. The U.S.
dollar slipped against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 61.78 points,
or 0.42 percent, to 14,746.42 in the first 30 minutes of morning
trading. On Tuesday, the Nikkei gained 84.71 points, or 0.58
percent.
	   The dollar bought 119.10 yen, down 0.76 yen from late Tuesday in
Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 119.31 yen
overnight.
	   Japanese stocks slipped following the overnight weakness in U.S.
stocks, traders said. In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average
ended at 9,027.98, down 42.49 points.
	   In Tokyo, many investors took to the sidelines ahead of the
settlement of December futures and options Friday.
	   Participants also awaited upcoming economic events, including
the Bank of Japan's quarterly ``tankan'' business confidence survey
due out Monday, the formulation of the government budget for fiscal
1999 and a key policy-making U.S. Federal Reserve meeting later
this month.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
exchange's first section was down 2.12 points, or 0.19 percent, to
1,129.87. The TOPIX rose 6.99 points, or 0.62 percent, the previous
day.
	   On the foreign exchange market, dollar-buying sentiment was
dampened by the weakness on Wall Street as well as lingering
worries over the outlook for the U.S. economy, traders said.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond slipped to 1.050 percent from Monday's finish of 1.060
percent, pushing its price up to 106.47 yen from 106.38 yen.

NATO and Russia seek better cooperation in 1999

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO and Russia are trying to set aside
their differences as they consider political and military ties
ranging from arms control to NATO help in re-training Russian
officers for civilian life.
	   Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and his 16 NATO
counterparts sit down Wednesday to map out a common agenda for
1999, with both sides keen to signal their intent to enter the New
Year with a renewed spirit of cooperation.
	   Russia has agreed to allow NATO experts to investigate how the
year 2000 computer problem could affect Russia's defense systems.
NATO officials dismissed stories that the `millennium bug' could
cause Moscow's nuclear arms to go haywire, but they want to share
expertise with Russia to avoid such things as malfunctioning of
air-traffic control and early warning systems.
	   Wednesday's meeting comes at the close of a year marred by
conflicting views on what should be done to defuse the violence in
the separatist Serbian province of Kosovo.
	   Russia persistently opposed allied plans for airstrikes against
the Serbs unless Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic complied
with Western demands to cutback security forces in Kosovo. Russia
has religious and cultural ties to Serbia, the dominant republic in
Yugoslavia.
	   Relations between Moscow and NATO improved after a cease-fire
was negotiated. Russia has indicated it is willing to take part in
NATO's air surveillance mission over the province. That issue will
be on Wednesday's agenda, although Russia has yet to make a formal
proposal.
	   The NATO foreign ministers will brief Russia on their talks
Tuesday on updating alliance strategy for the 21st century.

NATO and Russia seek better cooperation in 1999

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO and Russia are trying to set aside
their differences as they consider political and military ties
ranging from arms control to NATO help in re-training Russian
officers for civilian life.
	   Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and his 16 NATO
counterparts sit down Wednesday to map out a common agenda for
1999, with both sides keen to signal their intent to enter the New
Year with a renewed spirit of cooperation.
	   Russia has agreed to allow NATO experts to investigate how the
year 2000 computer problem could affect Russia's defense systems.
NATO officials dismissed stories that the `millennium bug' could
cause Moscow's nuclear arms to go haywire, but they want to share
expertise with Russia to avoid such things as malfunctioning of
air-traffic control and early warning systems.
	   Wednesday's meeting comes at the close of a year marred by
conflicting views on what should be done to defuse the violence in
the separatist Serbian province of Kosovo.
	   Russia persistently opposed allied plans for airstrikes against
the Serbs unless Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic complied
with Western demands to cutback security forces in Kosovo. Russia
has religious and cultural ties to Serbia, the dominant republic in
Yugoslavia.
	   Relations between Moscow and NATO improved after a cease-fire
was negotiated. Russia has indicated it is willing to take part in
NATO's air surveillance mission over the province. That issue will
be on Wednesday's agenda, although Russia has yet to make a formal
proposal.
	   The NATO foreign ministers will brief Russia on their talks
Tuesday on updating alliance strategy for the 21st century.
	   The allied ministers laid the groundwork for the 50th
anniversary NATO summit in April in Washington. The summit will
welcome Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic as new members, over
Russia's objections.
	   The leaders are also expected to approve the revamped strategy
which should shift the focus from defending Western Europe from a
frontal assault to dealing with challenges from regional conflicts,
ethnic violence, terrorism and weapons of mass destruction.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said NATO must be

	   ``We agree that though the threats to our security and interests
have changed, the need for vigilance, vision and unity has not,''
Albright told a news conference.
	   ``Instability that is dangerous and contagious is best stopped

Clinton visit stirs pride and fury in squalid coastal strip
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Israel-Palestinians &QL; 
 &UR; By LAURA KING &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KHAN YOUNIS REFUGEE CAMP, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Squatting in the
dust and playing cards outside the hovel he calls home, Maher Alwah
thinks fate has dealt him an unlucky hand.
	   ``Here in Gaza, only God can help us,'' said the 32-year-old
Palestinian chicken vendor, whose family of 10 lives jammed into
two rooms. ``I don't believe anyone else will.''
	   In this crowded Mediterranean coastal strip, more than one-third
of whose 1.1 million people live in refugee camps, U.S. President
Bill Clinton's visit next week is being viewed with a mix of
anticipation and anger.
	   On the one hand, there is a certain pride over the first visit
ever by an American president to the Gaza Strip, a blighted
backwater whose main claim to fame is a long and remarkably
luckless history of defeat and conquest.
	   On the other, the sudden and unaccustomed glare of attention is
a unwelcome reminder of the humiliation and misery of daily life
here.
	   For that, most Palestinians place the blame squarely on Israel,
which occupied Gaza for nearly three decades after seizing it in
the 1967 war, and which remains an inescapable and much-hated
presence in the form of thousands of Israeli soldiers and Jewish
settlers.
	   The contrast between Israel, with a standard of living
comparable to that of many European countries, and Gaza, with its
intractable poverty and raging unemployment, provides constant fuel
for Palestinian fury.
	   ``Dogs in Israel live better than we do!'' said 50-year-old
Mohammed Wadi, another of the knot of men playing cards at midday
in the Khan Younis camp. ``You can't imagine what it's like to
bring up children here. Our lives are a bitter drink.''
	   ``You think we want to sit around in the dirt, wasting our
lives?'' burst out Alwah, the chicken vendor, who said his
now-and-then work neither fills his time nor feeds his family. ``No
one has a job! I couldn't get work as a garbage collector.''
	   Joblessness, which runs upwards of 50 percent in the camps, is
the central ill from which other woes radiate outward like the
spokes of a wheel, aid workers here say.
	   ``You can pump money into the place, but the situation isn't
going to improve substantially unless job creation exists,'' said
Ron Wilkinson, a spokesman for the United Nations Relief and Works
Agency.
	   Other than agriculture and a smattering of light manufacturing,
there are few job opportunities in Gaza. A new industrial park is
aimed at generating employment but for now the main cash flow is
from jobs in Israel _ mainly low-paying day labor, the arduous
daily journey to which is highly subject to political conditions.
	   Whenever trouble flares, Israel can clamp Gaza completely shut.
Unlike the West Bank, whose long and rugged border is virtually
impossible to seal, Gaza is surrounded by an electrified fence and
has only one crossing into Israel that workers can use.
	   While such so-called security closures of the Palestinian
territories have dropped sharply in the past year, their
unpredictability is a source of tremendous anxiety for the
Palestinians.
	   Particularly vulnerable are those whose livelihood depends on
the shipping of perishable goods _ which is to say, much of what
Gaza produces.
	   During a closure, strawberries rot, roses wilt, fresh fish spoil
_ and struggling business owners are consumed with frustration over
having their income turned off and on like a spigot.
	   The opening of Gaza's international airport last month _ an
outgrowth of the U.S.-brokered Wye River accords that Clinton is
seeking to bolster on this trip to Israel and the Palestinian lands
_ marked an important break in Gaza's suffocating isolation,
stemming from Israel's control of the borders, lack of a seaport
and the inability to travel freely to the West Bank.
	   Palestinians in Gaza say they are not surprised that Israel has
campaigned hard to prevent the president's plane from landing at
the new airport, because it so strongly symbolizes their
aspirations to statehood.
	   But in a conciliatory gesture toward Israel, Clinton will land
by helicopter and not in Air Force One.
	   By whatever means Clinton arrives in Gaza, many here view
Monday's visit as one step in a long journey.
	   Self-ruled since 1994, Gaza has served as microcosm and
laboratory in the Palestinians' painful process of learning
nationhood. Here, they are being forced to confront problems they
cannot entirely blame on the outside world, such as human rights
abuses and corruption.
	   Deib Jaha, a 40-year-old Palestinian potter who makes
traditional earthenware jugs for which Gaza was once famous, said
the Clinton visit should serve as a reminder that Palestinians'
best and real hopes lie with themselves.
	   ``His coming here opens a new era for us, but we are the ones
who have to consider what we will do next,'' Jaha said, carefully
spinning a beautifully curved vessel into shape on his potter's
wheel.
	   His family, natives of Gaza, were potters for four generations,
but their business withered during the six-year uprising, or
intefadeh, against Israeli rule. Slowly, Jaha has been trying to
rebuild it, teaching his son the family trade.
	   ``No one but Gazans know exactly how this kind of pot is made,
so in my own way, I'm helping to keep the history of Palestine
alive,'' he said. ``Doing this, I have my respect and dignity.
Nothing is more important than that.''

Legislator angry at delays in explanation of cousins' deaths
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALAN THORNHILL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Legislator Bob Sercombe is planning
to press for an explanation of the deaths of an Australian tourist
and his cousin in Greece last June.
	   Sercombe says he expects to raise the case in the nation's
Parliament before it adjourns for the holidays on Thursday.
	   Cousins George Karalis, 32, and George Loizos, 28, were both
found dead on their fishing dinghy near the Greek island of Evia on
June 3.
	   Within hours, local police had declared the crime a
murder-suicide.
	   But family members, who belong to the large Greek community in
Melbourne, do not accept that.
	   They suspect that the pair, close friends since childhood, ran
foul of drug smugglers who operate in the area.
	   Sercombe told The Associated Press that Greek authorities have
still not supplied details of the case that Melbourne Coroner
Graham Johnstone requested on June 16.
	   He said he would press Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs
and Trade, which has been seeking this information through
diplomatic channels, to push harder for this information.
	   Departmental spokesman Tony Melville said Australian authorities
have been told the investigation that the Greek police have been
conducting has now reached what he called ``a delicate stage.''
	   Sercombe is a member of Australia's opposition Labor party.
	   Loizos was born in Melbourne, but returned to Greece with his
family in 1978.
	   Karalis was visiting relatives in Greece at the time of his
death.

Gulf nations call for halt to oil over-production

<TEXT>
	   ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ Gulf Arab countries,
grappling with ways to halt the plunge in oil prices that has
gouged their budgets, called on oil-rich nations to stop
overprodution.
	   ``The whole problem'' of low oil prices is caused by countries
not sticking to their production quotas, said Jamil al-Hojeilan,
secretary-general of the Gulf Cooperation Council.
	   ``We hope that pledges to abide by agreed-upon quotas are
respected,'' he told the Middle East Broadcasting Corp., an Arab TV
network on Tuesday.
	   GCC leaders were entering the third and final day Wednesday of a
summit in Abu Dhabi dominated by the issue of bolstering oil prices
that have plummeted because of the recession in Asia and
warmer-than-usual winters.
	   GCC member-states _ Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar
and the Emirates _ sit on half the world's proven oil reserves and
depend on exports for 75 percent of their revenues.
	   Analysts say the top overproducers on the world stage are
outside the regional council: Venezuela, Iran and Indonesia. Only
Qatar, another main quota-buster according to analysts, is present
at the Abu Dhabi summit.
	   The GCC meeting comes less than two weeks after ministers from
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) failed to
agree on measures to halt the slide in prices.
	   The 11-member cartel announced no new steps after its year-end
meeting in Vienna, saying only that they would review the situation
in March.
	   Shortly before the GCC meeting began, January futures contracts
for Brent crude _ a widely watched benchmark _ fell to a record low
of dlrs 9.92 a barrel in London. Brent was selling for around dlrs
20 a barrel as recently as 1997.
	   The Gulf producers have been grappling with widening budget
deficits and problems paying foreign debts. Saudi Arabia, for
example, had projected a dlrs 4.8 billion budget deficit for 1998,
but analysts predict it will reach dlrs 15 billion.

Report: Rape, including of children, surges in Papua New Guinea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PORT MORESBY, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ The incidence of rape in
Papua New Guinea has risen dramatically and children as young as 10
years old are involved in gang rape, according to a report.
	   ``Rape has increased in PNG and has become extremely violent and
random,'' said the Papua New Guinea Law and Justice Baseline Survey
of Community Initiatives.
	   The report was released Wednesday by Australian aid agency
AusAID.
	   Pack rape was particularly violent and sometimes fatal.
	   ``An emerging trend in pack rape is the diverse ages of
offenders. Children as young as 10 are now involved,'' the report
said.
	   The report said accurate statistics were unavailable because
many cases go unreported.
	   ``However the number of rapes reported has increased
dramatically from 285 in 1980 to 1,896 in 1990,'' the report said.
	   The perceived inferior status of women promoted sexual violence,
and many women and girls had developed a fatalistic outlook and
believed that forced sexual intercourse must be accepted as part of
womanhood, it said.
	   Rape, especially pack rape, was a way of asserting male
superiority and solidarity, the report said.
	   Young, unemployed men involved in rape tried to justify their
actions by claiming lack of access to desirable women; an urge to
teach educated, liberated young women or girls a lesson; the
acceptability of a man sharing his girlfriend with other friends; a
payback for turning down a request for sexual intercourse; or the
influence of alcohol or drugs, according to the report.
	   It also said the incidence of rape was especially high in the
remote highlands, where it had become a common element in tribal
fighting.
	   The report said violence against women _ including rape and
assault _ was a consequence of a breakdown of traditional
constraints on men and the influence of the urban lifestyle.

	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Representatives from six Latin
American nations discussed a range of commercial and political
issues Tuesday, in preparation for the arrival of their countries'
presidents.
	   The Brazilian foreign ministry said the delegates from the
Mercosur common market nations would complete negotiations Tuesday,
and the heads of state would sign an agreement on Thursday.
	   The Southern Cone Common Market, or Mercosur, is a trade bloc
formed by Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay. Chile and
Bolivia are associate members.
	   Under discussion are issues ranging from tariffs on automobiles
to judicial and educational agreements, the foreign ministry said.
	   With the region headed for recession, the South American leaders
also are analyzing how the global crisis will effect trade and
commerce in their countries.

	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ The governor of Sao Paulo was submitted
to a battery of tests on Tuesday in preparation for surgery to
remove a malignant tumor in his bladder.
	   Governor Mario Covas, 68, a close ally of President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso, was hospitalized last week for the removal of a
non-cancerous tumor in the prostate gland. It was during this
surgery that doctors discovered the tumor in the bladder.
	   A bulletin distributed by the Heart Institute, said Covas
presented ``favorable clinical conditions.'' He is expected to
undergo surgery later this week, his doctor David Uip said.
	   Covas was re-elected to a second term in office in the
gubernatorial runoff elections on Oct. 25. With 34 million
inhabitants, Sao Paulo is Brazil's most populous. It is also the
nation's industrial and financial powerhouse, accounting for more
than one-third of Brazil's economic output.
	   Covas, who together with Cardoso was one of the founders of the
Brazilian Social Democracy Party, is expected to run for the
presidency in 2002.

	   ACAPULCO, Mexico (AP) _ A popular discotheque in the Pacific
Coast resort city of Acapulco has been destroyed by a fire.
	   No one was injured at the fire Tuesday afternoon at the
``Baby'O'' discotheque, though five firefighters were treated for
smoke inhalation. Fire Chief Lazaro Manuel Martinez said two
workers were doing soldering work on the building's facade when a
spark set off the fire, the government news agency Notimex
reported.
	   Firefighters took 1 1-2 hours to bring the blaze under control.
	   The 12-year-old discotheque was located on Acapulco's main hotel
strip and was popular with foreign and Mexican tourists.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexico City's mayor won't give Bolivian
President Hugo Banzer the keys to the city during an official visit
to Mexico this week _ the first time a visiting foreign head of
state will be denied the honor.
	   Mayor Cuauhtemoc Cardenas' office said his schedule was too
tight to meet Banzer. The newspaper El Universal, citing sources
close to Cardenas, reported that the mayor considers Banzer a
dictator.
	   David Bautista, counselor minister at the Bolivian Embassy, told
the newspaper La Jornada that the decision represented a
``regrettable situation.''
	   ___
	   SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) _ The presidential candidate for
a rebel group-turned-political party called Tuesday for El Salvador
to create an organization to support Salvadorans living in other
countries.
	   ``The government has never been interested in our community
abroad,'' Facundo Guardado, of the Farabundo Marti National
Liberation Front, said in front of the U.S. Embassy.
	   Some 1.2 million Salvadorans live in the United States, about
500,000 lack proper documents and are under constant threat of
deportation, he said. Together they contribute dlrs 1.2 billion a
year to El Salvador's economy.
	   Guardado, a former rebel fighter, called for creation of a
Support Institute for Salvadorans Abroad to promote local
development, ease the return of deported Salvadorans and foster
social and cultural ties between Salvadorans at home and abroad.
	   El Salvadorans, whose 13-year civil war ended in 1992, will
elect a new president on March 7, 1999.

Kosovo Albanians, Serbs agree: US peace plan unacceptable

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The United States and its allies are
urging both sides in the Kosovo conflict to compromise after Serbs
and ethnic Albanians rejected Washington's latest formula for
bringing peace to the troubled province.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright also criticized the
two sides, warning the Serbs to stop threats of new offensives and
telling the ethnic Albanians to abandon their ``rhetoric of
independence.''
	   Last week, U.S. envoy Christopher Hill offered a revised formula
for greater self-rule for Kosovo, a province of Yugoslavia's Serb
republic but with a majority ethnic Albanian population.
	   Both sides rejected the formula. A Serbian negotiator, Ratko
Markovic, said Tuesday the U.S. draft would require
``reconstructing the whole of Yugoslavia'' and would pave the way
for independence for ethnic Albanians.
	   The chief ethnic Albanian negotiator, Fehmi Agani, said the
proposal favored the Serbs. And Adem Demaci, chief spokesman of the
rebel Kosovo Liberation Army, suggested Tuesday that Hill should be
replaced.
	   ``Mr. Hill either doesn't understand the Albanian problems, or
he is leaning toward the Serbs,'' Demaci said. ``The State
Department should reconsider the results of his work ... (and) send
us more qualified people.''
	   Although the KLA is not a party to the deliberations, its
support is considered critical to ensuring that any future plan
actually brings peace to the province, where ethnic Albanians
outnumber Serbs 9-to-1.
	   Hundreds of people were killed and almost 300,000 ethnic
Albanians forced from their homes in a seven-month crackdown on
separatists by Serbian forces before an October peace accord.
	   The accord, reached under threat of NATO airstrikes, was seen as
a way to buy time for a diplomatic solution acceptable to both
Serbs and ethnic Albanians. But with little sign of progress, fears
are mounting that full-scale fighting could erupt, perhaps in the
spring, when snows will melt along the mountain passes to Albania,
where the rebels maintain sanctuaries.
	   In Brussels, Belgium, NATO foreign ministers endorsed U.S.
diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis and called on Serbs and
ethnic Albanians to ``move rapidly in a spirit of compromise and
accommodation.''
	   The ministers endorsed a plan that would give Kosovo ``a
substantially greater degree of autonomy and meaningful
self-administration'' but said any settlement must respect the
territorial integrity of Yugoslavia _ putting them at odds with
ethnic Albanians seeking independence.
	   The Americans and Europeans fear independence would lead to
similar demands by other ethnic Albanian communities elsewhere in
the southern Balkans.
	   ``Both Serb and Albanian leaders have made public statements
that do not help the cause of peace,'' Albright told reporters in
Brussels. ``Serb threats to launch a renewed offensive in Kosovo
are dangerous and we view them with extreme seriousness.''
	   Albright also said the ``Kosovo Albanian insistence on rhetoric
of independence and rejection of the ... draft agreement do have
help us to move forward.''

Survey: Australian minerals industry surviving crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Australia's minerals industry
continued to withstand the Asian crisis in the three months to
September with exports rising marginally to 10.84 billion
Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 6.72 billion).
	   The government's chief commodities forecaster said Wednesday
that export earnings in the minerals and energy sector rose by 97
million Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 60 million) in the quarter,
or just under one per cent.
	   But the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics
said imports were also up by 276 million Australian dollars (U.S.
dlrs 171 million), or 12.4 percent, to 2.503 billion Australian
dollars (U.S. dlrs 1.55 billion) in the September quarter.
	   ``This strong performance reflected mixed results for minerals
and energy commodities in difficult trading conditions, with strong
increases in earnings in some commodities offsetting significant
falls in other commodities,'' said ABARE director Brian Fisher
	   The biggest rise in export earnings came for crude oil, up 17
percent to 598 million Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 371 million).
	   Export earnings also rose for iron ore, steaming coal, aluminum,
liquefied natural gas, refined gold, zinc, and gems.
	   But export earnings fell for iron and steel, nickel, copper,
uranium oxide, petroleum refinery products, lead, and alumina.
	   ``Lower export volumes and unit returns contributed to most of
the falls,'' it said.
	   ``Other commodities to exhibit falls included diamonds,
ferroalloys, magnesia, liquefied petroleum gas, tin, ilmenite and
natural rutile.''
	   Production of uranium soared by 62 percent, manganese by 72
percent, lead by 20 percent, zinc and silver, both by 12 percent,
and natural gas by 5 percent.
	   Refined production of gold spiked upwards by 58 percent in the
quarter joined by a 13 percent rise in production of silver.
	   Production falls were seen for refined tin, refined copper and
diamonds.

Famous Paris nightclub offers cabaret for kids
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ In the front row, one toddler waved frantically in
recognition as Santa burst onto the stage, joining a dance line
with showgirls in feather headdresses and G-strings.
	   The Lido, Paris's famous cabaret, is best known for its topless
showgirls in sequins and stilettos. This year it's adding something
different _ a Christmas revue for kids.
	   ``We thought, why not?'' said Marie-Jo Andria, of the Lido's
press office. ``We had the technical effects in place to make a
great kids' show _ the lights, the ice for skating, the trapezes.''
	   The kids' show is slightly toned down. Dancers wear tights. Fur
halter tops cover bare breasts.
	   And though the dancers still showed a lot of skin, parents
aren't shocked. After all, this is Paris, where the female body is
considered artistic, not tawdry. Beautiful bodies figure
prominently on billboards and on television commercials, selling
everything from yogurt to blue jeans.
	   ``Oh, it was really lovely, quite well done,'' said Nathalie
Pascale, accompanying her daughter, 6-year-old Antonella.
	   The Champs-Elysees nightclub, filled with children and their
grandparents, could have been a Disneyland theater, with its red
beaded curtains and glass-drop chandeliers.
	   Before the show, foam snowflakes wafted onto the audience, and
French folk songs played on the loudspeaker.
	   Antonella raced up to the balcony's edge for a better view
during the first scenes.
	   ``I loved the costumes, and I loved it when they were skating,''
she said afterward.
	   In 1995, the Lido spent 70 million francs (dlrs 14 million) on a
major facelift, hoping to shed its image as nightlife for
middle-aged tourists. The children's revue is part of the Lido's
effort to branch out.
	   Tickets for the matinee, which runs until Jan. 10, cost 130 to
160 francs (dlrs 23 to 29.)
	   The revue tells the story of Ophelie, a young girl on her way to
Santa's Christmas fete. It alludes to tales like Cinderella, Alice
in Wonderland and Snow White.
	   But in this rendition, the chronically late white rabbit has a
sex-bunny wife in stiletto heels. And the evil queen with a magic
mirror has a leather-clad entourage of long-haired ``love slaves.''

Security Council denounces Afghanistan for sheltering terrorists
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.N. Security Council denounced
Afghanistan's Taliban militia Tuesday for sheltering international
terrorists and violating human rights.
	   The council warned Taliban leaders that it would impose
unspecified measures against them unless they halt their military
campaign and negotiate peace with their ethnic rivals in the
northern part of the country.
	   Alarmed by what it called the increasingly ethnic nature of the
conflict, the council unanimously adopted a resolution condemning
the killings this summer of eight Iranian diplomats and an Iranian
journalist and the reported massacre of several thousand minority
Shiites during the Taliban sweep of northern Afghanistan.
	   It demanded that the Taliban stop providing sanctuary and
training for international terrorists.
	   ``Afghanistan-based terrorism has become a plague,'' said U.S.
envoy Nancy Soderberg. ``Terrorists trained or based in Afghanistan
have been responsible for incidents in all corners of the globe.
This was brought home to us tragically by the bombing of our
embassies'' in August in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar Es Salaam,
Tanzania.
	   The Taliban have refused to hand over Osama bin Laden, the
multimillionaire Saudi dissent who lives in Afghanistan and is
accused by the United States of masterminding the embassy bombings
that killed 224 people, including 12 Americans. Taliban leaders
deny his involvement in terrorism.
	   The Security Council also accused the Taliban of human rights
violations, supporting drug trafficking and hampering international
aid delivery. It urged the militia to guarantee the safety of aid
workers and U.N. personnel.
	   The resolution follows a report last month by U.N. Secretary
General Kofi Annan that expressed concerns over human rights
violations, including the Taliban's discriminatory policies against
women and lack of cooperation with aid groups.
	   The Taliban, which control most of Afghanistan, follow a strict
version of Islam that bars women from work and education, forces
men to wear beards and bans all light entertainment, including
music.
	   The council backed Annan's recommendation that a civilian
affairs unit be established to monitor the situation in Afghanistan
and promote respect for minimum human rights standards.
	   The resolution, sponsored by Russia, which along with Iran
reportedly backs anti-Taliban forces in northern Afghanistan,
called on the militia to negotiate peace with the opposition.
	   The only support for the Taliban came from Pakistan, which is
reportedly the main financial and military backer of the religious
movement.
	   ``The overall tone of the resolution is biased against one
group, which is not good for the image of the United Nations, or
the Security Council for that matter, as an impartial player,''
said Pakistan's Ambassador Ahmad Kamal, who lauded the Taliban for
their success in bringing peace to most of Afghanistan.

Prosecutors question Suharto about corruption allegations
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos staffing &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Under tight security, former President
Suharto fielded queries Wednesday from government prosecutors about
allegations of corruption during his 32-year authoritarian rule.
	   The 77-year-old ex-army general smiled and waved at staff
members after pulling up in a Mercedes jeep at the Jakarta High
Attorney's office, which was heavily guarded by riot police.
	   Several small tanks were parked nearby but there was no sign of
the student protesters who have been pressing for months for a
trial of Suharto on charges of corruption and human rights abuses.
	   The students helped force him out of power in May amid political
turmoil and hardship caused by the worst economic crisis in decades
in the Southeast Asian nation of 202 million people.
	   Suharto had been expected to appear at the office of Attorney
General Andi Mohammad Ghalib, who is conducting an investigation of
his wealth, estimated by Forbes magazine at dlrs 4 billion.
	   The change of venue to the Jakarta prosecutors' office was
apparently a ruse designed to foil students who have frequently
staged protests at Ghalib's office and occupied it for one day last
month.
	   Suharto, now a virtual recluse in his Jakarta home, was
accompanied by several men, including his lawyer. The former
president wore traditional Indonesian clothing he often appeared in
while in office: a batik shirt and a black cap.
	   In recent weeks, students have stepped up protests after an
earlier government inquiry of Suharto found no evidence of
wrongdoing.
	   Critics said that the probe by Ghalib was a whitewash. Now under
pressure, Suharto's successor and one-time protege, President B.J.
Habibie, has ordered Ghalib to try again.
	   Suharto scoffs at accusations that he stashed billions of
dollars overseas and claims he has ``not one cent'' squirreled away
in foreign bank accounts.
	   Also Wednesday, Mohamad ``Bob'' Hasan, a former trade and
industry minister, appeared at the attorney general's office for
questioning about corruption allegations.
	   Hasan, a one-time golfing buddy of Suharto, is a business tycoon
with big interests in the timber industry.

	   SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) _ With the bulk of their construction
work behind them, Endeavour's astronauts gave the new
up-and-running space station a safe but shaky lift to a higher
orbit on Tuesday.
	   The pilots fired the shuttle thrusters to climb to an altitude
of about 248 miles, 5{ miles higher than before.
	   NASA wants to leave the international space station in as high
an orbit as possible. Spacecraft gradually sink because of the
naturally occurring drag of the atmosphere, and need to be boosted
periodically.
	   The seven-story, 35-ton station swung back and forth a half-foot
or more in Endeavour's cargo bay, its solar wings flapping, as the
shuttle moved higher and higher.
	   ``Wow, look at that,'' astronaut Nancy Currie called to her
crewmates. The tips of the wings waved a full foot, she said.
	   The astronauts kept close watch on the quivering stack during
the 20-minute ride, carefully spacing out their thruster pulses to
reduce the stress.
	   ``Nice job,'' Mission Control said when it was over. Shuttle
commander Robert Cabana replied that the boosting procedure
``really worked slick.''
	   It went so well, in fact, that Mission Control canceled a second
boost that had been planned for Friday.
	   After the previous night's 7{-hour spacewalk to wire the Zarya
and Unity station modules together, the astronauts took it easy
Tuesday. It was their first break since rocketing into orbit last
Friday.
	   ``We've still got a lot ahead of us,'' Cabana told a TV
interviewer, ``but it really feels good to have everything we need
for mission success under our belt. It's really been an outstanding
flight.''
	   As the astronauts relaxed, flight controllers took up the slack,
monitoring all systems aboard the space station. Unity, the
American-made side, came to life for the first time in orbit late
Monday after spacewalkers hooked up 40 electrical connections.
	   The Unity connecting chamber was right around the freezing point
when its heaters kicked on. The 36-foot cylinder should be warm
enough by the time the six shuttle astronauts venture inside on
Thursday, said NASA's lead flight director, Bob Castle. The
astronauts will spruce up Unity and Zarya, and drop off clothes for
the first permanent crew, due to arrive in early 2000.
	   Unity's fans and computers also were purring.
	   ``We put the skeleton together of the beginnings of the space
station'' on Sunday, Castle said after power and data began flowing
between Unity and Zarya. ``Today we hooked up the first parts of
the nervous system.''
	   Unlike the Russian-built Zarya control module, which gets its
energy from the sun, Unity lacks solar wings and so must rely on
Zarya for power. Unity also lacks a communication system, but not
for long.
	   Spacewalkers Jerry Ross and James Newman will go out again
Wednesday to attach two 100-pound antennas to Unity. That way, NASA
won't have to rely on Russia's Mission Control to communicate with
the segment.
	   A third and final spacewalk is set for Saturday.

Tyson not talking about legal problems
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous; CORRECTS spelling of Goossen in 23rd graf &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHN NADEL &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES _ If Mike Tyson is concerned about a possible return
to prison, he wasn't saying Tuesday.
	   Looking fit in a black muscle T-shirt and wearing a crimson
beret, Tyson appeared for a news conference called to announce what
promoter Dan Goossen called the worst-kept secret in boxing _ that
Tyson will face Francois Botha on Jan. 16.
	   The 12-round bout at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, to be carried
on Showtime Event Television Pay Per View, will be Tyson's first
since June 28, 1997 when he bit Evander Holyfield's ears in their
heavyweight championship bout and was disqualified in the third
round.
	   Shortly thereafter, the Nevada Athletic Commission stripped
Tyson of his boxing license and fined him dlrs 3 million. The
commission reinstated Tyson's license in October.
	   Even before Tyson spoke at the packed Hollywood Athletic Club
news conference, adviser Shelly Finkel informed attending reporters
and fans that questions wouldn't be answered regarding ``any
pending litigation.''
	   The first questioner asked Tyson how he felt about a possible
return to prison, and was shouted down by others on the dais.
	   Appearing more relaxed and glib than usual, Tyson then responded
to questions _ sometimes with flippant, sarcastic answers, other
times with more thoughtful responses.
	   ``I'm not much for talking,'' he said in a one-minute
presentation before questions began. ``You guys know what I do. I
know no one believes that he (Botha) is going to beat me.''
	   Asked what round he'd stop Botha, he replied, ``Come to the
fight, brother.''
	   Another questioner asked about a possible future opponent, to
which Tyson replied, ``If the price is right, I'll fight a lion.''
	   He also said, ``I'm not here because I've been voted the nicest
guy in the world. I'm just here to give good fights, be a good
boy.''
	   And about the 30-year-old Botha, Tyson said, ``Let's be nice to
this guy, let's all be nice.''
	   Tyson has a 45-3 record with 39 knockouts, while Botha is 39-1
with 24 knockouts.
	   Botha's only loss came on Nov. 9, 1996 when he was stopped by
Michael Moorer in the ninth round for the IBF heavyweight title.
Botha has fought just twice this year, stopping two unheralded
opponents in the first round.
	   Earlier in the day in Indianapolis, the judge who could return
Tyson to prison said she will await his February sentencing on
Maryland assault charges before making a decision.
	   Judge Patricia Gifford followed a recommendation from probation
officer George Walker, who said in a probation report it ``may be
desirable to await the outcome'' of misdemeanor assault charges
against Tyson in Maryland.
	   Tyson pleaded no contest there last week. The Montgomery County
District Court in Maryland has set Feb. 5 for sentencing, said
James Voyles, Tyson's Indianapolis lawyer.
	   Tyson served three years for rape in Indiana, and Gifford will
decide whether he violated terms of his 1995 parole. Two motorists
said he kicked and punched them after an automobile accident in
Maryland in August.
	   ``Everyone knows I'm on parole, I'm trying to be nice up here,''
Tyson said during the news conference. ``I'm just here to fight,
one fight at a time. I don't want no trouble from anyone.''
	   Botha, pretty much shoved to the background, said he felt
honored to have the opportunity to face Tyson, an opportunity he
said he has been awaiting his entire life.
	   ``He's in for a rude awakening, that's all I can say,'' Botha
said. ``I come to fight, I don't come to lay down, and that's what
I intend to do.''
	   Following the news conference, Goossen, president of America
Presents, said it wasn't his job to concern himself with Tyson's
possible legal problems.
	   ``His lawyers are handling that,'' said Goossen, promoting a
Tyson fight for the first time. ``I'm a boxing promoter. My
energies have to go strictly toward the promotion.
	   ``I'm working toward Jan. 16, that's it. I don't think about it
one way or another. My answer is simply, we have to prepare for
Jan. 16.''
	   Goossen also said, ``Mike Tyson's the biggest act in show
business.''

	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ For months, investors warned that Hugo
Chavez was a dictator-in-waiting who would plunge Venezuela into
economic chaos.
	   But on the first day of trading since the former coup leader was
elected president, stocks soared a breathtaking 22 percent Tuesday.
	   At least so far, Chavez is surprising those who expected the
worst after his landslide victory on Sunday.
	   International election observers ``thought they would meet a
gorilla and instead met rational human beings capable of offering
solutions in democracy and peace,'' Chavez said Tuesday.
	   His conciliatory comments have soothed the fears of investors
nervous he would roll back free market economic policies.
	   ``The market is giving him the benefit of the doubt,'' said
Ricardo Penfold, vice president of research at Santander investment
bank in Caracas.
	   ``But he still has to deliver with sound economic policies and a
new cabinet that has as much credibility as he has gained in only
two days.''
	   Analysts cautioned that Tuesday's financial exuberance could be
short-lived because of the oil-rich nation's deep economic woes.
Markets were closed Monday for a holiday.
	   Low oil prices have forced the government to slash the budget by
some dlrs 2 billion this year. The budget deficit is estimated at
dlrs 3 billion to dlrs 3.5 billion, and it is expected to balloon
to dlrs 5 billion in 1999.
	   After growing by more than 5 percent in 1997, the economy is
expected to shrink 1 percent this year.
	   Business leaders are concerned that Chavez's call for a new
constitution could divert attention away from the pressing economic
problems.
	   But in general, his pleas for ``magnanimity in victory'' and
``strict fiscal discipline'' have been remarkably well-received in
the business community.
	   He has pledged to slash Venezuela's notoriously bloated
bureaucracy, jail tax evaders and launch a frontal attack on
corruption.
	   ``We are advancing toward a situation of full confidence and
that is going to ease the startup of our government,'' Chavez, 44,
said Tuesday. ``As president-elect, I'm guaranteeing judicial
security and respect for investments.''
	   His victory was a major blow to the political and economic
establishment that has ruled Venezuela during 40 years of
democracy. The campaign polarized the country between the poor who
idolize Chavez and the rich who predicted the cashiered lieutenant
colonel would impose a dictatorship.
	   The former paratrooper, who tried to overthrow the government in
1992, rode a wave of fierce public anger over rampant corruption
and declining living standards.
	   Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, who was in Venezuela as an
election observer, called Sunday's vote a ``peaceful revolution.''
	   Even the United States, which has denied Chavez a tourist visa
because of the attempted coup, congratulated him ``on his
impressive victory'' and indicated it would review the visa denial.
	   Basking in the honeymoon, Chavez spent his first 48 hours as
president-elect darting to meetings with advisors, business leaders
and diplomats.
	   He gave a two-hour press conference Sunday night and followed it
with a rousing midnight speech to thousands of supporters who had
waited hours in the street.
	   By early the next morning, Chavez was back on TV being
interviewed.
	   Within hours of his win, Chavez had named Gen. Raul Salazar
defense minister. By Tuesday the general had left his post in
Washington, D.C. as Venezuela's defense attache and was meeting
with Chavez and defense officials in Caracas.
	   His appointment was expected to ease tensions in the military,
where some officials have threatened to oppose Chavez's rise to the
presidency. Salazar is viewed as a respected leader who can unify
the armed forces.

Economists say tougher economic choices are ahead for Russia

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Nearly four months after Russia's financial
markets imploded, getting money out of the bank sometimes requires
hopping on a jet.
	   Some foreign companies, unable to establish working accounts in
Russia's convulsed banks, fly executives to Europe to withdraw tens
of thousands of dollars in cash, which the nervous businessmen then
hand-carry into Russia in their briefcases.
	   It's a process that often has to be repeated every few weeks.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov's government has brought a
measure of economic stability following this summer's dramatic
crash, which was linked to a broader meltdown that also wiped out
emerging markets in Asia.
	   But there are signs aplenty that conditions could again worsen
quite soon _ the ruble is sliding, fuel shortages plague many
regions and Russia is starved for foreign loans that have kept it
afloat for years.
	   ``You will not find anyone arguing in favor of economic growth
next year,'' Jan Lundin, executive director of the Russia-European
Center for Economic Policy, said at a news conference Tuesday.
	   The economy, which will shrink about 5 percent this year, is
expected to contract 3 percent to 9 percent next year, according to
the Finance Ministry. Many private economists say conditions are
simply too volatile and unpredictable to even offer a guess.
	   The country is not even close to resolving key questions such as
how to revive the enfeebled banking system. Russia still has about
1,500 banks, but many are closed or barely function, and no more
than half are expected to survive, the government has said.
	   And with its coffers bare, Russia's government is again facing a
painful choice: should it allow millions of workers to go without
wages, or print piles of money to pay them and watch inflation go
through the roof?
	   The country's economic options are so constrained these days
that choosing hyperinflation may be about the best it can do.
	   Ordinary Russians have shown extraordinary patience in recent
years despite regularly receiving wages months late. Many survive
by working in a parallel economy that involves growing vegetables
on small garden plots, bartering when they don't have cash, and
taking informal jobs, such as hiring themselves out as drivers.
	   But government payments could become even more irregular in
coming months as Russia's cash sources dry up.
	   The government has been without foreign loans since the crisis
hit, and the chronic problem of collecting taxes has only grown
worse.
	   ``Russia is now effectively cut off from non-inflationary
financing,'' said economist Peter Westin of the Russia-European
Center.
	   That leaves the government with only one real option _ printing
money. This is certain to fuel an inflation rate that will be
around 70 percent this year, and there are widespread fears the
country could return to the days of the early 1990s, when inflation
was regularly over 100 percent a year.
	   Since the crisis, the government has shown more restraint than
many predicted. But next year's budget is heavily dependent on
foreign loans that are unlikely to materialize. Even government
economists suspect the proposed budget may not be realistic.
	   ``Experience tells us that the budget that's approved and the
budget that's actually fulfilled are two different things,'' said
economist Vladimir Mau of the government's Working Center for
Economic Reform.
	   Russia has already indicated that it won't be able to pay off
all of the dlrs 17.5 billion in foreign debt that falls due next
year. Those debts, part of nearly dlrs 150 billion in overall
foreign debts, will probably have to be re-negotiated.
	   If foreign lenders write off billions dollars in bad loans to
Russia, they aren't likely to hand out additional money anytime
soon.
	   The IMF has frozen a dlrs 22.6 billion bailout package, and
until the IMF acts, most other lenders are also expected to stay on
the sidelines.
	   Writing about Russia's economic debacle, the IMF expert on
Russia, John Odling Smee, said the government hurt itself by
granting ``widespread tax exemptions to its friends and (failing)
to pursue tax evaders aggressively.''
	   ``This policy, together with the government's willingness to
run-up arrears, contributed in an important way to a culture of
non-payments and barter which spread throughout the economy.''

Prime minister vows to pursue economic reform, fight corruption
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DENIS D. GRAY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Warning Thailand has yet to emerge from
crisis, Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai pledged to forge ahead with
wide-ranging reforms and fight the massive corruption which
undermined one of the world's fastest growing economies.
	   ``Our highest priority remains getting the economy going again
through continued financial and corporate restructuring,'' he told
the Foreign Correspondents Club of Thailand on Tuesday night.
	   Chuan said the situation remained ``fragile'' and global factors
could veer Thailand from its target of turning the economic corner
by the second half of 1999.
	   He cited the danger of weak foreign demand and thus lower
domestic prices in agriculture, a backbone of the Thai economy and
source of employment for millions.
	   ``The crisis mentality we inherited has subsided. There is no
longer talk of a weak baht (currency) and capital flight,'' he
said. ``But despite these positive developments ... much more still
remains to be done.''
	   In the coming year, Chuan said, his government would increase
fiscal spending to support the agricultural sector, render more
help to small and medium sized enterprises and complete a
comprehensive financial restructuring aimed at reviving the
battered banking sector.
	   This package includes resolving a massive corporate debt,
recapitalizing the banking sector and providing greater liquidity
to the industrially productive real sector.
	   In one of his strongest attacks on corruption and cronyism,
which sapped the robust economy of both cash and political will,
Chuan vowed to fight the vote-buying which propelled corrupt and
sometimes criminal figures into politics.
	   ``The practice of vote-buying undermines the very moral fabric
of our society and is the root cause of corruption in our
country,'' he said. ``People who buy their way into public office
will invariably use their position to recoup their investment.''
	   While Chuan is regarded as one of the country's cleanest
politicians, his nearly two-year-old government has been riddled by
scandal. Corrupt practices are common in virtually every sector of
society, with the rich and powerful often getting away with theft
of public funds, and sometimes murder.
	   ``I can assure you that every Thai will be equal before the law.
There will be no exceptions,'' Chuan said. ``Scandals will be
investigated and not left to just fade away as in the past.''
	   But Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda, who also attended
the dinner speech, and Chuan said Thailand would carry through on
even unpopular reform measures, which have sparked some protests
that the country was losing economic independence by opening up to
foreign ownership of private and public enterprises.
	   ``I apologize on behalf of anyone who has used anti-foreign
rhetoric, but we cannot expect 60 million Thais to agree on
everything,'' Chuan said. ``Charges that we want to sell off the
country are unfounded.''
	   Chuan added: ``Indeed, it is not unlike the fear of Japanese
investments in in and dominance of America during the 1980s _ a
fear which proved to be unfounded.''

Violence, corruption plague Mexican border city of Tijuana
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo NY190 &QL; 
 &UR; By MICHELLE RAY ORTIZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TIJUANA, Mexico (AP) _ On the border in northwestern Mexico,
Tijuana sits between the haves and the have-nots: those in Mexico
who have cocaine, marijuana, heroin and speed, and those in the
United States who do not but will pay lots for it.
	   Small-time dealers cook speed, or methamphetamine, in backroom
labs hidden in poor neighborhoods. Big-time traffickers tally their
profits behind guarded fortresses. Others in this border city of 2
million people just do their best to keep out of the line of fire.
	   Every 30 hours, on average, violence claims another life in this
gritty metropolis or in the barren deserts nearby _ the
overwhelming majority of them connected to the smuggling of drugs,
arms or undocumented workers.
	   Some fear Tijuana is on the edge of becoming the new Medellin,
the Colombian city that fell into chaotic drug violence in the
1980s and early '90s.
	   Tijuana newspaper publisher Jesus Blancornelas said Tijuana has
not yet seen the level of violence that characterized Medellin, but
added: ``I can't deny that at any moment it could happen.''
	   The city, home to the busiest border crossing on Earth, is one
of the main ports of entry for drugs heading into the United States
_ the world's largest drug market. U.S. officials seized more than
188 tons of drugs worth an estimated dlrs 308 million at the five
Mexico-California border crossings in the 1998 fiscal year _ up 44
percent from the previous year.
	   Along the 2,000-mile (3,220-kilometer) border, homicides this
year have hit record levels near drug passage points: 156 in
Tamaulipas state, 49 in Chihuahua, and 216 in Sinaloa, not a border
state but a prime trafficking center, according to the Binational
Center of Human Rights, an independent Tijuana group.
	   The fragile balance that had checked drug violence in the past
was upset by the July 1997 death of Amado Carillo Fuentes, who led
a powerful cocaine smuggling cartel based in Ciudad Juarez, across
the border from El Paso, Texas.
	   In Tijuana, big-time trading still is firmly controlled by the
Arellano Felix brothers, whose group brings multi-ton drug
shipments into the western United States and beyond to Chicago,
Kentucky, Ohio and New York.
	   Yet struggles between mid-level and emerging dealers have made
1998 the bloodiest on record for the city, according to Victor
Clark, director of the human rights center.
	   ``It has provoked a feeling of uncertainty, of insecurity along
the border,'' he said.
	   In September, a hit squad pulled an alleged marijuana trafficker
and 18 of his relatives from their beds and killed them in El
Sauzal, 45 miles (70 kilometers) south of Tijuana. In October,
young men with a Kalashnikov assault rifle killed six strangers and
wounded a seventh in what police say was a drugged, thrill-seeking
spree.
	   Fear keeps middle-class people from going out at night and
private bodyguard services and security companies are booming.
	   ``This was never seen on the border before,'' Clark said. ``This
is new in Tijuana.''
	   Yet the city long has borne an outlaw reputation _ at least for
foreigners. For decades, Americans have dipped south of the border
for prostitution and gambling. Every weekend, college students
taking advantage of Mexico's rarely enforced drinking age of 18
down cheap shots of tequila in its garish discos.
	   More than 200,000 foreigners visited Tijuana last year. But many
who cruised the stalls of rough-hewn blankets and leather goods on
Avenida Revolucion one afternoon were careful not to venture too
far.
	   ``We've been on edge here,'' said Joina Kavvadas, an Australian
tourist.
	   The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration said last year that
almost 90 percent of police officers, prosecutors and judges in
Tijuana and in the state of Baja California were reportedly on the
Arellano Felix payroll.
	   Witnesses have said the brothers pay up to dlrs 1 million a week
in bribes to federal, state and local officials.
	   But one DEA offcial said Tijuana's violence is not as bad as
Medellin once was _ simply because the Arellano Felix organization
is so dominant. The Colombian city, caught in a war between two
rival cartels, saw daily outbursts of violence.
	   ``I served 2 1/2 years in Colombia,'' said Errol Chavez, the
DEA's special agent in San Diego. ``I know Medellin. This is not
Medellin.''
	   He called the bulk of the violence around Tijuana
``house-cleaning'' _ drug traffickers seeking retribution for debts
or deals gone bad.
	   Still, a year ago, gunmen waiting outside the federal court
building in Tijuana ambushed and killed two Mexican military men
after the arrest of a high-ranking member of the Arellano Felix
group.
	   The DEA says bribery and corruption may be why Baja California
state police withdrew the protection squad assigned to
Blancornelas, the newspaper publisher, who then was shot in
November 1997 and barely survived.
	   Blancornelas, who continues to take on drug-traffickers and
corrupt police in his Zeta weekly, now arrives at his guarded
offices in a bulletproof vest, surrounded by bodyguards toting
assault rifles. But he does not blame his beloved city.
	   ``Our biggest problem is geographic,'' he said. ``We are in a
place that is both privileged and unfortunate.''
	   While Tijuana's proximity to the United States has fueled the
growth of the manufacturing plants that keep the city's employment
rate high, it lies right in the path for drug trafficking. On top
of that, hundreds of Mexicans and Central Americans arrive daily
looking to cross illegally into the United States.
	   Few see any quick remedy for Tijuana.
	   ``This is not a war that has reached the levels of Colombia, but
it is the start of another Colombia,'' said Clark, the human rights
advocate.

Shrinking Syrian Orthodox community tries to hang on
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By ANN S. KIM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A curtain opens, revealing three monks and a
priest circling an altar. Incense and chants in Aramaic, the
ancient language of Jesus, fill the dark space. The gilt of the
altar and the priest's cape shine in the candlelight.
	   In the empty chapel, the Syrian Orthodox clerics face the altar
and kiss the brass chains of the incense shaker and the
silver-covered Bible. Toward the end of Mass, a lone member of the
congregation enters to offer prayers and take communion with them.
	   The Syrian Orthodox community of Jerusalem is shrinking. Only
about 150 families remain in the holy city, compared to about 2,000
before the 1948 Mideast war.
	   Emigration continues to whittle away at the congregation, which
doesn't have enough clergymen to celebrate Mass daily and has cut
back to three a week.
	   As the numbers dwindle, fewer and fewer among the younger
generation speak Aramaic even though church leaders feel it is
their sacred duty to keep the language of Jesus alive.
	   ``We believe it is a holy language, consecrated by our Lord
Jesus Christ for 2,000 years,'' says the Rev. Shemun Can, speaking
in a sunny monastery courtyard outside the chapel in Jerusalem's
walled Old City.
	   The Syrian Orthodox Church has about 2.5 million followers
worldwide, nearly 2 million of them in India's southern state of
Kerala, where the Christian community aligned itself with the
Syrian church in 1644. The rest are scattered about the Middle
East, Europe and the Americas.
	   Some 500,000 to 800,000 people, mainly in the Middle East and
Europe, speak dialects of Aramaic.
	   There have been some efforts to teach the language to young
people. But the 3,000-year-old language is likely to die out within
two or three decades, says Moshe Bar-Asher, president of the
Academy of Hebrew Language in Jerusalem.
	   Elie Kouz, owner of a ceramics shop in the Christian Quarter of
the Old City, studied Aramaic as a young man in a monastery in
preparation for the priesthood.
	   ``I can read, but I cannot understand what it means,'' Kouz
says, noting Aramaic is generally not used outside church services
in Jerusalem.
	   He says he wishes his 11-year-old daughter understood more than
just a few words and expressions used in prayers.
	   ``I believe, in 10 years, if my community doesn't open a school,
I think slowly, slowly the Aramaic language will be finished in the
Middle East and will be only for the monks,'' Kouz says.
	   About 40 families among the city's Syrian Orthodox have begun
saving money in hopes of buying land and building a housing
development in the Beit Hanina neighborhood in traditionally Arab
east Jerusalem.
	   Such a project, they say, could draw together church members now
scattered around the city and help stem the wave of emigration that
has engulfed not only the Syrian Orthodox but other Palestinian
Christian communities in the Holy Land.
	   Church member Johnny Ozgul, who has seen most of his friends
emigrate over the years, says a small church could be built as part
of the Beit Hanina project.
	   More people would come to Mass then, he says, sitting in his
silversmith shop where a card bearing the Lord's Prayer in Aramaic
hangs over crowded cases. ``Nobody will have the excuse of `It's
too far away.' These are our excuses.''
	   But the future of the housing project is uncertain. The
community has found neither the land nor the money to buy it.
	   Kouz, the owner of the ceramics shop, says only heavenly
intervention can help now. ``Maybe if there's a miracle, they can
do it.''

Foreign minister: Misguided notion of Asian values
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ For too long people in Asia had clung
to a misguided notion of Asian values to justify clamping down on
democratic movements, Foreign Affairs Minister Alexander Downer
said Wednesday.
	   Speaking at a human rights conference in Sydney, Downer said
they had also used so-called Asian values as an excuse for
preventing the evolution of an open civil society.
	   ``For too long there have been people in Asia and elsewhere who
have clung to the misguided notion of Asian values as a
justification for clamping down on democratic movements or the
natural inclination of people to participate in the democratic
process,'' he told the conference.
	   ``They have also used so-called Asian values as an excuse for
not allowing for an appropriate evolution of an open, civil
society.
	   ``It is only an open civil society which can be inclusive
tolerant and truly outward looking.''
	   Downer did not make any reference in his speech to the treatment
of indigenous Australians.
	   When asked by reporters later what steps could be taken to
improve relations with Aborigines, he said he was not the minister
for Aboriginal affairs.
	   ``In an international context Australia is recognized as a
country which has respect for human rights, both internationally
and domestically,'' he said.
	   ``That's not to say that anyone ever claimed we were perfect.''

Penury and peril mark life in Ugandan town on lush border
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUNDIBUGYO, Uganda (AP) _ The nights are dark on Bundibugyo's
unpaved main street but for the light from a window that pulsates
to the hum of a small electric generator.
	   It beckons the few passers-by in this quiet, impoverished border
town into the Hotel Pickering where cold beer is served until
midnight, and a TV is plugged in each evening to pull down Cable
News Network and British Broadcasting Corp. via a satellite dish on
the roof.
	   Bundibugyo's few educated residents devour the newscasts along
with their beers, and realize how isolated they are from the rest
of their impoverished but developing country _ and from the rest of
the world.
	   ``It's all about Kosovo _ and Lewinsky,'' mutters one patron,
complaining that no one talks about the thousands of people
displaced by rebel attacks in Uganda and by civil war in Congo,
just a stone's throw away.
	   Bundibugyo perches on the edge of western Uganda, the last
important settlement at the end of a meandering dirt road.
	   The only road to the rest of Uganda, and the closest town, Fort
Portal, wraps around the northern edge of the staggeringly steep
Rwenzori Mountains. It turns to impassable mud when it rains.
	   The mountains that straddle the border with Congo soar to
clouded heights of more than 5,000 meters (16,500 feet). They grace
Bundibugyo with a lush green backdrop, as beautiful as they are
ominous. Ugandan rebels creep in the thickly forested slopes.
	   From time to time, the guerrillas come down from their mountain
bases inside Congo and cross into Uganda to steal, maim and kill.
In June 1997, they attacked Bundibugyo. Government soldiers fought
back, and dozens of people died.
	   Thousands have fled their mountainside villages to escape
attacks by rebels from the Allied Democratic Forces, whose
objectives are vague.
	   Some have returned home now that government soldiers are on
patrol. But many more would rather go hungry in town than return to
precarious lives on the mountainsides.
	   The road winds on for a few miles (kilometers) past Bundibugyo,
through several settlements and over the Congolese border. It ends
abruptly at a three-building trading post in the foothills.
	   The number of people on the road dwindles the farther you go
from town. Peasant farmers and hunters wave cheerfully at the rare
passing vehicle.
	   Women trudge by, loads of firewood tied to their backs by strips
of cloth wrapped across their foreheads.
	   Women and children gather at a stream where a bridge has
collapsed, to scrub clothes on worn rocks.
	   Shouts of recognition and enthusiastic handshakes greet a
soldier who had previously been posted at a nearby trading center.
Now, he's fighting the rebels who hide inside Congo.
	   There's not much to buy in Bundibugyo these days. Because of the
rebel menace, trade has waned, jobs are scarce and the poor have
become poorer. Many people walk barefoot down main street, their
Sunday clothes special only because they are clean.
	   ``Bundibugyo used to be a really cool place, really nice, but it
has been affected by the insurgency,'' said Lt. Col. Charles
Mukasa, a soldier stationed on the border.
	   Forty-eight kilometers (30 miles) to the east, a paved road
starts in Fort Portal and runs 74 kilometers (45 miles) south to
the regional capital, Kasese. Getting to Fort Portal is the hard
part.
	   It only has to drizzle in Bundibugyo, and the worn tires on old
cars cannot make the grade. What is only a 20-minute flight by army
helicopter from Bundibugyo to Kasese is a 4 1-2 -hour drive _ on a
near-dry day.
	   Outside Fort Portal, the Kachwamba technical college sits in
silent ruin since a rebel attack in June, when 80 students who
barricaded themselves in dormitories were burned alive. Rebels
abducted 74 others.
	   The foothills of the Rwenzori are dotted with small, mud houses
nestled in a tapestry of rice or corn fields and forests draped
over the rolling terrain.
	   Isolated from the rest of their own country and huddled in
protective cover from the rebels, Bundibugyo residents recently
enjoyed their first public celebration in three years.
	   On Ugandan independence day, they cheered a small parade and
laughed at a mock battle in which soldiers defeated rebels. Uganda
gained independence from Britain in 1962.
	   And when a government representative stood before them on the
grassy town plaza and promised a new road, they snickered. They'd
heard that before.

DiMaggio improves dramatically: `There's a little more hope'

<TEXT>
	   HOLLYWOOD, Florida (AP) _ American baseball great Joe DiMaggio
made a dramatic turnaround from a serious lung infection just after
doctors told his family and friends to prepare for the worst.
	   ``We called the family because, frankly, we thought we were
getting down to the last road,'' Dr. Earl Barron said Tuesday in an
interview with The Associated Press. ``Today, there's a little more
hope.''
	   DiMaggio, recovering from lung cancer surgery, fought off a
fever, pneumonia in his good lung and an intestinal infection that
developed during the weekend.
	   His condition was so grim at that time that doctors gathered
DiMaggio's family, including his brother, Dom, and even discussed
signing a ``do not resuscitate'' form for the 84-year-old Hall of
Famer.
	   ``We talked about that, but they did not feel comfortable with
that,'' Barron said.
	   The former New York Yankees center fielder has shown a
remarkable ability to fight back from several serious setbacks
since the cancerous tumor was removed from his right lung on Oct.
14.
	   ``He's going to be here a lot longer,'' Barron said.
	   But he also cautioned: ``Don't walk out of here and say 'Joe
DiMaggio's in great shape.' Everything is relative. You and I are
in good shape. He's hanging in there.''
	   His improvement began after doctors inserted a tube into
DiMaggio's trachea on Monday to suction the infected material.
	   ``He perked up immediately,'' Barron said.
	   Barron denied a broadcast report that DiMaggio had lapsed into a
coma.
	   ``His level of consciousness has been down because he was
sedated. But he is not in a coma. He is up and moving and opening
his eyes,'' he said.
	   DiMaggio entered Memorial Regional Hospital Oct. 12, with Barron
heading a team of six doctors treating him.
	   Since his surgery, he has suffered recurring pneumonia in his
left lung. Besides treatment with three antibiotics, he also has
had fluid drained from his lungs several times. His blood pressure
dropped so rapidly on Nov. 16 that a Catholic priest was summoned
to administer last rites.
	   The past weekend was particularly frightening.
	   ``I thought he was near death,'' said friend and attorney Morris
Engelberg. ``We're playing this day-by-day. Today is good.
Tomorrow, who knows?''
	   Even if DiMaggio is eventually discharged from the hospital, he
will never have the same quality of life, Engelberg said.
	   ``Machines are keeping him alive. He's been in the ICU for 58
days. He's got every hookup known to man. He's being fed through
tubes,'' Engelberg said. ``If he recovers, he won't be the same.
He'll never have the quality of life he did.''
	   Barron refused to speculate on whether DiMaggio would ever leave
the hospital. ``He could go sour in five minutes and he could walk
out of the hospital six weeks from now, I would certainly not want
to predict,'' he said.
	   Barron, who has treated DiMaggio for five years, is keenly aware
of why so many people admire his patient.
	   ``He's an icon. He's an amazing person. He's the greatest player
that ever played,'' Barron said, sitting in an office filled with
baseball, football, hockey and basketball memorabilia.

Number of Japan's wage earners may fall for first time since 1950s
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ For the first time in decades, Japan's work force
could shrink this year as companies restructure to adjust to the
country's economic downturn, the government said Wednesday.
	   The average monthly number of wage earners, excluding the self-
or family-employed, tumbled by 250,000 from January-October this
year, compared to the same period last year, said Ryo Ishibashi, a
spokesman for the Management and Coordination Agency.
	   ``We are not making projections, but there is a strong
possibility that the total for the year will be lower,'' Ishibashi
said.
	   Based on agency statistics, Japan's Nihon Keizai financial daily
estimated that the average number of wage earners through December
will total between 200,000 and 300,000 less than last year's 53.91
million.
	   Such a decline in the number of salaried workers would be the
first since the government started compiling employment statistics
in 1953.
	   The ranks of Japanese company workers have been steadily growing
since the end of World War II. But Japan's stubborn recession has
sent bankruptcies soaring and forced many companies to reduce their
work forces to survive.
	   In a separate example of worsening living conditions, Japan's
Government Housing Loan Corporation said Wednesday that the average
size of new homes receiving financing from the organization
declined during the last fiscal year.
	   In the year ended March 1998, the average floor space of homes
built nationwide with corporation loans fell 0.66 sq. meters (0.80
sq. yard) to 144.07 sq. meters (172.88 sq. yards) from fiscal 1996,
said corporation official Atsushi Tanaka.
	   The government-run corporation helps finance about 30 percent of
Japanese homes, Tanaka said.

Japanese stocks fall in morning trading, dollar lower against yen
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES thruout with midday trading &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Stock prices edged lower Wednesday morning after an
overnight drop on Wall Street. The U.S. dollar slipped against the
yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 35.32 points,
or 0.24 percent, to close the morning session at 14,772.88. On
Tuesday, the Nikkei gained 84.71 points, or 0.58 percent.
	   The dollar bought 119.18 yen, down 0.68 yen from late Tuesday in
Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 119.31 yen
overnight.
	   Japanese share prices were pushed lower by the overnight
weakness in U.S. stocks, traders said. In New York, the Dow Jones
industrial average ended at 9,027.98, down 42.49 points.
	   In Tokyo, many investors took to the sidelines ahead of the
settlement of December futures and options Friday.
	   Participants also turned cautious as they awaited the release
Monday of the Bank of Japan's closely-watched quarterly ``tankan''
business confidence survey.
	   But Parliament's swift approval of a 5.677 trillion yen (dlrs 48
billion) supplementary budget Tuesday evening cushioned the
market's fall, traders said.
	   The extra budget will help fund the 23.9 trillion yen (dlrs 20
billion) economic stimulus package that the government unveiled in
November.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
exchange's first section was down 0.39 points, or 0.03 percent, to
1,131.60. The TOPIX rose 6.99 points, or 0.62 percent, the previous
day.
	   On the foreign exchange market, dollar-buying sentiment was
dampened early in the morning by the weakness on Wall Street as
well as lingering worries over the outlook for the U.S. and Latin
American economies, traders said.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 1.150 percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.050 percent,
driving its price down to 105.97 yen from 106.47 yen.

UNICEF: recession may cause 5 million Thai children to drop out
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ More than 5 million Thai children could
be forced out of school for lack of money as the country's economic
crisis affects their families, the United Nations International
Children's Fund said on Wednesday.
	   ``We're asking the government to loosen up its education
policies so that these families with less money will be encouraged,
not discouraged from sending their children to school,'' said Fida
Shah, head of the UNICEF office in Bangkok.
	   Thailand is in the midst of its most severe economic crisis in
modern times.
	   Shah said that while the 5 million figure is a rough estimate,
families suffering hard times don't have money to pay tuitions, or
perhaps buy books, school uniforms or afford school lunches for
their children.
	   While only private schools charge tuitions, children in public
schools must buy their own books and uniforms. Many schools charge
fees for extracurricular activities or use of school computers in
the classrooms.
	   The fees are compulsory, and the government would be better off
relaxing such requirements in order to keep children in the
classroom, Shah said.
	   His statements coincided with the release of the U.N.'s State of
the World's Children 1999 report and the launch of a
UNICEF-sponsored program in Thailand to convince parents to keep
their children in school.
	   The report estimated that there will be 3 million Thais
unemployed in 1999, and even more earning less than minimum wage.
School enrollments at all levels are also down, the report said.
	   The UNICEF program is designed to inform parents of the
long-term benefits of keeping their children in school and letting
financially-troubled families know that there are government and
private-sector scholarships and financial aid available.
	   ``But you only learn about these opportunities if you are in the
school system, not outside it,'' Shah said.
	   Economists have criticized Thailand's education system as not
producing the kind of workers needed to handle higher technology
jobs, and therefore hindering the country's efforts to achieve
sustainable development.
	   They say the system is too centralized, not meeting the needs
and requirements of local communities, and relies too heavily on
rote learning which does not encourage creative or independent
thinking.

Soldini leads as solo sailors struggle with heavy winds
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SHEILA NORMAN-CULP &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Giovanni Soldini of Italy surged into the lead
of the second leg of the Around Alone solo race Tuesday as sailors
struggled to fix equipment broken in the fierce winds of the
southern Indian Ocean.
	   Thirteen racers left Cape Town, South Africa, for Auckland, New
Zealand, on Saturday in the second of the grueling four-part,
nine-month race. By Tuesday night, the leaders were 870 miles
(1,400 kilometers) to the southeast, averaging a roaring 220 miles
(350 kilometers) a day in their 40-to-60 (12-to-15-meter) foot
racing machines.
	   ``Hanging on for the ride. These are scary machines down here on
your own,'' Josh Hall of Britain reported.
	   Soldini passed Isabelle Autissier of France, who was having
problems with her swing keel, and built up an 11-mile
(18-kilometer) lead. Mike Golding of Britain and Marc Thiercelin of
France were 24 miles (38 kilometers) back, battling it out for
third and fourth place.
	   Mike Garside of Britain was leading in Class II, for boats up to
50 feet (15 meters), 66 miles (106 kilometers) ahead of Jean-Pierre
Mouligne of France. Viktor Yazykov of Russia was in third, 93 miles
(150 kilometers) back, followed by Brad Van Liew of Santa Monica,
California, 102 miles (163 kilometers) behind.
	   Two sailors left Cape Town on Tuesday: George Stricker of
Newport, Kentucky and Fedor Konioukhov of Russia. Stricker had
returned Monday for a lightning-quick pit stop to replace his
crumpled carbon-fiber boom with a new aluminum one, while
Konioukhov needed more time to finish repairs after his late finish
in the first leg.
	   That left only one sailor still in port, Robin Davie of
Charleston, South Carolina, who hoped to leave Wednesday after
installing a new autopilot and a heater for this icy,
7,000-mile-plus (11,200-kilometer-plus) leg.
	   Many racers were sailing with only their storm sails up after
running into a 50-mph (80 kmph) gale Monday. A low pressure system
was moving in, and forecasters were predicting up to 36 hours of
cold rain and strong winds _ typical weather for this wild section
of the world.
	   ``Getting underway was a bit hard, some bad memories are still
rattling around in my head,'' reported Autissier, who had to flee
her disabled boat on this leg in 1994, the last time the race was
held. ``But the next few days should erase all that, get me back in
the saddle.''

<TEXT>
	   TAMPA, Florida (AP) _ Shawn McEachern had two goals and an
assist Tuesday night to lead Ottawa to a 4-2 victory over Tampa
Bay.
	   Alexei Yashin added a goal and two assists. The center has eight
goals and 17 points in his past 14 games.
	   The Senators (13-8-3) outshot Tampa Bay 44-19 in going five
games over .500 for just the fourth time in team history. Ottawa is
11-3-3 in its last 17 road games, while the Lightning have lost 11
of 12, including six straight at home.
	   Benoit Hogue and Vincent Lecavalier had the Tampa Bay goals.
Hogue's first-period goal snapped a 27-game, goal-scoring drought.
 &UR; Red Wings 3, Blackhawks 2 &QC; 
	   In Detroit, two assists by Steve Yzerman led Detroit over
Chicago in a wide-open game. The loss snapped the Blackhawks'
three-game winning streak.
	   Nicklas Lidstrom, rookie Stacy Roest and Brendan Shanahan scored
for Detroit. Rookie Mike Maneluk and Eric Daze responded for
Chicago.
	   The game was just 27 seconds old when Lidstrom _ on a crisp pass
from Yzerman _ snapped a shot from the left circle past Chicago
goal Mark Fitzpatrick for his fourth goal.
	   Yzerman's second assist, on Shanahan's 14th goal, gave the Red
Wings a 3-1 lead.
 &UR; Avalanche 2, Islanders 1
	   In Uniondale, New York, Peter Forsberg scored the winning goal
while falling on his back and Patrick Roy stopped 31 shots in
Colorado's victory over the New York Islanders.
	   Forsberg's eighth goal of the season came at 5:51 of the third
period. Chasing after a loose puck with New York defenseman Rich
Pilon, both skaters were slowed by goalie Tommy Salo, who came out
of his net to play the puck. Salo missed the puck and Forsberg
managed to sweep a backhand into the vacated net as he was falling
down.
	   Cam Russell also scored for the Avalanche, which won their
fourth straight game and eighth straight over the Islanders.
Mariusz Czerkawski scored the lone goal for the Islanders, who have
lost six straight games and nine of their last 11.
 &UR; Flyers 5, Devils 5
	   In East Rutherford, New Jersey, Rod Brind'Amour scored the tying
goal with 3:45 remaining in the third period as Philadelphia tied
New Jersey.
	   The Brind'Amour goal capped a two-goal, third-period rally that
wiped out a 5-3 Devils lead. Eric Lindros scored his second
power-play goal of the game at 13:09 to set the stage for
Brind'Amour's tying tally.
	   Jody Hull and Danius Zubrus also scored for the Flyers, while
Bobby Holik, Jason Arnott, Dave Andreychuk, Patrik Elias and Brian
Rolston scored for New Jersey, which extended its unbeaten streak
to five (3-0-2). The Devils are also unbeaten in their last eight
games on home ice (5-0-3).

Central Asians dominate canoe races
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Uzbekistan won its first gold medal of
these Asian Games and Kazakstan raced off with three as Central
Asians dominated canoeing competition Wednesday.
	   China, Asia's major sports power, won just one of the day's five
races, run in early morning temperatures in the mid-20s Celsius
(mid-70s F). Bangkok's daytime temperatures ordinarily reach the
30s (90 F).
	   In the day's closest race, Kazakstan's Sergey Sergin took an
early lead but had to spurt over the last 250 meters to hold off
China's Jiang Yuguo by less than a second in the men's 1,000-meter
single kayaks.
	   Sergin won in 4 minutes, 1.76 seconds, with Jiang second in
4:02.71. Uzbekistan's Andrey Shilin, who had been within .3 second
of Sergin after 750 meters, faded at the end and took bronze in
4:05.00.
	   Kazakstan also won the two-man kayak and canoe races, both by
big margins.
	   Kayak racers Sergey Skrypnik and Yevgeniy Yegorov covered the
1,000 meters in 3:32.36. Uzbekistan's Anton Ryahov and Gerart
Shapar took silver in 3:37.56, and China's Fang Lei and Wang
Cuizhong were third in 3:41.15.
	   Canoeists K. Negodyayev and Sergey Sergeyev led China's Qiu
Suoren and Sun Maosheng by more than 11 seconds after 750 meters
and coasted to victory in 4:10.35. The Chinese won the silver in
4:21.29, and Japan's Fumiaki Okawa and Masanobu Ozono took the
bronze in 4:25.58.
	   Uzbekistan's four-man kayak team pulled ahead of Kazakstan's
quartet in the second 250 meters and widened their lead over the
final 250, winning in 3:10.44. Kazakstan took silver in 3:11.78 and
Indonesia was third in 3:14.64. Uzbekistan's winners were Rafael
Islamov, Andrery Shilin, Vladimir Kazantsev and Dmitriy Torlopov.
	   In the one-man canoe race, China's Meng Guanliang also made his
move after 250 meters and won in 4:36.06. Kazakstan's K.
Nurmaganbetov was second in 4:40.67 and South Korea's Lee Seung-woo
third in 4:52.74.
	   Seven more canoeing finals are scheduled Friday.

 &UR; AP Photo XBK101 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ India's athletic contingent, including
sprinter P.T. Usha, was held up for about three hours at Bangkok's
airport Tuesday night as exhausted Thai officials took time to
accredit them for the Asian Games.
	   An Air India plane carrying 32 Indian competitors and officials
landed at 11:40 p.m. from New Delhi Tuesday to take part in track
and field competition beginning Sunday.
	   After the formal welcome, the agonizing wait began.
	   Usha, 33, making her final appearance in an international meet,
sipped packet milk and waved a victory sign to a handful of
onlookers. In Bangkok, because of recent injuries, Usha may run
only in her favorite 400 meters.
	   Usha, the mother of 6-year-old son, is the only Indian who has
won an Asian Games gold in track and field since 1986.
	   No Indian has won a track and field medal in the Olympics, but
Usha came closest, missing bronze by 0.01 seconds in the 400-meter
hurdles at the 1984 games.
	   Thai officials said that it took more than the normal time to
accredit the Indians due to the late hour.
	   The contingent finally managed to leave the airport at around 3
a.m.

Foreign minister: Asians have misguided notion of Asian values
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Asian people have clung too long to a
misguided notion of Asian values in an attempt to justify
repression of democratic movements, Foreign Affairs Minister
Alexander Downer said Wednesday.
	   Speaking at a human rights conference in Sydney, Downer said
Asians have also used the same argument to prevent the evolution of
open civil societies.
	   ``It is only an open civil society which can be inclusive,
tolerant and truly outward looking,'' Downer said.
	   Downer did not make any reference in his speech to the treatment
of indigenous Australians. When asked what steps could be taken to
improve relations with Aborigines, he merely replied he was not the
minister for Aboriginal affairs.
	   ``In an international context Australia is recognized as a
country which has respect for human rights, both internationally
and domestically,'' he added.

Gulf nations call for halt to oil over-production
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS typo in overproduction in lead; INSERTS three grafs
after 4th graf, `GCC leaders...', to ADD background on Tuesday's
price swings. &QL; 
 &UR; By ANWAR FARUQI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ Gulf Arab countries,
grappling with ways to halt the plunge in oil prices that has
gouged their budgets, called on oil-rich nations to stop
overproduction.
	   ``The whole problem'' of low oil prices is caused by countries
not sticking to their production quotas, said Jamil al-Hojeilan,
secretary-general of the Gulf Cooperation Council.
	   ``We hope that pledges to abide by agreed-upon quotas are
respected,'' he told the Middle East Broadcasting Corp., an Arab TV
network on Tuesday.
	   GCC leaders were entering the third and final day Wednesday of a
summit in Abu Dhabi dominated by the issue of bolstering oil prices
that have plummeted because of the recession in Asia and
warmer-than-usual winters.
	   On Tuesday, crude and its byproducts retreated on the New York
Mercantile Exchange after a session filled with price swings.
	   Futures prices in London and New York jumped early on comments
from Crown Prince Abdullah bin Abdulaziz of Saudi Arabia, who
called for action to erase an oil glut and boost sagging prices.
They were further supported by an initial news report from The
Associated Press quoting unidentified officials from the GCC as
saying further production cuts had been approved.
	   Futures prices began to fall after al-Hojeilan denied plans for
a cut.
	   GCC member-states _ Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar
and the Emirates _ sit on half the world's proven oil reserves and
depend on exports for 75 percent of their revenues.
	   Analysts say the top overproducers on the world stage are
outside the regional council: Venezuela, Iran and Indonesia. Only
Qatar, another main quota-buster according to analysts, is present
at the Abu Dhabi summit.
	   The GCC meeting comes less than two weeks after ministers from
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) failed to
agree on measures to halt the slide in prices.
	   The 11-member cartel announced no new steps after its year-end
meeting in Vienna, saying only that they would review the situation
in March.
	   Shortly before the GCC meeting began, January futures contracts
for Brent crude _ a widely watched benchmark _ fell to a record low
of dlrs 9.92 a barrel in London. Brent was selling for around dlrs
20 a barrel as recently as 1997.
	   The Gulf producers have been grappling with widening budget
deficits and problems paying foreign debts. Saudi Arabia, for
example, had projected a dlrs 4.8 billion budget deficit for 1998,
but analysts predict it will reach dlrs 15 billion.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Crown Princess Masako celebrated her 35th birthday
Wednesday with hopes to secure new roles for herself and her
husband within Japan's imperial household, while preserving its
traditions.
	   ``I believe it is important to respect the traditions long
cultivated in the Imperial Family, as well as to introduce new
things,'' Masako said in a pre-birthday news conference at the
Imperial Palace on Friday.
	   A transcript of her comments was released to The Associated
Press on Wednesday.
	   The Princess said she wants to consult with her husband, Crown
Prince Naruhito, on ways to balance tradition with modernity.
	   Masako, a former diplomat and a Harvard University graduate,
said she has gained enough confidence to enjoy her imperial duties
since she joined the Imperial household in June 1993.
	   ``Thankfully, although at first I did not know my left from my
right, over time I have become used to the Palace functions and
official duties,'' she said.
	   Masako said that she and Naruhito have never had serious
quarrels in their five years of marriage, and gave credit to their
dogs Pippi and Mari for contributing to the harmony of their
marital life.
	   ``There is a Japanese saying that even a dog will not eat a
quarrel between man and wife,'' Masako said. ``But our dogs seem to
be rather good at picking up and swallowing all the seeds of our
quarrels.''
	   The princess said she and Naruhito are also looking after the
larvae from an injured stag beetle she found outside the palace
window last summer.
	   Masako said she has recently taken up the flute, and hopes
someday to join an ensemble with her husband and other members of
the Imperial Family.
	   The privacy of Japan's imperial family is strictly guarded, and
no foreign media were allowed into the princess' birthday press
conference.

Thais thin notorious Bangkok traffic for Asian Games
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Where are the notorious Bangkok traffic
jams that were going to ensnarl the Asian Games, enraging athletes
and stadium-bound fans?
	   While some roads are hardly traffic-free, no epic jams have been
reported thus far on the commutes among the widely scattered sports
venues.
	   Officials attribute this to an investment of more than 480
billion baht (dlrs 12 billion) in road projects, including the
construction of several expressways that opened just before the
start of the games.
	   Schools also have been closed for the Dec. 6-20 event, reducing
the number of buses and cars on the roads at peak hours.
	   ``Staging Asia's greatest games and smoothing Bangkok's traffic
are a matter of national pride as well as the duty of the entire
Thai populace,'' states a Games media release.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   HOPING FOR HEAT: While most athletes at the Asian Games pray for
cool weather, bowler Krijawat Jampakhao hopes for heat. And not too
much oil.
	   Thailand's gold medal hope says his chances for victory depend
on weather conditions and oiling of lanes at the bowling venue.
	   The oiling at the practice session favored keglers with a
spinning style, like those from bowling powerhouse Taiwan.
	   Hot weather, Krijawat explains, could dry the oil on the alley
quickly and change conditions to favor those like himself who like
to roll the type of curve ball that needs to grip the alley more.
	   The bad news: a cool front descended on the Thai capital
Wednesday.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   2006 BIDS: Malaysia, China, Qatar and Syria are bidding to stage
the 15th Asian Games in 2006, according to Olympic Council of Asia
President Sheik Ahmed Al-Sabah.
	   China already has been host once, in 1990, and tried
unsuccessfully to land the Olympics in 2000. It now has plans to
try for the 2008 Olympics.
	   The president also said Tuesday that the council was drawing up
measures and penalties to deal with countries that withdrew their
teams from competition.
	   Saudi Arabia pulled out of the current games at the last minute
but so far has not been penalized.
	   The 14th Asian Games will be held in Pusan, South Korea, in
2002.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   OZ ATTRACTIONS: Australia is taking advantage of the Asian Games
to promote the 2000 Olympics in Sydney.
	   An exhibition titled ``Australia-Our Sporting Life'' has opened
at one of the main sports complexes for the games. It provides a
taste of what Asians can look forward to at the next Olympics: the
Australian love of sport, state-of-the-art sports technology,
scenic settings and a friendly Aussie welcome.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ He was one of the most powerful men in
Asia until protesting students hounded him from office a little
over six months ago.
	   Now former President Suharto is at the center of a corruption
inquiry that goes to the heart of attempts to reform Indonesia as
it grapples with political turmoil, and ethnic and religious strife
fueled by the worst economic crisis in decades.
	   Its hands forced by a new wave of student protests, the
government has ordered a fresh investigation into Suharto's wealth.
	   State lawyers questioned him in a prosecutor's office in
downtown Jakarta on Wednesday, and officials warned he could be
placed under house arrest if he does not cooperate.
	   Still, many doubt the resolve of the government, dominated by
former Suharto supporters, to move against the old leader.
	   In recent weeks, students have stepped up protests after an
earlier government inquiry found no evidence against the
77-year-old Suharto.
	   Critics said that the probe by Attorney General Andi Mohammad
Ghalib was a whitewash. Now under pressure, Suharto's successor and
one-time protege, President B.J. Habibie, has ordered Ghalib to try
again.
	   It's doubtful the new inquiry will placate the students who have
accused Ghalib, a three-star army general, of going soft on
Suharto, himself a retired general.
	   Virtually every day hundreds, sometimes thousands, have
attempted to march on Suharto's heavily guarded home.
	   Always blocked by troops, some demand he be hanged. Most say he
should be sent to court and tried immediately, not just for graft
but for human rights abuses.
	   A security clampdown was enforced around central Jakarta as a
precaution against student demonstrations on Wednesday.
	   Suharto smiled and waved after pulling up in a Mercedes jeep at
the Jakarta High Attorney's office, which was heavily guarded by
riot police. Major streets were blocked, causing rush hour traffic
chaos.
	   Several small tanks were parked nearby, but there was no sign of
protesters who had expected Suharto to appear elsewhere at the
office of Attorney General Andi Mohammad Ghalib, who is conducting
the investigation.
	   The change of venue to the Jakarta prosecutors' office was
apparently a ruse designed to foil the students who show no sign of
easing their campaign for justice despite clashes before with the
military.
	   Nine students were shot and killed by security forces when they
tried to march on Parliament in November. Much of Jakarta was
wrecked or burned when riots broke out in May and claimed 1,200
lives, prompting Suharto to quit.
	   Suharto scoffs at accusations that he stashed billions of
dollars overseas and claims he has ``not one cent'' squirreled away
in foreign bank accounts.
	   He says he is worth about dlrs 3 million, far less than an
estimate earlier this year by Forbes magazine that put his wealth
at dlrs 4 billion. Others say it is even higher.
	   For weeks investigators have been compiling lists of assets
belonging to the Suharto clan, including hundreds of thousands of
acres of holdings across this sprawling Southeast Asian nation of
about 17,000 islands.
	   Suharto's six children are among Indonesia's wealthiest people
and head huge business empires that flourished under his patronage.
	   In the months since their father's downfall they have been the
target of separate corruption probes. Two of Suharto's sons have
been banned from leaving the country as investigators unravel their
business dealings.
	   Meanwhile companies controlled by their siblings have been
stripped of many lucrative government contracts and monopolies.
	   Habibie has promised to root out corruption and nepotism, which
	   international agencies like the World Bank say have worsened
Indonesia's economic woes.
	   But many critics say the government's links to the old leader
will prevent it from prosecuting him.
	   Even those in the ex-president's camp doubt the determination of
Habibie, a friend of Suharto for four decades and his Cabinet
minister for 20 years.
	   ``If Suharto does go to court, it could drag down the
government, bringing senior incumbent and former officials _ as
well as all the cronies suspected of accruing ill-gotten wealth _
into messy litigation,'' Suharto's legal advisor, Yohanes Yacob,
said last week.
	   The corruption allegations hang over Suharto at a dramatic time
for Indonesia, which was hit hard by Asia's financial meltdown.
	   A deep recession has entered its second year. Millions of people
have lost their jobs and have slipped into poverty. The annual
inflation rate is running at 80 percent. Crime is climbing.
	   Looting and riots break out sporadically, and relations between
the Muslim majority and the Christian minority, kept in check by
Suharto's iron-fisted policies, have deteriorated.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Under tight security, former President
Suharto on Wednesday fielded queries from government prosecutors
about allegations of corruption during his 32-year authoritarian
rule.
	   The 77-year-old ex-army general smiled and waved at staff
members after pulling up in a Mercedes jeep at the Jakarta High
Attorney's office, which was heavily guarded by riot police.
	   Several small tanks were parked nearby but there was no sign of
the student protesters who have been pressing for months for a
trial of Suharto on charges of corruption and human rights abuses.
	   Suharto arrived early in the morning and police closed major
roads in central Jakarta causing rush hour traffic chaos in the
already congested city of 11 million people. Security was also
stepped up around the presidential palace and other strategic
locations.
	   The state-run television network broadcast live reports from the
scene.
	   Office workers had to prove their identity to troops before
being allowed to pass checkpoints. Some were ferried to their
offices by army trucks. Others were angered when they were stopped.
	   The students helped force him out of power in May amid political
turmoil and hardship caused by the worst economic crisis in decades
in the Southeast Asian nation of 202 million people.
	   Suharto had been expected to appear at the office of Attorney
General Andi Mohammad Ghalib, who is conducting an investigation of
his wealth, estimated by Forbes magazine at dlrs 4 billion.
	   The change of venue to the Jakarta prosecutors' office was
apparently a ruse designed to foil students who have frequently
staged protests at Ghalib's office and occupied it for one day last
month.
	   About 300 people had gathered at Ghalib's office on Wednesday.
Many said they were disappointed not to have seen the former
autocrat. Some shouted anti-Suharto slogans and held up protest
banners.
	   Suharto, now a virtual recluse in his Jakarta home, was
accompanied to the prosecutor's office by several men, including
his lawyer. The former president wore traditional Indonesian
clothing that he often appeared in while in office: a batik shirt
and a black cap.
	   A spokesman for the attorney general said Suharto was being
questioned over his patronage of a number of charitable foundations
that prosecutors allege were actually being run as businesses with
government support and tax relief.
	   Last month Suharto handed over control of seven foundations,
worth dlrs 530 million, to the government.
	   The spokesman said the old leader was being asked about his role
in a so-called ``national car'' project, through which Suharto's
son, Hutomo ``Tommy'' Mandala Putra, was licensed to import cars
from Korea's Kia Motors Corp. without having to pay billions of
dollars in import tariffs like other car companies.
	   Critics claimed the project contravened basic international
trade rules.
	   In recent weeks, students have stepped up protests after an
earlier government inquiry of Suharto found no evidence of
wrongdoing.
	   Critics said that probe by Ghalib was a whitewash. Now under
pressure, Suharto's successor and one-time protege, President B.J.
Habibie, has ordered Ghalib to try again.
	   Suharto scoffs at accusations that he stashed billions of
dollars overseas and claims he has ``not one cent'' squirreled away
in foreign bank accounts.
	   Also Wednesday, Mohamad ``Bob'' Hasan, a former trade and
industry minister, appeared at the attorney general's office for
questioning about corruption allegations.
	   Hasan, a one-time golfing buddy of Suharto, is a business tycoon
with big interests in the timber industry.
	   Ghalib's spokesman said Hasan would be quizzed over allegations
that one of his companies illegally received money from a Suharto
foundation.
	   Troops and armored vehicles were also protected Habibie's
residence.
	   Student leaders and pro-democracy activists said they planned to
stage a series of protests in the city later in the day.

Woods against Norman: it's up to the captains

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ It's a golf fan's dream _ Tiger
Woods in a head-to-head shootout with Greg Norman to decide the
Presidents Cup.
	   Woods, the world No. 1, versus the man whose crown he took;
Woods, who has yet to prove himself in a team event, against
Norman, the local hero on the comeback trail from injury.
	   And Woods, the youngest player in the Presidents Cup
competition, versus the oldest. A battle between the two most
recognizable and popular players in the game.
	   U.S. team captain Jack Nicklaus and International captain Peter
Thomson won't announce pairings for the final-day singles matches
on Sunday for another three days, after play finishes Saturday.
	   But already interest is running high at the prospect of two of
golf's biggest stars facing off for the first time in a
professional tournament.
	   ``I would love the experience,'' Woods said of the possibility.
``He and I have never actually been paired together in a PGA Tour
event or any event, so I would love to have that chance.''
	   ``It would be exciting because if you look at my history as a
professional I have never really played Greg head-to-head.''
	   But competition would be no less fierce if he plays against
someone else.
	   ``If I play Nick Price or Greg Norman or Steve Elkington or
Ernie Els or whomever I am out to win a point for my country.''
	   Norman recalled only two occasions when he had played with
Woods. They played nine holes once in Florida when Woods was 15,
and had a practice round
	   ``somewhere in the last year or two.''
	   ``If it happens, I think that would be great,'' Norman said
Wednesday. ``I would be looking just as much forward to it if it
happens, as what he would be looking forward to it.''
	   Norman, 43, is back after an eight-month layoff following
shoulder surgery in April. In his first tournament since, he
finished a disappointing 36th at last week's Australian Open with
an overall score of 299, including a 10-over par 82 in the second
round.
	   Woods lost in a playoff last week to Price in the Sun City
Challenge in South Africa.

NBA cancels All-Star game; will season be next?
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The All-Star game is the latest casualty of the
National Basketball Association lockout. The only thing left to
save is the season itself.
	   Ending a 47-year-old tradition of bringing its top talent
together for a special showcase, the NBA on Tuesday canceled the
All-Star game, which had been set for Feb. 14 in Philadelphia.
	   ``This is just a result of the inexorable march of the
calendar,'' commissioner David Stern said. ``There just isn't
enough time left to have a season with an All-Star game.
	   ``We apologize to the city of Philadelphia, but we promise to
bring the All-Star Weekend back as soon as possible.''
	   Stern called Mayor Edward Rendell to break the news, but it
really didn't come as a surprise. With collective bargaining
negotiations at a standstill and the outlook increasingly bleak,
the biggest question now is whether there will be a season at all.
	   ``If we can't make this deal, I don't think there's hope for the
sport itself,'' Stern said in one of his most pessimistic comments
to date.
	   The cancellation meant Philadelphia would lose an estimated dlrs
35 million in business associated with the game.
	   The NBA had held an All-Star game every year without fail since
1951, and this season's version would have given the 76ers a chance
to show off their new arena, the First Union Center, and perhaps
even their best player, Allen Iverson, if he had made the Eastern
Conference team.
	   It also would have given NBC a chance to draw one of its largest
audiences of the winter during the all-important February sweeps
period.
	   Last season, NBC drew its highest rating of the regular season,
a 10.6, for the All-Star game from Madison Square Garden.
	   The owners and players have not met for negotiations since last
Thursday, and no new talks are scheduled.
	   Stern has refused to set a date when it would be too late to
save the season, saying it will expire of its own accord in the not
too distant future. He also ruled out having an All-Star game at
the conclusion of the season.
	   The first two months of the season have already been scrapped,
and it now cannot begin until mid-January at the earliest.
	   Deputy commissioner Russ Granik disclosed that the league is
willing to extend the playoffs until the end of June _ about 10
days later than usual _ but would not be willing to play into July.
	   If a season can be salvaged, it appears it will contain less
than 50 games. Stern reiterated Tuesday that having a handshake
deal on a new collective bargaining agreement won't be enough for
him to lift the lockout. The deal will first have to be put to
paper and ratified, a process that could take about two weeks.

Lightning hits Japan domestic flight, nose cone damaged
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ An Air Nippon domestic flight carrying 50 people
had its nose cone dented Wednesday after being struck by lightning
while preparing to land at an airport in western Japan, the airline
said.
	   None of the 44 passengers and 6 crew aboard the Airbus 320 was
injured, said Hideki Morikawa, a spokesman for Air Nippon _ a
subsidiary of Japan's second-largest carrier All Nippon Airways.
	   Despite the minor damage, the plane landed safely and on time,
Morikawa said.
	   He denied a Kyodo News report that the lightning created a hole
in the nose cone.
	   The plane was to be repaired at the airport in Yonago, 640
kilometers (400 miles) west of Tokyo. The return flight to Tokyo
was canceled.

Pinochet decision &QL;

	   LONDON (AP) _ As emotionally charged lobbying continues over the
fate of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, human rights lawyers have begun
preparing legal moves to prevent the former Chilean dictator from
immediately fleeing Britain should Home Secretary Jack Straw rule
against extradition.
	   Meanwhile, the general's lawyers are pursuing links between a
leading human rights group and the senior judge who ruled that
Pinochet's arrest on charges of genocide and torture could stand.
	   A five-member panel in the House of Lords, Britain's highest
court, ruled 3-2 on Nov. 25 that Pinochet did not have immunity as
a former foreign head of state, paving the way for Spain's
extradition request to continue.
	   Spain is seeking the general's extradition for killings and
torture by his security forces during his 17-year-regime. Pinochet,
not seen in public since his Oct. 16 arrest in a London hospital,
remains under police guard in a rented mansion at Wentworth, 20
miles (30 kms) west of London.
	   Straw must decide by Friday whether extradition proceedings can
go ahead. Whatever his decision, lawyers on both sides are on alert
to file a legal challenge.
	   The Times reported Wednesday that the law firm Bindmans, which
represents Amnesty International and other human rights groups, had
asked Straw for advance notice of his decision. But Straw sent a
letter saying that he would ``inform all parties of his decision
... at the same time.''
	   A Home Office spokeswoman, speaking on customary anonymity,
denied that report early Wednesday, saying that Straw has not yet
said anything about when his decision would come _ or how he will
notify interested groups.
	   ``Common sense and natural justice demand that any challenge to
the home secretary's decision should be allowed to take place while
General Pinochet remains in this country,'' lawyer Geoffrey Bindman
was quoted as telling The Times.
	   Meanwhile, lawyers for Pinochet may ask the House of Lords to
reconsider its decision because of Lord Justice Leonard Hoffmann's
connections to Amnesty International, British newspapers reported
Wednesday.
	   Amnesty International acknowledged Tuesday that Hoffmann, 64, an
opponent of apartheid who settled in Britain in the '60s, has
served since 1990 as director and chairman of Amnesty International
Charity Ltd. His wife, Gillian, is a secretary in Amnesty
International's press office in London.
	   Hoffmann cast one of the three deciding votes against Pinochet.
But Amnesty International insists neither he nor his wife were
involved in its long campaign to have Pinochet tried in court.
	   As lawyers considered their legal positions, emotions continued
to rise around the case. Widows of Chilean policemen killed by
``Marxist terrorists'' chanted in London for the 83-year-old
general's release. Human rights groups took out full page
advertisements in British newspapers, listing the names of victims
of Pinochet's regime and asking Straw to send the extradition
request forward.
	   A Chilean government report says 3,197 people were murdered or
disappeared at the hands of the secret police after Pinochet
overthrew Salvador Allende, an elected Marxist, in 1973.

Controversial taekwondo ruling raises judging complaints
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Taekwondo competitors and coaches have
disparaged the judging procedures used at the Asian Games after one
woman's initial victory was overruled and reversed.
	   China's middleweight He Luming was initially awarded the gold
medal Monday over South Korean Lee Hee-Young, but the decision was
reversed on a protest.
	   The case spotlighted dissatisfaction with judging techniques and
what some said was a threat of bias due to the large number of
South Korean judges. Taekwondo is a South Korean national sport.
	   Sung Sun-Tung, a coach for Taiwan's team, noted that the Asian
Games matches are scored by hand, with the four judges recording
marks on paper.
	   ``If it isn't electronically scored, we can't see the results
until the end of the round _ this isn't right at all,'' Sung said
Tuesday.
	   Though it debuted at Seoul in 1988 as a demonstration sport,
taekwondo officially becomes an Olympic sport in 2000. By then,
Sung hopes a different scoring method will be used.
	   ``We are all very excited at the prospect of being able to
compete in the Olympics,'' Sung said. ``We want to win gold there,
but first the referees must be fair.''
