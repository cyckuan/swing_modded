<TEXT>
<P>
The normalization with Egypt, an active supporter of the
anti-Iraq coalition during the Gulf crisis, was symbolized by the
visit of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to Jordan last January.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Jordan improved its ties with the
Palestinians by dispelling their fears that arouse among the
Palestinians due to Jordan's special role in Jerusalem under the
Jordanian-Israeli accord.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Jordan also made efforts to push forward the
Palestinian-Israeli negotiations on expanding Palestinian autonomy
in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
To its own benefits, Jordan's peace treaty with Israel and new
attitude toward Baghdad have also brought about warmer ties with
the Western countries, with the United States in particular.
</P>
<P>
Among others, U.S. Vice President Al Gore, British Prime
Minister John Major, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Japanese Prime
Minister Tomiichi Murayama as well as Spanish Prime Minister
Felipe Gonzalez, visited Amman and reiterated their countries'
support for the kingdom in various fields.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher came to Jordan time
and again to meet with King Hussein during his more than a dozen
of shuttle visits to the region to expedite the ongoing Middle
East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton Administration also voiced its full support, without
reservation, to the kingdom to defend its security immediately
after Iraqi former Industry Minister Kamel Hassan defected to
Jordan in August, warning against a threat of Iraqi retaliation
upon Jordan.
</P>
<P>
In the past year, King Hussein, Crown Prince Hassan and Prime
Minister Sharif Zeid Ben Shaker as well as other senior Jordanian
officials traveled to London, Paris, Tokyo, Bonn and Washington,
bringing home agreements for economic aid or military assistance
as well as promises of support.
</P>
<P>
Its success of hosting the second Middle East and North Africa
economic summit in Amman, which drew the participation of 1,600
government officials and private businessmen from 62 countries
across the world, added great credit to the kingdom and was considered
the crowning accomplishment of Jordan's foreign policy.

<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Jordan, in the past year,
witnessed a series of remarkable achievements on its diplomatic
front.
</P>
<P>
In the year, the kingdom restored its territorial and water
rights from Israel, normalized relations with the Jewish state,
improved ties with other Arab states and moved closer to the
Western countries, especially the United States.
</P>
<P>
The historic Israel-Jordan peace treaty signed in October,
1994, which ended 46 years of enmity between them, heralded a new
era for Jordan's foreign policy and was consequently lauded as a
model of peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Jordan regained sovereignty over its territories
occupied by Israel and exchanged ambassadors with Tel Aviv. It
also signed a number of agreements with Israel, expanding peace to
economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Its grant of political asylum to General Hussein Kamel Hassan,
son-in-law of President Saddam Hussein, and its growing
estrangement from Iraq, have quickened the pace to improve its
relations with the Gulf Arab states, which were strained because
of Jordan's tilt toward Iraq during the 1990-1991 Gulf crisis.
</P>
<P>
In the past year, the kingdom also saw an outstanding warm-up
of ties with Saudi Arabia, the strongest of the six-nation Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC).
</P>
<P>
Jordan's Foreign Minister Abdul-Karim Kabariti visited Riyadh
twice during the year and was received by Saudi King Fahd on his
second visit to the oil-rich Gulf kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Ambassador to Jordan Abdullah Sudairi arrived in Amman
last month and took his post five years after Saudi Arabia
recalled its ambassador in Amman, marking the return to normal of
the bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
A visit to Saudi Arabia by King Hussein and his summit meeting
with King Fahd, which had been scheduled for early this month but
were canceled due to Fahd's sudden illness, are expected to
materialize soon.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait, invaded by Iraq in 1990, has not formally announced its
normalization with Jordan, but has been moving closer to it.
</P>
<P>
The two countries' foreign ministers met repeatedly on the
sidelines of many regional and international gatherings and
agreed to conducting regular coordination and consultation.

<HEADLINE> Series of Militant Attacks Occur in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Violence seems on the rise in
Egypt as a latest sign that militant attacks may be intensified in
the most populous Arab country.
</P>
<P>
The latest violence took place today in southern Egypt where
three policemen were slightly injured by unidentified gunmen in
southern Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The official Middle East News Agency (MENA) quoted a security
source as saying that the gunmen opened fire at a police car,
which was passing near plantations close to the al-Rodah village
in Malawi, Minya, 260 kilometers south of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
The car, carrying license plates of the New Valley Security
Directorate, was on its way to Cairo when being attacked,
according to MENA. The security forces launched an operation
trying to arrest the gunmen.
</P>
<P>
It was on the second consecutive day that such a militant
attack took place in Minya.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, unidentified assailants killed two policemen and one
civilian as they opened fire at a traffic police patrol car on a
road west of Abu Korkas in the governorate of Minya.
</P>
<P>
Four other policemen and as many civilians, including a young
girl, were injured during the attack.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, three gunmen killed one person and injured
another in Abu Korkas.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has been haunted by terrorist attacks, especially in the
south, since 1992. Most of these attacks were believed to have
been carried out by Islamic militants who seek to topple
toppling the secular government and replacing it with a strict
Islamic rule.

<HEADLINE> Yearender: Tanzania Sees Peaceful Transition To Multi-Partyism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has accomplished
a peaceful transition to a multy-party system this year after
Benjamin Mkapa was sworn in as President of the United Republic
of Tanzania in late November.
</P>
<P>
The country's recent presidential and parliamental elections
went on smoothly against the predictions of some analysts, and
turned out to be a great success at every stage from registration
to ballot casting.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania began preparations for the transition five years ago.
</P>
<P>
In order to ensure continued stability, which had featured the
situation in Tanzania for more than 30 years, the country's then
ruling Revolutionary Party (CCM) decided to start the process on
its own initiative.
</P>
<P>
Mwalimu Julius Nyerere, the founder of the party and the
Republic, at that time urged CCM to take the initiative in a
change, saying CCM should seek self-improvement with the help of
the opposition.
</P>
<P>
A national debate was held in February 1990 on a multi-party
system in the country. And afterwards in April 1991, the then
President Ali Hassan Mwinyi appointed a presidential commission,
which invited Tanzanians to air opinions on a feasible political
pattern for the country.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that 80 percent of the 40,000 interviewees
said they did not want many parties, the National Executive
Committee (NEC) of the ruling CCM recommended a multi-party
system.
</P>
<P>
"If the majority of you are for CCM, then there is no worry
about CCM winning," and "you have to accept on behalf of the
people rather than the CCM," the ruling party's officials argued
in their various reports.
</P>
<P>
The NEC's proposal for a new, multi-party system in the
country was adopted at CCM's extraordinary national congress in
February, 1992.
</P>
<P>
Then CCM adopted amendments to the party constitution. The
National Assembly or parliament followed suit, making
corresponding changes in the constitution.
</P>
<P>
A law was enacted on political parties in the country with a
new electoral law taking effect later to pave the way for the
inauguration of a multi-party system in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Retired president Nyerere is the very statesman who proved to
be the mastermind of the peaceful transition and has been
commended for his outstanding role in maintaining the country's
national unity and stability.
</P>
<P>
After independence in the 1960s, Nyerere led the country in a
struggle to safeguard the national interests and create a society
of equality, freedom, fraternity and dignity.
</P>
<P>
The former Tanzanian leader, though retired, has been advising
the country on such important issues as standards of qualified
would-be president since 1985.
</P>
<P>
Local reports considered Nyerere's biggest success to be "the
construction of a nation with a culture of unity and harmony."

<HEADLINE> Year of Vacationing Opens in South China City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANYA, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese vice-premier and Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen announced the opening of the year of
vacationing and leisure today in this tourist city of Hainan
Province in south China.
</P>
<P>
The high-toned publicity of the event is another effort by the
Chinese tourism authority to sweeten its attractions to overseas
tourists, after the year of natural scenery in 1993, the year of
cultural relics in 1994 and the year of folk and customs in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Also present at the opening ceremony are Hainan Province
governor Ruan Chongwu, director of the National Tourism
Administration He Guangwei, and secretary general of the World
Tourism Organization Geohrey H. Lipman.
</P>
<P>
Mr. He Guangwei estimated that China has received eight million
overseas tourists and earned eight billion U.S. dollars from that
in 1995. Incomes from domestic tourists also hit a record
110-billion yuan in that year.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the coming year of vacationing and leisure
will probably raise the incomes from overseas tourists to nine
billion U.S. dollars, and that from domestic tourists to some 125
billion yuan in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Lipman predicted in his speech that in the next 10 years,
tourism-related investment to China will increase by four times to
reach 80 billion U.S. dollars. The value of GDP created by tourism
will increase by five folds to hit 200 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Lipman also commented that there is no better place than
Hannan to launch the year of vacationing and leisure. He said that
the World Tourism Organization will co-operate with China to
improve the nation's tourism facilities and market promotions.
</P>
<P>
Governor Ruan Chongwu said that as a rising tropical
attraction, Hainan has received 3.25 million tourists in the past
year, which is 12 percent up from that of 1994.
</P>
<P>
As a major destination for the year of vacationing and leisure,
Hainan will host a series of activities, including the 1996 Hainan
International Exhibition of Tourist Clothes, the Sanya
International Bicycle Race and the Fifth Hainan International
Coconut Festival.

<HEADLINE> King Hussein to Visit Israel Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 1 (Xinhua) -- King Hussein of Jordan will
arrive in Tel Aviv next Wednesday to pay his first official visit
to Israel since the two countries signed a peace treaty last year.
</P>
<P>
According to Israel Radio, King Hussein is scheduled to
inaugurate an emergency unit, named after late Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin, in the Ihilov Hospital in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Tel Aviv, the king will also stop at the
square where Rabin was assassinated on November 4 by Yigal Amir, a
Jewish right-wing extremist.
</P>
<P>
He will later be flied by helicopter to Bet Gabriel on the Sea
of Galilee to attend a ceremony honoring Israeli and Jordanian
peace negotiators who helped to work out the peace agreement
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Israel and Jordan signed the peace treaty on October 1994,
marking the end of 46 years of state of war and the start of the
process of normalization between the countries.
</P>
<P>
Following the signing of the peace treaty, the two countries
established diplomatic relations and exchanged ambassadors.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that King Hussein had paid several secret
visits to Israel and held talks with Israeli leader even before
the two countries signed the peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
On November 6, among other world leaders, the Jordanian
king unofficially visited Jerusalem to participate in Rabin's
funeral.

<HEADLINE> Yearender: Liberian Peace In Sight, But Hard Part Just Begins (Part Three) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 1 (Xinhua) -- "The Liberian peace is in
sight, at last!" Abacha made the indication after his July talks
with Charles Taylor. One month later, came the Abuja Peace
Accord.
</P>
<P>
Since the signing of the accord in August, a pile of reports,
both jubilant and disturbing, have been emanating from Monrovia,
the capital of Liberia:
</P>
<P>
In mid-November, several major roads leading to Monrovia,
which had long been "sealed" by warring factions, were opened
to traffic for the first time in the last three years.
</P>
<P>
On December 7, a relief convoy of 15 vehicles carrying food,
drugs and other supplies left Monrovia and arrived safely at Lofa
County, an isolated region in northwestern Liberia.
</P>
<P>
On December 18, three batches of ECOWAS peacekeepers arrived
at Gbarnga, Voinjama and Greenville, the headquarters of Taylor,
Kromah and Boley respectively, to disarm the three major warring
factions of NPFL, ULIMO-K and LPC.
</P>
<P>
And, on December 24, exactly six years after the outbreak of
the Liberian civil war, several thousand refugees returned to
Monrovia from abroad for the first time to spend the Christmas.
</P>
<P>
"Occasionally, reports of sporadic fighting could also be
heard. But ceasefire was generally observed," said Xavier
Emmanuelli, a French minister, who just ended his three-day
visit to Monrovia in mid-December.
</P>
<P>
However, a disturbing report from Monrovia on December 20 rang
a warning bell that Liberia's peace prospects were still fragile
following the sacking of two ministers by the four-month-old
Council of State in mid-December.
</P>
<P>
Tom Woewiyou, NPFL Labor Minister who had led a coup against
Charles Taylor, and Roosevelt Johnson, Rural Development Minister
who had been leader of the ULIMO-J, were both accused of "making
statements incompatible with decorum and officialdom."
</P>
<P>
Military observers said both ministers still commanded hostile
factions which could jeopardise the four-month-old Abuja Peace
Agreement.
</P>
<P>
And Charles Taylor threatened: "People must understand we
still have the guns and if anyone thinks he can make reckless
statements and hide under the ECOMOG, he is living in a fool's
paradise and would face the jungle justice."
</P>
<P>
"This development is only the tip of the iceberg," warned a
foreign diplomat. "Potential threats to peace are always there."
</P>
<P>
The disarmament process has just begun. But up to date about
60,000 soldiers of various former warring factions have still
been armed with all sorts of weapons.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of refugees went back home recently. But there are
still 800,000 Liberian refugees scattered around West Africa.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank, the African Development Bank and other
financial institutions have promised to aid the war-torn country
on its way to peace. But their services remain almost on
the lips.
</P>
<P>
Yes, peace is in sight in Africa's old independent nation as
the year 1996 comes. But this is only the beginning of a new
process. Just as Ghanaian President Jerry Rawlings has put it:
"The hard part has just begun."

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 1 (Xinhua) -- In 1995, the strength of the
once biggest warring faction,the National Patriotic Front of
Liberia (NPFL) led by Charles Taylor, was seriously weakened
following numerous internal strifes and a series of military
defeats.
</P>
<P>
A similar split of power occurred within NPFL's major rival,
the United Liberation Movement (ULIMO), when it was broken into
two smaller factions: one headed by Alhaji Kromah (ULIMO-K), the
other under the leadership of Roosevelt Johnson (ULIMO-J).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, four other minor factions formed a coalition, led
by George Boley's Liberia Peace Council (LPC), to gain power in
Liberia's political life.
</P>
<P>
Hence the status quo: none of the three big factions --
Taylor's NPFL, Kromah's ULIMO-K and George Boley's LPC, could
boast of an overwhelming force to conquer the other two.
</P>
<P>
"A situation of tripartite balance of power has finally come
into being, which naturally formed the basis of the Abuja Peace
Accord," said a political analyst.
</P>
<P>
On September 1, a six-member Council of State, comprising
leaders of the three big warring factions, Charles Taylor, Alhaji
Kromah and George Boley, was sworn in.
</P>
<P>
It was also joined by three civilian members: Oscar Quiah,
representative of the citizens of Monrovia; Tamba Taylor, one of
Liberia's traditional leaders who was a "paramount chief"; and
Wilton Sankawolo, a professor from the University of Liberia who
was appointed chairman of the council.
</P>
<P>
And, the transitional role played by Sankawolo was widely
accepted by the warring factions since the council chairman would
not be allowed to run for the 1996 general elections.
</P>
<P>
"This even allocation of power in the interim government (the
Council of State) created a chance that might finally lead to the
successful general elections in the country next year," said
Mahamadou Ouhoumoudou, Deputy Executive Secretary of ECOWAS.
</P>
<P>
Salim Ahmed Salim, Secretary-General of the Organisation
of African Unity (OAU), said the conclusion of the Abuja Peace
Accord was "the victory of the ECOWAS peacekeeping mechanism and an
example for Africa as a whole to prevent, control and solve its
regional conflicts."
</P>
<P>
Over 8,500 soldiers of the ECOWAS peacekeeping force, known as
ECOMOG, have been operative in Liberia since August 1990. They
would remain there until September 30, 1996, when an elected
government is sworn into office.
</P>
<P>
The nation had long been a focus of attention at the last six
ECOWAS head-of-state summit meetings.
</P>
<P>
Both Nigerian Head of State General Sani Abacha and Ghanaian
President Jerry Rawlings have been deeply involved in the
mediation efforts this year.
</P>
<P>
Abacha held two secret talks with his long-time enemy Charles
Taylor in Abuja, in May and July separately, to discuss the
Liberian peace process. The developments were described by a
Liberian diplomat as "historical".

LAGOS, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Massacre stopped.
Coalition government formed. And preparations for elections
started. The year 1995 witnessed a breakthrough in Liberia's
drawn-out request for a return to peace.
</P>
<P>
However, in the West African country torn apart by six years
of civil war, the way toward a lasting peace is bound to be tough
and thorny with 800,000 refugees to be repatriated and 60,000
soldiers to be disarmed.
</P>
<P>
The flames of war were kindled on the Christmas eve, 1989, by
former cabinet minister Charles Taylor to topple the late President
Samuel Doe.
</P>
<P>
Doe's death in 1990 did not bring an end to the war, which
later escalated to an ethnic slaughter between the Gios and Manos
who backed Charles Taylor and the Khrans who were still faithful
to Doe, among others.
</P>
<P>
So far, the war had claimed 150,000 lives and displaced over
half of Liberia's population of 2.8 million.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, efforts of negotiation, mediation, peacekeeping and
peacemaking have never ceased, resulting in the signing and
breach of a dozen ceasefire agreements.
</P>
<P>
These "dead letters" included: the Lome Peace Accord of 1991,
the Geneva Accord of 1992, the Cotonou Accord of 1993, the
Akosombo Agreement and the Accra Clarification of 1994, just to
name a few.
</P>
<P>
The year 1995 opened with a new round of mediations conducted
by the 16-member Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS).
</P>
<P>
The January talks in Accra, capital of Ghana, ended in vain.
Fruits were indeed born out of the May meeting in Abuja, capital
of Nigeria, but the pick of a 90-year-old civilian to chair the
interim cabinet once again got vetoed by the warlord Charles
Taylor.
</P>
<P>
A turn of fortune occurred on August 20, when Liberia's
warlords signed a comprehensive peace accord in Abuja, with the
mediation of ECOWAS.
</P>
<P>
Ceasefire was effected a week later and the post-war general
elections was scheduled for August 20, 1996, under the
supervision of the observers from the United Nations and ECOWAS.
</P>
<P>
"The Abuja Peace Accord, signed at a time of long-standing
stalemate of war, differs with all the dead agreements signed
before," Edouard Benjamin, Executive Secretary of ECOWAS, noted.

<P>
MAPUTO, January 1 (Xinhua) -- The fight against hunger will
top the Mozambican government's agenda and pose a major challenge
to the Mozambican people in 1996, President Joaquim Chissano has
said.
</P>
<P>
In a New Year's message to the nation last night, Chissano
said against the backdrop of worsening famine, the Mozambican
government will take effective measures in 1996 to increase grain
yield and the production of daily necessities.
</P>
<P>
In the past year, the president said, the Mozambican people
have made unremitting efforts to safeguard peace and stability,
achieve national reconciliation and accelerate national
reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
On international issues, he said Mozambique will continue to
strive for increased cooperation with other countries so that

<HEADLINE> Liberian Journalists and Government at Loggerheads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 1 (Xinhua) -- A rift is developing between
liberia's Ministry of Information and the Press Union of Liberia
(pul) over who should accredit journalists in the country, the
Pan African News Agency (PANA) reported from Monrovia today.
</P>
<P>
The rift started Wednesday when Information Minister Victoria
Reffell and a union nominee in the Liberian national transitional
government announced that only the ministry will accredit
journalists in the country.
</P>
<P>
She then gave 10 days for journalists to register with the
ministry or risk being barred from covering public functions.
</P>
<P>
Pul on the same day issued a statement describing the action
as press censorship and a contravention of a memorandum of
umderstanding signed by the ministry and the Press Union in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference hosted by counciller Charles
Taylor in the Liberian capital Thursday, Reffell said the
ministry's decision was irrevocable, which prompted the Press
Union to convene an emergency meeting.
</P>
<P>
It was at the meeting attended by both the public and private
media that the decision to boycott the coverage of government
activities was made should the Information Ministry carry out its
threat.
</P>
<P>
The Press Union said, however that allowing the decision to go
uncontested would allow a loss in current efforts to create a
free press in Liberia.
</P>
<P>
Observers saw the ministry's move as an attempt to create
growing control over sensitive institutions in Liberia.

<HEADLINE> Ghali to Meet AL Chief in Cairo </HEADLINE>

<P>
CAIRO, January 1 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali, currently on a visit to Egypt, will hold talks with
Arab League (AL) Secretary General Esmat Abdul-Meguid here Tuesday
mainly on the Yemeni-Eritrean dispute over the Red Sea island of
Greater Hanish.
</P>
<P>
Ghali, who arrived in Cairo Sunday night, had visited both
Yemen and Eritrea in a bid to solve their dispute, which flared up
last month when the Eritrean troops captured the island and the two
sides fought a fierce battle.
</P>
<P>
Ghali and Meguid will review the latest developments of the
situation in the island, which has been claimed by both Yemen and
Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian and Ethiopian leaders as well as Ghali have been
mediating between the two sides, both of which expressed
willingness to resolve the crisis through peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
At their meeting, Ghali and Meguid will also discuss
means of easing the U.N. sanctions on Iraq and the situation in
Somalia, according to Egypt's Middle East News Agency (MENA).
</P>
<P>
Ways to promote cooperation between the AL and the
U.N. will also be dealt with during the meeting, MENA said.

<HEADLINE> Saudi King Hands over Government Affairs to Crown Prince </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Saudi King Fahd today issued a
decree on handing over the government power to Crown Prince
Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here, the king said in the decree
that he needed to rest, but he did not say how much time he needed
to recuperate.
</P>
<P>
The decree was reportedly addressed to Abdullah two days ago
and king Fahd received a written response from the prince.
</P>
<P>
"Because we wish to spend some time resting and recuperating
and because of your highness' good character, we entrust you to
take over management of government affairs while we enjoy rest and
recuperation,'' the decree said.
</P>
<P>
King Fahd is believed to suffer overweight and diabetes. On
November 30, he was admitted to a hospital for "temporary health
emergency." Reports had it that he suffered a minor stroke and
declining health.
</P>
<P>
The publicity of the royal decree cast a shadow over the king's
well-being and would for certain cause jitters in oil markets of
the vast oil-producing country, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Prince Abdullah, in a letter to the king, said nothing would
make him happier than seeing King Fahd back at the helm. He also
said that he would consult the monarch "whenever I find myself in
need for your counsel and recommendations."
</P>
<P>
Abdullah commands the kingdom's powerful National Guard, a
well-armed and 80,000-strong contingent, which is known to be
highly loyal to the royal family.
</P>
<P>
Fahd, who has a long history of health problems and used a cane
to walk in recent years, ascended to the throne in 1982 to succeed
his brother Khaled. He chose Abdullah as his heir apparent.
</P>
<P>
A vast desert country with a population of 17 million, Saudi
Arabia produces 8 million barrels of oil per day. Under Fahd,
Saudi Arabia has in recent years been a staunch U.S. ally and a
key player in the Middle East politics.

<HEADLINE> Chief Negotiator: Syrian-Israeli Talks Serious </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Syrian chief negotiator Walid
al-Muallem has described the recent Syrian-Israeli talks in the
U.S. state of Maryland as helpful and serious, though there was
still a gap between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
He made the comment during an interview which was published in
today's official newspaper "Tishrin."
</P>
<P>
He said the Maryland talks were a reconnaissance dealing with
all essential elements of peace.
</P>
<P>
"We heard a better tone, as well as better statements, but we
did not feel that any commitments were made during the
negotiations," he said.
</P>
<P>
After a six-month deadlock, Israel and Syria resumed their
peace talks in Maryland last week amid high hopes for a
breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
"The negotiators have wide powers, with the exception of the
power to make a decision. Decision-making is always in the hands
of the leadership of either side. So what is taking place is an
exchange of views," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to Muallem, U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher will start another round of shuttle diplomacy in the
Middle East to obtain decisions from the leaderships of both
parties.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question on whether the negotiations will last
long, Muallem affirmed that this depends on how serious the
Israeli side is.
</P>
<P>
He noted that although the factor of time is important, it
should not constitute a pressure on the negotiators.
</P>
<P>
He also said that upgrading the level of negotiations was
not being considered for the time being.

<HEADLINE> China's Largest Offshore Gas Field Starts Pumping Gas To Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANYA, January 1 (Xinhua) -- A natural gas platform, 91
kilometers south of the Hainan Island, began to pump gas to Hong
Kong early this morning through a 778-km-long gas pipeline.
</P>
<P>
The Yacheng 13-1 Natural Gas Field, located on the South China
Sea, extends 53 square kilometers with a total reserve of 96.8
billion cu m of natural, and therefore it is acclaimed as China's
largest offshore natural gas field.
</P>
<P>
Starting from today, the gas field will provide 2.9 billion cu
m of natural gas annually for the New Territory in Hong Kong for a
power station with a generating capacity of 2.4 million kilowatts
each year, said a spokesman from the China National Offshore Oil
Corporation (CNOOC).
</P>
<P>
The underwater natural gas pipeline, extending from the gas
production platform to Hong Kong and buried 90 to 157 meters deep
in seabed, is also the world's second longest offshore pipeline,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"Sending natural gas from the Hainan gas field to Hong Kong is
the result of the joint efforts by several sides," said Ruan
Chongwu, party secretary and governor of Hainan Province. Ruan
also expressed his hope that the relations between Hainan Province
and Hong Kong will be enhanced with the event as the beginning.
</P>
<P>
With a total investment of 1.2 billion US dollars, Yacheng
13-1 natural gas field, which includes offshore production
facilities, submarine oil and gas pipelines, and on-shore
terminals for the processing of oil and gas, has been jointly
developed and built by CNOOC, Arco China Inc of the United States
and a Kuwait oil company since April, 1994.
</P>
<P>
According to an official in charge of the project, the offshore
platform and the production facilities in Yacheng 13-1 natural gas
field have a designed service life of 30 years. The pipeline has a
designed service life of 40 years, both of which have been proved
to have attained the international standard.
</P>
<P>
As one of the key construction projects of the state, Yacheng
13-1 Natural Gas Field has been hailed as an example in China's
foreign cooperation in offshore oil exploitation.
</P>
<P>
"The 700-km-long offshore pipeline can be a new cooperation
belt between south China and Hong Kong and will surely serve to
promote the development of Hong Kong so as to maintain Hong Kong's
long-term prosperity," said Liao Xun, deputy director of Hainan
Economic Research and Development Center.

<HEADLINE> Rosy Prospects Loom for Cyprus Economy in 1996 (By Huang Jianming) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 1 (Xinhua) -- A bullish outlook for the Cyprus
economy is predicted as the year 1995 witnessed good performance
of the island's economy.
</P>
<P>
In the 1996 budget presentation to the House of
Representatives, Finance Minister Christodoulos Christodoulou told
deputies that economic prospects appeared favorable. He forecast
that the economic growth rate in 1996 is expected to stay at 4.5
percent and unemployment to fluctuate around the same levels of
about 2.5 percent as registered in 1995. The fiscal deficit is
estimated to reach 168 million Cyprus pounds (about 336 million
U.S. dollars) or 4.1 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
According to a survey by the Cyprus Financial Mirror, most
economists here agree that the economy in 1996 will grow at an
average rate of 3.7 percent, with the highest forecast at 4.2
percent and the lowest at 3.2 percent, as against the 5 percent
growth rate in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Economists generally agree that a growth rate of about 3.5-4.5
percent is very satisfactory in view of the fact that the economy
is more matured than five years ago, when the island's economy
growth rates stood at 6 percent or more.
</P>
<P>
They believe that the sound economy is based mostly on the
robust increase in tourism revenues, which for 1996 are expected
to register a 5 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the island's revenues from its tourism industry, which
President Glafcos Clerides has described as a "blood donor" to
the economy, amounted to 850 million Cyprus pounds (about 1.7
billion U.S. dollars), an increase of 4 percent over the 1994
figure with 2.2 million visitors coming to the island.
</P>
<P>
Tourism is one of the service industries, which also include
banking, insurance, accounting, legal and other related
services.
</P>
<P>
The service sector now accounts for about 65 percent of the GDP
and more than 55 percent of the working population.
</P>
<P>
However, the outlook for manufacture sector is less
optimistic. According to the economists, the average increase rate
in manufacturing is only 1.6 percent, with the highest forecast at
3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The projected meager growth rate in the sector may be
attributed to the island's continuing structural problems, the
foremost of which are swelling wage bills and a fierce competition
by the industrial units on the island.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the inflation rate is predicted to be at 3.5
percent, compared with the 1995 figure of 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus government managed to bring lower the inflation
rate in 1995 to 3 percent from 4.7 percent in 1994, however,
it seems that the trend may be reversed due to the negative
effects from the Tariff Proposals which envisage huge rises in
import levies on foodstuffs.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate is expected to remain at 2.6 percent,
unchanged from that of last year.

<HEADLINE> New Year's Day Celebrated Across China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Dancing, shopping, performances
of local operas, concerts, art shows and sports activities are the
major forms of New Year's Day celebrations across China.
</P>
<P>
In Beijing, China's capital city, 300 fruit-growing farmers
from Yuncheng City, north China's Shanxi Province presented nine
large apples to the flag-raising soldiers in Tian'anmen Square,
the heart of Beijing, to extend their festival greetings to the
soldiers. At 7:36 A.M. today, the women farmers watched the
flag-raising ceremony, together with 100,000 other people who came
to attend the event.
</P>
<P>
Today's Beijing became a sea of red flags. The bustling
business centers in Xidan, Wangfujing and a number of other major
shopping centers were full of shoppers. Under the bright sunshine,
people visited tourist spots and parks in the city.
</P>
<P>
In Shanghai, China's largest industrial city, a tea reception
was hosted by the municipal government, attended by Huang Ju,
member of the Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party
Central Committee and party secretary of CPC Shanghai Municipal
Committee and 300 people.
</P>
<P>
In Tianjin, the largest port city in North China, local
officials celebrated the New Year's Day in a special form --
visiting local people in financial difficulty with aid in the form
of cash, clothes and food.
</P>
<P>
As part of the Fifth Shandong Art Festival, art troupes in
eight cities of the Shandong Province staged local opera
performances. A New Year Concert was also attended by over 2,000
music fans in Hangzhou, capital city of east China's Zhejiang
Province on the last day of 1995. A local opera performance
jointly staged by Zhejiang Television Station and Shanxi
Television Station became the center of attraction in the city
this evening.
</P>
<P>
Concerts, art shows and sports games have also attracted
hundreds of thousands of local people in Inner Mongolia, Xi'an,

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Newspaper "National Concord" To Come Out Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's newspaper "National
Concord" will resume to be at the newsstands tomorrow after about
18 months of absence.
</P>
<P>
A statement by the company's deputy managing director, Stanley
Egbochukwu, said, "The Concord press of Nigeria is totally
committed to the cause of truth and justice...to the Nigerian
nation, we pledge our continued loyalty to our readers, our
commitment to remain in the vanguard of the collective aspiration
of the Nigerian people."
</P>
<P>
The Concord and Punch newspapers were proscribed on June 11,
1994, by the Nigerian military government.
</P>
<P>
The publisher of the Concord, Moshood Abiola, has been
detained since June 23, 1994, waiting for trial on treason
charge.
</P>
<P>
Abiola, widely believed to have won the June 12, 1993
presidential election, the total result of which was not made
public and was later annulled by the former military government
led by Ibrahim Babangida, declared himself President of Nigeria
in June 1994 before his detention.
</P>
<P>
On October 1, 1995, Nigerian Head of State General Sani Abacha
announced the lifting of the ban on the two newspapers. Punch has
since returned to the newsstands.

<HEADLINE> New Year's Bell Rings in Heavenly City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, January 1 (Xinhua) -- More than 400 overseas tourists
had a special new year's celebration last night: listening to the
ringing of the new year's bell in an ancient temple in this ``City
of Heaven''.
</P>
<P>
The tourists, each holding a small lantern in his hands, held
their breath while listening to the echo of the bell in the
remarkable night.
</P>
<P>
And when the year 1996 arrived with the bell ringing for the
108 times, the tourists exchanged their blessings to each other,
though they came from 12 different nations and territories from
around the world and did not know each other.
</P>
<P>
The bell of the Jingci Temple at the foot of the Nanping
Mountain has been well-known. ``The evening bell of Nanping'' was
once among the top 10 attractions on the bank of the West Lake, to
which Hangzhou owes its great reputation as a major tourist city
of China.
</P>
<P>
The new year's bell of Jingci Temple was restored by the city's
tourism authority a few years ago and has proved a success in the
development of the city's ancient heritage as a tourism resource.
</P>
<P>
After boating on the West Lake yesterday, the tourists then
came to the temple and were entertained with the traditional lion
dance.
</P>
<P>
About 23: 40, the elderly abbot in kasaya ascended the bell
tower and rang the first ring for the 1,000-odd audience gathered
below.
</P>
<P>
The last ring marking the arrival of the new year was
immediately greeted from the crowd.
</P>
<P>
A simple ceremony was then held for the opening of 1996 as the
year of vacationing and leisure, which was attended by Zhejiang's
deputy governor Long Anding, Zhangzhou vice-mayor Hua Lizhen, and
head of the Zhejiang Provincial Bureau of Tourism Yu
Jianming.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai's Financial Revenues up Last year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, China's leading
manufacturing and business center, scored a 19 percent increase in
revenues in 1995, a senior municipal government official announced
here today.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Youdao, director of the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau,
said that Shanghai's total revenues amounted to a record 44.2
billion yuan last year.
</P>
<P>
He said that the figure included 25.2 billion yuan in
consumption and value-added taxes.
</P>
<P>
Revenues of the Shanghai municipal government came to 22.7
billion yuan last year, a 29 percent increase from 1994, he said.
</P>
<P>
The figure included 21.7 billion yuan in industrial and
commercial tax, up 27 percent from 1994, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhou, the big increase in the city's revenues was
due primarily to an ever-growing economy, the stepped-up reform of
the financial and tax system and the readjustment of the city's
economic structure.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Guangzhou, the capital of
Guangdong Province in south China, celebrated the 2,210th
anniversary of its founding today.
</P>
<P>
The first morning of 1996 found the square in front of the city
government a sea of people and colourful flags. The series of
activities marking the great anniversary were launched here.
</P>
<P>
The celebrations started with the unveiling of a six-m-high
glass statue of five goats, the symbol of Guangzhou and the mascot
chosen for the rare occasion.
</P>
<P>
The mascot, Qingqing, is holding rice ears and kapok flowers in
its right hand, which implies celebrations, auspiciousness and
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Historical records show that the city of Guangzhou was
established as early as in the year 214 B.C.
</P>
<P>
Today, Guangzhou is one of the richest cities of the
nation. After three straight years of an annual 20 percent growth,
the city's GDP value grossed 125 billion yuan in 1995. This
averaged about 18,000 yuan for each of its citizens, the highest
among all the Chinese urban inhabitants.

The Taliban student militia fired a salvo of around 14 rockets
and hit the southern residential areas of the city, Afghan defense

The attack came after President Burhanuddin Rabbani made an

<HEADLINE> UK Banks to Cut 20,000 Jobs This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 1 (Xinhua) -- The British banking and finance
industry will cut its workforce by 20,000 jobs this year, the
Banking Insurance and Finance Union (BIFU) warned Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In spite of an expected multi-billion pound profit for the
banking sector this year, it is already planning to further cut
staff, said the BIFU, the country's main banking and finance union.
</P>
<P>
Those reductions will mean customers getting a poorer service,
the BIFU added.
</P>
<P>
Over the past six years, the industry has already lost more
than 120,000 jobs and there was no return of the feelgood factor,
said Ed Sweeney, BIFU's new general secretary.
</P>
<P>
Banking may have once been considered a job for life but job
insecurity is now a feature of the finance sector, with further
threats likely in the increasingly competitive industry.
</P>
<P>
Banks where the BIFU fears job losses will be greatest include
National Westminster, Midland and Royal Bank of Scotland.
</P>
<P>
The BIFU is also concerned that mergers among banks and
building societies will produce additional redundancies.
</P>
<P>
With a Private Member's Bill to merge Lloyds and TSB banks
likely to reach the parliament this year, "we will be lobbying MPs
hard to oppose this bill if it means more job losses and a worse
choice for customers," said Sweeney.

<HEADLINE> UK Navy Watchs on Spanish Fishing Fleet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 1 (Xinhua) -- A British Navy fishery protection
vessel is now patroling in the Irish Box area as the prime fishing
area is opened for the first time to the Spanish fishing fleet.
</P>
<P>
The Royal Navy fishery protection vessel Lindisfarne left
Portsmouth on Sunday to police the area between southern Irish and
English coasts as the new European Union (EU) fishing agreement
came into effect at midnight.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, which won a majority support in the EU in
December of 1994, some 40 Spanish fishing vessels are permitted to
fish in the 92,000 square miles Irish Box at one time.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Fisheries Minister Tony Baldry said that the
protection vessels would be supported by surveillance aircraft,
and every time a Spanish vessel entered or left the area it had to
notify British authorities.
</P>
<P>
"I have no reason to doubt the Spanish authorities will comply
with requirements of the new EU legislation," Baldry said.
</P>
<P>
He also rejected suggestions that Spain would be increasing its
fishing quotas, saying "although the Spanish are allowed to fish
in parts of the Irish Box, they will have to use their existing
quotas and they do not get extra quota to fish there."
</P>
<P>
Britain was determined to police the area properly, Baldry
added. If illegal vessels were found in the British waters, they
would be taken in, prosecuted and be fined up to 50,000 pounds
(about 80,000 U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> TDC Predicts Greater Access to Japan Toys Market for HK Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Japan has surged to become the
 fourth largest market for Hong Kong toy products, after the
United States, Britain and Germany, according to a research
report on the Japanese market prepared by the Hong Kong Trade
Development Council (TDC).
</P>
<P>
The report shows that large Japanese retail stores which want
to maintain their competitive edge are raising the ratio of direct
 imports from overseas manufacturers. Smaller retailers are
forming buying groups so as to import directly from overseas
suppliers.
</P>
<P>
"Japan's toys distribution system is undergoing structural
changes. In the face of increased competition among retailers,
the multi-layers of wholesale are being simplified," said Francis
Wong, TDC's exhibition manager. The Council organizes an
international toy and games fair here later this month.
</P>
<P>
"This gives rise to new opportunities which are expected to
benefit Hong Kong companies," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The shift of Hong Kong's toy industry across the border to
China's mainland has been reducing domestic exports and burgeoning
 re-exports. Hong Kong remains an important control center,
managing production in neighboring countries and export shipment,
and serves as the regional base for Japanese buyers in sourcing
toy imports from other Asian countries," he added.
</P>
<P>
In the first ten months of 1995, the value of Hong Kong toys
export increased 14 percent to 70 billion HK dollars (8.97 billion
 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
China has overtaken the newly industrialized economies as the
leading toy supplier to Japan. In 1992, China accounted for 47.6
percent of the total amount of Japan's toys import and 56 percent
in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Crack Down on Potato Hoarders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Ali Akbar
Hashemi today vowed to get tougher on hoarders of potato that
"create discontent" among the people.
</P>
<P>
On the first day of the new year, the president even called
for the establishment of "more mobile courts" that would issue
their judgments at the place where government inspectors find the
price violation.
</P>
<P>
A 400-percent price increase for potatoes in the past three
months has created a furor among many Iranians who cannot afford
to buy the main staple for the Iranian dishes.
</P>
<P>
Recently the Iranian government banned the exportation of
potatoes in a bid to control its price hike.
</P>
<P>
However, the prices have remained high because of hoarding.
</P>
<P>
"The potato produced in Iran responds to domestic needs, both
qualitatively and quantitatively," Agriculture Minister Issa
Kalantari was quoted as saying by Tehran Radio.
</P>
<P>
But, he admitted, "hoarding and gradual sale of potato in the
market has caused the price hike."
</P>
<P>
In a recent move to control the potato price, the government
declared that it will punish anyone who is storing more than 10
tons of potatoes.
</P>
<P>
The price increase is not limited to the potatoes in Iran's
inflationary economy. Runaway inflation is affecting the prices
of other goods and commodities.
</P>
<P>
The Persian daily, Salam, reported Sunday that between March
23 to September 23, the prices for goods and services in urban
areas increased by an average 52.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
With only 12 weeks left to Iranian new year Nowruz falling on
March 21, the Iranian economy has become volatile.
</P>
<P>
The Persian daily, Akhbar, reported today that the black market
for dollar thrived despite the government ban on foreign currency
black market.
</P>
<P>
The daily said that the sellers were openly dealing at
Ferdowsi Square near downtown Tehran.

Today, a world-class tourism zone is being built at the Bay,
which will include bathing beaches, a golf court, a five-star
hotel, a large underground parking lot, and programs such as
submarine touring and cliff diving will be developed in the zone.
</P>
<P>
"Those investing here are bound to gain good returns," says a

was a construction company staffed with former navy engineering
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
"We have built a lot of military works on the island as well as
fortresses along the seashore in Sanya, but our top pride is the
Central Square of Along Bay." says Chen Zongming, general manager
of the company, who served for dozens of years in the navy.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Sanya remains a sea frontier. A navy lieutenant
colonel says that his fleet has a tight training schedule, and
many people come to visit his fleet and have lessons on national
defense each year.
</P>
<P>
Party Secretary Zhong Wen voices his confidence in peace, "All
China's neighbors are busy developing their national economies,
and I don't think anyone really wants a war. We will devote
ourselves to economic expansion since the ultimate contest is
always fought in the economic arena in the world today."

<HEADLINE> HK Air Cargo Throughput Hits Record in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Kai Tak Airport
had a record year in the international cargo throughput in 1995 by
handling about 1.4 million tons of cargoes, local media reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Anthony Charter, managing director of Hong Kong Air Cargo
Terminals Limited (HATCL), said that the figure represents a
growth of more than 11 percent compared with 1994.
</P>
<P>
Kai Tak Airport is the second busiest international air cargo
airport in the world, just after Japan's Norita.
</P>
<P>
Last year, HATCL, the sole provider of cargo handling services
at HK airport, introduced pre-arrival customs clearance to speed
up cargo handling process.
</P>
<P>
Under the scheme, it gets the cargo documentation from the
cargo agents and the airlines and clears the consignments in
advance of the agents' arrival at the airport.
</P>
<P>
Looking into this year, Charter said that the airports in south
China will not pose a threat to Kai Tak Airport.
</P>
<P>
Instead, Kai Tak will benefit from the economic growth in south
China, he added.

SANYA (Hainan), January 1 (Xinhua) -- Although reputed to be
the First Bay under the Sun, Along Bay in China's island province
of Hainan has never witnessed such a grand ceremony.
</P>
<P>
On this New Year's day, the former military frontier facing the
South China Sea was the chief meeting-place for the opening
ceremony of '96 China Holiday, which is this year's theme
designated for China's tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people gathered on the beach today. As Chinese
Vice Premier Qian Qichen declared the start of '96 China Holiday,
hundreds of pigeons were released to the blue sky.
</P>
<P>
For visitors, the silvery sands, the sapphirine sea, the
rolling mountains and the verdant tropical plants in their sight
mark Along Bay out as an excellent natural resort; but for those
who have lived in Sanya city for years, they have seen remarkable
changes from the Bay.
</P>
<P>
Sanya, with the old name of Yazhou, used to be a bleak
destination for relegated officials in feudal ages. During World
War Two, the Japanese invaders turned it into a military base for
aggression against Southeast Asia. And Sanya remained a military
bastion for decades after the founding of New China in 1949.
</P>
<P>
Only after China adopted the reform and opening policy in 1978,
did Sanya, China's southernmost city, start a period of fast
economic expansion.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this morning, Yacheng 13-1 natural gas field 91 km
south of Sanya, which is China's biggest offshore gas field,
started to provide natural gas for Hong Kong; and hours later,
Sanya greeted this grand occasion for the Chinese tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
Zhong Wen, secretary of Sanya City Committee of the Chinese
Communist Party, describes the city as "a phoenix flying from the
ends of the earth", because the Phoenix International Airport
linking Sanya with the world was named after a nearby village.
</P>
<P>
Zhong also regards changes in Sanya as "an epitome of China
taking economic development as the top priority."
</P>
<P>
Before 1978, Sanya was a remote town with a population of
20,000 and an area of 2.5 sq km. Today, the city, inhabited by
120,000 people and expanding its area to 18.5 sq km, boasts of 49
high-grade roads, eight overwater bridges, 58,000 lines of program
controlled telephones and 15 star-rated hotels.
</P>
<P>
Some local celebrities' experiences and the change of their
ideas may represent the changes which have taken place in Sanya in
the past decades.
</P>
<P>
Zhong Wen used to be the Party secretary for an army production
and construction corps. At that time, he had only one thought,
namely, to produce strategic materials like rubber as much as
possible to support national defense.
</P>
<P>
Now, he says he thinks of issues much more complicated. Sanya
should "take in more investment, and be linked with the world
market", Zhong says, adding that he must understand and promote
market economy to lead Sanya into a new age of opening to the
outside world.
</P>
<P>
The top concern for Liu Mingyan, chief of the local environment
and natural resources bureau, is to ensure Along Bay protected
from pollution.

Chamber of Commerce will devote its efforts to the maintenance of
Hong Kong's prosperity and stability in the coming year, said
Tsang Hin-chi, chairman of the chamber, at a new-year reception
held here today.
</P>
<P>

Kong Special Administrative Region to be set up soon, said that in
the past year, his chamber was active in promoting cooperation
and exchanges with the industrial and business associations in
the Chinese mainland as well as in the world.
</P>
<P>
He said that the chamber has recently signed an agreement with
the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, aiming to
enhance trade cooperation between Hong Kong and the mainland.
</P>
<P>
In December, the chamber attended the Third Overseas Chinese
Businessmen Congress held in Bangkok, Thailand, and it achieved
its objective in helping more overseas Chinese businessmen know
the economic potential of the mainland and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
According to Tsang, the Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of
Commerce will set up an office in Beijing early this year to
provide the members of the chamber with economic and trade
information.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Iran to Protest U.S. Congressional Covert-Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Iran claimed here today that it
will lodge a protest with the United Nations and the International
Court of Justice in The Hague if Washington does not reject the
congressional act against the Islamic Republic.
</P>
<P>
Mahmoud Mohammadi, the spokesman for the Foreign Ministry,
noted that the latest anti-Iran congressional move is in
contradiction to all international obligations and practices, and
is a flagrant violation of the U.N. Charter.
</P>
<P>
While addressing a group of university students, he said, "era
of anarchy in international relations has ended and the United
States is obliged to respect international laws and commitments."
</P>
<P>
Based on international laws and regulations, he stressed,
governments are responsible for all actions of their parliaments
if their actions contradict international laws.
</P>
<P>
He noted that certain international obligations should come
before domestic laws.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi said that Article II of the U.N. Charter, which the
U.S. considers itself as one of its initiators, clearly bars all
U.N. members from resorting to force and posing threat on
territorial integrity and political independence of other
countries.
</P>
<P>
However, Iran's Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri
Sunday called for the allocation of a budget as a tit-for-tat
measure to fight back U.S. covert-action against the Islamic
Republic.
</P>
<P>
But, he did not specify how much he wants to earmark for the
special counter measures.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the relations between Washington and
Tehran seem to be much more intense as both sides are preparing
the presidential elections.

<HEADLINE> Hariri: Lebanese and Syrian Tracks of Mideast Peace Negotiations Inseparable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri affirmed that the Lebanese and Syrian tracks of the Middle
East peace negotiations are inseparable.
</P>
<P>
In an interview published by Lebanese newspaper Al-Nahar today,
Hariri said: "So far all signs indicate that Israel is serious
about the peace process. And Syria has long been serious about the
peace process."
</P>
<P>
About the effect of the Syrian-Israeli negotiations on the
Lebanese-Israeli ones, the Lebanese prime minister said: "Stress
is now being laid on the Syrian-Israeli track, because the
outstanding problems between Syria and Israel are more than those
between Lebanon and Israel."
</P>
<P>
"The process of negotiations between Lebanon and Israel is
governed by U.N. Security Council Resolution 425, but the process
of negotiations between Syria and Israel is governed by
U.N. Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, which are based on
the land-for-peace principle," he said.
</P>
<P>
"As for Resolution 425, it is based on the
withdrawal-for-security principle," he added.
</P>
<P>
"In order to protect Lebanon from any Israeli oppression in
the peace negotiations... and in order to protect Syria from being
dealt with separately, Lebanon and Syrian have agreed that Lebanon
should sign no peace agreement (with Israel) before Syria does
so, and vice versa," Hariri explained.

<P>
JERUSALEM, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister Ehud
Barak has predicted that negotiations with Syria will be long and
difficult and the results are impossible to predict, Israel Radio
said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to Israeli ambassadors in Europe Sunday night by
phone, Barak said that Israel wants a full and permanent peace
with Syria, but not "a peace at any price."
</P>
<P>
He praised the new open approach to the negotiations by Syria,
but said that it is still too early to conclude whether Syria is
committed to a genuine peace.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Sunday, in a meeting with a delegation from the Golan
Residents Committee, Barak said that both sides "had yet to talk
about substance, and it will take more time to know whether there
is a partner to negotiate with," according to a Foreign Ministry
statement.
</P>
<P>
Israel and Syria resumed peace negotiations on December 27 in
eastern Maryland, near Washington, and concluded the first round
of talks on December 29.
</P>
<P>
Negotiators from both sides are set to resume discussion on
January 3 for another three days under the mediation of a U.S.
team led by Middle East peace coordinator Dennis Ross.
</P>
<P>
Despite the very positive atmosphere at the first-round
negotiations, both the Israeli and Syrian teams said nothing has
been agreed upon.

<HEADLINE> Yangtze River Yields more Power </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Yangtze River, the longest river
of China and a major source of disasters in the past, has become
one of the most important sources of electricity for the nation
nowadays.
</P>
<P>
According to information released by the Yangtze River Water
Resources Committee, power plants built or being built on the
Yangtze River and its tributaries boast a total installed
generating capacity of 42 million kw.
</P>
<P>
These power plants can generate 186.8 billion kwh of
electricity a year, which is more than 3,000 times over that of
1949.
</P>
<P>
Running almost the whole west-to-east length of the Chinese
land, Yangtze River has a fall of 5,400 m on its 6,300-km-long
journey before emptying into the East China Sea. It is estimated
that the power reserve of the river exceeds 268 million kw.
</P>
<P>
Statistics by the committee indicate that there are now 17
large and nearly 60 medium-sized and hundreds of small power
plants operational in the Yangtze River valley.
</P>
<P>
These power plants are not only producing a huge amount of
power critical to the Chinese economy, but also playing a fatal
role in flood control, irrigation and shipping, committee sources
said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: IMF Removes Philippines from Poor Countries' list </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 1 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
has removed the Philippines from the list of poor countries
requiring special balance of payments (BOP) assistance from the
fund due to the country's continued growth in recent years.
</P>
<P>
According to Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson, the IMF has
informed him that the Philippines has been deleted from the list
of countries eligible for the enhanced structural adjustment
facility (ESAF), which are low interest loans extended to low
income countries facing protracted BOP problems.
</P>
<P>
However, countries who avail of the ESAF must institute tough
macroeconomics and structural policy adjustments.
</P>
<P>
The IMF noted that the Philippine's per capital income in 1994
rose to 960 US dollars as against 770 US dollars in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The cut off point for such IMF assistance in 1994 was the per
capital income of 865 US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The IMF also noted that the Philippines has hurdled the BOP
difficulties that had hounded it in the past.
</P>
<P>
The IMF cited the significant progress the Ramos administration
has achieved in restoring macroeconomic stability and in advancing
exchange and trade liberalization, regulatory reform and
privatization.
</P>
<P>
It particularly highlighted the fact that the external debt
service has been reduced from 33 percent of exports in 1991 to a
projected 16 percent of exports in 1995.
</P>
<P>
This is parallel to the decrease in the external debt burden to
52 percent from 65 percent of the gross domestic product over the
same period.
</P>
<P>
The IMF observed that the Philippine's ability to service
non-concessional debts and its return and continued access to the
international capital markets.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that losing eligibility to the ESAF marks the
graduation of the Philippines and is a step closer to its eventual
exit from the IMF guidance.
</P>
<P>
Government officials indicated that its current program with
the IMF will be its last.

<HEADLINE> Senior Researcher Calls for Stronger Health Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 1 (Xinhua) -- A leading medical scholar has
called for stronger health education among the public to prevent
chronic diseases caused by bad habits and behaviors.
</P>
<P>
Chen Ningqing, head of the Preventive Medicine Center of the
People's Liberation Army, made the appeal at the recent Academic
Symposium on the Public Health of China in the 21st Century.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the incidence rate of chronic and non-infective
diseases caused by bad behaviors has been increasing in China in
recent years. Such diseases, including hypertension, tumor,
coronary heart disease, cerebral apoplexy and diabetes now account
for 70 percent of the deaths.
</P>
<P>
With the tempo of life getting faster and competitions fiercer,
the incidence rate of mental disorder is also rising in China. An
epidemiological survey in 1994 showed that China's incidence rate
of severe mental disease is 11 per thousand, approaching the level
of developed nations.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, health education remains very weak among the
elders, the intellectuals and the impoverished population in the
poor and remote regions, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Successful health education will be able to save 1.5 million
lives for China by the year 2010, Chen predicted.
</P>
<P>
Towards that, the Health News reported recently that a health
education program designed for the country's 900 million rural
population has come to cover tv networks across a dozen provinces,
since it was started in July 1994.
</P>
<P>
The program is jointly sponsored by the Central Committee for
Patriotic Public Health Campaign, the Ministry of Public Health,
the Ministry of Radio, Film and Television, and the Ministry of
Agriculture.

<HEADLINE> Top Chinese Leaders Attend CPPCC-Sponsored Reception (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Jiang stressed the importance of giving full scope to
the role of a united patriotic front and promoting the unity of
the Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
He recalled that in the past year CPPCC's at all levels and
various non-communist parties, mass organizations and patriotic
personages without party affiliation have played an important role
in China's political and social life by actively participating in
administering and discussing political affairs.
</P>
<P>
He also praised members of the CPPCC National Committee for
making good proposals concerning the formulation of the Ninth
Five-Year Plan and the long-range goal for the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
Promoting China's reunification is the "common aspiration" of
the compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan Straits, represents
the fundamental interests of the Chinese nation and is an
irresistible historical trend, he said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that the Chinese people with a
tradition of patriotism for several thousand years will certainly
be able to overcome any interference and accomplish reunification
of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We will continue to handle the Taiwan issue in
accordance with the principle of 'peaceful reunification and one
country, two systems' and further push forward economic and
cultural exchanges and cooperation across the Taiwan Straits."
</P>
<P>
During the Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000) China will
resume the exercise of its sovereignty over Hong Kong and Macao.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang pledged that the Chinese government is
committed to acting in accordance with the basic laws governing
the Hong Kong and Macao special administrative regions, making a
success of preparations in all areas, realizing successful
transfer and smooth transition of power in the two regions, and
maintaining long-term prosperity and stability there.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the new year the Chinese government will, as
always, pursue the foreign policy of independence and peace,
expand cooperation and exchanges with various countries on the
basis of five principles of peaceful coexistence, and make due
contributions to world peace, development and progress.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the reception, Li Peiyao, vice-chairman of the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said, "We
support the solemn stand of the Chinese Communist Party and the
Chinese government on the Taiwan question, and resolutely oppose
attempts to create 'two Chinas,' 'one China, one Taiwan'
and 'independence of Taiwan'."
</P>
<P>
China's reunification is an inevitable trend of historical
development and no force in the world can stop it, said Li,
who is also chairman of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary
Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang.

<P>
BEIJING, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Top Chinese leaders Jiang Zemin,
Li Peng, Qiao Shi, Li Ruihuan, Zhu Rongji, Liu Huaqing, Hu Jintao
and Rong Yiren today attended a tea reception to mark the New Year
Day sponsored by the National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC).
</P>
<P>
Li Ruihuan, a Standing Committee member of the Political Bureau
of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee and chairman of
the CPPCC National Committee, presided over the reception and
extended greetings to those present.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the Party Central Committee and the State Council,
President Jiang Zemin extended New Year greetings to members of
various non-communist parties, patriotic personages without party
affiliation, people of various ethnic groups, workers, farmers,
intellectuals, Party and government officials, officers and men of
the People's Liberation Army, officers and men of the armed police
and police officers, as well as Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao
compatriots, overseas Chinese, and foreign friends supporting and
helping China's modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
He said that led by the Party, the Chinese people of various
ethnic groups have scored new achievements in the modernization
drive in the past year.
</P>
<P>
China now enjoys a growing economy, political stability and
unity among people of various ethnic groups, and is making steady
social progress, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Full of confidence, the industrious and brave Chinese people
are greeting new opportunities, new challenges and a new century,"
he told the reception.
</P>
<P>
The leader also cited a number of problems and difficulties to
which he said close attention must be paid. Those include a weak
foundation for agriculture, difficulties encountered by many
state-owned enterprises in production and operation, a poor
security order in some areas as well as a relatively high price
increase range.
</P>
<P>
This year China will begin to implement the Ninth Five-Year
Plan and the long-term target for the year 2010, he said,
adding: "A more arduous and glorious task is facing us."
</P>
<P>
"We must unswervingly take Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of
building socialism with Chinese characteristics as our guidance
and will not waver in adhering to the Party's basic line for 100
years to come," he stated.
</P>
<P>
According to Jiang, the formulation and implementation of the
Ninth Five-Year Plan and the long-range goal for the year 2010 is
vital to attaining China's strategic goals in three phases, to the
invigoration of the nation and China's future, to consolidating
achievements in reform, opening up and the modernization drive,
and to promoting the grand cause of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
To accomplish this glorious and arduous historical task, the
most fundamental principle is to adhere to Chinese Communist
Party's leadership, he said.

conditions, poor infrastructure and frequent disasters make
economic development almost stagnant.
</P>
<P>
The project in Qinghai was started in early 1994, involving
massive construction of farmlands, water conservancy facilities,
roads and grassland disaster reduction bases. The government
provided most of the industrial products used for the project.
</P>
<P>
Efforts were also made to help the impoverished areas develop
rural industry, cash crops and animal breeding.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the average annual income for farmers in the
poverty-struck areas have increased to 500 yuan, according to
official statistics

<HEADLINE> Tianjin Reports Record Grain Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Tianjin, a major manufacture
center of China, has reported a record two billion kg of grain
production this year, according to the Municipal Bureau of
Agriculture and Forestry.
</P>
<P>
The bureau estimates that the city's 6.65 million mu of
farmlands will yield 2.075 billion kg of grain this year, nine
percent up from 1994. The average production of 312 kg per mu is
four percent higher than that of last year.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the bureau contribute the record production to a
responsibility system between the municipal and local governments,
increased cultivation area and additional investment into the
agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
The adoption of new farming technologies also played a major
role, according to the officials. Some 78 million kg of increased
production can be attributed to the application of new
technologies on two million mu of farmlands.
</P>
<P>
Also, the city reported a good harvest of Xiaozhan rice, a type
of rice grown only in Tianjin and known for its deliciousness.
Total production of such rice this year is 387 million kg, a 70
million kg increase up from that of last year.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Introduce Risk-Based  Capital Adequacy System for Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to bank sources here today, the move initiated by the
Central Bangladesh Bank and approved by the Finance Ministry in
the past week is aimed at removing the structural weakness in the
banking sector now due to the continued slide in the quality of
banks' assets.
</P>
<P>
Under the new system, banks will be required to maintain 8
percent of their risk-weighted assets as capital adequacy, the
sources said, adding that the major variables which will determine
the risk are: cash in hand and in banks excepting banks abroad,
money at call and at short notice, foreign currency balances held,
export and other foreign bills, foreign investment, import and
inland bills, and advances.
</P>
<P>
Under the existing system, a scheduled bank has to maintain a
minimum 6 percent of its demand and time liabilities, or tk 200
million (5 million US dollars), in case of banks registered in
Bangladesh and tk 100 (2.5 million dollars) in case of banks
registered outside the country, whichever is more as capital
adequacy.
</P>
<P>
It was learnt that the central bank is expected to notify the
scheduled banks about the new system by next week and they will
have to implement it within 2 months of notification. But those
banks which will face problems in implementing the new system will
be given 2 years' time to acquire capital adequacy.

NEW DELHI, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister P.V.
Narasimha Rao, who had separate talks with the contending parties
on the Cauvery waters row on Sunday, will announce his decision on
the issue by Monday night, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release from the Tamil Nadu government,
Rao has requested Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalitha to remain
at Delhi and assured her that he would take a decision on the
state's demand for release of water to save standing crops by
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
But Chief Minister of Karnataka H.D. Deve Gowda said at a
press conference here that the prime minister did not give him any
indication about his decision during his meeting with him.
</P>
<P>
Rao's talks with the two chief ministers failed to make
headway with Tamil Nadu and Karnataka sticking to their respective
stands, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The talks were held at a request from the supreme court on
Thursday that the prime minister convene within two days a meeting
of top leaders of the concerned states to find out an amicable
solution to the waters dispute.
</P>
<P>
 Tamil Nadu has requested the neighboring Karnataka state to
release water immediately to save its standing crops. But the
latter insists that it is not in the position to do so because
there is adequate water available in Tamil Nadu at present to meet
the requirement of the crops in full.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President Issues New Year's Message </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
has called on the people to "focus mind, energy and attention on
settling social flare-ups that happened in the past and preventing
their recurrence in the future."
</P>
<P>
In his new year message, he explained that all flare-ups that
had happened in the past constituted a setback in the nation as a
whole. And any single day, month or year which Indonesia has
passed without social flare-ups would constitute a national
achievement that should be maintained.
</P>
<P>
On the country's political situation, the head of state said
the political climate at home was now on the rise. New ideas were
emerging while political openness was taking place. All these new
ideas must not get loose from control, he added.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto declared 1996 as the Year of Marine and Aerospace,
saying that "Indonesia should try hard to attract other nations to
visit this largest archipelagic country coupled with efforts to
intensifying control on our marine and aerospace."
</P>
<P>
On the economy, the president said in principle, the national
economic situation was encouraging in 1995.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the problem with the economy was how to
manage the high economic growth while not causing economic
overheating. Therefore, the government had taken necessary steps
to cool down the economic engine so that it could be speeded up on
time.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto said that the economic growth in 1995 will reach 7.1
percent with the inflation rate estimated at 8.64 percent.
</P>
<P>
Touching on economic relations with ASEAN and APEC, Soeharto
said that Indonesia was facing challenges and opportunities.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Indonesia must increase its efficiency and
competitiveness in facing these challenges.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 1 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi ruling and
opposition parties have held a long-expected discussion on the
issue of the opposition-demanded neutral caretaker government.
</P>
<P>
The talks which last nearly 2 hours were held at the residence
of US Ambassador to Dhaka David M. Merrill Sunday between a ruling
Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) team led by its Secretary
General Barrister Abdus Salam Talukdar and a 3-member opposition
team led by Amir Hossain Amu, presidium member of the Awami
(People's) League, the largest opposition party in the country.
</P>
<P>
Sources concerned disclosed that the two sides discussed the
appointment of a prime minister or chief advisor with all
executive powers to head an interim caretaker government.
</P>
<P>
No details about the meeting were available, but the sources
said that the ruling party had indicated the formation of a
10-member advisory council headed by President Abdur Rahman Biswas
with all executive power if the opposition endorsed the
proposition, while the opposition side disagreed, saying that the
president cannot head the government under the parliamentary
system.
</P>
<P>
According to other sources, the BNP put forward two conditions:
the head of the proposed interim government would have no
executive powers and the elections must be held within the
constitutional deadline of February 21. But the opposition side
insisted that the chief of the interim administration should have
executive powers and the polls be held within 90 days after the
resignation of Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia.
</P>
<P>
It was learnt that the parley was a follow-up of the December
24 meeting between BNP's Commerce and Information Minister Shamsul
Islam and the opposition's Amu.
</P>
<P>
The US Ambassador and Indian diplomats in Dhaka earlier had
several rounds of parley with Islam and Amu to break the
stalemate. But the two sides haggled on who is to head the interim
government after the prime minister's resignation.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Gains Momentum in Agricultural Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam produced one million tons
more of food grains in 1995, totalling 27.5 million tons,
according to a report from the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural
Development.
</P>
<P>
The country earned 1.3 billion U.S. dollars from its export of
agricultural produces in the past year, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The increase of agricultural production is of special
importance in that flash floods and typhoons time and again
inundated and raised havoc with the Mekong River delta and central
Vietnam, both being the country's production bases of food grains,
in the past year.
</P>
<P>
Growth was also posted in the cultivation and output of cash
and industrial crops, such as coffee, rubber, tea, cashew,
mulberry and sugarcane, as well as in the livestock breeding.
</P>
<P>
Some 150,000 hectares of coffee plants yielded 200,000 tons of
coffee beans which earned the country 560 million dollars via
exports in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The total number of pigs is estimated at 16 million head and
that of buffalo and cattle at 7 million head.
</P>
<P>
The ministerial report said the increase of the past year is
expected to help Vietnam reach its goal of producing 30-32 million
tons of food grains in the 1996-2000 period.

COLOMBO, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Tamil rebels, the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), ambushed an army
contingent in eastern Batticaloa District Sunday, killing four
soldiers and wounding three others, military sources said today.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE, which has waged a 13 year war for a separate state
during which over 50,000 persons have been killed, suffered heavy
reversals in their homeland Jaffna peninsula in December. Since
then, they have been concentrating their attacks in the east.
</P>
<P>
Following the ambush, the rebels had attempted to flee in boats
through the Batticaloa lagoon but military reinforcements had been
able to give chase and kill three of them.
</P>
<P>
Military intelligence said that the rebels have about 30
suicide bombers in Batiicaloa, who have been assigned the task of
killing high ranking military officers and civil administrators.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the suicide bombers, the LTTE is also using
parcel and letter bombs to kill their targets in the east. Two
such letter bombs addressed to senior army personnel were
detected and defused by the bomb detection squad recently.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Pledges to First Deal With Unemployment in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 31 (Xinhua) -- President Jacques Chirac pledged
today to give priority to solving France's unemployment problem in
the coming year.
</P>
<P>
In his New Year's Eve address, Chirac said he has been dealing
with the problem ever since he was sworn in seven months ago.
</P>
<P>
He said he has tried to cut the budget deficit, reduce the
population of long-term unemployment and promote the development
of small and medium-sized enterprises, all aimed at curtailing the
country's 11.5-percent unemployment rate.
</P>
<P>
The president urged the government to draw a lesson from the
recent labor unrest, the worst since 1968.
</P>
<P>
He said the strikes have demonstrated that the French public
felt anxious about and anguished by social insecurity.
</P>
<P>
Chirac noted that the struggle against unemployment is
inseparable from that against social rejection.
</P>
<P>
Two proposals made by French Prime Minister Alain Juppe
regarding reforms in France's debt-ridden social security system
triggered off a three-and-a-half-week strike which disrupted the
social and economic order of the country.

<HEADLINE> Lu Ping on Future of Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Lu Ping, director of the Hong
Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, today called
on Hong Kong people to join in the work towards a stable
transition so as to create a bright future for Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Lu noted that in recent years the
pace of Hong Kong's economic development has been slow, which he
said is "inevitable in the process of structural readjustment".
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong will see a moderate economic growth after the
readjustment, he said. "Some economists' predict that Hong Kong's
economic growth rate will be five percent this year. I think this
is possible."
</P>
<P>
With the deepening of reform and opening-up as well as rapid
economic development on the mainland, he said, Hong Kong will
definitely maintain a moderate economic development, said Lu.
</P>
<P>
"Some people worry that some other Chinese cities might take
the place of Hong Kong in future. Such worries are unnecessary,"
He said.
</P>
<P>
"As an international financial, trading and shipping center,
Hong Kong attracts foreign investors, who are, however, not merely
looking at the 1,000 sq km of land and six million people in Hong
Kong, but against the backdrop of China's mainland which has a
population of 1.2 billion," Lu said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that after Hong Kong returns to China
on July 1, 1997, its ties with the mainland will become even
closer.
</P>
<P>
Lu stressed that the Chinese government's policies toward Hong
Kong remain unchanged, as fixed in the Basic Law, and must be
strictly observed.
</P>
<P>
He voiced the hope that more Hong Kong people would become
involved in the work for the preparation of the Hong Kong SAR in
the new year, when the Preparatory Committee of Hong Kong SAR is
soon to be established.
</P>
<P>
Under the guideline of Deng Xiaoping for Hong Kong people's
involvement in its affairs during the late-transitional period,
the Preparatory Committee of the SAR has absorbed more Hong Kong
people, he said. "It is, of course, highly insufficient to only
rely on the 150 members of the Preparatory Committee to fulfil the
smooth transition of Hong Kong.'
</P>
<P>
"We expect that the six million Hong Kong people will
participate in this work to maintain Hong Kong's prosperity and
stability after July 1, 1997, thus realizing the goal of "Hong
Kong people governing Hong Kong" and "a high-degree of autonomy,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> Demand for Soybean Meal Up in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's demand for soybean
meal is expected to be 1.3 million tons despite uncertainty in the
animal-feed industry this year.
</P>
<P>
The Thai soybean oil crushing industry is likely to provide
some 500,000 tons of soybean meal and other byproducts for the
industry, and the import quota this year should be 830,000 tons,
the Thai Animal-Feed Manufacturing Association said.
</P>
<P>
The Agricultural Ministry also stated that Thailand would
import at least 800,000 tons of soybean meal this year.
</P>
<P>
Thailand reportedly has proposed to the World Trade
Organization to import a minimum of 220,800 tons of soybean meal
at 20 percent tax this year. Imports exceeding the quota for 1996,
which has not been announced, will be taxed at 119 percent.

<P>
KATHMANDU, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Prime Minister Sher
Bahadur Deuba is to visit India in the third week of February
1996, according to a local newspaper today.
</P>
<P>
Prior to that, Indian Minister for External Affairs Pranab
Mukherjee would pay a visit to Nepal by the end of this month to
prepare for Deuba's official visit to India, the Kathmandu Post
quoted a highly-placed official here as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali official said that Nepal's foreign policy approach
would see a marked shift from "discussing a little bit of
everything" to the "focus on economy."
</P>
<P>
According to him, the widening trade deficit with India and
efforts to better transit facilities for Nepal would be Nepal's
key concerns while dealing with the relations with India.
</P>
<P>
Of Nepal's total current budget deficit of nearly 630 million
US dollars, more than half comes from the trade deficit with
India, its southern neighbor.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Deuba said that soon after his visit to India he would
give a visit to Nepal's northern neighbor China.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 1 (Xinhua) -- A Senior Afghan government
official claimed a "major and basic" improvement in relations
between the Kabul government and its main rival, Uzbek militia
leader General Rashid Dostum.
</P>
<P>
Presidential spokesman Abdul Morad said in Kabul Sunday that he
and a top level delegation held friendly and productive talks with
Dostum.
</P>
<P>
A local report here, however, said Morad and the Kabul
delegation were stopped at the Mazar-i-Sharif airport and not
allowed to meet with Dostum.
</P>
<P>
"The negotiations with Dostum after two years of fighting could
be considered as very positive. He received us warmly and
negotiations were carried out in a cordial atmosphere," Morad
said.
</P>
<P>
He said both sides agreed to cooperate between each other and
pledged to resolve the conflict through understanding and
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Morad said the talks were "preparing ground" for a visit to
Dostum's headquarters Mazar-i-Sharif by Afghan President
Burhanuddin Rabbani, who made an unprecedented offer to travel to
the northern city in person for talks.
</P>
<P>
However, Morad ruled out military deal with Dostum to push back
the Taliban Islamic student militia besieging Kabul, according to
a report from Kabul.

<HEADLINE> Lu Ping on Sino-British Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 1 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese official stressed here
today that the principle of "taking ourselves as the mainstay"
should be adhered to in dealing with the issue of Hong Kong, while
not excluding co-operation with Britain based on the Sino-British
Joint Declaration.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Lu Ping, director of the Hong Kong
and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, said that during
the five years following the signing of the Sino-British Joint
Declaration in 1984, the two sides had basically good co-operation
on the Hong Kong issue.
</P>
<P>
Despite some contradictions and divergences on some specific
issues, the two countries could solve them through consultations
on the whole, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, since 1989 the British government had changed
its policies on the Hong Kong issue, "creating many obstacles to
the stable transition of Hong Kong and smooth transfer of power."
</P>
<P>
He said that the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group, an
institution to discuss matters related to the stable transition of
Hong Kong and smooth transfer of power, has come across many
difficulties due to lack of co-operation of the British side.
</P>
<P>
Lu said, "We are convinced that the lack of co-operation of the
British side on the Hong Kong issue will not only harm the smooth
transition of Hong Kong, but hurt Britain itself, as well."
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he added, "we sincerely hope to cooperate with the
British side and expect it to return to the spirit of the Joint
Declaration, which will not only benefit the smooth transition of
Hong Kong, but also conforms to the fundamental interests of
Britain itself."
</P>
<P>
Even if the British side clinged to its non-cooperative
attitude, he said, "we are confident about a smooth transition of
Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
When asked to comment on the China visit this month by Malcolm
Rifkind, Britain's secretary of state for foreign and Commonwealth
affairs, Lu said, "Since Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian
Qichen visited Britain, the British side has expressed wish to
cooperate with China on the Hong Kong issue. This is a good
sign. We welcome this move."
</P>
<P>
But he added, "We hope that this commitment will not be
restricted to words, but put into practice."
</P>
<P>
He voiced the expectation that Rifkind's coming visit will
bring new progress to Sino-British co-operation on the Hong Kong
issue.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Aims to Reduce Iodine Deficiency Sufferers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Thailand aims to reduce the
number of people suffering from iodine deficiency to 5 percent in
the new year.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that 15 million people in Thailand, or 25
percent of the population, suffer from iodine deficiency and are
at risk of suffering swelling of the neck (goiter), mental
retardation and slow mental development.
</P>
<P>
Iodine deficiency is found among the Thai population in most
northern and northeastern provinces.
</P>
<P>
Studies show that consuming iodized salt can help improve
children's school results, by as much as 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
Vegetables and meat products produced in these areas have only
one twentieth of iodine as found in the same kinds of products in
other regions in the country.
</P>
<P>
Later this month, a total of about 2,400 tons of iodized salt,
donated by the king, will be distributed to village
representatives in north and northern areas.

<HEADLINE> Lu Ping on New Year Tasks for HK Preparatory Committee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Lu Ping, director of the Hong
Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, said here
today that it is imperative to "seize every minute and second" to
prepare for resuming the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Lu called 1996 the most important
year in Hong Kong's transitional period, saying that he expected
Hong Kong residents to live in peace and its economy to boom in
the new year.
</P>
<P>
"Also, I am looking forward to new dawn appearing in
Sino-British co-operation on the issue of Hong Kong," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lu said the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) to be established later this month,
will be confronted with a lot of intensive work, including the
preparations for the establishment of the first SAR government,
and legislative and judicial bodies in accordance with the
relevant stipulations in the Basic Law and decisions made by
China's National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
First of all, he said, a committee responsible for recommending
and electing the first government for the Hong Kong SAR, which
will be composed of 400 Hong Kong people, must be set up. The
chief executive of the Hong Kong SAR and a provisional legislative
council will be recommended and elected by this committee.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the Court of Final Appeal and its subordinating
Supreme Court and courts at various levels are to be established
on July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
He said, according to suggestions raised by the former
Preliminary Working Committee (PWC) of the Preparatory Committee
of the Hong Kong SAR, the chief executive to be appointed will
emerge in the latter half of this year. The government officials
of the SAR will be chosen by him and then they will be finally
appointed by the central government.
</P>
<P>
The nomination bodies will consider how to take up the work of
the current Hong Kong government, as well as issues concerning
arrangements in every field after 1997, said Lu Ping.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that neither the bodies to be appointed or
the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong SAR will be the center
of power, nor can they exercise any power of authority over Hong
Kong before July 1, 1997. As stated clearly in the Sino-British
Joint Declaration, Hong Kong will be under Britain's
administration up till July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Lu Ping expressed the hope for co-operation on the British side
in this regard, saying he hoped to see convenience provided for
the government bodies to be appointed.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the nature of the Preparatory Committee of the
Hong Kong SAR and its functions during the transfer of power, Lu
said that the Preparatory Committee is quite different from the
PWC, which only provides suggestions and opinions for the smooth
transition of power.
</P>
<P>
The Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong SAR is a working
institution as well as a legislative body authorized by the
National People's Congress, he said, adding it will make
preparations in every field for the establishment of the SAR
government, but will never interfere in the administration of the
British Hong Kong government before July 1, 1997.

<HEADLINE> Thai Animal-Feed Industry to Consume More Fish Meal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 1 (Xinhua) -- The Thai animal-feed industry is
expected to consume 800,000 tons of fish meal this year, up 20
percent from last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the Thai Animal-Feed Manufacturing Association, as
domestic supply will not exceed 500,000 tons, Thailand needs to
import at least 300,000 tons this year, with a surcharge of 1,400
baht (56 US dollars) per ton, compared with 2,400 baht (96
dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
The lower surcharge will bring retail cost of fish meal down to
22 baht (0.88 dollars) a kilogram from 23 baht (0.92 dollars)
currently, the association said.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Promises Better Life for Poor Russians in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 1 (Xinhua) -- The Russian president has made it
his New Year resolution to give poor Russians a better life in
1996.
</P>
<P>
In a New Year address broadcast on television and radio on
New Year's Eve, Boris Yeltsin said: "The main task in 1996 is to
make every poor Russian live better."
</P>
<P>
He believes that conditions have been created to uplift the
living standards in the coming year. The fall in production was
almost halted and a success in curbing inflation was achieved in
1995, he said.
</P>
<P>
The president promised that initial steps will be taken in 1996
to return devalued savings, first to the elderly.
</P>
<P>
"We owe very much to them," Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
He warned that those officials who fail to clear wage and
pension debts in early January would be removed. "Those who are
unable to straighten things out in this field should resign before
the president prompts them."
</P>
<P>
Many Russians, who voted for the Communists in the legislative
elections last December, complained about price hikes and
declining living standards.
</P>
<P>
The president said punishment will be meted out to those
who misuse public funds allocated to social welfare purposes.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that to weed out abuses of public funds will be a
major task in the struggle against poverty.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said that though some administrators of different ranks
and directors of enterprises and banks are involved in the abuse
of public funds, they will not be left at peace next year.
</P>
<P>
"We are so strong together that we can overcome all adversities
and achieve successes," said Yeltsin, who is still to decide
whether to run for a second term.
</P>
<P>
The presidential elections are slated for the coming June.

<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, December 31 (Xinhua) -- FIFA president Joao
Havelange promised to award the 2006 World Cup to Africa, local
daily Jornal do Brasil said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
And South Africa was a top favorite to host the tournament,
said Havelange who was scheduled to tour the country for the
African Cup of Nations slated for January 13 to February 3.
</P>
<P>
"The success of African soccer could result shortly in having a
world champion, and I will tell (South African) President Nelson
Mandela on my trip that the 2006 World Cup will be on his
continent," the daily quoted Havelange as saying.
</P>
<P>
This was the latest of a series of gestures from Havelange to
Africa who supports the 79-year-old Brazilian for his re-election.
</P>
<P>
As the 1998 World Cup will field in 32 teams instead of the
original 24 squads, Africa has been alloted one quarter, doubling
its slots to five.
</P>
<P>
Africa was granted an extra third berth in the 1994 World Cup
after Cameroon entered the quarterfinals in 1990.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Speeds Up Power Industry Building </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Beijing will further speed up
its power industry building during the Ninth Five-Year Plan period
(1996-2000), mayor Li Qiyan announced at a recent meeting marking
completion of the "9511" project, which was designed to ensure the
city has enough power supply.
</P>
<P>
The project, co-sponsored by the North China Power Group, the
Beijing municipal government and the Inner-Mongolian Autonomous
Region, has added more than one million kilowatts of electricity
to the city's power supply network, since it was launched towards
the end of 1992..
</P>
<P>
With completion of the project, Beijing's total peak power load
is basically met, and since November 1 last year, local residents
no longer had to worry about power failures in their daily life.
</P>
<P>
However, the city's peak power load is expected to reach more
than 6.5 million kilowatts by the year 2000, a figure beyond
existing power capabilities.
</P>
<P>
For that, the city will undertake a series of new power
projects, including the Ming Tombs power plant, Gaobeidian thermal
power plant and Sanhe power plant in Hebei province, so as to
eliminate the need of power break-off by the end of this century,
 Li Qiyan said.

<HEADLINE> US Budget Talks to Resume Tuesday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 31 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Senate Republican and
Democratic leaders rejected each other's proposals to send about a
quarter-million federal workers back to their offices, making
about a quarter-million federal workers face a dismal New Years
Day.
</P>
<P>
Following a third straight day of White House negotiations to
achieve a balanced budget over seven years, top negotiators have
adjourned until Tuesday, and so has the Senate.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Mike McCurry said when the negotiators
resume talks they will be ready to discuss "the tradeoffs" on
Medicare, taxes, welfare and other issues needed for an agreement.
</P>
<P>
The partial shutdown of the federal government that began
December 16, has affected not only 760,000 workers in unfunded
agencies but also vacationers, veterans, mortgage applicants,
contractors and businesses near national parks and other sites.
</P>
<P>
The shutdown involves 760,000 employees, of whom 480,000 are on
the job as "emergency" workers, while 280,000 are on furlough.
Those workers will face a huge backlog of work when they return.
</P>
<P>
"So it's not going to be a happy new year," Senate Majority
Leader Bob Dole said on the Senate floor before the chamber
adjourned.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have blamed each other for the failure to reach
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Dole's latest plan includes his previous proposal to send
employees back to work with a guarantee they would be paid later.
It would limit Senate debate on a balanced budget agreement to 12
hours, plus time for voting on amendments. It also would follow
other restrictive rules in effect for budget bills.
</P>
<P>
Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle has proposed an emergency
funding bill to return furloughed workers and pay them
immediately. His latest option was to accept Dole's language on
returning the workers, providing a budget agreement protects
Medicare, education and the environment.
</P>
<P>
Dole said, "We haven't given up. We're going to come back here
again Tuesday and hopefully by then we'll have an agreement."
</P>
<P>
"I don't share the view of some of my colleagues that we ought
to have a partial shutdown of the government and that people
shouldn't be paid," he said.
