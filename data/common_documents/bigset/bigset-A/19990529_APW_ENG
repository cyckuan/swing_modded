<HEADLINE> Caravaggio Work at National Gallery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- To Christians it's one of the most dramatic  
moments of their faith, the kiss of Judas and the arrest of Jesus 
in the Garden of Gethsemane. To art lovers, it's the long ``lost'' 
depiction of that moment by one of the greatest of Italian artists, 
Michelangelo Merisi -- better known as Caravaggio. 
</P>
<P>
	For centuries labeled the work of a minor Dutch painter, ``The  
Taking of Christ,'' was identified in 1990 by Sergio Benedetti, a 
senior restorer at the National Gallery of Ireland. He found it in 
the dining room of a house of Jesuit priests in Dublin. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're almost certain that the figure in the upper right,  
holding a lantern, is a self-portrait of Caravaggio,'' Benedetti 
told reporters at the painting's first appearance in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Gallery of Art has no Caravaggio -- only about 35 of  
his paintings survive. Its exhibit opening Sunday surrounds this 
one with eight Italian, French and Spanish paintings that relate to 
Caravaggio's distinctive style. 
</P>
<P>
	Caravaggio brings the viewer into the picture by crowding his  
realistic, vividly colored figures close together and painting 
light and dark areas in dramatic contrast. Illumination seems to 
come from above, as if from heaven. But the lantern, held by the 
figure who is apparently Caravaggio, serves mostly to light up his 
own partly hidden face. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Taking of Christ'' was painted in 1602 for the wealthy  
Mattei family of Rome. Caravaggio had a bad reputation there and 
fled after killing a man in a brawl about a tennis match. He died 
at 39. 
</P>
<P>
	The Matteis fell on hard times and 200 years later they sold  
some of their paintings to William Hamilton Nesbit, a rich Scotsman 
who often visited Italy. He labeled it ``The Betrayal of Christ,'' 
by Gerard van Honthorst, a follower of Caravaggio who had some 
reputation of his own. It was in the family for more than a 
century. 
</P>
<P>
	After that family died out, an auction house in Edinburgh,  
Scotland, tried to sell six of its pictures -- including the 
Caravaggio -- but withdrew them when the lot failed to reach the 
paintings' asking price of about $250. 
</P>
<P>
	The Caravaggio has been valued recently at more than $30  
million. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Noel Barber, superior of the Jesuit residence that owns  
the painting, told reporters it was acquired by the widow of a 
British police inspector who gave it to the Jesuits because one of 
them helped her in her grief after her husband was killed. 
</P>
<P>
	It hung in the community's house for the next 30 years, until  
Barber got the National Gallery of Ireland to restore it as a work 
of van Honthorst. Benedetti recognized it as a Caravaggio almost at 
once, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The painting has been on exhibit at the Irish gallery, and until  
May 24 at the McMullen Museum of Art at Boston University. ``The 
Taking of Christ'' will be at the National Gallery until July 18.

<HEADLINE> Socialite Dad Admits Kidnapping Kin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- It took a prosecutor, a courthouse and a  
judge to bring the Fagan family together again. 
</P>
<P>
	But they seemed as far apart Friday as they have been for the  
last 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephen Fagan admitted that he had kidnapped his daughters --  
then ages 5 and 2 -- in 1979, told them their mother had died in a 
car crash and fabricated new lives for them in Florida. He claimed 
ex-wife Barbara Kurth was an alcoholic and an unfit parent. 
</P>
<P>
	Fagan, 57, pleaded guilty Friday to kidnapping and was let off  
with five years of probation and a $100,000 fine. He could have 
gotten 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The daughters, now 25 and 22, have stood by their father even  
after they learned last year that their mother was alive and that 
their names had been changed. They have refused to meet with their 
mother. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want the court to know that if we could retroactively give  
our father the consent needed to take the action he did 20 years 
ago, we would, without hesitation,'' said the elder daughter, 
Rachael Martin. 
</P>
<P>
	In the courtroom, the young women hardly cast a glance at Ms.  
Kurth, now a cellular biologist living in Virginia. She was 
divorced from Fagan in 1978. She has denied she was unfit and said 
she was suffering from narcolepsy, an illness that causes sudden, 
deep sleep. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some days I believe that Stephen Fagan would have been kinder  
to really have murdered me rather than having done so only in the 
minds of my children -- at least then there would have been no 
question as to his punishment,'' Ms. Kurth, 49, said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Fagan claimed his ex-wife, who has since remarried, was a  
neglectful mother and an alcoholic, and that he needed to rescue 
his daughters. At the time, he said, courts didn't look kindly on a 
father seeking custody. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was raised in a home where the best interests of the  
children always came first. They still do,'' Fagan said outside 
court. ``This has always been about Rachael and Lisa, for me. 
Nothing and no one else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fagan's lawyer, Richard Egbert, told the court that Fagan hadn't  
kidnapped the girls without sacrifice, detailing how he left his 
job, his family and his life in Massachusetts with only ``a 
suitcase and a stack of diapers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The former lawyer was living under the name Dr. William Martin  
when he was arrested in his Palm Beach, Fla., mansion last year. 
Authorities caught up with him after Massachusetts state police got 
a tip. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time he was arrested, Fagan had married a prosperous land  
developer and was driving expensive cars and was a member of some 
of the most exclusive clubs in Palm Beach. He had invented a past 
that included a stint as a presidential adviser, chemist and CIA 
agent. 
</P>
<P>
	He admitted on the stand Friday that he hasn't held a job since  
he left Massachusetts, where he was a supervisor at the Harvard Law 
School legal aid bureau. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the probation, Fagan was ordered to perform 2,000  
hours of community service in a Florida veterans hospital and pay 
$100,000 to a Boston children's charity selected by Ms. Kurth. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been a tragic, difficult and wrenching case for  
everyone who has been victimized by Mr. Fagan's unlawful conduct,'' 
Judge Peter Lauriat said. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference, the daughters said their father did not  
dupe them and said any reconciliation with their mother would be 
private. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're clearly not brainwashed,'' Rachael Martin said. ``We've  
been raised and live our lives as independent women.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Kurth's brother, Peter Kurth, said he and his sister feel  
pity for her daughters. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are pathetically deluded and they are going to pay for it  
the rest of their lives,'' he said. ``We wish them well. They're 
going to need it.''

<P>
	SANTA CRUZ, Calif. (AP) -- Sara Boutelle, an architectural  
historian who rediscovered the work of the woman who designed 
William Randolph Hearst's California castle, died Wednesday. She 
was 90. 
</P>
<P>
	Until Ms. Boutelle published ``Julia Morgan, Architect'' in  
1988, little was known about Morgan beyond her work on Hearst's 
spectacular castle, San Simeon. 
</P>
<P>
	Her book revealed that Morgan designed nearly 800 buildings, a  
legacy rivaling that of Frank Lloyd Wright. Her accomplishment also 
came at a time when women were rarely able to enter the profession. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Boutelle discovered that Morgan had worked alone and  
destroyed most of her blueprints shortly before her death in 1957. 
She reconstructed Morgan's designs from the scattered records of 
her former clients. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1991, Ms. Boutelle was made an honorary member of the  
American Institute of Architects, the highest award the 
organization gives to someone who is not an architect. 

</P>

 *Frank Gunther    	
</P>
<P>
	VENICE, Fla. (AP) -- Frank Gunther, who devised some of the first  
radio communications devices, died Monday. He was 91. 
</P>
<P>
	Gunther helped create shortwave, two-way and FM systems, often  
working with the military and police and fire departments. In 1932 
he built what is believed to be the first two-way mobile police 
radio system for the Bayonne, N.J., police department. 
</P>
<P>
	Gunther also installed one of the first one-way radios used on  
an aircraft. In 1931, he took part in the first public broadcast 
from an aircraft. A year later he installed the first two-way radio 
system on an airplane. 
</P>
<P>
	He joined Radio Engineering Laboratories in 1925. It was there  
that he constructed and operated an experimental station that was 
one of the first shortwave broadcasting systems. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1935, Gunther and Edwin Armstrong gave the first public  
demonstration of frequency modulation, or FM transmission. The 
signal was much superior in clarity to AM or shortwave. 

</P>

<P>
	OAK BROOK, Ill. (AP) -- Charles F. McErlean Sr., former president  
of UAL Inc., the parent company of United Airlines, died May 21. He 
was 87. 
</P>
<P>
	With a law degree and a background with the National Labor  
Relations Board, McErlean was hired in 1945 by W.A. Patterson, 
founder of United Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	He started the company's legal department and held several jobs  
over the next few decades, including vice president, senior vice 
president and was a member of the company's board of directors. He 
rose to United vice chairman and UAL president. 
</P>
<P>
	McErlean was considered a strong administrator who played an  
active role in labor negotiations over the years.

</P>
<P>
	MACON, Ga. (AP) -- Richard Ray, a former representative known for  
his advocacy for veterans and the military bases in his west 
Georgia district, died Saturday from complications related to 
emergency heart valve replacement surgery last week. He was 72. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray was elected to Congress in 1982 after serving 10 years as an  
aide to former Georgia Sen. Sam Nunn. He was defeated in 1992 and 
started a consulting firm in Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	In Congress, Ray often found himself at odds with fellow  
Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1983, Ray irritated the Democratic House leadership when he  
was one of only six Democrats to vote against the party's budget 
proposal. He also opposed a resolution calling for a nuclear freeze 
and voted against the Equal Rights Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray angered many blacks when he opposed designating Martin  
Luther King Jr.'s birthday as a federal holiday, saying the country 
couldn't afford it.

<HEADLINE> Columbus 2, Los Angeles 1 (SO) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Jeff Cunningham scored in the 88th minute  
to tie the game and scored the winning goal in the shootout round 
as the Columbus Crew beat the Los Angeles Galaxy 2-1 in a Major 
League Soccer game tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	Crew goalkeeper Mark Dougherty stopped consecutive shots by Cobi  
Jones, Welton and Mauricio Cienfuegoes in the shootout round. With 
the win, Dougherty tied the MLS all-time record of 42 wins set by 
Dallas' Mark Dodd. 
</P>
<P>
	Billy Thompson and Stern John also scored for the Crew in the  
shootout round against Galaxy goalkeeper Kevin Hartman. Thompson 
flicked a shot over the head of the onrushing Hartman, and 
Cunningham and John dribbled around the league's best goalkeeper to 
score. 
</P>
<P>
	After stopping several point-blank shots by John, Hartman was on  
his way to his sixth shutout of the year. But Cunningham took a 
pass from Matt Kmosko inside the box, dribbled around a defender 
and fired a hard shot past Hartman for his fourth goal of the year. 
The goal was only the seventh Hartman has allowed all season. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones put Los Angeles up 1-0 in the 57th minute on a goal from  
18 yards out. That was after Crew defender Mike Clark headed his 
first shot back to him. Jones collected the ball and sent the shot 
past Dougherty for his second goal of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	The goal was the first the Crew had allowed in a team-record of  
290 minutes of regulation play. 
</P>
<P>
	The Galaxy outshot the Crew 15-to-9 but the Crew led 4-to-2 in  
shots on goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the shootout win, Columbus (7-3) falls to second place  
in the Eastern Conference because Washington D.C. won Saturday in 
regulation. The Galaxy (5-6) remain in fourth place in the Western 
Conference.

<HEADLINE> Man Convicted of Killing Prosecutor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A reputed gang leader was convicted Saturday in  
the execution-style slaying of a gang prosecutor who had dogged him 
for over a year. 
</P>
<P>
	After nearly three days of deliberations, jurors found  
24-year-old Jeffrey Bly guilty of the 1995 shooting of Assistant 
Attorney General Paul McLaughlin outside a commuter rail station in 
the city's West Roxbury section. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Bly executed McLaughlin, 42, because he feared  
going to jail on carjacking charges. He was subsequently convicted 
on those charges and is currently serving a 10- to 15-year sentence 
in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
	McLaughlin's 78-year-old father, former Lt. Gov. Edward F.  
McLaughlin Jr., told the court that though Bly's actions were 
``vicious and cowardly,'' the family has chosen to focus instead on 
the life and accomplishments of his son. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even though Jeffrey Bly pulled the trigger to extinguish  
(Paul's) life, he didn't -- nor could he ever -- extinguish his 
memory,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bly was sentenced to life imprisonment with no chance of parole  
for McLaughlin's death, the automatic penalty for a first-degree 
murder conviction in Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
	Using eyewitnesses, DNA evidence, and the word of Bly's  
acquaintances, prosecutors spun a web that tied Bly to the killing. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyers assailed the credibility of witnesses, denounced  
physical evidence as junk science, and said Bly was nowhere near 
McLaughlin at the time of the killing. 
</P>
<P>
	In the eight months prior to his death Sept. 25, 1995,  
McLaughlin had unsuccessfully tried Bly twice. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Bly, leader of the Theodore Street Posse in  
Boston's Mattapan neighborhood, had a vendetta against the lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecution witnesses testified that Bly bragged of taking out  
the prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have to worry about the DA no more,'' Janet Brown said  
Bly told her. ``I shot him two or three times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anthony Houston testified that Bly ordered him to stalk  
McLaughlin three days before the shooting and make note of the 
prosecutor's routine. He said he wrote down McLaughlin's license 
plate number for Bly. 
</P>
<P>
	DNA evidence recovered from bloodstained gloves, a sweatshirt  
and hat dumped along railroad tracks, tied Bly to the crime, 
prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	A fragment of McLaughlin's eyeglasses was found on the glove,  
and prosecutors said authorities recovered Bly's genetic material 
from the clothing.

<HEADLINE> Vitter Wins Louisiana Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Former state Rep. David Vitter was elected  
Saturday to succeed Bob Livingston in Congress, winning a close 
election over former Gov. Dave Treen. 
</P>
<P>
	With all precincts reporting, unofficial returns showed Vitter  
with 61,661 or 51 percent, to Treen's 59,849 or 49 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The two solidly conservative Republican lawyers, both veteran  
politicians, struggled to point out their differences after 
finishing atop a field of nine in a May 1 primary. 
</P>
<P>
	Perennial candidate and ex-Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke  
finished third in that race. 
</P>
<P>
	Treen lost despite endorsements from Livingston, Gov. Mike  
Foster and several powerful politicians. Vitter shrugged off the 
endorsements from ``the powers that be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They may have been the past, but we are the future,'' Vitter  
said to wild cheers from his supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Treen ran as a well-connected insider with built-in seniority  
and valuable contacts owing to the seven years he served in 
Congress before being elected governor in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	Vitter, 38, hoped to use youth to his advantage, saying the  
70-year-old Treen's influence would be diminished because of his 
age. 
</P>
<P>
	Influence was the issue because Livingston, in a 20-year  
congressional career, proved adept at steering federal money to the 
home district, snagging federal funds for flood control projects 
and steering defense contracts to shipyards. 
</P>
<P>
	Livingston was chairman of the Appropriations Committee and in  
line to be speaker last year when he learned, as House members 
moved toward impeaching President Clinton, that news of his past 
marital infidelities was about to break. He confessed and resigned, 
urging Clinton to follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
	The runoff campaign was interrupted in its final week when  
Treen's 20-year-old grandson disappeared during a hike in the 
Oregon wilderness. He was found safe on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The final days of the campaign then got nasty. The candidates  
were in attack mode Friday evening during a debate on WWL-AM radio. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke was an issue at times. Treen denounced Vitter for putting  
out campaign mailers saying Duke supported the former governor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did put it out and it's true but I'm tired of having my  
integrity bashed by you. You're trying to have it both ways,'' 
Vitter responded. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke has not endorsed anyone but said he would vote for Treen  
over Vitter. 
</P>
<P>
	Some small position differences emerged between the two  
candidates during the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Vitter denounced all forms of gun control. Treen said he defends  
the right to bear arms but is not opposed to some restrictions on 
more sophisticated weapons automatic or semiautomatic weapons. And 
he said gun dealers at gun shows should be subjected to the same 
background check requirements as regular gun retailers. 
</P>
<P>
	Both said they opposed affirmative action but Treen also said he  
was against the federal government banning colleges and 
universities from deciding their own racial admission policies.

<HEADLINE> MCI WorldCom Buying SkyTel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Days after MCI WorldCom Inc. shot down rumors it  
was planning to buy pager company Skytel Communications Inc., it 
did just that, announcing a $1.3 billion stock acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's No. 2 long-distance phone company will pay stock  
worth $21.24 for each share of SkyTel, filling a gaping wireless 
hole in an otherwise broad list of telecommunications businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom, a major owner of the circuitry that makes up the  
Internet, will also absorb about $525 million in debt from SkyTel, 
which is one of the few profitable companies in the paging 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, shares of SkyTel shot higher after an Internet  
service named Company Sleuth reported that MCI WorldCom had 
reserved the Web site domain name ``skytelworldcom.com.'' 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom quickly played down the significance of that move,  
saying it routinely reserves domain names that might have value, 
and that the registration for the SkyTel-related name was the work 
of an overzealous employee. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement announced Friday comes amid a frenzy of  
deal-making that's reshaping the communications industry, with 
phone companies like Bell Atlantic and GTE merging and AT&AMP;T 
spending about $100 billion on cable TV properties it plans to use 
for phone calls and Internet access. 
</P>
<P>
	For MCI WorldCom, the SkyTel deal comes after two failed  
attempts to buy its way into the $33 billion wireless 
communications industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Just weeks ago, talks to acquire Nextel Communications, the  
largest independent wireless company, unraveled after the companies 
failed to agree on price. In January, MCI WorldCom dropped out of a 
bidding war to buy AirTouch Communications. 
</P>
<P>
	``We see a lot of opportunity for growth in the overall wireless  
market, and over time, we expect to be a broader participant in 
that market,'' said Frank Walter, a spokesman for MCI WorldCom. 
</P>
<P>
	SkyTel and MCI WorldCom, both based in Mississippi, have  
long-standing business ties. MCI WorldCom is the largest reseller 
of the SkyTel's messaging services. 
</P>
<P>
	SkyTel, with about 1.6 million customers, has been a leader in  
the move toward two-way pagers that enable customers to exchange 
messages directly with other pagers or via the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, expected to be completed in six to nine months, was  
announced after the close of financial markets Friday. Shares of 
SkyTel rose $1 to $20.31 1/4, while shares of MCI WorldCom rose $1.43 3/4 
a share to $86.37 1/2, both on the Nasdaq Stock Market.

<HEADLINE> Male Guard Wins Sex Harassment Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOUNT HOLLY, N.J. (AP) -- A male prison guard who sued after a  
female co-worker repeatedly tried to seduce him has won a $3.75 
million sexual harassment award. 
</P>
<P>
	A jury found Friday that New Jersey corrections officials did  
nothing to stop the harassment of Robert Lockley Jr., even after he 
complained to supervisors at the Mid-State Correctional Facility at 
Fort Dix. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel also determined that Lockley's co-workers and  
supervisors retaliated against him after he reported the 
harassment. 
</P>
<P>
	He was awarded $3 million in punitive damages and $750,000 in  
compensatory damages. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a big win,'' said Lockley, 39, of Willingboro.  
</P>
<P>
	Lockley sued in 1994 alleging Ronda Turner, 37, began harassing  
him in 1990. He said she called him up to invite him to her home, 
but he declined, saying he was married and not interested. Turner 
then began following him around the prison grounds, repeatedly 
asking him to go out with her or have sex, according to the 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not the common and usual situation,'' said Marcia  
Greenberger, co-president of the National Women's Law Center, which 
won a case before the Supreme Court last week involving sexual 
harassment in public schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Rita Malley, spokeswoman for the state attorney general, said  
the state plans to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockley still works at Mid-State with Turner and other  
co-workers accused of retaliating. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's refused to go to lunch because he hasn't wanted to deal  
with them,'' said his attorney, Linda Wong. ``He goes to his tower 
and eats his lunch there.''

<HEADLINE> Lowell Joins Marlins After Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Testicular cancer gave Florida Marlins rookie third  
baseman Mike Lowell a scare, a new perspective and an extra reason 
to savor his National League debut. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than 24 hours after being recalled from Triple-A, Lowell  
was in the lineup for Saturday night's game against the Cincinnati 
Reds. He went 0-for-4 with two strikeouts and an error in the 
Marlins' 8-1 loss. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowell's season was sidetracked by surgery Feb. 21 to remove a  
small testicular mass found during a routine physical examination. 
</P>
<P>
	``From a life perspective, things have been put in their place  
because of this,'' Lowell said before the game. ``From a baseball 
standpoint, I don't think my attitude has changed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not one to be complacent. I'm going to be aggressive on  
the field. This is kind of like survival of the fittest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lowell, who grew up in Miami, hit 56 homers in 1997-98 in the  
New York Yankees' farm system, then was traded Feb. 1 to Florida 
for three pitching prospects. He hopes to bolster an offense that 
ranks next-to-last in the major leagues in runs, but he admits that 
surgery has temporarily robbed him of the power he had last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can play every day. From that standpoint, I'm 100 percent,''  
said Lowell, 25. ``Strength-wise, I don't know if I'm going to be 
100 percent the whole year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Triple-A Calgary, Lowell hit .313 with two homers and nine  
RBIs in 83 at-bats. His rehabilitation was complicated by soreness 
in his throwing shoulder that has since subsided. 
</P>
<P>
	Following surgery, Lowell underwent a short course of low-dose  
radiation, and he said his prognosis is excellent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Health-wise everything has been best-case scenario,'' he said.  
``I can't complain. Things could have been worse. I'm just happy to 
be on the field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Marlins' third baseman for most of the season, Kevin Orie,  
went on the disabled list Friday with a pulled groin. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowell emerged as a top prospect last year, when he hit .304 at  
Triple-A Columbus with 26 homers and 99 RBIs. He believes he's 
ready for the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is what I've wanted to do, so you can't shy away from  
it,'' he said. ``You have to have confidence in yourself.''

<HEADLINE> Mississippi Flag Suit Fuels Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- The state Supreme Court's decision to  
reinstate a lawsuit against Mississippi's use of the Confederate 
battle flag in the state banner has refueled fiery rhetoric over 
the divisive symbol. 
</P>
<P>
	Tucked in a corner of Mississippi's state banner, the stars and  
bars is an anchor for some proud Southerners, but a painful 
reminder of a segregationist history for others. 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court on Thursday reinstated a lawsuit filed by the  
NAACP and dozens of black Mississippians that challenges the 
continued use of the Confederate symbol. 
</P>
<P>
	``Outside the state they think we're still fighting the Civil  
War,'' Bennie Turner, a black leader in the state Senate, said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jim Giles, the outspoken head of a group that promotes  
Southern heritage and champions the Confederate flag, says the flag 
has nothing to do with racism. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a visceral, emotional feeling of pride,'' said Giles,  
head of the Southern Initiative. ``We all descend from a group of 
people who fought under that flag.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He believes flag opponents are agitators and has a two-word  
message for them: ``get out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There ain't no fences around Mississippi, they can go  
somewhere else,'' said Giles, an independent candidate for 
governor. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People  
filed the original suit six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they have an uphill battle,'' said Mike Barefield,  
attorney for United Sons of Confederate Veterans. ``This has been 
decided in a number of courts already and every time it's 
dismissed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a different case last fall, the state Supreme Court refused  
to ban use of a Confederate flag on the Gulf Coast as part of a 
historical flag display. 
</P>
<P>
	But in the ruling, Justice Fred Banks said the flag ``has been  
used throughout history, not only to commemorate the sacrifices 
made in support of the Confederacy, but -- most importantly -- as a 
symbol of white supremacy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The banner has a condensed version of the Confederate flag in  
the upper left hand corner, with red, white and blue stripes 
covering the remainder of the flag. Its design was recommended by a 
special committee to the Legislature in 1894. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very offensive. It conjures up all the emotions that the  
swastika conjures up for Jewish people,'' said Ed Blackmon, a state 
representative and one of the plaintiffs in the suit.

<HEADLINE> Radio Host Sues Former Guests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Syndicated radio talk show host Art Bell is  
suing two former guests, accusing them of making slanderous 
statements on the air and causing his listenership to decline. 
</P>
<P>
	The $60 million lawsuit, filed Thursday in Los Angeles Superior  
Court, claims the men knowingly made false statements, such as Bell 
had been jailed for trafficking in pornography. Bell said he has 
never been arrested for any crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Stephens, of St. Ignatius, Mont., appeared on a radio  
show hosted by David John Oates, of Colorado, on April 3 and the 
two conspired to damage Bell's reputation, according to the 
lawsuit. A recording of the show is also available on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit claims Bell has had to reduce his time on the air  
``to respond to false and defamatory statements and deal with the 
emotional distress those statements have caused him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Associated Press was unable to locate Oates and Stephens for  
comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell hosts ``Coast to Coast AM with Art Bell,'' the nation's  
most listened-to overnight show. In October, Bell abruptly signed 
off citing a ``threatening terrible event'' involving his family, 
only to return just as suddenly about two weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell's lawyer in Los Angeles, Gerard Fox, said his client was  
seeking to protect his reputation. 
</P>
<P>
	``He also does not believe that the idea of accountability and  
free speech are mutually exclusive,'' Fox said.

<HEADLINE> Behrens Wins Massachusetts Handicap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Behrens made a powerful move coming off the final  
turn and beat Running Stag by a half length to win the $600,000 
Grade II Massachusetts Handicap at Suffolk Downs on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Real Quiet, winner of the 1998 Kentucky Derby and Preakness  
Stakes, was second at the half-mile pole but gave way in the 
stretch and finished third as the 4-5 favorite. 
</P>
<P>
	The remainder of the field in the 60th running of the 1 1/8-mile  
race in their order of finish were Brushing Up, Galloping Gael, and 
Personal Moon. 
</P>
<P>
	By winning $400,000 in a time of 1:49.14, Behrens took a 28-20  
lead over both Free House and Puerto Madero in the NTRA Champions 
Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Behrens, the second favorite, paid $3.80, $3.20 and $2.20.  
Running Stag paid $5.40 and $2.20, while Real Quiet returned $2.20. 
</P>
<P>
	Running Stag took the lead at the start and stayed in front to  
mid-stretch where he drifted and was caught by Behrens. 
</P>
<P>
	``We definitely didn't expect Running Stag to go to the lead,''  
Behrens trainer H. James Bond said. ``We thought Real Quiet was the 
horse to beat and we kept an eye on him the whole time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Mitchell, trainer of Running Stag, conceded that he  
employed a different stategy for the MassCap. 
</P>
<P>
	``We changed tactics in this race and it worked beautifully,''  
Mitchell said. ``I think we might have a horse that likes to run on 
the front end now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Real Quiet was the first Kentucky Derby winner to run in the  
MassCap since Riva Ridge won the race in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
	``Running Stag had acted like he might have wanted the lead.  
There was really no pace in the race,'' Real Quiet jockey Gary 
Stevens said. ``We picked up the other two (Running Stag and 
Behrens) about four and a half furlongs out. As soon as I started 
putting him down, he started to tire.''

<HEADLINE> Avalanche-Stars Creating Rivalry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Before the Western Conference finals, the Dallas  
Stars and Colorado Avalanche had never met in the postseason, not 
even when they were the Minnesota North Stars and the Quebec 
Nordiques. 
</P>
<P>
	It hasn't taken long to start a rivalry.  
</P>
<P>
	Four exciting, intense games between top-seeded Dallas and  
second-seeded Colorado have stirred strong emotions towards one 
another. The series is tied after four games with Game 5 tomorrow 
at Reunion Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we came in with respect and fear. The fear is pretty  
well gone and that's been replaced by hate,'' Stars coach Ken 
Hitchcock said Saturday. ``That's good. It makes for healthy 
play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It also makes for physical play, and the rough stuff has  
escalated with each game between defensive-minded Dallas and 
offensive-oriented Colorado. Bodies were flying throughout 
Colorado's 3-2 overtime victory Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whenever you play a team in the playoffs, you get that fire  
between the two teams,'' Avalanche forward Adam Deadmarsh said. 
``You definitely can say the fire is lit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado coach Bob Hartley was still fuming Saturday afternoon  
about two blows from Dallas defenseman Richard Matvichuk. 
</P>
<P>
	The first smack broke the collarbone of Avalanche rookie Milan  
Hejduk, ending a postseason in which he'd had six goals and six 
assists. Peter Forsberg was shaken up by the second one, but he 
returned and will play Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a very borderline hit on Hejduk. And the one against  
Forsberg, that is clearly checking from behind,'' Hartley said. 
``You can see it clearly on the video. He is going right for him 
like he is under a mission.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Matvichuk hurt his groin after hitting Forsberg, but Hitchcock  
said he'll be back Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hartley said Game 1 hero Valeri Kamensky, who missed Game 4 with  
a wrist injury, could be back Sunday. Hartley said a decision would 
be made at game time. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas went into Game 4 knowing that a victory would give it a  
chance to eliminate Colorado on Sunday. But the Avalanche scored on 
their first two shots, putting the Stars in a survival mode. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas scored goals in the second and third periods, but  
Colorado won on a goal by rookie Chris Drury with 31 seconds left 
in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	Hitchcock said it was a quiet flight back to Dallas, which  
worried him going into a team meeting Saturday. He came out 
smiling, though, as his players were upbeat. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know this is a funny thing to say, but I think our players  
are enjoying the moment so much right now that they're willing to 
do anything -- ANYTHING -- to win,'' Hitchcock said. ``There's a 
point you reach as a team where you enjoy paying the price. That's 
where we're at and it looks like that's where they're at, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both teams understand what has to be done now that the series  
has been reduced to best-of-3. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado was tied after four games in its first two rounds and  
won both times in six games. Dallas was in the same situation in 
the second round. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no time to waste,'' Hartley said. ``There will be no  
waste of energy at the wrong spots. I think our priorities are real 
clear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hitchcock said whichever team can dictate the style of play will  
win the series. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both goaltenders are playing outstanding and there's a lot of  
passion on both sides,'' he said. ``Both teams are playing with 
desperation and recognizing that certain aspects during every game 
can deliver a knockout punch. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that's the way it should be when you've got two real  
heavyweight teams going at it the way they're going at it right 
now.''

<HEADLINE> Father Returns To Claim Bodies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Carlos Urgiles was weary and red-eyed after  
arriving from Ecuador to claim the bodies of his estranged wife and 
four children killed by a train in Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to bring the bodies to my country. I don't want  
problems with my family,'' Urgiles said Friday at Kennedy 
International Airport, speaking through an interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
	Three days earlier, Julia Toledo, 47, and her four young boys  
were hit by an Amtrak train while crossing the tracks in Fairfield, 
Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	Urgiles said he left his family behind in the United States more  
than a year ago after fighting over religious differences with his 
sister-in-law. The families shared an apartment in Bridgeport, 
Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	Urgiles is Catholic and his sister-in-law is Mormon. His wife,  
who filed for divorce after her husband returned to Ecuador, 
attended both churches. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did not abandon my family,'' he said, adding that he also  
returned to Ecuador because he could not find a job and his mother 
was terminally ill. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mormon Church in Trumbull, Conn., made arrangements to hold  
a funeral service Monday and bury the family in nearby Easton. 
Funeral director Edgar Rodriguez of Funeraria Luz de Paz in 
Bridgeport said he was unaware of the father's plans and said he 
expected no change in the Connecticut services. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities still don't know why the family was walking along  
the train tracks before dawn on Tuesday. Asked what he thought 
might have led to his wife's accident, Urgiles said simply: ``I 
don't want to talk about it because it is too late. I'm 
destroyed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 52-year-old farm worker lives in the mountain village of  
Cojitambo, 160 miles southwest of Quito, Ecuador. He was found in 
the village by local reporters after a long search of the area. 
</P>
<P>
	In Ecuador, a poor South American nation of 12 million  
inhabitants, the family's plight has been front page news, with 
people lamenting that Ecuadoreans are forced by their country's 
poverty to go abroad to find work. 
</P>
<P>
	The state airline Ecuatoriana offered to fly Urgiles to the  
United States and bring the bodies back to Ecuador.

from last on the turn and wore down Buff in the final strides to 
capture the $112,600 Louisville Handicap by a nose today at 
Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
	Chorwon, the 6-year-old gelded son of Cozzene, has won the race  
three years in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	Chorwon covered the 1 3/8 miles in 2:14 and paid $4.40, $2.80 and  
$2.40 as the 6-5 favorite. Buff, ridden by Francisco Torres, took 
the lead at the top of the stretch before giving way and paid $4.60 
and $4. Keats and Yeats, a 20-1 outsider with Brian Peck aboard, 
finished another 1 1/4 lengths back in third and paid $5. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE>  Injuries Hit Stars and Avalanche </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- A series of injuries struck the Dallas Stars and  
the Colorado Avalanche in Game 4 of their Western Conference final 
series Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The Avalanche scratched left wing Valeri Kamensky, who sprained  
his right wrist in Game 3, and then lost right wing Milan Hejduk to 
a broken collar bone midway through the first period. 
</P>
<P>
	Hejduk, a strong rookie of the year candidate, was taken from  
McNichols Arena in an ambulance after being checked hard into the 
boards by Dallas defenseman Richard Matvichuk. A team spokesman 
said after the game that Hejduk would be out for the rest of the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Hejduk has six goals and five assists in the playoffs.  
</P>
<P>
	Dallas forward Guy Carbonneau left the game late in the second  
period after his right leg got caught under the skate of Colorado's 
Dale Hunter. Carbonneau writhed on the ice before walking off on 
his own power and returned for the third period. 
</P>
<P>
	Kamensky sparked the Avalanche in the second round as they won  
four straight against Detroit after his return from a broken right 
forearm. 
</P>
<P>
	Injuries continued in the third period before Colorado won 3-2  
in overtime. Matvichuk was forced to leave the game with an 
apparent leg injury after a pileup at the boards with Colorado 
center Peter Forsberg, who was shaken up on the play. 
</P>
<P>
	Matvichuk returned for overtime.

<HEADLINE> Fox Agrees With Affiliates on Ads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Fox Broadcasting Co. has reached an agreement  
with its affiliates under which the network will take back 20 
commercial spots each week that the stations had been allowed to 
sell themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	The affiliates had protested the network's original plan,  
revealed in early April, to cut the amount of 30-second spots that 
each local station can sell during prime time every week from 90 to 
70. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a slightly revised plan announced late Thursday, the  
network promised not to take back any more spots during prime time 
or National Football League games for the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
	The move will mean less revenues for the 200 Fox-affiliated TV  
stations around the nation and more for the network. The amount of 
money involved is hard to judge since ad rates vary widely from 
program to program, but published reports have estimated that Fox 
could gain as much as $200 million in revenues each year by the 
moves. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox's plan, which caused controversy in the broadcasting  
community, reflects increasing pressure on networks to meet the 
rising costs of buying hot prime-time shows like ``ER'' and premium 
sports programming like NFL games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fox network is controlled by Fox Entertainment Group, which  
went public last fall in a massive IPO that raised $2.8 billion. 
News Corp. still holds about 80 percent of Fox Entertainment Group, 
which also includes the Twentieth Century Fox movie studios.

<HEADLINE> Portland's Wallace Carries Load </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Rasheed Wallace carried the offensive load  
for Portland today. 
</P>
<P>
	So the Trail Blazers had no reservations about getting the ball  
to Wallace with six seconds left and a chance to tie the San 
Antonio Spurs in Game 1 of the Western Conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Wallace's shot, a 20-foot open jumper, bounced off the rim and  
over the backboard. Mario Elie then made two free throws for San 
Antonio as the Spurs won 80-76. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rasheed is as talented a basketball player as there is in the  
NBA. Any time we can get him an uncontested, open jump shot, we're 
going to live with that,'' said Portland guard Greg Anthony, who 
made the pass for the shot. ``That's not what lost us the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Turnovers, and the Twin Towers attack of David Robinson and Tim  
Duncan, were the true obstacles for the Blazers. 
</P>
<P>
	Wallace scored a career playoff-high 28 points on 12-for-20  
shooting and showed the threat he's likely to pose to the 
top-seeded Spurs in the rest of the best-of-7 playoff series. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody likes losing, but everyone can't win,'' said Wallace,  
whose team faced the Spurs less than 48 hours after eliminating the 
Utah Jazz in physical conference semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs, on the other hand, had been resting six days since  
sweeping the Los Angeles Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	The potential game-tying shot initially seemed as though it was  
a good one, Wallace said. 
</P>
<P>
	``For a split second I was wide open. ... Unfortunately, it came  
up short,'' he said, adding that he hadn't been thinking about 
stepping back and trying a 3-pointer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just go for the two and go into overtime,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Duncan and Robinson guarded Wallace at different points in the  
game. Robinson, assigned to Wallace late in the game, switched to 
help out on Anthony as he drove. Anthony kicked it back to Wallace 
with six seconds to go. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had a pretty decent look at it, but I was running at him.  
And it makes it pretty tough when someone's running at you,'' 
Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-11 Wallace seems to relish the opportunity to go  
head-to-head with 7-footers Duncan and Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
	``Timmy and I go way back to college days,'' said Wallace, who  
played in the Atlantic Coast Conference against Duncan. ``We both 
were watching David then.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before Saturday's game, Wallace had averaged 12.6 points in the  
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Isaiah Rider and Brian Grant had been averaging 19.6 and 15.3  
points, respectively, for Portland in the playoffs. But the Spurs 
held Rider to 13 points and Grant scored eight. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Rasheed was the one that was going tonight,'' Rider  
said. ``He's the one who deserved to take that shot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grant said the rest of the Trail Blazers need to improve their  
offensive production for Monday night's Game 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of us have to pick our games up, myself included, to help  
Rasheed,'' Grant said. ``We got a lot of opportunities that we 
didn't convert on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While fatigue may not have hurt the Blazers much, turnovers did.  
</P>
<P>
	``We turned the ball over a little more than they did, 13-7,''  
Portland coach Mike Dunleavy said. ``So we lost a little bit that 
way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It killed us,'' Wallace agreed. ``That could have meant an  
extra couple of possessions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our turn will come,'' Wallace added. ``Our turn will come.''

	Quest for Kosovo Peace Eludes Envoys  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- European leaders struggled to revive  
their quest for a diplomatic way out of the Kosovo crisis today, 
but common ground remained elusive as NATO renewed its pledge to 
pound away at Yugoslavia until the alliance's terms for peace are 
met. NATO said it had hit hard at Serb forces in Kosovo during the 
previous 24 hours, attacking tanks and artillery pieces, as well as 
airfields and other targets across Yugoslavia. Local media reported 
that six people were killed today. Serbian media reported more 
civilian casualties, including two deaths in the village of 
Cumurjila outside Nis in central Serbia.

	Pentagon Sends More Jets to Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon today ordered 68 U.S. planes to  
join about 1,000 allied aircraft fighting in Kosovo, and Secretary 
of State Madeleine Albright blamed President Slobodan Milosevic of 
Yugoslavia for prolonging the 10-week air war. ``Milosevic's 
brutality made NATO's response necessary,'' Albright told graduates 
of Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service. She said NATO 
bombs inadvertently have killed civilians, despite ``great pains'' 
to avoid deadly errors. The 48 Air Force fighter jets and 20 
tankers will head for Europe next week, bringing to 769 the number 
of U.S. planes involved in the airstrikes that began March 24.

	Vitter Wins Louisiana Race  
</P>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Former state Rep. David Vitter was elected  
today as Bob Livingston's successor in Congress, winning a close 
election over former Gov. Dave Treen. With 99 percent of the 
precincts reporting, Vitter got 60,699 votes, or 51 percent, to 
Treen's 58,825 votes, or 49 percent. The two solidly conservative 
Republican lawyers, both veteran politicians, struggled to point 
out their differences after they were the top finishers in a field 
of nine in a May 1 primary. Vitter, 38, hoped to use youth to his 
advantage, saying the 70-year-old Treen's influence would be 
diminished because of his age.

	Astronauts Ready for Spacewalk  
</P>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- After Discovery's astronauts docked  
flawlessly with the new international space station today, they 
geared up for their next adventure: a late-night stroll to spruce 
up the station's outside. Among their duties during the six-hour 
outing: attaching a pair of 5-foot cranes to the exterior of the 
station, hanging out bags of tools for future spacewalkers, 
installing a glare-reducing shroud over a docking target, and 
covering an exposed pin. The spacewalk, by Tamara Jernigan and Dr. 
Daniel Barry, was expected to last into the wee hours tomorrow.

	Report: Prosecutors Want Tripp Tapes  
</P>
<P>
	ELLICOTT CITY, Md. (AP) -- Maryland prosecutors have asked the  
federal judge overseeing a grand jury investigation of President 
Clinton for access to Linda Tripp's secret tape recordings of 
Monica Lewinsky, a newspaper reported. State prosecutors filed the 
request with U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson, 
unidentified sources told The (Baltimore) Sun today. A Maryland 
grand jury is considering whether Mrs. Tripp broke Maryland law by 
recording conversations with Ms. Lewinsky. If tried and convicted, 
she could get five years in prison and a $10,000 fine.

	Swede Wins European Song Contest  
</P>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- A Swedish singer won Europe's biggest song  
contest on Sunday in Jerusalem with a performance that was a 
throwback to the 1970s and the Swedish supergroup ABBA. Charlotte 
Nilsson, who won by singing ``Take Me To Your Heaven'' in a 
1970s-style pink-and-beige pantsuit, acknowledged the song mimicked 
the harmonies and chorus of the Swedish band. ``I guess it sounds a 
little like ABBA,'' she said at a news conference after the 
contest. It was Sweden's fourth win.

	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- For the second straight game, the Buffalo  
Sabres protected their star goalie with dogged checking, and Geoff 
Sanderson scored twice to key a 5-2 victory over the Toronto Maple 
Leafs tonight. Sanderson's goals highlighted a four-goal second 
period as the Sabres sent the Maple Leafs to the brink of 
elimination in the Eastern Conference finals. The victory, 
Buffalo's seventh straight at home without a loss in the playoffs, 
gave the Sabres a 3-1 lead in the series, which resumes Monday 
night in Toronto.

	Spurs Take Game 1 From Blazers  
</P>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- San Antonio's Twin Towers were a tad too much  
for the Portland Trail Blazers in Game 1 of the Western Conference 
finals. Tim Duncan and David Robinson each scored 21 points today 
as the Spurs held off the Blazers 80-76. Mario Elie, who held 
Portland's Isaiah Rider to 13 points and made a driving layup to 
put the Spurs ahead 78-74 with 2:35 to play, clinched San Antonio's 
seventh consecutive playoff victory with two free throws with 4.3 
seconds to play.

<HEADLINE> Indy 500 Focuses on Fan Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Arie's on his final ride, Tony's doing the  
double and the Indy Racing League is at least talking to its bitter 
rival. 
</P>
<P>
	All compelling stories, to be sure. But nothing matters more at  
the Indianapolis 500 on Sunday than keeping the action on the track 
and away from the nearly 400,000 fans. 
</P>
<P>
	The event will be the first for the IRL since a wheel and  
suspension parts flew into the grandstand in Concord, N.C., on May 
1, killing three fans and injuring eight others. 
</P>
<P>
	``The story of this race needs to be about racing, not  
tragedy,'' said Arie Luyendyk, a two-time Indy winner who will 
retire from the cockpit following the checkered flag. 
</P>
<P>
	In an effort to avoid another fatal wreck, the cars will be  
fitted with cables designed to keep wheels and suspension parts out 
of the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad the IRL has addressed this situation so quickly, but  
I'm going to be sure to not be the first one to test it,'' said 
Billy Boat, who will start from the outside of the front row. 
</P>
<P>
	Tethering wheels could add to the danger for drivers because the  
tires might rebound into the open cockpit during a crash. But Leo 
Mehl, executive director of the IRL, believes the new safety system 
will be better for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you analyze the crashes and see the loose stuff running  
out on the racetrack, the more we can keep attached to the race 
car, the better off the driver as well as the fans are going to 
be,'' Mehl said. 
</P>
<P>
	Like most of the drivers, Luyendyk shrugged off the added  
danger. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's inherent in our business that the driver is always in  
jeopardy,'' Luyendyk said. ``I don't want to get hit in the head. 
I've been in crashes where I woke up 30 minutes later. But, you 
have to do everything you can to protect the fans. They're the No. 
1 priority.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although everyone is talking about the safety of fans, once the  
green flag waves, the action on the track will probably produce one 
of the most compelling races in years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really believe there are 15 guys out here who could win the  
race, including me,'' said defending champion Eddie Cheever, who 
will start 16th, one spot better than last year. 
</P>
<P>
	If he does win, Cheever will be the first driver to win  
consecutive Indy 500s since Al Unser Sr. in 1970-71. 
</P>
<P>
	Cheever, however, is the only top contender using the Nissan  
Infiniti engine, which has never won an IRL event. In fact, only 
Cheever, Roberto Guerrero and rookie Jeret Schroeder are not using 
the Oldsmobile Aurora powerplant. 
</P>
<P>
	Luyendyk, meanwhile, would love to emulate Bobby Unser, who  
retired in 1981 after winning his third Indy 500. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm enjoying all of this,'' said the Flying Dutchman, who won  
the Indy 500 in 1990 and 1997. ``I'm not sad, because I'm not going 
away. I'll be working as a broadcaster or something else that will 
keep me around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Luyendyk, at 45 the oldest driver in the lineup, owns nearly  
every speed record at Indy going into his 15th and final start. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know, I felt so small when I walked into this place, it  
almost scared me seeing the cars going into turn one flat out,'' 
said Luyendyk, who won the fastest 500 ever in 1990 with an average 
speed of 185.981 mph. ``To become part of Indianapolis history is 
pretty neat for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another fan favorite is Tony Stewart, the 1997 IRL champion, who  
has virtually abandoned the struggling 4-year-old open-wheel 
circuit for a full-time job in NASCAR's Winston Cup series. 
</P>
<P>
	But Stewart grew up in nearby Columbus, Ind., and made sure that  
part of his deal with owner Joe Gibbs was that the former 
Washington Redskins coach would allow him to race at Indy each 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of races that are important to me that I still  
want to try to win in my lifetime,'' the 28-year-old Stewart said. 
``But I would say that if I could only guarantee that I was going 
to win one of them, this would be the one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His first obligation these days is to NASCAR, though, and  
Stewart will take part in a rare double on Sunday. Immediately 
after the 500, he plans to take a helicopter out of the speedway, 
jump on a private jet and, hopefully, arrive in Concord, N.C., in 
time to start the Coca-Cola 600. 
</P>
<P>
	John Andretti, who now races solely in NASCAR, is the only other  
driver who has raced in both events since they've been run on the 
same day. In 1994, Andretti finished 10th at Indy and crashed out 
of the NASCAR race. 
</P>
<P>
	Other contenders at the 83rd Indy 500 include front-row starters  
Greg Ray and Boat, former IRL champions Scott Sharp and Kenny 
Brack, and two-time runner-up Scott Goodyear and Buddy Lazier, the 
only other former race winner in the Indy lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	With at least preliminary negotiations under way between the IRL  
and rival Championship Auto Racing Teams about a possible 
reunification of open-wheel racing, this could be the last Indy 500 
without the big-name teams and drivers in CART. 
</P>
<P>
	But IRL president Tony George says don't put the CART cars back  
on the track yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as we have different philosophies, we're never going  
to strike any kind of accord,'' he said. ``I can't say I'm 
encouraged by anything we talked about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With TV ratings and prestige slipping since the first IRL Indy  
in 1996, a merger would make the 500 the premier auto race once 
again. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it would be wonderful,'' said Ray, whose career path  
was leading to CART before the IRL was formed. ``The IRL is a 
business and CART is a business, and businesses occasionally sling 
mud at each other. I think drivers respect one another. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the two series can coexist perfectly if they work  
together.''

<HEADLINE> Carry-On Luggage OK, but Not Coffee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When airline passengers carry their own coffee  
onto a flight, should they expect to keep drinking it through 
takeoff? 
</P>
<P>
	A simple question, perhaps, but it has set the government  
bureaucracy in motion and triggered official soul-searching about 
consistency and common sense in airline rulemaking. 
</P>
<P>
	For passengers on Alaska Airlines, carry-on coffee is a no-no.  
The Federal Aviation Administration inspector who oversees the West 
Coast carrier has ruled that hot liquid presents a danger to other 
passengers if there is a sudden stop. 
</P>
<P>
	Flight attendants must collect all cups -- regardless of whether  
they were brought on by passengers or given out by the airline -- 
before a plane finishes taxiing for takeoff. 
</P>
<P>
	But inspectors overseeing Alaska's competitors, especially those  
flying out coffee-mad Seattle, have not forced those airlines to 
follow suit. Passengers can keep sipping their latte, even as their 
plane roars into the sky. 
</P>
<P>
	An Alaska Airlines flight attendant recently complained about  
the difference at an airline safety conference. Nick Lacey, head of 
flight standards at the FAA, said the attendant had a point. 
</P>
<P>
	Lacey has decided to investigate whether the agency is  
inconsistent in applying its flight rules. He said the review will 
extend beyond the mere question of drinking joe on the fly. 
</P>
<P>
	Another FAA rule, for example, says U.S. airlines cannot use  
glassware once a plane begins to taxi, out of concern for broken 
glass. For coach customers, that is not a problem because drinks 
are served in plastic cups, and only after takeoff. 
</P>
<P>
	It is a different story in first or business class.  
</P>
<P>
	Airline executives believe that passengers who pay for premium  
service should touch only linen, china or crystal. The treatment 
starts with a free preflight drink, served in a sparkling glass. 
</P>
<P>
	But the FAA rule on glassware forces airlines to violate their  
guiding principle once a plane leaves the gate for the runway 
because glasses must be collected and champagne, Bloody Marys or 
other drinks poured into plastic cups. Prior to takeoff, even those 
are taken away. 
</P>
<P>
	Most foreign carriers have no such ban on glassware. U.S.  
airlines complain that government zealousness about their cups is 
putting them at another competitive disadvantage. 
</P>
<P>
	``On a summer evening international departure out of Kennedy  
Airport, there can be up to a 45-minute wait between pushback and 
takeoff,'' Lacey said in an interview last week. ``A lot of 
(premium-class) customers like to be able to enjoy a drink in that 
time, and the airlines want to serve it to them in a glass.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The disputes are rooted in the FAA rulebook, which details how a  
cabin must be configured for takeoff and landing. 
</P>
<P>
	As even the least frequent flier knows, passengers must stow all  
luggage in the overhead compartments or under the seat before 
takeoff and landing. The only universal exceptions are for small 
items like books or newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	FAA policy also requires that airlines collect all ``service  
items.'' That means everything from a preflight cup of water to a 
food tray. 
</P>
<P>
	The reduction in airline food service, coupled with the growth  
of specialty coffee and the boom in airport food stands, have 
raised the question about how to handle carry-on consumables. In a 
recent teleconference with FAA inspectors, Lacey found that the 
inspector overseeing Alaska Airlines appeared to be the only one 
forcing his airline to collect coffee cups. 
</P>
<P>
	Other inspectors did not view carry-on coffee as a hazard  
because of the coffee would be gone or, at best, warm by takeoff. 
</P>
<P>
	While Lacey is not ready to make a final decision about carry-on  
coffee, glassware and other passenger conveniences, he gave an 
indication that he may follow the rule of common sense, rather than 
existing policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``My thinking is that unless there is a real legitimate safety  
concern, we should yield to the service-side of it,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Livingston Successor To Be Chosen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Voters tonight are selecting Bob Livingston's  
successor in Congress, closing a campaign in which two solidly 
conservative Republican lawyers, both veteran politicians, 
struggled to point out their differences. 
</P>
<P>
	With 17 percent of precincts reporting, former state Rep. David  
Vitter was leading with 9,873 votes, or 52 percent, to former Gov. 
Dave Treen's 9,140 votes, or 48 percent. They were the top two 
finishers from a field of nine in a May 1 primary in which all 
candidates appeared on one ballot regardless of party affiliation. 
</P>
<P>
	Perennial candidate and ex-Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke  
finished third in that race. 
</P>
<P>
	Treen ran as a well-connected insider with built-in seniority  
and valuable contacts owing to the seven years he served in 
Congress before being elected governor in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	Vitter, 38, hoped to use youth to his advantage, saying the  
70-year-old Treen's influence would be diminished because of his 
age. 
</P>
<P>
	Influence was the issue because Livingston, in a 20-year  
congressional career, proved adept at steering federal money to the 
home district, snagging federal funds for flood control projects 
and steering defense contracts to shipyards. 
</P>
<P>
	Livingston was chairman of the Appropriations Committee and in  
line to be speaker last year when he learned, as House members 
moved toward impeaching President Clinton, that news of his past 
marital infidelities was about to break. He confessed and resigned, 
urging Clinton to follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
	The runoff campaign was interrupted in its final week when  
Treen's 20-year-old grandson disappeared during a hike in the 
Oregon wilderness. He was found safe on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The final days of the campaign then got nasty. The candidates  
were in attack mode Friday evening during a debate on WWL-AM radio. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke was an issue at times. Treen denounced Vitter for putting  
out campaign mailers saying Duke supported the former governor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did put it out and it's true but I'm tired of having my  
integrity bashed by you. You're trying to have it both ways,'' 
Vitter responded. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke has not endorsed anyone but said he would vote for Treen  
over Vitter. 
</P>
<P>
	Some small position differences emerged between the two  
candidates during the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Vitter denounced all forms of gun control. Treen said he defends  
the right to bear arms but is not opposed to some restrictions on 
more sophisticated weapons automatic or semiautomatic weapons. And 
he said gun dealers at gun shows should be subjected to the same 
background check requirements as regular gun retailers. 
</P>
<P>
	Both said they opposed affirmative action but Treen also said he  
was against the federal government banning colleges and 
universities from deciding their own racial admission policies.

<HEADLINE> Indians' Wright Defends His Pitching </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Gene Budig didn't need a 95 mph fastball to  
back Jaret Wright off the plate and get inside the pitcher's head. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright said his poor start last night against the Red Sox may  
have been partially caused by Budig's request that Wright appear in 
the AL president's office next week to discuss the pitcher's 
behavior on the mound. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright, who earlier this season was suspended for five games for  
hitting Boston outfielder Darren Lewis, was ordered in by Budig 
after being fined this week for his role in a brawl with the 
Detroit Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I went out there trying not to let it, trying not to think  
about it, but I think it did a little bit,'' Wright said Saturday. 
``I think I was out there and I let it get into my head a little 
bit. ... Still, there's no excuse for bad pitching.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After he was hammered for eight runs and nine hit in a  
season-low 3 2-3 innings, Wright didn't wait around to talk with 
reporters after Boston's 12-5 victory Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	So following batting practice Saturday, Wright met the media in  
the Cleveland dugout to discuss his upcoming meeting with Budig and 
to dispute charges that he is a headhunter. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright said he was taken off guard by Budig's public  
announcement that he would speak with the 23-year-old pitcher about 
his ``deportment on the mound.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically when I heard that, I was surprised like everybody  
else,'' he said. ``I didn't necessarily agree with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wright, who dropped to 4-3 with a 6.95 ERA following Friday's  
disaster, said he wouldn't speculate on what Budig might want to 
talk about. But he did make it clear he thinks charges that he's 
throwing at hitters are out of line. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I threw the ball everywhere that I wanted to then I would  
get a lot more guys out,'' he said. ``I've never let a ball go out 
of my hand with the intention of hitting anyone in the head. 
</P>
<P>
	``When that happens that's not part of the game, it never has  
been. I was never taught that. For anyone to see that about me, 
that I'm a headhunter or something like that, that's not what I'm 
about. I'm out there to get guys out, to pitch in off the plate 
which I think is part of the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never let a ball go with the intention of hitting someone  
in the head. No way. ... I've never tried to hit anyone in the 
head. I've never done anything like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wright said he's shocked at all the attention his situation has  
been receiving. He acknowledged that pointing at his head after he 
hit Lewis last month was wrong, and admits he probably needs to get 
the ball down if he's going to challenge hitters inside. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think their (league) biggest problem is that the ball has  
been just a little high,'' he said. ``When I want to brush someone 
back or pitch in off the plate, it's been a little high and I 
understand that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wright said he was unconcerned about where the accusations of  
headhunting started and his main goal now was to put the past 
behind him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe that's wasted energy,'' he said. ``It wouldn't serve  
any purpose for me to find out where it started. I need to deal 
with what's happening right now and try to pitch a little better. 
That's about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indians catcher Sandy Alomar, currently sidelined following knee  
surgery, thinks Wright is being singled out by Budig because he's 
young and not an established veteran. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's very unfair to take a young guy and call him into  
the office,'' said Alomar. ``Jaret pitches inside and yesterday 
they took that part of his game away. That's not fair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alomar said he can tell during a game when Wright's control is  
off, and when it is, Alomar says he stays in the middle of the 
plate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't move because I don't want to see anyone get hit,'' he  
said. ``If you're going to look at Jaret, you had better look at a 
lot of other guys in this league. Because Jaret sure isn't the only 
one who likes to pitch inside. You can't treat a young guy 
differently than a veteran. That's not right.''

<HEADLINE> Cow Born With Mickey Mouse Markings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FARLEY, Iowa (AP) -- Mickey the cow has more of a trademark than  
a birthmark. 
</P>
<P>
	Right above her eyes, the 8-month-old, brown-and-white heifer  
carries a symbol known the world over: the two ears and round face 
of Mickey Mouse. 
</P>
<P>
	``What are the odds?'' said Darlene Simon, whose family owns the  
calf. ``Astronomical.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At first, the Simons, an eastern Iowa farm family, didn't fuss  
over the calf when she was born in September, afraid the unusual 
brown marking on her face would change. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got more excited this winter,'' said Roger Simon, Darlene's  
husband. ``It got bigger as her face got bigger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Simons, who run several businesses and a farm near this  
eastern Iowa town, first allowed Mickey to run with other calves. 
But with the Mickey mark apparently here to stay, she's been moved 
to a separate pen and is being trained to be led on a halter. 
Mickey is also being corn-fed, washed and groomed. 
</P>
<P>
	As word has spread, people have come to see Mickey for  
themselves. The calf is friendly and allows visitors to pet her, 
the family said. 
</P>
<P>
	It has the Simons thinking: Maybe Mickey has a future in show  
business. 
</P>
<P>
	``We plan to take her places,'' Roger Simon said. ``The sky's  
the limit. It's how big a dream you have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Simons have yet to hear back from Disneyland or the  
television talk shows they've called. But it's hard not to think 
big when the family tunes into the Disney Channel, Darlene Simon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's that little emblem in the corner of the screen,'' she  
said. ``That's Mickey.''

<HEADLINE> Skater Starts Soap Stint </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Tara Lipinski caught the world's attention by  
snatching the gold medal for women's figure skating at the Nagano 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the teen-ager is catching the attention of a different  
audience -- soap opera fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Lipinski will start a three-month stint next week playing  
Marnie, a feisty pre-med student, on her favorite CBS daytime 
drama, ``The Young and the Restless.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I accomplished my life goal, but now there are so many other  
things left,'' Lipinski told People Magazine in an interview 
published in its June 7 issue. Her episodes begin airing June 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Lipinksi won the gold in at the 1998 Winter Olympics and decided  
to turn pro instead of skating for a second gold medal in the 2002 
Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``Going pro means I can get off the ice and relax, meet friends,  
have a teen-age life,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Lipinski, who turns 17 in June, is not kissing the ice  
goodbye. She is still practicing turns and double-axels 10 hours a 
week to stay in shape for ``Stars on Ice,'' a 62-city skating tour 
this winter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love skating, and I could never give it up,'' Lipinski said.  
``But doing things like this on the side is fun.''

<HEADLINE> JFK's Casket Was Dropped in Ocean </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                               *and    	
</P>
<P>
                           *DEB RIECHMANN   	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A bronze casket used to carry President  
Kennedy's body from Dallas to Washington is in a watery grave -- 
9,000 feet down in the Atlantic Ocean, according to assassination 
documents. 
</P>
<P>
	Materials to be released Tuesday at the National Archives will  
show that in early 1965 the casket was dropped from a military 
plane into an area where unstable and outdated weapons and 
ammunition are dumped, Kermit Hall, a member of the now-defunct 
Assassination Records Review Board, told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	``The documents that will be released show it was dropped off  
the Maryland-Delaware border in 9,000 feet of water,'' Hall said 
Friday night. ``There's actually a map in the documents that 
pinpoints the coordinates where it was dropped.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The revelation -- on the eve of what would have been President  
Kennedy's 82nd birthday today -- that the casket was sunk resolves a 
lingering mystery about its whereabouts. But it also fuels 
speculation among assassination researchers that it was discarded 
to hide foul play. 
</P>
<P>
	``The coffin is evidence just like the body is evidence,'' said  
David Lifton, who wrote a book about medical evidence in the Nov. 
22, 1963, assassination. ``You don't destroy evidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What happened to the bronze casket has been a lingering question  
over the past three decades. Last year a document released by the 
archives showed that a General Services Administration truck picked 
up the coffin on March 19, 1964. 
</P>
<P>
	In its effort to ferret assassination-related documents and  
information from various government agencies, the review panel 
asked the GSA where the casket was. The agency said in the summer 
of 1998 that it didn't know. 
</P>
<P>
	The documents from GSA and the Justice and Defense departments  
being released next week, however, describe the disposition in 
detail, Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Essentially what was going on was an effort to make sure the  
casket didn't turn into a historic relic for the marketplace,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy was buried at Arlington National Cemetery in a mahogany  
coffin that had been purchased in Washington to replace the bronze 
one, which was missing a handle and had been damaged. 
</P>
<P>
	In September 1965, former Texas Rep. Earle Cabell wrote to  
then-Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach recommending that the 
bronze casket be discarded so it could never become a relic. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is an extremely handsome, expensive, all-bronze, silk-lined  
casket, and fortunately, and properly, was paid for by the General 
Services Administration, and presently is in the possession of 
GSA,'' Cabell wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	``This item has ... value for the morbidly curious. And I  
believe that I am correct in stating that this morbid curiosity is 
that which we all seek to stop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Katzenbach said in an interview Friday that he doesn't recall  
details about the disposition of the casket. If anyone had asked 
him if it should be disposed of, ``I'd have said that's a good 
idea,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lifton thinks there might have been a darker motive.  
</P>
<P>
	In conducting his research, Lifton talked with witnesses who  
said Kennedy's body arrived at Bethesda Naval Hospital in a gray 
metal shipping casket, not the bronze one obtained in Dallas. That 
the bronze casket was dumped in the ocean -- after the Warren 
Commission issued its report in 1964 -- makes him wonder what clues 
it might have yielded to investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it had been an ongoing murder investigation, this would be  
obstruction of justice,'' Lifton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Douglas Horne, who was the chief analyst for military records at  
the congressionally created review board, speculated that the 
bronze casket was destroyed to end the two-coffin controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the way to get rid of the problem is you get rid of  
the casket. You throw it out of an airplane,'' said Horne.

<HEADLINE> Whitman: Increase Military Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite large-scale troop deployments abroad,  
the U.S. military has shrunk 40 percent in a decade to a level 
incapable of adequately carrying out its missions, GOP Gov. 
Christie Whitman of New Jersey said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitman, speaking in the party's weekly radio address, marked  
the Memorial Day commemoration with appeals for money to increase 
military readiness and to help veterans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very concerned that the budget the president has proposed  
abandons our obligation to veterans,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	She complained that Department of Veterans Affairs hospitals in  
New Jersey lack the money to operate at full strength. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot and must not fail to care for those who suffer the  
scars of service,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the active duty forces, Whitman said: ``Our military has  
shrunk by 40 percent this decade, even as our president has been 
deploying troops at a record clip.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said Navy ships have decreased from 546 to 333, fighter  
wings from 24 to 13, Army divisions from 18 to 10. 
</P>
<P>
	The forces are plagued by a shortage of air-launched cruise  
missiles, a $3.5 billion shortfall in ammunition, so few aircraft 
that planes had to be been diverted from no-fly operations in Iraq 
to airstrikes against Yugoslavia, Whitman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Downsizing the bureaucracy is one thing,'' she said.  
``Downsizing our defense is a risk our nation cannot afford.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On a similar theme, conservative activist Gary Bauer, in Iowa  
campaigning for the 2000 presidential caucuses next February, said 
military budget problems have harmed the Balkan bombing campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	He urged increased defense spending of $50 billion or more over  
the next six years. The Joint Chiefs of Staff have said they need 
an additional $60 billion to achieve full combat readiness. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't afford to have our own military leaders telling us  
we're that far short,'' Bauer said at a news conference in Des 
Moines. ``I'm certainly gong to try to make it a major issue of the 
campaign.''

<HEADLINE> Lowell Joins Marlins After Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Testicular cancer gave Florida Marlins rookie third  
baseman Mike Lowell a scare, a new perspective and an extra reason 
to savor his National League debut. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than 24 hours after being recalled from Triple-A, Lowell is  
in the lineup for tonight's game against the Cincinnati Reds. His 
season was sidetracked by surgery Feb. 21 to remove a small 
testicular mass found during a routine physical examination. 
</P>
<P>
	``From a life perspective, things have been put in their place  
because of this,'' said Lowell, 25. ``From a baseball standpoint, I 
don't think my attitude has changed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not one to be complacent. I'm going to be aggressive on  
the field. This is kind of like survival of the fittest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lowell, who grew up in Miami, hit 56 homers in 1997-98 in the  
New York Yankees' farm system, then was traded Feb. 1 to Florida 
for three pitching prospects. He hopes to bolster an offense that 
ranks next-to-last in the major leagues in runs, but he admits that 
surgery has temporarily robbed him of the power he had last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can play every day. From that standpoint, I'm 100 percent,''  
he said. ``Strength-wise, I don't know if I'm going to be 100 
percent the whole year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Triple-A Calgary, Lowell hit .313 with two homers and nine  
RBIs in 83 at-bats. His rehabilitation was complicated by soreness 
in his throwing shoulder that has since subsided. 
</P>
<P>
	Following surgery, Lowell underwent a short course of low-dose  
radiation, and he said his prognosis is excellent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Health-wise everything has been best-case scenario,'' he said.  
``I can't complain. Things could have been worse. I'm just happy to 
be on the field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Marlins' third baseman for most of the season, Kevin Orie,  
went on the disabled list Friday with a pulled groin. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowell emerged as a top prospect last year, when he hit .304 at  
Triple-A Columbus with 26 homers and 99 RBIs. He believes he's 
ready for the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is what I've wanted to do, so you can't shy away from  
it,'' he said. ``You have to have confidence in yourself.''

<HEADLINE> School Where 6 Shot Has Graduation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONYERS, Ga. (AP) -- The Heritage High School Class of 1999  
graduated Friday night and came together one last time in the 
school commons where six fellow students were wounded by a 
classmate who opened fire eight days earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	While none of those wounded were among the 275 seniors, the  
violence that seemed to shatter their lives last week brought them 
together at graduation, said Steven Brown, a school counselor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Usually they never hang out this long after graduation. This  
never happens,'' Brown said after the ceremony ended and students 
remained in the commons area for 45 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Seniors went back to the commons to cheer, hug and celebrate  
their accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
	``They bounced back real quick and they didn't let it faze  
them,'' Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
	All six students who were wounded May 20 when a student began  
shooting in the commons area were released from the hospital after 
being treated for gunshot wounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspect, T.J. Solomon, 15, faces 20 counts of aggravated  
assault, cruelty to children and weapons charges. District Attorney 
Richard Read has said he will ask a juvenile court judge to allow 
Solomon to be tried as an adult. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the last eight days, Heritage has been known worldwide for  
a single incident -- a tragedy,'' Shaffiq Welji said during his 
speech in the packed gym. ``My 13 years of schooling, however, have 
made me look at that day's events as a single occurrence, minuscule 
in comparison to the achievements of our class of 1999.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Extra officers patrolled the ceremony, which parents and  
teachers tried to focus on achievements rather than a rehash of the 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	``Forget about the past, we are the future,'' Class President  
Martin Humphrey said as the ceremony came to a close.

<HEADLINE> Store Agrees to $8M in Refunds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federated Department Stores must make refunds  
totaling $8 million or more to customers illegally pursued for debt 
collection after they declared bankruptcy, the Federal Trade 
Commission said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission settlement ensures the Federated, which operates  
Bloomingdale's, Burdines, Macy's East, Macy's West and other 
retailers, fully reimburses consumers under a deal negotiated with 
numerous state attorneys general. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC alleged that Federated induced consumers into agreements  
to reaffirm their credit-account debts in order to keep purchased 
merchandise. The company told consumers it would file the 
reaffirmation agreements with bankruptcy courts, and the bankrupt 
customers would be legally obligated to pay. 
</P>
<P>
	In many cases, the FTC charged, the company never filed  
agreements or courts did not approve them. Such reaffirmation 
agreements are not illegal but by law must be filed with bankruptcy 
courts. If not filed or approved by the court, the agreements are 
unenforceable. 
</P>
<P>
	About 20,000 bankrupt debtors may have paid the company, even  
though the agreements were not binding. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Friday's settlement, Federated is prohibited from falsely  
claiming that any reaffirmation agreement is binding or has been 
filed with a bankruptcy court. The company also would be barred 
from collecting debts discharged by the bankruptcy courts. 
</P>
<P>
	Federated recently settled a multiple state action by agreeing  
to provide redress to customers who had paid debts they did not 
legally owe. Friday's settlement preserves the FTC's right to act 
against the company in federal court if the commission believes 
payments have not been made or if the redress amounts to less than 
$8.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	A settlement does not constitute an admission of wrongdoing.

<HEADLINE> Making Claim in the Racing Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	You've heard it before: If Kentucky Derby and Preakness winner  
Charismatic takes the $1 million Belmont Stakes on June 5, he will 
become the first claiming horse to win a Triple Crown. 
</P>
<P>
	But what exactly is a claiming horse, or, more popularly, a  
``claimer?'' 
</P>
<P>
	A claiming race means that any horse entered can be bought on  
the spot for a predetermined price. 
</P>
<P>
	When Charismatic ran for a ``tag'' on Feb. 11, a trainer on the  
grounds of Santa Anita could have filled out a form, dropped it in 
the claiming box 15 minutes before the race, and walked away with 
the future Kentucky Derby winner for the claiming price of $62,500. 
</P>
<P>
	By entering Charismatic in such a claiming race, trainer D.  
Wayne Lukas took the risk of losing him -- and fortunately for 
owners Bob and Beverly Lewis, that didn't happen. At the time, 
Lukas said he was ``scared to death'' someone would put in a claim. 
</P>
<P>
	Horses generally don't run in claiming races unless there is  
nowhere else for them to run. In other words, they're usually not 
fast enough to run in stakes races, nor do they have the ability to 
compete in allowance races against well-bred horses on their way to 
bigger and better things. 
</P>
<P>
	``Claiming races give horses the opportunity to run against  
lesser horses and also give owners the chance to make money,'' said 
Mike Lakow, racing secretary for the New York Racing Association. 
``If you have a real nice horse, you're taking a shot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Charismatic's case, the Lewises were ready to give up on him  
after he won just two of nine starts. It was not the return they 
expected after shelling out $200,000 to purchase him as a weanling. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis put him in the February claiming race because ``quite  
frankly, I'd given up on the horse. I wanted to salvage as much of 
that original $200,000 investment as I could.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Claiming races comprise about 30-40 percent of the races run at  
the bigger meets and bigger racetracks in New York, California and 
Kentucky. At the smaller tracks, and during the winter, up to 80 
percent of races run are claiming races, with the purse and the 
claiming price just about equal. 
</P>
<P>
	Horses can run for as little as $1,500 or as much as $100,000.  
The races are usually competitive, as it makes no sense to run a 
horse worth $70,000 in a $35,000 race (you'd lose him), nor does it 
make sense to run a $35,000 horse in a $70,000 race (you'd have no 
chance to win). 
</P>
<P>
	And, its a cash-and-carry deal -- the person doing the claiming  
takes the horse ``as is'' as soon as the race is over, no matter 
what happens in the race. 
</P>
<P>
	It has happened that people have wound up claiming dead horses,  
and then, to add to the ignominy, the new owner is responsible for 
burial fees. The former owner gets to keep the purse money, if any. 
</P>
<P>
	Some trainers, such as Gasper Moschera and Mike Hushion in New  
York, specialize in the claiming game, continually taking horses 
and improving them before losing them again, but at a higher price. 
Hushion claimed Reappeal for $14,000 in December 1991, won 10 races 
and more than $175,000 with him, and lost him a year later for 
$25,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Trainers such as Lukas, Shug McGaughey, Bill Mott or Bob  
Baffert, whose barns are filled with blue-blooded thoroughbreds, 
only occasionally send a horse into a claiming race, and usually it 
is a higher-priced race -- $50,000 and up. 
</P>
<P>
	Although claimers are considered lesser-caliber horses, stars  
have emerged from their ranks. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1943, trainer Max Hirsch claimed a horse named Stymie for  
$1,500 and went on to win almost a $1 million with him. Kelly Kip, 
a multiple track record holder, started his career for Hall of Fame 
trainer Allen Jerkens in a maiden claiming race, in which he 
promptly broke the track record at Belmont for 5 1/2 furlongs. 
Moschera claimed a horse named Videogenic for $100,000 in 1985 in 
New York and went on to win 11 stakes races with her, including the 
Grade I Santa Ana and Ladies Handicaps. 
</P>
<P>
	And then, there's Charismatic.  
</P>
<P>
	``Isn't that incredible?'' Lewis said after the Kentucky Derby.  
``You can have a claimer today and all of a sudden have a champion 
tomorrow.''

<HEADLINE> Son of Radio Host Sues District </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- The son of radio talk show host Art Bell sued a  
school district and a former substitute teacher who is serving a 
life prison sentence for sexually assaulting him. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell's son, Arthur Bell IV, is seeking unspecified damages in  
federal court, accusing the Nye County School District, its 
superintendent and a high school principal of negligently hiring, 
supervising and retaining former substitute teacher Brian Lepley. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit also names Lepley, who was sentenced in May 1998 to  
life in prison for engaging in sexual acts with the younger Bell 
when he was a 16-year-old student and an 18-year-old man, the Las 
Vegas Review-Journal reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors claimed Lepley, who is infected with the AIDS virus,  
supplied his victims with marijuana and alcohol on several 
occasions. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit was originally filed in November, a month after the  
teen's father suddenly announced he was quitting his radio program, 
a nationwide show with 15 million listeners that features theories 
from space aliens to CIA conspiracies. Bell had cited an 
unspecified ``threatening terrible event'' that occurred to his 
family. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks after quitting the airwaves on Oct. 13, Bell returned  
on Oct. 28 without explanation. 
</P>
<P>
	In an amended complaint filed Friday in Las Vegas, the younger  
Bell identified himself in the lawsuit, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	John Hawley, who represents Bell's son, and Bell have refused  
repeated requests for comment on the lawsuit.

	NATO Strikes Serb Forces in Kosovo

<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- European leaders struggled to revive  
their quest for a diplomatic way out of the Kosovo crisis today, 
but common ground remained elusive as NATO renewed its pledge to 
strike Yugoslavia until the alliance's terms for peace are met. The 
German and French prime ministers called for a new meeting of the 
leading industrial states and Russia to assess the results of talks 
between Moscow's Balkans envoy, Viktor Chernomyrdin, and Yugoslav 
President Slobodan Milosevic. NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana 
said during a visit to the Istrana base in northern Italy that he 
backs the French-German proposal, the Italian news agency AGI

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The world is getting hotter and Mother Nature

of global trends finds. Worldwatch Institute's annual eclectic 
compilation of facts and figures, ``Vital Signs 1999,'' offers a 
little something for everyone making predictions about where the 
planet and its inhabitants are headed in the next century. An

	SEATTLE (AP) -- Authorities today were still trying to understand  
what sent a man on a killing spree, but first they had to tally the 
dead and wounded: his mother and nephew stabbed to death, a woman 
fatally beaten, another woman critically injured, a motorcyclist 
run over and a sheriff's deputy shot. Believed to be responsible 
for it all was 22-year-old Lonnie Davis, who was shot dead by a 
police sniper after a standoff with police in a northern suburb of

	VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- A truck loaded with paint crashed into  
the back of a car deep inside a tunnel in western Austria early 
today, setting off a chain reaction of explosions and a massive 
blaze that killed at least one person and injured dozens, officials 
said. Firefighters, who were initially unable to get at the fire 
because of the intense heat and thick black smoke, feared the death 
toll in the north-south Tauern tunnel would rise. It was the second 
deadly Alpine tunnel fire in just over two months. At least 100 
people were treated in hospitals, three of them in critical 
condition.

independent state. A statement issued at the end of talks between 
Jordan's King Abdullah and Lebanese President Emile Lahoud said 
Israel's negotiations with Syria and Lebanon ``should resume from 
where they broke off'' in 1996. During his one-day stay in Jordan, 
Lahoud laid a wreathe at the tomb of the late King Hussein, who 
died of cancer last February.

Obasanjo embraced the outgoing military ruler, Gen. Abdulsalami

Louis Cardinals 4-3 today. The Cardinals, playing without Mark 
McGwire, who stayed at the team hotel to treat an infected corn on 
his right foot, took a 3-2 lead into the ninth. But with one out, 
Hill hit his seventh career pinch-hit homer. Jose Hernandez then 
singled to left and raced around with the winning run when Grace 
drove a double into the right field corner.

<HEADLINE> Braves' Smoltz May Return Wednesday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- John Smoltz said he felt no pain in his right  
elbow after throwing 75-80 pitches in a simulated game today and 
hoped to return to the starting rotation next Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	His biggest concern was his control.  
</P>
<P>
	``It didn't hurt and I just felt a little rusty around the  
strike zone,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta manager Bobby Cox liked what he saw.  
</P>
<P>
	``He threw good,'' Cox said. ``He had good velocity. He threw  
90-92 mph. He was very impressive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cox said he would talk with Smoltz on Saturday night and again  
on Sunday to ``see what he wants to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smoltz has been the best pitcher for the Braves this year,  
bolting to a 5-0 start before losing on May 10 to San Francisco. He 
has a 2.59 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves put him on the 15-day disabled list with an inflamed  
right elbow on May 17. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just going to wait and see how it rebounds then make a  
decision,'' Smoltz said after icing down. ``I might throw one more 
day on the side, probably Monday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he wants to make sure he can be effective before  
returning to the rotation. ``I think today helps.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smoltz said he needs to trust himself and ``not expect to be  
perfect. I want to be, but not expect to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After dropping the 5-1 decision to San Francisco when he allowed  
three runs in seven innings, Smoltz was touched for five runs on 
eight hits in six innings against the Chicago Cubs on May 16. He 
wasn't involved in the decision in that game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I left on a good roll and would like to pick up on that,'' he  
said. ``But, only time will tell.''

<HEADLINE> 3 Feared Dead After Calif. Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Three Southern California Edison Corp.  
employees whose helicopter crashed in fog on their way to a 
business meeting on Catalina Island were missing and feared dead 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	The helicopter crashed Friday morning about three miles off  
Huntington Beach. The three were still missing when the search was 
suspended Friday night; rescuers were to resume the search today. 
</P>
<P>
	The helicopter left Irvine at about 6:30 a.m. and the pilot  
radioed 12 minutes later that he was over the ocean. No distress 
call or further transmission from the helicopter was received, said 
Coast Guard officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The body of a man was spotted from the air by rescuers four  
miles off the coast, but it went underwater and could not be 
retrieved, said Emiko Banfield, a spokeswoman for the utility 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	Crews from the Coast Guard and Huntington Beach Lifeguards  
searched with three ships and a helicopter for the woman and two 
men, whose identities were withheld.

<HEADLINE> L.A. Doctors Vote To Unionize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Hundreds of doctors employed by Los Angeles  
County voted to unionize and become part of a growing number of 
physicians across the nation who are joining the ranks of organized 
labor. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote on Friday was the largest union election for  
post-residency physicians in 18 years, organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 790 county doctors, many of whom care for the poor and  
uninsured, joined the Union of American Physicians and Dentists on 
a 341 to 182 vote, or 65 percent to 35 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're basically concerned with how health care is being  
provided,'' said Janice Nelson, a physician at Los Angeles 
County-USC Medical Center. ``Doctors are frustrated with managed 
care and being dictated to by bean counters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	County officials, who remained neutral during the three-year  
organizing campaign, said they will begin contract talks as soon as 
they are requested. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no idea what they're going to ask for in their  
contract,'' said Rhonda Albey, a labor relations administrator for 
Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 500 of the doctors are affiliated with the area's  
three medical schools that operate county hospitals. Others work 
for the county jail, coroner and public health clinics. 
</P>
<P>
	As many as 45,000 doctors nationwide -- about 6 percent -- belong  
to unions. That's up from about 25,000 two years ago. The Union of 
American Physicians now represents about 6,000 post-residency 
doctors, or those who have completed their last stage of medical 
training. 
</P>
<P>
	The trend stems from the growing influence of health maintenance  
organizations and the belief that administrators have assumed too 
much influence over patient care, the doctors said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson said money was not the driving issue behind Friday's  
vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody works for the county in the public sector in order to  
get rich,'' she said. ``We work because we have a commitment to 
take care of the poor and the uninsured of the county.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The county doctors said they want more say in the care of  
patients and in the construction of a new hospital to replace the 
earthquake-damaged County-USC hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	``Make no mistake about this, we are going to preserve a  
doctor's prerogative to prescribe and deliver the best treatments 
for patients,'' said Robert Weinmann, UAPD president and a San Jose 
neurologist. 
</P>
<P>
	The last major organizing effort was in August 1981, when 1,300  
doctors employed by the state of California voted to join the 
physicians' union. The UAPD is affiliated with the American 
Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.

<HEADLINE> 'Star Wars' Fans Swap Inside Trivia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Did baby talk really inspire the chattery  
beeps and squawks of R2-D2? 
</P>
<P>
	Was the Millennium Falcon starship modeled on a hamburger with  
an olive next to it? 
</P>
<P>
	Burt Reynolds considered as Han Solo?  
</P>
<P>
	True. True. And false.  
</P>
<P>
	With fans flocking to see ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom  
Menace,'' urban legends surrounding the films have become more 
plentiful than Yoda's grammatical mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of Web sites full of ``Star Wars'' trivia have popped up  
and newly enthusiastic fans are sharing insider tidbits like 
popcorn in freewheeling chat rooms. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a quasi, national geek-pastime to studiously examine the  
existing films,'' said Paul Alvarado-Dykstra, a contributing editor 
on the movie-fan Web site aint-it-cool-news.com. ``It's hard to 
draw the line between what is really definitive or what is 
reinvented.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spurious rumors have reached director George Lucas' headquarters  
at Skywalker Ranch in Novato, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	``My favorite was the one about Kenneth Branagh playing Obi-Wan  
Kenobi, which was never true,'' said Lynn Hale, a Lucas 
spokeswoman. ``Everybody insisted he had the role, even after we 
said Ewan McGregor was cast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alternate casting is a favored item of ``Star Wars'' gossip,  
with fans speculating that everyone from Burt Reynolds to 
Christopher Walken were once signed to play rogue starship pilot 
Han Solo, the role that eventually made Harrison Ford famous. 
</P>
<P>
	``George says the Burt Reynolds claim is false,'' Ms. Hale said.  
Walken was in the running, eventually losing out to Ford. 
</P>
<P>
	But is it true Sissy Spacek was the first choice for Princess  
Leia? 
</P>
<P>
	As rumor has it, Carrie Fisher was playing the lead in the 1976  
Stephen King thriller ``Carrie'' but clashed with director Brian De 
Palma because she refused to do nude scenes. Spacek was reportedly 
unhappy with ``Star Wars,'' so the two actresses decided to switch 
roles. 
</P>
<P>
	``No way,'' said Ms. Hale, laughing.  
</P>
<P>
	Some of the seemingly ridiculous legends are true.  
</P>
<P>
	For instance, your mind isn't playing tricks on you if a  
gigantic potato or tennis shoe appears to float past the Millennium 
Falcon during its perilous flight through asteroids in ``The Empire 
Strikes Back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Employees at Industrial Light &AMP; Magic threw the items in as a  
joke. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucas says he really was inspired to design the Millennium  
Falcon while staring at a hamburger with an olive next to it. 
</P>
<P>
	Even erroneous rumors associated with ``Star Wars'' sometimes  
have roots in reality. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Sound designer) Ben Burtt imitated the coos and babbling of  
babies and ... altered that sound to make the voice of R2-D2,'' 
said Ms. Hale. ``But he never used real babies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was Burtt's fondness for using familiar, everyday noises  
rather than digitally created sound effects that led to the rumor 
that some ``Star Wars'' creatures say outrageous sentences in Earth 
languages. 
</P>
<P>
	In ``Return of the Jedi,'' the cuddly Ewoks are rumored to speak  
a Filipino dialect and occasionally say things such as ``Det luktar 
flingor har,'' which is Swedish for ``It smells of corn flakes 
here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The speech patterns may be similar to those languages, but  
that's about all,'' Ms. Hale said. ``(Burtt) likes to use elements 
of real languages to form the ones used by these creatures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the latest hot topics among Star Wars aficionados?  
</P>
<P>
	E.T., Steven Spielberg's famous extraterrestrial, makes a  
background appearance in ``The Phantom Menace.''

<HEADLINE> Producer Paid Censor To Say 'Damn' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It was a pricey ``damn.''  
</P>
<P>
	The producer of ``Gone with the Wind,'' David O. Selznick, paid  
censors $5,000 in 1939 so Rhett Butler could say the word to 
Scarlett O'Hara in their final goodbye. 
</P>
<P>
	The cost in today's money was about $60,000. Sotheby's expects  
to reap that same amount June 12 when it auctions the final 
shooting script from the movie, which has the four-letter word 
neatly typed in. 
</P>
<P>
	In the last scene between the film's lovers, O'Hara (Vivien  
Leigh) asks Butler (Clark Gable) what will become of her, to which 
he utters the now legendary line: ``Frankly my dear, I don't give a 
damn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Included in the script are alternatives to the famous phrase had  
the censors not given in. They were: 
</P>
<P>
	1. Rhett (very slowly): ``Frankly my dear I just -- don't --  
care.'' 
</P>
<P>
	2. ``I wish I could care what you do or where you go -- (he opens  
the door) -- ``but frankly my dear I just don't care.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And frankly, neither of those was likely to be quoted for six  
decades.

<HEADLINE> States, Sweepstakes Company Settle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Florida, Indiana, West Virginia and South  
Carolina: If you are one of the above lucky states, you are a 
winner of a share of $4 million! 
</P>
<P>
	American Family Publishers announced Friday that it had reached  
a $4 million settlement with these states, which had claimed the 
company used deceptive practices in its sweepstakes. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the settlement, American Family agreed to stop  
telling people they are winners or members of a group of finalists 
unless that is actually the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana Attorney General Jeffrey Modisett said the state's share  
of the money -- about $550,000 -- will partially reimburse hundreds 
of residents tricked by the company's mailings that often announce, 
``You are a winner'' in bold type. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can say we believe we have an adequate amount of money to  
make sure people who have been victimized will be compensated 
fairly,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, which admitted no wrongdoing in the deal, has been  
stung by news reports of elderly people who spent thousands of 
dollars to buy magazines they thought they had to purchase in order 
to collect prizes. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem was a big enough concern that several attorneys  
general from around the country met in February in Indianapolis to 
discuss strategy and hear from victims. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jersey City, N.J.-based company already had reached  
agreements with 35 other states and the District of Columbia. Iowa 
and Washington state still have complaints pending. 
</P>
<P>
	The exact amount consumers in each state will get will be  
determined later under a formula based on the number of American 
Family customers in each state. 
</P>
<P>
	Modisett also said American Family spokesmen Ed McMahon and Dick  
Clark have agreed to donate $10,000 to charity as part of the 
settlement. Both will send the money to the Muscular Dystrophy 
Foundation.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pushes Environment Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YULEE, Fla. (AP) -- President Clinton issued three directives  
Saturday to protect miles of government-run beaches and help clean 
waterways and demanded that Congress to stop making ``sneak attacks 
on our environment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his weekly radio address delivered from a vast wildlife  
preserve, Clinton said he was directing the National Park Service 
to expand health protections along seashores managed by the federal 
government, including beaches along Cape Cod, Mass., and Cape 
Hatteras, N.C., and Point Reyes National Seashore 30 miles north of 
San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	He also told all federal agencies to adopt ``a comprehensive  
strategy to better safeguard rivers and other bodies of water on 
federal lands.'' In addition, he directed the Environmental 
Protection Agency to develop stronger ways to prevent sewage 
spills, a major cause of beach closures. Last year, 350 of 1,062 
beaches surveyed by the EPA reported closures or health advisories 
due to pollution. 
</P>
<P>
	``We often speak of building a country where our children have  
an opportunity to do even better than we've done,'' Clinton said. 
``We know our children cannot do better tomorrow if we're willing 
to squander precious environmental resources today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Environmentalists welcomed Clinton's announcement.  
</P>
<P>
	Tryg Sletteland, director of the Pacific Rivers Council in  
Portland, Ore., said the new initiative should reduce pollution of 
lakes and streams from timber cutting and cattle grazing on public 
lands. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to bring the federal agencies into better  
compliance with federal laws. This is long overdue,'' said 
Sletteland. 
</P>
<P>
	Actor Ted Danson, president of the American Oceans Campaign,  
said the new plan will help reduce beach water pollution. ``We hope 
it will set an example for state and municipal beaches,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president spoke from his vacation hideaway at White Oak  
Plantation, perched along the banks of the St. Marys River near the 
Georgia-Florida border. He and his wife, Hillary, arrived Tuesday 
and have not left the grounds, preferring to golf, ride bikes, read 
books and watch the wild animals that roam the 7,500-acre compound. 
The Clintons return Sunday to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our visit here reminds us once again what a gift it is to  
spend time outdoors, to walk among tall trees, to see wild animals 
and rare birds, to watch the sun set and the stars come out over a 
beautiful river,'' Clinton said. ``It also makes us appreciate the 
generations of Americans who fought to preserve the parklands and 
the beaches we all enjoy today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton said those efforts are being jeopardized by  
Republican congressional leaders' budget allocations, which he said 
would stall cleanups of toxic waste sites, limit access to national 
parks and weaken clean water protections. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've already seen troubling signs that Congress again will  
try to gut environmental protections by tacking provisions called 
riders on to their budget bills,'' Clinton said. ``I urge Congress 
to end these sneak attacks on our environment once and for all.''

<HEADLINE> Stewart Racing Twice in Same Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.C. (AP) -- Tony Stewart isn't the only person who's  
doing double duty this week at Lowe's Motor Speedway at Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
	While Stewart has been logging plenty of miles in his  
preparations to drive in the Indianapolis 500 and the Coca-Cola 600 
on the same day, Tony Eury Jr. has been literally pounding his 
share of pavement as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Eury, car chief for Dale Earnhardt Jr.'s entries in both  
Saturday's Carquest 300 and Sunday's Coca-Cola 600, has been 
wearing a step pedometer to monitor the distance he's walking this 
week in the garage area at Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
	There are 346 steps between the two cars in their respective  
garage areas in the track's sprawling infield. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Eury took 9,486 steps as he worked on the two  
cars, a total of 2.8 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Eury's total increased to 16,873 steps -- 5.3 miles.  
</P>
<P>
	He walked 8,219 steps, or 2.5 miles, on Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	That's 34,518 steps, or 10.6 miles, in the three days leading up  
to Saturday's 300. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, by the way, took part in both Winston Cup practice  
sessions for the 600 on Saturday, then flew to Indianapolis to stay 
overnight before his big day Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
                              *------	 
</P>
<P>
	TOTALLY RAD: A three-car alliance designed to improve  
aerodynamic performance produced some impressive qualifying results 
for the 600. All six drivers in the so-called RAD alliance earned 
starting spots in the top 15. 
</P>
<P>
	The alliance drew its name from Richard Childress Racing, Andy  
Petree Racing and Dale Earnhardt Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``The crux of what we do at RAD is perform wind-tunnel testing  
and computer simulations to develop ideas for track testing,'' said 
Louis Duncan, the group's aero engineer. ``Track testing is the 
acid test of what we do. It might work in the wind tunnel or on the 
computer, but it means nothing if it doesn't work on the track.'' 
</P>
<P>
	RAD's Kenny Wallace qualified third, Steve Park fifth, Ken  
Schrader sixth, Dale Earnhardt Jr. eighth, Mike Skinner 11th and 
Dale Earnhardt 15th. 
</P>
<P>
                              *------	 
</P>
<P>
	LOOKING BACK: The first running of the Coca-Cola 600, in 1960,  
was also the first race held at what was originally called 
Charlotte Motor Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	The race was originally scheduled for Memorial Day weekend but  
was postponed until June 19 because of construction delays. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Lee Johnson won the race by four laps over Johnny Beauchamp.  
</P>
<P>
	It was the only victory of Johnson's Winston Cup career.  
</P>
<P>
                              *------	 
</P>
<P>
	BY THE NUMBERS: Three drivers have won eight of the last 10  
Winston Cup races at Charlotte. Jeff Gordon and Dale Jarrett have 
won three each and Mark Martin has won twice. ... Dale Earnhardt 
leads all active drivers with 20 top-10 finishes at Charlotte. 
Terry Labonte is next with 18, followed by Rusty Wallace with 15 
and Mark Martin with 13. ... Dale Earnhardt has 10 top-10 finishes 
in 12 races at Charlotte. Jeff Burton has four consecutive finishes 
of eighth or better.

<HEADLINE> France Sweeps in Cycling Sprints </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRISCO, Texas (AP) -- Erin Veenstra of Colorado Springs, Colo.,  
captured the women's individual pursuit title, while France's 
Laurent Gane and Felicia Ballanger won the men's and women's match 
sprint events during the second day of competition at the EDS World 
Cup of Cycling today. 
</P>
<P>
	For Veenstra, a resident-athlete at the U.S. Olympic Training  
Center, it marked her first career international victory. A week 
ago at the World Cup season-opener in Mexico City, Veenstra placed 
seventh in the 3,000-meter individual pursuit. She looks to improve 
upon her sixth-place finish in Mexico City in the points race, 
which will be held on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was sick during last week's competition and did not ride my  
bike until this Thursday,'' said Veenstra, a sixth-place finish at 
the 1998 world championships in the points race. ``I was not on my 
bike for four days, but I felt great today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Veenstra recorded the second-fastest time in the qualifying  
round (3:42.493), less than 0.2 seconds behind Sarah Ulmer of New 
Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
	Reigning world individual pursuit champion Antonella Bellutti of  
Italy failed to finish the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Gane defeated 1996 Olympic silver medalist Marty  
Nothstein of Trexlertown, Pa., in the finals of the match sprint. 
The bronze medalist at the 1998 World Track Cycling Championships 
in Bordeaux, France, Gane swept two consecutive races to defeat 
Nothstein. 
</P>
<P>
	``With World Cups in consecutive weeks, it makes for two long  
weeks of competition, since I compete in three events. Gane had 
fresher legs, since he did not compete in Mexico City, and that may 
have been the difference,'' said Nothstein, winner of three world 
championship titles. 
</P>
<P>
	Nothstein, who finished third in the match sprint and second in  
the Keirin in Mexico City last week, will compete in the Olympic 
Sprint and Keirin on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the women's match sprint, four-time defending world champion  
Felicia Ballanger swept two successive races from Tanya Dubnicoff 
of Canada. Dubnicoff captured the sprint at the World Cup opener in 
Mexico and finished third at the '98 world championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Jennie Reed of Kirkland, Wash., was the lone U.S. entry in the  
field and finished eighth after placing fourth at last year's 
worlds. 
</P>
<P>
	In the fourth event of the night, Australia broke its own track  
record in winning the 4,000-meter team pursuit competition by 
defeating France in the finals. 
</P>
<P>
	The quartet of Graeme Brown, Nigel Grigg, Brett Lancaster, Luke  
Roberts posted a winning time of 4:10.808, eclipsing their own 
qualifying time of 4:13.482. The American squad of Adam Laurent 
(Shell Beach, Calif.), Tommy Mulkey (Winterville, Ga.), Mike 
Tillman (Lafayette, Calif.) and Christian Vande Velde (LeMont, 
Ill.) finished third by defeating New Zealand in the bronze medal 
race. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's events include the women's 500-meter time trial and  
points race, plus the men's Keirin, Olympic Sprint, points race and 
Madison.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Frustrating Majority GOP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Second-term headaches are chronic for  
presidents in their last, lame-duck years in the White House. And 
President Clinton dug the sex scandal pitfalls that made his worse. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, it is the Republican Congress that seems to be  
sputtering and defensive at this point. Not the Democrats, or the 
president who was impeached and acquitted for deceptions in the 
Monica Lewinsky sex scandal, and later held in contempt of court. 
</P>
<P>
	That would have seemed to invite an opposition Congress to seize  
the offensive and dominate the agenda. Instead, the minority 
Democrats are not only fending off GOP plans, they are getting 
their way on issues such as gun control and have the pressure on 
for measures including a minimum wage increase, patient's rights 
legislation in dealing with managed health care, possibly campaign 
finance reform. 
</P>
<P>
	Not that those measures are going to pass on Democratic terms.  
But Republicans have been outmaneuvered, especially on gun control 
measures pushed through the Senate after the Littleton, Colo., 
school shootings, with impetus added by the episode in Conyers, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
	House Republican leaders are supporting the Senate measures,  
Speaker Dennis Hastert calling them ``common sense legislation.'' 
In the Senate, it was shaped by Republican concessions and retreat. 
</P>
<P>
	There are other GOP problem issues in the House, where they have  
only a five-seat margin, and can't afford constant collisions with 
the Democrats. Conservative Republicans have been stalling House 
action on appropriations, forcing votes on minor amendments to 
press their complaint that there is no GOP strategy on an overall 
spending plan. 
</P>
<P>
	They are wary of another late-session budget contest with  
Clinton, who has fared well in prior ones -- the government shutdown 
struggle of 1995 and early 1996 boosted him politically, and he got 
$21 billion in what was labeled emergency spending in 1998, a deal 
that angered conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans intend to pass a tax cut, but it will be far less  
ambitious than the 10 percent their leaders sought. Prospects for 
long-term Social Security financing reform are fading if not gone. 
</P>
<P>
	They have passed a bill seeking deployment of a missile defense  
system, and a measure to give states more leeway in spending their 
federal education aid. 
</P>
<P>
	A GOP-pledged measure to make it more difficult for the  
government to spend Social Security surpluses was overwhelmingly 
approved. It's billed as a ``lock box'' to protect Social Security 
funds, although the legislation does leave ways to open it. 
</P>
<P>
	A week before, Congress completed, and President Clinton signed  
an emergency spending bill for the air war over Kosovo, disaster 
aid and other programs -- $13 billion out of the same surplus. 
Another $2 billion in home state projects and favors will have to 
be offset in the regular appropriations process. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton signed the measure, more than twice what the  
administration proposed, saying that he's vetoed money bills before 
and is ``fully prepared to do so again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All of this has stirred conservative complaints about lax  
leadership and a lacking agenda. That's become a target for GOP 
presidential campaigners on the right. Former Vice President Dan 
Quayle said congressional Republicans should concentrate on tax 
cuts, school choice, defense and strict spending discipline. ``This 
is our agenda and it's barely being talked about on the Hill,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the numbers put GOP dominance beyond reach. They have 55  
votes in the Senate, but it takes 60 to force action, so Democrats 
can bar the way until they get concessions. With their narrow House 
edge, they have to bargain there, too. 
</P>
<P>
	That works to Democratic advantage, and to Clinton's, despite  
his scars and the pattern of waning influence and troubles that 
have hit other presidencies at this point. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very mindful of history's difficulties and I'm going to  
try to beat them,'' Clinton said after winning his second term. 
Instead, he deepened them. And having escaped the Republicans in 
impeachment, he's still frustrating them in Congress.

<HEADLINE> McGwire Kept Out of Cubs' Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Mark McGwire was forced out of the St. Louis  
Cardinals' lineup Saturday with an infected corn on his right foot. 
</P>
<P>
	The painful condition kept baseball's single-season home run  
champ from even coming to Wrigley Field. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire was initially examined by Cubs physician Dr. John  
Marquardt and will be checked again to determine if he will be able 
to play in the series finale Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He developed a cellulitis from a soft corn he has on his right  
foot. It's in between his last two toes,'' Cardinals trainer Barry 
Weinberg said before Saturday's game, adding that McGwire will 
remain at the team hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	``It develops during the course of each season and he manages  
it, but it got infected. We got to keep him off his foot for a day 
and he's on a lot of antibiotics. We're optimistic for tomorrow and 
that's why we're keeping him in bed today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire, who hit 70 homers last season, went 0-for-4 with two  
strikeouts Friday in his first head-to-head matchup this season 
with Chicago's Sammy Sosa, who hit 66 homers a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Cardinals manager Tony La Russa said the corn had nothing to do  
with McGwire's performance. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was sore before the game up into his leg, which is the  
infection. But it wasn't anything to do with his at-bats,'' La 
Russa said. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire has 14 homers this season, including six in his previous  
nine games. 
</P>
<P>
	Eli Marrero replaced McGwire at first base.

<HEADLINE> El Salvador 2, Colombia 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Second-half substitute Vladimir  
Montes scored the tying goal and set up the game winner by Ronald 
Cerritos to lead El Salvador to a 2-1 win over Colombia in an 
exhibition game at Giants Stadium on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Hector Hurtado scored for favored Colombia, which was missing  
several of its regulars due to club commitments. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colombians came close to tying the game a handful of times  
in the final 10-15 minutes, but they were either stopped by 
goalkeeper Sergio Munoz or they missed the net with shots. 
</P>
<P>
	Frustration boiled over in injury time when several players on  
both sides entangled in a shoving match, eliciting boos and 
whistles from many in the crowd of 43,192. The Colombian players 
exited the field quickly, many failing to participate in the 
customary handshake. 
</P>
<P>
	Montes tied the game in the 47th minutes on a play that started  
with a long throw-in by Roberto Hernandez. Cerritos of the San Jose 
Clash of the MLS flicked the ball with his head in the penalty area 
and Montes scissor-kicked the ball past goalkeeper Agustin Julio. 
</P>
<P>
	The game-winner came in the 63rd minute when Nelson Flores sent  
a long ball from the left wing across the area to the end line. 
Montes leaped to head the ball back into play and Cerritos ran onto 
it, slamming it into the back of the net. Agustin never had a 
chance. 
</P>
<P>
	Colombia dominated play in the first half and El Salvador was  
lucky to be trailing only 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurtado scored for the Colombians in the 24th minute, but they  
had at least three other good scoring opportunities. The best one 
came just at the start of injury time when Fredy Grisales dribbled 
past two defenders in the penalty box, then put his shot just wide 
of the far post with Munoz at his mercy. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurtado's goal came on a shot that bounced off the far post and  
into the net. It was set up when he ran onto a through ball and 
chipped it over a sliding Munoz.

<HEADLINE> Discovery Docks With Space Station </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) -- In another milestone for the new  
international space station, shuttle Discovery docked with the 
outpost early today for six days of activities that include a 
spacewalk, repair work and supply transfers. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've made the first docking with space station look  
effortless, and you've set the standard for all those who follow,'' 
Mission Control told Discovery's astronauts after they successfully 
linked the two spacecraft at 12:24 a.m. EDT. 
</P>
<P>
	With shuttle commander Kent Rominger at the controls, Discovery  
pulled up and latched on to the space station as it soared 240 
miles above the border of Russia and Kazakstan. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have capture!'' exclaimed Rominger.  
</P>
<P>
	The seven-member crew is the first to journey to the outpost  
since December, when astronauts delivered an American module and 
joined it with a Russian component already in orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been six months since anyone came to visit,'' Mission  
Control said. ``Welcome aboard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole station looks beautiful, and we're happy to be  
visiting,'' replied astronaut Daniel Barry. 
</P>
<P>
	The astronauts entered an outer chamber of the station this  
morning to collect air samples. To get things ready, ground 
controllers cranked up the heat toward room temperature. Normally, 
the station is about 25 degrees when no one is there. 
</P>
<P>
	The crew will venture all the way inside the outpost for the  
first time Sunday, when they begin their maintenance work and start 
transferring two tons of supplies into the station. 
</P>
<P>
	Before that, Barry and astronaut Tamara Jernigan were to perform  
a spacewalk starting late tonight to attach tool bags and cranes to 
the outside of the station. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the gear to be left inside are computers, tools, water and  
clothes for the station's first permanent inhabitants, who are 
supposed to move in next March. Their arrival has been delayed 
because of the Russians' inability to complete a component that 
will double as living quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the absence of the Russian component -- it should have  
gone up last year -- Saturday's docking had to be revamped. 
</P>
<P>
	Engineers devised a plan in which the station's large thrusters  
were turned off and small thrusters were used to hold the station 
steady during Discovery's slow and cautious approach Friday night. 
The moment the docking rings on the two spacecraft touched, Russian 
controllers sent a command to shut down all of the station 
thrusters. 
</P>
<P>
	Space shuttles have docked nine times with Russia's Mir station  
in recent years. But this marked the first time since Skylab in the 
mid-1970s that NASA docked with its own space station.

<HEADLINE> Envoy Says Peace Talks Progressed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A Russian envoy says he made enough  
progress in talks with Slobodan Milosevic to be virtually certain 
of returning to Yugoslavia next week for a new round. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's Viktor Chernomyrdin wrapped up nine hours of  
face-to-face talks with Milosevic on Friday, declaring that the 
Yugoslav president was the key to a Kosovo peace plan despite his 
indictment for war crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours after the talks, NATO unleashed another wave of airstrikes  
targeting Yugoslavia's power supply system. Local media reported 
that intense NATO attacks early today caused a massive power 
outage, extensive damage in several towns and injuries to four 
civilians. 
</P>
<P>
	Chernomyrdin again urged a pause in NATO's bombing campaign to  
give peace talks a chance, and said he was ``very satisfied'' with 
the talks despite no signs of a breakthrough, Russia's ITAR-Tass 
news agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	A source close to the Yugoslav government also called the  
outcome of the talks ``positive,'' but did not elaborate. 
Milosevic, however, gave little sign he was ready to meet NATO 
demands. 
</P>
<P>
	His office issued a statement reiterating that Yugoslavia  
accepts the general principles of a plan sketched out in early May 
by Russia and the world's top seven industrialized countries, the 
statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	It added that it wants the U.N. Security Council to be empowered  
to handle ``the entire problem'' -- a phrase that indicates 
Milosevic may be more willing than before to accept a Security 
Council agreement to end the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia and China have vetoes in the council and are unlikely to  
accept anything vehemently opposed by Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	Western nations have rejected a similar offer from Milosevic  
because he would not agree to aspects of the plan calling for a 
total withdrawal of Serb forces from Kosovo and the deployment of a 
well-armed international security force. 
</P>
<P>
	Chernomyrdin said Russian military experts traveling with him  
had discussed with their Yugoslav counterparts conditions of a 
pullout of Yugoslav army and police troops from Kosovo and the 
introduction of an international contingent under the U.N. flag. 
</P>
<P>
	In talks in Moscow today, Chernomyrdin is expected to brief two  
other key envoys in the crisis -- Finnish President Martti 
Ahtisaari, the European Union representative, and Strobe Talbott, 
the deputy U.S. secretary of state. 
</P>
<P>
	But as Chernomyrdin left, NATO jets hit hard on Yugoslavia's  
power supply system and on suspected military and other targets. 
</P>
<P>
	Power plants Drmno, 40 miles east of Belgrade, and Bajina Basta  
in the west of the country were hit shortly after midnight, radio 
stations Studio B and Pancevo reported. Much of Serbia was left 
without electricity. 
</P>
<P>
	In Novi Sad, the second-largest city, missiles struck near the  
already wrecked building of state-run Serbian television. Several 
nearby private homes were badly damaged and two civilians were 
hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
	In the town of Cuprija, 75 miles southeast of Belgrade, NATO  
missiles struck the city center in a pre-dawn attack, the private 
Beta news agency reported. Two people were injured. 
</P>
<P>
	The official Tanjug news agency reported six powerful explosions  
northwest of Belgrade, on Mount Fruska Gora and near the town of 
Sremska Mitrovica. Batajnica military airfield, a frequent NATO 
target just outside Belgrade, was also hit. 
</P>
<P>
	More NATO attacks were reported in Kosovo, a province in Serbia,  
the dominant republic of Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	A Serb army commander for the province, Maj. Gen. Vladimir  
Lazarevic, accused NATO of siding with the independence-minded 
Kosovo Liberation Army, Beta reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Lazarevic lambasted the alliance for ``directly assisting  
efforts by armed groups of (ethnic) Albanian terrorists to 
penetrate Yugoslav territory,'' from neighboring Albania, and 
described the attempts as ``a new phase of aggression'' against 
Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of refugees, meanwhile, poured into Albania despite  
fighting between Serb forces and the KLA along the border. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 450 ethnic Albanians entered at the main Morini border  
crossing from Kosovo on Friday, according to the Organization for 
Security and Cooperation in Europe.

<HEADLINE> Morgan Misses Start for Texas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Texas Rangers right-hander Mike Morgan  
missed tonight's scheduled start against the Minnesota Twins with 
swelling in his right shin. 
</P>
<P>
	Morgan was replaced by John Burkett, making his first start  
since May 17. Burkett had been moved to the bullpen after going 0-3 
in his first five starts. 
</P>
<P>
	The swelling in Morgan's shin is related to an injury suffered  
on April 29 when he was hit in the leg by a line drive off the bat 
of Derek Jeter of the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers also scratched left fielder Rusty Greer from  
Saturday night's lineup with a sore right shoulder. Greer incurred 
the injury on a slide into second base during Friday night's 
victory over Minnesota.

<HEADLINE> Coca-Cola Wants Class-Action Denied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Trying to stop 1,500 black employees from being  
included in a discrimination lawsuit, Coca-Cola Co. on Friday asked 
a federal judge to deny the suit class-action status. 
</P>
<P>
	Four black employees sued the soft-drink giant last month,  
saying Coca-Cola discriminates against blacks in pay, promotions, 
performance evaluations and firings. The company denies the 
allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs are seeking class-action status for the suit,  
which would add as plaintiffs all 1,500 salaried black employees 
who work for the company nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Coke's attorneys filed a motion Friday asking U.S. District  
Judge Richard Story to dismiss any class-action claims. 
</P>
<P>
	``Despite ... general references to discriminatory practices,  
the named plaintiffs' and prospective class members' claims have 
virtually no commonality, other than the race of their 
proponents,'' the motion said.

<HEADLINE> Javelin Critically Injures Athlete </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TACOMA, Wash. (AP) -- A high school javelin thrower was  
critically injured when he was struck in the head with a javelin 
during warmups at the state Class 4A-3A boys and girls track and 
field meet Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	James Phillips, 17, a junior at Marysville-Pilchuck High School,  
was taken to the Madigan Army Medical Center at nearby Fort Lewis, 
where he underwent surgery, said Lt. Ryan Laughlin, administrative 
officer of the day at Madigan. Phillips was listed in critical 
condition with a skull fracture and internal bleeding in his 
cranium Saturday night, Laughlin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Marcos Bolanos, a senior at Cascade High School in Everett,  
threw the javelin that struck Phillips when both were lofting short 
throws before the competition. After the accident, Bolanos competed 
in the meet and finished fourth in the javelin. 
</P>
<P>
	Bolanos' teammate, Ryan Bekins, said he witnessed the accident.  
</P>
<P>
	``They were tossing (the javelin) back and forth and the  
Marysville kid (Phillips) was standing there looking back,'' Bekins 
said. ``Marcos said, 'Look out' and tossed it. Marcos saw he 
(Phillips) wasn't moving so he yelled, 'Heads up' and it (the 
javelin) grazed him in the head.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meet manager Joe Bullock said the usual safeguards for the event  
were in place. Washington state requires rubber tips to be used on 
javelins in competition, and Bullock said the javelin that hit 
Phillips did have a rubber tip. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just simply one of those situations where an  
unfortunate accident occurred,'' Bullock said.

<HEADLINE> Fusion 2, Mutiny 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- The Miami Fusion, behind goals by  
Diego Serna and Henry Gutierrez, snapped a five-game losing streak 
tonight with a 2-1 victory over the Tampa Bay Mutiny. 
</P>
<P>
	Tampa Bay (5-5, 9 points) had its five-game winning streak  
snapped as it suffered its first loss since acquiring Carlos 
Valderrama from the Fusion on April 23. 
</P>
<P>
	The win moved the Fusion (4-8, 8 points) into a three-way tie  
with New England and New York/New Jersey for fourth place in Major 
League Soccer's Eastern Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Valderrama received an ovation from Fusion fans during pregame  
introductions. He was booed, though, in the 37th minute after 
receiving a yellow card for blatantly elbowing Serna as the two 
went for a ball near midfield. 
</P>
<P>
	Serna opened the scoring in the 22nd minute, when he headed a  
Gutierrez cross past Mutiny goalkeeper Andy Kirk. The goal gave the 
Fusion its first lead in a game since a 1-0 win over Kansas City on 
April 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Serna now has scored a goal in four straight games and has seven  
on the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Gutierrez gave the Fusion a 2-0 lead in the 56th minute with a  
penalty kick goal. Referee Brian Hall awarded the penalty after 
Tampa Bay defender Dominic Kinnear fouled Fusion forward Mickey 
Trotman as he jumped for a Serna cross. 
</P>
<P>
	Valderrama made it 2-1 in the 58th minute with a header on a  
Steve Ralston cross. The goal, Valderrama's first with the Mutiny, 
snapped a 271-minute scoreless streak for Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	Kinnear nearly equalized in the 68th minute with a shot from 22  
yards that forced a diving save from Miami goalkeeper Jeff Cassar. 
A minute later, Mauricio Ramos hit the post from 25 yards.

<HEADLINE> Wheel Tethers Work Fine at Motorola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADISON, Ill. (AP) -- So far, so good for CART's new wheel  
tethers. 
</P>
<P>
	Robby Gordon was the guinea pig for the new safety measure  
designed to prevent fan injuries in the stands, when his car spun 
out at the bottom of turn 3 in the 11th lap of Saturday's Motorola 
300. The left front tire was knocked loose in the resulting 
collision, but it the tether helped keep it from flying off. 
</P>
<P>
	The first test was also the first in a series of successes as  
the tethers held fast all day. When Patrick Carpentier and Bryan 
Herta got sandwiched in turn 1 and ended up in the wall, in fact, 
nothing came loose. 
</P>
<P>
	``It appeared like the tethers did the job and kept things close  
to the car,'' said team owner John Menard. ``We're just very 
unhappy we had to be the first guys to test them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon thought so, too.  
</P>
<P>
	``It didn't seem like it hurt our crash,'' he said. ``I think  
it'll be a good thing for the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tethers were added in the wake of a crash during an Indy  
Racing League event on May 1 in Concord, N.C., where three fans 
were killed and eight injured by a wheel and suspension parts. 
</P>
<P>
	As for Gordon's future, he bruised his right calf but expects to  
compete in the second half of his weekend double Sunday in the 
Indianapolis 500. He pronounced himself good to go after a 
less-than-strenuous test shortly after the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	``I drove my golf cart back from the medical trailer to our  
garage, so I guess that means I'm fine,'' Gordon said. ``The bigger 
issue for me is trying to figure out what happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon is one of three drivers attempting doubles this weekend,  
with Roberto Moreno also running Motorola and Indy. Moreno, subbing 
for Mark Blundell on Saturday, was fourth. Tony Stewart plans on 
running both Indy and the NASCAR Coca-Cola 500 the same day. 
</P>
<P>
                              *------	 
</P>
<P>
	WHAT TEAMWORK?: For the second straight year, Team Kool Green  
drivers Paul Tracy and Dario Franchitti tangled. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the two knocked each other out on the first lap. This  
time, Tracy cut Franchitti off after Franchitti tried to pass on 
the inside in turn 1 on the 147th lap. Tracy spun into the wall, 
but Franchitti somehow escaped damage after their wheels touched. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, Tracy was second and Franchitti was third. Somehow,  
team owner Barry Green didn't sound incensed about it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one of those racing incidents,'' Green said. ``The two of  
them got together and just touched. It's too bad, because they were 
both running well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for the drivers involved, Tracy's initial reaction: ``Well,  
I'm not very happy right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Franchitti, who recovered and finished third, said avoiding  
contact with the wall or another car was perhaps his greatest 
driving feat. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly, it was the worst slide I've ever been in without  
hitting something solid,'' Franchitti said. ``We'll sort it out 
tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
                              *------	 
</P>
<P>
	PIT PERILS: A member of Gil de Ferran's pit crew had a rough day  
on the job. David Stephens sustained a concussion when an air gun 
popped off a wheel and smacked him in the head hard enough to crack 
his helmet during a pit stop on lap 36. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephens was conscious when he was air-lifted to Saint Louis  
University Hospital in St. Louis for a CAT scan. 
</P>
<P>
	In conventional injury news:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Patrick Carpentier, who was knocked out of the race along with  
Bryan Herta on lap 114, complained of neck pain and was taken for 
precautionary X-rays. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Tarso Marques spun and hit the wall in turn 4 on lap 32. He  
left the car under his own power but was subsequently air-lifted to 
Saint Louis University Hospital for a precautionary CAT scan. 
</P>
<P>
                              *------	 
</P>
<P>
	BRIEFLY: Christian Fittipaldi, who finished ninth, is the only  
CART driver to complete every lap in the season's first six races. 
Fittipaldi is Andretti's teammate on the Newman-Haas racing team. 
... Herta on getting squeezed and knocked out of the race when four 
cars entered turn 1 on lap 114: ``I saw a green car dive-bomb 
underneath me. The next thing I knew, I was sideways and into the 
wall.'' ... Andretti has led for 290 laps, or 40.5 percent, the 
first three years of the Motorola 300. ... Gateway International 
added about 20,000 seats for a capacity of 70,000, but the stands 
were only about half full. The major reason probably is that 
Indianapolis is only 250 miles east.

<HEADLINE> NASCAR Team Owner Dies At 54 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GAYLORD, Mich. (AP) -- Harry Melling, president of Melling Tool  
Co. and owner of the NASCAR team on which Bill Elliott enjoyed his 
greatest success, died Saturday. He was 54. 
</P>
<P>
	Melling suffered a heart attack at his home Saturday morning and  
was taken to Otsego Memorial Hospital in Gaylord. 
</P>
<P>
	``My dad loved racing,'' said Mark Melling, vice president and  
general manager of Melling Racing, told The Jackson (Mich.) Citizen 
Patriot. ``He met so many wonderful people over the years. Prayers 
from the competitors and the fans would mean so much to my family 
right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Melling was in Charlotte, N.C., where the team was  
preparing for Sunday's Coca Cola 600 race. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is very shocking, very tragic, and very sad, not only for  
racing, but for the Jackson community and Harry's family,'' said 
Gene Haskett, president of Michigan Speedway. ``It's just a sad 
situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harry Melling was in his 20th year of NASCAR Winston Cup Racing.  
Melling Racing won the Winston Cup points championship with Elliott 
behind the wheel in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	Three years earlier, Melling's team won a then-record $1 million  
bonus -- the Winston Million -- from R.J. Reynolds for winning three 
of the four major races on the Winston Cup schedule that year -- the 
Daytona 500, the Winston 500 and the Southern 500. 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott drove for the team from 1981-92, getting 34 of his 40  
career victories. 
</P>
<P>
	Melling started in Winston Cup racing as first an associate and  
then a primary sponsor for driver Benny Parsons in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	Winston Cup Scene, the leading publication covering stock car  
racing, in 1997 named Melling one of the 40 most important people 
in NASCAR history. 
</P>
<P>
	Melling was the grandson of George Melling Sr., who founded  
Melling Tool in Jackson, in 1944. The firm grew to become a leading 
supplier of oil pumps. The business also makes and distributes 
other automotive products, such as gears, sprockets and camshafts. 
</P>
<P>
	Harry Melling, who graduated from Ferris State University with a  
degree in business, was elected president of Melling Tool in 
September 1975. He succeeded his father, Benjamin Melling. 
</P>
<P>
	Melling had interests outside of his job as president of Melling  
Tool in Jackson. In 1983, he purchased Sylvan Ski Resort in 
Gaylord. He turned it into a year-round travel destination by 
adding golf courses designed by Robert Trent Jones and Tom Fazio 
and renamed it Treetops Sylvan Resort. He later added another 
course. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1975, the firm of Ray Greene and Co., which made Rebel  
sailing boats, went bankrupt. Melling led a group of investors that 
took over the firm and ran it under the Melling Tool banner. 
</P>
<P>
	Funeral arrangements have not been announced.  
</P>
<P>
	Melling is survived by his widow, Christine, sons Mark and  
Matthew, and daughter Michelle. All are involved in the operations 
of Melling Tool and the racing team.

	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Brazil's top drug authority says  
Colombian cartels are using native people in the Amazon jungle to 
transport drugs, a newspaper reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Anti-drug Secretary Walter Maierovitch said Indians carry drugs  
from Brazil to refineries in Colombia, the Jornal do Brasil 
newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Maierovitch spoke at a meeting this week between Brazilian and  
Colombian authorities to discuss drug-trafficking in the Amazon, 
the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials drew up a report that will be the basis for an  
agreement on combatting trafficking to be signed in July. Peru also 
will be asked to sign. The report called Brazil's border region 
lawless, blaming a failure by authorities to promote economic and 
social development, the daily said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil is installing a $1.2 billion Amazon Surveillance System,  
which uses radar and aircraft to combat trafficking, as well as 
forest burning and illegal gold mining.

	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- President Andres Pastrana appointed a  
former running mate as defense minister Saturday, filling a spot 
left empty this week by a resignation that highlighted military 
reservations about peace talks with leftist rebels. 
</P>
<P>
	Luis Fernando Ramirez, 40, who was the Conservative Party's  
vice-presidential candidate during Pastrana's unsuccessful 1994 bid 
for the presidency, will replace Rodrigo Lloreda, the presidential 
press office announced. 
</P>
<P>
	Lloreda said he resigned to protest Pastrana's refusal to put  
time limits on a military evacuation of a southern region where 
peace talks began in January with Colombia's most powerful 
guerrilla group. 
</P>
<P>
	Army officials say the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia  
are exploiting the situation to step up military preparations. 
</P>
<P>
	Pastrana's government maintains the troop pullout is a necessary  
concession to facilitate negotiations to end the 35-year armed 
conflict, which has left tens of thousands dead.

<P>
	Wright died at his home in Vitoria, 315 miles northeast of Rio,  
TV Globo reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Together with Roman Catholic Cardinal Paulo Evaristo Arns, the  
former archbishop of Sao Paulo, Wright campaigned against violence 
and torture by the armed forces and led the project ``Brazil No 
More,'' which revealed the names of victims and torturers. 
</P>
<P>
	The military tried unsuccessfully to suppress the project, which  
won praise from the human rights group Amnesty International. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Discovery Docks With Space Station </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- With their flawless docking behind  
them, Discovery's astronauts went on a spacewalk late tonight to 
spruce up the outside of the new international space station. 
</P>
<P>
	Tamara Jernigan and Dr. Daniel Barry floated out of the space  
shuttle around 11 p.m. The seven-story-plus station loomed above 
them, jutting straight out of Discovery's cargo bay. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unbelievable!'' Jernigan said as she unlocked the hatch.  
</P>
<P>
	Among their duties during the six-hour outing: attaching a pair  
of 5-foot cranes to the exterior of the station, hanging out three 
bags of tools for future spacewalkers, installing a glare-reducing 
shroud over a docking target, and covering an exposed pin. 
</P>
<P>
	The spacewalk was expected to last into the wee hours of Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
	No one was there to greet the seven shuttle astronauts when they  
arrived early Saturday -- the first residents don't move in until 
March. So Mission Control extended an ultralong-distance welcome. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been six months since anyone came to visit,'' Mission  
Control radioed up. ``Welcome aboard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole station looks beautiful, and we're happy to be  
visiting,'' replied Barry. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first of dozens of shuttle dockings expected for the  
space station, launched in two pieces late last year. Mission 
Control was delighted with the way everything went. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've made the first docking with space station look  
effortless, and you've set the standard for all those who follow,'' 
Mission Control told commander Kent Rominger, a Navy pilot who 
guided Discovery in. 
</P>
<P>
	The first order of business involved opening the outermost hatch  
of the space station and ducking a few feet inside to take air 
samples and do a little rearranging. The hatch was then closed; it 
won't be opened again until Sunday night, when the crew ventures 
all the way in. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA wanted the doors between the two spacecraft sealed in case  
there was an emergency during Saturday night's spacewalk. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though the plan called for Jernigan and Barry to attach  
themselves with double safety lines to the spacecraft at all times, 
and even though their spacesuits had jet packs, neither the 
National Aeronautics and Space Administration nor Rominger was 
taking any chances. 
</P>
<P>
	Rominger said before the flight that if one of the spacewalkers  
got loose and floated away, he'd ditch the station and chase after 
the astronaut. 
</P>
<P>
	Jernigan was a little anxious, but not because of any fear of  
snapped tethers. 
</P>
<P>
	During her last shuttle flight in 1996, a loose screw caused the  
hatch to jam, and her spacewalk was canceled. Workers at Kennedy 
Space Center promised her it wouldn't happen again. 
</P>
<P>
	Discovery will remain docked to the 77-foot, 70,000-pound space  
station until Thursday night. Between now and then, the astronauts 
will lug nearly 4,000 pounds of gear into the station. 
</P>
<P>
	During the last station-assembly flight, astronauts took up an  
American-made component and connected it to a Russian-built control 
module that was already in orbit. Problems have since popped up 
with some of the electronics, so Discovery's crew will spend time 
making repairs.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Frustrating Majority GOP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Second-term headaches are chronic for  
presidents in their last, lame-duck years in the White House. And 
President Clinton dug the sex scandal pitfalls that made his worse. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, it is the Republican Congress that seems to be  
sputtering and defensive at this point. Not the Democrats, or the 
president who was impeached and acquitted for deceptions in the 
Monica Lewinsky sex scandal, and later held in contempt of court. 
</P>
<P>
	That would have seemed to invite an opposition Congress to seize  
the offensive and dominate the agenda. Instead, the minority 
Democrats are not only fending off GOP plans, they are getting 
their way on issues such as gun control and have the pressure on 
for measures including a minimum wage increase, patient's rights 
legislation in dealing with managed health care, possibly campaign 
finance reform. 
</P>
<P>
	Not that those measures are going to pass on Democratic terms.  
But Republicans have been outmaneuvered, especially on gun control 
measures pushed through the Senate after the Littleton, Colo., 
school shootings, with impetus added by the episode in Conyers, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
	House Republican leaders are supporting the Senate measures,  
Speaker Dennis Hastert calling them ``common sense legislation.'' 
In the Senate, it was shaped by Republican concessions and retreat. 
</P>
<P>
	There are other GOP problem issues in the House, where they have  
only a five-seat margin, and can't afford constant collisions with 
the Democrats. Conservative Republicans have been stalling House 
action on appropriations, forcing votes on minor amendments to 
press their complaint that there is no GOP strategy on an overall 
spending plan. 
</P>
<P>
	They are wary of another late-session budget contest with  
Clinton, who has fared well in prior ones -- the government shutdown 
struggle of 1995 and early 1996 boosted him politically, and he got 
$21 billion in what was labeled emergency spending in 1998, a deal 
that angered conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans intend to pass a tax cut, but it will be far less  
ambitious than the 10 percent their leaders sought. Prospects for 
long-term Social Security financing reform are fading if not gone. 
</P>
<P>
	They have passed a bill seeking deployment of a missile defense  
system, and a measure to give states more leeway in spending their 
federal education aid. 
</P>
<P>
	A GOP-pledged measure to make it more difficult for the  
government to spend Social Security surpluses was overwhelmingly 
approved. It's billed as a ``lock box'' to protect Social Security 
funds, although the legislation does leave ways to open it. 
</P>
<P>
	A week before, Congress completed, and President Clinton signed  
an emergency spending bill for the air war over Kosovo, disaster 
aid and other programs -- $13 billion out of the same surplus. 
Another $2 billion in home state projects and favors will have to 
be offset in the regular appropriations process. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton signed the measure, more than twice what the  
administration proposed, saying that he's vetoed money bills before 
and is ``fully prepared to do so again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All of this has stirred conservative complaints about lax  
leadership and a lacking agenda. That's become a target for GOP 
presidential campaigners on the right. Former Vice President Dan 
Quayle said congressional Republicans should concentrate on tax 
cuts, school choice, defense and strict spending discipline. ``This 
is our agenda and it's barely being talked about on the Hill,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the numbers put GOP dominance beyond reach. They have 55  
votes in the Senate, but it takes 60 to force action, so Democrats 
can bar the way until they get concessions. With their narrow House 
edge, they have to bargain there, too. 
</P>
<P>
	That works to Democratic advantage, and to Clinton's, despite  
his scars and the pattern of waning influence and troubles that 
have hit other presidencies at this point. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very mindful of history's difficulties and I'm going to  
try to beat them,'' Clinton said after winning his second term. 
Instead, he deepened them. And having escaped the Republicans in 
impeachment, he's still frustrating them in Congress.

<HEADLINE> Strike Could Stall Auto Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) -- Just minutes before James Hoffa entered  
the final days of negotiations to avert a Teamsters strike against 
17 trucking companies that haul cars to dealers' showrooms, he 
refused to rule out the possibility of a strike. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unless we can talk some sense into the heads of management, we  
have to shut the industry down. That's the classic idea of the only 
power we have,'' Hoffa said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiators face a deadline of 12:01 a.m. Tuesday, when the  
contract expires. Earlier this month, the truckers authorized their 
negotiating committee to call a strike if talks fail. 
</P>
<P>
	The showdown is Hoffa's first test since he became president of  
the Teamsters in March, assuming a post once held by his late 
father, Jimmy Hoffa. This is James Hoffa's first negotiation as 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	Ian Hunter said today it was too soon to talk about a strike.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think both parties are committed to finding a resolution.  
This is just typical collective bargaining, rhetoric aside,'' he 
said today as he entered the room for his first round of talks with 
Hoffa. 
</P>
<P>
	A strike could throw a roadblock in front of the auto industry's  
record sales pace. So far this year, U.S. sales of new cars and 
light trucks are up 9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Teamsters contract covers about 12,000 drivers, mechanics,  
yard and office workers nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	If a strike were called, industry officials expect the Teamsters  
initially would target just one of the major trucking companies 
that contract with automakers to move new cars to dealers from 
assembly plants, ports and rail yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Teamsters spokesman Chip Roth said Friday that the union could  
choose to strike some or all of the 17 trucking companies that are 
at the negotiating table. 
</P>
<P>
	The Teamsters are seeking higher wages, improved pensions and  
health care, and a reduction in ``excessive work hours.'' They also 
are resisting proposals to pay lower salaries to entry-level 
drivers. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Hunter said, automakers are pressing for lower prices  
from car haulers; labor costs have gone up 33 percent in the past 
four years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our drivers are the highest paid in the trucking industry,''  
Hunter said. ``The average driver wage last year was $68,000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Automakers likely would use their own drivers and hire  
independents to help get some vehicles to dealers in the event of a 
strike. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're monitoring the situation closely,'' said Ford Motor Co.  
spokesman Ron Iori. ``We're hoping both the Teamsters and the 
haulers can reach a mutually agreeable situation.''

<HEADLINE> Sydney Ticket Offer Opens at Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Australians received their first  
opportunity to buy a seat at the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games on 
Sunday when five million of the 9.6 million tickets went on sale. 
</P>
<P>
	The first of millions of copies of the Official Olympic Games  
Ticket Book was sent out with Sunday newspapers across the country. 
Buyers have 48 days to return order forms with full payment. 
</P>
<P>
	Ticket sales will give Sydney Olympic organizers a strong  
indication whether the International Olympic Committee corruption 
scandals have curtailed interest in next year's Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Popular events such as the opening and closing ceremonies,  
swimming finals and some track and field, gymnastics and basketball 
sessions are expected to be oversubscribed, with a random ballot 
used to decide who gets tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	The ticket books, inserted in News Ltd. newspapers under a  
sponsorship deal, are 52 pages long, including a day-by-day 
program, venue map and transport guides. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices range from $12.35 at sports such as rowing and baseball  
to $900 for the best seats at the opening and closing ceremonies. 
Seventy percent of all tickets will cost less than $39 and SOCOG 
aims to make $390 million from sales.

<HEADLINE> Seniors Put Shooting Behind Them </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONYERS, Ga. (AP) -- Nine days ago, students at Heritage High  
School frantically looked for escape routes when a classmate opened 
fire and wounded six people. 
</P>
<P>
	But during graduation ceremonies Friday, seniors at the school  
gratefully looked forward to their future -- and a trip to the 
tropics. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still have that nervous feeling walking up to the stage  
just like every grad has anywhere,'' said Kevin Lowe, 18, who 
planned to join his fellow seniors at next week's class trip to 
Cancun, Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	After getting their diplomas, the graduates held an impromptu  
and unprecedented group hug, an emotional release for students who 
survived a shooting spree one month after 15 people died in the 
Colorado massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	Security was tight for the event, and media access was limited  
at the request of parents and students who wished to focus on the 
seniors' accomplishments and not the May 20 shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	After the ceremony, the seniors gathered in the same commons  
area where the shooting took place, gave cheers and danced for 
several minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``This brought them all together,'' said school counselor Steven  
Brown. ``They bounced back real quick and they didn't let it faze 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All six students who were injured in the attack were released  
from the hospital after being treated for gunshot wounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspect, T.J. Solomon, 15, faces 20 counts of aggravated  
assault, cruelty to children and weapons charges. District Attorney 
Richard Read has said he will seek to try Solomon as an adult. 
</P>
<P>
	Only salutatorian Shaffiq Welji referred to the incident in his  
speech. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the last eight days, Heritage has been known worldwide for  
a single incident -- a tragedy,'' Welji said to a capacity crowd in 
the school gymnasium. ``My 13 years of schooling, however, have 
made me look at that day's events as a single occurrence, minuscule 
in comparison to the achievements of our class of 1999.''

<HEADLINE> Hoffa Leads Talks As Walkout Looms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) -- Talks to avert a Teamsters strike against  
companies that haul new cars to dealers ended Saturday with little 
progress. Union President James P. Hoffa warned drivers are ready 
to walk when their contract expires at 12:01 a.m. EDT Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we have to call a strike, we will,'' Hoffa said before 4 1/2  
hours of closed-door bargaining failed to resolve the key issues. 
``Unless we can talk some sense into the heads of management, 
that's the only recourse a union has.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The talks were to resume Sunday, again at a Virginia hotel near  
the union's Washington headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	The chief management negotiator agreed that many matters were  
unresolved. But Ian Hunter of the National Automobile Transporters 
Association added, ``There's no need to be concerned yet. This is 
typical collective bargaining, rhetoric aside.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The negotiations are an early test of Hoffa's leadership of the  
union once led by his late father, Jimmy Hoffa, before the elder 
Hoffa was sent to prison in 1967 for jury-tampering and fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	James P. Hoffa, a labor lawyer, took over in March, winning an  
election held after a campaign finance scandal had ousted the 
incumbent. Hoffa joined the car-hauling talks for the first time 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Teamsters contract covering about 12,000 drivers, mechanics,  
yard and office workers nationwide expires at 12:01 a.m. EDT 
Tuesday. Union members earlier this month authorized their 
negotiating team to call a strike if talks failed. 
</P>
<P>
	In this robust economy, a Teamster strike of more than a few  
days could put a dent in auto sales on pace for record this year. 
The big-rig drivers move 95 percent of new cars to the nation's 
showrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	The union could target one or all of the 17 major trucking  
companies that contract with automakers to move new cars to dealers 
from assembly plants, ports and rail yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Automakers have said they would use their own drivers and hire  
independents to help get some vehicles to dealers in the event of a 
strike. 
</P>
<P>
	The sticking point appears to be an industry proposal for a  
wage-scale giving entry-level drivers lower salaries. 
</P>
<P>
	``We could never tolerate a two-tier pay scale. That's a  
strikeable issue,'' Hoffa said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not afraid of a strike because our people have been  
working hard and I know that the industry is making record profits. 
There's never been a better time for us to get our piece of the 
pie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Teamsters also want better pensions and health care, higher wage  
increases than management is offering and fewer hours on the job. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffa has promised members major pension breakthroughs in this  
contract, said Ken Paff of Teamsters for a Democratic Union, the 
group that supported Hoffa's opponent in the last election. 
</P>
<P>
	``In that sense, it's being watched nationally,'' Paff said.  
</P>
<P>
	Hoffa would not discuss details of any strike plan.  
</P>
<P>
	Car haulers say Teamsters are the highest-paid truckers at  
$68,000 on average. On Friday, the companies released a study 
concluding that labor costs are rising faster than what the hauling 
companies can charge automakers. Labor costs have gone up 33 
percent in the past four years, the report said.

<HEADLINE> MCI WorldCom Buying SkyTel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Days after MCI WorldCom Inc. shot down rumors it  
was planning to buy pager company Skytel Communications Inc., it 
did just that, announcing a $1.3 billion stock acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's No. 2 long-distance phone company will pay stock  
worth $21.24 for each share of SkyTel, filling a gaping wireless 
hole in an otherwise broad list of telecommunications businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom, a major owner of the circuitry that makes up the  
Internet, will also absorb about $525 million in debt from SkyTel, 
which is one of the few profitable companies in the paging 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, shares of SkyTel shot higher after an Internet  
service named Company Sleuth reported that MCI WorldCom had 
reserved the Web site domain name ``skytelworldcom.com.'' 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom quickly played down the significance of that move,  
saying it routinely reserves domain names that might have value, 
and that the registration for the SkyTel-related name was the work 
of an overzealous employee. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement announced Friday comes amid a frenzy of  
deal-making that's reshaping the communications industry, with 
phone companies like Bell Atlantic and GTE merging and AT&AMP;T 
spending about $100 billion on cable TV properties it plans to use 
for phone calls and Internet access. 
</P>
<P>
	For MCI WorldCom, the SkyTel deal comes after two failed  
attempts to buy its way into the $33 billion wireless 
communications industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Just weeks ago, talks to acquire Nextel Communications, the  
largest independent wireless company, unraveled after the companies 
failed to agree on price. In January, MCI WorldCom dropped out of a 
bidding war to buy AirTouch Communications. 
</P>
<P>
	``We see a lot of opportunity for growth in the overall wireless  
market, and over time, we expect to be a broader participant in 
that market,'' said Frank Walter, a spokesman for MCI WorldCom. 
</P>
<P>
	SkyTel and MCI WorldCom, both based in Mississippi, have  
long-standing business ties. MCI WorldCom is the largest reseller 
of the SkyTel's messaging services. 
</P>
<P>
	SkyTel, with about 1.6 million customers, has been a leader in  
the move toward two-way pagers that enable customers to exchange 
messages directly with other pagers or via the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, expected to be completed in six to nine months, was  
announced after the close of financial markets Friday. Shares of 
SkyTel rose $1 to $20.31 1/4, while shares of MCI WorldCom rose $1.43 3/4 
a share to $86.37 1/2, both on the Nasdaq Stock Market.

<HEADLINE>  Discovery Docks With Space Station </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) -- In another milestone for the new  
international space station, shuttle Discovery docked with the 
outpost early today for six days of activities that include a 
spacewalk, repair work and supply transfers. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've made the first docking with space station look  
effortless, and you've set the standard for all those who follow,'' 
Mission Control told Discovery's astronauts after they successfully 
linked the two spacecraft at 12:24 a.m. EDT. 
</P>
<P>
	With shuttle commander Kent Rominger at the controls, Discovery  
pulled up and latched on to the space station as it soared 240 
miles above the border of Russia and Kazakstan. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have capture!'' exclaimed Rominger.  
</P>
<P>
	The seven-member crew is the first to journey to the outpost  
since December, when astronauts delivered an American module and 
joined it with a Russian component already in orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been six months since anyone came to visit,'' Mission  
Control said. ``Welcome aboard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole station looks beautiful, and we're happy to be  
visiting,'' replied astronaut Daniel Barry. 
</P>
<P>
	The astronauts entered an outer chamber of the station this  
morning to collect air samples. To get things ready, ground 
controllers cranked up the heat toward room temperature. Normally, 
the station is about 25 degrees when no one is there. 
</P>
<P>
	The crew will venture all the way inside the outpost for the  
first time Sunday, when they begin their maintenance work and start 
transferring two tons of supplies into the station. 
</P>
<P>
	Before that, Barry and astronaut Tamara Jernigan were to perform  
a spacewalk starting late tonight to attach tool bags and cranes to 
the outside of the station. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the gear to be left inside are computers, tools, water and  
clothes for the station's first permanent inhabitants, who are 
supposed to move in next March. Their arrival has been delayed 
because of the Russians' inability to complete a component that 
will double as living quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the absence of the Russian component -- it should have  
gone up last year -- Saturday's docking had to be revamped. 
</P>
<P>
	Engineers devised a plan in which the station's large thrusters  
were turned off and small thrusters were used to hold the station 
steady during Discovery's slow and cautious approach Friday night. 
The moment the docking rings on the two spacecraft touched, Russian 
controllers sent a command to shut down all of the station 
thrusters. 
</P>
<P>
	Space shuttles have docked nine times with Russia's Mir station  
in recent years. But this marked the first time since Skylab in the 
mid-1970s that NASA docked with its own space station.

</P>
<P>
	With shuttle commander Kent Rominger at the controls, Discovery  
pulled up and latched on to the space station as it soared 240 
miles above the border of Russia and Kazakstan. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have capture!'' exclaimed Rominger.  
</P>
<P>
	The seven-member crew is the first to journey to the outpost  
since December, when astronauts delivered an American module and 
joined it with a Russian component already in orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been six months since anyone came to visit,'' Mission  
Control said. ``Welcome aboard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole station looks beautiful, and we're happy to be  
visiting,'' replied astronaut Daniel Barry. 
</P>
<P>
	The astronauts entered an outer chamber of the station this  
morning to collect air samples. To get things ready, ground 
controllers cranked up the heat toward room temperature. Normally, 
the station is about 25 degrees when no one is there. 
</P>
<P>
	The crew will venture all the way inside the outpost for the  
first time Sunday, when they begin their maintenance work and start 
transferring two tons of supplies into the station. 
</P>
<P>
	Before that, Barry and astronaut Tamara Jernigan were to perform  
a spacewalk starting late tonight to attach tool bags and cranes to 
the outside of the station. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the gear to be left inside are computers, tools, water and  
clothes for the station's first permanent inhabitants, who are 
supposed to move in next March. Their arrival has been delayed 
because of the Russians' inability to complete a component that 
will double as living quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the absence of the Russian component -- it should have  
gone up last year -- Saturday's docking had to be revamped. 
</P>
<P>
	Engineers devised a plan in which the station's large thrusters  
were turned off and small thrusters were used to hold the station 
steady during Discovery's slow and cautious approach Friday night. 
The moment the docking rings on the two spacecraft touched, Russian 
controllers sent a command to shut down all of the station 
thrusters. 
</P>
<P>
	Space shuttles have docked nine times with Russia's Mir station  
in recent years. But this marked the first time since Skylab in the 
mid-1970s that NASA docked with its own space station.

<HEADLINE> Forrest Sawyer Leaving ABC News </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Emmy award-winning TV news correspondent Forrest  
Sawyer, who regularly sat in for Ted Koppel on ``Nightline'' and 
Peter Jennings on ``ABC World News Tonight,'' is leaving the 
network. 
</P>
<P>
	The move follows an even higher profile ABC news departure.  
Earlier this month Hugh Downs announced he was leaving ``20/20'' 
after 21 years on the program. 
</P>
<P>
	Sawyer was unable to reach an agreement with the network on a  
new contract, the New York Post reported Saturday. The newsman was 
not reached for comment, but the network confirmed his departure, 
saying it was not part of eight to 10 cuts planned for ABC on-air 
personalities. 
</P>
<P>
	``His leaving has everything to do with the fact that Forrest  
decided that the time was right for him to move on and look 
elsewhere for other opportunities,'' said spokeswoman Eileen 
Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
	Sawyer most recently filed reports on the Kosovo refugee crisis  
in Albania and on problems with the Apache attack helicopter.

<HEADLINE> Charismatic Could Have Been Had </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Right from the start, breeder Tom Roach thought  
the chestnut colt had the look of being something special. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall of Fame trainer D. Wayne Lukas also saw promise, but he  
couldn't bring it out. 
</P>
<P>
	What owner Bob Lewis saw was a poor investment.  
</P>
<P>
	``He is a chow hound,'' Lewis said. ``He eats all the time.''  
</P>
<P>
	But in the last two months, Charismatic has paid his feed bill --  
and then some. 
</P>
<P>
	Should he win the Belmont Stakes June 5 and become the first  
Triple Crown champion in 21 years, he would earn $600,000 from the 
purse plus a $5 million bonus for sweeping the Kentucky Derby, 
Preakness and Belmont. That would push his bankroll to more than 
$6.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, however, Charismatic had eaten his way out of  
Lewis' favor. 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas ran him in a claiming race for a $62,500 pricetag at Santa  
Anita. At that time, anyone with that amount could have bought 
Charismatic, although Lukas did not want to see the horse 
purchased. 
</P>
<P>
	``We shared Wayne's feeling, but if we lost him, we'd have been  
very happy to get the $62,500. The horse was costing us money,'' 
Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Racing, after all, is a business, and even when you own a  
moneymaker like 1997 Kentucky Derby and Preakness winner Silver 
Charm, as Lewis and his wife Beverly do, you still try to cut your 
losses. The Lewises bought Charismatic for $200,000 as a weanling, 
and the ink in his ledger was redder than his chestnut coat. 
</P>
<P>
	The colt with the four white socks and the oval star and  
connected thin stripe on his face is by Summer Squall, the 1990 
Kentucky Derby runner-up and Preakness winner, out of Bali Babe. 
Secretariat and Northern Dancer are his paternal great grand sires, 
and Secretariat's sire and dam, Bold Ruler and Somethingroyal, are 
on both sides of his pedigree. 
</P>
<P>
	He was foaled in March 1996 and weaned that November at Parish  
Hill Farm of Dr. Ben Roach and his son, Tom, who bought Bali Babe 
about eight years ago at the Keeneland November sale. Summer Squall 
stands at William S. Farish's Lane's End Farm. 
</P>
<P>
	The solidly built colt -- Lukas estimated he still weighed about  
1,200 pounds at the Preakness -- takes after his parents. 
</P>
<P>
	Of Bali Babe, Tom Roach said, ``She looks like she could pull a  
beer wagon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That, however, is not why Charismatic was bought by Lewis, owner  
of the biggest beer distributorship in Southern California. He 
bought him on the recommendations of trainer-bloodstock agent Tom 
Moynihan. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was one of the best-looking weanlings I've ever seen,'' Tom  
Roach said. ``We thought he was going to be an outstanding colt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After only one win in his first nine starts, however,  
Charismatic ended up in that Feb. 11 claiming race. He finished 
second, but he got the win when the first-place finisher was 
disqualified. 
</P>
<P>
	He also did not get claimed.  
</P>
<P>
	Lewis said that when the race was over Lukas told him, ``I think  
we got away with one there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, it turned out to be the second time Lewis and Lukas  
got lucky. The colt's first win in his fifth start also was for a 
$62,500 tag Nov. 21, 1998, at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic's next start after Feb. 11 was a second in an  
allowance Feb. 19 at Santa Anita. He then finished second in the El 
Camino Real Derby March 6 at Bay Meadows and was fourth in the 1 
1-8-mile Santa Anita Derby April 3. Lukas then decided to send the 
colt to Kentucky, but it was the 1 1-2-mile Belmont Stakes he was 
pointing him for, not the 1 1-4-mile Derby or 1 3-16-mile 
Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told Bob and Beverly prior to the Kentucky Derby, `I don't  
know about the first two, but we'll look good in the Belmont -- I 
just like his style,''' Lukas said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was after the Santa Anita Derby that Lukas unlocked the key  
to success for Charismatic. 
</P>
<P>
	The key, Lewis said, is that Charismatic ``thrives on work. He  
thrives on racing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since the colt holds his weight -- horses usually lose weight  
during a campaign -- Lewis said Lukas told him he was going to have 
to work him hard before the Derby. Instead, Lukas entered 
Charismatic in the 1 1-16-mile Lexington, which he won at Keeneland 
in stakes-record time two weeks after the Santa Anita Derby and two 
weeks before the Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't push the right buttons,'' Lukas said. ``I probably in  
my career never misjudged a horse early on as I did this one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not only was Charismatic suddenly earning his keep -- his  
earnings were some $300,000 after the Lexington -- the Lewises also 
were back in the Kentucky Derby picture. 
</P>
<P>
	At the beginning of the year, they had early Derby favorite,  
Exploit, trained by Bob Baffert, who trained Silver Charm and Real 
Quiet. Then, in losing for the first time in six starts in the San 
Felipe on March 13 at Santa Anita, Exploit chipped a bone in a knee 
and was retired. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lewises then pinned their hopes on the Baffert-trained  
Straight Man, but that colt ran poorly. 
</P>
<P>
	``We weren't really looking for anyone (for the Triple Crown  
races), and Wayne came up with Charismatic,'' Bob Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Overlooking Charismatic is what handicappers and bettors did in  
the Derby. Charismatic's winning mutuel of $64.60 was the third 
largest in the 125-year history of the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the Preakness, Lukas told anybody who would listen,  
``Don't discredit the horse because I was foolish enough to run him 
in a claiming race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic, however, was allowed to go off at 8-1 in the  
Preakness, making him the longest-priced Derby winner to start that 
race since Dark Star finished fifth in 1953. 
</P>
<P>
	He might not even be the favorite in the Belmont, which could  
have as many as 14 starters. His odds should be much shorter, 
however, if for no other reason than the Roach family and friends 
betting on him. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll have about 1,000 people there,'' Tom Roach joked.  
``We've heard from people we haven't heard from in 30 or 40 
years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ex-claimer certainly will be the sentimental choice as he  
tries to become only the 12th Triple Crown winner. 
</P>
<P>
	And that would be quite a movie script: From chow hound to  
charismatic champion.

<HEADLINE> Questions About Gas Spike Persist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- As the Memorial Day weekend kicks off the  
summer driving season, supply shortages blamed for the biggest, 
fastest gasoline price spike in U.S. history are in retreat. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices are falling nationwide in a trend that is expected to  
continue for several weeks as fire-damaged refineries in California 
return to normal operation and world markets work through a glut of 
crude oil. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, for motorists and some public officials, a big question  
remains. Were drivers gouged by the oil companies when prices shot 
up so high and so fast during March and early April? 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Trade Commission and the California attorney general  
are trying to answer that question with separate investigations of 
gasoline prices in California, the nation's most populous state. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigations focus on a price spiral that sent U.S. retail  
gasoline prices up 23 cents per gallon on average between March 5 
and April 9. In California, the increase was even sharper: a 
45-cent climb to $1.60, according to the Lundberg Letter, a 
newsletter that analyzes oil and gasoline markets. The full-service 
price for premium rose to nearly $2 in some parts of Northern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationally, the jump was faster and steeper than any other,  
including price increases that followed Iraq's invasion of Kuwait 
in 1990 and the Arab oil embargo in 1974, said Trilby Lundberg, 
publisher of the Lundberg Survey, a bimonthly review of gasoline 
prices. But it followed more than a year of historically low prices 
resulting from weak demand and an oversupply of crude. 
</P>
<P>
	``The industry has not insisted on making a handsome profit at  
the retail level,'' said Lundberg. ``They are crazed price 
cutters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What bothers investigators is that as retail prices rose,  
California refineries gross revenues -- which include operating 
costs that can fluctuate widely -- rose on average from 27 cents per 
gallon of gasoline to 70 cents per gallon, according to California 
Energy Commission figures. 
</P>
<P>
	``So far there hasn't been an adequate explanation from the oil  
industry as to the causes of the price spike,'' said California 
Attorney General Bill Lockyer. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for the FTC said she could not comment on the  
direction of the probe or any preliminary findings. 
</P>
<P>
	In his investigation, Lockyer is not looking for criminal  
wrongdoing, but indications that the oil companies engaged in 
unfair business practices by boosting prices higher than their 
costs justified. If there is evidence of that, his office would 
consider filing a lawsuit seeking to force the companies to forfeit 
profits considered excessive. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar probes that have followed big price runups have failed  
to produce evidence of collusion or unfair pricing. Oil company 
officials contend that it is the market, not companies, that 
determines the price consumers pay at the pump. 
</P>
<P>
	``The marketplace is going to move up and move down. When you  
balance it all out it's still a tough business: low margins, very 
competitive,'' said Fred Gorrell, a spokesman for San 
Francisco-based Chevron Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	``What refiners do is look at supply and demand and competition  
and we take the marketplace as we find it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	What oil companies found during March and April was a  
marketplace shaken by a remarkable chain of unrelated events. 
</P>
<P>
	In a matter of weeks:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Fires and transmission glitches caused four California  
refineries to curtail gasoline operation from Feb. 23 to March 23, 
leading to a 10 percent drop in overall production. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Five days later U.S. warplanes damaged a key Iraqi pumping  
station, raising fears of a drop in crude oil supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	--Two weeks after that, in an unusual display of resolve, OPEC  
members voted to cut production by 2.1 billion barrels per day. 
</P>
<P>
	``The price is still a bargain. We are not being badly  
treated,'' said Phil Berman, author of the Pump Price Report 
newsletter. ``Gasoline was underpriced before. Now prices are 
beginning to fall again. There's no sinister conspiracy here.''

<HEADLINE> Hoffa Leads Talks As Walkout Looms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) -- Talks to avert a Teamsters strike against  
companies that haul new cars to dealers ended Saturday with little 
progress. Union President James P. Hoffa warned drivers are ready 
to walk when their contract expires at 12:01 a.m. EDT Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we have to call a strike, we will,'' Hoffa said before 4 1/2  
hours of closed-door bargaining failed to resolve the key issues. 
``Unless we can talk some sense into the heads of management, 
that's the only recourse a union has.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The talks were to resume Sunday, again at a Virginia hotel near  
the union's Washington headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	The chief management negotiator agreed that many matters were  
unresolved. But Ian Hunter of the National Automobile Transporters 
Association added, ``There's no need to be concerned yet. This is 
typical collective bargaining, rhetoric aside.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The negotiations are an early test of Hoffa's leadership of the  
union once led by his late father, Jimmy Hoffa, before the elder 
Hoffa was sent to prison in 1967 for jury-tampering and fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	James P. Hoffa, a labor lawyer, took over in March, winning an  
election held after a campaign finance scandal had ousted the 
incumbent. Hoffa joined the car-hauling talks for the first time 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Teamsters contract covering about 12,000 drivers, mechanics,  
yard and office workers nationwide expires at 12:01 a.m. EDT 
Tuesday. Union members earlier this month authorized their 
negotiating team to call a strike if talks failed. 
</P>
<P>
	In this robust economy, a Teamster strike of more than a few  
days could put a dent in auto sales on pace for record this year. 
The big-rig drivers move 95 percent of new cars to the nation's 
showrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	The union could target one or all of the 17 major trucking  
companies that contract with automakers to move new cars to dealers 
from assembly plants, ports and rail yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Automakers have said they would use their own drivers and hire  
independents to help get some vehicles to dealers in the event of a 
strike. 
</P>
<P>
	The sticking point appears to be an industry proposal for a  
wage-scale giving entry-level drivers lower salaries. 
</P>
<P>
	``We could never tolerate a two-tier pay scale. That's a  
strikeable issue,'' Hoffa said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not afraid of a strike because our people have been  
working hard and I know that the industry is making record profits. 
There's never been a better time for us to get our piece of the 
pie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Teamsters also want better pensions and health care, higher wage  
increases than management is offering and fewer hours on the job. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffa has promised members major pension breakthroughs in this  
contract, said Ken Paff of Teamsters for a Democratic Union, the 
group that supported Hoffa's opponent in the last election. 
</P>
<P>
	``In that sense, it's being watched nationally,'' Paff said.  
</P>
<P>
	Hoffa would not discuss details of any strike plan.  
</P>
<P>
	Car haulers say Teamsters are the highest-paid truckers at  
$68,000 on average. On Friday, the companies released a study 
concluding that labor costs are rising faster than what the hauling 
companies can charge automakers. Labor costs have gone up 33 
percent in the past four years, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Cathay Cancels Two Dozen Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Cathay Pacific Airways canceled two dozen  
flights today after growing numbers of pilots facing pay cuts and 
layoff threats called in sick to work, the airline said. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-four flights were canceled today and the airline may  
cancel more later in the day, said Katherine Wang, Cathay's 
corporate communication manager. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hong Kong carrier also has stopped taking bookings since  
late Friday for flights flying in the next two weeks ``to ensure 
the situation is under control,'' Wang said. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who have already booked their flights are not affected,  
she said. Cathay has an average of 116 flights daily. 
</P>
<P>
	The carrier and its pilots have been locked in a dispute after  
it asked its senior pilots in March to take an 8 percent pay cut in 
exchange for stock options after Cathay suffered its first loss in 
35 years last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Cathay lost $69 million last year.  
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Cathay halted nine weeks of talks with the pilots'  
union, the Hong Kong Aircrew Association, and offered a revised pay 
package, which included a smaller pay cut and better stock options. 
</P>
<P>
	The carrier is giving the pilots until noon on June 11 to decide  
whether to take a pay cut, retire early, or be fired. 
</P>
<P>
	Some pilots, claiming they were too stressed because of the  
layoff threats, have been taking sick days. Hong Kong law allows 
pilots to stop flying because of stress. 
</P>
<P>
	Union officials denied they had organized the action to force  
Cathay to reopen negotiations, but said they would not rule out 
future strike actions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are only urging them to go and see a doctor,'' said John  
Findlay, the union's secretary-general. ``If a pilot thinks he or 
she is unfit for duty, he or she is obliged'' to stop flying. 
</P>
<P>
	Cathay officials refused to disclose any numbers, but Findlay  
said Friday that 40 to 50 pilots were absent from work that day, 
forcing Cathay to cancel four flights. He did not know how many 
pilots were out sick today. 
</P>
<P>
	Wang said passengers would be diverted to other flights with  
Cathay or other airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the impact on air traffic to the United States appeared  
minimal, with only a single flight canceled.

<HEADLINE> Sportswriter Going To Big Leagues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Jerome Holtzman, known as ``the dean'' of Chicago  
sportswriters, is going to the big leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	After a 56-year career with Chicago newspapers that includes his  
current employer, the Chicago Tribune, Holtzman will become an 
official historian for major league baseball commissioner Allan 
``Bud'' Selig. 
</P>
<P>
	The position is tailor-made for Holtzman, whose storied career  
has been honored by induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 
1990. He also received the Associated Press Sports Editor's Red 
Smith Award in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The accomplishment that has endeared the veteran writer to  
scores of relief pitchers occurred in 1960, when Holtzman created 
the idea of using a save to recognize a reliever's ability to 
protect a lead. Six years later, the save became an official 
statistic. 
</P>
<P>
	Holtzman broke into journalism as a newsroom copy boy on June  
23, 1943, at age 17 on the same day he graduated from high school. 
His byline has appeared on a virtually daily basis since 1946. 
</P>
<P>
	Holtzman, who spent more than 40 years on the baseball beat, is  
the author of the book ``No Cheering in the Press Box,'' a history 
of the craft of sports writing. He also wrote ``The 
Commissioners,'' a history of the nine men who have held baseball's 
highest office, and he edited ``Fielder's Choice,'' an anthology of 
baseball fiction. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's Tribune carries Holtzman's farewell column, in which he  
writes about his favorite baseball players. He lists Ted Williams 
as the best hitter and Sandy Koufax, Bob Gibson and Greg Maddux as 
the best pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
	Holtzman considers Willie Mays to be the greatest all-around  
player. He also calls the 1969 Chicago Cubs late-season swoon 
baseball's biggest flop.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- This Memorial Day weekend, visions of barbecues  
and beach chairs must surely be dancing in the heads of Wall Street 
traders. 
</P>
<P>
	For one thing, they could use a break. Before a solid gain  
Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average pitched violently all week 
amid fears of higher interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	For another, this weekend is the unofficial start of summer, and  
that could mean the start of the highly unofficial summer market 
rally. 
</P>
<P>
	Market gurus are divided on whether stocks truly do gain during  
the lazy, hazy days of summer. But on the worst days of this past 
week, pundit after pundit looked hopefully ahead to ``the summer 
rally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The market has its moods,'' said Robert Robbins, senior vice  
president and market strategist at Robinson-Humphrey Co. Inc. of 
Atlanta. ``Friday is better than Monday, and summer is better than 
winter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Major market indexes nearly always improve after May, a  
notoriously weak month for stocks. The Dow fell 2.1 percent this 
May, its steepest monthly decline of the year. It's a fallow time 
for corporate earnings; investors planning summer vacations cash in 
some gains, and market professionals quietly begin their string of 
three-day weekends. 
</P>
<P>
	For years, the Stock Trader's Almanac by veteran market watcher  
Yale Hirsch has attempted to gauge the supposed summer rally by 
charting the difference between the lowest Dow close in May or June 
and the highest close of the summer, whether that peak occurs in 
July, August or September. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been some bonanzas: a 22.9 percent jump in 1987; a  
gain of 18.4 percent in 1997, as the Dow raced past 8,000 for the 
first time. Both of those summer rallies, however, were obliterated 
by massive losses in the following October. 
</P>
<P>
	But in the average year, stocks rally the most in winter. And  
while investors may choose to remember the gains, the past few 
summers have brought crushing losses as well. 
</P>
<P>
	In July 1997, the devaluation of Thailand's baht shattered the  
Asian currency market and rippled into the U.S. economy. And last 
summer, Russia's financial and political upheaval contributed to 
the Dow's stunning 512.62-point drop on August 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, analysts say investors tend to be a little more  
sanguine in summer, less likely to shed stocks because of one bad 
corporate earnings report or troubles in a faraway land. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Babson, president and chairman of investment advisory  
firm Babson-United Inc., said that may change as investors grow 
ever more attached to the technology that allows them to check on 
portfolios, read financial news, and trade stocks online. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're away at the beach or at your cabin in the woods, you  
can stay right up on things,'' he said. ``That might mean an end to 
the quiet summers on Wall Street.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And while foreign markets are more settled this year, analysts  
see plenty of clouds forming over the U.S. economy. Jan Holman, 
vice president of investment services at American Express Financial 
Advisors, believes in the summer rally but ticks off a number of 
trouble spots that could threaten stocks this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Large-cap growth stock valuations are at historic highs; small  
stocks have been trading near bear-market levels for some time; we 
are seeing signs that inflation has picked up; the Fed is 
threatening to raise rates and to top it off, many Internet and 
technology favorites are off 40 to 50 percent,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	It doesn't sound much like a day at the beach. But many  
investment professionals are sticking to their mantra: Ordinary 
Americans should invest for the duration, and ignore short-term 
swings. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not necessary for most people to be on top of every  
market swing, every day,'' Babson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Take time to enjoy the summer weather,'' echoed Holman.  
</P>
<P>
	And Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany  
Corp., said investors should keep their eyes on the fundamental 
factors that move markets all year long: corporate earnings and 
major economic trends like inflation and interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those things serve as a much better gauge of what the market  
is doing,'' Johnson said. ``People shouldn't try to explain it away 
with seasonal things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Friday's trading, the Dow rose 92.81 to 10,559.74, finishing  
269.54 lower for the week. Even with a loss for the week and the 
past month, the Dow still is up 15.0 percent for the year so far. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 composite rose 20.43 to 1,301.84, but  
finished down 28.45 for the week. The index is now 5.9 percent 
higher than when it began the year. The Nasdaq composite gained 
51.37 to 2,470.52 Friday, losing 49.62 for the week. It is 12.7 
percent higher in the year to date. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index rose 8.24 to 622.26 Friday, losing  
14.61 for the week. It is now up 4.4 percent for the year. The 
American Stock Exchange index rose 4.35 to 778.74 Friday, and is 
down 16.63 for the week. It is up 13 percent for the year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 5.76 to 438.68  
Friday, down 10.46 for the week. It has now gained 4.0 percent this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wilshire Associates Equity Index, which represents the  
combined market value of all NYSE, American and Nasdaq issues, 
ended the week at $11.977 trillion, off $276.68 billion from last 
week. A year ago the index was $10.362 trillion.

	NATO Hits Kosovo Hard  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO jets struck hard today at Serb  
forces in the Kosovo province. NATO said its aircraft ``enjoyed 
considerable success'' on day 66 of its air campaign, aimed at 
forcing Yugoslavia to withdraw troops from Kosovo and allowing 
840,000 ethnic Albanian refugees to return under the protection of 
an international peacekeeping force. NATO said in a statement this 
morning at its headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, that alliance 
planes had flown 639 sorties, including 218 strike sorties, in the 
previous 24 hours. It said targets hit included at least 17 
artillery pieces and two tanks in Kosovo.

	Indian Attacks in Kashmir Continue  
</P>
<P>
	DRAS, India (AP) -- Indian jets unleashed more attacks on Islamic  
guerrilla targets today in the disputed region of Kashmir, despite 
an offer from Pakistan to hold talks to diffuse tensions over the 
Himalayan territory claimed by both nuclear powers. India demanded 
the Pakistani government rein in its military, which New Delhi 
accuses of backing the guerrillas' incursion into the Indian-held 
part of Kashmir and their capture of mountain outposts. The Indian 
air force has been conducting strikes since Wednesday against 
positions held by the guerrillas, who India says include Pakistani 
soldiers disguised as militants.

	Shuttle Links With Space Station  
</P>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Discovery docked with the new  
international space station early today for six days of activities 
that include a spacewalk, repair work and supply transfers. The 
link marks another milestone for the new outpost, which was last 
visited by astronauts in December. With shuttle commander Kent 
Rominger at the controls, Discovery pulled up and latched on to the 
space station as it soared 240 miles above the border of Russia and 
Kazakstan. The crew will venture all the way inside the outpost for 
the first time Sunday, when they begin their maintenance work and 
start transferring two tons of supplies into the station.

	Seniors Put Shooting Behind Them  
</P>
<P>
	CONYERS, Ga. (AP) -- A week after a classmate shot and wounded  
six students their school, seniors at Heritage High School 
graduated yesterday. Although none of the graduates were among the 
wounded, the violence that ripped apart their lives seemed to bring 
them together, a school counselor said. Extra officers patrolled 
the ceremony and parents and teachers tried to focus on 
achievements rather than a rehash of the shooting. ``Forget about 
the past, we are the future,'' Class President Martin Humphrey said 
as the ceremony came to a close.

	L.A. Doctors Vote To Unionize  
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Hundreds of Los Angeles County doctors voted  
to unionize yesterday. They became part of a growing number of 
physicians across the nation who are unionizing, a trend stemming 
from the growing influence of health maintenance organizations and 
the belief that administrators have assumed too much influence over 
patient care, the doctors said. The 790 county doctors, many of 
whom care for the poor and uninsured, joined the Union of American 
Physicians and Dentists on a 341 to 182 vote, or 65 percent to 35 
percent.

layoff threats. The Hong Kong carrier also has stopped taking 
bookings since late yesterday for flights flying in the next two 
weeks ``to ensure the situation is under control,'' an airline 
spokeswoman said. Passengers who have already booked their flights 
are not affected, she said. Cathay has an average of 116 flights 
daily. Cathay lost $69 million last year, the first loss in 35 
years.

pre-med student, on her favorite CBS daytime drama, ``The Young and 
the Restless.'' The teen-ager won the gold in at the 1998 Winter 
Olympics and decided to turn pro instead of skating for a second 
gold medal in the 2002 Winter Olympics. But Lipinski, who turns 17 
in June, is not kissing the ice goodbye. She still practices 10 
hours a week to stay in shape for ``Stars on Ice,'' a 62-city

	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Tom Candiotti earned his 150th career  
victory in his sixth try, pitching the Oakland Athletics past the 
Baltimore Orioles 2-1 last night. The win was Oakland's ninth 
straight at home, its longest such streak since another nine-game 
run in 1992. The A's have won four in a row overall since returning 
from an 0-6 road trip. Candiotti gave up four hits in 6 1-3 
innings. He struck out three, walked none and generally confounded 
Baltimore batters.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Fret Over Farming Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As the House bickers over a $61 billion  
agriculture spending bill, some lawmakers and industry analysts 
wonder how America's struggling farmers will react to the push to 
trim government programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Marcy Kaptur, the top Democrat on the House Appropriations  
subcommittee that sets farm spending levels, warned during floor 
debate last week that the fighting ``results in a negative message 
for agriculture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``One after another after another, it's like drip, drip, drip  
... every single sector is hemorrhaging and here we are nitpicking 
a bill that has come within budget,'' said Kaptur, D-Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	Added Rep. Terry Everett, R-Ala.: ``At a time when farmers are  
choosing whether they will sell their family farms ... it is 
incomprehensible. I'm just appalled at what's going on in this 
House.'' 
</P>
<P>
	From Rep. Tom Latham, R-Iowa, came the plea, ``We have lived  
within our budget constraints. Please don't do this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Conservatives led by Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., have made  
repeated attempts to cut the bill. They say they do not intend to 
hurt farmers but fear GOP leaders are bent on ignoring the budget's 
spending rules. 
</P>
<P>
	So far only one of the proposed cuts has passed -- $500,000 from  
the Agriculture Department's chief information officer's budget. 
But Coburn has said he has 115 amendments proposing millions in 
cuts, mostly from agricultural research programs. Farmers and their 
supporters contend the research is needed to improve crop yields 
and productivity. 
</P>
<P>
	The arguing on Capitol Hill comes amid farmers' continued  
struggle to deal with low commodity prices and lagging overseas 
demand for their products. Reducing government programs now would 
worsen the situation, some lawmakers say. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers did not appear to have immediate and strong reaction to  
the decision by GOP leaders to put the agriculture spending bill on 
hold after two days of debate last week. But that quietness may not 
last. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is so much posturing going on in the Congress that there  
is a tendency for people in this area. . . to discount such 
shenanigans,'' said Neil Harl, a professor at Iowa State 
University. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was some raising of eyebrows but most did not consider  
it a serious threat to programs in the agricultural budget.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Harl cautioned, ``Times are tough enough in most farm  
areas that any threat to appropriations is taken seriously.'' The 
spending bill's outcome could influence voting next year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``History shows that when farmers are in deep economic and  
financial difficulty, they tend to vote less conservatively than 
when times are good so there is always that possibility,'' Harl 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Leland Swenson, president of the National Farmers Union, urged  
that the House ``wake up and begin to act in a constructive way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The economic pressures, the weather pressures and then to have  
on top of it these utterly ridiculous mannerisms in Washington 
really does send a negative message to the countryside,'' Swenson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Only a year ago, Congress passed a $6 billion bailout package to  
compensate for declining commodities and livestock prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaptur, in a telephone interview Friday, said farmers may blame  
Congress for acting slowly during these tough times. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, acting on a request from March, Congress this month  
finally approved an emergency spending bill that included $153 
million to replenish farm loans. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers this week will begin receiving $2 billion in disaster  
payments that were approved in the October bailout. Agriculture 
Secretary Dan Glickman said the payments were delayed because the 
package was difficult to administer. 
</P>
<P>
	For farmers who had started spring planting by the time the  
latest aid comes through, the current debate in Congress might make 
them wonder if ``Congress is fiddling while Rome burns,'' Kaptur 
said.

<P>
	COLLEGE PARK, Md. (AP) -- Eighth-seeded Syracuse advanced to the  
NCAA Division I Lacrosse championship game for the 10th time 
Saturday, scoring six straight goals at the outset of the second 
half en route to a 13-9 upset of Georgetown. 
</P>
<P>
	Syracuse (12-4) held fifth-seeded Georgetown (13-3) scoreless  
for a span of 27 minutes, 17 seconds and outscored the Hoyas 6-0 in 
the pivotal third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orangemen will seek their seventh title Monday against the  
winner of Saturday's second semifinal game, between Johns Hopkins 
and Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	Syracuse, the first eighth-seeded team to reach the Final Four,  
avenged losses to Princeton, Loyola (Maryland) and Georgetown in 
the first three rounds of the tournament. Princeton was the 
three-time defending champion and Loyola's unbeaten season included 
a 10-8 win over Syracuse in April. 
</P>
<P>
	It was more of the same against Georgetown, which beat Syracuse  
17-13 just three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orangemen trailed 4-1 late in the first quarter before  
rallying to a 5-5 tie at halftime. Chris Cordisc then scored twice 
as Syracuse reeled off four successive goals in a span of 3 
minutes, 18 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Byrnes added his second goal of the game and Marc Alexander  
scored at 10:56 to make it 11-5. 
</P>
<P>
	It was 12-5 before Mike Kanach scored for Georgetown with 10:40  
left, the Hoyas' first goal since Andy Flick found the back of the 
net with 7:57 remaining in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgetown's Scott Urick recorded his third goal of the game to  
make it 12-7, but Matt Cutia responded with his third goal of the 
afternoon to clinch the victory. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the 17th successive appearance in the Final Four by  
Syracuse and the first with John Desko as head coach. Desko served 
as an assistant under Roy Simmons, Jr. since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the two schools have an intense rivalry on the  
basketball court as members of the Big East, this was only their 
sixth meeting in lacrosse. Syracuse leads the series 4-2.

<HEADLINE> Documents Led to China Spy Flap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- On a day in 1995, a Chinese defector walked  
into a U.S. embassy and had something too good to believe -- boxes 
of secret Chinese documents for the CIA. 
</P>
<P>
	Buried among the stacks of papers were 20 pages that would  
reverberate at the highest levels of America's intelligence 
agencies and lead eventually to the Chinese espionage brouhaha that 
has enveloped Washington in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The document, which included several handmade drawings, provided  
U.S. nuclear weapons experts their first solid evidence that China 
had obtained design information about America's newest and most 
sophisticated nuclear warhead. 
</P>
<P>
	And what makes the case even more bizarre was the discovery  
later that the individual actually was a double agent for China's 
top intelligence agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week's release of a congressional report declaring that  
China has classified information on the full range of America's 
nuclear arsenal heavily relied on information gleaned from the 20 
pages provided by the defector-double agent. 
</P>
<P>
	Many perplexing questions remain.  
</P>
<P>
	If he was working for Chinese intelligence all along, why would  
China let the United States know it had been able to steal such 
sensitive secrets? 
</P>
<P>
	Could it have been a botched attempt at espionage cat and mouse,  
or a diabolically clever maneuver to mislead? 
</P>
<P>
	And if deception and disinformation were the motives, how  
accurately does the document reflect what China actually knows? 
</P>
<P>
	If U.S. intelligence officials have the answers, they're not  
telling. Much about the phony defector -- known in intelligence 
parlance as ``directed walk-in'' -- is still secret. Not even the 
embassy's location or the day of the defector's visit has been made 
public -- only that the person has returned to China. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes no sense at all,'' says Hayden Peake, a retired CIA  
officer who teaches a course on intelligence activities. One motive 
might have been that China offered the document to give their agent 
credibility. ``He has to do something to earn his credentials,'' 
Peake said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., chairman of special committee  
that issued the China espionage report, had some ideas of his own, 
although the declassified version of the report doesn't attempt to 
speculate. 
</P>
<P>
	The walk-in agent was ``under the control'' of China's  
intelligence agency, said Cox, who suggested three theories: 
</P>
<P>
	--China may have released the dated document to mask the true  
source of the information or when it was obtained. It was dated 
1988, but that date might be misleading. 
</P>
<P>
	--The sensitive pages might have been included by mistake among  
thousands of pages provided by the double agent. 
</P>
<P>
	--China may have wanted to advertise it had design information  
about America's most sophisticated warhead as intimidation against 
Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever the reason, the 781-page Cox report relies heavily on  
information in the document to conclude that China obtained design 
information about the W-88 warhead, which was developed at the Los 
Alamos weapons laboratory and sits atop Trident submarine-launched 
missiles. 
</P>
<P>
	No one disputes that the document revealed that some secret  
information about the W-88, the most sophisticated warhead in the 
U.S. nuclear arsenal, had been obtained by China. But the Clinton 
administration has argued privately that the information falls well 
short of suggesting China has any detailed knowledge of the 
warhead's design, much less that it was able to replicate it. 
</P>
<P>
	A CIA damage assessment, reviewed by a special panel of experts,  
concluded that China obtained ``at least basic design information'' 
on the W-88 and that the information ``probably accelerated its 
program to develop future nuclear weapons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The walk-in document included handmade drawings of several  
re-entry nose-cones, information such as weights and explosive 
yields of six warheads, including the W-88, and some general 
configuration of some internal W-88 components. Much of the 
information in the documents can be found from public sources, said 
a government official familiar with the document.

talks, said Friday that negotiations were intense. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is fair to say there are a number of major issues  
unresolved,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A strike could throw a roadblock in front of the auto industry's  
record sales pace. So far this year, U.S. sales of new cars and 
light trucks are up 9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Teamsters contract covers about 12,000 drivers, mechanics,  
yard and office workers nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	If a strike were called, industry officials expect the Teamsters  
initially would target just one of the major trucking companies 
that contract with automakers to move new cars to dealers from 
assembly plants, ports and rail yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Teamsters spokesman Chip Roth said Friday that the union could  
choose to strike some or all of the 17 trucking companies that are 
at the negotiating table. 
</P>
<P>
	The Teamsters are seeking higher wages, improved pensions and  
health care, and a reduction in ``excessive work hours.'' They also 
are resisting proposals to pay lower salaries to entry-level 
drivers. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Hunter said, automakers are pressing for lower prices  
from car haulers; labor costs have gone up 33 percent in the past 
four years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our drivers are the highest paid in the trucking industry,''  
Hunter said. ``The average driver wage last year was $68,000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Automakers likely would use their own drivers and hire  
independents to help get some vehicles to dealers in the event of a 
strike. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're monitoring the situation closely,'' said Ford Motor Co.  
spokesman Ron Iori. ``We're hoping both the Teamsters and the 
haulers can reach a mutually agreeable situation.''

<HEADLINE> Liv Tyler Stays Close To Both Dads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Liv Tyler always knew she had a rock star for a  
father. It wasn't until she grew up that she realized she had two 
rock star fathers. 
</P>
<P>
	The actress grew up thinking of rocker Todd Rundgren as Dad, and  
didn't get a glimpse of biological father and Aerosmith lead singer 
Steven Tyler until her mother pointed him out at a Rundgren 
concert. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was like, `Is that Mick Jagger's son?''' Tyler says in the  
debut issue of Nylon magazine. ``And she laughed so hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A year or so later, Tyler learned the full truth. But instead of  
resisting, she embraced the idea of being close to her stepfather 
and the man whose name she carried. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, Todd is my dad as much as Steven is,'' she said, ``It  
just means a lot to me that I still have this beautiful 
relationship with Todd.''

<HEADLINE> Man Accused of Selling 1,000 Guns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- A man sold as many as 1,000 semiautomatic  
pistols that were linked to robberies, homicides and other violent 
crimes, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal grand jury on Friday indicted Sean Twomey, 31, of  
Hayward. He allegedly used a falsified federal firearms license to 
obtain the guns from legitimate wholesalers and then distributed 
them with the help of convicted felons. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other men and a woman also were indicted.  
</P>
<P>
	Twomey allegedly obliterated the weapons' serial numbers to  
prevent their being traced back to him and sold them at a 
significant mark-up in the San Francisco Bay area, said Tracy Hite 
of the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. 
</P>
<P>
	The weapons, ranging from cheap Lorcin models to expensive  
Glocks, were used by criminals in at least three states, Hite said. 
About 40 pistols linked to criminal suspects have been recovered so 
far. 
</P>
<P>
	The ATF called the case ``the largest ongoing gun trafficking  
case in the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Twomey, jailed in Oakland, denied the allegations,  
court-appointed attorney Daniel Horowitz said. 
</P>
<P>
	Horowitz said federal authorities were exaggerating to  
capitalize on national outrage over the shooting rampage last month 
at a Colorado high school. 
</P>
<P>
	Twomey's arraignment is set for June 7.  
</P>
<P>
	The maximum penalty for each conviction for using a false  
firearms license, or for being a felon in possession of a firearm, 
is 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.

<HEADLINE> Sir Bear Springs Upset in Met Mile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Last fall, Sir Bear gave 62-year-old trainer  
Ralph Ziadie his first Grade I victory when he upset Coronado's 
Quest to win the Cigar Mile at Aqueduct. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday, the 6-year-old gelding returned to New York and,  
overlooked at 6-1, gave Ziadie his second Grade I victory, charging 
from off the pace to take the $500,000 Metropolitan Handicap at 
Belmont Park by 1 3/4 lengths over longshot Crafty Friend. 
</P>
<P>
	Liberty Gold, another longshot with odds of 10-1, was third,  
followed by favored Affirmed Success, Lord Grillo, the 3-year-old 
Cat Thief, Lil's Lad and Rock and Roll. 
</P>
<P>
	``This horse never gets any respect,'' said an emotional Ziadie,  
who is based at Calder racetrack in Florida. ``Any Grade I race 
means a lot to any trainer, whether it's Wayne Lukas or me. I was a 
little nervous before the race, because we had a new jockey, but 
Johnny (Velazquez) rode him perfect, as if he'd ridden him every 
time before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under Velazquez, who got the mount after Jerry Bailey elected to  
ride the Lukas-trained Cat Thief and Richard Migliore had already 
committed to Crafty Friend, Sir Bear broke well and then settled in 
sixth position on the outside as Lil's Lad, Cat Thief and Affirmed 
Success sped through early fractions of :22.44 and :44.64. 
</P>
<P>
	Coming out of the far turn, Affirmed Success grabbed the lead  
but was unable to hold it for long as Crafty Friend rallied to take 
over approaching the eighth pole. But Sir Bear, who had moved into 
striking position between horses on the turn, was moving fastest of 
all on the outside and drew clear of the field in the final yards 
to hit the wire in 1:34.55 for the mile. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything worked out perfectly,'' said Velazquez. ``He broke  
well and I took him back off the pace. He took some dirt in his 
face, but he was relaxed the whole time. They were moving (fast) up 
front, and he picked it up on the turn and began passing horses. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sounds pretty easy, right? But I was expecting a fast pace  
and it worked out good for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sir Bear, who extended his lifetime record to 15 victories in 44  
starts, earned $300,000 for the win and boosted his bankroll to 
$1,362,160 for owner Barbara Smollin. He returned $14.60, $7.90 and 
$6. 
</P>
<P>
	Crafty Friend paid $22 and $12, while Liberty Gold, ridden by  
Jose Santos, paid $5.40 for show. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very disappointed,'' said Richard Schosberg, trainer of  
the beaten favorite. ``(Jockey Mike Smith) should have waited 
longer, but he got a little anxious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ziadie said he was considering keeping Sir Bear in New York for  
the Brooklyn Handicap (June 12), a race he finished third in last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``He loves New York, I don't know if it's the weather or what,''  
said Ziadie. ``But he's also like vintage wine -- the older he gets, 
the better he gets.''

<HEADLINE> Girl Has Radical Surgery for Face </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Doctors using a 3-D model of a 5-year-old  
girl's skull spent 11 hours in the operating room repositioning her 
lopsided face, using bone grafts, metal plates and screws. 
</P>
<P>
	A replica of Paige Raczynski's skull allowed surgeons at St.  
Christopher's Hospital for Children to plan precisely how and where 
to make incisions, how much bone grafting would be needed and in 
what shapes. 
</P>
<P>
	Paige was born with craniofacial microsomia, a genetic condition  
that caused the bones on the left side of her face to be 
underdeveloped or undeveloped. She is missing some of her cheekbone 
and her jaw bones and muscles grew abnormally, giving the left side 
of her face a sunken appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	The disorder occurs in about one of every 5,600 births.  
</P>
<P>
	Paige has trouble eating, speaking and hearing. She was  
diagnosed with the condition immediately after birth and has 
undergone 24 surgeries since she was 5 months old. The major effort 
Friday, completed without complications, could mean no more 
surgeries until her teen-age years. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason we're doing this is to improve her eating ability  
and speech,'' said Dr. Adrian Lo. ``But we are also improving her 
appearance to get her looking as normal a child as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The kindergartener's surgical incision was made behind her  
hairline, so she will have minimal scarring. Doctors hope she will 
recover soon enough to attend her kindergarten graduation on June 
9. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's a trooper,'' said her father, David Raczynski.

<HEADLINE> Old Trieste Wins The Californian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Today was a good day for offspring of  
A.P. Indy at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Old Trieste, a 4-year-old son of A.P. Indy who was running in a  
race for the first time in almost nine months, led all the way in 
winning The Californian by seven lengths over Budroyale. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day, A.P. Assay, a 5-year-old daughter of A.P.  
Indy who hadn't raced for nearly seven months, took the lead at the 
top of the stretch in winning the Desert Stormer Handicap by two 
lengths over Woodman's Dancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridden by Chris McCarron and carrying 116 pounds, Old Trieste  
made it look easy in the $300,000 Grade II Californian, turning on 
the jets entering the final turn and pulling away for his decisive 
triumph. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very, very nice colt,'' McCarron said. ``It was a  
very impressive turn-of-foot he gave me after he ran as fast as he 
did down the backside. He gave me some goose bumps.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Old Trieste hadn't run in a race since winning the Del Mar  
Breeders' Cup Handicap by five lengths last Sept. 6. The 
Kentucky-bred colt was sidelined due to a deep abscess in his left 
front foot. 
</P>
<P>
	Old Trieste bruised the same foot May 18, but trainer Mike Puype  
said it wasn't anything serious, and he was obviously correct. 
</P>
<P>
	``He ran out of his brains, what else can you say? I mean, it  
was awesome,'' Puype said. ``He is just a lot of horse, and if you 
knew even half the problems that he's been through -- he's just 
amazing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since finishing 10th in last year's Kentucky Derby almost 13  
months ago, Old Trieste has won all four of his races by a combined 
28 1/2 lengths. McCarron has been aboard all four times. 
</P>
<P>
	Old Trieste covered 1 1/8 miles in a swift 1:46 2-5 and, as the  
second-favorite in a field of seven, paid $6.80, $4.40 and $2.60. 
</P>
<P>
	The stakes record of 1:45 4-5 was set by Spectacular Bid in  
1980. Mud Route won the race last year in 1:48. 
</P>
<P>
	The win was the sixth in 11 lifetime starts for Old Trieste and  
was worth $180,000, raising his career earnings to $762,732. 
</P>
<P>
	Budroyale, ridden by Garrett Gomez and carrying 120 pounds,  
crossed the finish line 5 1/2 lengths in front of Puerto Madero and 
returned $4.40 and $2.40. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was phenomenal. I mean, my horse ran a phenomenal race,''  
Gomez said. ``He ran his eyeballs out. His legs just couldn't go as 
fast as that other horse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Puerto Madero, the 11-10 favorite ridden by Kent Desormeaux and  
carrying high weight of 122 pounds, was two lengths ahead of 
Moore's Flat at the wire and paid $2.20 to show. 
</P>
<P>
	Following Moore's Flat across the finish line in the 46th  
running of the race for 3-year-olds and up were Hal's Pal, Clover 
Hunter and Self Feeder. 
</P>
<P>
	Next for Old Trieste figures to be the $1 million Hollywood Gold  
Cup on June 27. Skip Away won the race last year, with Puerto 
Madero finishing second. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridden by Eddie Delahoussaye and carrying 122 pounds, A.P. Assay  
covered six furlongs in 1:08 3-5 and, as the 3-5 favorite in the 
$106,000 race for fillies and mares, paid $3.20, $2.60 and $2.10. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory was A.P. Assay's fifth in nine lifetime starts and  
was worth $63,600, raising the career earnings of the Kentucky-bred 
mare to $359,550. 
</P>
<P>
	A.P. Assay was running in her first race since finishing fifth  
in the Breeders' Cup Sprint last Nov. 7. 
</P>
<P>
	Woodman's Dancer returned $4.40 and $2.10, and Corona Lake, who  
won the race last year, finished third this time and paid $2.10 to 
show.

<HEADLINE> Syracuse Reaches Lacrosse Finals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLLEGE PARK, Md. (AP) -- Eighth-seeded Syracuse advanced to the  
NCAA Division I Lacrosse championship game for the 10th time 
Saturday, scoring six straight goals at the outset of the second 
half en route to a 13-9 upset of Georgetown. 
</P>
<P>
	Syracuse (12-4) held fifth-seeded Georgetown (13-3) scoreless  
for a span of 27 minutes, 17 seconds and outscored the Hoyas 6-0 in 
the pivotal third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orangemen will seek their seventh title Monday against the  
winner of Saturday's second semifinal game, between Johns Hopkins 
and Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	Syracuse, the first eighth-seeded team to reach the Final Four,  
avenged losses to Princeton, Loyola (Maryland) and Georgetown in 
the first three rounds of the tournament. Princeton was the 
three-time defending champion and Loyola's unbeaten season included 
a 10-8 win over Syracuse in April. 
</P>
<P>
	It was more of the same against Georgetown, which beat Syracuse  
17-13 just three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orangemen trailed 4-1 late in the first quarter before  
rallying to a 5-5 tie at halftime. Chris Cordisc then scored twice 
as Syracuse reeled off four successive goals in a span of 3 
minutes, 18 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Byrnes added his second goal of the game and Marc Alexander  
scored at 10:56 to make it 11-5. 
</P>
<P>
	It was 12-5 before Mike Kanach scored for Georgetown with 10:40  
left, the Hoyas' first goal since Andy Flick found the back of the 
net with 7:57 remaining in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgetown's Scott Urick recorded his third goal of the game to  
make it 12-7, but Matt Cutia responded with his third goal of the 
afternoon to clinch the victory. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the 17th successive appearance in the Final Four by  
Syracuse and the first with John Desko as head coach. Desko served 
as an assistant under Roy Simmons, Jr. since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the two schools have an intense rivalry on the  
basketball court as members of the Big East, this was only their 
sixth meeting in lacrosse. Syracuse leads the series 4-2.

<HEADLINE> Airbus Confirms Sale of 57 Aircraft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Airbus has cut a deal to sell 57 airplanes, but  
will not disclose the buyer until later this year, the European 
consortium announced Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Airbus, based in the southern French city of Toulouse, would not  
reveal the price of the deal, but the sale represents more than a 
third of the 152 aircraft it has sold this year. The buyer asked 
that the order, signed April 30, not immediately be disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal could be officially announced at the Paris Air Show,  
which runs from June 13-20. 
</P>
<P>
	The order is important for the company, said Michel Guerard,  
vice president for corporate communications. He noted that last 
year was a record year for the consortium with 556 aircraft sold, 
while 1999 is, so far, a ``moderate year'' for sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Guerard confirmed French press reports of the so-called  
``undisclosed'' sale. 
</P>
<P>
	The order includes 30 of Airbus' new A318 aircraft, which seats  
107 passengers and is aimed at short routes. It is to be assembled 
in Hamburg, Germany, and is expected to be operational by 2002. 
Also in the deal are 14 A319s, 10 A321s and 3 A320s. 
</P>
<P>
	Airbus, the top competitor of Seattle-based Boeing Co., is owned  
by France's Aerospatiale, British Aerospace PLC, DaimlerChrysler 
Aerospace of Germany, and Construcciones Aeronauticas SA of Spain.

<HEADLINE> Actress Makes Pitch for Missing Dog </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KETTERING, Ohio (AP) -- Ohio native Sarah Jessica Parker is  
pitching in to help find a missing 9-year-old girl from suburban 
Dayton kidnapped while walking her dog. 
</P>
<P>
	Parker made a public-service plea about the case for TV and  
radio broadcasts, taping the spot last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm here to tell you about a missing child, Erica Nicole  
Baker,'' the Cincinnati native says. ``We need your help to find 
her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers sent faxes and letters to every celebrity they could  
think of -- particularly Ohio natives -- in attempts to enlist the 
celebrities' help. 
</P>
<P>
	``Essentially, Sarah Jessica did this because she was so moved  
by the story,'' publicist Ina Treciokas said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Erica disappeared Feb. 7 while walking her dog near her home.  
The dog was discovered nearby, but a massive search by police and 
volunteers found no clue as to Erica's whereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Remember, she's a living, breathing child and she wants to  
come home,'' Parker said. ``Please help Erica.''

</P>
<P>
	Perennial candidate and ex-Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke  
finished third in that race. 
</P>
<P>
	Treen lost despite endorsements from Livingston, Gov. Mike  
Foster and several powerful politicians. Vitter shrugged off the 
endorsements from ``the powers that be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They may have been the past, but we are the future,'' Vitter  
said to wild cheers from his supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Treen congratulated Vitter in his concession speech but also  
said Treen's campaign was guilty of several ``outright lies'' in 
the final days. A mailer that Vitter's camp sent out saying that 
Duke supported Treen was ``a complete lie,'' Treen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Treen ran as a well-connected insider with built-in seniority  
and valuable contacts owing to the seven years he served in 
Congress before being elected governor in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	Vitter, 38, hoped to use youth to his advantage, saying the  
70-year-old Treen's influence would be diminished because of his 
age. 
</P>
<P>
	Influence was the issue because Livingston, in a 20-year  
congressional career, proved adept at steering federal money to the 
home district, snagging federal funds for flood control projects 
and steering defense contracts to shipyards. 
</P>
<P>
	Livingston was chairman of the Appropriations Committee and in  
line to be speaker last year when he learned, as House members 
moved toward impeaching President Clinton, that news of his past 
marital infidelities was about to break. He confessed and resigned, 
urging Clinton to follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
	The runoff campaign was interrupted in its final week when  
Treen's 20-year-old grandson disappeared during a hike in the 
Oregon wilderness. He was found safe on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The final days of the campaign then got nasty. The candidates  
were in attack mode Friday evening during a debate on WWL-AM radio. 
</P>
<P>
	Treen denounced Vitter for putting out the mailers saying Duke  
supported the former governor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did put it out and it's true but I'm tired of having my  
integrity bashed by you. You're trying to have it both ways,'' 
Vitter responded. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke has not endorsed anyone but said he would vote for Treen  
over Vitter. 
</P>
<P>
	Some small position differences emerged between the two  
candidates during the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Vitter denounced all forms of gun control. Treen said he defends  
the right to bear arms but is not opposed to some restrictions on 
more sophisticated weapons automatic or semiautomatic weapons. And 
he said gun dealers at gun shows should be subjected to the same 
background check requirements as regular gun retailers. 
</P>
<P>
	Both said they opposed affirmative action but Treen also said he  
was against the federal government banning colleges and 
universities from deciding their own racial admission policies.

<HEADLINE> State Prosecutors Want Tripp Tapes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ELLICOTT CITY, Md. (AP) -- Maryland prosecutors have asked the  
federal judge overseeing a grand jury investigation of President 
Clinton for access to Linda Tripp's secret tape recordings of 
Monica Lewinsky, a newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
	State prosecutors filed the request with U.S. District Judge  
Norma Holloway Johnson, unidentified sources told The (Baltimore) 
Sun on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	A Maryland grand jury is considering whether Mrs. Tripp broke  
Maryland law by recording conversations with Ms. Lewinsky. If tried 
and convicted, she could get five years in prison and a $10,000 
fine. Ignorance of the law is a valid defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp turned over the tapes to Independent Counsel Kenneth  
Starr, triggering the investigation into the former White House 
intern's affair with President Clinton. In return, she received a 
federal grant of immunity from prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
	State Prosecutor Stephen Montanarelli has tried unsuccessfully  
since July to obtain the tapes, which remain in Starr's custody. 
</P>
<P>
	Montanarelli must establish independently that Mrs. Tripp made  
the tapes and knew that taping Ms. Lewinsky without her knowledge 
was illegal. Mrs. Tripp has declined to acknowledge publicly 
whether she made them.

<HEADLINE> Schnyder Dislikes Kournikova </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Anna Kournikova may be adored by the French fans,  
but she's not so well-liked by No. 11-seeded Patty Schnyder. 
</P>
<P>
	That's putting it mildly. The 20-year old Swiss player said  
after losing her match Saturday with the Russian star that she 
played badly because she so dislikes Kournikova. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a problem playing her,'' Schnyder said.  
</P>
<P>
	When asked if the problem was personal, she nodded in the  
affirmative. 
</P>
<P>
	This isn't the first time Schnyder's disike for Kournikova has  
affected her play. In April the two played each other in Florida at 
the Bausch &AMP; Lomb Championships and Schnyder seemed to tank the 
match. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hate playing (Kournikova) and I don't play if I'm on the  
court with her,'' said Schnyder afterward. ``It's her ... and 
everything around her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, Kournikova wouldn't speak about bad feelings  
between her and Schnyder. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know her personally at all. There are a thousand  
players on the tour,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	COMPUTER GAME-SET-MATCH: While most tennis players want peace  
and quiet before a big match, Marat Safin spends his time playing 
video games. 
</P>
<P>
	An hour before he won his third-round match against Hicham  
Arazi, the Russian was playing a jet ski video game in the players 
lounge. 
</P>
<P>
	Safin proved a talented player of that game as well; he was  
second on the top-scoring list. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	FRIENDS AND FOES: Gustavo Kuerten came to the defense of Marcelo  
Rios Saturday. Rios gets terrible press in France due to his often 
surly temperament. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Kuerten, Rios is a nice, regular guy.  
</P>
<P>
	``We are very good friends,'' he said. ``We kind of have the  
same culture, so we talk a lot about what we like, soccer, music,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	HELP NEEDED: Medical advice and good counseling is needed to  
help young female players determine if they're ready to be pros, 
Steffi Graf says. 
</P>
<P>
	When she started, Graf said, ``players used to be a lot  
skinnier, tinier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``What is surprising to me is those girls, 12, 14-years old,  
they already have bodies that don't look like 13, 14-year-olds,'' 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Not allowing young players to play a full schedule of  
tournaments, as some have suggested, wouldn't help, she said. Some 
are just ready to play at an early age and should get proper 
advice. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, those players learn about their body very early on.  
I mean, that's the kind of education I think that's most 
important,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Forbes Launches 2000 Campaign Ads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Multimillionaire businessman Steve Forbes is  
launching the first major advertising campaign of the 2000 cycle, 
laying out about $10 million this summer alone to get a jump on his 
GOP presidential rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	A heavy dose of television, newspaper and radio spots will  
appear this week -- 18 months before the general election -- in what 
campaign strategists say is the earliest-ever presidential ad 
blitz. 
</P>
<P>
	All but one of the TV ads are shot in black and white, some with  
a hand-held camera that captures Forbes discussing Social Security, 
taxes and his claim to be ``an outsider who's not a part of the 
political process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We will establish him as the agenda-setter in the campaign,''  
said Forbes' campaign manager, Bill Dal Col. He confirmed a 
national ad package would begin Wednesday, but did not provide 
details. 
</P>
<P>
	The initial four-week ad cycle will cost the Forbes campaign  
well more than $2 million, advisers say. That is more money than 
any GOP candidate except Texas Gov. George W. Bush raised in the 
first quarter of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	An internal memo obtained by The Associated Press says Forbes  
will start with seven different television ads airing nationwide on 
cable channels; a series of radio spots geared toward conservative 
listeners; and a full-page ad for national and local newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	He plans a steady stream of ads until the 2000 primaries,  
advisers say. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes, whose critical ads in 1996 staggered eventual GOP  
nominee Bob Dole, is starting out on the high road. ``Steve Forbes' 
message is positive and issue-driven,'' reads the memo. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes has been prepared for the 2000 campaign almost since the  
day he pulled out of the 1996 presidential race. Nonetheless, GOP 
polls place him far behind the front-runners, Bush and Elizabeth 
Dole, former president of American Red Cross. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes' advisers are hoping the ad campaign propels their  
candidate into the top tier of the Republican field. 
</P>
<P>
	Also made available to the AP were the TV ads.  
</P>
<P>
	Six of the spots, produced by Bill Eisner of Wisconsin, cast  
dark shadows across Forbes' face and frequently mimic the wobbly 
camera style made popular in TV action shows such as ``NYPD Blue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ads were recorded in a room at a hotel across a park from  
the White House, and offer a glimpse outside the window at the 
presidential residence. 
</P>
<P>
	The seventh ad is more traditional, with girls waving American  
flags as an announcer praises Forbes. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes offers few specifics in the advertising,  
</P>
<P>
	He promises to put Americans back in charge and ``let them have  
time with their families.'' He proposes individual retirement 
accounts because, he says, ``Politicians shouldn't raid the Social 
Security trust fund.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes says American needs ``a moral compass.'' He also wants to  
replace the tax code with one ``designed by a normal human being.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aides say Forbes' remarks were unscripted and gleaned from hours  
of tapings. According to the memo, the ads were shot in black and 
white to capture the feel of archival photography ``to help place 
Steve Forbes in presidential history -- to see him as president of 
the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper ad features a black-and-white photo of Forbes  
taken from the TV spots. 
</P>
<P>
	Superimposed at his feet are the yellowed pages of a textbook  
that says Forbes' ``possesses strong leadership skills from years 
of executive experience. And his financial independence allows him 
to champion the agenda designed to serve the public, rather than 
special interest groups.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes' first-out-of-the-box strategy is modeled after President  
Clinton, who commissioned ads early in the 1996 presidential 
campaign to define himself on a series of issues long before 
Republicans chimed in. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes plans to increase the size of his ad campaign in the fall  
and expand to Internet advertising, said a senior adviser, who, 
like all the sources, spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The TV spots are set to air on CNN, Fox News Channel and CNBC --  
with added emphasis in states critical to his nomination strategy: 
Iowa, New Hampshire, Arizona and California, advisers say. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper ad will appear this week in USA Today. Five papers  
in Iowa and New Hampshire will print the ad once a week for four 
weeks. The radio spot will air during Rush Limbaugh's conservative 
talk show, with the heaviest buys in Iowa and New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes also is mailing campaign flyers to 150,000 Iowa  
residents. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign expects to pay about $10 million for ads by  
summers' end, said the senior adviser. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Forbes' is financing much of the campaign out of his  
pocket, aides say they expect him to raise $3 million in 
traditional donations by the June 30 reporting period. That would 
put him on par with most of the GOP field.

<HEADLINE> Release of Autopsy Reports Denied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) -- Saying it would cause substantial harm to  
the community, a judge refused to release autopsy reports on 
victims of the Columbine High School shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	After 19 news organizations requested the records, families of  
the victims asked the judge to seal the material. The Denver Post 
and Denver Rocky Mountain argued the reports might shed light on 
the attack and help prevent further tragedies. 
</P>
<P>
	Jefferson County District Court Judge Henry Nieto ruled Friday  
that release of the reports would reopen wounds that are just 
beginning to heal. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like every member of this community has lost a child,''  
Nieto said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two students, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, charged into  
Columbine High School at lunchtime April 20, killing 12 of their 
classmates and a teacher before killing themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Family members wept as Nieto announced his decision. Attorneys  
for the two newspapers said they have not decided whether to 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, authorities pulled down the crime scene tape around  
the school on Friday, as school officials prepared to allow 
students into classrooms next week to pick up books and backpacks 
left behind as students fled the carnage. 
</P>
<P>
	Marilyn Saltzman, spokeswoman for Jefferson County schools, said  
the district plans to rebuild parts of the school damaged in the 
shooting and change the layout of some rooms like the library, 
where most of the killings happened.

<HEADLINE> Bench Is Key to Knicks-Pacers Series </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Forget the starters. It's the benches who  
may determine the Eastern Conference championship series between 
the Indiana Pacers and New York Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	For these are two of the NBA's deepest teams.  
</P>
<P>
	Latrell Sprewell, New York's leading scorer in the playoffs,  
comes off the bench and Marcus Camby has been a rebounding, scoring 
and shot-blocking force. Antonio Davis and Jalen Rose often play 
the key minutes for the Pacers. 
</P>
<P>
	Add Chris Dudley and Chris Childs for the Knicks and Travis Best  
and Derrick McKey and there's plenty of backup if the starters have 
an off night. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks arrive in Market Square Arena having won five  
consecutive playoff games for the first time in franchise history, 
while Indiana's reserves have helped make the Pacers the only 
undefeated team in the playoffs with sweeps of Milwaukee and 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	If the series comes down to bench play, Indiana's Mark Jackson  
likes his team's chances. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't played them since they've been rolling,'' Jackson  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel we have the best bench in the game. That's no  
disrespect to anybody else's. When you have two guys finishing in 
the top for the sixth man of the year award, when you have the 
other guys coming in that can start on a lot of other teams, we 
feel very strong about our bench.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis and Rose finished in a tie for third place in voting for  
the sixth man award. The 6-foot-9, 230-pound Davis is a body-banger 
inside and Rose heads into Sunday's game as his team's 
second-leading scorer in the playoffs with a 13.4 mark. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our bench has been an important part of our team. We play 10  
guys all the time and divide the minutes according to how they're 
playing,'' said coach Larry Bird, no stranger to playoff success 
from his days starring for the Boston Celtics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know how we can win. We need a focused concentrated effort  
from our bench to keep going. These guys say they want a 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``Talk is fine, now our starters and reserves will have a chance  
to show how hard they want it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Mullin said Sprewell, Camby and Childs make the Knicks a  
more potent team than the one Indiana eliminated in last year's 
conference semifinals 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've got a great card of bench players, great players. I  
don't know if you necessarily call them bench players because a lot 
of time they play as many or more minutes,'' said Mullin, a 
teammate of Sprewell's at Golden State. ``They've got a deep team 
and so do we. It's going to be important to not really worry about 
when you're on the floor, who you're matched up with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Effective play by Rose, Davis and McKey has cut into Mullin's  
playing time this season. That's of no concern to the veteran, who 
was the leading scorer against the Knicks this season with a 16.0 
average as Indiana won the season-series 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
	``You just go out there and play good minutes. If you play as  
hard as you can, and put it all together, that's what it's all 
about. It's not about how many minutes you play, how many shots you 
get, it's about winning the game,'' Mullin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose, meanwhile, wouldn't mind getting inside the heads of New  
York's players and some trash talk is as much a part of his game as 
his scoring. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a fine line between competing and bagging down. A lot  
of this game is mental and a lot of this game is played from the 
heart,'' Rose said about the trash talk. ``If you can intimidate a 
guy, and if you can get into a guy's head for one play, or one 
game, or for a whole season to get a win. That's what it is all 
about.''

<HEADLINE> Girl Dies in Struggle Over Gun </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. (AP) -- A girl who found a loaded, sawed-off  
shotgun on her 10th birthday died in a blast of buckshot after 
struggling with her 11-year-old brother when he tried to take it 
away. Their 8-year-old cousin was critically wounded in the 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	The accidental shooting Friday came after the girls found the  
12-gauge shotgun in nearby woods and started playing with it, 
police spokesman Ed Buice said. The boy was physically unhurt, but 
was treated for anxiety and breathing problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was pretty traumatized,'' Buice said.  
</P>
<P>
	The owner of the gun was charged with criminally negligent  
homicide, reckless endangerment and aggravated assault. Authorities 
say he tossed the gun while being chased by police earlier this 
month following a dispute with a local resident over a dog. Police 
would not release his name. 
</P>
<P>
	The 8-year-old was shot in the head and was listed in critical  
condition Saturday, T.C. Thompson Children's Hospital spokesman 
Todd Womack said.

<HEADLINE> Congress To Reenter Transplant Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Legislation circulating on Capitol Hill would  
remake organ transplant policy, giving the nation's transplant 
network virtually everything it has sought in a decade of disputes 
over who controls the distribution of scarce organs. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is the strongest challenge yet to the Clinton  
administration's effort to get organs to the sickest patients first 
-- even if they live farther away from the donor -- and to ensure 
that more data on the system is available to the public. 
</P>
<P>
	It comes as administration and transplant network officials  
resume closed-door talks in search of a compromise, nine months 
after the last round of talks broke off. 
</P>
<P>
	Years of tension between the Department of Health and Human  
Services and the United Network for Organ Sharing came to a head 
last year after HHS issued regulations overseeing the network's 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Most controversially, they require that organs be given to the  
sickest patients first. The current system relies heavily on 
geography, with patients located inside certain boundaries getting 
first chance at donations. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Congress stepped into the fight, suspending the  
controversial change until this fall. It also ordered an Institute 
of Medicine study of the system, which is expected in July. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the House Commerce Committee is poised to intervene again.  
The draft legislation would give the network, which runs the 
computers that match organs and recipients, virtually total control 
over allocation policy. 
</P>
<P>
	It would also allow the network to keep its budget secret and  
make it virtually impossible for HHS to contract with a different 
group to run the network. It also allows the network to keep secret 
data on the survival rates of patients at various hospitals and to 
disclose when a transplant center is under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Michael Bilirakis, R-Fla., chairman of the Commerce health  
subcommittee, plans to introduce the bill next month and hopes it 
will be approved by the full panel this summer, said Todd Tuten, a 
Bilirakis aide who is helping to draft the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuten emphasized that the bill is still in draft form and could  
change before it is introduced, noting that it was based on the 
views of transplant surgeons and hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	He said it stems from continued frustration over HHS's  
regulation. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a concern about government bureaucrats making life  
and death allocation decisions,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	HHS says it is looking out for patients. The wait for a  
transplant varies significantly depending on location. In recent 
years, for instance, a typical liver patient waited less than two 
months in one part of the country but more than two years in 
another. 
</P>
<P>
	But the current system is supported by many transplant centers  
that rely on a local supply of organs to support their programs. If 
the organs followed the patients, many fear, they would flow to a 
few large centers, leaving smaller programs out of business. 
</P>
<P>
	Those transplant centers have bound together to fight the HHS  
rules, mounting a large lobbying campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, as the lobbying continues, HHS and network officials  
have returned to the table in an effort to reach a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
	A two-day meeting was held in early May, and the parties plan to  
meet again soon. Unlike talks last summer, these are more 
constructive as officials look for areas of potential agreement, 
said an HHS official who is part of the discussions. 
</P>
<P>
	A network spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said  
his side is cautiously optimistic that they can reach a resolution. 
But network officials had no comment on the proposed bill. 
</P>
<P>
	HHS is less optimistic about the pending legislation. The  
official, also speaking on condition of anonymity, called it ``an 
entire wish list'' for the network.

	New Nigerian Leader Takes Office  
</P>
<P>
	ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) -- Olusegun Obasanjo became Nigeria's first  
civilian leader in 15 years today, expressing hope for a prosperous 
future for a nation tormented by years of dictatorship. Gen. 
Abdulsalami Abubakar, who during his 11 months in power has guided 
Nigeria peacefully through its transition to democracy, handed over 
power to Obasanjo. Africa's most populous nation, Nigeria has been 
governed by soldiers for all but 10 years since independence in 
1960. It has suffered dramatically under military rule and 
Obasanjo, who won February's presidential elections, faces a wealth 
of problems.

	NATO Jets Pound Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO jets struck hard today at Serb  
forces in the Kosovo province. NATO said its aircraft ``enjoyed 
considerable success'' on day 66 of its air campaign, aimed at 
forcing Yugoslavia to withdraw troops from Kosovo and allowing 
840,000 ethnic Albanian refugees to return under the protection of 
an international peacekeeping force. NATO said in a statement this 
morning at its headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, that alliance 
planes had flown 639 sorties, including 218 strike sorties, in the 
previous 24 hours. It said targets hit included at least 17 
artillery pieces and two tanks in Kosovo.

	Indian Continues Kashmir Strikes

<P>
	DRAS, India (AP) -- Indian jets unleashed more attacks on Islamic  
guerrilla targets today in the disputed region of Kashmir, despite 
an offer from Pakistan to hold talks to diffuse tensions over the 
Himalayan territory claimed by both nuclear powers. India demanded 
the Pakistani government rein in its military, which New Delhi 
accuses of backing the guerrillas' incursion into the Indian-held 
part of Kashmir and their capture of mountain outposts. The Indian 
air force has been conducting strikes since Wednesday against 
positions held by the guerrillas, who India says include Pakistani 
soldiers disguised as militants.

	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Pakistan has asked Secretary-General Kofi  
Annan for help in trying to reduce tensions with India. The 
neigbhboring nuclear rivals, embroiled in a conflict with India 
over Kashmir, have fought two of their three wars over the remote 
Himalayan region that lies between them. Pakistani Prime Minister 
Nawaz Sharif asked Annan to beef up the U.N. military observer 
mission in the disputed frontier, initiate a dialogue between India 
and Pakistan and dispatch a U.N. envoy to the region.

	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Discovery docked with the new  
international space station early today for six days of activities 
that include a spacewalk, repair work and supply transfers. The 
link marks another milestone for the new outpost, which was last 
visited by astronauts in December. With shuttle commander Kent 
Rominger at the controls, Discovery pulled up and latched on to the 
space station as it soared 240 miles above the border of Russia and 
Kazakstan. The crew will venture all the way inside the outpost for 
the first time Sunday, when they begin their maintenance work and 
start transferring two tons of supplies into the station.

	L.A. Doctors Vote To Unionize  
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Hundreds of Los Angeles County doctors voted  
to unionize yesterday. They became part of a growing number of 
physicians across the nation who are unionizing, a trend stemming 
from the growing influence of health maintenance organizations and 
the belief that administrators have assumed too much influence over 
patient care, the doctors said. The 790 county doctors, many of 
whom care for the poor and uninsured, joined the Union of American 
Physicians and Dentists on a 341 to 182 vote, or 65 percent to 35 
percent.

bookings since late yesterday for flights flying in the next two 
weeks ``to ensure the situation is under control,'' an airline 
spokeswoman said. Passengers who have already booked their flights 
are not affected, she said. Cathay has an average of 116 flights 
daily. Cathay lost $69 million last year, the first loss in 35

French Open, and in return, he might have received the ovation of 
the year. Trying to close off a rally, Agassi's opponent, Chris 
Woodruff, sent a near-perfect lob sailing over Agassi's head into 
the corner. Agassi sprinted back to the baseline, caught up with 
the lob, and, his back to the net, whacked the ball through his 
legs and hit a clean winner. Agassi defeated Wooduff, a fellow 
American, 6-4, 6-4, 6-3 to reach the round of 16 and a matchup 
against defending champion Carlos Moya.

<HEADLINE> Hun Sen Attends Son's US Graduation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST POINT, N.Y. (AP) -- Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen  
attended his son's graduation from the U.S. Military Academy on 
Saturday, a visit that some objected to because of human rights 
abuses by the former Khmer Rouge fighter. 
</P>
<P>
	Hun Manet, who was among 934 cadets receiving diplomas, became  
the first Cambodian to graduate from West Point. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a pride for the nation as a whole,'' Hun Sen said  
through an interpreter after the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	The government's decision to grant Hun Sen a visa to watch his  
21-year-old son graduate sparked some protests in Congress among 
members concerned over the leader's human rights record. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., who attended the ceremony, said he  
was concerned about how Hun Sen deposed a co-prime minister in 1997 
in a bloody coup that left dozens of people dead. But Gilman added: 
``As a father, I guess he's certainly entitled to be here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Khmer Rouge leaders were responsible for widespread atrocities  
that occurred during their 1975-79 rule of Cambodia. An estimated 
1.7 million people died from harsh conditions and systematic 
executions during the guerrilla group's Maoist-inspired attempt to 
establish a communist society. 
</P>
<P>
	Hun Manet, dressed in the traditional gray blouse and crimson  
sash, smiled and gave a white-gloved thumbs-up as he received his 
diploma. He followed tradition and tossed his cap into the air 
after all of the graduates had received their degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	The economics major plans to pursue a graduate degree at New  
York University, but said he still must serve in the Cambodian 
military. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have four years commitment at home, just like my friends,''  
Hun Manet said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hun Manet was admitted into the academy under a long-running  
program that sets aside slots each year for non-American cadets. 
The idea is to generate international goodwill and inculcate 
American military ethics and values abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	West Point officials did not specifically invite Hun Sen, but  
said they would grant him the courtesies they would any visiting 
parent. 
</P>
<P>
	Hun Manet is described by acquaintances as a solid student who  
fit right in to the Long Gray Line. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Army Chief of Staff Dennis Reimer had sobering words for  
the new officers, noting that the recent graduates had time and 
again led troops ``in harm's way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no reason to think your fate would be any different,''  
Reimer said.

<HEADLINE> Revolution 4, MetroStars 3, SO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Giovanni Savarese scored two goals  
in his first game against his former MetroStars teammates and the 
New England Revolution beat New York-New Jersey in a shootout after 
playing a 3-3 tie tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	John Harkes scored the only goal in the shootout and backup  
goaltender Jeff Causey, who came on in the final two minutes of 
regulation time, didn't let the MetroStars beat him in giving the 
Revolution a 4-3 win. 
</P>
<P>
	Ivan McKinley scored the other goal in regulation as New England  
snapped a two-game losing streak. Eduardo Hurtado, Arley Palacios 
and Brian Kelly scored for the MetroStars, who lost their second 
straight. 
</P>
<P>
	The game was the opener of a doubleheader at Giants Stadium that  
also featured an exhibition between Colombia and El Salvador. It 
attracted 43,192 fans, the largest crowd to see an MLS game this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	The MetroStars and Revolution came into the game each having  
scored eight goals in their first nine games, but both found their 
scoring touches. 
</P>
<P>
	New England, which had not scored a goal in 340 minutes, scored  
twice in 13 minutes to take a 2-1 lead at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
	McKinley tied the game at 1-1 by running on a chip pass from  
Harkes in the box and heading it past Mike Ammann in the 21st 
minute. The play appeared to be offside. 
</P>
<P>
	Savarese, the MetroStars' all-time leading scorer with 41 goals  
before being traded to New England in the offseason, put the 
Revolution ahead in the 34th minute, converting in close off an 
assist by Joe-Max Moore. 
</P>
<P>
	Palacios, a Medellin resident, delighted Colombian supporters in  
the crowd by tying the game on a 25-yard free kick in the 50th 
minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Savarese put the Revolution ahead again in the 54th with his  
second goal and fourth of the season. It was another play where he 
got behind the defense and no offside was called. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Kelly tied the game four minutes later, running onto a  
nice pass across the crease by Hurtado and knocking the ball into 
an open net. Hurtado had given the MetroStars a 1-0 lead in the 
sixth minute, scoring after New England starting goaltender Walter 
Zenga gave up a rebound on a Nansha Kalonji shot in the sixth 
minute.

<HEADLINE> Keyes Cuts Into Conservative Base </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUBUQUE, Iowa (AP) -- Alan Keyes scowled at the 200 or so folks  
who had jumped to their feet in applause after his lengthy diatribe 
on America's evils. 
</P>
<P>
	``All that clapping doesn't mean anything unless you make a  
commitment to doing something,''' Keyes, who is making another bid 
for the GOP presidential nomination, said as aides passed out 
volunteer cards. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the first political thing we've ever gone to,'' said  
Sharleen Hackley, gesturing at husband, Warner. ``The fact that he 
is here is remarkable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Filling a void, she said, is Keyes, a conservative  
African-American who argues abortion and a decline in religion are 
behind the nation's woes. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are things that are missing in our politicians today,''  
she said. ``He is very real.'' But a potential GOP nominee? 
</P>
<P>
	``I really don't know that he has a real chance of winning,''  
Mrs. Hackley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Far below the radar of national politics, Keyes is readying for  
another run for the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	He has a committee that allows him to travel to key early  
states. It is a shoestring operation compared with some rivals. 
Still, aides say they are happy with the way things are going. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, Keyes showed a speaking style that could energize an  
audience, particularly conservatives, and captured 7 percent of the 
Republican vote in Iowa's leadoff precinct caucuses. Some 
strategists believe his presence prevented social conservatives 
from coalescing around a single candidate against Democrat Bill 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Since that election, Keyes has held more than 30 ``renewing  
America'' meetings in Iowa, where precinct caucuses launch the 
presidential nominating season. 
</P>
<P>
	His appearances largely go unnoticed by reporters focusing on  
bigger-name contenders. Still, they draw impressive, say Iowa 
political leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's high on my list,'' said Daniel Nicholson, a city  
councilman from Dubuque. ``He has a message that none of the rest 
of them have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Keyes twice ran for the U.S. Senate in Maryland, worked at the  
State Department official and was a radio talk show host with a 
gift for the rhetorical flourish that warms conservative hearts. 
</P>
<P>
	He spares neither Democrats nor Republicans, criticizing ``a  
political elite so utterly estranged from any connection to the 
people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though Keyes has gotten little attention, he has the potential  
to split the votes of social conservatives who like his message 
even though his chances of winning seem remote. 
</P>
<P>
	``He draws very large crowds and he has very enthusiastic  
support,'' said Marlys Popma, political adviser to conservative 
activist Gary Bauer. ``I don't know if he's real.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added Bob Haus, an aide to publisher Steve Forbes: ``He's not  
afraid to tackle some of those tough issues and people respond to 
that message.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some in the party say Keyes could help to shape the policy  
debate during the early stages of the campaign even if he is not a 
realistic contender. 
</P>
<P>
	``In smaller, early states he can be a force,'' said a former  
Iowa Republican chairman, Richard Schwarm. ``In bigger states later 
on he will fade.''

<HEADLINE> 'Star Wars' Fans Swap Inside Trivia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Did baby talk really inspire the chattery  
beeps and squawks of R2-D2? 
</P>
<P>
	Was the Millennium Falcon starship modeled on a hamburger with  
an olive next to it? 
</P>
<P>
	Burt Reynolds considered as Han Solo?  
</P>
<P>
	True. True. And false.  
</P>
<P>
	With fans flocking to see ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom  
Menace,'' urban legends surrounding the films have become more 
plentiful than Yoda's grammatical mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of Web sites full of ``Star Wars'' trivia have popped up  
and newly enthusiastic fans are sharing insider tidbits like 
popcorn in freewheeling chat rooms. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a quasi, national geek-pastime to studiously examine the  
existing films,'' said Paul Alvarado-Dykstra, a contributing editor 
on the movie-fan Web site aint-it-cool-news.com. ``It's hard to 
draw the line between what is really definitive or what is 
reinvented.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spurious rumors have reached director George Lucas' headquarters  
at Skywalker Ranch in Novato, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	``My favorite was the one about Kenneth Branagh playing Obi-Wan  
Kenobi, which was never true,'' said Lynn Hale, a Lucas 
spokeswoman. ``Everybody insisted he had the role, even after we 
said Ewan McGregor was cast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alternate casting is a favored item of ``Star Wars'' gossip,  
with fans speculating that everyone from Burt Reynolds to 
Christopher Walken were once signed to play rogue starship pilot 
Han Solo, the role that eventually made Harrison Ford famous. 
</P>
<P>
	``George says the Burt Reynolds claim is false,'' Ms. Hale said.  
Walken was in the running, eventually losing out to Ford. 
</P>
<P>
	But is it true Sissy Spacek was the first choice for Princess  
Leia? 
</P>
<P>
	As rumor has it, Carrie Fisher was playing the lead in the 1976  
Stephen King thriller ``Carrie'' but clashed with director Brian De 
Palma because she refused to do nude scenes. Spacek was reportedly 
unhappy with ``Star Wars,'' so the two actresses decided to switch 
roles. 
</P>
<P>
	``No way,'' said Ms. Hale, laughing.  
</P>
<P>
	Some of the seemingly ridiculous legends are true.  
</P>
<P>
	For instance, your mind isn't playing tricks on you if a  
gigantic potato or tennis shoe appears to float past the Millennium 
Falcon during its perilous flight through asteroids in ``The Empire 
Strikes Back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Employees at Industrial Light &AMP; Magic threw the items in as a  
joke. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucas says he really was inspired to design the Millennium  
Falcon while staring at a hamburger with an olive next to it. 
</P>
<P>
	Even erroneous rumors associated with ``Star Wars'' sometimes  
have roots in reality. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Sound designer) Ben Burtt imitated the coos and babbling of  
babies and ... altered that sound to make the voice of R2-D2,'' 
said Ms. Hale. ``But he never used real babies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was Burtt's fondness for using familiar, everyday noises  
rather than digitally created sound effects that led to the rumor 
that some ``Star Wars'' creatures say outrageous sentences in Earth 
languages. 
</P>
<P>
	In ``Return of the Jedi,'' the cuddly Ewoks are rumored to speak  
a Filipino dialect and occasionally say things such as ``Det luktar 
flingor har,'' which is Swedish for ``It smells of corn flakes 
here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The speech patterns may be similar to those languages, but  
that's about all,'' Ms. Hale said. ``(Burtt) likes to use elements 
of real languages to form the ones used by these creatures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the latest hot topics among Star Wars aficionados?  
</P>
<P>
	E.T., Steven Spielberg's famous extraterrestrial, makes a  
background appearance in ``The Phantom Menace.''

<HEADLINE> Chicago Regains Control of Housing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Deborah Young remembers the last time the city  
was in control of its public housing. 
</P>
<P>
	The 15-year resident of the Chicago's Robert Taylor Homes said  
roaches and rats infested her South Side building and officials and 
residents were mired in apathy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was utter chaos. There were no services; the buildings were  
filthy and dangerous. It was as if everything had come to a stop,'' 
Young said. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government stepped in and seized the Chicago Housing  
Authority in 1995. After that, Young said, ``We went from being 
hopeless and traumatized communities to communities with hope.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, nearly four years after the Department of Housing and Urban  
Development's takeover, the federal agency is returning the 
troubled CHA to local control. 
</P>
<P>
	Young wonders if Mayor Richard Daley's administration is up to  
the task of running the approximately 62,000 unit system. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know their plans for us. It's a matter of whether  
they can keep moving in the right direction,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a huge task,'' Daley said. ``It won't happen  
overnight. It will take years to complete. We all must be willing 
to experiment and learn as we go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago officials and HUD signed an agreement restoring the  
city's control of the CHA on Thursday, nearly nine months after the 
agency was removed from a federal list of troubled housing 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	HUD stepped in after a series of scandals, including allegations  
that a former board chairman embezzled millions of dollars from the 
housing authority's pension funds. At the time, HUD Secretary Henry 
Cisneros said the CHA was ``without question, the worst public 
housing in America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Current HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo called the return to local  
control a ``vote of confidence in the good work'' of Daley and the 
CHA to improve living conditions in public housing. 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph Shuldiner, who was sent by HUD to run the housing  
authority, said rampant mismanagement has been eliminated while 
economic opportunities have increased for residents through job 
training programs and small-business initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
	HUD also has awarded more than $100 million in grants for  
rehabilitation. Some buildings have been torn down; others have 
been modernized. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been able to give the CHA back its credibility, ''  
Shuldiner said. 
</P>
<P>
	But not everyone considers the CHA's development under HUD an  
unequivocal success. 
</P>
<P>
	Roberta Feldman, an urban planner with the University of  
Illinois at Chicago, acknowledges more efficient management of the 
CHA has allowed more funds to make their way to the housing 
complexes. 
</P>
<P>
	But many of the challenges -- including keeping crumbling and  
aging complexes livable -- remain, she said. And new problems have 
cropped up because of a shift in government policy on public 
housing that has called for the demolition of some 10,000 public 
housing units in Chicago in favor of mixed income housing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many residents are feeling anxious about whether they are  
going to have a home,'' Feldman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Daley's appointment of Phillip Jackson as the CHA's new  
executive director is seen by some as a cause for optimism. 
Jackson, a former Chicago public housing resident, has been a top 
administrator for the city's school system. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Jackson) is going to relate to residents and challenge the  
residents. He is going to be tough-minded and tender-hearted,'' 
said Rep. Danny Davis, a Democrat whose district contains about 68 
percent of Chicago's public housing complexes.

<HEADLINE> What Reggie Miller Do This Time?  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Nothing quite captures the spirit of the  
Knicks-Pacers rivalry than the memory of one of Reggie Miller's 
greatest moments. 
</P>
<P>
	Madison Square Garden, May 7, 1995: Eight points in the final  
8.9 seconds, six of them coming on 3-pointers right in front of 
Spike Lee's courtside seat. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the quintessential Miller moment, a Knick-killing  
sequence that remains so vivid in the minds of the Indiana Pacers 
that they were talking Saturday like it happened just yesterday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Watching Spike Lee, watching his face during that period after  
all the talking, it was good to watch his face,'' Mark Jackson 
recalled. ``It was almost like he was watching the final edit of 
one of his movies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Rik Smits: ``If I had to pick one game, it would be the  
eight points in the last seconds of that game. I scored 34, but he 
came up big.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody knew it at the time, but Miller's 8.9-second outburst  
would usher in a four-year period in which the Knicks would not be 
able to get out of the second round of the playoffs. Now New York 
is back in the Eastern Conference finals for the first time since 
1994, playing an Indiana team that has been this far in the 
playoffs three times, only to lose a Game 7 each time. 
</P>
<P>
	Game 1 in the best-of-7 series tips off at 5:30 p.m. EDT Sunday  
at Market Square Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller himself wasn't talking about anything Saturday in keeping  
with his recent persona of being Mr. Anti-Inflammatory. 
</P>
<P>
	He gave no insight into his famous 8.9 seconds in 1995, his  
25-point fourth-quarter against the Knicks in Game 5 of the 1994 
conference finals, or his 3-pointer in New York during Game 4 of 
last season's second-round playoff series -- another shot from right 
in front of Lee's seat. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't particularly like him too much in New York, and he  
probably feels the same way about this organization,'' the Knicks' 
Latrell Sprewell said. ``But he obviously respects us, and this 
city respects him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This will be the fifth time the teams have met in the playoffs  
in the past seven seasons. The Knicks beat Indiana 3-1 in the first 
round in 1993 and 4-3 in the conference finals in 1994. The Pacers 
defeated the Knicks 4-3 in the second round in 1995 and 4-1 in the 
second round in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``Indiana still has a lot of the same players, but we've changed  
personnel so much,'' said New York coach Jeff Van Gundy, who has 
been through all the Pacers-Knicks series either as an assistant 
coach or a head coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy will bring a different version of the Knicks into  
Indianapolis, a team more inclined to run and gun than the old New 
York teams that would pound the ball into the low post and watch 
Patrick Ewing operate. 
</P>
<P>
	With a younger, more athletic second unit that includes Sprewell  
and Marcus Camby, the Knicks will try to force the tempo against a 
Pacers team that remains perfectly happy in a slow-down, half-court 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pacers won the season series 2-1, winning decisively in the  
two games at Market Square Arena and losing by one point in the one 
matchup at Madison Square Garden. But both those games have little 
meaning now. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks have turned things around over the past six weeks,  
finishing the regular season strong, beating Miami in the first 
round of the playoffs and then sweeping the Atlanta hawks in the 
second round.

<P>
	The Pacers, meanwhile, have been nearly flawless, sweeping both  
Milwaukee and Philadelphia in the first two rounds of the playoffs 
as part of an 11-game winning streak they'll bring into Sunday's 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	Both teams have had plenty of rest heading into this series.  
Indiana hasn't played since last Sunday, while New York has been 
off since Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Two or three days of rest would have been fine,'' Smits said.  
``This is getting old. It's been a long, long week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So long, in fact, that the Pacers have had time to dissect the  
journalistic merits of a quote by Jackson -- he called the Pacers 
``the champs'' -- that was turned into a back-page headline in one 
of the New York tabloids. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson contends the comment was an innocuous one.  
</P>
<P>
	``Friends have faxed me stuff, and family members have called  
and told me what was going on,'' he said. ``It gets old. It's sad, 
really. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really don't care,'' said Jackson who grew up in New York  
and started his career with the Knicks. ``What are they going to 
do, boo me? They did that when I played there, so it doesn't make 
any difference.''

	BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) -- They followed their mother everywhere:  
to the Laundromat, to church, to America. They followed her down 
the railroad tracks and into the path of Amtrak's Twilight 
Shoreliner as it tore through the night. 
</P>
<P>
	Pedro, 3; Angel, 6; Jose, 10; and Carlos, 11. Their friends say  
they followed their mother to heaven. 
</P>
<P>
	Julia Toledo was a tiny woman with a bright smile whose children  
charmed the neighborhood. The Pied Piper, some neighbors called her 
as they watched the happy brood: the boys dressed up in dark suits 
when they marched to church on Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 47-year-old mother's cheerful front hid problems. She  
had no money or health insurance. Her marriage had collapsed and 
her husband had returned to Ecuador. She spoke little English. 
</P>
<P>
	Toledo worried about her children's safety. She worried about  
keeping her family together. In America, she was told, the state 
can take your children if you are not a good mother. 
</P>
<P>
	She didn't wait to find out. Early Tuesday morning, Toledo  
packed up her boys and her Bible and crept out of the homeless 
shelter where they had spent their last few nights. Their bodies 
were found shortly after 2 a.m. on a railway trestle, surrounded by 
schoolbooks and sneakers and Sesame Street figurines. The conductor 
tried to stop, but at 71 mph he didn't stand a chance. 
</P>
<P>
	``As soon as I heard the news, I knew it was a peasant woman  
from the Andes that was walking down the tracks,'' said the Rev. 
Gustavo Falla of St. Charleschurch, where Toledo and the boys 
attended mass. The tracks would have represented the most direct 
route to another town, he said, and Toledo might have felt safer 
there than walking through the dark streets of a dangerous city, so 
different from the mountain farming village she had left behind. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think she was very brave leading them out of whatever  
trouble they were in, and looking for a future for herself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Toledo's search for a better future began 18 months earlier,  
when she left Ecuador to come to America. She had little more than 
a blind faith in her sister's promise that it was a better place. 
Maria Toledo had emigrated years earlier. Other siblings had 
emigrated, too. They owned houses. They spoke English. How good 
America had been to them. 
</P>
<P>
	There wasn't much to hold Toledo to her homeland. In the lush,  
green fields of the southern Andes, her husband, Carlos Urgiles, 
had scraped a living as a farm laborer. Their remote village of 
Cojitambo, 160 miles southwest of Quito, isn't even marked on a 
map. 
</P>
<P>
	Life was poor, simple and hard. But the streets of Bridgeport  
proved harder. 
</P>
<P>
	The city's East Side is a warren of cracked pavements,  
burned-out buildings and crumbling multifamily homes. It's a place 
where neighbors look out for each other and strangers are viewed 
with suspicion. A place where police prowl in cruisers looking for 
drugs and guns. And kids grow up fast. 
</P>
<P>
	``This place makes you bitter,'' said Erik Young, a 14-year-old  
neighbor who looks 18 and talks with the disillusionment of someone 
older. ``It's no place to raise kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He sat with his father on a rickety, litter-strewn stoop on  
Shelton Street. A few houses down, the Toledo boys had blossomed. 
</P>
<P>
	Polite, immaculately dressed and groomed, they would walk with  
their mother to the Luis Munoz Marin Elementary School a few blocks 
away. After school, they would play on the street, or help neighbor 
Angel Rivera plant tomatoes, or feed his rabbit. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was an excellent mother,'' said Rebia Ebron, a retired  
factory worker who lives across the street. ``I don't care where 
she went, she never went without the kids. And she never let them 
out past dark.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carlos, the oldest, set high standards, winning a young author's  
prize for his essay on a rainforest. Happy-go-lucky Angel was the 
family joker, while little Pedro could charm quarters from 
neighbors with his huge brown eyes and adorable smile. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jose is the child the neighbors talk about most. For two  
days, the 10-year-old clung to life after the train severed his leg 
and shattered his head. Everyone said it was better when he finally 
slipped away. 
</P>
<P>
	With him slipped answers: about his mother, about their life,  
about what had driven her out of the house owned by her sister and 
onto the tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	His death also brought more questions, especially at school  
where classmates had been busy drawing get-well cards for him. 
</P>
<P>
	``What do you tell the children?'' asks school principal  
Milagros Vizcarrondo. ``How do you explain that Julia was a good 
mother trying to give her family a better life? How can anyone 
understand the hardships facing a single mother who is poor and 
uneducated and so far away from home?'' 
</P>
<P>
	School officials knew Julia Toledo. She felt comfortable asking  
them for advice about where to get food and clothing. They knew she 
had moved into a shelter, although they didn't know why. Neighbors 
spoke of a growing rift with her sister. Her estranged husband 
blamed it on religion. 
</P>
<P>
	In poor neighborhoods like Bridgeport's East Side, there are  
often holy wars for an immigrant family's soul. 
</P>
<P>
	Maria Toledo is an active member of the Church of Jesus Christ  
of Latter-day Saints in Trumbull, and Julia had gone there too. 
Church elders visited in their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	But according to Falla, Julia Toledo hadn't relinquished her  
Roman Catholic faith. She still attended Mass at St. Charles. She 
was seen at other local churches, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think she was searching for spirituality,'' said Sister  
Brenda Lynch of the Caroline House, a neighborhood educational 
center for immigrant women. ``Or maybe she was just looking for 
help.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But even in death the struggle over their souls continues.  
</P>
<P>
	Carlos Urgiles arrived from Ecuador on Friday night intending to  
return home with the bodies of his wife and sons for burial. His 
sister-in-law, Maria, said he is abusive and fled to his homeland 
last year rather than risk arrest. He said he left his family last 
year over religious differences with his sister-in-law and because 
he couldn't find a job and his mother was ill. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to bring the bodies to my country. I don't want  
problems with my family,'' said Carlos Urgiles, speaking through an 
interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
	Maria planned to bury her sister and nephews in a Connecticut  
cemetery on Monday. Ultimately, both sides met Saturday and agreed 
to bury the family in Connecticut. Urgiles, who was granted a 
humanitarian visa for the trip, will return to Ecuador after the 
funeral. 
</P>
<P>
	As Julia's struggles mounted, none of the places she turned to  
sensed a crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	A school social worker was scheduled to meet with Julia and  
Maria Toledo on Tuesday, the day the younger sister died on the 
tracks. Shelter officials had arranged the meeting after Maria 
Toledo called looking for Julia. 
</P>
<P>
	Was Julia afraid of the outcome, afraid that with no place to  
live, her children would be taken from her? 
</P>
<P>
	Was she fleeing to another shelter, or to another part of  
America where she could hold on to her children, and maybe her 
dreams? 
</P>
<P>
	At Caroline House, she listed her occupation as ``cortar pelo''  
-- hairdresser. She proudly hung a beautician's certificate from 
Ecuador in her apartment. But she knew she needed English to work 
as a beautician, to earn anything more than her wages as a janitor 
at Fairfield University. She studied English diligently at Caroline 
House in morning classes, before heading to work the 4 p.m. shift. 
</P>
<P>
	``She refused to speak Spanish. She wanted to grasp English. She  
knew how important that was,'' said assistant history professor 
Walter Petry, who specializes in Latin America and who would 
readily have spoken Spanish. They would greet each other every day, 
exchanging pleasantries, as she started her shift in Canisius Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	Like others, Petry talks with anguish at how ignorant he was  
about Julia Toledo's plight. She quit her job about a week before 
the accident, and though Petry noticed her absence he said he never 
asked where she had gone. 
</P>
<P>
	``One professor came into my office in tears, saying we should  
have done more,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	So many people are saying the same thing.  
</P>
<P>
	Outside the Shelton Street house, neighbors come in a steady  
stream to place flowers on the porch. A candle flickers on a 
plastic chair. Nearby, Pedro's toy dump truck is filled with 
daisies. New memorial services are announced daily by neighborhood 
groups, schools, churches. 
</P>
<P>
	At the university, some faculty members are going further,  
crafting a proposal to grant the children of janitors free tuition 
once their parents work there for several years. They want to help 
others' children follow in a direction Julia Toledo hoped to lead 
her boys. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to do something,'' Petry said, ``to make sure she  
didn't die in vain.''

<HEADLINE> Sports Transformed in 20th Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Imagine no pro football, basketball or hockey.  
And no baseball heroes, no Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa, in a world 
where players were seen as a raucous underclass of roustabouts. 
Imagine no landmark games, and no instant replays to brand great 
moments on the country's psyche. No agents. No endorsement 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	You're imagining sports at the start of the 20th century, when  
games were little more than recreation, light years removed from 
the multibillion-dollar industry they are today. 
</P>
<P>
	How did sports evolve from pastime to big time?  
</P>
<P>
	How did we go from the sandlot game to the Super Bowl half-time  
show, with sponsors snapping up commercial time at $50,000 per 
second? 
</P>
<P>
	Many factors changed the picture.  
</P>
<P>
	There were monumental personalities -- like Babe Ruth and  
Muhammad Ali -- whose style as well as their athletic talents 
electrified fans. 
</P>
<P>
	There was a decade-by-decade increase in leisure time, allowing  
people to play and watch sports such as golf and tennis. 
</P>
<P>
	And of course, there was the phenomenal growth of the mass  
media: First, radio broadcasting college football across the 
country -- Notre Dame, Harvard-Yale, Army-Navy -- and then 
television, where routine game coverage was transformed forever by 
the vision of Roone Arledge. 
</P>
<P>
	``I found in sports a combination of drama, grace and beauty,  
from the heroic highs of winning to the terrible lows of losing,'' 
said Arledge, the longtime ABC Sports executive, who now heads the 
network's news division. ``Certain things were common -- the 
settings, the people who try to achieve and how difficult that is, 
the human drama of people. Those elements are always there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arledge saw sports as a vehicle for television, and television  
made sports big business. 
</P>
<P>
	In programs like ``Wide World of Sports'' and Olympic coverage,  
he used the technology of television to put a human face on the 
athletes, to show their off-the-field lives, their family 
struggles. Since every sport had human stories, he widened the 
spectrum of what to cover. 
</P>
<P>
	``We went around the globe and televised sports people never  
thought of -- gymnastics, figure skating, track and field,'' he 
said. ``With close-ups and slow motion, you could see the emotions 
and expressions. It gave intimacy to the athletes and the events.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't sports anymore,'' said Dick Ebersol, chairman of NBC  
Sports. ``Here are the people who do the jumping and running, the 
`up-close and personal.' He was taking people like Jean-Claude 
Killy in the Winter Olympics and George Foreman in the Summer 
Olympics and making them personalities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arledge had a golden touch. When NBC and CBS turned down a  
proposed prime-time series of NFL games, ABC scooped it up. Now 
entering its 30th year, Monday Night Football is the longest 
running prime-time entertainment series in television history. 
</P>
<P>
	``Roone saw two things,'' Ebersol said. ``Sports was ready for  
prime time and the athletes should be portrayed as personalities, 
not just sports figures. It's amazing TV didn't see this before. 
Before, it was just between the lines coverage. ... He turned the 
way sports are done inside out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And with it, sports turned inside out.  
</P>
<P>
	Television paid huge rights fees to cover events. Most recently,  
four networks -- Fox, CBS, ABC and ESPN -- paid $17.6 billion for 
eight years worth of NFL games. 
</P>
<P>
	Athletes like Ali and Michael Jordan became world figures. Ali  
tours the globe as an envoy for peace. And when Jordan retired in 
January, headlines from Tokyo to Egypt lamented the news, an 
Italian newspaper observing: ``He's way better known than 
basketball itself ... Jordan is myth, poetry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leagues doubled and sometimes tripled in size. Today, Major  
League baseball has 30 teams in six divisions, with divisional 
playoffs and league championship series adding to World Series 
interest and revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	It's easy to forget that it wasn't always this way.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1900 America, baseball was the only sport played on an  
organized basis. And then, it wasn't always so organized, with 
player raids by rival leagues often disrupting operations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Baseball was beginning to come of age from 1900 to 1914,''  
said Benjamin Rader, a professor of history at the University of 
Nebraska who specializes in sports. ``Early in the century, the 
major leagues began building parks of concrete and steel instead of 
gerry-built wood stadiums that often moved from one place to 
another. It suggested permanence. It was a symbolically important 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The players were vagabonds, shuttling from team to team and  
league to league. And the owners were constantly battling the 
athletes and each other. Baseball historian and author David Nemec 
believes things haven't changed all that much. 
</P>
<P>
	``Andrew Freedman, owner of the New York Giants, posed a notion  
that big-market teams turn baseball into a monopoly and share the 
profits, based on size,'' Nemec said. ``Freedman was a stingy 
owner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Owners exercised great power: Even stars like Honus Wagner and  
Nap Lajoie had little recourse when their salaries were frozen in 
1900. Players could be fined or forced to sit out a whole season 
for infractions. 
</P>
<P>
	``The owners were industrialists who owned public utilities.  
They weren't sportsmen, they were businessmen, in it to turn a 
profit and make their businesses more profitable,'' Nemec said. 
``Still, it was the only pro sport a guy could play to make a 
living.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As troubled as baseball was, it was still ahead of the other  
sports, which were more loosely organized. 
</P>
<P>
	Football was a college activity, reserved for rivalries like  
Yale vs. Harvard. It wasn't until 1920 that George Halas, Art 
Rooney and their buddies met in a Canton, Ohio, automobile showroom 
and launched the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	Barely a decade had passed since Dr. James Naismith wandered  
into the YMCA gym at Springfield, Mass., in 1891, looked up at the 
balconies and asked a custodian to nail up a couple of peach 
baskets, one at each end. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years after Naismith positioned the custodian's ladder,  
Frederick Arthur, formally known as Lord Stanley of Preston, 
purchased a handsome trophy for 10 guineas -- about $50 -- to be 
presented to the amateur hockey champions of Canada. It would 
become the National Hockey League's prized Stanley Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though the NHL did not get under way until 1917, the NFL  
until 1920 and the NBA until 1946, each sport bid for attention 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Splinter leagues and barnstorming teams existed everywhere.  
Perhaps the most successful were the Original Celtics, who took 
Naismith's game on the road with players like Dutch Dehnert, Nat 
Holman and Joe Lapchick on display for as little as 65 cents a 
ticket. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Lapchick, director of Northeastern University's Center  
for the Study of Sports in Society, recalls the tales his father 
told. 
</P>
<P>
	``During the Depression, they couldn't afford hotel rooms,'' he  
said. ``They'd drive all night from town to town. The size of the 
team depended on the number of players they could squeeze in their 
car. If they got seven in, two would share the driving while five 
slept.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then there was the matter of economics. Lapchick said his father  
was the team's highest-paid player, but consider: 
</P>
<P>
	``In 20 years, his cumulative salary was what Chris Webber made  
in the first quarter of his first game as an NBA rookie. In his 
30-year coaching career, he was the highest paid coach around and 
cumulatively he made what (Duke coach) Mike Krzyzewski makes in his 
annual shoe contract.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By the 1920s, sports were establishing a real foothold in the  
fabric of the country. It was the Golden Age of Babe Ruth and Jack 
Dempsey, Bobby Jones and Bill Tilden, Red Grange and Sonia Henie. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Winston, a professor of sociology at Eckerd College, said  
1920 was a turning point for the country as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was the first year we were more urban than rural, when  
the population shifted,'' he said. ``Baseball came from an 
agricultural past. That caused a significant change in the way we 
view sports.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ruth may have been most responsible for that. He dragged  
baseball from the dead ball to the long ball, hitting 60 home runs 
in 1927, a mark surpassed only three times since. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides, he had a presence that compelled people to pay  
attention to baseball. Radio broadcasting, then in its infancy, 
greatly broadened the audience. A ``running description'' of the 
World Series was first broadcast in 1921. 
</P>
<P>
	``When Ruth stepped forward, attendance shot up,'' Nemec said.  
``The New York teams became prominent. The 1921-22-23 
Giants-Yankees World Series were the first ones to gain national 
attention.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ruth wasn't alone in capturing the imagination of a country  
enjoying postwar prosperity. Dempsey's raw power as heavyweight 
champion made him a boxing hero. Jones and Tilden dominated the 
country club sports of golf and tennis. Grange was the cornerstone 
of the NFL and Henie the figure skating darling of the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	With sports flourishing, the National Hockey League expanded to  
10 teams -- now it has 27 with three more to be added in the next 
two years -- and placed a franchise in New York's Madison Square 
Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	Murray Murdoch, 94, the oldest surviving NHL player, was an  
original Ranger, playing 11 seasons before coaching hockey for 38 
years at Yale. 
</P>
<P>
	``The game today is much better,'' he said. ``Everything's been  
done to get the attack to start.'' Scores were lower, players were 
on the ice for far longer before switching, he said. ``When I 
played, there was no slap shot. But there was a kick shot. You 
could kill somebody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And the fans were different from today's hollering throngs.  
``Hockey was a prep school game in the old days and that helped the 
pros. It was a society sport,'' Murdoch said. ``Those people came 
to see us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Golf and tennis appealed to the same population. When Jones won  
golf's Grand Slam in 1930, he was given a ticker-tape parade up 
Broadway. When Don Budge did the same thing in tennis in 1938, 
there was no parade, but plenty of satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to do something no one else did,'' said Budge, now  
83. 
</P>
<P>
	He has seen the game change dramatically. ``The rackets are  
faster and the balls are slower,'' he said. And he doesn't like the 
delays between points nowadays. ``They'll have a chaise lounge out 
there some day,'' he grumbled. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest change is money.  
</P>
<P>
	``When I won Wimbledon, I got zero,'' Budge said. ``I got a  
trophy. Now it's half a million dollars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Byron Nelson, 87, tells a similar story. In 1945, he won 18 golf  
tournaments including an unbelievable 11 in a row. Altogether he 
won 66 tournaments. Some of the purses were so small the PGA 
doesn't bother listing them. Nelson won them. He lists them. His 
career earnings: $182,000. 
</P>
<P>
	And what was his reward for the 11-match winning streak?  
</P>
<P>
	``Well, I got some Wheaties,'' he said, recalling the cereal  
brand's decision to put him on the box. ``But not until I won seven 
or eight in a row.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There were no sporting goods company contracts, no television  
money for the Murdoch-Budge-Nelson generation of athletes, though 
from early days some ballplayers were paid to promote products like 
tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was in the middle of the 20th century, after World War  
II, that sports began to become big time. 
</P>
<P>
	An Associated Press poll chose Jim Thorpe as the football player  
and male athlete of the half-century. Thorpe, an American Indian, 
declared the world's greatest athlete when he won the pentathlon 
and decathlon in the 1912 Olympics, played professional baseball 
and football for 20 years and was commissioner of the football 
league that became the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	The female athlete of the half-century was Babe Didriksen  
Zaharias, winner of the women's javelin and 80-meter hurdles at the 
1932 Olympics. She was also a champion golfer, winning 14 straight 
tournaments during a 12-month stretch in 1946-47. In 1954, a year 
after being diagnosed with colon cancer, she won the U.S. Women's 
Open by 12 strokes. 
</P>
<P>
	Sports in the first half of the century was largely the province  
of white men. Henie and Zaharias were among the first women to make 
an impact. Later, tennis star Billie Jean King led a modern-day 
assault on the status quo and Title IX legislation guaranteed equal 
opportunity for women in collegiate sports. 
</P>
<P>
	Like women, blacks were largely excluded from organized sports  
except in boxing, where first Jack Johnson and then Joe Louis ruled 
as heavyweight champions. 
</P>
<P>
	That changed in 1947, when Jackie Robinson became the first  
black man in this century to play major league baseball. He had 
played in the Negro Leagues, a separate and hardly equal operation. 
</P>
<P>
	``In symbolic terms, Jackie Robinson was as important as Rosa  
Parks and the Supreme Court decision,'' Rader said. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson integrated baseball 11 years after track star Jesse  
Owens made history at the 1936 Olympics at Berlin. Owens won four 
gold medals and broke or tied Olympic records nine times. With 
Adolf Hitler's racist policies hanging like a shroud over the 
event, a black American became the hero. 
</P>
<P>
	Other Olympians would win more medals but none under the  
circumstances faced by Owens, the grandson of slaves. His 
performance also helped make the Olympics a big deal, a quadrennial 
celebration of sports that gradually turned into a major property 
for television networks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Olympics is the single best brand in the world,'' said NBC's  
Ebersol, who purchased rights for the games through 2008. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got Sydney and Salt Lake City in August, 1995 for $1.25  
billion. Then, 3 1/2 months later, we got the unnamed games for 2004, 
2006 and 2008 for $2.3 billion. That's $3.5 billion before you get 
into production costs which is another $100 million per games. So 
it is more than $4 billion in expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're talking about big time. But it's the last guaranteed  
family viewing in American television.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the money television pours into sports, the industry has  
changed dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
	Athletes were once flattered when fans asked for autographs. Now  
they get big fees for signing at shows organized by promoters. It 
is part of a big bucks landscape that includes huge contracts like 
$126 million for teen-aged basketball player Kevin Garnett and $105 
million for pitcher Kevin Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	Franchises must generate record revenues to support their  
payrolls and when the income levels dip, they often move to new 
cities that offer sweetheart stadium deals. When leagues need more 
revenue, they simply add expansion teams. 
</P>
<P>
	If some fans are turned off, others view these things simply as  
part of what defines sports as a mega-industry now. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no way to get the genie back into the bottle, to  
contain sports somehow in its pastime past. It cannot be returned 
to a time, which may never have really existed anyway, of simple 
games played by simple heroes.

<HEADLINE> Dead Man Blamed in Wash. Rampage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Authorities on Saturday were still trying to  
understand what sent a man on a killing spree, but first they had 
to tally the dead and wounded: his mother and nephew stabbed to 
death, a woman fatally beaten, another woman critically injured, a 
motorcyclist run over and a sheriff's deputy shot. 
</P>
<P>
	Believed to be responsible for it all was 22-year-old Lonnie  
Davis, who was shot dead by a police sniper after a standoff with 
police in a northern suburb of Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis had previous run-ins with the law in King County but no  
known history of violence, Brier Police Chief Gary Minor said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we're ever going to know what set him off. At  
this point, we don't have a clue,'' he said. ``We don't know that 
he had a history of any mental problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It started with the deaths of Davis' mother, Sheila Lindsey, 46,  
and his sister's son, Kahari Prince, 18 months. The two were 
stabbed to death with a three-inch paring knife Friday morning, 
probably around 10 or 11 a.m., Minor said. 
</P>
<P>
	The killer changed out of his bloodied jeans and T-shirt and  
left without washing up. 
</P>
<P>
	At about 1:30 p.m., Lindsey's black Honda station wagon swerved  
into a motorcycle on Interstate 5 in Shoreline, located in King 
County a few miles south of Brier. 
</P>
<P>
	The motorcyclist, Anthony Venegas, 64, was rushed to the  
hospital and had his leg amputated below the knee. 
</P>
<P>
	The car was torn in half and burned. Davis fled on foot into a  
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	Moments later, a resident called 911 when she heard Erma Spence  
screaming for help. 
</P>
<P>
	Spence, 63, was found lying in her yard in a pool of blood, with  
what looked like a broken posthole digger -- a garden tool -- near 
her body. She was pronounced dead at a local hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	The man then attacked 82-year-old Irene Hilton in her yard,  
hitting her with an object and breaking her neck and critically 
injuring her, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff's officers say the man then found an empty house that  
contained a large number of weapons and started firing at officers. 
Deputy Diana Russell was hit in the head by flying glass and a 
ricocheting bullet. She was in serious condition on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	King County Sheriff Dave Reichert said his officers responded  
with just the single sniper shot. The officers then fired three 
rounds of tear gas into the home, at 15 minute intervals, to make 
sure the man was down, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The sniper's shot was meant to kill, Reichert said.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a sad thing and it's a tough decision to make,'' he said,  
``but in this case it was the right thing to do.''

<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Rick Pittman was overwhelmed as he gazed up  
at the names etched in the glass of the new Medal of Honor 
Memorial. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's awesome,'' the 53-year-old Vietnam veteran said at  
Friday's dedication of the first monument to the 3,410 recipients 
of America's highest distinction for military valor. 
</P>
<P>
	Pittman and 92 other Medal of Honor recipients were the first to  
see and touch the monument to their heroics, built on the banks of 
a canal that runs through downtown Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wear these medals, not for ourselves, but for those who  
served with us and whose work went unseen,'' said Paul Bucha, who 
earned the medal while serving in the Army in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
	At the close of the ceremony, a giant curtain of American flags  
parted so hundreds of onlookers could see the memorial; the 
audience exploded into a standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
	The monument's 27 curved glass panels rise above the canal,  
representing 15 military conflicts dating to the Civil War. At 
dusk, the monument will play recorded stories -- narrated by some of 
the servicemen. 
</P>
<P>
	Loved ones scoured the panels Friday for names etched in glass  
alongside their branch of service and the site of their heroic act. 
Cries of ``Here, you are!'' echoed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tremendous,'' said medal-bearer Lewis Millett, a 78-year-old  
Korean War veteran from Idyllwild, Calif. ``I can't believe it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	IPALCO Enterprises Inc., a holding company for the electrical  
utility that serves Indianapolis, spent $2.5 million to build the 
memorial. It also paid to bring to Indianapolis as many surviving 
Medal of Honor recipients as possible for the dedication over 
Memorial Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just ordinary men, and we were very fortunate to do  
deeds that were seen,'' said Stephen Gregg, 84, of Bayonne, N.J., 
who dodged gunfire and grenades to give cover to a medic who 
rescued seven wounded soldiers in France during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	The medal-bearers were to serve as grand marshals of the  
Indianapolis 500 Festival Parade today, and will ride around 
Indianapolis Motor Speedway before Sunday's big race.

<HEADLINE> Islanders Trade Linden to Montreal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNIONDALE, N.Y. (AP) -- The New York Islanders trimmed their  
payroll Saturday when they traded center Trevor Linden to Montreal 
for the Canadiens first-round pick in this year's entry draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Linden, 29, has signed a four-year contract with the Canadiens.  
He was to become a restricted free agent on July 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a tough decision,'' Islanders general manager Mike  
Milbury said. ``He's a class act and a good player. I won't kid you 
-- there were financial considerations in moving him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Linden, the Islanders captain, made $2.5 million last season. He  
had 18 goals and 29 assists in 82 games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't want to be traded and I didn't ask to be traded,''  
Linden said. ``I'll miss the guys I played with. Going to Montreal 
is exciting because it's the center of hockey.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Islanders received the 10th overall pick in the draft for  
Linden, who was traded to the Islanders in February of 1998 after 
nine seasons with the Vancouver Canucks.

<HEADLINE> Rangers Beat Celtic 1-0 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GLASGOW, Scotland (AP) -- The Glasgow Rangers defeated Old Firm  
rivals Celtic 1-0 Saturday on Rod Wallace's second-half goal to add 
the Scottish Cup to this season's league and League Cup titles. 
</P>
<P>
	Wallace got his 27th goal of the season after four minutes of  
the second half, scoring on a left-footed volley from five yards 
that got behind Celtic goalkeeper Jonathan Gould. 
</P>
<P>
	The match was played under tight security following a May 2 game  
between the two that the Rangers won 3-0 to take the league title. 
More than 100 fans were arrested and referee Hugh Dallas' head was 
gashed by a coin thrown from the stands. 
</P>
<P>
	This match went off without incident on the field with Dallas  
again in charge and swarms of disappointed Celtic fans leaving 
before the final whistle. 
</P>
<P>
	The most controversial play came in the 88th minute when Rangers  
captain Lorenzo Amoruso -- standing in the box -- was struck in the 
upper arm/shoulder area by a driving shot that was headed for the 
goal. Celtic players called for a penalty on a handball, but Dallas 
waved it off. 
</P>
<P>
	Playing for the fifth time this season after one victory each  
and two ties, both sides had a scoring chance in an evenly played 
first half before a sellout of 52,000 at newly refurbished Hampden 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Celtic's Paul Lambert hit the crossbar on a long volley in the  
21st minute and Wallace broke into the box all alone in the 27th 
only to lose control of the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers, who have won the league title 10 of the last 11  
seasons, pulled off the same triple in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The Scottish Cup title was the Rangers' 28th, second to the 30  
won by Celtic. It was also the 13th time that Scotland's two most 
bitter rivals have met in this final with Celtic having won the 
previous three times. Celtic still leads 7-6 in those showdowns.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Spice Girl Gets Help From Friend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Who does a troubled British pop star turn to in  
a time of trouble? Another troubled British pop star, of course. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Spice Girl Geri Halliwell, whose temperamental departure  
from the group made tabloid headlines worldwide, took comfort from 
George Michael, whose career has included bad publicity, like his 
arrest for lewd behavior in a Los Angeles-area public bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
	``George really looked after me,'' Halliwell says in the June US  
magazine. ``After I left the band, I was completely isolated. It 
was like being on a very crowded street and then getting into a car 
and shutting the door. I was lonely, and he showed me so much 
warmth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since ending her run as Ginger Spice, Halliwell has done charity  
work and made her debut solo album, ``Schizophrenia.'' In the 10 
months or so since the highly publicized Spice Girls' bickering and 
breakup, Halliwell said she finally has some perspective. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm actually starting to get nostalgic now,'' she said. ``I  
can look back and understand things more.''
