<P>
   TOKYO _ As a samurai, Hakuo Yanagisawa would have never bothered
to sheathe his sword. He spends his time feinting and darting and
backing his adversary _ Japan's banking system _ against the wall.
The establishment seems ready to yield.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after Yanagisawa took over as chief regulator of
Japan's banking system last fall, word raced through town that two
bank presidents had committed suicide. It wasn't true, but it
captured the fear felt by bank executives that Yanagisawa's demands
on them would be unbearably taxing and that their jobs might no
longer be secure.
</P>
<P>
   Yanagisawa has suggested that he wants fewer banks. He has
bullied five banks into pulling out completely from international
business. And others have caved in to his demand that they abolish
the deeply ingrained practice of ``sodanyaku,'' in which former top
executives continue to draw large salaries and retain a
company-paid car and driver until the day they die.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Yanagisawa, a 63-year-old member of Parliament,
shrugs off the talk of suicides and undue pressure. He argues that
his rule is harsh only in comparison to the Finance Ministry
officials who, he says, governed the banks for years ``tenderly,
like a mother.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are absolutely not giving the Japanese financial
institutions the cruel treatment or giving them an impossible or
unsolvable agenda,'' he said. But, he added pointedly, ``I am
convinced that this is a time of change.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Resolution Trust Corp. in the United States, which
simultaneously shut down numerous savings institutions and bailed
out many others, the Financial Reconstruction Commission that
Yanagisawa heads will rely on a combination of carrots and sticks.
</P>
<P>
   Yanagisawa and other government officials say the banks wiped
off all the bad debt from their books on March 31, the end of the
fiscal year. They set aside $77 billion, enough both to cover the
bad debt and provide a cushion for good debt that might go bad.
</P>
<P>
   The day before, the banks buttressed their weak cushion of
capital when the government funneled in large chunks of cash in a
bid to restart the recessionary economy. The government hopes that
the infusion of $64 billion will encourage banks to take more
lending risks, thus easing the credit squeeze.
</P>
<P>
   Yanagisawa is attaching some strings to the money. He demanded
agendas for restructuring, which now include cutting one in three
board directors on average.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, when banks distribute their preferred shares to the
government, in return for taxpayers' money, they will have to watch
their stock prices closely. If a bank's stock slides, then the
government could increase its stake when it converts its preferred
shares, which do not carry voting rights, into common stock. In
some cases, like that of Daiwa Bank, the government could start
stepping up its voting stake beginning as early as June.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time in Japanese banking history that the
share price is important to management,'' said Robert Zielinski, a
banking analyst at Lehman Brothers in Tokyo. ``If they let the
share price drop, they might be owned by the government.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Yanagisawa is hardly a radical. A former Finance
Ministry official, he rose in the bureaucracy as an elite graduate
of Tokyo University. As a politician he has defended farmers, a key
constituency. He rarely drinks more than one beer at a time and he
does not play golf. His idea of a good time is a walk through a
modern art museum with his wife, a woodblock artist.
</P>
<P>
   And though his aides leap when Yanagisawa calls, especially to
nightly meetings that often end at 10 p.m., they say he takes good
care of them, sometimes ordering take-out for those who work until
2 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Yanagisawa contends that Japan is near the end of its eight-year
battle with bad debt, and an increasing number of financial experts
_ while still worried about Japan's enormous economic problems _
are encouraged by the growing sense that banks will not collapse
and throw the system into shock.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Yanagisawa has been winning plaudits where it
counts _ in the marketplace. The stock market is up some 20 percent
from its low in October and bank shares have leapt 65 percent since
then. Some overseas hedge funds and other investors are betting
that the worst has passed and that the potential for gains now
outweighs the risk of further losses.
</P>
<P>
   The changes inside the banking system may seem to come slowly,
but progress is being made. Bank executives are losing their
bonuses, salaries are being cut, and more and more employees are
afraid of being fired. Banks are re-evaluating their customers,
writing off loans, calling in others or demanding partial
repayment. They are unloading unwanted real estate, as well as
selling some bad loans.
</P>
<P>
   The Financial Supervisory Agency, which Yanagisawa's commission
oversees, says it plans to set up an electronic monitoring system
at the banks over the summer, and it is considering sending in
full-time inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there has been a lot more talk than action, and
Yanagisawa has critics. For one thing, no one believes that the
banks' books are clean just yet. The present estimate of $77
billion in bad debt is only a tiny fraction of the various
estimates that previously made the rounds _ $650 billion and higher
_ though it is unclear whether previous estimates were too high or
the present one too low.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say the banks need to anticipate at least another
$85 billion in bad-debt disposal next year, and even more public
money, especially if the economy retreats again.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've put some stability under the tottering structure, but
they haven't repaired it,'' said Alicia Ogawa, managing director at
Nikko Salomon Smith Barney. ``They have a lot of good policy out
there. The question is: Is the government really going to enforce
it? Judging from recent history, there's not a lot of good hope.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Others complain that key decisions about the banks were based on
hasty inspections. Teams of 10 inspectors from the Financial
Supervisory Agency spent more than two months pouring over the
books of each bank, but their work may be suspect because many had
previously worked in the Finance Ministry, which has been seen as
too gentle on the banks.
</P>
<P>
   Yanagisawa has been trying to boost the credibility of his
watchdogs, and he refused to move into the same office compound as
the Finance Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese bankers themselves are skeptical about rapid change.
One Japanese executive said real change could come only when his
generation retired. Another banker said that unless senior
management sets a good example, it would be hard to impose changes
in pay scales, eradicate lifetime employment or curb pension and
other benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``My worry is that by the time the FSA says they will fire
management, I think it will be too late,'' said the banker. ``The
problem that many banks face is that they can't make the tough
decisions to invest in new businesses when their mission now is to
fire and get rid of the bad loans.''
</P>
<P>
   Japan's banking system faces a number of obstacles before it
regains its balance, much less before it becomes internationally
competitive. Banks need to catch up in technology _ they are not
even fully linked to the Internet _ and transform the way they
perceive and perform their business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem in the Japanese banking system now is that they
are not making money,'' said a senior official at the Financial
Supervisory Agency. ``The challenge they face is to look for new
businesses where they can expect higher profitability.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time in Japan, there are new young entrepreneurs,'' he
added, speaking on the condition he not be identified. ``I hope the
banks would help people take over old traditional sectors and
enterprises in Japan, so that each enterprise becomes more active
in taking risks.''
</P>
<P>
   While some analysts are encouraged by the new direction, they
say Yanagisawa's commission, which is supposed to oversee the
supervisory agency for another two years before its mandate
expires, must keep up the pressure. Otherwise, the banks will lapse
into old habits.
</P>
<P>
   One worry is that the financial supervisors are stretched too
thin. With banking reform on track, the agency now wants to turn to
the problems at smaller, local financial institutions, as well as
to the billions of dollars in bad debts burdening the insurance
industry. But it cannot afford to ignore the banks.
</P>
<P>
   The government demanded detailed plans from the banks on how
they would refocus their businesses, but Yanagisawa was
disheartened to find that almost all of them chose the same path:
to strengthen their retail business. The problem, he says, is that
banks still aim to protect stakeholders _ employees in particular _
rather than the shareholders who nominally are the owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can call it the Japanese character if you want, but I can
definitely say that all of corporate management, not just the
management at banks, is stakeholder management, not shareholder
management,'' said Yanagisawa. ``And they are inclined all to look
at what other banks are doing. They want to be in a stable
condition together. And considering the future of the Japanese
industry, that is a little bit of a headache.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone acknowledges that any progress will be slow. Hideichiro
Hamanaka, deputy commissioner at the supervisory agency, lit some
incense _ perhaps for good luck _ and likened Japanese banks to
aircraft carriers, which require time to adjust to a new heading.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new direction for the Japanese financial companies has
been set,'' he said. ``One or two years down the road the new
direction will be evident.''

MAGIC DEFEAT KNICKS, 81-72 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Patrick Ewing rubbed his eyes and let out a sigh as
he stared into the distance long after the questions stopped.
</P>
<P>
   The more frustrated he sounded, the harder he pounded a lotion
bottle into the palm of his hand. Usually, Ewing is the nonchalant
one, the one unruffled by defeats.
</P>
<P>
   This one got to him. The Knicks blew an 11-point, third-quarter
lead under a barrage of turnovers and a stretch of panicked play
against a Magic team that seemed to toy with the Knicks before
putting them away, 81-72, on Tuesday night at Madison Square
Garden.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks fell to 0-5 against the two teams above them in the
Atlantic Division, Orlando and Miami. They collapsed under 22
turnovers and another horrendous effort in the fourth quarter. This
time, the Knicks (18-16), who fell out of playoff position, made
just 6 of 24 shots down the stretch. When the Magic (26-10) felt
like it, it turned on a 21-5 run and gulped up the Knicks' 11-point
edge in the first five minutes of the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm mad at myself,'' said Latrell Sprewell, who missed all
five shots he took in the second half and turned the ball over five
times on the night. ``I didn't give the team what they needed. We
had them in the first half. We played well. But we seemed to get
big-headed about it. I don't know.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disturbed, really upset. We're running out of time. So,
yeah, this is as upset as I've been.''
</P>
<P>
   Led by Anfernee Hardaway's 30 points, the bulk of which were
scored around the lethargic defense of Allan Houston, the Magic
took control in the second half. The Knicks did all of their damage
in the first half. Ewing had 16 of his 28 points, while Houston
scored 10 of his 14. When it counted, everyone vanished.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am at a loss for words,'' Chris Childs said. ``I guess we
are a one-half team. We are not a good team. We don't play with
urgency. We don't play with the kind of emotion we need for a whole
game. When we get down, we don't play with any emotion
whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Jeff Van Gundy had no sense for what kind of effort he was
going to get from his team against the Magic. There was motivation.
The Knicks had lost to the Magic twice already this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think more than feeling good about ourselves, we have to
know what it takes to win,'' Van Gundy said before the game. ``I
think sometimes, and I always read about teams having fun, but
that's all bull. You have fun when you win, and when you play
right. You shouldn't be having a whole lot of fun if you're not
doing the right thing. You feel good when you're winning.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks were giddy in the first half because they were
playing the right way. They were soothing Van Gundy's anxiety of
their perimeter defense by holding the Magic to 0 for 7 from
3-point range and just 27.7 percent from the field.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Knicks were shooting a stirring 53.8 percent to
take a 44-33 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   The look of glee on the Knicks' faces faded in the third
quarter. The Magic tuned up its defensive energy and forced four
turnovers in the first seven minutes of the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Each mental collapse by the Knicks was topped by another. During
the Magic's 21-5 run to pass the malfunctioning Knicks, Hardaway
was shaking Houston for 11 points.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the Magic was ahead, 54-49, with five minutes left in
the third, a startling turn of events. The Knicks regrouped and
used a 3-pointer and a layin by Ewing to regain the lead and take a
shaky 57-56 lead into the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   It was closer than anyone imagined based on the Knicks'
first-half performance. Playing with efficiency, the Knicks'
attention to detail on both ends of the floor led them to a
12-point lead in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   They had the strength of Ewing's 16 first-half points, and they
remained unusually composed when they rode out a brief run by the
Magic, which was able to cut the Knicks' lead to 3 points. One
energetic spurt later, and the Knicks held an 11-point lead at the
break.
</P>
<P>
   For once, the Knicks were playing in sync. Often, Houston and
Sprewell have operated like independent parts.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night was no different, but with Larry Johnson healthy
enough to get back in the starting lineup, Sprewell came off the
bench for the first time in two games. Before he came in late in
the first quarter, Houston looked comfortable in his familiar role
next to Ewing and made three of his first six shots.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell entered the game, and Houston stepped into the
background. This has been a disturbing trend since the Sprewell
trade was made on the premise that he could play next to Houston.
It didn't matter, though, because Sprewell was on a roll himself.
Sprewell was 3 for 4 and scored 10 first-half points.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever path the Knicks took in the first half, it worked. The
same could not be said for the rest of the game.

SMOKING BY TEENS LINKED TO DNA HARM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY STEVE CARNEY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- A new study shows that teen-age smokers, even if
they quit later, cause themselves long-term genetic damage that
increases the risk of lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The study, published today in the Journal of the National Cancer
Institute, shows that early smoking hinders the body's ability to
repair smoking-related damage later in life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's another reason for kids to really think hard about
smoking,'' said the lead author, John K. Wiencke, director of the
Laboratory for Molecular Epidemiology at the University of
California, San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think they can quit and later on there will be no harm
done. That may not be true.''
</P>
<P>
   But several San Fernando Valley teen-agers seem no more
concerned about this study than others that have shown the dangers
of smoking young.
</P>
<P>
   ``Studies are studies. People are going to do it anyway,'' said
Carlos Cardenas, an 18-year-old senior at suburban Van Nuys High
School, puffing on a chocolate-flavored Black &AMP; Mild cigarillo
Tuesday. ``It's not an addiction, it's more of a habit. We'll grow
out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of like a handicap,'' Wiencke said. ``You may not be
able to go back exactly to the way you should've been.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers who surveyed 143 lung-cancer patients did not set
out to study teen smoking, Wiencke said, but found it to be a
common thread. He said the patients with the most genetic damage
started smoking when they were young -- one at age 7.
</P>
<P>
   The two-year study was funded by federal grants from the
National Cancer Institute and the National Institute of
Environmental Health Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with those who picked up the habit later, participants
who began smoking in their teens had many more adducts, compounds
that latch onto the DNA and are thought to promote lung cancer. And
they had levels 3{ times higher than nonsmokers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would make sense. The body is more vulnerable at that
point,'' said Judy Sopenski, executive director of Stop Teen-age
Addiction to Tobacco, based at Northeastern University in Boston.
``When a young person is developing, a whole lot is going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocky Rosen, director of the Free For Life stop-smoking program
in suburban Canoga Park, started smoking when he was 13 and quit 14
years ago when he was 32.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we start as kids, we feel it's innocuous, but pretty soon
it's the center of our lives,'' he said. ``It's the forbidden
fruit. I had a sense of invulnerability and a sense of fatalism at
the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosen said he started puffing ``to be hip, to be cool, to be
sophisticated, to be a bad boy, to be a rebel, and it's no
different today.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas, the Van Nuys High School senior, said he smokes to
relax. ``It cools you down when you're stressed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not good,'' admitted his friend Felipe Villalobos, 18, of
North Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what is?'' Cardenas cut in.
</P>
<P>
   Smoking with a half-dozen friends in front of a Jack-in-the-Box,
Camilo Novoa, an 11th-grader at Taft High School in suburban
Woodland Hills, dismissed the smoking study.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad's been smoking since he was 17, and he's healthy as a
horse,'' said Novoa, 17 himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``And there's a lot of people who don't smoke who get lung
cancer,'' chimed in Alex, a 16-year-old 10th-grader who declined to
give his last name.
</P>
<P>
   The study should not be used as an excuse to continue smoking,
Wiencke said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a fatalism, and you say what's the use,'' he said.
``That's not what the science says. That's just wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Anytime someone quits smoking, that person's risk of lung cancer
decreases, but repairs take longer for someone who started smoking
young, Wiencke said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a reason to not stop smoking,'' he said. ``It's a
reason to do it sooner than later.''

RADIO STATION BILLBOARD SPARKS ANGRY CALLS IN L.A.
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY PHILLIP W. BROWNE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- A billboard leasing company will remove dozens of
cryptic radio promotions that read ``Is your son's coach gay?''
after receiving at least 80 angry -- and some threatening --
telephone calls, officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The billboards were part of a Southern California promotion
launched Monday by radio station KFI-AM (640), which also drew
attention in 1995 for controversial O.J. Simpson billboards.
</P>
<P>
   The latest billboards have ``severely disrupted business'' so
much at Outdoor Systems Billboard Leasing that they will be removed
when the weather allows, a company employee said.
</P>
<P>
   At least two billboards were placed in the suburban San Fernando
Valley northwest of downtown, in Van Nuys and North Hollywood, as
part of what KFI calls a ``teaser campaign,'' designed to spark
community discussion about controversial issues, station marketing
director Stuart Turner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to ask questions that get people's blood boiling or
make them laugh, and get them talking,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently it worked too well.
</P>
<P>
   ``One guy threatened to come down here,'' said Steve, an Outdoor
Systems employee who declined to give his last name. ``I've
received about 70 or 80 calls in the last two days and they are
coming down no matter how KFI feels.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to worry about the safety of the people coming in
and out of the building,'' Steve said.
</P>
<P>
   KFI marketing consultant Bill Louis said he understands the
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a business to run, and they are responsible to their
land holders,'' Louis said. ``When there have been problems with
our campaigns in the past, we've had no problem changing or
removing them.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles gay and lesbian advocates said the question on the
billboard wasn't offensive in and of itself, but they were
concerned the campaign could be followed by an answer that might be
offensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those billboards usually change within a week or two, and we
weren't sure if they would say `So what?' or `Get rid of the
coach,' '' said Corri Planck, a spokesperson for the Gay and
Lesbian Center in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there was some lapse in judgment at KFI, but we're
happy they are coming down.''
</P>
<P>
   The KFI campaign included about 100 different questions, such as
``Why do you cheat on your wife?'' and ``Who is reading your
e-mail?'' But the gay coach question sparked a barrage of concerns,
Turner said.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Morgan was outraged by a billboard in Van Nuys near the
intersection of Victory Boulevard and Fulton Avenue which he saw
while on an errand for light bulbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It borders on hate crime,'' said Morgan, 70. ``It's a strange,
stupid ad.''
</P>
<P>
   David Morales of North Hollywood saw the sign while washing
three loads of clothes at a Victory Boulevard Laundromat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's not too smart because you can take it a few
different ways,'' said Morales, 31. ``If they mean it to keep an
eye on your kids, it's OK. But if they want you to beat up the
coach, that's not good.''

portion of the Canyon, a feat not even his famed father attempted.
</P>
<P>
   Petit has been given the go-ahead by Navajo Nation officials to
try a 400-yard tightwire walk across the 1,600-foot-deep Lower
Colorado River Gorge on July 17.
</P>
<P>
   Why all the sudden shows of testosterone at the Canyon?
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the idea occurred to Petit before. Ten years ago, he
had a cable strung across the gorge for a walk, but he opted to try
the Eiffel Tower instead. And Evel Knievel talked years ago about
jumping the Grand Canyon but could never get National Park
officials to agree.
</P>
<P>
   This time, his son has targeted an area on the Hualapai
reservation west of Grand Canyon National Park, a jump that could
break his world record of 223 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The jump, to be broadcast nation ally on Fox, will be east to
west over an area where the Colorado River bends, said Jeff
Androsky, supervising producer for Tri-Crown Productions.
</P>
<P>
   But it gets better: He'll be traveling at least 100 mph and will
have to maneuver his machine around cactuses before his leap into
the canyon, which is between 1,200 and 2,500 feet deep in that
area. The exact distance he will cover is uncertain, although it
will be at least 200 feet.
</P>
<P>
   And despite his mother's plead ing, Knievel, 36, won't be
wearing a parachute, in part because one foiled his father's
attempt to jump the Snake River Canyon in 1974 when it deployed
early, and also because he wouldn't have time to pull the cord
anyway at that speed, according to Androsky.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Noetzel, a photographer for Fox affiliate KSAZ-TV (Channel
10), was at a promo shoot last week, and he came away in awe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what what could possess him to do this,'' Noetzel
said. ``I think really, that he knows he can make it, but there's
just something about jumping the Can yon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had rappeled about 50 feet down and was shooting up as they
pushed some (donated) motorcycles over the the edge . . . and when
they hit the bottom, you don't want to know what happened to them.
It was intense.''
</P>
<P>
   Crews are building ramps and removing as many obstacles as they
can, Androsky said Tuesday. He said cactuses, shrubs, snakes and
other wildlife are being moved for the jump but will have to be
returned to their exact locations as part of an agreement with the
Hualapais.
</P>
<P>
   Lonnie Wilder, assistant planner for the Hualapai Tribe, said
Knievel visited in late March, and the tribe gave him the needed
permission.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that's left to do is for him to jump,'' Wilder said.
</P>
<P>
   Knievel gained notoriety in April 1989 when he jumped the
fountains at Caesars Palace, a jump that nearly killed his father,
Evel Kni evel, 21 years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Knievel's most re cent publicized jump was from one
hotel tower to another at the Jockey Club on the Las Vegas Strip.
</P>
<P>
   Androsky said if Evel Knievel had thought about asking the Huala
pai Tribe for permission to jump the Canyon, he might have made the
attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Petit has done his high-wire act between the towers of the World
Trade Center, the spires of the Notre Dame cathedral and on a cable
connected to the top of the Eiffel Tower.
</P>
<P>
   But the French thrill seeker is saving his most challenging
tight rope walk for Arizona's Grand Canyon country.
</P>
<P>
   It's 300 feet higher than any of the 70 tightrope walks he has
done all over the world, the highest of which has been New York's
World Trade Center.
</P>
<P>
   The winds also are exceedingly tricky, which had given him pause
the first time around. The high-wire act could be delayed for a
day, if the winds are high on July 17.
</P>
<P>
   Reached at an apartment in New York City, Petit refused to
comment on the specifics of his walk.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a signed contract and it will go off as scheduled,''
Petit said.
</P>
<P>
   In an article in this month's New Yorker magazine, Petit said in
a written statement that the Canyon walk is the ``greatest show of
my life, the most arduous crossing, the most fragile.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorothy Lee, spokeswoman for the Navajos' Bodaway Chapter, where
Petit hopes to complete his tightrope walk, said an agreement was
reached after intense negotia tions last month. Lee said Petit will
pay an undisclosed sum to both Bodaway and the Cameron Chapter for
use of their land.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's (Petit) been out studying the Canyon and the winds for 10
years,'' Lee said. ``It's been a lot of research. We wish him the
best.'' &QL;

JUST FOR OPENERS, VELARDE PLEASED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ Randy Velarde vowed to play the first game of the
season as if it were his last.
</P>
<P>
   But three hours before it started on a cloudy Tuesday night at
Edison Field, the Angels' second baseman sat deep in an armchair in
front of a clubhouse TV set, the periwinkle sleeves of his team
jacket wrapped tight around his broad chest. Hardly the picture of
a gung-ho warrior.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trying to stay warm,'' Velarde said.
</P>
<P>
   If one guessed that in addition to feeling the weather, the
36-year-old was experiencing a case of opening-night jitters, it
would be no insult.
</P>
<P>
   After fearing his career was over as he recovered from Tommy
John elbow surgery for most of the 1997 and '98 seasons _ wondering
if he had already played his last major-league game _ Velarde would
be entitled to more opening-night emotion than most of his
teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sincerely wish I could bottle this kind of intensity and use
it the rest of the season,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his fellow Angels starters should have felt the same
way:
</P>
<P>
   _Todd Greene, the designated hitter after missing two-thirds of
last season following shoulder surgery that threatens his
once-soaring catching career.
</P>
<P>
   _Andy Sheets, the utility infielder who arrived from San Diego
in a late-March trade and landed his first opening-night start when
shortstop Gary DiSarcina broke his left arm.
</P>
<P>
   _And Troy Glaus, the 22-year-old third baseman who played his
'98 opener at Double-AA Midland and his '97 opener at UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   But each of them wore a stony mask Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the scheme of things, it's just one of 162 (games),''
Greene said in his corner of the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just trying to take advantage of an opportunity,'' Sheets
said in front of the other big-screen TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year I was getting my professional career started. This
year I'm getting my major-league career started,'' Glaus said as he
hurried from the indoor batting cage to a pregame players' meeting.
``It's all the same.''
</P>
<P>
   It's all part of the stoic, one-foot-in-front-of-the-other
approach that defines a baseball life.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers players trotted out that preposterous cliche _ ``It's
just one of 162'' _ after their come-from-behind, 11-inning victory
over the Arizona Diamondbacks in Monday's opener. A few of them
might actually have believed it.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you have to have gone through Velarde's past two seasons
to know the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Opening day to me is nerves, frustration, anticipation,
fear... all bottled into one,'' said Velarde, who grew up in
Midland, Texas, and is one of those guys who never saw a big-league
stadium until he played in one. ``It's all those emotions racing
through you. It's truly a once-a-year excitement.''
</P>
<P>
   After spending parts of nine seasons with the New York Yankees
as a utility man, starting each season on the bench or in the
minors, Velarde made an opening-night start at second base in '96,
his first year with the Angels. He hit .285 and set career highs
for runs (82), RBI (54) and homers (14).
</P>
<P>
   But three weeks before the '97 opener, Velarde felt a stabbing
pain in his throwing elbow as he warmed up for a Cactus League
start in left field. Surgery soon followed. He made his only
appearance that season came as a pinch-runner in a September game.
</P>
<P>
   In '98, on and off the disabled list, he finally put the injury
behind him by playing 51 games at season's end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, opening day wasn't a celebration for me,'' said
Velarde, who was with the team in Anaheim. ``I couldn't tell you
the first thing about it.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a rain delay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was there?'' Velarde said.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels beat the Yankees 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played the Yankees?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to opening-night action Tuesday with a new
appreciation for baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``As ballplayers, we think we're indestructible, but we're
fooling ourselves,'' Velarde said. ``A lot of guys think, `I'll
take today off. I'm not feeling that good. I'll get 'em tomorrow.'
I always assumed there would be a next day. This (an injury)
gut-checks you.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to play every game as if it might be your last. You
never know how long your body will hold up.''
</P>
<P>
   Randy Velarde's first swing of 1999 produced the Angels' first
hit of the season, a clean single up the middle off Cleveland
Indians right-hander Jaret Wright.
</P>
<P>
   A good start. You'd have to go back to '96 to find his last one.
</P>
<P>
   ``You ask me about this (opener) next year,'' he had said before
the game, knowing it would be one to remember, ``and I'll tell you
everything about it.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration has approached Moscow to
serve as a go-between with Slobodan Milosevic in a new attempt to
find a diplomatic solution to the conflict in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore called Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov by
telephone and spoke to him for 40 minutes on Tuesday, asking
Russia's help in getting the Yugoslav leader to take steps that
would lead to a diplomatic solution, Gore's office said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's contacts with Russia were reported as the administration
continued to explore other strategies to resolve the conflict
without using allied ground forces to fight the Serbians.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials gave no explanation for the timing of
the overture, and there was no indication of what had led up to it.
Primakov had traveled to Belgrade on March 30, a week after the
NATO bombing began, but that attempt at mediation was rebuffed by
NATO.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore's office did not disclose Primakov's response on
Tuesday, an aide to the vice president said the two talked about
``how we might cooperate to urge Milosevic to take steps to end the
conflict.'' The vice president made ``the point there is a
diplomatic track and we'd prefer diplomacy to bombing,'' the aide
added.
</P>
<P>
   Using the Russians as a bridge to the Yugoslav president would
help resolve the problem the administration and NATO would have
dealing directly with Milosevic after denouncing him so fiercely
for the operation to drive ethnic Albanians out of Kosovo.
Milosevic has told officials in Europe that he is not willing to
deal directly with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Senior administration officials also said that actively
involving the Russians would help soothe relations with Moscow,
which has vehemently opposed the NATO bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said the Russians would be asked to
urge Milosevic to accept the four points that the NATO allies
outlined last weekend as a condition for ending the NATO bombing.
These are the withdrawal of Serb forces from Kosovo, the return of
the refugees, the introduction of an international security force
and self-government for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Russians obtained the agreement that would be good for
the Russians,'' said a senior administration official. ``And it
would be good for us because we don't have to meet with
Milosevic.''
</P>
<P>
   In announcing these four points in the past few days,
administration officials have talked of an ``international security
force,'' a more palatable phrase for the Russians and for
Milosevic, than the earlier references to a ``NATO-led''
peacekeeping force. But it would in fact be commanded by NATO,
administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, administration officials also said they were
considering a plan to make Kosovo an ``international
protectorate,'' instead of setting up an autonomous administration
as envisioned in the Rambouillet agreements for which NATO failed
to win Serbia's agreement.
</P>
<P>
   For now, officials are rejecting the idea of partitioning
Kosovo, with the Serbs keeping a northern portion of the province
and the remaining area being given to the ethnic Albanians. They
argued that this would reward Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   After a speech on Tuesday at the Brookings Institution here,
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said that the administration
was insisting that there be a ``permissive environment'' for the
international force.
</P>
<P>
   She reiterated that the administration had ``no plans or
intentions for ground forces in a non-permissive environment.''
</P>
<P>
   The first round of diplomatic meetings on Kosovo since the NATO
strikes began will open in Brussels on Wednesday, with meetings of
the six-nation Contact Group, including Russia, the United States
and four NATO allies.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians dropped their demand that NATO halt the bombing
before they would attend such a meeting, American officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Albright is expected to attend a meeting of the foreign
ministers of the NATO allies in Brussels next Monday. If the
Contact Group meeting in Brussels goes well, it is possible that a
meeting of the group's foreign ministers will convene as well next
week. But for that to happen, a Western diplomat said, the Russians
would have to agree to the four principles laid down by NATO.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   How to deal with Milosevic has become a sore point for the
Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of Congress have said that Milosevic should be
declared a war criminal and be dealt with only as such.
</P>
<P>
   At the middle levels of the administration, especially among
those who worked on Balkan issues during the war in Bosnia, there
is also strong opposition to negotiating with Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Although officials have painted Milosevic as the perpetrator of
the forced expulsions, they have not gone so far as to accuse his
forces of committing acts of genocide.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department spokesman, James P. Rubin, has stopped just
short of using the word ``genocide,'' saying instead that there
were ``indicators of genocide'' by Milosevic's forces in Kosovo.
Pressed last weekend on whether Milosevic was a war criminal,
Albright said that was a definition that had to be determined after
a trial at the War Crimes tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   At the State Department, one official said that the
administration had not ruled out dealing with Milosevic in person.
``We dealt with Stalin for years and years,'' the official said.
``We deal with the North Koreans.''

MISSOURI VOTERS REJECT CONCEALED-FIREARMS PROPOSITION 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Missouri voters turned out in record numbers Tuesday and
rejected Proposition B, the nation's first statewide test of public
support for concealed handguns. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A huge anti-gun vote in St. Louis County offset strong support
in rural areas for the measure, which would have legalized
concealed firearms in Missouri for the first time since 1875. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Groups supporting the measure conceded the battle late Tuesday,
after having led briefly in early returns. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you fight against the governor, the first lady, the
Justice Department and the barrels of ink of the St. Louis
Post-Dispatch and The Kansas City Star?'' said Fred Myers, campaign
manager for Missourians Against Crime, which spearheaded the
pro-gun campaign. ``To say I'm disappointed is an understatement.''
</P>
<P>
   The measure lost by a ratio of 2-1 in St. Louis County. But the
race was closer than expected in Jackson County, where the
proposition lost by fewer than 4,000 votes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Support was strong in southwest Missouri and overwhelming in the
southeast part of the state, where advocates had counted on a
strong endorsement of gun rights. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With 97 percent of the vote counted, Proposition B was losing by
about 50,000 votes, or 52 percent to 48 percent. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; votetab1:The vote with 97% of precincts reporting:
 &LR; votetab2:Yes 605,749 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No 653,732 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After an often-bitter campaign, the vote was as close as
expected. The biggest surprise was in the northwestern counties,
where the proposition was losing by a small margin. Overall, state
voter turnout reached about 36 percent, translating into the
highest number of voters ever for an April election. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   State Auditor Claire McCaskill, an outspoken opponent of
concealed weapons, was elated by the outcome. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Money can't overcome common sense,'' she said. ``Voters,
particularly in urban areas, understand guns are not the answer for
safety.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Myers said he had been encouraged by early returns because so
many came from St. Louis County. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We know the out-state vote is where our people are,'' Myers
said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Wayne Crump, a Potosi Democrat who sponsored the
concealed-firearms bill last year, said he was disappointed that
the proposition was routed so badly in St. Louis County. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think in the near future it will be resubmitted to
voters,'' Crump said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas City, the proposal lost 52 percent to 48 percent. In
Platte County, 56 percent opposed the measure. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In southeast Missouri, the proposition was receiving support
from 68 percent of voters. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The National Rifle Association set the tone for the campaign,
spending $3.75 million in support of Proposition B through Sunday.
That represented a bit more than an entire year's membership dues
from the group's 103,000 Missouri members. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Opponents, who had hoped to raise $2 million, reported raising
$828,359. The difference in spending was evident in the frequency
of the television ads, the slickness of the brochures and the
variety of ways the campaigns reached out to voters.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The effort by Missourians Against Crime, which spearheaded the
Yes-on-B campaign, had all the features of a modern campaign: phone
banks, polling, direct mail, and workers blanketing public
gatherings with literature.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Safe Schools, which led the No-on-B effort, spent most of its
money in the final weeks on a widespread television ad campaign. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the group could not match supporters' presence in other
venues. So it relied on local officials and opponents in education,
health care, religion and the black community to reach out to the
public.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Missourians Against Crime also benefited from an impassioned
core of supporters who saw concealed weapons as a constitutional
right. Safe Schools never generated that kind of fervor. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Proposition B would have allowed people to obtain a permit to
carry a concealed firearm if they were at least 21 and had never
been convicted of a felony. They could not have had a misdemeanor
conviction involving a gun or a bomb. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They could not have been a known drunk, must never have been
committed to a mental institution, and must not have made threats
or been violent for the previous five years. They also would have
been required to complete 12 hours of training. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The issue divided many traditional allies. Many police officers,
especially in rural areas, supported the measure. Most law
enforcement supervisors and many street cops in urban areas opposed
it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The campaign was marked by distortions and exaggerations on both
sides. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Opponents criticized the proposal because it would have forced
sheriffs to issue gun permits to people with convictions on
relatively serious misdemeanor charges such as receiving stolen
property. They argued that people guilty of stalking and assault
could have gotten weapons as long as the incidents had occurred
more than five years before. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Opponents also warned that firearms would have been allowed near
schools, at sporting events and at shopping centers. And more guns
on the street, they argued, would lead to accidental shootings and
vigilante actions and would cause minor incidents to escalate into
gunplay. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Supporters argued that criminals already have guns; it's
law-abiding people whom the prohibition hurts. Most supporters said
concealed weapons deter crime because criminals never know who
might shoot back. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many supporters said they doubted that guns deter crime. But
they said the issue came down to a question of choice, and the
advertising campaign reflected that: Even if you don't want to
carry a gun, the ads said, don't take that right away from me. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``You may think that a concealed weapon won't deter an
attacker,'' said Steve McGhee, president of Missourians for
Personal Safety, a grass-roots group that supported Proposition B.
``But it certainly will make a difference in whether you can fight
back.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gun proponents scoffed at opponents' concerns. They said
criminals would not be willing to be fingerprinted and go through
12 hours of firearms training to get a permit. And they responded
to the argument about accidents and frequent gunplay by pointing to
30 states that have reported few problems after adopting
concealed-carry laws. &QL;

 Telephoned threat leads police to murder suspect  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRISTINE VENDEL AND JOE STEPHENS  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As police closed in Tuesday on the leading suspect in the
murders of five men, Jim Maupin answered a phone belonging to one
victim's brother. The voice growling over the line was the very man
at the center of the manhunt: 56-year-old limousine driver Gary
Beach. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell that (expletive) nephew of mine he is next,'' Beach
reportedly said, referring to the victim's brother, Dennis Gulley.
``Tell him I am going to get him.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Maupin, a friend of Gulley's, was shaken. But the next phone
call was even more chilling. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gulley's mother was on the line, frantic. She said Beach had
just called her, claiming he was in his car at that very moment,
stalking her son. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, however, police acted on a tip forwarded by
Maupin and descended on the suspect at a Westport-area hotel.
Police arrested Beach on charges of first-degree murder and armed
criminal action in the death of one of the five men. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors may file more charges in the other deaths in what
has become Kansas City's biggest murder case in a decade. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Police officers found the decomposing bodies of all five victims
in a midtown home Monday, and the home's renter, Beach, became the
chief suspect. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The charges stemmed from the death of Kenneth Gulley, who was
shot in the face. Beach was being held in jail Tuesday night
without bond and will be arraigned on those charges this morning. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jackson County Prosecutor Robert Beaird said there are no other
suspects in the four other homicides. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Beach knew all of the victims, authorities said. They are: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   -- Gulley, 45 of Independence. He was the stepson of Beach's
brother. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   -- Mark Nelson, 28. He lived with Beach. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   -- Michael L. Davis, 32. He was Beach's stepson, lived with
Beach and drove a limousine for a living. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   -- Christopher Conrad, 27, of Overland Park. He knew Beach
through Nelson. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Officials were awaiting fingerprint analysis before identifying
the fifth victim. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Authorities declined to divulge a motive for the killings. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   However, a man claiming to be Beach called /{The Kansas City
Star/} at 9:18 a.m. Tuesday and left a voice-mail message for a
reporter, talking about some of the victims. Two persons, a
relative and a longtime neighbor of Beach, identified the voice on
the message as Beach's. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is what the caller said in reference to a Tuesday story
about the killings: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you're on the wrong track. You kept emphasizing about
men, men, men. It was all a crazy crack situation, where crack
suppliers wouldn't leave certain people alone, and I finally got
fed up with it. And two of the boys there, Mark Nelson and Mike
Davis, I just didn't want them to live with the shame on their
conscience of what they were.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A man claiming to be Beach also called the Kansas City Police
homicide unit and the TIPS Hotline, authorities said. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR; brk:The arrest &QL; 
 &LR; tx:Police said they had reason to hone in on Beach as a suspect
after Gulley's relatives broke into to Beach's home at 4275
Jefferson St. and found a body. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gulley was last seen March 31, with Beach. Over the weekend,
Beach told others that they had gone to a bar on the Country Club
Plaza and several bars in North Kansas City. Beach told his
relatives Gulley left a North Kansas City bar with a woman. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Police also connected Beach to Gulley's death through a
handwritten note in Beach's home listing the five victims' names
and the location of their bodies inside the home. An expert
determined handwriting on the note matched Beach's message and
signature on a greeting card, prosecutors said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The next break in the case came Tuesday morning when Beach's
series of telephone calls alerted police to his whereabouts.
Fugitive apprehension detectives directed all available patrol cars
to saturate the midtown area, especially hotels. Police believed
Beach was staying at a hotel since he moved out of his house over
the weekend. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A rookie and his field training officer who were first at
Beach's house after the relatives discovered the bodies Monday were
the officers who found Beach on Tuesday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Officer Marty Lyons said he and Paul Myers, who graduated from
the academy three weeks ago, decided to check the parking lot of
Embassy Suites, 220 W. 43rd St., a few blocks from Beach's house. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As they drove into the parking lot, a Lincoln Town Car pulled
out of the underground parking garage in front of them, Lyons said.
The car drove behind the hotel and the driver glanced in his
rearview mirror, police said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``When he saw we were behind him, he pulled up behind a
Dumpster, stopped his car and got out,'' Lyons said. ``He said,
`You got me. You got me. No resistance. I have a gun in the front
seat and it's unloaded.' '' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lyons pointed his handgun at Beach while Myers handcuffed him.
It was 9:47 a.m. Two homicide detectives took Beach to police
headquarters, where they questioned him. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Police declined to say what Beach said during the interview. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yellow crime scene tape was taken down around the Beach's home
about 3 p.m. Tuesday. Police said they had collected about 300 bags
of evidence, including two interior doors that were splattered with
blood. Police also found 9mm shell casings and other small-caliber
shell casings. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said the killings were horrifying. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't seen this many people killed in one place since a
1989 arson fire that killed six people,'' said Capt. Jerry
Gallagher. ``It doesn't get much worse than this.'' &QL; 
 &LR; brk:`A midlife crisis' &QL; 
 &LR; tx:To Beach's longtime friends, the events of the weekend don't
fit his profile. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They depict him as the hard-working driver of an airport
limousine, a large, gentle man who wore pressed black suits and
loved to trade jokes with other chauffeurs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Friends said he was unusually close to Davis, his stepson from a
marriage that failed more than 20 years ago. Beach ate meals and
vacationed with Davis, who was among the victims found at Beach's
home. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``They were gentlemen,'' August Dubbert said of Beach and
Davis. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For more than a decade, Dubbert had rented Beach the white
single-story house. Months passed without Beach bothering to call
his landlord. He paid his $400 a month rent in cash. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Waitresses and managers at Nichols Lunch, a 24-hour restaurant
just a few blocks from his house, knew Beach well. He ate there
almost every day, often for more than one meal. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago, Beach accidentally backed his Town Car over a
cat, according to limousine driver Carol Fitzpatrick, who had known
Beach for years. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Gary cried and cried and cried,'' Fitzpatrick said. ``He took
the cat to the vet himself.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Floyd Underwood, who inspects limousine services for Kansas
City, remembered Beach's humor. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``He was always a nice person, a friendly sort of fellow,''
Underwood said. ``He was a jolly kind of guy.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Beach was a familiar face to many veteran drivers at Kansas City
International Airport. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   John Stark often traded work with Beach, filling in when Beach
or Davis couldn't make an appointment. Stark said Beach worked at
the airport for 20 years while Davis had worked there at least 10. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a complete surprise to everybody,'' Stark said. ``Among
their peers out here they had a really good reputation.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But early this year, many friends said, Beach underwent a sudden
change in demeanor and lifestyle. Beach fell behind on his rent and
into debt with some of his fellow limousine drivers. He began to
stay out late and took on new friends. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He reportedly complained that his friends and in-laws depended
on him to bail them out of trouble and pay their bills. And he told
Fitzpatrick he recently realized he would not be able to retire at
age 56, as he had planned. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I accused him of going through a midlife crisis,'' Fitzpatrick
said. ``He hadn't worked much since January. He just went
downhill.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Friends said they were surprised to learn from a reporter that
Beach had a criminal record. On an application for a taxi permit,
Beach listed four criminal convictions, all dating to the late
1970s. He listed both felony and misdemeanor convictions for what
he described as ``returned check charges.'' He also listed a 1976
misdemeanor conviction for ``solicitation &AMP; immoral'' conduct. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His taxi-permit photo shows him with a receding hairline above a
chubby, smiling face. He wore a white shirt and dark tie. The
document lists him as 5 feet, 11 inches tall, 190 pounds with brown
hair and blue eyes. He listed his birthplace as West Plains, Mo. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Asked to itemize his recent traffic convictions, he used large
capital letters to scrawl: ``NONE!'' &QL; 
 &LR; brk:`Hard to fathom' &QL; 
 &LR; tx:By Friday evening, police believe Kenneth Gulley had been shot
to death in Beach's home. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Beach unexpectedly visited the Pleasant Hill home
of his brother _ who is also Gulley's stepfather, according to
police reports and friends. Beach's brother is married to Gulley's
mother. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Beach attended church that evening with the victim's mother and
brother, Dennis. Beach also ate Easter dinner with the family the
next day, Maupin said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``They said you wouldn't have known anything was wrong,'' Maupin
said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Maupin said, Dennis Gulley drove to Beach's house and
used a cinder block to bash in the back door. He found a body
inside. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Gulley, who also operates a limousine service, planned to
spend Tuesday making funeral arrangements. He gave his car phone to
Maupin, and asked him to pick up any clients who telephoned. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Three times on Monday morning, Maupin said, the phone rang but
the caller hung up when he heard Maupin's voice. Maupin's intuition
told him the caller was the murder suspect. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Maupin prayed for God to tell him what to say. On the fourth
call, Maupin blurted out: ``Gary?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The voice, he said, grunted affirmation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Where are you?'' Maupin asked quickly, before the caller could
think. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The Plaza.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The caller, Maupin said, then issued his warning: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell that (expletive) nephew of mine (Dennis Gulley), he is
next. I was down there all weekend at his church. I aimed to get
them this weekend. Tell him, I'm going to get him.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Maupin called Gulley to warn him, and passed along the tip on
the caller's location. Gulley believed he was threatened because he
discovered the bodies. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A short time later, Gulley's mother called to report she had
spoken to Beach, too. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to fathom this whole thing and put it together,''
Maupin said. &QL;

CHARLES KEATING PLEADS GUILTY AS PART OF PLEA DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY KAMMER   
 and MARTIN DOLAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Charles H Keating Jr., a central figure in the
savings and loan scandal of the late 1980s, has ended nearly a
decade of battles with federal prosecutors by admitting to
financial crimes.
</P>
<P>
   But with a plea agreement approved Tuesday in U.S. District
Court, Keating avoided a retrial and the possibility of more prison
time. And he admitted none of the charges of concocting phony land
deals and bilking elderly investors, charges that provoked national
outrage against Keating and politicians who supported him.
</P>
<P>
   Keating, who bragged of buying influence and was fond of calling
prosecutors and bank regulators ``scum,'' pleaded guilty Tuesday
afternoon to four federal counts of fraud for siphoning $975,000
from American Continental Corp. just days before the company
declared bankruptcy in April 1989.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Mariana R. Pfaelzer accepted Keating's plea
agreement and sentenced him to the 50 months he served after he and
his son, Charles H Keating III, were convicted of fraud in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   She also waived imposing restitution against Keating and
dismissed all charges against his son, 43, who was an officer in
Phoenix-based American Continental and its California-based thrift,
Lincoln Savings and Loan.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Keating, 75, could have gotten 20 years in prison and
a $1 million fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``For more than 10 years, Charles Keating has fought us, denied
any guilt and refused to accept responsibility for his illegal
conduct,'' said Alejandro N. Mayorkas, U.S. attorney for
California's Central District.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, that fight is over. Through the extraordinary diligence
of law enforcement agents and prosecutors, Charles Keating has been
forced to admit his fraud and deceit.''
</P>
<P>
   Keating, who has claimed he was being pilloried by a ``vicious
and vindictive group of bureaucrats and sinister politicians hoping
to cover their perfidy and ignorance,'' was matter-of-fact when
Pfaelzer asked him whether he had done the things he pleaded guilty
to.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, your honor,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the plea deal, Keating submitted a sworn financial
statement to the judge. Pfaelzer, in consideration of a $3 billion
civil judgment Keating faces, ratified a stipulation in the
agreement that says Keating has no ability to pay restitution in
the criminal case.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the court, Keating _ suntanned and craggy in a pale blue
suit _ stood mute as his attorney, Steven Neal, spoke to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want him to talk until everything is finally resolved,
until all these matters are behind him,'' Neal said, referring to a
fraud case that's pending in California state court.
</P>
<P>
   Neal emphasized that the counts to which Keating pleaded guilty
had nothing to do with the core of the government's case _ that he
and American Continental officials conducted sham land deals that
allowed him to create an illusion of prosperity as he drove Lincoln
into the ground, and that he kept peddling American Continental
junk bonds to unsuspecting buyers with bogus assurances that the
company was thriving.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, there was a risk involved'' in going to trial,
particularly a lengthy trial, Neal said. ``You weigh all that
against the offer that was made to us and it was irresistible.''
</P>
<P>
   Neal said Keating's financial statement shows a ``negative net
worth,'' and an exhaustive search for hidden overseas assets turned
up nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Neal also took a jab at bank regulators, saying that if Keating
and his companies had been left alone, ``the investors would have
done very well.'' The assets of Lincoln, seized when the government
took over the thrift in 1989, have performed ``spectacularly'' over
the past decade, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Sharon McCaslin, who was not the trial prosecutor,
said the deal was cut ``in the interests of justice.'' She noted
the difficulty of pressing a complex case that's 10 years old.
</P>
<P>
   But the bottom line, prosecutors say, is that Keating has
finally admitted he broke the law.
</P>
<P>
   In Phoenix, Karen Keating, wife of Charles Keating III, said her
husband was a good man ``who did not deserve the last 12 years of
suspicion and scandal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I love him, his kids love him and we are glad this is finally
behind him,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Several of those who lost money in the collapse of American
Continental and Lincoln were thankful the long fight had finally
ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of ironic, because we're getting our last little bit
of money out of the lawsuit,'' said Don Maxfield, who lost $21,000
invested in American Continental.
</P>
<P>
   Don and Judy Maxfield, who lived in Lakewood, Calif., when they
invested in 1979, sued along with thousands of other bondholders.
They have recovered about 65 percent of the money they lost, not
including interest.
</P>
<P>
   The Maxfields considered themselves lucky because, unlike many
elderly bondholders, they were young enough to recover from the
collapse.
</P>
<P>
   James Catena, a retired Army veteran in Hemet, Calif., said time
has healed the wounds he suffered at Keating's hands. He's ready to
let bygones be bygones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 84 years old, and I don't have that much time left,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Catena almost had a nervous breakdown when he lost $100,000
he'd invested in American Continental.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I'm a little forgiving,'' he said. ``I just wonder if
he's had enough. I have mixed feelings about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Catena has recouped about 80 percent of his investment through
lawsuits and special funds set aside by the courts over the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not much more to get from him,'' Catena said.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix attorney Michael Manning was less forgiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't dodge a bullet, he dodged a howitzer,'' said
Manning, who worked for the federal agency in charge of handling
Lincoln's losses.
</P>
<P>
   Manning described Keating as a man who left ``a
multibillion-dollar black hole for the taxpayers to fill up.''
Lincoln's losses were set at $3.4 billion, the costliest failure in
the national S&AMP;L debacle.
</P>
<P>
   But the human suffering Keating inflicted on his victims was
even harsher, the lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were careers ruined, people lost their law licenses,
lost their accounting licenses, there were suicides . . . a number
of broken marriages,'' Manning recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much has been written about the financial wake of this man's
greed and larceny, but there's much more that's wrong about Charles
Keating than just the financial loss. And it's too bad that he
won't spend more of his life starting the repayment of that debt.''
</P>
<P>
   In January 1993, a federal jury convicted Keating of 73 counts
of wire and bankruptcy fraud in the collapse of American
Continental and Lincoln. His son was convicted on 64 counts.
</P>
<P>
   Pfaelzer called the evidence against the elder Keating
overwhelming and sentenced him to 12 years and 7 months in prison.
</P>
<P>
   But the conviction was reversed after it was discovered that
jurors knew of Keating's previous conviction in a California state
court and had discussed it during his federal trial. The state
conviction, on charges that Keating had swindled bond investors in
American Continental, was itself thrown out because of a flawed
instruction to the jury by the judge. An appeal by prosecutors, who
want the conviction restored, is pending.
</P>
<P>
   Neal jokingly turned aside a question from a reporter who wanted
to know how he was being paid.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one question I should let you ask Mr. Keating, but not
today,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   With that, Neal, Keating and several Keating family members
climbed into a chauffeured Lincoln Town Car and drove off. &QL;

OFFSHORE INTERNET SPORTS BOOK IS NOW TAKING BETS ON THE DOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK ALM  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the stock market isn't crazy enough already, an offshore
Internet sports book is now taking bets on the daily ups and downs
of the Dow Jones industrial average. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Professional tennis matches and national election returns might
be next. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Inversiones Ibarburu, based in Costa Rica, began accepting bets
on the Dow's close in late March on its Web site at
www.bestbetsports.com. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The company tested the wagering waters a few weeks earlier when
it accepted bets on who would win the Oscars, customer service
manager Tony Price said in a telephone interview. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We got pretty good play on the Academy Awards,'' Price said.
``We're looking at areas to expand to give people what they
want.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There's one potential problem. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's illegal,'' said John Russell, a spokesman for the U.S.
Justice Department in Washington. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not so, according to Internet operators who contend that their
offshore casino and sports book sites operate legally in those
countries and thus are beyond the reach of federal and state laws. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And the cyberbookies may be right, at least for the time being. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors acknowledge that they have been stymied for
years in enforcing a federal anti-gambling law that predates the
Internet. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Justice Department hasn't tested its jurisdiction
over gambling in cyberspace, and only a handful of states,
including Missouri, have attempted prosecutions under state law. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of our players are Americans,'' Price acknowledged.
``What we do is perfectly legal in Costa Rica.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Congress is considering a bill that would outlaw any Internet
gambling that is not regulated in the United States. An earlier
version of the measure failed to advance last year, in part because
of a disputed provision that also criminalized the actions of
at-home gamblers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sue Schneider of St. Charles, Mo., who is chairwoman of the
Canadian-based Interactive Gaming Council, said there were now more
than 300 gambling sites on the Internet, with more being added
every month. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It can't be stopped,'' Schneider said of cybergambling in an
article last week in her online magazine at {www.igamingnews.com}. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although experts' estimates vary widely, all would agree that,
left unchecked, online gambling revenue will soon be measured in
billions of dollars, if they aren't already. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers have Wall Street watching very closely. But
because of the legal uncertainties, investors so far are not
enamored with the many publicly traded Internet gambling firms. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``They're very flaky,'' Bear Stearns &AMP; Co. analyst Jason Ader
said recently. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In his recent newsletter, Prudential Securities analyst Joseph
V. Coccomiglio doesn't forecast a bonanza, even under the best of
legal scenarios. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Online casinos cannot compete with real casinos,'' he
declared. But given a legal fighting chance, he said, online
gambling would certainly carve a lucrative niche for itself. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Coccomiglio and others note that some leading U.S. casino firms
and others have begun to cautiously position themselves in
cyberspace. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most casinos already are online with customer service and
information Web sites. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last month Playboy Enterprises Inc. announced it was developing
a casino site at {www.playboy.com} called Play 4 Fun that would
offer slot machines, video poker and other games without the risk
of losing money. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last year several states in Australia became the first in any
large country to legalize and license Internet gambling. Canada
considered national legislation last year, and Hong Kong is
exploring ways to sanction and regulate Internet gambling. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While several U.S. states are considering laws to outlaw the
activity, the Nevada Legislature two years ago embraced intrastate
Internet gambling. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Legal or not, Schneider said, there will be no consumer
breakthrough for the industry until at-home players trust that the
games they play are honest. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been a handful of sites where there have been
problems,'' Schneider said. ``But those sites are pretty much
known. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Players communicate with each other. New players need to do
their homework.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Schneider's council later this month will begin
issuing what it calls seals of compliance to gambling Web site
applicants that pledge to adhere to the council's code of conduct
and dispute-resolution process. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a Better Business Bureau,'' she said of the group's
current list of 55 Internet industry members. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Costa Rica, the Dow wagering proposition is similar to the
standard ``over-under'' bet on total points scored in an athletic
contest. Market watchers bet whether the Dow will close higher or
lower on the day after they place their wager. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Up or down, the odds are locked at -110, which means a bettor
must risk $110 to win $100. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Like most gambling Web sites, financial transactions occur
through players' credit cards or bank wire transfers, Price said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 a Greene County, Mo., grand jury returned a one-count
indictment against offshore-based Interactive Gaming &AMP;
Communications Corp. for operating an unlicensed Internet gambling
operation accessible to Missourians. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The case ended last fall in the nation's first prosecution of an
Internet bookie. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a plea bargain, Missouri Attorney General Jay Nixon accepted
misdemeanor guilty pleas of promoting gambling from the Web site's
publicly traded corporate parent, based in Pennsylvania, and its
chief executive. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The defendants, who reported handling more than $30 million in
bets during 1997 and part of 1998, paid fines totaling $7,500. &QL;

JAZZ FRUSTRATES LAKERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ Scramble the roster, add a 3-point-shooting ace, a
dominant rebounder and, hey, toss in a rookie point guard for good
measure. They tried it all, but no number of additions and
subtractions could help the Lakers solve the puzzle that caused
them to fail last May's final exam.
</P>
<P>
   Same Utah Jazz, same result Tuesday night at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   Even with Glen Rice, Dennis Rodman and recently activated rookie
Tyronn Lue sharing the floor for the new-look Lakers, the old-look
Jazz stuck it to them again in a 106-93 victory before a charged
but disappointed sellout crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the Lakers had beaten the Jazz at the Delta Center
just last month, just before they traded Eddie Jones and Elden
Campbell to Charlotte for Rice and J.R. Reid. So much for upgrades.
</P>
<P>
   Despite hanging with the Jazz and leading by four points early
in the fourth quarter, the Lakers collapsed down the stretch and
had fallen to a double-digit deficit by the 3:45 mark, with Shandon
Anderson and Karl Malone doing the damage.
</P>
<P>
   When he wasn't wrestling Rodman, Malone was hitting all 12 of
his field goals for a game-high 30 points. Anderson added 12 off
the bench _ all in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal led the Lakers with 24 points and Rick Fox came
off the bench for 19. But the Lakers shot a dismal 41 percent,
including a 3-for-10 night from Rice and a 6-for-14 performance
from Kobe Bryant. The only bright spot was Lue, scoring 12 points
and handing out six assists in 23 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Win or lose, coach Kurt Rambis had said he wouldn't ascribe any
special significance to the game on the sole basis of the opponent.
A barometer game? Not to Rambis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never done that. I just can't ever see the logic of that,
even when I was a ballplayer,'' he said before tipoff. ``You try to
get up for every ballgame. I just don't know how this game,
record-wise, is any more important than any other ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, all games are of increased importance now, with the
Lakers fighting for home-court advantage in the playoffs and still
within striking distance of the Portland Trail Blazers for the
Pacific Division lead.
</P>
<P>
   Starting with tonight's game at Sacramento, the Lakers have 14
games left to make a run, and four of those contests are against
the Trail Blazers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Realistically, when you look at it, if we win by 30 or lose by
30 (to Utah), I don't know what that means,'' Rambis said. ``It
still comes down to, are we playing our best basketball at the end
of the year and how well we do in the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   The third meeting of the season between the Jazz and Lakers had
a little of everything _ the usual rough play, a heap of personal
fouls, a few technical fouls, a tossed coach and a potential
breakthrough performance by a Lakers rookie.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman earned his team-leading 11th technical of the season
during the first quarter, when he yanked Malone to the floor by his
jersey. Utah coach Jerry Sloan outdid Rodman, getting a pair of
technicals, earning an automatic ejection with 10:52 left in the
third. O'Neal got the fourth technical of the night for yapping in
the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But the first half was nothing if not a coming-out party for
Lakers point guard Tyronn Lue. The rookie out of Nebraska got his
first significant minutes of the season when he entered early in
the second quarter for the injured Derek Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   And Lue wasted no time displaying the skills that made him one
of the top point guards in the 1998 draft and a favorite of Lakers
management. The Lakers were down by seven points when Lue entered
the game, and he quickly led them on a 12-5 run to tie the game for
the first time all night, at 34-all.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the half, with Lue aggressively pushing the ball
upcourt and dishing out three assists to go with four points, the
Lakers had taken a 51-50 lead. And Lue had played more minutes than
starter Derek Harper.
</P>
<P>
   And Forum had itself a new fan favorite, dousing the rookie with
hearty calls of ``Loooooo.''

 MEXICAN OFFICIALS ISSUE ARREST WARRANT FOR GOVERNOR IN
HIDING  (sw) 
 By SAM DILLON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Mexican authorities on Tuesday issued an arrest
warrant for the maverick governor of a Caribbean state that became
a cocaine smuggling center during his six-year tenure, which ended
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general, Jorge Madrazo Cuellar, said he had been
unable until now to seek the politician's arrest because as
governor he had enjoyed constitutional immunity from criminal
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   But the ex-governor, Mario Villanueva Madrid, who abandoned his
duties last month and fled into hiding after he became the target
of a federal drug and racketeering investigation, said in a letter
from underground faxed to Mexican newspapers that the accusations
against him have been invented as part of a political vendetta.
Villanueva said that he would continue to elude arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Villanueva was the governor of the state of Quintana Roo in the
Yucatan peninsula. The warrant issued on Tuesday for his arrest
caps a lengthy investigation by Mexican and U.S. authorities that
is one of the most ambitious attempts to prosecute any senior
Mexican politician on drug charges.
</P>
<P>
   In a lengthy statement issued on Tuesday night, the attorney
general denied that the investigation was politically motivated,
and requested international help in locating Villanueva.
</P>
<P>
   In the letter Villanueva faxed to newspapers late on Monday, he
offered for the first time his own explanation for his
extraordinary decision to go into hiding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hounded by an investigation designed to incriminate me at all
costs, I had to take an extremely difficult personal decision:
abandon my native soil to avoid imprisonment,'' Villanueva said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a criminal,'' he said. ``They're persecuting me for
strictly political reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not explain his whereabouts, which remain a mystery. On
March 26, Villanueva disappeared, leaving his state Government in
chaos after delivering a final speech to supporters in Chetumal,
the Quintana Roo capital at the south end of the Yucatan peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   The letter confirmed what until recent days had seemed almost
unthinkable: that one of Mexico's 31 state governors and a leader
of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI, has
fled into hiding to avoid arrest and begun to publicly attack the
Mexican justice system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't wait ingenuously for an injustice to be orchestrated
by federal prosecutors,'' Villanueva said in his letter. ``I'll
plan my defense, but not at the risk of prison or at the expense of
my ability to act.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They accuse me of being a cocaine addict, but I'm not, and I
can prove that objectively and scientifically,'' he said. ``They
want to destroy me physically, psychologically and morally.''
</P>
<P>
   The tenure of Villanueva, 53, coincided with a surge in the
smuggling of Colombian cocaine through Quintana Roo, and Mexican
and U.S. officials have for a year been accusing the governor of
protecting traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet his complaint that his prosecution is partisan will ring
true for many here because he has quarreled publicly with powerful
PRI officials and because many Mexicans believe that other senior
PRI politicians as well as military and police officials have
profited from the drug trade without facing prosecution.

SHEFFIELD'S HOMER LIFTS DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It had to be a homer. Nothing else would do it
because neither the Dodgers nor Arizona Diamondbacks could get a
hit with a runner in scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   It took Gary Sheffield's one-out solo homer in the 10th to lift
the Dodgers to a 3-2 win over Arizona on Tuesday night at Dodger
Stadium, the Dodgers' second extra-inning win in as many days.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield's first homer of the season came on the first pitch he
saw from reliever Brian Anderson. It was a line drive to left.
</P>
<P>
   To that point, both teams struggled in clutch situations. The
Diamondbacks, who were 0 for 7 with runners in scoring position,
squandered glorious chances in the ninth and 10th innings against
Alan Mills.
</P>
<P>
   After pinch-runner Dante Powell stole second with one out,
Bernard Gilkey popped to second and Tony Batista popped to catcher
Todd Hundley. The 10th inning was a bit more harrowing, with Mills
striking out Steve Finley after Arizona's leadoff hitter fouled off
six pitches with David Dellucci on third with one out. Jay Bell
grounded to third to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if this is the kind of excitement the new regime is
bringing to Dodger Stadium, it may be a good idea to check out some
games.
</P>
<P>
   A day after Raul Mondesi homered twice in an extra-inning
come-from-behind win in the season opener, the Dodgers and
Diamondbacks nearly came to blows in what turned into a lively,
emotional sixth inning.
</P>
<P>
   With the score tied at 2, both clubs' benches and bullpens
spilled onto the field after the Diamondbacks' Matt Williams took
umbrage when Chan Ho Park's pitch sailed behind the third baseman's
head. It came one pitch after Williams, who homered earlier, came
within a few feet of another home run, though the ball hooked foul.
</P>
<P>
   There were some hairy moments. With all the players milling near
the pitcher's mound, Dodgers first baseman Eric Karros was trying
to position himself between teammates and several Diamondbacks.
Pushing ensued, but no punches were thrown.
</P>
<P>
   During the near-altercation, Williams remained near home plate
while Park stayed on the pitcher's mound.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the game, Park hit Bernard Gilkey with a pitch.
Gilkey homered twice off Kevin Brown on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   However, there's no question what kind of affect the incident
had on Park. He struck out Williams on a pitch in the dirt, retired
Luis Gonzalez on a grounder to first and then fanned Bernard Gilkey
for his first 1-2-3 inning since the first.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers seemed primed to carry the emotion into the bottom
of the inning with leadoff singles from Mondesi and Devon White.
The irony seemed perfect with Karros up. But Arizona starter Todd
Stottlemyre, vociferous in his own right during the skirmish, got
Karros to ground into a double play. Mark Grudzielanek popped to
short to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the last time Karros or Grudzielanek had an
opportunity to put the Dodgers ahead. Gary Sheffield started the
eighth with a single and stole second. Mondesi struck out, Devon
White walked and reliever Darren Holmes, brought in to face Karros,
balked the runners over.
</P>
<P>
   Needing a fly ball to score a run, Karros popped to third and
Grudzielanek flew out.
</P>
<P>
   The innings underscored what was the bane of the Dodgers. They
went hitless in 11 at-bats with runners in scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   For the second straight day the Dodgers were victimized by the
long ball. All five of Arizona's runs came via homers the day
before, and the Diamondbacks countered an early 2-0 Dodgers lead in
the same fashion again.
</P>
<P>
   Finley made it 2-1 when he turned on Park's 1-1 pitch and
homered to right field. An inning later, Park became a piece of
history for Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who's hit at least 20 homers in each of the last nine
seasons, crushed Park's first pitch of the fourth inning deep to
center field for his first homer of the season. Not only did it tie
the game 2-2, but it was Williams' 300th career homer.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of Williams' homer total, and career, is
Dodgers third baseman Adrian Beltre, who turns 21 today, the
youngest member of a veteran club.
</P>
<P>
   Beltre had a spectacular spring, on the heels of a sensational
winter in which he was named the Most Valuable Player of the
Dominican Winter League.
</P>
<P>
   Despite lingering questions about his offense, Beltre quieted
the critics in his first at-bat against the Diamondbacks. He lined
a two-out, two-run homer to left off Stottlemyre to give the
Dodgers a 2-0 lead in the second inning.

VAUGHN HURT AS ANGELS WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ If it were a movie script, one would think it was
written by Stephen King, not the Walt Disney Co. After all, nowhere
in a Disney movie does the star attraction get hurt so soon after
the curtain opens.
</P>
<P>
   But that's what happened to first baseman Mo Vaughn only minutes
into his first game as an Angel. Vaughn, who signed a six-year, $80
million contract last November, roamed to the visitors' dugout on
the first base side in an attempt to catch a pop foul hit by the
Cleveland Indians' Omar Vizquel, the second batter of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn reached the edge of the top dugout step, then went one
step too far, falling into the dugout and spraining his left ankle.
He remained in the game and played five innings of the Angels' 6-5
victory, going 0 for 2.
</P>
<P>
   In typical Disney fashion, the game had a happy ending for the
home team. Troy Glaus' two-out double scored Garret Anderson from
first base in the eighth to give the Angels the 6-5 lead. And Troy
Percival, after strong performances by fellow relievers Mark
Petkovsek and Mike Holtz, closed it out with a 1-2-3 ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, who was due to lead off the bottom of the sixth, was
replaced by Jeff Huson to start the top of the sixth so Vaughn
could go for precautionary X-rays, which were negative.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn limped noticeably while he was in the game, and fell at
the plate after hitting a fly ball to left field in his first
at-bat. But Angels medical director Dr. Lewis Yocum said after
Vaughn was taped up ``he felt comfortable enough to continue.
</P>
<P>
   At least for a little while.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, another Angels' free agent acquisition struggled in
his debut. Tim Belcher, who signed a two-year, $10.2 million
contract, lasted just 41/3 innings, giving up five runs and six
hits while making 92 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Back-to-back homers by Tim Salmon and Garret Anderson in the
fourth off Indians' starter Jaret Wright gave Belcher and the
Angels a 3-2 lead, but Belcher surrendered the lead in the fifth
when the Indians scored three runs on four hits.
</P>
<P>
   With Petkovsek providing three scoreless innings of middle
relief, the Angels rallied from their 5-3 deficit with two runs in
the seventh. Shortstop Andy Sheets drove in the first run with his
second hit of the night, and Darin Erstad's sacrifice fly scored
Matt Walbeck (2 for 4) to tie the game.
</P>
<P>
   Belcher was a little wild early, walking two in the first inning
and one in the second. But he didn't allow a hit until third inning
when Kenny Lofton led off with a triple and scored on Vizquel's
two-run homer. Vizquel, who had only two homers all of last season,
has just 30 career homers in 1,321 games.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels got on the scoreboard against Wright in the bottom of
the third after Walbeck singled, went to third on Sheets' single
and scored on Erstad's groundout.

CLIPPERS LOSE TO SUNS
</HEADLINE>

 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For a more humane approach to this season of
water-drip torture, the Clippers have decided to abandon pretenses
and drown the prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   In front Tuesday's captive audience of 6,450 at the Sports
Arena, the not-so-good guys began their NBA Draft lottery stretch
drive in an 88-83 loss to the ripe Phoenix Suns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their little gimmick defense,'' said Clipper coach Chris Ford
of a half-court trap trotted out by the Suns (16-18) in the fourth
quarter, ``got us out of what we were doing.''
</P>
<P>
   What the Clippers (3-30) were doing - while low-flying pigs
orbited the venue -- was controlling the game. Before committing
multiple acts of treason, they held scoreboard for the first 38
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just broke down on offense,'' point guard Sherman Douglas
said. ``We backed down; we lost the momentum and couldn't get it
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, before the Clippers' signature fourth-quarter retreat,
this adventure started much like a Republican paradise: everything
was going right.
</P>
<P>
   One example of favorable mojo was the absence of Tom Gugliotta
(wounded knee), the Phoenix power forward who averaged 22 points
and 13 rebounds in two Suns victories over the Clippers this
season. Suns shooting guard Rex Chapman was on the injured list,
just another NBA veteran struck down by turf toe.
</P>
<P>
   Suns coach Danny Ainge did enough crabbing to attract stereo
technical fouls and watch the fourth quarter on a TV inside the
visitors' locker room.
</P>
<P>
   Another unexpected Clipper bonus was the play of dynamo Suns
point guard Jason Kidd, whose early performance - relative to his
all-star standards - was uglier than a bridesmaid dress. Through
three quarters, Kidd had seven points (on 3-of-10 shooting), four
assists and a season-high nine turnovers. But he finished with the
anticipated panache, scoring 15 points and handing out two assists
in the final quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jason got into his zone,'' Ford said. ``He just took over the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Before what smelled like the inevitable, Eric Piatkowski - who
tied a career high with 29 points -- may not have taken the Suns to
school, but he dropped them off within walking distance. The
Clipper shooting guard pulled the trigger for 14 first-half points,
and the Suns trailed, 50-40, at intermission.
</P>
<P>
   Piatkowski added seven in round three, but the Clippers' lead
was sliced to 65-62 entering round four. ``Pike'' scored eight more
before it was over, while the Phoenix trap had his teammates
inviting copyright lawsuits from relatives of the Keystone Kops.
</P>
<P>
   By then, Kidd had the Clipper defense chasing him like
overmatched babysitters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you let him get off,'' Douglas said, ``you're in
trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   And if you're in trouble, there's a good chance you also are in
the Sports Arena.

YANKEES BEAT A'S, 7-4 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ David Cone has a respectable reputation as a
prognosticator. Before last year's playoffs, he thought that Scott
Brosius would star, that he had ``a glint in his eye.'' Brosius was
named the most valuable player of the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Cone, it should be noted, recently pointed to the adjacent
locker of Orlando Hernandez and said, ``I think he's going to have
a big year,'' emphasizing the word big. Big as in exceptional.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez took his first step toward realizing Cone's
expectations on Tuesday night, limiting Oakland to three hits in
seven and one-third innings in the Yankees' 7-4 victory _ their
first of the 1999 season and the first under the interim manager
Don Zimmer. Derek Jeter hit a triple and two singles in five
at-bats. He finished strongly in spring training, batting .378
during the exhibition season, and already has six hits in eight
at-bats in the regular season, with a 1.375 slugging percentage.
</P>
<P>
   The Athletics rallied for three runs in the eighth off
Hernandez, Mike Stanton and Mariano Rivera, who got the save, to
pull within a run, 5-4. But Paul O'Neill's two-run triple in the
top of the ninth gave the Yankees a three-run cushion.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees won 125 games in 1998 and it was Hernandez who
pitched and won in the only true must-win situation, Game 4 of the
American League Championship Series, which the Yankees entered
trailing 2 games to 1. The Yankees certainly did not need to win
Tuesday night's game in the same way; this was the second game of a
162-game schedule, after all.
</P>
<P>
   But in beating the Athletics, Hernandez applied some salve to a
team growing more tense by the day: The Yankees played poorly at
the end of the exhibition season, they didn't hit and lost the
season opener Monday, and it has been four days now since the
principal owner George Steinbrenner has spoken to his interim
manager. ``But I know I'm in his thoughts,'' Zimmer noted, before
sprouting a grin.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Hernandez has supplanted Zimmer for a day in
Steinbrenner's mind, for he was brilliant on Tuesday night. Some
American League teams exploited Hernandez last year by stacking
their lineups with left-handed hitters. But Hernandez, El Duque,
has adapted to this, using a sharp curveball early in the count to
get ahead, then interchanging his fastball and changeup to finish
them off. The first seven hitters in Oakland's batting order were
either left-handed or switch-hitters, and combined to go 1 for 13
the first two times through the order.
</P>
<P>
   Before Manager Joe Torre left the Yankees, he shared thoughts
similar to those of Cone. The league cannot necessarily adjust to
Hernandez in this, his second year in the league, Torre said,
because there is nothing to adjust to, no pattern to discern.
Hernandez has such a wide-ranging variety of pitches and speeds and
throws from so many different angles _ high and low, from over the
top to down by his belt buckle _ that even after seeing him a
second or third time, they still don't know what to expect from
pitch to pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, too, is adept at giving himself a chance to win. Last
year, he had quality starts (three runs or less in six or more
innings) in 14 of his 21 starts, the highest ratio of any Yankees
starter.
</P>
<P>
   He allowed just two hits and a run in the first five innings on
Tuesday night, and by then the Yankees already had a four-run lead
after jumping early on the Oakland knuckleball pitcher Tom
Candiotti. Chuck Knoblauch slapped a single over shortstop, Jeter
hammered a line drive to the wall in right-center for a triple, and
O'Neill flied out deep enough to center for Jeter to tag up and
score. Six pitches into the game, the Yankees led, 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   They continued to beat on Candiotti in the second, using a
disciplined approach to hitting the right-hander's knuckler _
rather than take their normal step forward as they swung, some of
the Yankees waited patiently for the knuckler. Chad Curtis waited
and slammed a knuckler over the wall in left-center field.
</P>
<P>
   Chili Davis singled leading off the fourth inning and Jorge
Posada walked, and the Oakland infielders moved in, suspecting that
Brosius would bunt with two on and no out. Instead, Zimmer ordered
a double steal, with the 39-year-old Davis as the lead man, and the
ploy worked. Davis scored when Brosius flied out to left, and
Posada eventually completed his trip around the bases on a wild
pitch and Curtis's sacrifice fly. &QL;

VAUGHN FORCED TO LEAVE ANGELS DEBUT 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Whoops.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the Angels are cursed.
</P>
<P>
   Mo Vaughn's California career got off to a shaky start Tuesday
night when he sprained his left ankle chasing Omar Vizquel's
first-inning popup in the Angels' season opener.
</P>
<P>
   Many fans weren't yet in their seats (this is California, folks)
when Vizquel, the second batter of the game, hit a foul pop toward
the first base dugout. Mo, clearly unfamiliar with the terrain,
raced over and fell off the stage, dropping 4 feet down into the
Cleveland dugout. None of the Indians attempted to stop him.
</P>
<P>
   In the bottom of the first, Anaheim fans gave him a standing
ovation when he came to the plate. Vaughn fell down in the batter's
box after he lofted a routine fly to left. He was late getting back
on the field for the top of the second. Presumably, the Angel
medical staff was taping his ankles.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn flied to left again in the third. As the game wore on, it
became painful to watch him jog on and off the field between
innings. He didn't come out for the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Angels physician Lewis Yocum determined that Vaughn had sprained
the ankle, and the big first baseman was taken from the ballpark
for X-rays. The tests were negative, and Mo was on crutches in the
locker room following Anaheim's 6-5 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a high sky out there (Tuesday night),'' said Vaughn.
``I didn't really know where I was, and no one yelled anything. But
it's my job to protect myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite appearances, Vaughn isn't ready to rule himself out.
``I'll come back out to the park (Wednesday),'' he said. ``I'm a
quick healer, you never know. I'm just glad it wasn't broken.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Angels' curse? ``No curse,'' he replied. ``I've
already been through that.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a long way from Boston to Anaheim, and perhaps only the
late Stanley Kubrick could have properly chronicled the events that
led to Mo's departure from Fenway Park. He was a member of the Red
Sox organization for 10 years, bolting on the eve of last
Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in front of his locker before his Angel debut, Mo talked
about what he misses in the Hub:
</P>
<P>
   ``I miss my friends. I miss Jimy Williams and the coaches over
there. I miss the fans. I'm gonna always miss the fans and things
like that, but I think it was a situation that we knew was gonna
happen. So I'll always look back and figure that Boston put me on
the map, but I also knew I had to make this change and I'm happy
where I am.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jimy taught me to play both sides of the ball. He taught me
how to play defense. He's a great teacher and a good man. He gives
it to you straight and tells you how it is. He's a baseball person.
He was good to me. They'll make him the fall guy if things go bad
there, but I'll always remember him _ and Rico (Petrocelli) and
Wendell (Kim) and (Jim) Rice and Grady (Little). Those are my
boys.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not mention Red Sox CEO John Harrington and general
manager Dan Duquette, the Eliot and Barry of Boston sports. Vaughn
last year called them ``the joint chiefs of staff.'' (``Did I
really say that?,'' he asked Tuesday night.) It was never really
clear which man wanted Mo gone, but the Sox carried out their plan
and now Boston's centerpiece player is an Angel.
</P>
<P>
   Mo joins the ever-expanding club of ex-Sox stars who travel the
big league circuit spreading the gospel of Boston's front office
buffoonery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just got tired of all the garbage,'' Vaughn said. ``I felt
my job was to show up and play, and I did that. I played hard and I
played well. But it's hard when you don't have people that should
be behind you behind you. Now I'm in that situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boston is so tough because they haven't won and when things go
poorly, you need someone to step up and relieve the pressure. But I
have no hard feelings from where I have come from and what
happened. I was lucky that Roger (Clemens) had gone through it
before so I was kind of prepared for it. Boston was positive for me
and I enjoyed myself there, but I just knew that upstairs they
couldn't do it, and we had to make a move.''
</P>
<P>
   He claims to be happy in his new surroundings. He hit .271 in
spring training with only one homer and 14 RBIs. He said there's no
extra pressure riding shotgun with his $80 million contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't worry about it,'' he said. ``I just come out here and
play my game. If you prepare and work hard and put your time in,
it's gonna come to you. How it starts is not how it's gonna end.
When I'm out there playing, I'm not thinking about my contract.
I've always loved to just play this game. Period. And the
situations and the pressures is what you live on. You can't play in
more of a pressure situation than the one I played _ playing on a
one-year deal was the toughest thing. I just go out and play to my
capabilities and play hard. It's the thing I've always done.
</P>
<P>
   ``The adjustment has been fine. It's been a good situation, a
smooth transition. The guys in the clubhouse and the organization
are all very nice. The game hasn't changed and I have the same
intensity I always had. I'm a competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   Leroy and Shirley Vaughn have moved to this land of swimming
pools and movie stars. Mo said he'll keep his home in Easton, Mass.
He also said he'll keep sending first baseman's mitts to Mike
Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn's teammates say nice things about him. (Reliever
Shigetoshi Hasegawa says Mo has fine taste in Japanese jewelry.)
He's already made pledges to contribute to local charities. And
Mo's the go-to guy for that carnivorous California media. There
were no less than 20 reporters around his locker two hours before
the Angels took the field for their season opener.
</P>
<P>
   I took a chance and asked him the question that is on the lips
of every Sox fan I know. I asked him if he'd found any suitable
replacement for the Foxy Lady.
</P>
<P>
   ``You better cut it out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   I'll take that as a yes.

LAKERS FRUSTRATED AGAIN BY JAZZ
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ Scramble the roster, add a 3-point-shooting ace, a
dominant rebounder and, hey, toss in a rookie point guard for good
measure. They tried it all, but no number of additions and
subtractions could help the Lakers solve the equation that caused
them to fail last May's finals exam.
</P>
<P>
   Same Utah Jazz, same result Tuesday night at the Forum. Another
failing grade for the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Even with Glen Rice, Dennis Rodman and recently activated rookie
Tyronn Lue sharing the floor for the new-look Lakers, the old-look,
old-legs Jazz stuck it to them again in a 106-93 victory before a
charged but disappointed sellout crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the Lakers had beaten the Jazz at the Delta Center
just last month, three days before they traded Eddie Jones and
Elden Campbell to Charlotte for Rice and J.R. Reid in a move to
bolster their odds against the likes of the Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   So much for upgrades.
</P>
<P>
   Despite hanging with the Jazz for three quarters, the Lakers had
a familiar collapse down the stretch, as Shandon Anderson's 12
points in the final 9:47 turned a Lakers lead into another
exasperating defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman couldn't explain it. Rice refused to even comment for
fear he might say the wrong thing. Everyone else had filed quickly
out of the locker room, avoiding the questions and heading straight
for the team charter to Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   That left Shaquille O'Neal to sum up the latest in a too-long
series of disappointments.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a team like that, you gotta play defense all the time. We
only played for three quarters,'' said O'Neal, who led the Lakers
with 24 points.
</P>
<P>
   Well, they played defense. It just didn't look much like what
the coaching staff had in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't execute our game plan,'' coach Kurt Rambis said.
``They started falling asleep, coming up with their own system of
how to play defense, instead of sticking to what we had in mind.''
</P>
<P>
   So an 80-76 Lakers lead with 9:58 to go quickly vanished in a
flurry of Anderson layups. John Stockton and Karl Malone did the
rest, the latter scoring a game-high 30 points on 12-for-12
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Anderson's explosion, first against Kobe Bryant and
then Rick Fox, that hurt most. Bryant was lifted in favor of Fox
midway through the quarter, though Rambis declined to say if that
was a reflection on his play. O'Neal seemed to hint at it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The school that I grew up in, if somebody ain't doing their
job, you take them out of the game,'' O'Neal said. ``Immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We gotta stick with the team, rather than try to do stuff on
our own,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   There were offensive lapses as well, as the Lakers shot a dismal
41 percent, including a 3-for-10 night from Rice and a 6-for-14
performance from Bryant. The only bright spots were Lue, scoring 12
points and handing out six assists in 23 minutes, and a 19-point
effort off the bench from Fox.
</P>
<P>
   After backup point guard Derek Fisher left the game with knee
problems, Lue turned the first half into his personal coming-out
party. The Lakers were down by seven points when the rookie out of
Nebraska entered the game and he quickly led them on a 12-5 run to
tie the score for the first time all night, at 34-all.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the half, with Lue aggressively pushing the ball
upcourt, the Lakers had taken a 51-50 lead. And the Forum had
itself a new fan favorite, dousing the rookie with hearty calls of
``Loooooo.'' Unfortunately for the Lakers, he couldn't sustain it
in the second half, or save them from a defensive collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ty did what we thought he was capable of doing,'' Rambis said.
``He was real productive in the first half, but he got a little
hesitant in the second half.''
</P>
<P>
   Lue admitted as much: ``I was nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   No one else had an excuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can we explain it? I can't really say,'' Rodman said. ``I
have an answer, but I will keep it to myself. No need to pass
judgment (on) our team tonight. . . . If you are going to play
basketball, then play basketball. If you are not going to play,
then you should sit down and don't play. Don't even bother
coming.''

VAUGHN HURT AS ANGELS WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ If it were a movie script, one would think it
was written by Stephen King, not the Walt Disney Co. After all,
nowhere in a Disney movie does the star attraction get hurt in the
opening scene.
</P>
<P>
   But that's what happened to first baseman Mo Vaughn only minutes
into his first game as an Angel. Vaughn, who signed a six-year, $80
million contract last November, roamed to the visitors' dugout on
the first-base side in an attempt to catch a pop foul hit by the
Cleveland Indians' Omar Vizquel, the second batter of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn reached the edge of the top dugout step, then went one
step too far, falling into the dugout and spraining his left ankle.
He remained in the game and played five innings of the Angels' 6-5
victory, going 0 for 2.
</P>
<P>
   In typical Disney fashion, the game had a happy ending for the
home team. Troy Glaus' two-out double scored Garret Anderson from
first base in the eighth inning to give the Angels the 6-5 lead.
And Troy Percival, following strong performances by fellow
relievers Mark Petkovsek and Mike Holtz (1-0), closed it out with a
1-2-3 ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, who was scheduled to lead off the bottom of the sixth,
was replaced by Jeff Huson to start the top of the sixth so Vaughn
could go for precautionary X-rays, which were negative.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn limped noticeably while he was in the game, and fell at
the plate after hitting a fly ball to left field in his first
at-bat. But Angels medical director Dr. Lewis Yocum said after
Vaughn was taped up ``he felt comfortable enough to continue.
</P>
<P>
   At least for a little while.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, who was on crutches in the clubhouse after the game,
said the sprain is a ``high ankle sprain,'' and he doesn't know how
soon he'll be able to play again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows what will happen (today),'' Vaughn said. ``The main
thing is nothing was broken and we got a win. I seem to heal pretty
fast.''
</P>
<P>
   The ankle is sore and swollen, and even if he can't play for a
few days or is limited to a DH role, the Angels say they are
fortunate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really lucky,'' Collins said. ``We've got Jim Edmonds
down. We lose Mo for an extended period of time... there are only
so many body blows you can take.''
</P>
<P>
   Only a team like the Angels can feel lucky when their star
player is injured. And considering the final score, the Angels have
reason to be happy, thanks to Glaus.
</P>
<P>
   In his eighth-inning at-bat, Glaus drove a fastball from losing
pitcher Steve Karsay (0-1) into the left-center field gap, making
the Edison Field crowd of 39,936 forget about Vaughn for a moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't count on (Vaughn) to carry us all year,'' Glaus said.
``Whatever a person can do to help this team win is what we all
have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's not Mo, then somebody else has to step up,'' Collins
said. ``It was Troy tonight. This is a long race. If everybody runs
their share of the race, it's much easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, another Angels free-agent acquisition struggled in
his debut. Tim Belcher, who signed a two-year, $10.2 million
contract, lasted just 41/3 innings, giving up five runs and six
hits while making 92 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Back-to-back homers by Tim Salmon and Garret Anderson in the
fourth inning off Indians starter Jaret Wright gave Belcher and the
Angels a 3-2 lead, but Belcher surrendered the lead in the fifth
when the Indians scored three runs on four hits.
</P>
<P>
   With Petkovsek providing three scoreless innings of middle
relief, the Angels rallied from their 5-3 deficit with two runs in
the seventh. Shortstop Andy Sheets drove in the first run with his
second hit of the night, and Darin Erstad's sacrifice fly scored
Matt Walbeck (2 for 4) to tie the game, setting the stage for
Glaus.

SHEFFIELD'S HOMER WINS IT 
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Forget brewing, the rivalry between the Arizona
Diamondbacks and Dodgers is brewed and ready to explode.
</P>
<P>
   A memorable opening day was followed by more drama, not to
mention some bad blood, and ended on left fielder Gary Sheffield's
one-out solo homer in the bottom of the 10th as the Dodgers beat
the Diamondbacks 3-2 Tuesday at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   It was Sheffield's first homer, and came on the first pitch he
saw from Diamondbacks reliever Brian Anderson. ``I remember Devon
(White) was telling me all game, `Gary, you're swinging
tentatively,''' Sheffield said. ``I just let it go. He gave me a
changeup, up, and I connected. I was being tentative. Before that,
I wanted to make sure I got a strike to swing at.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Dodgers' second straight extra-inning win doesn't appear
to be a culmination, but rather a beginning, to a feud.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks took umbrage with a pitch Dodgers right-hander
Chan Ho Park threw behind Matt Williams in the sixth inning. It
came one pitch after Williams, who hit his 300th career homer in
the fourth inning, missed another homer by a few feet before the
ball hooked foul.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't intentional,'' Park said. ``It wasn't on purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks, and Williams, thought otherwise. Williams
began shouting toward Park, and in a split second the benches and
bullpens of both teams emptied. Plenty of pushing and jawing took
place, but no punches were thrown.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona manager Buck Showalter said both benches were given
warnings by the umpires.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, they were throwing at Matt,'' Showalter said. ``The
warning after the fact... basically, they gain an advantage by what
they're trying to do.''
</P>
<P>
   During the episode, Diamondbacks starting pitcher Todd
Stottlemyre was animated. He didn't retaliate, but the battle may
not be over. It should also be noted that Bernard Gilkey, who hit a
pair of homers off Kevin Brown on Monday, was hit with a Park pitch
in the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know (Stottlemyre) was frustrated he couldn't do something
for our side,'' Showalter said. ``It makes it frustrating. A 2-2
ballgame makes it tough. But there will be other days.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said: ``It's a little
overreaction. You have to pitch batters inside.''
</P>
<P>
   With a hangover _ not to mention chill _ in the air from the
Dodgers' 8-6 opening-day win, it took a near-altercation and more
late heroics to shake things out. The teams were a combined 0 for
18 with runners in scoring position. The Diamondbacks' runs came on
solo homers by Steve Finley and Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman Adrian Beltre's two-run homer in the second inning
gave the Dodgers a 2-0 lead. Still, the Dodgers were hitless in
their 11 at-bats with runners in scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't worry about it,'' Johnson said. ``The beauty was we
kept putting pressure on them. Every inning you could see it.''
</P>
<P>
   It was especially evident following the Park-Williams
excitement. But with two runners on and none out in the sixth, Eric
Karros grounded into a double play and Mark Grudzielanek flied out.
</P>
<P>
   Two innings later, Karros had another opportunity with runners
on second and third and one out, but he popped out to third.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won,'' Karros said. ``I don't think anyone (cares) how, but
we won.''
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks had their chances, too, but also faltered.
</P>
<P>
   With Dante Powell on second and one out in the ninth, Dodgers
reliever Alan Mills (1-0) got Gilkey to pop to second and Tony
Batista to pop to catcher Todd Hundley.
</P>
<P>
   One inning later, Mills again pitched out of a jam, this time
with David Dellucci on third and one out. After Finley fouled off
six pitches, the right-handed Mills struck out the left-hander for
the second out. Jay Bell grounded to third to end the inning,
setting up Sheffield's blast.
</P>
<P>
   ``The offense will come, and (Tuesday) it was Sheff,'' Hundley
said. ``But you have to keep the defense consistent.''

 KOSOVO CRISIS SERVES AS MODEL OF WARS TO COME  &HT;     By FRANK VIVIANO 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  PARIS _ Two things stand out in the memory of anyone who has
traveled through Kosovo in the past decade: The poverty and the
madness.
<P>
   They are the defining context of the NATO bombing raids on
Serbia and its ethnic Albanian province, and the inevitable frame
for what is to come next. Like the Pentagon's high-tech weapons,
they also define the new face of war.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the appearance of impromptu intervention, the United
States and its allies have actively prepared for this crisis. That
it will almost certainly lead to ground intervention _ to the
Western occupation of Kosovo _ has been quietly part of NATO's
policy assumptions since the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The fear is that such assumptions will forge the template of
conflicts to come, a 21st century of Kosovos, Rwandas and
Kurdistans, in which the anxious decades of the Cold War will come
to be viewed as a carefree Pax Russo-Americana.
</P>
<P>
   The reality is that there is little or no choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what's happening in the world now,'' said Major Greg
Gerovac, a senior task force analyst for the U.S. Army in Europe.
``It's only prudent that we be ready to go into places like
Yugoslavia.''
</P>
<P>
   In March 1994, Gerovac was part of a task force that began
training American infantry battalions, along with their
counterparts from six other NATO countries, for service in a
mythical nation torn by violent nationalism.
</P>
<P>
   The site chosen for the training was Hohenfels, a former Nazi
Wehrmacht base that covers 44,000 fenced-in acres of countryside
near Regensburg in southern Germany. Mock villages were constructed
in the base's rolling hills, with a distinctly Balkan architecture.
Bands of heavily armed ``ethnic militias'' were formed, manned by
GIs wearing guerrilla fatigues and carrying Soviet-manufactured
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Burned cars were scattered around the village streets. Tunnels
were dug under houses to hide terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   The base became ``Vilslakia,'' an impoverished breakaway
province of a multiethnic federation known as ``Danubia.'' It was
provided with all of the now-familiar elements of the Balkan
nightmare _ artillery-shattered churches and mosques, a long
history of communal violence, political leaders for Danubia's
hostile factions, a U.S. State Department Area Report on the
crisis, troublesome journalists on the front lines and military
public relations officers to monitor them.
</P>
<P>
   The trainees were backed up with the full panoply of NATO arms
and equipment deployed in a ground campaign, notably including
Warlord battlefield computers for directing infantry assaults and
the same Apache AH-64A helicopters, outfitted with Hellfire
antitank missiles, that were shipped into Albania on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the NATO soldiers at ``Vilslakia'' were taught to cope
with overwhelming numbers of terrified refugees and with an
``enemy'' driven by blind, irrational sectarian hatred. ``In
evolving military terminology, a lot of what we're training for
here is `operations other than war,' '' said Gerovac, a principal
author of the scenario employed at Hohenfels.
</P>
<P>
   The scenario designed by Gerovac and his colleagues might have
stood for many of the former East Bloc states that crumbled into
violent disarray after 1990. But from the beginning, U.S. Army
Third Infantry officers understood that it was most closely
intended for a very specific contingency.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't stuff we dream up. It's taken from newspapers and
intelligence reports,'' said Lieutenant Colonel John Angell, an
early graduate of the Hohenfels exercises and chief operations
officer for the U.S. mission in Macedonia in 1995. ``There's no
mystery about the model.''
</P>
<P>
   The model was Yugoslavia, and specifically Kosovo. The new face
of war, the cauldron of poverty and madness.
</P>
<P>
   Poverty is a cliche in Third World reporting. But the poverty of
Kosovo _ which lies within a normal day's drive of jet-set
Mediterranean resorts, and less than an hour's flight from Rome and
Munich _ nearly defies words. A single image from the mid-1990s,
sketched into a reporter's notebook in the village of Babus,
halfway between the Macedonian border and the provincial capital of
Pristina, will suffice:
</P>
<P>
   Barefoot children walk to school on an unpaved lane in the dead
of winter, with the thermometer at 15 degrees. No romanticism about
tough peasant constitutions here; these kids are visibly in pain,
hobbling along as fast as they can, thinking only of the kerosene
stove that awaits them in the school.
</P>
<P>
   Except for evening cooking fires, the houses of Babus were
unheated. Long before the bombs and shells began to fall on them,
they were already half-ruined, with tar paper stuck over gaps in
their mud walls. There were no indoor toilets or water pipes, which
would have been frozen in any case. The road was studded with sharp
rocks, as were the fields that surrounded the village. The fields,
planted in a feeble strain of maize, were the main source of
nutrition in Babus.
</P>
<P>
   When Yugoslavia was still whole in 1990, Kosovo's per capita
income was barely one-tenth that of Slovenia, at the opposite end
of the Yugoslav federation, which was itself less than one-half the
per capita income of Western Europe. In short, conditions for the
Kosovars, at home before the war, were only marginally better than
they now are in the swarming refugee camps of Albania and
Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   Those conditions have worsened geometrically since the afternoon
in June 1989, when Slobodan Milosevic delivered his celebrated
speech in Kosovo calling for Serbian rights _ igniting the most
virulent nationalist firestorm to sweep Europe in half a century.
</P>
<P>
   The flames burned their way through Croatia and Bosnia, before
they returned to the countryside where they were lit by Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The poverty was the visible surface of Kosovo, and mostly, but
not entirely, Albanian. The madness was in the shadows, and at that
point _ before the Kosovo Liberation Army began adding its own
tinder to the flames _ it was mostly, but not entirely, Serbian.
</P>
<P>
   Its emblematic figure was Bozidar Pavnovic, a 45-year-old man
who lived with his wife and two daughters next to an abandoned
Serbian cemetery in the town of Vucitrn, about 12 miles north of
Pristina. He had answered Milosevic's call in 1989 and led his
family there on foot from their previous home 90 miles away in
eastern Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Pavnovic has appeared in The Chronicle before, shortly after the
war swept into Bosnia in 1992. But it's instructive to listen to
him again, to know what NATO is up against if _ or when _ it sends
ground troops in after the bombs and missiles. The Vucitrn cemetery
was holy ground, Pavnovic explained, when asked why he had settled
among the tombstones. ``This is Serbia,'' he said in pidgin German.
``We fought and died on this ground.''
</P>
<P>
   But there were no Serbs other than the Pavnovics in the area at
the time, now,  &LR; and he was the cemetery's self-appointed guardian.
His daughters, who wore Serbian monarchist T-shirts, served tea as
he wrote a lengthy essay in the notebook.
</P>
<P>
   An English-speaking friend in Belgrade translated: ``The man
writes that he has come on behalf of all Serbs, the dead and the
living, to bear witness to the truth. He vows that he and his
family will not leave until Vucitrn is once again Serbian and the
Battle of Kosovo is avenged.''
</P>
<P>
   The battle, in which the Turks defeated the Serbs and drove them
out of Kosovo, which was resettled by Albanians, took place in 1389
on the plain where Milosevic gave his speech 500 &LR;   &LR; 600 years later.
</P>
<P>
   An ethnic Albanian schoolteacher in Vucitrn who read the essay
had refused to translate it and spat onto the pages where Pavnovic
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The Belgrade friend, a talented writer in his mid-thirties, saw
nothing wrong with it. `I suppose that makes me a Fascist,` he
said, `but I really don't give a s_.`
</P>
<P>
   The writer's mother is a Jew, a survivor of World War Two
concentration camps. The new face of war is not entirely new.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first principle to be mastered in understanding why
the Kosovo war must be fought yet makes no sense: On a battlefield
of little strategic significance, and no economic value whatsoever,
the crisis is reduced to madness _ to a choice between confronting
it, at dangerously uncertain cost, or allowing it to fester at
greater cost.
</P>
<P>
   The normal policy questions _ what is to be gained, what
rationale can be applied _ are virtually irrelevant, which accounts
for the dazed confusion that seems to hang over the Alliance
partners even as the NATO assault mounts.
</P>
<P>
   In Paris, Rome, Bonn, London and other Western capitals, as in
Washington, the sense is that there are no right answers in the
Kosovar quagmire, only less wrong ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as there rests any hope of obtaining by political
means the resolution of a conflict, the recourse to arms is not
legitimate,'' said Archbishop Jacques Delaporte, president of
France's Commission for Justice and Peace, who has worked since
1992 as a mediator on the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``But today, it seems to me, it is hard to deny that we find
ourselves in one of those situations where _ according to the most
steadfast doctrines of the Church _ the use of arms is legitimate,
as the `last resort,' to avoid an even greater evil,'' he agonized
on Easter Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Morality, in Kosovo, was not on the side of nonintervention,''
said agrees  &LR; Helmut Lippelt, co-founder of Germany's Green Party
and one of Europe's most outspoken pacifists.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, according to unconfirmed reports out of Kosovo,
Vucitrn was leveled by Serbian shells, which is partly why Bozidar
Pavnovic came to mind.
</P>
<P>
   This is the NATO account. In a rival account from Serbian
sources, the town was destroyed by NATO bombs. There is no word on
the fate of the cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   All news out of Kosovo is unconfirmed. With the borders
effectively sealed _ apart from the outward tide of tens of
thousands of ethnic Albanians daily, expelled from the province by
Serbian militia _ rumor has largely replaced fact, in a Balkan
universe where genuine facts are hard to come even under the best
of circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   The last western journalist in Pristina, an Italian radio
reporter, vanished without a trace on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is compounded by the West's military public
relations machine, which honed its ``news management'' skills in
the Gulf War and is diligently applying the lessons as it bombs
Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The press has a right to cover the story, and we have an
obligation to tell our side of it,'' Lieutenant Colonel Angell said
at the Hohenfels NATO base.
</P>
<P>
   ``Depending on how the media are handled, the story that goes
into print will either be ours, or someone else's.''
</P>
<P>
   On March 31, the world's most respected newspapers and broadcast
companies reported that key ethnic Albanian leaders in Kosovo had
been summarily executed. NATO was the source of the report, and
also of the retraction two days later when the dead men
inconveniently appeared on Yugoslav television.
</P>
<P>
   The media war, too, betrays a kind of madness, played out
against the struggle for a land so poor that its value lies only in
historic symbols. It is as though Bozidar Pavnovic had taken charge
of events.
</P>
<P>
   This is the murk in which a host of critical conclusions must be
reached _ the policy conclusions of President Clinton and his
fellow NATO presidents and prime ministers, the public opinion
conclusions of their voters _ and there is no sign that the fog
will soon lift.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the outlook is starkly clear. Despite the
reassuring rhetoric across the Atlantic Alliance, despite the
promises that no ground troops will be deployed, NATO soldiers will
almost surely march into Kosovo _ to assume responsibility, to
confront the madness. To change the political equation by force.
</P>
<P>
   That's the message in the Hohenfels training, in the arrival of
Apache helicopters in Albania, in the steady buildup of Allied
troops in Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The longer the conflict continues, the more that the idea of
Kosovo remaining part of Yugoslavia will become unacceptable,'`
said Jacques Rupnik, director of research for France's National
Foundation of Political Science.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Americans finally come, we will have our own
republic. I am certain of that,'' a Kosovo Albanian leader told The
Chronicle last year.
</P>
<P>
   He insisted that his name be used then. Today, it would be an
act of madness to do so.

 GORE COURTS HIGH-TECH CALIFORNIA  &HT;     By ROBERT B. GUNNISON 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   San Jose, Calif. _ In his 55th visit to California as vice
president, Al Gore put on an impressive display of presidential
campaigning Tuesday, but he got a good taste of how strongly
Republicans plan to challenge him for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   It was a day that included a visit to the Tech Museum in San
Jose and concluded with fund-raisers in the leafy wealth of
Woodside, a San Francisco suburb. Through it all, Gore used his
post as vice president to project himself as the only logical
candidate to succeed President Clinton next year.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, he collected more than $330,000 for his campaign
from Silicon Valley executives who are also being wooed by
Republicans, especially Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Gore told the crowd of about 150 executives that he ``fought
every year'' for research and development tax credits and
``revolutionary changes in public education.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The future of our nation is here in California,'' said the
vice president, a former senator from Tennessee. ``Every time I
come here, there's a bunch of things that weren't here yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Gore's political future is here. California, with 54
electoral votes, is the election's richest prize next year. Clinton
and Gore have won the state twice, breaking 28 years of Republican
domination in presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's latest visit, his first as a candidate, prompted the GOP
to flex its muscles enough to show him that California cannot be
had without a fight. Indeed, a Field Poll in March showed Gore
basically tied with Bush and Elizabeth Dole.
</P>
<P>
   Sensing weakness, Republicans greeted Gore with television ads
that poked fun of his recent claim that he played a vital role in
creating the Internet. The ads, paid for by the Republican
Leadership Council, are running 50 times a day on the four major
networks in the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   In a newspaper advertisement on Monday, 55 high-tech executives
urged Bush to run for president, citing his views on education,
litigation and regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need visionary leaders who understand the New Economy,''
wrote the executives, some of whom have supported Republicans like
former Gov. Pete Wilson in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Bush backers are Jim Barksdale, president and CEO of
Netscape Communications; Bob Herbold, chief operating officer of
Microsoft Corp.; Jeff Henley, chief financial officer of Oracle
Corp; and Steve Behm, a vice president of Cisco Systems.
</P>
<P>
   They praised Bush for ``creating an environment that stresses
personal responsibility over government intervention, and
innovation over regulation.''
</P>
<P>
   But Republican strategists said that despite the display,
Clinton and Gore have dominated the political support of high-tech
executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton and Gore have worked Silicon Valley better than any
politicians in America,'' said Dan Schnur, former Republican
political director for Technet, a bipartisan lobbying organization.
``Republicans have forfeited it.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Republicans hope that as Gore emerges as his own political
personality, separate from Clinton, voter disenchantment will grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot we have to learn about Al Gore,'' said Leslie
Goodman, a Sacramento GOP strategist and friend of Bush. ``He does
not have the personality traits that served the president so
well.''
</P>
<P>
   But the stereotype of Gore as stiff and wooden seemed a bit of a
stretch Tuesday, as he easily mixed with children at the Tech
Museum and watched his wife, Tipper, play drums with a band that
included former Grateful Dead members Mickey Hart and Bob Weir at
the fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   In shirtsleeves despite a chilly wind, Gore mixed with the crowd
in the yard of Janina Pawlowski, founder of E-Loan, an Internet
banking service, while the Flying Others Brothers Band played Dead
tunes.
</P>
<P>
   While the crowd drank wine and mineral water and munched on
shrimp and sushi, a smiling Gore listened to the band play ``Queen
Jane Approximately'' and watched his wife play the congas. ``She's
a pretty good drummer,'' he remarked.
</P>
<P>
   Gore arrived Monday in California, and he and Gov. Gray Davis
paid a visit to a largely Hispanic high school on the west side of
Los Angeles to announce $129 million in federal funds to help the
state's public high schools reduce the size of math and language
arts classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the key changes we can make is to reduce the number of
students in each classroom,'' Gore said. ``I grow a little
impatient with these characters who talk about eliminating the
Department of Education.''
</P>
<P>
   Before heading to a Hollywood fund-raiser, Gore appeared on a
Spanish-language television station, where he chatted in Spanish
with an interviewer.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday morning at Merced Community College, Gore led a
roundtable discussion on improving access to higher education
before heading to San Jose.

<P>
   1. KEATON CARRIES ON The ever-elusive Diane Keaton has survived
Woody, Warren and the Hollywood shuffle. This Garbo-esque recluse
and Oscar winner discusses her latest movie project, in which she
stars and directs and ponders what it means to be the unofficial
Queen of ``quirky.'' By Merle Ginsberg. From W magazine. 1,000
words + photos. 2. 'PHANTOM' OF THE ORCHESTRA ``John Williams
communicates so beautifully,'' says George Lucas, ``that I can make
a silent movie.'' ``The Phantom Menace,'' the eagerly awaited first
film in Lucas' new prequel trilogy to ``Star Wars,'' isn't a silent
movie. But neither were films of the ``silent'' era, which depended
on musical accompaniment to make their full effect. No-one can
think of the ``Star Wars'' movies without hearing John Williams'
music. The success of the film, and of the music, helped restore
the romantic symphonic movie score to popularity. Williams has now
recorded the music for ``Phantom.'' By Richard Dyer. From The
Boston Globe. 3,000 words + photo. 3. CREATING 'THE MATRIX' The
Brothers Wachowski hardly look like guys capable of revolutionizing
action movies. They dress like overgrown schoolboys, with baggy
hip-hop clothes and backwards baseball caps. But the Illinois
natives, in their early 30s, have just directed their second film,
``The Matrix,'' -- it's a new breed of techno-thriller. By Joshua
Mooney. BPI. 1,000 words + photo. 4. MELISSA JOAN HART : A WIZ OF A
WITCH Forget about black cats, bats and bubbling cauldrons.
``Sabrina, The Teenage Witch,'' is the sunniest show about the
black arts ever, thanks to Melissa Joan Hart, 22, the high-spirited
young actress who provides a dependably upbeat tone to the show's
supernatural events. By David Kronke. From TV Guide Canada. 1,300
words + photo. 5. THE GRANDSON ALSO RISES : TONY GOLDWYN STEPS
</P>
<P>
   BEHIND THE CAMERA Tony Goldwyn knows more about Hollywood
history - he is the son of movie producer Samuel Goldwyn Jr. and
grandson of the late, legendary Hollywood impresario Sam Goldwyn -
than about Jewish-American history. But that hasn't stopped the
actor (best known as Patrick Swayze's lethally conniving friend in
the 1990 film ``Ghost,'') from producing and directing ``A Walk on
the Moon,'' a drama about the coming of age of the very Jewish
Kantrowitz family in 1969. ``The Jewish experience was really not a
part of my upbringing, yet I completely identified with this world
when I read the script.'' The emotional fireworks take place
against a backdrop of Woodstock and the Vietnam War, with the first
moon landing looming in the background. By Ian Spelling. 1,300
words + photo.
_______________________________________________________________ 6.
THINK SYNC : BEHIND THE SCENES WITH A TEEN SENSATION The
phenomenally popular band ``N Sync'' has sold millions of albums
and the band members are continually mobbed by teenage girl fans.
The challenge, the band knows, will be to maintain this level of
fame in a sector of the music business known more for quick - and
temporary - success stories than for long-term careers. By Gary
Graff. 1,300 words + photo. 7. CHRIS O'DONNELL ISN'T ROBIN ANY MORE
``I'm not sure those tights from my superhero days would fit any
more,'' laughs Chris O'Donnell. He can joke about ``Batman and
Robin'' (1997,) the film flop that, it is rumoured, almost cost him
his career. Actually, he says, his two-year hiatus from the screen
was intentional. It gave him time to get married and adjust to life
as half of a couple, but it also involved getting away from
Hollywood for a time. Now he's back, with a full slate of projects
and a debut as a producer. Teenage girls are still flinging
themselves at this reluctant sex symbol. By Cindy Pearlman. 1,300
words + photo. 8. CLAIRE DANES REVISITS 'THE MOD SQUAD' Clare
Danes, known for serious work on-screen, is finally getting her
chance to play cops and robbers as the delinquent-turned-cop Julie
Barnes in a big-screen version of the hip ``Mod Squad'' television
series. To try to make it more accessible to her generation,
director/co-writer Scott Silver has updated the story, while
retaining elements of the 1968-1972 series. The action now unfolds
in present-day Los Angeles, though there is plenty of 1970's style
on view. ``What made it appealing and exciting to me is that you
have a bunch of groovy, swanky, rebellious kids fighting the
system,'' Danes says. ``That will always be seductive. It's a
common process that kids have to work through.'' By Ian Spelling.

   Whether left in natural ceramic or covered with bright, primary
glazes, tile has become a fixture in contemporary homes due to its
durability and versatility. Tile is appealing to homeowners
specifically because it doesn't require much maintenance. Glazed
tile is virtually stain-proof. But what about the white, gritty
stuff in between the squares? Try these tips for keeping both tile
and grout looking great.

   Jeffrey P. Bezos revolutionized book buying on-line with his
Internet company, Amazon.com. ``He tapped into a gold mine when he
began selling books on-line. Now his expanded and fast-growing
company is leading the way, and competitors are hot on his trail,''
writes Yleana Martinez in Hispanic magazine. Read how this
35-year-old son of a Cuban immigrant started up in 1995 the company
that today boasts 4.5 million customers in 160 countries. (slugged:

   &UR; ARRANGED MARRIAGES: `THE LOVE WILL GROW' &QL; 
 &UR; By PRADNYA JOSHI &QL; 
 &UR; c.1999 A. magazine &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When it comes time to marry, should one speed up on the dating
track, or would an arranged marriage be the best route? This is the
question that Indian American women have to decide when
contemplating wedded union. Pradna Joshi in A. Magazine gives her
spin on the process. ``There are many second-generation Indian
Americans who find that the arranged marriage question travels
across the seas to perch persistently on their doorsteps,'' she
writes. She, however, is not entirely convinced by either course of
action. But secretly, she hopes love will win the debate in her own
case. (slugged: BC-ARRANGED-MARRIAGES-LIFEBEAT-NYTSF, priority code

   Out of the shadows, soul singer Kelly Price now commands center
stage. Chrisena Coleman talked to the 25-year-old singer,
songwriter and composer about her new album ``Soul of a Woman,''
and her struggles to shed pounds after critics told her she would
never make her mark until she did. ``I am happy being a thick Black
woman,'' Price told her. ``I always felt that God had a plan for me
and He did. He did it in His time, which is fine by me.'' (slugged:

   Q: I recently saw TV commercials for Boston Market, but I
thought it had gone bankrupt. If that's the case, why is the chain
still running commercials?
</P>
<P>
   A: Boston Chicken Inc., owner and operator of Boston Market
stores, filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy in October. Chapter 11 allows a
company to continue operating, including advertising, under
scrutiny by the court while it tries to reorganize its finances to
stay in business.The Boston Market chain was built mainly by
franchisees who borrowed funds from Boston Chicken to open food
shops with sit-in eating. However, a substantial number of the
shops did not prosper and the franchisees were unable to pay back
their loans to Boston Chicken, a major reason for its bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I understand there are several states with no state income
tax. Which ones are they?
</P>
<P>
   A: Nine states have no income tax on earnings: Alaska, Florida,
Nevada, New Hampshire, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington
and Wyoming. Tennessee, however, does tax interest and divident
income. The taxing method among the states varies greatly, with
some taxing all income at a flat rate and others taxing only higher
incomes. A few states assess a percentage of the taxpayer's federal
income taxes. New Hampshire and Alaska also have no general sales
tax.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the seating configuration in economy class for
Delta's new Boeing 777? A recent article discussed business class
seating, but not the ``last class,'' and there's no information on
Delta's web site, either.
</P>
<P>
   A: Coach configuration is 2-5-2, said Delta spokesman Bill
Berry, which means two seats, an aisle, five seats in the middle,
another aisle, and two more seats.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We hear a lot about the Geneva Convention, but I'm confused
on one point. Did the United States ever sign it?
</P>
<P>
   A: The first Geneva Convention (or treaty), providing for the
humane treatment of civilians, prisoners and wounded people in
wartime, was signed in 1864 and accepted by the United States, all
European countries, and some countries in Asia and South America.
</P>
<P>
   Agreements in 1906, 1929, 1949 and 1977 added new provisions.
</P>
<P>
   The United States never ratified the 1977 Geneva Convention
protocols, intended to improve treatment of combatants and civilian
war victims and specifically outlaw hostage-taking and beating of
prisoners. One protocol dealt with international armed conflicts
and the second with domestic or civil warfare.
</P>
<P>
   Although the United States ratified the Geneva Conventions in
1956, the two modernizing protocols fell victim to cold war
politics. In l987, President Ronald Reagan sent the protocol
dealing with domestic conflicts to the Senate and recommended
ratification, but withheld the protocol on international conflicts,
arguing that it provided ``recognition and protection'' to
terrorists and anti-Western guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Foreign Relations Committee, then under Democratic
control, disagreed with the Reagan administration, and refused to
even hold hearings on the second protocol while Reagan blocked the
other.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia signed the 1977 protocols, as have more than 100
other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Christiane Amanpour, CNN's international correspondent, is
married to James Rubin, the State Department spokesman. Is she a
U.S. citizen? When did she begin her TV career?
</P>
<P>
   A: She's a British citizen, according to CNN. Although she was
born in Britain, Amanpour spent many years in the United States,
and holds a bachelor's degree in journalism from the University of
Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   Before joining CNN in 1983 as an assistant to the network's
international assignment desk in Atlanta, Amanpour worked at
WJAR-TV in Providence, R.I., as an electronic graphics designer. In
1981-82, she worked as a reporter, anchor and producer for
WRBU-Radio, also in Providence. Her CNN career has included stints
as a writer and producer in its New York bureau. In 1990, she was
named CNN's correspondent in Frankfurt, Germany. After the Persian
Gulf War she joined CNN's Paris bureau, and in 1994 was named CNN's
chief international correspondent.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Two all-time baseball greats died recently, Cal Ripken Sr.
and ``Birdie'' Tebbetts. Ripken got a lot of well-deserved press,
but almost nothing was reported locally about Tebbetts. Can you
recap his career?
</P>
<P>
   A: George Tebbetts, 86, died March 24 at Sunrise Rehabilitation
Center in Bradenton, Fla., of congestive heart failure. He played
for the Detroit Tigers (1936-47, except for his three years in the
Army); the Boston Red Sox (1947-50); and the Cleveland Indians
(1951-52). In 1,162 games, the right-handed batter hit .270 and
made four All-Star teams. He also was manager of the Cincinnati
Reds (1954-58), the Milwaukee Braves (1961-62) and the Cleveland
Indians (1963-66). A heart attack in 1965 hastened the end of his
managing career, and from 1968 to 1994 he scouted for several Major
League teams.
</P>
<P>
   About the nickname: He was born George Robert Tebbetts on Nov.
10, 1912, in Burlington, Vt. When he was a boy, an aunt said of his
high-pitched voice: ``He chirps like a bird.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent article about troublesome computer dates other than
Jan. 1, 2000, reported that Feb. 29, 2000, is a leap year and
computers may miss the added day. I always thought leap years
occurred every fourth year except in those years divisible by 400,
like the year 2000. Is my memory of my college astronomy classes
failing me?
</P>
<P>
   A: World Book Encyclopedia expains that a leap year (with 366
days) occurs in every year that can be divided evenly by four,
except the years that mark the even hundreds, such as 1500. The
only century years that are leap years are those than can be
divided evenly by 400, such as 1600 and 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Q: President Clinton's job approval rating was reported often in
the media during the Monica Lewsinsky scandal. What is it now?
</P>
<P>
   A: Still up there. The Gallup Organization of Princeton, N.J.,
takes polls constantly. The fastest way to monitor them is online _
www.gallup.com _ by clicking first on Gallup Poll (near the top of
the page), then Poll Trends on the next page, and then Clinton
Presidential Ratings-Job Approval on the page after that.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent job approval poll, taken March 19-21, showed
that 64 percent approved, 33 percent disapproved, and 3 percent had
no opinion. In a one-night poll taken March 25, asking about
Clinton's handling of the Kosovo situation, the numbers showed 58
percent approval, 32 percent disapproval, and 10 percent no
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's average approval rating for the last quarter of 1998
was 66 percent in the Gallup poll. Even during Clinton's Senate
impeachment trial, his job approval numbers remained high, even as
his ratings on honesty and moral character dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In the movie ``Mr. Holland's Opus,'' a beautiful young
actress sang ``Someone to Watch Over Me.'' I thought she was
wonderful, but I haven't seen her since. Who is she, and what can
you tell me about her career?
</P>
<P>
   A: She's Jean Louisa Kelly. The 26-year-old started singing
lessons as a tot, and by age 10 was crooning her grandparents'
favorite George Gershwin and Cole Porter tunes while other kids
were more interested in Duran Duran. She began her professional
career at the age of 11, starring in a community theater production
of ``Annie.''
</P>
<P>
   Her first film was ``Uncle Buck'' (1989), after which she
appeared in the TV movies ``American Shaolin'' (1991) and ``One
More Mountain'' (1994). In 1995's ``Opus,'' she portrayed Rowena
Morgan, who stole the show and almost stole Mr. Holland's (Richard
Dreyfuss') heart. That was followed by a number of appearances on
TV, on stage and in other films, including ``The Fantasticks,'' one
of the most beloved musicals in American history.
</P>
<P>
   A 1994 Columbia University graduate, Kelly married James Pitaro,
a New York attorney, in May 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Oxfam America was listed in an article as one of the relief
agencies accepting contributions for Kosovo refugee assistance.
What does it do, and how much of the money sent to it actually is
passed on to the people in Kosovo who need it?
</P>
<P>
   A: Oxfam _ the name comes from the postal abbreviation for the
Oxford Committee for Famine Relief _ was founded in England to send
relief supplies to refugees in Europe during World War II. It is an
international organization with 11 divisions, one of which is Oxfam
America. The organization says it provides financial, technical and
networking assistance to grassroots groups; advocates policies
addressing structural impediments to ending poverty and hunger; and
educates people about world hunger and poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Oxfam America says it doesn't send relief supplies, preferring
to provide funding and technical support to local organizations for
their own initiatives to ensure that supplies _ such as food,
water, shelter and clothing _ are appropriate to meet local needs
and to help strengthen the local economy.
</P>
<P>
   Peggy Connolly, spokeswoman for Oxfam America in Boston, told
Q&AMP;A that 90 percent of the donated funds will go to help the
refugees in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It was reported that the Federal National Home Mortgage
Association has given a new house to the parents of the seven
surviving octuplets in Texas. Do you have any details? Who do I
contact to voice my disapproval?
</P>
<P>
   A: If your concern is that taxpayer money is being used, that
isn't the case, according to a Fannie Mae spokeswoman in Dallas.
Fannie Mae, a private New York Stock Exchange company, is the
nation's largest source of financing for home mortgages. What
happened is that the previous mortgage holders on the house, which
was built in 1992, weren't able to pay their commitment, so Fannie
Mae took possession of it. After being approached by Rep. Sheila
Jackson Lee (D-Texas), Fannie Mae donated the house to a trust that
benefits the seven children of Nkem Chukwu and Iyke Louis Udobi.
</P>
<P>
   The house was appraised at $274,000, according to real estate
records. You can express your opinion by writing: Fannie Mae,
Southwestern Regional Office, P.O. Box 650043, Dallas, TX
75265-0043.

 &HT;    Turning 50: Reaching the big five-oh no longer viewed as stigma
 &HT;    EDS:Art available.
 &HT;    By Kevin Tankersley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ When Dana Jones was growing up in Waco, she knew
what kind of life she wanted to have.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always wanted to be a mother and stay home with kids,''
said Jones. She feels fortunate that she has been able to do just
that.
</P>
<P>
   Jones reflected on her life as she faces her 50th birthday on
April 29. She and Baylor University women's basketball coach Sonja
Hogg are part of a contingent of women who have recently faced the
half-century mark, a group that includes first lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton, actresses Jane Fonda, Lynn Redgrave and Marlo Thomas, and
musicians Cher, Patti LaBelle, Anne Murray and K.T. Oslin.
</P>
<P>
   While Jones is not sure how she'll feel on the day she actually
hits the big five-oh, ``I'm having fun getting there,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   To celebrate, Jones and 11 friends recently traveled to London.
``It was an all-girl trip,'' she said. ``We did the things girls
do,'' such as shopping and discovering several flea markets.
</P>
<P>
   Jones and 13 other women also have planned a ``girl trip'' to a
bed and breakfast in Salado.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said the transition from 49 to 50 is not much different
than other birthdays in which the new age ends in a zero.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're just another day older,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones has been married to periodontist Scott Jones for 28 years,
and the couple has four sons. Her parents, Newman and Jewel
Copeland, still live in Waco, as do her two sisters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a real family person, and hope some of (my sons) stay
here,'' Jones said. Jones, her sisters and their families still
gather weekly for a meal at the Copelands' house.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 16 for lunch every Sunday at Mom's,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said those in her age bracket aren't considered old by
today's standards, a radical change from her childhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my mother was 27, I was 7 and I thought she was getting
old,'' she said. ``But I don't feel old. I have friends who are in
their 80s and 90s.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, she admits she may have been premature in her
assessment of her mother's aging.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandmother was probably old when she was 50, but not my
mother, and I'm not old at 50,'' she said. ``I can keep up with
anybody. And my eyes still work'' without the benefit of glasses.
</P>
<P>
   Now that her children are older and three no longer live at
home, Jones said there are things she wants to accomplish. She
wants to sharpen her computer skills and do some traveling with her
husband. Several women in Jones' circle of friends have recently
turned 50, or are nearing that milestone, ``and several of them are
in Spanish (language) classes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are lots of fun things to do,'' Jones said. ``I can't
imagine being bored. I think I have 30 good years still left.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Age is really a matter of how you feel in your mind,'' Sonja
Hogg said. ``I don't feel 50, and I don't think 50 is old.''
</P>
<P>
   Hogg and her Lady Bears basketball team celebrated her 53rd
birthday Dec. 20 with a 98-39 win over Southwest Texas State
University. Her 50th birthday was marked by a 68-57 win over the
University of California-Irvine at Baylor's Ferrell Center.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor President Robert Sloan presented Hogg with roses and led
the crowd of 1,120 in a rendition of ``Happy Birthday.''
</P>
<P>
   Sloan himself recently turned 50 and had the tables turned on
him at a Lady Bears game, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Hogg said turning 50 did not bother her as much as when she
moved from 29 to 30. That ``3'' on the front end of one's age is
supposed to signify maturity and responsibility, things she didn't
necessarily feel she possessed, even though she had begun the
women's basketball program at Louisiana Tech when she was only 28.
In 1982, the school won the first-ever women's NCAA basketball
national championship.
</P>
<P>
   On her 40th birthday, while coaching at Deer Park High School,
some of her students met her in the parking lot with a wheelchair.
Hogg good-naturedly allowed them to wheel her through the halls of
the school, amid their cheering classmates, to the teachers'
lounge.
</P>
<P>
   Hogg said she set some career goals for herself _ such as
teaching and coaching at Louisiana Tech _ and was fortunate enough
to meet those fairly early in her life. At the time, she couldn't
picture herself at the mid-century mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first started out, I didn't see myself at 50,'' she
said on a recent morning before leaving for a recruiting trip to
Dallas. ``I thought that was old. Now, 50 is getting younger and
younger and younger.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the players Hogg first coached at Louisiana Tech are now
in their mid-40s, and she is older than most of the parents of her
current players.
</P>
<P>
   Hogg said she doesn't look at her age as having ``only so many
more years to live,'' she said, noting that one of her grandmothers
is 96 and the other died at age 98.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to the next phase'' of life, whatever that
might be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really believe God has a plan for our lives and puts you in
a certain place at a certain time,'' she said. And as for her
current place and time, ``I'm as happy as I've ever been.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Is it known which NATO countries are supplying what in the
way of equipment and personnel in the Yugoslavia campaign, in
addition to what the United States provides?
</P>
<P>
   A: The situation is fluid, so changes are occurring all the
time. As of late March, Britain, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France,
Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain and Turkey
were contributing.
</P>
<P>
   Equipment from NATO countries other than the United States
included CF-18s from Canada; F-16s from Norway, Denmark, Portugal,
the Netherlands, Belgium and Turkey; Harrier jump-jets and Tornados
from Britain; Jaguars and Mirages from France; F/A 18s from Spain;
and Tornados from Italy. Among the naval strike assets from
countries other than the United States were one German and two
British frigates and what NATO described as ``significant Italian,
French, Spanish, Greek and Turkish naval units.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO troops ``in region'' include a 2,000-man European rapid
reaction force, led by France, which set up operations in
Macedonia. Since December, NATO also has operated two on-going
peacekeeping missions in the Balkans: one in Bosnia, a
multinational mission with 31,000 troops, about 6,100 of which are
American; the other in Macedonia, with a border patrol force of
750, about 350 of which are American.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who is eligible for burial at Arlington National Cemetery,
and what is the procedure for making arrangements?
</P>
<P>
   A: The list of those eligible is lengthy and includes, among
others, active duty and retired members of the armed forces;
winners of such decorations as the Medal of Honor, Silver Star and
Purple Heart; former prisoners of war; and spouse, widow, widower
and minor child of those eligible. In some cases, restrictions
apply to those in the various categories.
</P>
<P>
   Arlington's hotline _ 703-697-9486 _ is a resource for
information about eligibility criteria. Or write: The
Superintendent, Arlington National Cemetery, Attn.: ANN-ADI,
Arlington, VA 22211. Internet users can get information at this
site: www.arlingtoncemetery.com/
</P>
<P>
   Q: I will be traveling to Israel, Egypt and Jordan. What are the
regulations about bringing a gun in my baggage?
</P>
<P>
   A: You should contact the official U.S. representatives of the
countries involved:
</P>
<P>
   Israel: Embassy of Israel, 3514 International Drive NW,
Washington, DC 20008 (202-364-5500).
</P>
<P>
   Egypt: Embassy of the Arab Republic of Egypt, 3521 International
Court NW, Washington, DC 20008 (202-895-5400 or 202-966-6342).
</P>
<P>
   Jordan: Embassy of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, 3504
International Drive NW, Washington, DC 20008 (202-966-2861 or
202-966-2664).
</P>
<P>
   Q: We see on TV that the Pentagon spokesman speaking about the
NATO offensive in Yugoslavia is Kenneth Bacon. Wasn't he in trouble
not long ago for releasing some personnel information about Linda
Tripp? What's the status of that?
</P>
<P>
   A: The information you're referring to was printed in the March
23, 1998, edition of New Yorker magazine. It reported that Tripp
had been arrested in 1969, at age 19, on a charge of grand larceny,
and that she later pleaded guilty to loitering. The article said
Tripp, who claimed she was the innocent victim of a prank played on
her by friends who carried out the theft, failed to state on a
Pentagon security clearance form that she had an arrest record.
Tripp said she thought the incident had been cleared from her
record.
</P>
<P>
   As previously reported, Bacon apologized last May for confirming
to New Yorker writer Jane Myer that Tripp had denied on her
personnel record any past arrests. In his apology, Bacon said he
should have consulted with Pentagon lawyers or Tripp's lawyers
before releasing the information, but he said he spoke neither to
White House officials nor Pentagon officials before doing so.
</P>
<P>
   The apology appears to have put the incident to rest.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A colleague's finally seeing ``Saving Private Ryan'' prompts
my question. Did the beach areas of Omaha, Utah, Juno, Gold and
Sword have other names before Allied strategists so dubbed them? We
couldn't imagine some French family in summer 1938 saying, ``What a
beautiful day. Let's go down to Omaha Beach.''
</P>
<P>
   A: The family might have said (in French, of course), something
more like this: ``What a beautiful day. Let's go down to
Port-en-Bessines.''
</P>
<P>
   The beaches chosen for the landings that began June 6, 1944,
stretched from the estuary of the Orne to the southeastern edge of
the Cotentin Peninsula. The names used before then actually
referred to areas, said George Hern Jr., former public relations
director of the French Government Tourist Office. Before 1944, the
area code-named Sword would have stretched between Riva-Bella and
St. Aubin, Hern said; Juno, between St. Aubin and Asnelles; Gold,
between Asnelles and Port-en-Bessines; Omaha, between
Port-en-Bessines and Isigny; and Utah, between Isigny and
Quineville.

go to Arromanches, Hern advised, where they can have lunch at a
hotel near a diorama showing where the Allies went ashore. The
remains of Mulberry, the artificial port built by the Allies to
support the landing, are still there. The American Cemetery, at St.
Laurent near Omaha Beach, ``will drive home to visitors exactly
what happened here,'' Hern said.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I attended an American Physical Society's lecture by Stephen
Hawking, who has been called Albert Einstein's intellectual
successor. Would a transcript of his remarks be available so I can
reflect on them?
</P>
<P>
   A: Unfortunately, Hawking doesn't make transcripts available of
his public lectures. Ben P. Stein, spokesman for the American
Institute of Physics, sister organization of the American Physical
Society, said he was told that Hawking prefers just to give the
lectures, and to avoid making transcripts out of concern that they
might be misused by others or sold for profit.
</P>
<P>
   Stein suggests that those who are interested in Hawking's
theories should read his book, ``The Illustrated Brief History of
Time.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm in the dark about the nickname Blue Devils used by Duke
University. What does it refer to, and how did it originate?
</P>
<P>
   A: Duke is firm on one thing: The nickname isn't satanic. It was
derived from the French Blue Devils, a crack Alpine corps that wore
a blue uniform with a blue beret.
</P>
<P>
   It came to be used by Duke in the early '20s when R. Dwight
Ware, editor-in-chief of the Trinity Chronicle, wrote that the
then-current nicknames _ the Methodists and the Blue and White _
weren't satisfactory. Several meetings of the entire student body
were called, and any and all suggestions were aired. Blue Devils
was suggested by William Lander, an assistant editor of the
Chronicle, although he later admitted that even he wasn't
enthusiastic about it. No name got anywhere near a majority vote,
so at the end of the 1922 school year Duke still was without a team
nickname. The following year, Lander and Mike Bradshaw were named
editors of the Chronicle. They decided that before they departed in
June 1922, the Chronicle would start using the name Blue Devils for
the school and its teams. The name has stuck through the years.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In view of current military operations, I'm curious about
Defense Secretary William S. Cohen. I once heard that he served in
the National Guard. Do you know when, and in what unit or units?
What rank did he attain?
</P>
<P>
   A: Cohen, who was born in 1940, was never in the armed forces,
National Guard or otherwise. In 1988, when he was a Republican
senator from Maine on the Armed Services Committee, Cohen explained
how he avoided being drafted. ``I was exempt: college deferments
and so forth, all the way through,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Is it known which NATO countries are supplying what in the
way of equipment and personnel in the Yugoslavia campaign, in
addition to what the United States provides?
</P>
<P>
   A: The situation is fluid, so changes are occurring all the
time. As of late March, Britain, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France,
Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain and Turkey
were contributing.
</P>
<P>
   Equipment from NATO countries other than the United States
included CF-18s from Canada; F-16s from Norway, Denmark, Portugal,
the Netherlands, Belgium and Turkey; Harrier jump-jets and Tornados
from Britain; Jaguars and Mirages from France; F/A 18s from Spain;
and Tornados from Italy. Among the naval strike assets from
countries other than the United States were one German and two
British frigates and what NATO described as ``significant Italian,
French, Spanish, Greek and Turkish naval units.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO troops ``in region'' include a 2,000-man European rapid
reaction force, led by France, which set up operations in
Macedonia. Since December, NATO also has operated two on-going
peacekeeping missions in the Balkans: one in Bosnia, a
multinational mission with 31,000 troops, about 6,100 of which are
American; the other in Macedonia, with a border patrol force of
750, about 350 of which are American.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who is eligible for burial at Arlington National Cemetery,
and what is the procedure for making arrangements?
</P>
<P>
   A: The list of those eligible is lengthy and includes, among
others, active duty and retired members of the armed forces;
winners of such decorations as the Medal of Honor, Silver Star and
Purple Heart; former prisoners of war; and spouse, widow, widower
and minor child of those eligible. In some cases, restrictions
apply to those in the various categories.
</P>
<P>
   Arlington's hotline _ 703-697-9486 _ is a resource for
information about eligibility criteria. Or write: The
Superintendent, Arlington National Cemetery, Attn.: ANN-ADI,
Arlington, VA 22211. Internet users can get information at this
site: www.arlingtoncemetery.com/
</P>
<P>
   Q: I will be traveling to Israel, Egypt and Jordan. What are the
regulations about bringing a gun in my baggage?
</P>
<P>
   A: You should contact the official U.S. representatives of the
countries involved:
</P>
<P>
   Israel: Embassy of Israel, 3514 International Drive NW,
Washington, DC 20008 (202-364-5500).
</P>
<P>
   Egypt: Embassy of the Arab Republic of Egypt, 3521 International
Court NW, Washington, DC 20008 (202-895-5400 or 202-966-6342).
</P>
<P>
   Jordan: Embassy of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, 3504
International Drive NW, Washington, DC 20008 (202-966-2861 or
202-966-2664).
</P>
<P>
   Q: We see on TV that the Pentagon spokesman speaking about the
NATO offensive in Yugoslavia is Kenneth Bacon. Wasn't he in trouble
not long ago for releasing some personnel information about Linda
Tripp? What's the status of that?
</P>
<P>
   A: The information you're referring to was printed in the March
23, 1998, edition of New Yorker magazine. It reported that Tripp
had been arrested in 1969, at age 19, on a charge of grand larceny,
and that she later pleaded guilty to loitering. The article said
Tripp, who claimed she was the innocent victim of a prank played on
her by friends who carried out the theft, failed to state on a
Pentagon security clearance form that she had an arrest record.
Tripp said she thought the incident had been cleared from her
record.
</P>
<P>
   As previously reported, Bacon apologized last May for confirming
to New Yorker writer Jane Myer that Tripp had denied on her
personnel record any past arrests. In his apology, Bacon said he
should have consulted with Pentagon lawyers or Tripp's lawyers
before releasing the information, but he said he spoke neither to
White House officials nor Pentagon officials before doing so.
</P>
<P>
   The apology appears to have put the incident to rest.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A colleague's finally seeing ``Saving Private Ryan'' prompts
my question. Did the beach areas of Omaha, Utah, Juno, Gold and
Sword have other names before Allied strategists so dubbed them? We
couldn't imagine some French family in summer 1938 saying, ``What a
beautiful day. Let's go down to Omaha Beach.''
</P>
<P>
   A: The family might have said (in French, of course), something
more like this: ``What a beautiful day. Let's go down to
Port-en-Bessines.''
</P>
<P>
   The beaches chosen for the landings that began June 6, 1944,
stretched from the estuary of the Orne to the southeastern edge of
the Cotentin Peninsula. The names used before then actually
referred to areas, said George Hern Jr., former public relations
director of the French Government Tourist Office. Before 1944, the
area code-named Sword would have stretched between Riva-Bella and
St. Aubin, Hern said; Juno, between St. Aubin and Asnelles; Gold,
between Asnelles and Port-en-Bessines; Omaha, between
Port-en-Bessines and Isigny; and Utah, between Isigny and
Quineville.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors in search of the invasion story 55 years later should
go to Arromanches, Hern advised, where they can have lunch at a
hotel near a diorama showing where the Allies went ashore. The
remains of Mulberry, the artificial port built by the Allies to
support the landing, are still there. The American Cemetery, at St.
Laurent near Omaha Beach, ``will drive home to visitors exactly

<P>
   Q: I recently saw TV commercials for Boston Market, but I
thought it had gone bankrupt. If that's the case, why is the chain
still running commercials?
</P>
<P>
   A: Boston Chicken Inc., owner and operator of Boston Market
stores, filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy in October. Chapter 11 allows a
company to continue operating, including advertising, under
scrutiny by the court while it tries to reorganize its finances to
stay in business.The Boston Market chain was built mainly by
franchisees who borrowed funds from Boston Chicken to open food
shops with sit-in eating. However, a substantial number of the
shops did not prosper and the franchisees were unable to pay back
their loans to Boston Chicken, a major reason for its bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I understand there are several states with no state income
tax. Which ones are they?
</P>
<P>
   A: Nine states have no income tax on earnings: Alaska, Florida,
Nevada, New Hampshire, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington
and Wyoming. Tennessee, however, does tax interest and divident
income. The taxing method among the states varies greatly, with
some taxing all income at a flat rate and others taxing only higher
incomes. A few states assess a percentage of the taxpayer's federal
income taxes. New Hampshire and Alaska also have no general sales
tax.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the seating configuration in economy class for
Delta's new Boeing 777? A recent article discussed business class
seating, but not the ``last class,'' and there's no information on
Delta's web site, either.
</P>
<P>
   A: Coach configuration is 2-5-2, said Delta spokesman Bill
Berry, which means two seats, an aisle, five seats in the middle,
another aisle, and two more seats.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We hear a lot about the Geneva Convention, but I'm confused
on one point. Did the United States ever sign it?
</P>
<P>
   A: The first Geneva Convention (or treaty), providing for the
humane treatment of civilians, prisoners and wounded people in
wartime, was signed in 1864 and accepted by the United States, all
European countries, and some countries in Asia and South America.
</P>
<P>
   Agreements in 1906, 1929, 1949 and 1977 added new provisions.
</P>
<P>
   The United States never ratified the 1977 Geneva Convention
protocols, intended to improve treatment of combatants and civilian
war victims and specifically outlaw hostage-taking and beating of
prisoners. One protocol dealt with international armed conflicts
and the second with domestic or civil warfare.
</P>
<P>
   Although the United States ratified the Geneva Conventions in
1956, the two modernizing protocols fell victim to cold war
politics. In l987, President Ronald Reagan sent the protocol
dealing with domestic conflicts to the Senate and recommended
ratification, but withheld the protocol on international conflicts,
arguing that it provided ``recognition and protection'' to
terrorists and anti-Western guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Foreign Relations Committee, then under Democratic
control, disagreed with the Reagan administration, and refused to
even hold hearings on the second protocol while Reagan blocked the
other.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia signed the 1977 protocols, as have more than 100
other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Christiane Amanpour, CNN's international correspondent, is
married to James Rubin, the State Department spokesman. Is she a
U.S. citizen? When did she begin her TV career?
</P>
<P>
   A: She's a British citizen, according to CNN. Although she was
born in Britain, Amanpour spent many years in the United States,
and holds a bachelor's degree in journalism from the University of
Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   Before joining CNN in 1983 as an assistant to the network's
international assignment desk in Atlanta, Amanpour worked at
WJAR-TV in Providence, R.I., as an electronic graphics designer. In
1981-82, she worked as a reporter, anchor and producer for
WRBU-Radio, also in Providence. Her CNN career has included stints
as a writer and producer in its New York bureau. In 1990, she was
named CNN's correspondent in Frankfurt, Germany. After the Persian
Gulf War she joined CNN's Paris bureau, and in 1994 was named CNN's
chief international correspondent.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Two all-time baseball greats died recently, Cal Ripken Sr.
and ``Birdie'' Tebbetts. Ripken got a lot of well-deserved press,
but almost nothing was reported locally about Tebbetts. Can you
recap his career?
</P>
<P>
   A: George Tebbetts, 86, died March 24 at Sunrise Rehabilitation
Center in Bradenton, Fla., of congestive heart failure. He played
for the Detroit Tigers (1936-47, except for his three years in the
Army); the Boston Red Sox (1947-50); and the Cleveland Indians
(1951-52). In 1,162 games, the right-handed batter hit .270 and
made four All-Star teams. He also was manager of the Cincinnati
Reds (1954-58), the Milwaukee Braves (1961-62) and the Cleveland
Indians (1963-66). A heart attack in 1965 hastened the end of his
managing career, and from 1968 to 1994 he scouted for several Major
League teams.
</P>
<P>
   About the nickname: He was born George Robert Tebbetts on Nov.
10, 1912, in Burlington, Vt. When he was a boy, an aunt said of his
high-pitched voice: ``He chirps like a bird.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent article about troublesome computer dates other than
Jan. 1, 2000, reported that Feb. 29, 2000, is a leap year and
computers may miss the added day. I always thought leap years
occurred every fourth year except in those years divisible by 400,
like the year 2000. Is my memory of my college astronomy classes
failing me?
</P>
<P>
   A: World Book Encyclopedia expains that a leap year (with 366
days) occurs in every year that can be divided evenly by four,
except the years that mark the even hundreds, such as 1500. The
only century years that are leap years are those than can be
divided evenly by 400, such as 1600 and 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Q: President Clinton's job approval rating was reported often in
the media during the Monica Lewsinsky scandal. What is it now?
</P>
<P>
   A: Still up there. The Gallup Organization of Princeton, N.J.,
takes polls constantly. The fastest way to monitor them is online _
www.gallup.com _ by clicking first on Gallup Poll (near the top of
the page), then Poll Trends on the next page, and then Clinton
Presidential Ratings-Job Approval on the page after that.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent job approval poll, taken March 19-21, showed
that 64 percent approved, 33 percent disapproved, and 3 percent had
no opinion. In a one-night poll taken March 25, asking about
Clinton's handling of the Kosovo situation, the numbers showed 58
percent approval, 32 percent disapproval, and 10 percent no
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's average approval rating for the last quarter of 1998
was 66 percent in the Gallup poll. Even during Clinton's Senate
impeachment trial, his job approval numbers remained high, even as
his ratings on honesty and moral character dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In the movie ``Mr. Holland's Opus,'' a beautiful young
actress sang ``Someone to Watch Over Me.'' I thought she was
wonderful, but I haven't seen her since. Who is she, and what can
you tell me about her career?
</P>
<P>
   A: She's Jean Louisa Kelly. The 26-year-old started singing
lessons as a tot, and by age 10 was crooning her grandparents'
favorite George Gershwin and Cole Porter tunes while other kids
were more interested in Duran Duran. She began her professional
career at the age of 11, starring in a community theater production
of ``Annie.''
</P>
<P>
   Her first film was ``Uncle Buck'' (1989), after which she
appeared in the TV movies ``American Shaolin'' (1991) and ``One
More Mountain'' (1994). In 1995's ``Opus,'' she portrayed Rowena
Morgan, who stole the show and almost stole Mr. Holland's (Richard
Dreyfuss') heart. That was followed by a number of appearances on
TV, on stage and in other films, including ``The Fantasticks,'' one
of the most beloved musicals in American history.
</P>
<P>
   A 1994 Columbia University graduate, Kelly married James Pitaro,
a New York attorney, in May 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Oxfam America was listed in an article as one of the relief
agencies accepting contributions for Kosovo refugee assistance.
What does it do, and how much of the money sent to it actually is
passed on to the people in Kosovo who need it?
</P>
<P>
   A: Oxfam _ the name comes from the postal abbreviation for the
Oxford Committee for Famine Relief _ was founded in England to send
relief supplies to refugees in Europe during World War II. It is an
international organization with 11 divisions, one of which is Oxfam
America. The organization says it provides financial, technical and
networking assistance to grassroots groups; advocates policies
addressing structural impediments to ending poverty and hunger; and
educates people about world hunger and poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Oxfam America says it doesn't send relief supplies, preferring
to provide funding and technical support to local organizations for
their own initiatives to ensure that supplies _ such as food,
water, shelter and clothing _ are appropriate to meet local needs
and to help strengthen the local economy.
</P>
<P>
   Peggy Connolly, spokeswoman for Oxfam America in Boston, told
Q&AMP;A that 90 percent of the donated funds will go to help the
refugees in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It was reported that the Federal National Home Mortgage
Association has given a new house to the parents of the seven
surviving octuplets in Texas. Do you have any details? Who do I
contact to voice my disapproval?
</P>
<P>
   A: If your concern is that taxpayer money is being used, that
isn't the case, according to a Fannie Mae spokeswoman in Dallas.
Fannie Mae, a private New York Stock Exchange company, is the
nation's largest source of financing for home mortgages. What
happened is that the previous mortgage holders on the house, which
was built in 1992, weren't able to pay their commitment, so Fannie
Mae took possession of it. After being approached by Rep. Sheila
Jackson Lee (D-Texas), Fannie Mae donated the house to a trust that
benefits the seven children of Nkem Chukwu and Iyke Louis Udobi.
</P>
<P>
   The house was appraised at $274,000, according to real estate
records. You can express your opinion by writing: Fannie Mae,
Southwestern Regional Office, P.O. Box 650043, Dallas, TX
75265-0043.

 &HT;    Quintessential Murphy bio is `Best Revenge'
 &HT;    By Scott Eyman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ It's a pleasure to welcome Living Well
is the Best Revenge ($16.95) to the Modern Library. Essentially a
slightly expanded New Yorker profile, Calvin Tomkins' book tells
the story of Gerald and Sara Murphy, the guiding lights of the
Paris expatriates of the '20s and the dedicatees of Tender is the
Night.
</P>
<P>
   In its cool, understated way, it seems superior to Amanda Vail's
recent biography of the Murphys _ more mystery, more bouquet.
</P>
<P>
   Living Well is the Best Revenge was first published in 1971 and
has dated not at all. Tomkins has contributed a new introduction
and rewritten the ending to accommodate new information about
Gerald Murphy's wonderful paintings, including the cover, which
features Cocktail, in the collection of the Whitney.
</P>
<P>
   Saskatoon? . . .
</P>
<P>
   According to the Places Rated Almanac, the best-read readers
live in the following places, from the top: Fort Wayne, Ind.;
Jamestown, Va.; Cleveland; Bangor, Maine; Champaign, Ill.; Columbus
and Toledo, Ohio; Long Island, N.Y.; Saskatoon, Canada; and Iowa
City, Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   I assume this is somebody's idea of a joke. Including Wheeling,
W. Va., might have made it too obvious.
</P>
<P>
   Things to look forward to . . .
</P>
<P>
   In case you're not sick of the travails of Wild Bill Clinton and
his pursuers, hang on. The Washington Post's Susan Schmidt is
co-writing To the Point of Knives: The Triumph and Tragedy of Ken
Starr for HarperCollins, and St. Martins has signed up Joe Conason,
from the always entertaining New York Observer, and Gene Lyons of
the Arkansas Democrat to write The Hunting of the President: The
Ten-Year Campaign to Destroy Bill and Hillary Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the perennially best-selling Ann Rule is writing a
book on the Anne Marie Fahey/Thomas Capano affair, for Simon and
Schuster.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, over on the fiction front, Scott Turow will have a new
book out this fall. Personal Injuries is about a sleazy attorney
who pays off corrupt judges to avoid going to trial. Little, Brown
will publish.
</P>
<P>
   Things to avoid . . .
</P>
<P>
   Henry Holt, one of the classier publishers, has laid off about
20% percent of its work force in an attempt to restore
profitability after some down years. Holt is also cutting its list;
after publishing about 250 books a year under various imprints,
Holt will put out about 200 titles this year.

   TURNING-FIFTY _ WACO, Texas _ When Dana Jones was growing up in
Waco, she knew what kind of life she wanted to have. ``I've always
wanted to be a mother and stay home with kids,'' said Jones. She
feels fortunate that she has been able to do just that. Jones
reflected on her life as she faces her 50th birthday on April 29.
She and Baylor University women's basketball coach Sonja Hogg are
part of a contingent of women who have recently faced the
half-century mark, a group that includes first lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton, actresses Jane Fonda, Lynn Redgrave and Marlo Thomas, and
musicians Cher, Patti LaBelle, Anne Murray and K.T. Oslin. While
Jones is not sure how she'll feel on the day she actually hits the
big five-oh, ``I'm having fun getting there,'' she said.

 &HT;    Use my cell phone? 10-4, good buddy
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In his Monday column, editorial page editor
Arnold Garcia Jr. accused me of falling ``into the ranks of
yuppiedom'' because I own a cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, well, Arnold Garcia is wearing a tie in his mug shot. And
as a new cell phone owner, I'd like to complain about this rush to
judgment people make when they see somebody with a cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   Y'all figure us cell phone users eat out of blenders and shop at
Saks. Pony poop.
</P>
<P>
   That's why today I'm suggesting we cell phone users get rid of
our upwardly mobile image by adopting handles.
</P>
<P>
   Why haven't unjustly branded cell phone users thought of this
before? Just like CBers, we talk from our vehicles, right? Like
CBers, we've got our ears on, good buddy. Like CBers, when pricked,
we bleed. The similarities between cell phoners and CBers are at
least slightly eerie.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is that cell phoners are assumed to be stuffier than
CBers and less likely to smack someone over the skull with a pool
stick.
</P>
<P>
   This image problem would be fixed if we cell phoners would take
on handles like the Jolly Joker, Little Nanner or the Skanky Hanky.
</P>
<P>
   To lend panache to the cellular phone movement, I've decided to
take the lead and become the first cell phone operator in America
with a cell phone handle. Right now, I'm leaning toward calling
myself either the Analog Animal or the Digital Dummy.
</P>
<P>
   The second of the two handles would be more appropriate, because
I can't figure out how to use all of the options on my new cell
phone. For starters, I should never have fooled with the alarm
clock setting. Now I can't make it stop going off every night at
midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Seriously, I do have a legitimate reason for getting a cell
phone. I'm traveling around Texas, working on a book about goofy
stuff all over the state. So I'm visiting areas where pay phones
are sometimes hard to find. A few weeks back, I attended the World
Championship Rattlesnake Races in San Patricio, northwest of Corpus
Christi.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the folks who entered this contest brought their own
snakes. But I may have been the only person there who brought his
own cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   Since I'm working in these out-of-the-way spots, my wife, Sally,
figured I should carry a cell phone in case of emergencies, like
finding yourself at a rattlesnake race. The suggestion sounded
good. But there's one problem. When you talk on a cell phone,
sometimes you sound like you have library paste in your mouth.
</P>
<P>
   When I called my wife at home to check in from the rattlesnake
races, I said over my cell phone, ``I just pulled into the parking
lot at the rattlesnake races.''
</P>
<P>
   But from the response I got from my wife, I think it came out
sounding like, ``I just ------ ---- the ----ing --- -- --- ---.''
Because she responded, ``I can't understand a word you're saying.''
</P>
<P>
   See, I could understand her just fine because she wasn't talking
on a cell phone. But she couldn't understand me, because I was.
</P>
<P>
   It could have been worse. I'm lucky my message didn't come out,
``I just pulled into --- -a------ lot -- --- rattlesnake ----s.''
My wife might have called 911.
</P>
<P>
   But who's complaining? My new cell phone tells darn good time.
And the alarm works daily at midnight sharp. And I still don't have
to wear a tie.

 &HT;    Nothing frivolous about breastfeeding
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Dana Derungs knew what some people would think if
she sued Wal-Mart for preventing her from breast-feeding at its
Lebanon, Ohio store two years ago:
</P>
<P>
   Just another frivolous lawsuit, clogging up the courts. Rush
Limbaugh material. Bob and Tom, for sure.
</P>
<P>
   But there's nothing frivolous about the right of a nursing
mother to go out in public. The only thing frivolous about this
case is that, in 1999, it should be an issue at all.
</P>
<P>
   The 28-year-old Lebanon mother of two had never been to a La
Leche League meeting, never been an activist of any sort until the
day in April 1997, when she took her six-week-old son, Devin,
shopping at Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
   She sat down at a bench outside the women's dressing room with
the baby, and, before she could even start nursing, a sales clerk
approached her and asked her to nurse the baby in the restroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked her if she would feed her child in the restroom, or
eat her own lunch there,'' Derungs recalled, ``and of course she
said no.''
</P>
<P>
   She fled in tears, but came back two weeks later with about 80
nursing mothers, babies and their fathers.
</P>
<P>
   An activist had been born. Derungs testified before the Ohio's
Women's Policy and Research Commission, created by the state
legislature to study women's issues, and filed a complaint with the
Ohio Civil Rights Commission.
</P>
<P>
   For two years, Derungs said, she has attempted to convince
Wal-Mart to offer an apology and adopt a breastfeeding-friendly
policy. ``Enough time has passed,'' she said. ``I don't want to see
any other mother go through what we went through.''
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart spokesperson Laura Pope said she couldn't comment on
the specifics of the case because of the lawsuit, but added, ``We
do allow mothers to breastfeed in our stores.'' Yet, six months
after the incident, Jennifer Gore of New Lebanon said she was asked
to stop breastfeeding her son at a Wal-Mart. ``She was feeding her
child so discreetly that the clerk had to ask her, 'How did you get
your child to stop crying?''' said attorney Susan Brasier, who
represents Derungs and Gore in their lawsuit against Wal-Mart
Stores Inc. ``If she had said, 'I just shifted positions,' nobody
would have known the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed in Montgomery County Common Pleas Court on
behalf of Derungs and Gore and their sons, asks for unspecified
damages. What they are really seeking, Brasier said, is a woman's
fundamental right to nurse her baby: ``What you see with a nursing
mom is less than what you'd see in the checkout line at the grocery
store on the cover of Cosmopolitan. It's socially acceptable to use
breasts to sell automobiles, but not for the purpose for which God
intended them.''
</P>
<P>
   Derungs wants an apology and a policy from Wal-Mart. That's not
a bad start, but Ohio mothers need more than that. Under current
law, the showing of the nipple in public is a fourth-degree
misdemeanor for a first-time ``offender.'' Does this mean
breastfeeding mothers can be charged with a crime? Maybe. Of
course, we could forever remove the ambiguity with a change
specifically making it legal to breastfeed in public. However,
since 1994 such legislation has been defeated.
</P>
<P>
   Now, state lawmakers have another chance. Dayton's state Sen.
Rhine McLin and state Rep. Dixie Allen have introduced a bill, now
in judiciary committee, granting a mother the right to breastfeed
her child in public.
</P>
<P>
   ``What did they do in the Wild West to get some milk, unless
they had a goat?'' McLin said. ``What did Eve do?
</P>
<P>
   ``It just amazes me there's such uproar about doing the right
thing. Why belabor this issue when there are so many issues more
pressing?''
</P>
<P>
   Talk about frivolous.

 &HT;    Vegan holier than cow?
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Animal terrorists finally forced the removal of a
``Jesus was a vegetarian'' billboard in Amarillo, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Threats were made that animals would be mutilated if the
billboard wasn't taken down.
</P>
<P>
   The company that owns the billboard space bowed to threats and
public outcries and removed the message, according to People for
the Ethical Treatment of Animals, which put up the billboard.
</P>
<P>
   Faxed letters to the editor from PETA attempted get the word out
in time for Easter Sunday that Jesus was a vegetarian.
</P>
<P>
   After concluding its argument that Jesus ate only vegetables,
PETA's letter said, ``On Easter Sunday, please bless the animals,
not by saying grace over pieces of them on plates, but by sharing a
peaceful, loving vegetarian dinner.''
</P>
<P>
   The billboard's message about Jesus' diet was erected in
Amarillo where the nation's press came to cover television star
Oprah Winfrey's trial for insulting Texas cows.
</P>
<P>
   Texas lawmakers provided an irresistible opportunity for Texas
cattlemen to make themselves and the state look foolish. In 1995,
lawmakers passed the now-infamous ``veggie libel law.''
</P>
<P>
   The next year when Oprah said on her show that she was going
stop eating hamburgers after hearing reports of mad cow disease,
about 100 Amarillo cattlemen slapped leather in a quick-draw
contest to hire lawyers to sue Oprah for ``false disparagement of
perishable food products.''
</P>
<P>
   Oprah rode into town with her band of top-gun lawyers for the
big high-noon showdown. She also brought along her entire broadcast
retinue to continue her show while her lawyers blew away the
cattlemen's lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Besides lawyers, an entire television cast and the usual media
mob, the Oprah trial also attracted the animal rights crowd, which
sided with the cows over the cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   As the world knows, Oprah mopped the courtroom floor with the
Texas cattlemen and rode out of town taking her lawyers, her
television cast, the national media and the imported animal rights
activists.
</P>
<P>
   What was left was the ``Jesus is a vegetarian'' billboard. And
now, according to PETA, even the message that Jesus wouldn't
swallow what Texas cattlemen were selling has left town.
</P>
<P>
   To bolster its argument that Jesus was a vegetarian, PETA quotes
philosopher and theologian Arthur Schopenhauer. ``European
priestcraft,'' he wrote, ``knows no limits to its disavowal and
blasphemy against the Eternal Reality that lives in every animal.
... The fact that Christian morality takes no thought for beasts is
a defect in the system which is better admitted than perpetuated.''
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I don't see how Arthur's quote proves that Jesus was
a vegetarian.
</P>
<P>
   But PETA's Web site, www.JesusVeg.com, has more theological
arguments to support its claim. The animal rights organization says
the practice of animal sacrifices during Jesus' time was an excuse
for humans to eat animal flesh. Jesus, PETA argues, condemned
animal sacrifices and eliminated the practice altogether at the
Last Supper, which is described as a vegetarian Passover meal.
</P>
<P>
   Interesting, if true, as an admired columnist used to say.
</P>
<P>
   I'm no theologian, but I recall where the Bible describes how
Jesus fed about 5,000 followers, not counting women and children,
who hadn't eaten for several days. He fed them fish and bread by
turning several loaves of bread and a couple of fish into more than
enough food for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   At another time he helped some fishermen catch fish.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't sound like evidence of vegetarianism to me.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, I'm fond of fish. And I'm not saying that just
because I fear getting sued for bad-mouthing some Texan's catfish.

 &HT;    Standing her ground at Morris Brown
 &HT;    By Ernie Suggs
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ By her early teens, Morris Brown College President
Dolores Cross already had learned to make tough decisions without
blinking an eye, backing down or walking away.
</P>
<P>
   At the age of 8, she overcame a stuttering problem by writing
and directing a school play, giving her more confidence. At 14, she
had to get a job to pay her family's rent in a Newark, N.J.,
housing project after her mother was institutionalized.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have the classic middle-class upbringing you normally
associate with college presidents,'' said Cross.
</P>
<P>
   So when she faced angry faculty members last month and told them
that, despite their pleas, they probably would be fired, it wasn't
completely out of character.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, she fired 13 of them, fulfilling a promise to clean
house and restore, in her opinion, academic integrity at the
118-year-old historically black institution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people need to be released,'' said Kisha Hopson, a
22-year-old senior. ``I think she probably has the best interest of
the school and the students at heart with the decisions she is
making.'' Cross came to Morris Brown after a two-year stint at the
GE Fund, the philanthropic arm of General Electric, where she
served as president, and, most recently, as Distinguished Professor
of Leadership and Diversity at the City University Graduate School
and University Center in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1990 and 1997, she was the president of Chicago State
University, becoming the first woman and only African-American
president of a public college in Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   ``She took over an institution really in trouble in every sense
_ academically, low morale ... that was neglected for years,'' said
Marva Jolly, who has taught in CSU's art department for 16 years.
``Now, CSU is recognizable.''
</P>
<P>
   Cross eliminated tenure based on longevity in favor of more
scholarly research. She also engineered a $30 million expansion of
the university. The school experienced a 60 percent enrollment
increase, its retention rate rose to 67 percent from 18 percent,
and its graduation rate increased 57 percent. Cross' final year at
CSU came shortly after her mother died. ``It just seemed to be the
time,'' said Cross. ``Her transition became my own.''
</P>
<P>
   Ozie Johnson Tucker, who in the 1940s became the first
African-American woman to pass the telephone operator's exam in New
Jersey, raised her two daughters alone in Newark. Cross said that
when she was 13, racism and pressure led her mother to an emotional
breakdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sister and I went to live in the Salvation Army,'' Cross
said. ``At 14, I had to work to get money. We had to learn to be
independent very young.''
</P>
<P>
   Cross said her mother eventually got better and returned to
work, which inspired her daughters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw my mother as a strong person who took risks. She always
encouraged me to be involved.'' Cross' plans for Morris Brown call
for creating more pre-college programs to attract, cultivate and
groom potential students as early as the sixth grade. She also
wants to set up partnerships with graduate schools in which Morris
Brown would serve as a feeder school.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the middle part of her plan that is the stickiest:
improving the academic quality on campus. ``We have to make sure
when the students come here, they have a quality education,'' said
Cross.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to get people who are excited about what they want to
achieve. I want Morris Brown to create a model of what I think
HBCUs (historically black colleges and universities) should do, a
model for what should happen at a quality undergraduate
institution.''

 &HT;    Democratic dynamo looks to empower party
 &HT;    By Brian E. Crowley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOCA RATON, Fla. _ Monte Friedkin reaches up to put Bill
Clinton's gold braided, yachtsman's cap back on his head.
</P>
<P>
   Balancing it carefully on Clinton's cardboard noggin, Friedkin
grins at the life-size figure that dominates the office of one of
Florida's biggest contributors to the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   With the shades-wearing, saxophone-playing image of Clinton
peering over his left shoulder, Friedkin is tooting his own horn.
He wants you to know that the days of a placid Democratic Party in
Palm Beach County are over. He intends to turn the county party
into the most powerful political force in the state.
</P>
<P>
   What worries Republicans is that Friedkin has the money,
contacts and influence to make it happen.
</P>
<P>
   Already he has opened a party office, hired staff, bought
computers and now he is planning to raise more than $250,000 in
November with a dinner for 1,000 that will feature House Minority
Leader Dick Gephardt, a personal friend.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and he says he wouldn't be surprised if Vice President Al
Gore shows up.
</P>
<P>
   He says this with the casual confidence of a man who has
contributed and raised millions of dollars for Democratic
candidates _ someone who expects phone calls to be returned by the
most important Democrats on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is fairly well-known on the national scene, particularly in
the Senate,'' says Ken Klein, who worked with the Democratic
Senatorial Campaign Committee when his boss, U.S. Sen. Bob Graham,
chaired the committee in 1994. ``He's also known to the president
and vice president.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, Monte Norman Friedkin, a Youngstown, Ohio, native who
attended the University of Miami and returned to South Florida in
1985, was content being a member of an elite group of big
contributors who work largely in obscurity. Now he talks about the
radical right, the disarray in the Democratic Party and his
determination to destroy the one and rebuild the other even if it
means overpowering the state party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no personal agenda,'' insists the 59-year old Friedkin,
who is also vice president of the American Israeli Public Affairs
Committee, one of the strongest lobbying groups in Washington.
``I'm not running for public office. I have no desire to run for
public office. I'm here to make sure that we have a viable party
that elects Democrats and that once they are elected that the party
keeps their feet to the fire and makes them do what they are
supposed to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am,'' he says unapologetically, ``a very partisan
Democrat.''
</P>
<P>
   At Eleanor Roosevelt's knee
</P>
<P>
   As a young boy, he remembers being one of three Jews in school.
Coming from a wealthy family made it even harder. ``I wasn't just a
Jew, I was a rich Jew, and the other kids beat the hell out of
me,'' he says adding with a laugh. ``I learned to run faster than
any kid in school.''
</P>
<P>
   Eleanor Roosevelt spent a weekend at his father's house when
Friedkin was a boy, leaving an impression that remains with him
today. ``She was helping to raise bonds for Israel, and I watched
her that weekend sitting on our living room couch talking to the
press, and she was very direct,'' he remembers. ``She never
flinched.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who know Friedkin say he never flinches either.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very direct. You know where he stands. There is no
ambiguity,'' Klein says. ``And if he tells you he will do
something, you can count on him to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Friedkin's abiding passion for Israel is well-known on Capitol
Hill. He is a major contributor to Jewish causes, a founder of the
National Jewish Democratic Council, of which he is national
chairman, and a frequent critic of those, both Jewish and gentile,
who oppose his views.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can a woman, especially a Jewish woman, be a Republican?''
he says. ``First of all, they are all pro-choice, and most
Republicans are not pro-choice. If it were up to Republicans, women
would not have the right to vote.''
</P>
<P>
   From car dealer to aluminum manufacturer, Friedkin has been
involved in numerous businesses. His wife, Skeets, is well-known in
the world of charity. They have two daughters and a son, Shawn, 35,
who founded Stand Among Friends, an organization involved in spinal
injury research. Shawn Friedkin was paralyzed in a 1992 car
accident.
</P>
<P>
   Friedkin credits state Sen. Tom Rossin and Rep. Lois Frankel,
both West Palm Beach Democrats, with getting him involved in the
county party. Both lawmakers were part of a move to use the local
organization to undermine the state party.
</P>
<P>
   Unhappy with state party Chairman Mitch Ceasar, elected
officials who did not have the power to oust him began exploring
the idea of funneling contributions to the Palm Beach County party
office instead of the state office.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea was to bleed the state party and just put it out of
business,'' says a Tallahassee Democrat who helped put together the
plan. ``Now with Ceasar out, we won't have to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Ceasar agreed to step down after getting a
face-saving job helping to organize next year's Democratic National
Convention. With him out of the way, Panama City car dealer Charlie
Whitehead, who led the party in the 1980s, agreed to become the new
state chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Whitehead says he was given assurances that the plan to make
Palm Beach County the de facto state party was no longer going to
happen. ``Their commitment to me was that the money would continue
to come to the state party,'' Whitehead says.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats should be excited about having someone like Friedkin
working with the party, says Whitehead. ``If he wants to help, I
sure want to use him. He has a lot of energy, and he doesn't mind
spending money.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of that money and energy is going toward making sure that
every Republican officeholder in Palm Beach County has Democratic
challenger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel strongly there is no justification for having a
majority of Republicans on the county commission. It's illogical,''
he says. ``The majority of voters in the county are Democrats
(278,000 registered Democrats to 225,000 registered Republicans),
therefore why should we have Republicans control the commission?''
</P>
<P>
   Three- to five-year plan
</P>
<P>
   He talks about bringing more young people into the party and
increasing the size of the paid staff so volunteers can be better
organized. ``People who are just sitting around taking up space
have to go,'' Friedkin says. ``You have to get rid of people who
don't want to do anything, inspire people who do want to do
something to do more, and you have to bring in new people.''
</P>
<P>
   One challenge is getting newer younger Democrats working well
with older Democrats. ``It's not always easy but what we have to do
is to try and get the older generation, which is very good at what
it does, to train the younger generation,'' Friedkin says. ``At the
same time the older generation has to be willing to listen to new
ideas and new ways of doing things.''
</P>
<P>
   He also plans to discourage Democrats from running against other
Democrats. In his view there are more than enough Republicans to go
after. And he warns that if any of the county's 21 Democratic Clubs
ever endorses or helps a Republican candidate ``it won't be a
Democratic Club for long, I'll throw them out.''
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't be the first time. When he assumed the chairmanship
last year, the first thing he did was kick 322 members off the
executive committee for missing three or more meetings during the
year. A few weeks later, facing an angry, booing roomful of
Democrats, Friedkin relented, admitting his blunt move ``wasn't as
sensitive as it should have been.''
</P>
<P>
   Expecting party discipline, Friedkin has even discouraged the
clubs from inviting Palm Beach County Sheriff Bob Neuman to their
meetings because he is a Republican. ``One club invited me to a
meeting he was going to be at and I said if he is there, I will
embarrass him.'' Friedkin said. ``They didn't invite him.''
</P>
<P>
   It's part of his overall plan, which he says could take three to
five years, to not only build a powerful county party but to make
it one where, ``an endorsement from the Palm Beach County
Democratic Party means something.''
</P>
<P>
   With his wall covered with pictures of Friedkin and Bill,
Friedkin and Hillary, Friedkin and Bill and Hillary, he remains
loyal to Clinton, who he believes would be considered a great
president if only for that other thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people under stress get better. Some people under stress
get worse. I'm more interested in the big picture,'' Friedkin says.
``It's more important to me what's happening to this country,
what's happening to the economy, what's happening to the people.
That's why I'm doing this.''

 &HT;    Emery Worldwide has vested interest in airport expansion
 &HT;    By Jim Bebbington
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Dayton is unveiling a proposed billion-dollar,
long-range expansion of the Dayton International Airport to
increase its cargo handling capacity so Emery Worldwide could more
than double its local work force over 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   The first phase of the plan would have Emery invest more than
more than $300 million and add 1,700 employees over the next five
years. Emery's investment would be coupled with a projected $200
million in federal, state and local spending to lengthen one
airport runway, reroute U.S. 40 and buy 1,100 acres of rural land
near the airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are completely behind this,'' said Tim Strauss, Emery vice
president for transportation and logistics. ``Without growth and no
changes, we are at a distinct disadvantage (in the industry).''
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear Tuesday how much Dayton might contribute. But
City Commissioner Mary Wiseman, said, ``Based on what I've heard, I
am confident that the city will work in partnership with Emery to
do whatever we can do in the short term to allow Emery to grow in
Dayton.''
</P>
<P>
   Nora Lake, executive director of the Miami Valley Regional
Planning Commission, said, ``This is a major project both for the
communities involved and for the region as a whole.''
</P>
<P>
   Airport officials and Emery last week presented the 20-year plan
to local city managers and elected officials who make up the
MVRPC's transportation committee. Today, they will take it to
Dayton city commissioners.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, called the Air Cargo Capacity Enhancement Master Plan,
projects:
</P>
<P>
   Emery Worldwide would employ 10,260 in Dayton by 2018, up from
4,200 now.
</P>
<P>
   Overall airport expansion would be $1.2 billion for a fourth
runway, an extensive system of new roads around the airport and a
new Interstate 75 interchange by 2018.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next 10 years, Emery would double the number of its
planes taking off and landing at the airport from 100 to 200,
including an increase in daytime flights.
</P>
<P>
   To come to reality, portions of the plan would have to be
approved by Dayton, then face scrutiny by federal aviation,
transportation and environmental agencies. The MVRPC would have to
add the roadway changes to the region's list of priorities for them
to be eligible for federal funds.
</P>
<P>
   Planning for the first phase would begin after a series of
public meetings to be held this year. An environmental impact study
would be done over the next two years, with the buying of land for
phase one and rerouting of U.S. 40 beginning in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Emery has its North American sorting hub at Dayton
International, and its air traffic is growing so quickly that, by
2003, Emery planes would experience an average delay of 10 minutes
waiting to take off if the airport is unchanged, company
projections show.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is very vital to us, to reduce those waits,'' said Tim
Wendling, vice president of hub operations. ``If we have that sort
of queuing up on the ramps we are not meeting our outbound
schedules and our customers won't get their freight on time.''
</P>
<P>
   The company also projects an increase in the number of cargo
planes using the airport during the day in the next decade. The
long-range plan calls for a new runway to be built by 2018 to
accommodate the company's daytime flights.
</P>
<P>
   Wendling said the report's projected business growth is
conservative, and may happen even faster.
</P>
<P>
   Emery is the industry leader in air cargo for packages heavier
than 70 pounds, and is in its second year handling priority mail
for the U.S. Postal Service.
</P>
<P>
   Wendling said the company has spent $65 million updating its
buildings and cannot invest more unless the airport's
infrastructure grows, too. The company foresees much of its
projected new business coming from international air cargo.
</P>
<P>
   Lake said Emery cannot bid on contracts to handle more U.S.
Postal Service mail unless it grows.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton officials said Emery's immediate need is for an
1,100-foot runway extension and the rerouting of U.S. 40.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton's airport investments have not always panned out. While
investments for Emery have been fruitful, the city's passenger
terminal expansion has been largely underused since USAir closed
its Dayton hub.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it were the city alone doing it, then I would be highly
uncomfortable,'' Wiseman said. ``If you look at the investment
Emery (would make), then that changes the dynamic. This is not the
city spending its dollars hoping that Emery will stay. It is the
city supplementing a huge dollar investment in Dayton.''
</P>
<P>
   The project would be the second large expansion planned for a
local air freight company. Airborne Express in Wilmington expects
to add more than 40 flights a day over the next five years to the
107 flights it now handles.
</P>
<P>
   Residents north of the Dayton airport in Miami County and south
in Vandalia and Butler Twp. have voiced concerns over the noise
from increased air traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gotten worse just in the last year and a half,'' said
George Burger, a Monroe Twp. resident.
</P>
<P>
   Burger said the airport plan includes so many long-range
projections he wants to know what projects are likely to go first
and what will take 20 years to complete.
</P>
<P>
   The master plan projects spending $40 million in next few years
for buying property, including sites affected by the increased
airport noise, according to a project summary.
</P>
<P>
   The airport would expand into largely rural areas to the north
and southwest. A 4,300-foot extension of the north-south runway,
called for in the second phase to be built after 2004, would run
into southern Miami County and force a rerouting of several Monroe
Twp. roads.
</P>
<P>
   The company has been growing, and added 975 jobs since 1997.
Many of the employees work part time, but the jobs come with
medical and dental benefits. The proposed new jobs are not
specified in the long-range plan.
</P>
<P>
   The plan calls for the creation of a joint economic development
district, which allows cities and townships to agree beforehand to
share tax revenues from business developments.
</P>
<P>
   Miami County Commissioner Arthur Haddad, president of the
MVRPC's transportation committee, said his county endorses the
project because Emery employs Miami County residents and supports
other firms in the county.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was one of our selling points (to attract businesses)
that we used when I was with the city of Troy,'' Haddad said.
``While (Emery) isn't a corporate citizen to Miami County it is
definitely an advantage to Miami County.''
</P>
<P>
   The long-range plan comes on the heel of a request for federal
airport funds to renovate runways and build a runway apron and
hangar for Emery.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question the cost is high, but the cost of not
making some of this investment would be even higher,'' said Dan
Curtis, vice president of the Miami Valley Economic Development
Coalition.

 &HT;    NCR to debut customer-friendly system
 &HT;    By Laura A. Bischoff
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ NCR Corp. is unveiling a new system that will
allow large companies to simulate the cozy familiarity of an
old-time neighborhood retailer by using huge computer databases.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Walters, NCR's director of Worldwide Marketing Customer
Interaction Solutions, said ``Interaction Plus'' will help
companies get and keep customers, who increasingly are less loyal
and more demanding.
</P>
<P>
   The system will let businesses collect customer data and then
turn around and tailor information to the customer the next time
that person does business with the company. For example,
information is collected when a customer goes on a company Web
site, calls the company's service center or uses a kiosk, such as
an automatic teller machine. The info is fed into a data warehouse
for analysis of customer behavior and sent to the Web site, call
center or kiosk the next time the customer does business.
</P>
<P>
   For a consumer, it might mean the ATM wishing you happy birthday
or asking you if you want your usual $50 withdrawal. Or a customer
will be greeted by a clerk on the other end of the phone who knows
his name, address and purchasing history.
</P>
<P>
   Walters said the market has evolved from the neighborhood
retailer who remembers each customer to mass marketing to
customized marketing on a massive scale.
</P>
<P>
   Walters said Interaction Plus is targeted toward
consumer-intensive industries such as retail, banking, utilities,
transportation and insurance. It will sell for about $1 million,
including the software, hardware and professional services, Walters
said.
</P>
<P>
   Walters said Interaction Plus capitalizes on NCR's two
strengths: point of sale interactions and data warehouses. NCR is
betting that customer management will be a big hit and it has
trademarked the slogan ``transforming transactions into
relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   Based in Dayton, NCR is a Fortune 500 company with $6.5 billion
in annual sales. It makes automatic teller machines, point-of-sale
scanners and registers and data warehousing systems.

 &HT;    Shoshanna's unmentionables
 &HT;    By Loretta Grantham
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ I didn't ask the Jerry Seinfeld
question, so consider him _ and his four-year tryst with this gal
who was in high school when they met _ not mentioned. They split in
'97.
</P>
<P>
   So, if he's unmentionable, what else is there? Her
unmentionables. Literally.
</P>
<P>
   Shoshanna Lonstein, 23, has launched a line of lingerie so
insanely popular that stores can't keep it in stock. There are
frocks, too, and soon-to-be sportswear separates, all for the
well-endowed woman.
</P>
<P>
   Lonstein, you may recall from those photo ops with
what's-his-name, is extremely top heavy. Thing is, she's thin as
Wassa Crispbread everywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   Hate her, hate her, hate her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always had trouble finding clothes that fit,'' says
Lonstein, showing off her creations at C. Orrico in Palm Beach
recently. ``Clothes were only made for one body type, and it wasn't
mine.''
</P>
<P>
   She arrives in white jeans, a snug knit shirt and sandals,
looking like a college kid on spring break. Soon, though, she slips
into a strapless (strapless?!) royal blue stretch poplin dress, one
she designed.
</P>
<P>
   Supportive elements such as heavy-duty elastic, hidden laces and
metal boning (like in a corset) keep the top in place. In similar
fashion, Lonstein's bustiers also contain serious infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   Her gingham thongs, meanwhile _ sold inside matching handbags
for $55 _ are more, shall we say, free form. Dresses range from
$125 to $160.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Shoshanna'' line, which debuted last fall, sold out in
three days at Bloomingdale's in Manhattan. Now, there are waiting
lists at some boutiques, and sales are expected to top $1million
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm totally overwhelmed,'' says Lonstein, who graduated from
UCLA in '97 (art history) and lives at home with mom and dad on
Fifth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew a 9-to-5 office job wasn't creative enough for me, and
I wasn't sure what I wanted to do. But my parents were, like, `OK,
it's time to go to work now.'''
</P>
<P>
   Lonstein apprenticed at a lingerie company, then her dad, Zach,
a computer bigwig, loaned her the cash to get going. Critics, of
course, carp she'd be nowhere without yesteryear's 15 minutes of
fame.
</P>
<P>
   Although she won't discuss her ex (she stormed out of the room
recently when a 48 Hours chap uttered the S word), Kate White,
editor in chief at Cosmopolitan, has said the comedian fell for
what folks are seeing in Lonstein now: ``Her beauty and charisma.''
</P>
<P>
   I, however, have fallen for the idea of stuffing scanty panties
in a frilly purse and pulling down 55 bucks. Now THAT'S funny.

 &HT;    After a disappointing freshman season, Jasper Sanks is out to
prove he belongs in the SEC.
 &HT;    By Chip Towers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ To learn that you are not the person everybody
thinks you are is one of life's toughest lessons. Ask Georgia's
Jasper Sanks, who just now is beginning to find out who he is.
</P>
<P>
   Sanks signed with Georgia out of Columbus' Carver High with much
fanfare. A USA Today and Parade Magazine All-American, people said
he was going to be the next Herschel Walker, the next Rodney
Hampton, the next Garrison Hearst. And Sanks believed them.
</P>
<P>
   But two things went wrong for Sanks: He failed to qualify for
admission to Georgia, and, after a year at Fork Union Military
Academy, he failed to maintain the physical conditioning he needed
to compete in the SEC.
</P>
<P>
   What resulted was one of Georgia's biggest recruiting busts. In
what was supposed to be an ``impact season,'' Sanks instead played
in two games and finished with 65 yards on 10 carries.
</P>
<P>
   But that was then. Now the Bulldogs are in the final week of
spring practice, and as they prepare for Saturday's G-Day Game,
Sanks is emerging as integral to their plans, going into his
sophomore season.
</P>
<P>
   A year wiser and 19 pounds lighter, a new and improved Sanks
sees the 1999 football season as one of redemption. And not to
prove that he is what everybody thinks he is, but rather to prove
that he is who he is and that that's OK.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can still be that caliber of player,'' Sanks said, referring
to the early comparisons to Walker and others, ``but right now,I'm
just being Jasper.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanks' new attitude is the result of the teachings of
running-backs coach Leon Perry. The former Oklahoma star running
back has a special relationship with Sanks and is fiercely
protective of 6-foot, 219-pound sophomore.
</P>
<P>
   His basic message to Sanks has been this: Forget what everybody
says about you and be yourself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jasper Sanks is Jasper Sanks, not Robert Edwards, not Patrick
Pass, not Herschel Walker,'' Perry said. ``He's Jasper, son of Joe
and Jeanette Sanks, and that's all he needs to be. He may not be
living up to the expectations that the media and fans put on him,
but those are their expectations, not ours. We're pleased with what
he's doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's coaches weren't always so pleased. Sanks showed up in
Athens last summer grossly out of shape. He weighed 238 pounds,
nearly 30 pounds heavier than he was in high school, and the
closest thing to weightlifting he had done all summer was pick up
the TV remote control off the coffee table.
</P>
<P>
   ``I regret not training like I should have coming out of Fork
Union,'' Sanks said. ``I took the summer off, took everything for
granted. I was just so happy I got my (SAT) scores. I had been so
far away from home in a military school, once I got back, I just
kind of relaxed. I just laid on my butt all summer, for about two
months straight.''
</P>
<P>
   So Sanks was already behind when he arrived with the rest of
Georgia's freshmen in August. Then, just a couple of weeks into
workouts, he suffered a severely sprained ankle. As the Bulldogs
hurriedly prepared for their season-opener, Sanks fell further and
further back in their plans. By the first game, he wasn't even on
the radar screen.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, Sanks remained fresh in the minds of Georgia's
notoriously impatient fans. So when the Bulldogs' running game
began to struggle in mid-season, the shouts began to rain down from
the stands at Sanford Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want Jasper! We want Jasper!'' fans called out. Sanks
cringes at the memory of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, I kind of got caught up in that, thinking I should
be out there playing. But I can see now that I wasn't ready,''
Sanks said. ``It was kind of weird, people in the stands yelling
for the coaches to put me in and asking me questions on the
sideline during the game. I mean, it's been hard, one of the
hardest things for me to deal with since I got here.
</P>
<P>
   Sanks' first lesson was to stop listening, the second to start
working. With those instructions heeded, the Bulldogs are beginning
to see results.
</P>
<P>
   Entering Saturday's G-Day, Sanks is working both at fullback and
tailback, and he's getting a lot of snaps in the Bulldogs' one-back
set. He is competing for playing time with seniors Robert Arnaud
and Patrick Pass and juniors Nick Callaway and Brett Millican.
Three freshmen will join the competition in August.
</P>
<P>
   Sanks still isn't giving any signs that he might become the next
great running back in Georgia history, but indications are that he
will be a productive member of the 1999 team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jasper Sanks is a good running back, but he's not Herschel
Walker,'' Perry said. ``All running backs are individuals. Jasper's
the biggest back we have, and he can do a lot of things for us. But
he's not out there trying to be Herschel Walker anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanks said, ``I think I learned a lot the last year. I wasn't
practicing and putting forth the effort that I should have. I was
just thinking my name alone was going to get me in and it was going
to be a cakewalk. College is a new ball game; it's a new level and
I didn't understand the work it takes.''

 &HT;    Looking for the perfect cup of joe? Starbucks 'coffee
specialist' knows where to find it
 &HT;    By Jeff Houck
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ In the realm of cool jobs for coffee
lovers, Eric Chastain's gig is definitely a double espresso topped
with a hearty dollop of froth.
</P>
<P>
   A ``coffee specialist'' who samples hundreds of cups of joe for
Starbucks each year, Chastain uses his tastebuds to choose which
batch of beans grown by farmers from Kenya to Guatemala should be
featured in the coffee chain's shops. The philosophy: If someone is
going to pay $3 for a cup of coffee, they're going to want their
money's worth in flavor.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent visit to West Palm Beach to promote a new line
of milder coffees and dark chocolates, Chastain explained what it
takes to slurp coffee for a living.
</P>
<P>
   At the Starbucks testing lab in Seattle, Chastain and other
specialists take turns cupping (tasting) samples. Just as judges at
a dog show look for standard shapes of each pooch, Starbucks'
tasters rely on an internal checklist called a ``flavor memory.''
Sumatran, for example, should be bold and intense with an earthy
aroma, while New Guinea Peaberry should be acidic and brisk and
slightly herbal.
</P>
<P>
   To save himself from a monster case of the jitters, Chastain
spits out each sample after smelling, slurping then swirling it in
his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Chastain started in 1993 as counter help at the Starbucks near
his home in San Francisco, became a shift supervisor and answered
an internal job posting for a coffee specialist's job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got into it for the love of coffee,'' he said. ``It's an
unusual job in a small industry. But there's a lot of romance to
it. People tend to stay in the business. It gets into your blood.''
</P>
<P>
   Q and A: So Eric Chastain knows his beans. But how much does he
really know about coffee culture?
</P>
<P>
   Q: If you were in a fancy restaurant and the waiter secretly
substituted Folger's crystals for your regular coffee, would you be
able to tell?
</P>
<P>
   A: That strikes me as amazing that people couldn't tell. Because
it's not just a Folger's thing. It's instant coffee. If you have
soluable coffee, it's pretty easy to tell if it's instant coffee
against any brewed coffee.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Whatever happened to the ``coffee achievers''?
</P>
<P>
   A: That was in the mid-'80s, right? Those commercials where
people said, ``I'm a coffee achiever!'' Wasn't David Bowie one of
those? Dionne Warwick was one. Ann and Nancy Wilson from the band
Heart were coffee achievers.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Yes.
</P>
<P>
   A: I have no idea what happened to them. I remember the comic
strip Bloom County had Opus the penguin talking about being a
coffee achiever. I cut that one out, it was so funny. But that was
before I was in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Juan Valdez, the Colombian guy who picks ``the richest coffee
in the world'' with help from his burro. What does his name
translate into in English? Quickly.
</P>
<P>
   A: John Smith? John something . . .
</P>
<P>
   Q: Time's up. John Valdez.
</P>
<P>
   A: Oh.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Next question: What were the names of the man and the dog who
walked across country and were invited into strangers' houses to
drink coffee in those Maxwell House TV commercials?
</P>
<P>
   A: (Long pause) B.J. and the Bear?
</P>
<P>
   Q: Hal and Duke.
</P>
<P>
   A: Oh. I had no idea. B.J. and the Bear . . . wasn't that a TV
show with Greg Evigan?
</P>
<P>
   Q: Yes. And Bear was a chimpanzee, not a dog.
</P>
<P>
   A:Oh.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Here's the Barbara Walters question: If you were a coffee
flavor, what kind of coffee flavor would you be?
</P>
<P>
   A: I would be Sulawesi. It's my favorite Indonesian coffee. It's
herbal, exotic, smooth, it's elegant and has a lot of character . .
. and may be slightly eccentric.
</P>
<P>
   Brew the best you can brew
</P>
<P>
   The basics for making a tasty cup of coffee are pretty simple.
Here are Starbucks' tips for brewing a perfect pot:
</P>
<P>
   Water _ Regardless of your brewing method, start with cold,
fresh (preferably filtered) water. Heat it to just shy of boiling,
around 190-205 degrees Fahrenheit, to best extract the coffee's
full range of flavors.
</P>
<P>
   Grind _ Use the correct grind for your coffee maker. The design
of the coffee maker determines how long the coffee grounds and
water will mingle in the brewing process. Cone-shaped filters
produce more flavor, for example, because water flows more evenly
through the coffee.
</P>
<P>
   Proportion _ The classic recipe for a great cup of coffee is 2
tablespoons of ground coffee for every 6 ounces of water. Adding
hot water to already-brewed coffee is the best way to adjust its
strength. A warning: Just because the lines on your coffee maker's
carafe reads ``12 cups'' doesn't mean you can fill 12 mugs of
coffee. Serving sizes vary.
</P>
<P>
   Freshness _ Start with fresh beans. Buy only what you can use in
a week's time. Store them in a dark, airtight container at room
temperature. Freezing coffee is OK on a short-term basis, but the
flavor can be damaged by freezing the same batch more than once.
</P>
<P>
   And, how hot should your batch be? Coffee's flavor deteriorates
when it's left on a heat source. Enjoy it fresh, within the first
30 minutes, or transfer it to a thermal carafe. Never reheat
coffee. And especially don't zap it in the microwave. ``That's
considered violence against coffee,'' said Eric Chastain, a
Starbucks coffee taster.

 &HT;    Looking for the perfect cup of joe? Starbucks 'coffee
specialist' knows where to find it
 &HT;    By Jeff Houck
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ In the realm of cool jobs for coffee
lovers, Eric Chastain's gig is definitely a double espresso topped
with a hearty dollop of froth.
</P>
<P>
   A ``coffee specialist'' who samples hundreds of cups of joe for
Starbucks each year, Chastain uses his tastebuds to choose which
batch of beans grown by farmers from Kenya to Guatemala should be
featured in the coffee chain's shops. The philosophy: If someone is
going to pay $3 for a cup of coffee, they're going to want their
money's worth in flavor.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent visit to West Palm Beach to promote a new line
of milder coffees and dark chocolates, Chastain explained what it
takes to slurp coffee for a living.
</P>
<P>
   At the Starbucks testing lab in Seattle, Chastain and other
specialists take turns cupping (tasting) samples. Just as judges at
a dog show look for standard shapes of each pooch, Starbucks'
tasters rely on an internal checklist called a ``flavor memory.''
Sumatran, for example, should be bold and intense with an earthy
aroma, while New Guinea Peaberry should be acidic and brisk and
slightly herbal.
</P>
<P>
   To save himself from a monster case of the jitters, Chastain
spits out each sample after smelling, slurping then swirling it in
his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Chastain started in 1993 as counter help at the Starbucks near
his home in San Francisco, became a shift supervisor and answered
an internal job posting for a coffee specialist's job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got into it for the love of coffee,'' he said. ``It's an
unusual job in a small industry. But there's a lot of romance to
it. People tend to stay in the business. It gets into your blood.''
</P>
<P>
   Q and A: So Eric Chastain knows his beans. But how much does he
really know about coffee culture?
</P>
<P>
   Q: If you were in a fancy restaurant and the waiter secretly
substituted Folger's crystals for your regular coffee, would you be
able to tell?
</P>
<P>
   A: That strikes me as amazing that people couldn't tell. Because
it's not just a Folger's thing. It's instant coffee. If you have
soluable coffee, it's pretty easy to tell if it's instant coffee
against any brewed coffee.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Whatever happened to the ``coffee achievers''?
</P>
<P>
   A: That was in the mid-'80s, right? Those commercials where
people said, ``I'm a coffee achiever!'' Wasn't David Bowie one of
those? Dionne Warwick was one. Ann and Nancy Wilson from the band
Heart were coffee achievers.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Yes.
</P>
<P>
   A: I have no idea what happened to them. I remember the comic
strip Bloom County had Opus the penguin talking about being a
coffee achiever. I cut that one out, it was so funny. But that was
before I was in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Juan Valdez, the Colombian guy who picks ``the richest coffee
in the world'' with help from his burro. What does his name
translate into in English? Quickly.
</P>
<P>
   A: John Smith? John something . . .
</P>
<P>
   Q: Time's up. John Valdez.
</P>
<P>
   A: Oh.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Next question: What were the names of the man and the dog who
walked across country and were invited into strangers' houses to
drink coffee in those Maxwell House TV commercials?
</P>
<P>
   A: (Long pause) B.J. and the Bear?
</P>
<P>
   Q: Hal and Duke.
</P>
<P>
   A: Oh. I had no idea. B.J. and the Bear . . . wasn't that a TV
show with Greg Evigan?
</P>
<P>
   Q: Yes. And Bear was a chimpanzee, not a dog.
</P>
<P>
   A:Oh.

PHYSICIAN PROFILES LACK SIGNIFICANT DATA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOLORES KONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The state medical board, under fire for its lax
handling of three doctors facing criminal charges, is also failing
to keep its noted on-line physician profiles updated with such
information as doctors' criminal convictions, paid malpractice
claims, and hospital discipline actions.
</P>
<P>
   A Globe review this week has found missing data on at least two
physicians convicted of Medicaid fraud in the early 1990s and one
physician whose insurer paid approximately $5 million last year in
a malpractice case involving a brain-injured baby.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a comparison of earlier versions of profiles with
more recent ones for some doctors shows an apparent whitewashing of
the record.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a 1996 profile for one physician gave ``academic
research fraud'' as the reason for his 1995 resignation from
Brigham and Women's Hospital, but a 1998 one deleted the reason for
the hospital discipline. That physician, Andrew J. Friedman, has
since had his Massachusetts medical license suspended and does not
currently appear on the board's profiles.
</P>
<P>
   The board's acting executive director, Penelope Wells, had no
explanation for that change, noting that the profiles usually use
the reason for disciplinary action cited by the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Introduced in late 1996, the first-in-the-nation on-line
profiles were created in part as a response to a Globe Spotlight
series in 1994 on medical malpractice, and have been considered the
state Board of Registration in Medicine's premier achievement. The
profiles are designed to include such basic information as
education, board certification, as well as malpractice payments
made and hospital or medical board discipline in the last 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Information had been found missing in some of the profiles early
on in their roll-out, and state officials promised in 1997 to
improve them.
</P>
<P>
   But, ``It's becoming more and more difficult to trust the
board,'' said Linda DeBenedictis, president and founder of the
Norwood-based New England Patients' Rights Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're almost at a crisis situation,'' DeBenedictis said. ``I
think the public is losing faith. How can we believe anything
they're going to tell us by their track record?''
</P>
<P>
   State officials defended the profiles, saying they rely on
malpractice insurers, doctors, and courts to provide the relevant
information. If they don't get the information, they can't include
it, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a snapshot, not a biography. There's 97 percent
accuracy,'' said Kim Hinden McDonald, spokeswoman for the state
Office of Consumer Affairs. ``The physician profile is the first
step, not the last step,'' she said. ``It should not be the last
word in choosing a doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the imperfections, Wells, who has also been the board's
long-time general counsel, said the Massachusetts physician
profiles continue to lead the nation. ``They include more
information _ by far _ than exists in any other state. Most other
states aspire to have as much information on their profiles as we
have.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells, who took over the reins from Alexander ``Sandy'' Fleming
after he resigned last month under criticism, added, ``That's the
best we can do. We're not going to certify that we have everything
on a particular physician. We can only include the information that
we have.''
</P>
<P>
   But in interviews, attorneys, physicians, and consumer advocates
familiar with the board's workings say even when the board has the
information, it fails to show up on the profiles. If incomplete or
tardy reporting by doctors, courts, or malpractice insurers is a
source of the problem, the board should crack down and enforce the
reporting requirements, they add.
</P>
<P>
   ``They shouldn't have to wait for somebody to come knocking on
their doors,'' said attorney Andrew C. Meyer, who specializes in
representing patients who have been harmed by medical malpractice.
``They stick their head in the sand.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Paul D. Weinstein pleaded nolo contendere, or no contest, to
Medicaid fraud in 1992, yet his physician profile says ``Dr.
Weinstein has had no criminal convictions in the past 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview this week, Weinstein said he reported his plea
to the board and has obeyed all requirements and regulations since
then. ``They're well aware of it, that situation,'' said Weinstein,
whose medical license was revoked by the board in 1992, but was
reinstated with probation in 1995. ``It was . . . a difficult
chapter in our life, and we've certainly complied with all the
regulations since then.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Benjamin Weinberg, was convicted of Medicaid fraud in 1991,
but the board's physician profile also says ``Dr. Weinberg has had
no criminal convictions in the past 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   The attorney who represented both Weinberg and Weinstein said
that both men have paid their dues and followed all reporting
requirements, and that the board knows of the prior convictions.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the convictions this week, Wells was surprised
to find the information missing from the public profiles. She
checked the board's internal database and found the Medicaid
conviction information there. ``This would be a glitch,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   After talking with one of her staff members involved with the
profiles, Wells discovered that the off-site ``web master'' who is
maintaining the database for the board has taken all the criminal
convictions data off line for more than a week, in order to add
information about serious misdemeanors.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no notification of that in the public profiles,
only the misleading statement that there are no criminal
convictions.
</P>
<P>
   In another physician profile, for Dr. Dennis Lund of Children's
Hospital, there was no information late on Monday about a
settlement made by his insurer in a case involving a baby injured
by an apparent potassium overdose.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Meyer, who represented the baby's family, remembers
getting the settlement of about $5 million from Lund's insurer
about a year ago and was outraged that the payment hasn't yet been
reported on the board's profile. ``They're simply circumventing
every reporting requirement,'' Meyer said.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, a spokesman for the Risk Management Foundation of the
Harvard Medical Institutions, which services Lund's malpractice
insurer, said the payment had been reported to the state medical
board, although he could not say when or divulge the amount.
</P>
<P>
   Upon checking with her staff late Monday, Wells said she was
surprised to find that the insurer had made the report only that
day, the same day a Globe reporter asked the insurer about it, even
though the payment was made last year. ``Yes, I wonder about'' the
timing, Wells said.
</P>
<P>
   Lund's profile was taken off line Tuesday, for about three
weeks, while that information is added and double-checked with the
physician, Wells said.

DUST SETTLING ON MARINERS _ AND IT'S ONLY APRIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Outside the Kingdome Tuesday night, a vaguely valiant
effort was waged to make it seem like baseball matters.
</P>
<P>
   Gutsy vendors sold their peanuts, pizza, Cracker Jack and other
necessities. Nerds, Sour Patch Kids and Red Vines. One culinary
innovator was even hawking Mariner theme-dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Wait until Major League Baseball Properties, or Alex Rodriguez's
bulldog agent, finds out about this. Along with these
quasi-appetizing pups, we can smell a lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, an A-Rod Dog (all beef) was going for $3, a Buhner Dog
(Polish sausage) cost $3.50, and a Griffey Dog (top dog at a
half-pound of alleged all beef) was going for $4.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem was you had to like your dog coated in dust.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, dust.
</P>
<P>
   Clouds of the stuff wafted through the chilly April air _ a
reminder that construction is under way in this neighborhood of
megabucks sports palaces.
</P>
<P>
   The Kingdome's south parking lot is gone. Springing up from the
rubble, cement pipes and dirt is the new exhibition center, which
explains the forklifts and bulldozers and half-ton trucks.
</P>
<P>
   It also explains why parking a car _ or worse, an SUV _ in
Pioneer Square has now become nearly as rare and prohibitive as
buying a house within city limits.
</P>
<P>
   Those precious swatches of asphalt are suddenly going for $20 a
pop, and office workers in Pioneer Square are actually being told
to vacate their monthly lots by 6 p.m. on game days since those
spaces have been sold out from under them.
</P>
<P>
   What will Bill Gates think of this, since some of his people are
actually being forced to go home in time for dinner?
</P>
<P>
   All said, conditions are not ripe for fan-friendly, feel-good
baseball. Indeed, this season the air is filled not with the sound
of hyper-excited fans filing down in samba-happy droves, a la 1995,
but of diesel engines, jackhammers, cement mixers and police
whistles making traffic snake and snarl.
</P>
<P>
   Also under construction is Mariner fan enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe it's in hibernation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just doesn't feel like baseball weather,'' one diehard
Mariner fan said as he headed for the Kingdome Tuesday _ Day 2 of a
strange, new season.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariner organization is attempting to ward off more red ink
in anticipation of the sold out grand opening of Safeco Field. In
the meantime, what are we to make of these unpromising months left
at the Kingdome?
</P>
<P>
   Not much, if you looked around Tuesday night at the lack of
people, lack of hubbub, lack of energy.
</P>
<P>
   After Monday brought the smallest opening night crowd in 13
seasons, a mere 20,435 turned out Tuesday to watch the Mariners
lose again to the White Sox, 11-3.
</P>
<P>
   An occasional polite applause broke the silence, like a tennis
crowd, until Jamie Moyer started giving up homers and walks, and
then orneriness set in.
</P>
<P>
   More likely than hibernation though is that Mariner fans are in
suspended animation. They don't know what to think. The peripheral
fans are still numb from last season, and there doesn't seem much
reason to head back to the old ballgame now, not with the M's
sporting six rookie pitchers and the Kingdome offering its final,
mostly futile days of existence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I hear them talking about most is whether they're
going to be able to sign Alex and Griffey,'' Rick ``The Peanut
Man'' Kaminski said Tuesday after surveying spring training and two
nights back on the beat at the Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   ``And they're wondering whether or not, once the new ballpark is
open, will the team decide there still isn't enough revenue and
they'll have to get rid of players to get a payroll they can
afford.''
</P>
<P>
   It is strange that a city like Seattle, with the world's most
expensive new ballpark ready to roll and a fan base that proved in
1995 it could turn electric, does not know whether the owners of
its baseball team are prepared to hang tough with baseball expenses
or on the verge of panic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think fans are taking a wait-and-see attitude,'' said
Mariner season ticket-holders David and Patty Arnold of
Woodinville.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to see if the team can re-sign Alex and Junior, and
since costs are going up (at the new ballpark and in the free agent
market), I think the Mariners are trying to figure out what they
can afford.''
</P>
<P>
   Lifelong fans like the Arnolds will show up these next three
months, no matter all the uncertainty. They didn't seem too peeved
that their ``secret little parking spot'' has gone from $10 to $15,
thanks to the squeeze on spaces.
</P>
<P>
   They said they really like new second baseman Carlos Guillen and
think the M's are worth watching, just as they believe the expense
and hassle of the new stadium are more than worth it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seattle is a huge metropolitan city. We're one of the premier
cities on the West Coast. If we had lost baseball again, like we
did with the Pilots, we would never get it back again,'' Patty
Arnold said.
</P>
<P>
   So what if, until July 15, we are sitting here in limbo,
pretending baseball matters.

SO HERE'S THE REAL Y2K PROBLEM
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY  
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I started in data processing in 1958. Y2K has
almost nothing to do with computer memory and everything to do with
storage media! If I keypunch a two-digit century on an 80-column
card, I have two fewer bytes to put ``real'' data in it. If I
include a two-digit century on a tape record (there were few disks
in the old days) that is written at 200 characters per inch, I can
waste a lot of tape! Please ask any of your fellow computerologists
who also spout this nonsense to correct this.
</P>
<P>
   _ All Huffy
</P>
<P>
   DEAR HUFFY: Ahhh, I see now. Programmers were either too lazy to
punch in another couple of bytes or too cheap to buy enough cards
and tape. And here everybody thought they were only incredibly
shortsighted. I'm sure this will give us all great comfort when
civilization falls completely apart in a few months and we're
living on roasted squirrel and shooting the neighbors because they
have the only operational can opener on the block.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I have a problem with attempting to boot up my
system from the hard drive. The following message appears when the
attempt is made: ``DISK I/O ERROR Replace the disk and then press
any key.'' Using ScanDisk from the emergency bootup floppy yields
the following message: ``ScanDisk encountered a data error while
reading the FAT entry for cluster 789725. This error prevents
ScanDisk from fixing this drive.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Bootless
</P>
<P>
   DEAR BOOTLESS: You are, to use a highly technical term,
goobered. Something has messed up your file allocation table, the
table of contents for your hard drive. Your PC can't find its
start-up files anymore. ScanDisk can sometimes fix this problem,
using a redundant FAT on the hard drive, but it's not a dead-solid
certainty.
</P>
<P>
   See if you can find somebody with a copy of Norton Disk Doctor,
which sometimes has better luck. Don't get your hopes up, though. A
screwy FAT is almost always a sign from above that it's time to
reformat the hard drive and start from scratch. At least you can
still boot from a floppy so you can try to rescue whatever data you
can.
</P>
<P>
   To reformat, first make yourself a very stiff cocktail. I
suggest something with a lot of rum and fruit juice, since a
tequila hangover will be much more intense. Now boot from the
emergency floppy and get to a DOS prompt. Type in FORMAT C: /S and
press Enter. You should have time to mix another cocktail while the
drive is formatted.
</P>
<P>
   When that's complete, run ScanDisk or Disk Doctor, sit back,
take a large sip of your drink and try not to put your eye out with
that little umbrella. Make sure you do a surface scan, which can
identify potential trouble spots on the disk and lock them off. Now
you get to load Windows and all your programs again. Won't that be
fun? Hint: Rum is cheaper by the liter.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: What does the word ``Pentium'' mean?
</P>
<P>
   _ Hegelian Etymologist
</P>
<P>
   DEAR HEGEL: It means, ``I may be the best marketing weasel at
Intel, but I still can't build a campaign around a chip with a
stupid name like `80586.'''
</P>
<P>
   (Noted computerologist Dr. Emilio Bombay wanted to call the
80586 ``Layla'' but Intel couldn't get the rights to the song. He

Abilene Project produces next Internet generation 
By Ernest Holsendolph  
c. 1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If the Internet, sometimes called the information
superhighway, could be compared to the swift Interstate highway
system, Internet 2 is like a space launch. Dedicated mostly to
education and research, it is superfast. No Sunday afternoon
drivers allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Called the Abilene Project, this second Internet started much
like the first, mostly by a consortium of schools _ in this
instance a roster of some 37 universities, as diverse and widely
separated as Georgia Tech, the University of Washington, Harvard
and the South Dakota School of Mines.
</P>
<P>
   It is also assisted by the expertise and equipment of private
businesses like Qwest Communications, Cisco Systems, and Nortel
Networks.
</P>
<P>
   While the speed of e-mail and surfing on the Internet can be
impressive, this system, bolstered by banks of supercomputers, is
beyond compare with networks commonly in use. Gordon D. Wishon,
Tech information technology staff specialist, describes it:
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's Internet, even at its fastest, will not support
important research and education applications, such as remote
manipulation of scientific instruments and storage and transmission
of massive experimental data sets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Practical application of digital video, such as telesurgery,
will not be possible without the capabilities Internet 2 will
provide ... at speeds initially equivalent to 600 times as fast as
current (and relatively fast) T1-based networks.''
</P>
<P>
   T1 networks are commonly used now by business and other special
commercial operators for the high-speed transmission of data.
</P>
<P>
   Wishon and others add the new superfast networks will have
better quality, as well as speed.
</P>
<P>
   The hallmark of the new network has been cooperation among
universities that often compete for talent and prestige, and
between the educational community and the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   In this region specifically, an agreement back in 1997 between
Georgia and North Carolina laid some groundwork for the larger
system. The two states connected their two high-speed networks,
thereby establishing communication among universities in both
states.
</P>
<P>
   Then, last year, universities in Georgia banded together to
produce something called the Southern Crossroads GigaPop, serving
institutions in this state as well as Florida and Alabama, filling
in the larger system now known as Internet 2.
</P>
<P>
   For the technical minded, the Abilene backbone spans more than
10,000 miles and operates at 2.4 gigabits per second _ that's
45,000 times faster than the familiar 56k bps modem employed in
many personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   The system will be far-reaching by the end of this year,
possibly comprising a network connecting more than 70
</P>
<P>
   institutions of higher learning and research centers.
</P>
<P>
   Here is what the private partners have contributed: Qwest has
provided its special advanced fiber optic network and engineering
support. Cisco has contributed high-speed communications equipment
that facilitates the integration of data, voice and video, as well
as engineering support for 11 nodes or intersections of the system.
And Nortel has provided its expertise in networking, as well as
optical networking.
</P>
<P>
   The organization guiding the development of the Abilene Project
is the University Corporation for Advanced Internet
</P>
<P>
   Development (UCAID), headed by Douglas E. Van Houweling,
president and CEO.
</P>
<P>
   ``The remarkable collaboration among the partners has provided
Internet 2 members with unsurpassed networking capabilities,'' he
said, and the benefit of this communication will pour forth through
the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Where we are concerned here in Georgia, the Internet 2 network
is providing a communications equivalent of the air and ground
transportation network. And just as the transportation hub has
spurred economic growth in this century, the communications hub
could be pivotal in the next century.

COMPANY MARKETS ELECTRICITY THROUGH INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By WENDY TANAKA   
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Internet has become a marketplace for
clothing, books, software and countless other consumer goods.
</P>
<P>
   Now a California company is selling electrical service over the
World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   The Albany-based company, utility.com, is trying to carve a
niche for itself in California's $20 billion electricity market,
which was opened to competition a year ago so customers could have
a wider choice of energy providers.
</P>
<P>
   Customers don't actually receive electricity over their phone
lines. Rather, it markets, offers sign-up and billing through the
Internet, matching customers with power sources offering the lowest
rates. Those energy suppliers then transport electricity over power
grids, which are owned and operated by utilities such as the
Pacific Gas and Electric Co.
</P>
<P>
   Chris King, chief executive of the company, said that on
average, his customers can save about 10 percent each month over
what they would pay to traditional electricity providers.
</P>
<P>
   King said utility.com offered better discounts than other energy
providers.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, residential customers have been able to save only
about 1 percent on (electricity) bills after switching suppliers,''
he said, referring to data from the state Public Utilities
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Utility.com can offer lower rates for two reasons. First, King
said, the company doesn't have high administrative costs since its
services are automated on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a call center or have to process bills on
paper,'' King said. ``We use the Internet for all our customer
services, which includes signing up for the service and bill
payment.''
</P>
<P>
   Utility.com customers receive their bills by electronic mail.
They also choose the date they get billed.
</P>
<P>
   Secondly, King said the company used special meters and
thermostats to track the exact time of day customers use power.
</P>
<P>
   This is important, he said, for creating precise bills since
electricity rates fluctuate during the day and are separated into
peak and off-peak prices.
</P>
<P>
   King said traditional utilities don't have these technologies,
so they estimate bill charges using an averaged rate.
</P>
<P>
   But the meters and thermostats that utility.com uses aren't free
to customers. The company charges $3.99 per month for them.
</P>
<P>
   Utility.com wouldn't disclose the number of customers it has,
but the company expects to have at least 50,000 by the end of the
year. The company also plans to start selling electricity to
customers in Pennsylvania, Massachusetts and Rhode Island this
summer. By next year, utility.com also hopes to be doing business
in Arizona, Nevada, New Jersey and New York.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts were skeptical about utility.com's chances because one
year after deregulation, few California customers have left the
traditional utilities.
</P>
<P>
   According to PUC data, only about 1 percent of the state's 10
million customers have switched to another energy provider.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deregulation is happening slowly in California,'' said Abhi
Chaki, an analyst at Jupiter Communications, a technology research
firm in New York. ``It's a combination of customer inertia and the
fact that electricity usage doesn't touch people in the same way
that, say, telephone service does.''
</P>
<P>
   Chaki said customers physically have to dial a phone, and this
makes them aware of the service. By contrast, he said, electric
service is less tangible.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Chaki said electric competition could ignite in
the future. ``Two years from now we might see more competition and
switching,'' he said.

RAYTHEON SUIT SPURS CALL FOR ON-LINE PRIVACY RULES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By ROSS KERBER   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Internet service providers such as America Online and Microsoft
Corp. offer strict assurances they will protect the privacy of your
personal information.
</P>
<P>
   Unless somebody asks to see it. Then things might change.
</P>
<P>
   That seems to be the lesson emerging from a lawsuit filed by
Raytheon Co. against 21 workers the defense contractor claims
posted private company information on a message board run by Yahoo
Inc. on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon didn't know any more than the screen-names of the
message posters when it filed the suit in February in Middlesex
(Mass.) Superior Court, seeking damages of more than $25,000 from a
group of defendants it calls ``John Does.''
</P>
<P>
   But Yahoo provided at least some basic information, allowing the
Lexington, Mass. defense contractor to gain motions demanding
further discovery from AOL, Microsoft, and others as it tries to
identify the chat-board users. Since then at least two Raytheon
employees have left the company, apparently as a result of the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, Raytheon says the postings caused ``harm to
its business reputation,'' citing messages in which employees
griped about the company's new chief executive, Daniel Burnham, its
earnings outlook, and controls at a plant in Andover, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Several of those targeted by Raytheon deny the charges. Also,
they say, they are upset at Yahoo, the California-based Internet
portal. Yahoo says it was following its guidelines, but a few users
say they expected a heads-up when Raytheon came knocking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe I'm guilty'' of disclosing trade secrets, said
one former Raytheon employee being sued. ``But I have that feeling
that somebody's after me for something I didn't do.''
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon's demands are among the most extensive to date as
companies try to clamp down on chat about them on-line. These cases
_ and Raytheon's in particular _ also point up the differences in
the protections that the nation's largest Internet providers afford
their users.
</P>
<P>
   That's a sore subject among privacy advocates, who want stricter
federal rules to clarify what they call a hodgepodge of practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many of these companies have very easy procedures for
lifting the anonymity of their users,'' said David Sobel, general
counsel for the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a
Washington, D.C., advocacy group. ``It really creates a chilling
effect on people who want to use the Internet in the way they've
become used to using it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the recent demands for personal data stem from the
growth of forums on the World Wide Web devoted to company news. In
an ongoing suit, for example, Oregon-based Itex Corp. last year
obtained from Yahoo the identities of several users the company
claims made defamatory statements about it.
</P>
<P>
   But complaints about their disclosures put service providers in
a bind, says Jonathan Osder, an attorney at Donahue Gallagher Woods
&AMP; Wood in Oakland., Calif., whose firm represents several Internet
service providers, or ISPs. ``The ISPs are trying on the one hand
to make people be at ease,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But on the other hand, they're saying that if you hit us with
a subpoena, we won't want to be a part of this,'' Osder said.
Fighting disclosures costs money, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   America Online, for example, promises its members in an on-line
policy statement that ``We do not give out your telephone number,
credit card information, or screen names unless you authorize us to
do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Click through to the fine print, however, and AOL adds that it
might do so in some cases ``to comply with valid legal process.''
Usually that means giving customers 14 days to file a challenge to
a demand for information, a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp., whose MSN unit also provides access to the
Internet, says the company also usually notifies customers before
surrendering data to outsiders in civil cases. But the software
giant says nothing in writing. ``We deal with these things on an
individual basis,'' said the spokesman, Tom Pilla.
</P>
<P>
   Last month Raytheon won two motions to seek discovery against
Microsoft and one of its units, Hotmail. Pilla said neither has
received any demands from Raytheon yet.
</P>
<P>
   On its own Website, Yahoo states that: ``Yahoo is committed to
safeguarding your privacy on line.'' But the policy also says: ``As
a general rule, Yahoo will not disclose any of your personally
identifiable information except when we have your permission or
under special circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith
that the law requires it . . .''
</P>
<P>
   To several of the people being sued by Raytheon, that language
implied Yahoo could have alerted them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reading their disclosure, it said they would keep this
information confidential,'' said the former Raytheon employee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see no problem with them (Yahoo) releasing it, if I'm told
beforehand,'' the former employee said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Yahoo nor Raytheon executives have contacted him
regarding his postings, this person said, adding he learned of the
lawsuit from chat about it on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Another person being sued by Raytheon, who uses the screen name
of ``Winstoncar,'' also wanted Yahoo to protect the information.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like their policy of turning over our names,''
Winstoncar wrote on the chat board on Saturday. ``The message board
states that Raytheon is not connected with it, and we may share
information with others. That's what I did. Bad choice!''
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo spokeswoman Diane Hunt said the John Does should have read
the company's policies more carefully. Under those terms, she said,
``We believe that we were already notifying them in advance'' that
the company would answer demands like Raytheon's.
</P>
<P>
   Hunt declined to discuss what information, if any, the company
has passed along. But other people familiar with the matter say
Yahoo turned over much of what it knew about the users. In some
cases that included only e-mail addresses linked to other accounts
on AOL, Microsoft, and others. Now Raytheon is using that data to
demand more specifics from the ISPs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can think of it as, just how many doors are you going to
step through?'' said one person close to the case.
</P>
<P>
   So far just one of the John Does has publicly identified
himself: Steve MacKenzie, an engineer at Raytheon's Andover
facility who goes by the Yahoo screen name of ``RaytheonVeteran.''
He said he learned of the suit from newspaper accounts.
</P>
<P>
   MacKenzie remains at his job in Andover. He declined to say
whether the company has taken any actions against him. Raytheon
says the suit against ``RaytheonVeteran'' remains in effect.
</P>
<P>
   In the suit, Raytheon alleged a message he posted on June 30
constituted ``disclosure of inside financial issues'' because it
described certain changes to the company's profit-sharing plans.
MacKenzie now says that he was only reporting information that was
about to be printed in a company newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   In a message on the Yahoo chat board on March 5, MacKenzie
wrote: ``My only regret is that Raytheon never made any attempt to
locate us using conventional means. Bulk e-mail for instance or
perhaps a short blurb in the company newsletter.''
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon spokeswoman Toni Simonetti said that MacKenzie and
other posters should have known better already, under existing
nondisclosure agreements.
</P>
<P>
   But after newspaper reports of the suit appeared in early March,
Raytheon sent around a general memo that was more specific about
employee use of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   According to the memo, ``It's always OK for employees to discuss
the company and its actions, and otherwise to air their thoughts
through the Internet. In these cases, the Internet is just an
electronic extension of the old-fashioned conversation at the water
cooler. However . . . please take extra care not to discuss company
proprietary information. That is never OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon declined to discuss its ongoing probe or whether it has
extended its search for other employees besides the 21 it has
already sued. Citing employee privacy, the company also declined to
comment on whether it has disciplined any. One of the Yahoo users
cited by the company, the one known as Winstoncar, reported on the
message board last week that ``as of today I no longer work for the
company.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Raytheon employees say this person and others deserved to
be punished for giving outsiders a look at internal matters. ``To
place the blame on Yahoo demonstrates an inability to accept
personal responsibility for your actions,'' wrote one poster who
uses the moniker ``Gearjammer47.''
</P>
<P>
   Others say Yahoo's actions have left the chat-room users
isolated _ the opposite of what they expected when they chose to
express their opinions anonymously. ``The irony is profound,'' said
one Raytheon employee, who often posts chat on the Yahoo message
board but isn't involved in the suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Raytheon knows who these people are, and their putative
friends don't,'' he said.

AN EARLY SEASON GUIDE TO TOP BASEBALL SITES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By TOMMY CUMMINGS  
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OK, so a look at the best major-league baseball sites might be a
day or two late. We're in agreement here.
</P>
<P>
   But, remember, it has been only a few days since entertainer
Garth Brooks was on the San Diego Padres' roster or actor Kevin
Costner was mishandling a big-league fly ball ... so it must not be
``that'' late for some serious baseball talk.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few early-season choices for the serious online
baseball fan:
</P>
<P>
   BEST OVERALL SITE: Fastball (www.fastball.com), produced by Cox
Interactive Media, is a very proactive site. It includes scores,
team-by-team updates, statistics, archives, interactivity,
fantasy-league help and information on minor leagues and
collectibles (lots of those bobbing-head players).
</P>
<P>
   And in case you're poring over all this stuff in the office
during working hours, the site even has a quick escape function _
the Boss! Button, which, at a click of a button, brings up a bogus
inventory report. Another off-best feature is the Foul Pole
section, which includes theme teams (such as the All-Body Parts
team) and always-a-hoot quotations from Casey Stengel and Yogi
Berra.
</P>
<P>
   BEST BIG-MEDIA SITE: It's tough to knock tradition; ``The
Sporting News'' has tracked baseball with detail, it seems, since
Abner Doubleday was playing T-ball. The St. Louis-based magazine
continues the tradition with an easy-to-navigate, content-rich site
(www.sportingnews.com/baseball). The Sporting News Online spreads
its reach on its MSNBC.com and America Online affiliations while
blanketing pro baseball with its vast network of correspondents.
</P>
<P>
   BEST GADGET: Hands down, the best gizmo on any baseball site is
Total Baseball's TotalCast (www.totalbaseball.com), which
replicates action from the real baseball field. Tiny electronic
players (note: they're physically incorrect, so none have oversized
Mark McGwire arms) reach base on a screen-sized field as
pitch-by-pitch charts are automatically updated every few seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Other interesting stops:
</P>
<P>
   BEST SITE ABOUT BALLPARKS: Ballparks by Munsey and Suppes
(www.ballparks.com/baseball) puts users in selected baseball
stadiums and parks with images, seating charts and historical data.
You can almost smell the hot dogs.
</P>
<P>
   BEST COLLECTION OF LINKS: John Skilton's Baseball Links
(www.baseball-links.com) is the standard. Skilton, a Swanwyck,
Del., baseball fan, has compiled, as of yesterday, 4,783 unique
links about baseball.
</P>
<P>
   BEST ALBERT BELLE NEWS: Hofstetter's Baseball Jerk of the Week
(www.jerkoftheweek.com/baseball), created by John and Steve
Hofstetter of New York, highlights the league's most embarrassing
representative each week.
</P>
<P>
   BEST MULTIMEDIA: Somewhere Major League Baseball's official site
(www.majorleaguebaseball.com) has to fit into the mix, and here it
does. The site's redeeming value is its exclusive audio and video
content. Overall, however, it's not much more than a site of
record.
</P>
<P>
   BEST INTERACTIVITY: Bigleaguers.com (www.bigleaguers.com) has a
page for ``every'' player in the big leagues. It also has chat
sessions, player diaries and interactive games.
</P>
<P>
   BEST HISTORICAL DATA: CNNSI.com's Historical Profiles section
(www.cnnsi.com/baseball/mlb/historical_profiles) includes rosters,
facts and career statistics of players from 1871-1996.
</P>
<P>
   BEST PLACE TO HEAR A GAME ONLINE: Duh. Broadcast.com
(www.broadcast.com/sports/baseball). The Dallas-based site includes
daily listings of games to be audiocast and archives of the weekly
news conferences by players. BYTES
</P>
<P>
   WEB MASTERS: The Masters Tournament is usually CNNSI.com's time
to shine. CNNSI.com will team with ``The Augusta'' (Ga.)
``Chronicle'' to provide real-time leader boards; player-by-player,
hole-by-hole scorecards; virtual-reality tours of the Augusta
National course; and lots of updates, multimedia, interactivity and
history. The tournament is scheduled to begin Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   CLEAR FORECAST: ESPN.com calls its 400,000 registrants for its
NCAA men's tournament interactive contest the largest of its kind
on the Internet. The winner was Sgt. Robert Segreti, a weather
forecaster at Vance Air Force Base in Enid, Okla., who correctly
predicted 46 of the 63 games in the NCAA men's tournament. Segreti
correctly predicted the tournament's final eight.
</P>
<P>
   POLL OF THE WEEK: It might work with NASCAR, but not with
baseball. Of 46,692 respondents, 94.7 percent (44,245) do not like
the idea of Major League Baseball putting ads on uniforms.

HOW INTERNET MANIA COULD BRING PILOTS' UNION TO HEEL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is no doubt that Internet companies can create tremendous
wealth overnight, but can the current Internet mania by investors
help management bring a labor union to heel?
</P>
<P>
   It may be a testament to Wall Street's current faith in the
omnipotence of the World Wide Web that some people are convinced it
can _ at least in the case of AMR Corp., the parent of American
Airlines, which is currently at war with its pilots.
</P>
<P>
   The idea comes in the aftermath of last week's initial public
offering of Priceline.com, which allows customers to name their own
price for airplane tickets on the Web. After less than a year in
business, during which it lost $114 million selling $35 million
worth of airline tickets, Priceline.com is valued at $10 billion,
more than the combined worth of UAL's United Airlines, Northwest
Airlines and Continental Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to American, AMR owns the Sabre Group, an
information technology company that in turn owns Travelocity, which
is the leading seller of airplane tickets over the Web. It too lost
money last year but it sold $285 million worth of airline tickets,
hotel rooms and rental cars. Depending on whom you believe,
Travelocity on its own could be worth _ pick a number _ $1 billion,
$5 billion or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best way to get at the value of Travelocity is for AMR to
divest Sabre,'' said Kevin Murphy, an analyst at Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter. ``One of the byproducts of that is that the airline
gets isolated. And if the airline is out there by itself, you would
see the poor return on investment and the lousy operating margins.
The market would force discipline on the management and then on the
union.''
</P>
<P>
   That discipline, he added, would help AMR management convince
the pilots _ as well as its other unions _ that the company cannot
afford to concede too much. ``Right now there is an intangible
situation where the airline gets refuge under the Sabre umbrella,''
Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   AMR, which currently owns 82 percent of Sabre, would not comment
on whether it plans to spin off the rest of the company. But the
move may be hard to resist.
</P>
<P>
   Since Priceline.com began trading last week, Sabre's stock price
has soared 32 percent, or $14.375 a share, closing Tuesday at $58 a
share, up $3. Likewise, AMR stock, which had suffered in recent
weeks after a Feb. protest by its pilots forced it to cancel nearly
6,700 flights, has risen sharply as well. Tuesday it closed at
$65.6875, up $1.0625, and it has increased 16 percent since last
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes the marketplace leads management's strategic
thinking,'' Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Tuesday, Michael Durham, Sabre's chief
executive, would not say whether Sabre would spin off Travelocity
but he was relishing the temptation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an old finance guy,'' said Durham, who was formerly AMR's
chief financial officer. ``If somebody tells me that I can get $10
billion for a company that is losing money, it sort of feels like
you might want to be a seller.''
</P>
<P>
   But he quickly added that separating Travelocity from Sabre
would remove many of the important benefits that it gets from
Sabre's other businesses. The company, which had $2.3 billion in
revenue last year, operates the world's largest airline computer
reservation system and has a large information-technology
consulting business. Whenever Sabre's software designers come up
with a new feature for the services it offers travel agents and
corporations, it can also add the same functionality to
Travelocity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously there is a tremendous frenzy in the marketplace
right now,'' Durham said. ``But our shareholders and board of
directors have put us here to optimize the long-term value of
Sabre.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the longer the Internet frenzy lasts, the more AMR appears
to be tugged in two different directions. Sabre now trades at about
30 times expected 1998 earnings, while AMR without Sabre might
trade at about five times earnings. Without the speculation of a
spinoff, Sabre's share price would certainly fall. (It traded as
low as $23 a share last year).
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are only getting an airline multiple for Sabre
earnings, you are hurting shareholders,'' said Samuel Buttrick, an
analyst at Paine Webber in New York.
</P>
<P>
   That is exactly why Murphy believes that a Sabre spinoff
ultimately would force American's unions to bend by isolating the
airline. But the pilots see things differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that is probably a counterproductive strategy,'' said
Brian Mayhew, vice president of the Allied Pilots Association, the
American pilots' union. ``I don't think that because they spin off
Sabre tomorrow our professional worth is less.''
</P>
<P>
   The pilots and AMR management are in mediation this week in an
attempt to settle a dispute over AMR's purchase of Reno Air, a
small carrier in the West. American's pilots were so upset with the
company for what they say are a series of deliberate contract
violations that when negotiations broke down in early February over
how to merge Reno into American's network, thousands of pilots
called in sick, stranding hundreds of thousands of passengers.
</P>
<P>
   John Pincavage, an airline analyst at Warburg Dillon Read, said
that the unions did not care that airlines were not as profitable
as Internet companies; they just see four consecutive years of
record profits, not the low fuel prices and travel agent commission
cuts that have sustained them.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the airlines making the kind of money they are making,
the unions wouldn't buy that,'' he said, referring to the market
discipline described by Murphy. ``All they know is that they gave
in the past and they are not seeing their paychecks go up.''

Net brings depth to Kosovo issues 
By Frances Katz  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For a generation used to wars and international
conflicts that start on Friday and are over by Sunday and broadcast
live or at least in part by CNN or ``Nightline,'' NATO's air
strikes in the Balkan province of Kosovo are bewildering.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Iraq, Iran or even the former Soviet Union, the names and
nationalities of the players in the Balkan drama are unfamiliar to
many Americans. Just as TV can bring graphic depictions of war and
its aftermath to people around the world, the Internet can provide
breadth and depth of content impossible to find anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot of talk about community on the Net, but the
international community that has formed around this issue is
something Web surfers should take advantage of.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of personal feelings about NATO, Kosovo or the
Serbian government, the Web provides the opportunity for an
exchange of views and information that can't be found anywhere
else. There are many sites that can help you understand the
geography and the nature of the conflict, and they are worth
checking out. But after that, why not go a bit deeper and listen to
the voices, American, British, Serbian and Albanian, sharing their
thoughts, feelings and strongly held opinions?
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think the Internet is so appropriate now because there is
a general lack of knowledge. The geography is certainly an issue as
well, as well as the nationalities involved,'' says Katherine
Dillon, ABCNews.com's vice president and general manager.
</P>
<P>
   ABCNews.com features a special section on its Web site called
``Balkans for Beginners,'' which provides maps, time lines and
other background to help readers understand where the fighting is
and who the participants are.
</P>
<P>
   It's an excellent geography and history lesson and a good
jumping-off point for anyone attempting to understand the conflict.
The Web site is one of the best there is for breaking complicated
news stories down to basics without talking down to or over the
heads of its readers.
</P>
<P>
   ABC, CNN and MSNBC report large numbers of postings to message
boards from national and international users. CNN has also set up a
special message board for Balkans residents only, but doesn't vouch
for the validity of the posts. ABCNews.com says it has received
more than 13,000 posts on the subject in just over a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very emotional story,'' says Dillon. ``People are
opinionated, and they are angry. Nobody seems to be wishy-washy on
this. We've never seen the flood of reaction. We are amazed how
focused and informed and intelligent these boards are.''
</P>
<P>
   British Broadcasting Co.
(news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/specialreport/1998/kosovo/), considered
by some to be the finest news organization in the world, offers an
international perspective on the crisis. A RealAudio clip of the
BBC World Service featuring the BBC's John Humphreys in a heated
argument with Milodrag Popovic, deputy information minister in
Belgrade, winds up in a near shouting match that's nothing like the
staid impartiality of the BBC's World Service radio broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still in tears for the millions of people who have lost
their lives and their homes in Kosovo,'' Humphreys nearly screams,
as Popovic maintains the genocide _ if there is any genocide _
didn't begin until NATO began bombing. ``Why did you call me if you
don't want to listen to me?'' Popovic shouts.
</P>
<P>
   The BBC also offers an interactive guide to the Kosovo crisis at
news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/natointeract/nsinteract.html,
which includes an area called talking points, where users can post
opinions and responses.
</P>
<P>
   The BBC has highlighted two comments that illustrate the
complexity of the situation. A Kosovo Albanian writes: ``NATO, we
were waiting for this day to bomb Serbian terrorists. We love you
Nato.'' From the other side, a Belgrade resident writes: ``NATO
please stop your bombs it is not our fault. We are not Slobodan
Milosevic.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, on CNN, one reader wrote to another: ``Again, what
evidence there is seems to dispute your version of events, or at
least your sources' version. What is NOT in dispute are the tens of
thousands of refugees being created in Kosovo by Milosevic and his
henchmen. This forced exodus is a human disaster of epic
proportions not seen since WWII.''
</P>
<P>
   While the BCC and others continue to cover the war and engage
its participants, there is no longer any news from Belgrade radio
station B92 (www.b92.net). The posting on the Web site says the
station was shut down on Good Friday by inspectors, policemen fired
the station's director and a court appointed a new director who
will take over on Monday. The signoff reads: ``The struggle
continues. We shall never surrender. Radio B92, Belgrade, Serbia.''
</P>
<P>
   The B92 site uses RealAudio to replay the chilling sound of an
air-raid siren that lasts for what seems like hours but is in
reality a few seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Even from the comfort of your den, in front of your computer
with perhaps the TV or a favorite CD playing in the background, the
Balkan war seems to come right into your living room. And when it
does, it gets harder not to become just a little bit smarter and
just a little bit more interested in events taking place half a
world away.

Backups simplify desktop brain surgery 
By Gerry Yandel  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Yea, though I walk through the valley of Win95, I fear
no evil ... for I have backed up system.dat and user.dat.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing like the threat of totally annihilating your
operating system to add a little edge to customizing your computer
and the way it works.
</P>
<P>
   So when you go rooting around in the Windows registry, you're
walking about as close to that edge as you can (without having to
reinstall). I was lucky the first time I went stumbling through the
confusing directory tree of HKEYs. I blithely clicked hither and
yon, not a care in the world, not a backup in sight.
</P>
<P>
   I actually messed up the registry enough that I couldn't boot
into Windows and had to use a special feature of Win95, detailed
below, to restore my system.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, well, we're all newbies once.
</P>
<P>
   I've since been fiddling in the registry with a little more
awareness, and it's quite a powerful little database. It stores all
the configuration information and settings for the operating
system, whether it's Win 95, 98 or NT.
</P>
<P>
   You can use it to remove those ugly little arrows at the bottom
of shortcut icons, clean out the add/delete programs list in your
control panel or bury dead file types from old programs. You can
also use it to fine-tune Windows to make your hardware run more
smoothly. It came to the rescue when I moved Office 97 onto a new
hard drive and the program suddenly couldn't find its own
templates.
</P>
<P>
   Windows takes some of the thrill out of doing desktop brain
surgery by automatically creating backups of system.dat and
user.dat in files called system.da0 and user.da0 every time your
operating system successfully boots. (That's helpful because
Microsoft doesn't support hacking the registry, and any attempts to
get their tech support to help fix one you've messed up will
probably not yield decent _ if any _ results.)
</P>
<P>
   System.dat and user.dat are hidden files, so open Windows
Explorer and go to file types under ``view'' and change it to
``show all'' if you can't find them.
</P>
<P>
   You can make your own copies in addition to the auto backups (a
good idea). There's also a Microsoft backup program called
cfgback.exe available on some Win95 CDs in the
(backslash)Other(backslash)Misc(backslash)Cfgback directory _ and
the sites listed below _ that makes multiple backups. Now you're
ready to open regedit.exe, which is in the Windows directory.
Regedit is simply a utility that allows you to see the registry
database as a directory tree, similar to the Windows Explorer. It
also allows you to search the registry with relative ease and avoid
printing the registry out _ which can easily run to more than 1,000
pages. Instead, we'll open regedit, and we find the infamous HKEYS:
</P>
<P>
   HKEYUSERS
</P>
<P>
   HKEYLOCALMACHINE
</P>
<P>
   HKEYCLASSESROOT
</P>
<P>
   HKEYCURRENTUSER
</P>
<P>
   HKEYCURRENTCONFIG
</P>
<P>
   HKEYDYNDATA
</P>
<P>
   The first two are the primary branches, with USERS storing the
preferences for the different users, and LOCALMACHINE keeping track
of the hardware configuration and the software file types. The next
three HKEYs are actually places to store information while the
system is in use, with CLASSESROOT being a mirror of the software
settings under HKEYLOCAL
</P>
<P>
   MACHINE/SOFTWARE/Classes. The last one, HKEYDYNDATA, keeps track
of plug-and-play devices and changes as they are added or removed.
</P>
<P>
   The actual keys are stored inside the HKEYs as subdirectories,
sometimes several layers into the directory tree, and appear as
folders holding one or several icons. Each icon represents a data
type and has a value written as either a string of text, binary
data (as a hexadecimal) or dword data (also as hexadecimal).
</P>
<P>
   So what does all this mean? These values are where you can do
your most stunning _ or devastating _ work on your system. For
instance, when Office 97 somehow lost track of its templates (never
mind that they were sitting right in the Office subdirectory), the
fix was simple and quick. I opened regedit and, after doing a few
searches, I was able to find several values that pointed to the old
hard drive path. Simply changing the drive letter in the
appropriate values made everything run smoothly again.
</P>
<P>
   When my video capture card and NetMeeting weren't getting along,
the fix was even easier. On the card manufacturer's tech support
Web page, I found the answer to my specific situation, which merely
involved finding one key in the registry and changing three values
slightly. Voila! These fixes were mere parlor tricks, though,
compared with what a little reverse engineering on the registry can
accomplish.

Splurge at buythebest.com 
By Mark Clothier  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Are you in the market for a $2.5 million,
single-engine turboprop but just don't have the time to shop?
</P>
<P>
   A Web site, www.buythebest.com, might be worth checking out. The
site is devoted to the real expensive and mildly practical. Think
of it as Robin Leach meets Sharper Image. It's the type of site
where Bill Gates could find something nice and little for fellow
Microsoft founder and billionaire Paul Allen.
</P>
<P>
   You can't actually buy a plane from the site. If you are
interested in the Pilatus PC-12, you can fill out a form and a
Pilatus dealer will contact you.
</P>
<P>
   There are more-affordable items, relatively speaking, as well.
An ergonomic chair sells for $1,070. A titanium-frame bike is
peddled for $6,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site targets the consumer searching for state-of-the-art
stuff. Products include a $580 briefcase, an $85,000 Hummer and a
$12,000 jukebox.
</P>
<P>
   The site features more than 20 products. Included are product
pictures, information, descriptions and reviews.
</P>
<P>
   Buythebest.com, the catalog for connoisseurs, is based in St.
Louis.
</P>
<P>
   An online Easter
</P>
<P>
   A new Web site lets you make a virtual pilgrimage to the Holy
Land, just in time for Easter Sunday. The site,
virtualholyland.com, seeks to be a portal for all things Middle
East. The start page offers weather reports for Jerusalem and
Galilee and 24-hour news updates from the Holy Land.
</P>
<P>
   It has a host of Middle East-themed features, including the
Holycam, a camera focused on Jerusalem's Western Wall; a free
e-mail account, zionmail.com; a scrolling breaking-news ticker; and
Holy Land-themed chat rooms and forums.
</P>
<P>
   The site lets visitors observe a traditional Passover seder, the
meal Jesus ate the night before he died. The site also features a
video tour of Calvary, including the skull-faced hill that some
believe to overlook the site of Jesus' death and the Garden Tomb, a
hand-carved grave said to be where his body lay for three days
between Good Friday and Easter Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   This morning, the site will transmit the radio broadcast of two
Easter services from Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The site, launched in December, includes travel tips, a Kid's
Club and an online Bible.
</P>
<P>
   Online arts connection
</P>
<P>
   In its race to be a mass medium like television, the Web already
has the commercial and low-brow departments covered. But it also
will need more culture.
</P>
<P>
   A site at www.culturefinder.com/ hopes to add some. The site
claims arts listings for more than 1,000 cities. Detailed
information is given for larger cities. Atlanta, Dallas, Houston,
Miami and Minneapolis are on that list, which also includes Boston,
Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, Philadelphia, San Francisco and
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The site offers information about plays, classical music
concerts, opera, visual arts, dance and film.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to the site can search by state or by arts
organization, date or venue. They can also check museum listings
for certain museums. The only museum listing for Georgia is the
High Museum of Art, in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   You can also add your e-mail address to the free weekly e-mail
newsletter. In its January issue, Yahoo! Internet Life magazine
rated CultureFinder.com the Internet's best cultural directory.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
Updated anti-virus program has become a necessity 
By Bill Husted  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I remember years ago writing a column that said
computer virus fears were overblown. I said the chances of getting
hit by a virus were about the same as a meteor hitting you while
driving along Interstate 285.
</P>
<P>
   Well, that advice was true at the time. But nowadays, the
Internet and the computer world are being bombarded regularly by
meteor showers when it comes to viruses and other malicious
programs designed to invade your privacy or destroy information on
your hard disk. The most recent example is ``Melissa,'' a tiny
stealth program that sneaks into your computer as an e-mail
attachment.
</P>
<P>
   You probably have read all you want to read about Melissa. She's
been one popular girl. And police in New Jersey arrested David L.
Smith, 30, Thursday night and charged him with being Melissa's
daddy. So I won't spend much time with her other than to tell you
if you still need to know how to defend yourself against that
particular virus, you can find all the information you need online.
One great site is located at www.zdnet.com.
</P>
<P>
   While Melissa is a danger, the really frightening news is the
me-too viruses all that publicity spawned. The creators of viruses
do it partially for the twisted joy of watching all the turmoil
they create. And we've already seen Melissa imitators such as Papa
that invade your computer using a spreadsheet attachment instead of
_ as in the case of Melissa _ a Microsoft Word document. Most
anti-virus software companies have created patches (tiny programs
that update an existing application) that allow their programs to
catch Melissa and Papa. Just check the Web site for your anti-virus
program.
</P>
<P>
   The new viruses are being created so fast that even the best
anti-virus software can't keep up. That's not to say you shouldn't
use anti-virus protection. Nowadays, you're just plain foolish if
you don't. But think of all the people _ including employees of
companies that have excellent security and anti-virus protection _
that suffered from Melissa before it was discovered. In a twisted
way, these folks were the pioneers who suffered the embarrassment
and inconvenience of learning sensitive Word documents of theirs
were being sent around the world by Melissa.
</P>
<P>
   So it's no longer good enough to simply rely on anti-virus
software. I'm not being hysterical when I say you are vulnerable to
a virus attack, no matter what you do. But there are some
precautions you can take _ especially in view of the latest fad of
invading the documents and data on your hard disk _ to lessen the
risk.
</P>
<P>
   First, get a good anti-virus program and make sure you update it
regularly. Once a week isn't too frequent.
</P>
<P>
   Next, simply refuse to open e-mail attachments, even if they
come from someone you know. As you'll recall, that's the trick
Melissa introduced, making it seem the e-mail came from someone you
know. If you receive an attachment, don't open it. Up to now _ and
things are changing so fast you can't count on this in the future _
all of these viruses and malevolent programs arrive in an
attachment. Plain old-fashioned e-mail is safe.
</P>
<P>
   If you have documents or e-mail that would be embarrassing or
could be used to invade your bank account or reveal other financial
information, you may want to consider keeping them on a ZIP drive
disk or a floppy disk. This is painful, since the whole idea of a
computer is convenience and storing sensitive documents elsewhere
takes time and is inefficient. But there's no other way I know to
protect this information.
</P>
<P>
   This is all depressing to a fellow like me. I've spent years and
years extolling the virtues of computers and the Internet. And now
I worry that, unless someone comes up with a way to increase
security, it's becoming a risky and even seamy place. I wish I
could offer reassurance. Instead, I offer my sympathy along with a
Web site that offers a free computer check for viruses:
www.mcaffee.com/.

 &HT;    Aaron pleased record ball is resting in Atlanta
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ One of the largest billboards at Turner Field
advertises something that isn't for sale. You've seen the slightly
yellowed baseball towering above the public entrance to the
ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't just any ball.
</P>
<P>
   It's the ball, historic home-run ball No. 715, which left Hank
Aaron's bat and sailed over the left-center field fence on April 8,
1974, to send Aaron past Babe Ruth in the record books. Atlanta
relief pitcher Tom House caught it and returned it to Aaron, who
believes that if it had gone into the stands, someone would have
gotten hurt. He has it on loan to the Braves museum.
</P>
<P>
   But while the slugger always kept this ball safe and close, for
22 years he was annoyed that he could not retrieve his final home
run ball, No. 755. Aaron still doesn't have it, but he is pleased
that a Milwaukee Brewers groundskeeper, who was fired after
catching the ball and leaving the clubhouse with it, no longer has
it, either.
</P>
<P>
   The ball quietly sold for $869,000 in a private deal in
September after failing to reach its reserve price in an auction.
The anonymous buyer, who lives in New Jersey, was a friend of one
of Aaron's friends. ``I know where it is now,'' Aaron said. ``I
know it's in good hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Aaron had been trying to get the ball away from Richard Arndt
since July 20, 1976, when no one knew that the homer out of County
Stadium would be his last.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't talk about it that much because I get angry about
it,'' Aaron said.
</P>
<P>
   Arndt claims that the Brewers would not arrange a meeting with
Aaron, but Aaron said that he met him and offered 12 autographed
balls as a trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, 'Let me think about it.''' Aaron recalled. ``I said,
'If you walk out of this clubhouse, don't talk to me.' So he walked
out, and the Brewers found out he had taken the ball out of the
clubhouse and fired him.''
</P>
<P>
   Aaron said Arndt called every five years or so. Aaron's sponsor,
Magnavox, offered to buy the ball, ``But just as anybody was
getting ready to make a deal, he'd draw it back.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Arndt again approached the Brewers. Bud Selig and his
daughter asked Aaron what he thought, and he said, ``Don't even
talk to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Aaron was further miffed that the ball was autographed: Arndt
attended a card show where Aaron _ who had no idea who he was _
signed the ball. ``That was sneaky,'' Aaron said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the ball was offered at an auction in September. Arndt
agreed to give Aaron's ``Chasing the Dream Foundation'' 42 percent
of the proceeds. But while bidding reached $800,000 for No. 755, it
didn't reach Arndt's asking price. So Aaron convinced his lawyer
and the wealthy friend to make a backroom deal. While he still
doesn't have control of the ball, Aaron said, ``I got it out of his
hands; that's the only thing I wanted to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y., would
love to have that ball, or No. 715, someday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have the ability to purchase,'' Hall of Fame
spokesman Jeff Idelson said.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron has donated home run balls 500, 600, 700 , 703, 704, 706,
709, 710, 714 and 717, as well as his 3,000th hit. He has also
contributed bats, gloves and apparel.
</P>
<P>
   But Aaron said No. 715 and the bat he swung belong in Atlanta,
where people can see them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit the home run here; the ball and bat are supposed to be
here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron said many years ago he was offered $1 million for the two.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing that I have that I've sold,'' he said. ``And I
never will.''

 &HT;    Hank Aaron's difficult chase
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Imagine what Hank Aaron's career would have been like
if he had been born 25 years later.
</P>
<P>
   He never would have spent the night in rooming houses while his
white teammates slept in a fancy hotels, never would have been
forced to play a road game by baseball's commissioner and never
would have received so much hate mail during ``The Chase.''
</P>
<P>
   He also never would have gotten a moment's peace from the media.
It would have been HankTV 24 hours a day. And, of course, with
present-day salaries, Aaron probably would have made enough money
to retire before reaching 715 home runs, let alone 755.
</P>
<P>
   In this 25th-anniversary season celebration, some aspects of
chasing Babe Ruth's record Aaron doesn't want to remember. Given a
second chance, he would rewrite the script from a quarter-century
ago. Only the ending would stay the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish all of it could have been done differently,'' said
Aaron, 65, now a Braves executive whose office overlooks Turner
Field. ``I would have made it like it was last year with (Mark)
McGwire and (Sammy) Sosa _ you know, a happy moment, going to the
ballpark, enjoying yourself, doing what you could do best.''
</P>
<P>
   He watched from afar as the St. Louis Cardinals' McGwire and the
Chicago Cubs' Sosa battled to be the first to break Roger Maris'
record of 61 home runs in a single season. He never offered them
advice; they couldn't have related to what he went through.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was happy for them; I was happy for baseball,'' said Aaron,
who made the big leagues in 1954 when Bobby Thomson broke an ankle
in spring training. ``It was the same way when Pete Rose was
chasing Ty Cobb's (career hits) record. He seemed to be enjoying
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Was Aaron envious? He replied cautiously, ``I think that I was
envious to the point that, yes, I wish it had been me.''
</P>
<P>
   For McGwire and Sosa, the legendary Ruth's record was
once-removed. They thrilled to the chase. Aaron endured it. Not
only was Aaron the first black man to make an assault on a record
held by a white man, but it also was the most prominent record in
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   And while McGwire and Sosa had two months of excitement, Aaron's
quest stretched out over the 1973 season and into 1974.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't the most happy time of my life, but yet it should
have been,'' Aaron said. ``You remember all these things, and part
of it kind of chips away at you a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Changes in society would grant Aaron greater acceptance today.
Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier in 1947, the year before
Ruth died. ``People were living in the Babe Ruth era; you have to
remember that,'' Aaron said. ``They were not ready to accept (black
players) yet. And here I come along challenging what was one of the
most hallowed, the most prestigious, the biggest record in all of
sport. And people were not about to turn that loose.
</P>
<P>
   ``You still had those diehard racist people who wanted to hold
onto that.''
</P>
<P>
   And they let him know.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron received more than 900,000 pieces of mail. Some of the
letters and postcards were dripping with hate, racial epithets and
death threats.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, McGwire has received an estimated 100,000 pieces
of mail. A Cardinals official said every piece that she had
inspected was congratulatory, and a good many wanted autographs.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta police assigned Calvin Wardlaw to protect Aaron. He
carried a .38 snub-nosed revolver in a binoculars case, but never
had to use it.
</P>
<P>
   The media was slower to pay attention to the man nicknamed ``Bad
Henry.'' ``It really didn't pick up until about August of '73 (when
he was at 702),'' said Frank Hyland, then The Atlanta Journal beat
writer. ``Then everybody slapped their head and said, 'This guy
might hit 715.'''
</P>
<P>
   Aaron knew how the media had hounded Maris in 1961, and he
wasn't about to let that happen to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were taking some of his hair out,'' Aaron said. ``I
wasn't going to buckle under to those guys. I was their last
choice: there was Mickey (Mantle), there was Willie (Mays), there
was Harmon Killebrew. I got to be the last choice. I was close to
breaking the record by the time they knew I was there.''
</P>
<P>
   Aaron hit home run No. 713 in the next-to-last game of the 1973
season. In the final game, he had three hits, enough to push his
batting average to .301, but no home runs. For six months, he
waited.
</P>
<P>
   At spring training, the media descended on Aaron. The 1974
season opened in Cincinnati exactly 25 years ago today.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very stressful time for him,'' said Ernie Johnson,
Braves announcer and former teammate. ``We all knew he was going to
do it; it was just a question of when he was going to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   When Aaron mentioned that he would sit out the series against
the Reds so he could hit the tying and go-ahead home runs in
Atlanta, commissioner Bowie Kuhn demanded that he play two of the
three games. Braves manager Eddie Mathews was furious but was
forced to comply or face sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that the commissioner would take an aggressive
stand like that today,'' Aaron said. ``We didn't have a union back
then. If that happened today to a player, all a player would do is
call up Don Fehr, and Don Fehr would call up Bud Selig, and that
would be the end of that.'' Aaron laughed. ``Don Fehr was still in
diapers then.''
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Gerald Ford threw out the first pitch at
Riverfront Stadium. Aaron tied the record on his first swing of the
season, a 3-1 pitch from Jack Billingham.
</P>
<P>
   He played one more game in Cincinnati _ with no homers _ then it
was back to Atlanta. About 250 members of the media followed him,
less than a third of the mob that covered McGwire and Sosa. Writer
George Plimpton was there, to write a quickie book called ``Hank
Aaron: One for the record.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great story of the year,'' Plimpton said. ``The
intensity. There was an awful lot of excitement. The whole country
was involved.''
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth inning against the Dodgers, Aaron smacked an Al
Downing pitch over the fence in left-center before a record crowd
of 53,775. The wall is still visible in the parking lot where
Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium once stood.
</P>
<P>
   In the post-homer celebration, Aaron addressed the crowd. ``I
would just like to say to all the fans here this evening that I
just thank God it's all over with. Thank you very much.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years later, Major League Baseball will honor Aaron
all season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little too little as far as I'm concerned,'' Hyland
said. ``Of course, 12 people didn't even have him on their ballot
for the Hall of Fame, which is absolutely unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said, ``I've often thought that Hank really never got
his due, as far as what he accomplished. If he had been playing for
the New York Yankees or in a big market like that, to me, he would
have gotten a lot more recognition.''
</P>
<P>
   Aaron, who hasn't swung a bat in half a dozen years _ ``I just
don't have any reason'' _ would be reluctant to relive the chase in
today's media climate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that I could stand it right now,'' he said.
``There was no ESPN, or sports all day long.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Hope, then the Braves public-relations director, said Aaron,
``handled it with a tremendous amount of grace.'' However, because
the players had ``fewer times at bat with the media'' then, Hope
said, ``People keep probing and probing for something
controversial. Hank's not a controversial person, but if you're
asked, 'Do you think there's enough blacks in management in
baseball?', you'd have to be a nitwit to say, 'Absolutely.'''
</P>
<P>
   In today's news-hungry climate, ``Henry wouldn't have been able
to move,'' said Dick Cecil, a former Braves official. ``As cool as
he is, he holds most everything in. I think eventually it would
have gotten to him a little bit. McGwire thrived on it.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's where the comparisons end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't built like McGwire; my home runs barely made it,''
Aaron said. ``Pitchers, said, 'I almost got him out.'''
</P>
<P>
   But they didn't. Until the unlikely day that his record is
broken, the home-run crown belongs to Aaron.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
Delicate operation succeeds, but accomplishes nothing 
By Jack Warner  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When last we saw Oklahoma Warner, he was indulging in
a refreshing nap before trying to snatch the Bus of Doom off the
pedestal so swiftly the cave didn't collapse on him.
</P>
<P>
   It was close, folks. Real close.
</P>
<P>
   Those who tuned in last week may remember I was trying to review
a $100 gadget called a Philips USB PC Camera, which uses the new
Universal Serial Bus connection. After a lengthy and tedious
installation project, the camera wouldn't work, presumably because
my computer's BIOS needed updating.
</P>
<P>
   Updating a BIOS is the computer equivalent of brain surgery. One
slip and the old Pentium II is a cabbage. It was not something I
wished to rush into.
</P>
<P>
   The instructions with the new Intel BIOS I downloaded from the
Gateway Web site said to begin by making a startup floppy disk
through the Create Startup tab in the Add/Remove Programs section
of the Control Panel. OK, no sweat.
</P>
<P>
   Then it said to copy onto this same disk all the files contained
in the new BIOS. Sweat.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps these instructions were purely theoretical. In the
practical world, the files wouldn't all fit on the disk. Using my
trusty 12-foot bullwhip _ being a Lash LaRue fan, I actually owned
one of these as a kid _ I shaved a few seemingly unnecessary
programs like FDISK and DRIVESPACE out of the startup disk section
so all of the BIOS files would fit.
</P>
<P>
   Shut down, insert the disk, start up. A program guided me
through the installation of the flash BIOS, with lots of red text
and exclamation marks to keep my blood pressure from falling too
low.
</P>
<P>
   The next step was to open the computer, locate jumper J7B1, and
change it from pins 1-2 to pins 2-3, which puts the computer into a
maintenance mode so one can be sure the proper processor speed is
set.
</P>
<P>
   Those of you who have never had the pleasure of fiddling with
these devices will no doubt be clamoring for elucidation here.
Jumpers are, in this case, on the motherboard of the computer. The
motherboard is a very busy place, full of all kinds of little
shapes and thingies. J7B1 is a three-pin setup. Each pin is copper,
about half the thickness of an ordinary paper-clip wire, and
perhaps a quarter of an inch long. Of course, since you are looking
pretty much straight down on them, it doesn't matter how long they
are. The jumper is a plastic affair that slips over two of the pins
to connect them.
</P>
<P>
   It took a while to find J7B1, it being dark and me being
semi-blind, but it was at least out in the open. Changing the
jumper is a simple matter if you have a hand the size and
suppleness of my 10-year-old granddaughter. But I have done enough
of these now to know what's going to happen, and to be reasonably
patient with the whole process.
</P>
<P>
   Once the jumper was changed, the computer was rebooted and the
BIOS setup checked. All was fine. The jumper was returned to pins
1-2, the computer booted again, and after a few grumbles and
whimpers it came to life in a reasonably normal fashion.
</P>
<P>
   The camera still won't work. I never really thought it would.
</P>
<P>
   I can well imagine the frustration of the average computer owner
who goes out and lays down $100 for something like this, hoping to
extend the capabilities of his equipment and have some fun. After
$200 worth of aggravation, he's right back where he started _ at
the computer store, getting a refund.
</P>
<P>
   People who don't enjoy tinkering with the insides of a computer
shouldn't feel bad about it. Most things will have a better outcome
than this, but don't go beyond a point where you feel really
uncomfortable. Do what you feel up to doing, and if that doesn't
work, then let it go.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, if I didn't get paid to do this sort of thing, I would
have tossed in the towel without trying to replace the BIOS.
Snatching the Bus of Doom safely off the pedestal was a rush, but
discovering it didn't work as advertised was a bummer. Oh, and in
case you're wondering what happened to those outraged natives I
heard screaming at the mouth of the cave, they turned out to be the
guinea pigs demanding dinner.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ For David Clark, an MIT computer scientist,
research is like ``an expedition into the future.''
</P>
<P>
   With the faculty and students at the Laboratory of Computer
Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Clark, one of
the lab's top managers, is about to embark on just such a journey _
one meant to liberate computing from the PC-centric world it has
occupied for the last two decades.
</P>
<P>
   On April 12, scientists here plan to introduce Oxygen, an
ambitious $40 million, five-year research project that is being
financed by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or
DARPA, the Pentagon's research arm. The objective is as broad as it
is audacious: to reinvent all facets of information technology,
from chips and software to computers and networks. And in the
Oxygenated future, a desktop computer would be largely beside the
point.
</P>
<P>
   In this digital new world, a person could know if a colleague
working elsewhere was reachable at her desk, because sensory-based
computers in the wall would know. A handheld point-and-click
pointing device could be used to remotely command every household
appliance to do its bidding. And instead of typing on keyboards or
stabbing at a screen with a stylus, a person would simply tell any
computer what to do.
</P>
<P>
   Or at least such concepts are the vision. In reality, the Oxygen
project, Clark said, must walk the exceedingly thin line between an
unrealistically futuristic ``Star Trek'' notion of computing and an
overly timid short-armed reach for the easily attainable.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to quantum tunnel from `It's too soon' to `It's too
late,''' he said. ``You've got to have guts.''
</P>
<P>
   It might be easy to dismiss such talk, were it not for the
Laboratory of Computer Science's track record over the last three
and a half decades. True, it has simmered at a lower publicity
temperature than its bubbly academic sister, the MIT Media
Laboratory. But since its creation in 1964, the LCS, as it is
known, has been associated with many of the most important
developments in computing.
</P>
<P>
   The lab's many historic fruits include word-processing and
spreadsheet software. And though it was invented elsewhere by
Robert Metcalfe, Ethernet, the standard architecture of today's PC
networks, was subsequently refined during the 1970s as Metcalfe
wrote his Ph.D. dissertation at the lab.
</P>
<P>
   It may be an MIT effort predating the lab by a year _ Project
MAC, set in motion by a $2 million DARPA grant in 1963 _ that
offers the best model for a project like Oxygen and the impact it
could conceivably have on the next generation of computing.
</P>
<P>
   It was Project MAC, after all, that redefined the computing
world by making it possible for many users to simultaneously share
a single computer. From Project MAC sprang innovations like an
early e-mail system and the concept of shared information
utilities, the forerunners of today's online communities and even
the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Project Oxygen, which will be formally kicked off at the
laboratory's 35th anniversary next week, is the brainchild of the
lab's director, Michael Dertouzous, a computer scientist whose own
career traces to his days working on Project MAC as an MIT student.
Intent on putting people first, Dertouzous is determined to chart
an information technology future in which computers recede into the
background.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to liberate ourselves from the tyranny of `going to
the computer,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Oxygen, seen as a proof-of-concept testbed for technologies that
others might turn into actual products, will be based on several
components that the lab is already developing.
</P>
<P>
   The first will be called Handy 21 and will be a portable device
with a small screen, a video camera, a Global Positioning System
receiver and a powerful computer. Combining the functions of a
cellular telephone, two-way data radio, television set, beeper,
handheld computer and intelligent remote-control pointing device,
the Handy 21 will rely heavily on advanced voice-recognition
technologies that have been developed at the lab.
</P>
<P>
   Speech recognition _ the ability for machines to understand
spoken instructions _ is a vital part of the Oxygen project. A
group led by the MIT speech researcher Victor Zue has developed an
approach significantly different from that now being pursued by
most others in the speech-recognition field.
</P>
<P>
   Zue's Spoken Language Systems group has developed systems with
powerful speech-recognition capabilities _ in large part because
they focus on relatively narrow subject areas, like the weather,
airline reservations or local traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to confess that I don't know how to build HAL,'' Zue
said, referring to the computer in ``2001: A Space Odyssey'' with
the complete conversational repertory of an eerily dispassionate
human being.
</P>
<P>
   The aim of the Spoken Language Systems research group is to
achieve a limited, though seemingly conversational, voice input
system by stitching together many different recognition systems
with vocabularies based on narrowly defined subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Zue cites three factors making voice recognition more important
as a computer interface: Computers are becoming increasingly
mobile; people love to talk, and the shrinking size of computers is
making the conventional keyboard a large and ungainly component.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the design effort will revolve around the idea of
delegating tasks to machines. For example, Zue said that instead of
merely inquiring of the Oxygen system when a plane is scheduled to
arrive at the airport, the user, planning to meet the flight, might
also give this command: ``Call me half an hour before Flight 116
lands.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the Handy 21, the Oxygen system will be based on another
building-block computer that the researchers call Enviro 21. These
devices, which would be powerful versions of the Handy 21 system,
would be embedded in office walls, car trunks or basements at home.
The systems would have extensive sensor networks meant to enable
them to monitor the state of the environment _ knowing whether an
office door is open, for example, or if the car trunk is unlocked
or the basement sump pump is operating.
</P>
<P>
   And besides merely sensing a situation, the Enviro 21 would have
the intelligence to instruct mechanical systems to close the door,
lock the trunk or reset the pump. Or by the same token, if an
office door is open, a distant colleague might infer that the
occupant would not mind being interrupted with a phone call.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Both the Handy 21 and the Enviro 21 will be based on a processor
chip design developed by Anant Agarwal, a computer architect at the
lab. Working with IBM, Agarwal's group is now designing a processor
architecture known as Raw. Unlike earlier chip designs which are
based on predetermined instruction sets, Raw processors subject
even the most minute, or ``raw,'' circuitry of the processor to
customization by software designers.
</P>
<P>
   Raw is a gamble, because it would be harder to program than
conventional processors. But it might have a huge payoff if the
design proves workable, by offering markedly faster data processing
and the potential for large numbers of the chips to be custom
programmed to work in powerful concert.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of our experiments will be high risk, and they will
fail,'' Dertouzous conceded. ``But there is also low-hanging
fruit.''
</P>
<P>
   Project Oxygen is the clearest example yet in a new direction in
federal financing of information technology research patterned
after previous research projects that upset the dominant computing
assumptions of their day. A notable example from the past is
Xerox's legendary Palo Alto Research Center during the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all about investing in long-term, high-risk
research,'' Tom Kalil, President Clinton's special assistant on
economic policy, said of Oxygen. ``What's motivating this is our
understanding of the impact of government investment in information
technology research in the 1960s and 1970s. Innovations from that
investment are driving the economy today.
</P>
<P>
   ``The administration,'' he said, ``really wants the research
community to invest in the future and swing for the fences.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides speech recognition and Handy 21 and Enviro 21, the other
basic technology component of Oxygen would be a computer network
capable of linking the other systems together and also connecting
to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   With these, as well the underlying software that supports the
basic technologies, Dertouzous hopes that Project Oxygen can lead
to computing systems that bring a meaningful increase in human
productivity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our overarching goal,'' he said, ``is to enable people to do
more by doing less.''

THE INTERNET MAGAZINE SALON PLANS ITS FIRST EXTENSIVE MARKETING 
CAMPAIGN.
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By LISA NAPOLI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of all the changes set to be announced today by Salon, the
online magazine published by Salon Internet Inc., perhaps the
biggest is a new address.
</P>
<P>
   After three and a half years of haggling, David Talbott, Salon's
editor and founder, has persuaded the owner of the Internet
address, www.salon.com, to sell his domain name.
</P>
<P>
   Talbot is counting not only on the new Internet address but on a
national advertising campaign, a newly designed site and a larger
staff to help attract many more visitors to his digital
publication. More visitors, in turn, would attract new advertisers.
Regular advertisers in Salon already include the Saturn unit of the
General Motors Corp. DaimlerChrysler AG's Mercedes-Benz division
and the AT&AMP;T Corp..
</P>
<P>
   Talbot and his staff have been rethinking Salon and the role it
should play in the ever-dense media universe since late last year,
primarily because of the news media attention and the controversy
Salon attracted as Congress moved toward impeaching President
Clinton. In September, the magazine reported that Rep. Henry Hyde,
the Republican chairman of the House Judiciary Committee who would
lead the impeachment effort, had once been involved in an
extra-marital affair. That report sent potential readers searching
for the Web site of the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   But many could not find it. Instead, when readers logged on to
the address where they thought they would find Salon, they instead
found themselves at a Web site owned by Roy Frederickson, who owns
two beauty salons in Austin, Texas Frederickson said he was
planning to use the site as a portal for the hairdressing business.
</P>
<P>
   Salon magazine, meanwhile, had been residing at three Internet
addresses _ www.salon1999.com, www.salonmagazine.com and
www.salon.net _ since its debut in November 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Though Talbot would not disclose the exact price he paid for
www.salon.com, he did say a promise of stock, an undisclosed sum of
cash and the salon.net domain finally persuaded Frederickson to
sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only reason I agreed to the deal is I respect what they're
doing,'' Frederickson said. ``Nothing they could have said would
have convinced me if I didn't think they had a great future.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with its old address, however, Salon had been attracting
1.2 million different visitors a month, according to Talbot.
</P>
<P>
   But to expand the magazine from a haven for intellectual essays
and commentaries from the likes of Sallie Tisdale, Camille Paglia
and Anne Lamott, Talbot knew the domain name was key. Still, he
also saw the Web growing from a curious oddity to a critical
information source, and he decided he needed to change his
publication as the public perception of the Web matured.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a medium for New Yorker-type content. It's a
medium for newspaper-type content,'' he said. ``What the Web is
mostly known for at this point is cud-chewing punditry. That's
fine. It's a good medium for that. We decided we want to go beyond
that and start breaking stories.''
</P>
<P>
   But he acknowledged that breaking news on a Web site, where
boutique magazines sit side by side with behemoth news-gathering
institutions like CNN and where publishing cycles never cease, will
be a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't compete on that level,'' he said. ``We can make a
contribution, as we did with coverage of Ken Starr and the
impeachment hearings. It's a huge goal and we don't take it on
lightly.''
</P>
<P>
   Salon will be introducing two sections today, focusing on health
and people. Obituaries are being added to the site as well, Talbot
said, along with a daily gossip column. And the magazine is opening
an office in Washington, where it has hired two staff reporters. In
all, 20 new staff members have been added.
</P>
<P>
   Talbot said he was now attracting financial interest from
venture capitalists who had once shunned companies like Salon that
created original content for the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we started, no one wanted to invest in content
companies,'' he said. ``Everyone said, `We're interested in
E-commerce.''' But those attitudes have changed this year, Talbot
said.
</P>
<P>
   Salon posted revenue of $3.5 million in its fiscal year ended
April 1, derived largely from advertising, but Talbot said the
magazine was not yet profitable. As for whether the company would
file for an initial public offering and seize the frenzied momentum
from Internet stocks, he said, ``We'd have to be crazy not to
consider it seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest round of venture capital financing is helping to pay
for the expanded staff and to start Salon's first advertising
campaign, created by Odiorne Wilde Narraway &AMP; Partners in San
Francisco, in print magazines including The New Yorker, American
Monthly, Rolling Stone, Entertainment Weekly and Fast Company next
month. A radio campaign will begin shortly thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   Except for one advertisement a year in The New York Times Book
Review to announce its annual book awards, ``we haven't spent a
dime,'' Talbot said, ``unlike people like Candice Carpenter and
iVillage,'' referring to the co-founder of the online site for
women. ``We obviously need to do more of what they've done. We're
taking an aggressive stance.''
</P>
<P>
   This is another reason he considers the simplified Web address
to be so critical. There is nothing particularly catchy or
memorable about having to explain that Salon can be found anywhere
other than www.salon.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's gold,'' he said. ``It's priceless.''

NEW RULES MAY CHALLENGE INTERNET DOMAIN-NAME SPECULATORS

 By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tom Kaplan is a stockbroker by day, managing money for wealthy
clients who gamble their fortunes in regulated markets. But his off
time is spent on a new and controversial investment game in which
he and two partners have wagered tens of thousands of dollars on
catchy words and names that they hope to resell as valuable
Internet addresses.
</P>
<P>
   Though often labeled hijackers, pirates or extortionists,
``cybersquatters'' is the most common term for investors who
stockpile Internet addresses derived from popular words, titles or
celebrities' names.
</P>
<P>
   For an investment of just $70, they can secure two-year rights
to an address. In return, they can reap handsome rewards from
companies eager to protect products or trademarks. Sometimes the
buyer is an individual with a compelling interest in using a
specific word or name in a World Wide Web site's address.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan says he and his colleagues are simply creative investors,
speculators who stake perfectly legal claims in the
rough-and-tumble land rush in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   But their investments may soon become a lot riskier. Faced with
mounting disputes about Internet addresses and complaints from
trademark holders, a U.N. agency is completing a proposal for
bringing order to the chaotic assignment of addresses in
cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   The agency, the World Intellectual Property Organization, or
WIPO, is drafting new rules for registering domain names, as
Internet addresses are known. It will submit its recommendations to
the nonprofit corporation established last year by the Commerce
Department to take over administration of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   A top priority of that nonprofit, the Internet Corp. for
Assigned Names and Numbers, is to introduce competition into the
business of registering top-level domains, which is now handled by
Network Solutions Inc. under an exclusive government contract.
</P>
<P>
   Esther Dyson, the interim chairwoman of the corporation, said
she expected her group would adopt rules on cybersquatting before
authorizing any new top-level domains, the categories of Internet
addresses denoted by suffixes like .com, .edu, and .net.
</P>
<P>
   Internet addresses can be valuable enough to attract speculators
because most choice names within existing top-level domains are
already claimed. But in trying to accommodate both special
interests and international trademark laws, the proposals raise as
many questions as they answer.
</P>
<P>
   And those who would tame the Internet are finding that for every
new winner, there is almost certainly a loser.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most vocal critics of the WIPO draft proposal has been
A. Michael Froomkin, a law professor at the University of Miami and
a member of the agency's advisory board on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Froomkin says the consequences of the proposed rules could go
far beyond the intended crackdown on cybersquatters. Unless the
proposals are revised, he warns, the Internet will end up with a
legal system that could stifle free expression and enable
governments and corporate interests to intimidate individuals into
relinquishing addresses to which they have rightful claims.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, he says, enforcement would be a bureaucratic
nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   The agency has proposed, for example, that when people register
names in any top-level domain, they must agree to a procedure
permitting anyone anywhere to challenge that registration at any
time. The disputes would be settled by arbitration, but the outcome
might depend on any number of international trademark laws. And
whoever loses could be liable for all legal costs.
</P>
<P>
   Froomkin and others say that the plan would let companies engage
in reverse domain hijacking, claiming any address that contains or
suggests their names or trademarks.
</P>
<P>
   Such a policy could, for instance, hurt people like Chris Van
Allen, a Pennsylvanian teen-ager whose father registered pokey.org,
an address that reflected Chris' nickname, Pokey, as a present for
his twelfth birthday.
</P>
<P>
   The Prema Toy Co., which holds the trademarks to the well-known
Gumby and Pokey bendable toys, last year tried to seize the domain
name, even though the boy had no content related to the toys on his
page. Prema eventually dropped its claim.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed U.N. rules also raise questions of free-speech
rights. Is it a violation of free-speech rights to prevent someone
from using the name of a politician, government official or
corporation in the address of a Web site that criticizes or
parodies its namesake? One trend among cybersquatters has been
securing addresses based on trademarks with the addition of the
word ``sucks.''
</P>
<P>
   Companies often buy up such names to keep them out of the hands
of critics and disgruntled former employees.
</P>
<P>
   Francis Gurry, legal counsel for WIPO, said he intended to make
significant revisions to the draft proposal before its submission
later this month. He said he anticipated that the final proposal
would define squatters more narrowly and would not give a trademark
owner the right to make a claim just because a domain includes its
name or a variation of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot interest in differentiation of commercial and
noncommercial domains,'' Gurry said last month in Washington, where
the panel he heads was holding the last in a series of
international public hearings on the draft proposal. ``Another
evolution that we see is limiting the mandatory administrative
dispute resolutions procedure to cases of cybersquatting.''
</P>
<P>
   He defined cybersquatting as ``repeated cases of targeting in
bad faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Other claims, like standard trademark disputes or cases
involving different companies with the same names, would still be
resolved in traditional courts.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would also require prepayment of domain
registration fees, to deter squatters who register names and then
try to resell them before the bills come due.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Even modified rules could leave speculators like Kaplan
operating in a gray area. He and his partners, Eric Stuerken and
Richard Presig, have pooled some $40,000 and paid for all their
domain names. He also said that some names they registered are no
more than catchy words that people starting new businesses might
want.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is pure arbitrage,'' Kaplan said. ``It's a free market
that they put out there.'' Still, he admits, he and his partners
seek unclaimed names of celebrities or groups.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, he saw Glenn Rifkin, the co-author of a book
called ``Radical Marketing,'' promote it on CNBC in January. Rifkin
had already applied for the name radicalmarketing.com, but did so
through an Internet service provider, rather than applying directly
to the central registry.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan made his application directly and got the name. When
Rifkin discovered that the address was taken, he tracked Kaplan to
a Long Island brokerage firm, HD Brous &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan insists that he and his partners have not _ at least yet
_ tried to track down potential buyers of the names they have
purchased, like barrydiller.com.
</P>
<P>
   But that does not mean they are not for sale. Rifkin says Kaplan
and his partners offered to sell him the name for ``five figures''
after he tracked them down.
</P>
<P>
   ``They quite aggressively tried to sell me the name, having
three different people phone me,'' Rifkin said, ``one in particular
saying outright that I'd be surprised at how much information they
knew about me, including the fact that I had access to the kind of
cash I'd need to buy the name.''
</P>
<P>
   Furious, but left with few options, Rifkin instead registered
the domain name radmarketing.com.

STUDY SAYS INTERNET BECOMING A FORCE IN SEXUALITY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By ERIC DRUDIS   
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ An estimated 4.6 million daily Internet users
may end up having more sex with a mouse than a person, according to
a study published in a leading psychology journal.
</P>
<P>
   A whopping 4.6 million of the estimated 57 million people who
use the Internet daily could become hooked on cybersex, said Dr.
Alvin Cooper, the study's lead author and director of the San Jose
Marital and Sexuality Centre.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper, whose study is being published by the American
Psychological Association in the April issue of Professional
Psychology: Research and Practice, said the Internet has spawned a
sexual revolution with more than 9 million people visiting erotic
Web sites daily, sending suggestive e-mail or joining sexual chat
rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen to 30 percent of the on-line population goes to sexual
Web sites, and sex is the most popular on-line search topic, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet has evolved as a really powerful force in
sexuality because ... it offers affordability, accessibility and
anonymity,'' Cooper said Wednesday. ``It is not a good thing or a
bad thing. On-line sexuality is like a vehicle that can be driven
recklessly or enhance people's lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper's study analyzed 9,177 of the 13,000 Internet users who
responded. According to Cooper, 86 percent of those responding to
the Internet survey were men. The survey was conducted over a
three-week period beginning in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cybersex has gotten increasing attention and no research. It's
all hype and speculation and no facts,'' said Cooper, a training
coordinator at the Department of Counseling and Psychological
Services at Stanford University.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper said 8.5 percent of the study's participants searched for
sexual material on line for more than 11 hours a week, generally
leading to serious problems in their lives. Most of these people
demonstrated signs of ``sexual compulsivity,'' or a very high
on-line sex drive, Cooper said. About 47 percent of his sample
spent less than 60 minutes a week on line for sexual activities.
They demonstrated no sexual difficulties in life, Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
   The study _ co-authored by Coralaie Scherer, Sylvain Boies and
Barry Gordon _ has come under fire because it collected all its
data on line from willing participants through the MSNBC Internet
site. No follow-up phone calls could be made by the researchers to
confirm the reliability of the respondents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly not a random sample,'' said David C. Heilbron,
a former statistics professor at the University of California at
San Francisco. ``I don't think it means anything about Internet
users of the population in general. It's just a group of people who
chose to respond to this particular inquiry.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper defended his research. ``You don't do a study about
on-line sex off line,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have this myth that people go on-line in an uncontrolled
way and cybersex takes over their lives,'' Cooper said. ``But those
who use the Internet as a recreational tool rather than in a sexual
way demonstrate no significant problems. It's like watching
`Baywatch' or looking at Victoria's Secret catalogs.''
</P>
<P>
   But psychologist Pauline Holmes of Christian Psychotherapy and
Family Counseling in San Francisco disagreed, calling cybersex
destructive to families.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would look at it as a form of adultery even though it
doesn't necessarily involve physical contact,'' Holmes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people nowadays don't think oral sex is sex, so
looking at a computer definitely couldn't be sex, but the fact of
the matter is that cybersex is sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Because almost everyone has unfaithful thoughts, the real issue
becomes how serious cybersex becomes.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing is looking at pornographic materials and sexual
literature,'' Holmes said. ``Getting involved with another person
on-line _ that's definitely another level.''

MUSEUM PLUGS IN TO INTERACTIVE COMPUTER ART 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By PATTI HARTIGAN   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LINCOLN, Mass. _ Our mission today is to heed the advice of
new-media artist Jennifer Hall. That means we have to shut down our
computer, turn off our modem. We have to stop, breathe, think. Sip
a cup of coffee, the real stuff, not the virtual kind.
</P>
<P>
   Now, you might expect someone like Hall to take a certain smug
pleasure in the current technology craze or even enjoy a little ``I
told you so'' glee as she observes a society racing to keep pace
with the Information Age. She is, after all, a local guru of art
and new media, with a master's in visual studies from MIT and 15
years of experience as the visionary leader of the Do While Studio,
a sort of high-tech atelier.
</P>
<P>
   You would think all this would make Hall a happy preacher who
has seen her cause move from the fringes to the masses. You would
think it was payback time. Think again. ``In the '70s, we were the
people on the edge, the intellects and the wackos,'' she says. ``In
some ways I should be thrilled. Our mission came true. More artists
are into new media. But we're all on this treadmill. We're all
running around looking for the next new gizmo without stopping to
ask, `Why?' This culture doesn't ask those questions. We just
upgrade to the next level.''
</P>
<P>
   We upgrade. We download. We plug in. We freak out. And even
though Hall has been championing technology for two decades, she's
worried about the consequences of our mad dash to get wired. She
even questions the terminology, as new phrases are coined to
capitalize on the fad of the moment. Take the word ``cyberart.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a term that cropped up so quickly, but we've been doing
it for quite a while,'' Hall says. ``People put a label on it to
give it identity, clarity, and perhaps style and glamour. Everyone
is grabbing onto it hook, line, and sinker because it's suddenly
prestigious and glorious and glamorous. I worry about that.''
</P>
<P>
   She worries about a world in which everyone is racing to beat
the next guy at the best way to simulate reality in cyberspace.
Nobody is interested in a pure experience anymore: We want a
simulation of a simulation, brought to us ``live'' on the Internet.
Hall suspected there was something odd about ``virtual reality'' a
long time ago. Her mother was a producer for early television and
Hall performed in commercials for products like Crest. One day, she
accompanied her mother to the set of a commercial for Cascade, a
dishwashing soap. ``One of the talents said, `It's virtually
spotless,' and I said, `Mom, what does virtually spotless mean?'
She said, `Sshhh, it means it has spots!' They couldn't say it was
spotless because of the liability, so the lawyers came in and said
to use the word `virtual.' That makes it meaningless. That's
amusing to me.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early days of television, the medium had the potential to
bring information to the masses in a positive way, but as anyone
with a remote control knows, the medium is all about money and
commercial, prepackaged pablum. Hall worries that the new
technology is destined to lose its potential as well. ``There's
still time, though,'' she says. ``What happens if we all stop,
breathe, have a cup of coffee? What happens if we take a moment to
stop and ask, `Why?' ''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC;  The artists are the ones who ought to be asking those
questions, and the exhibit aims to do just that. In addition to
Hall's work, the show features Chris Dodge's ``What Will Remain of
These?,'' an installation that records human activity on a vast
data network in the DeCordova gallery. It also showcases Karl
Sims's ``Galapagos,'' an interactive installation that mimics
Darwinian evolution. (See related story.) Hall's work is the
``$12.99 special'' of the show, an ``odd science-fair-type
project'' called ``Acupuncture for Temporal Fruit,'' created with
engineer Marc LoCascio.
</P>
<P>
   It's a series of 12 domes equipped with robotic devices that
operate acupuncture needles. As visitors move through the gallery,
the needles are activated to punch holes in tomatoes inside the
dome. OK. Let's take a moment and ask, ``Why?''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of pieces converge: the health industry, Western
medicine and Eastern medicine, the organic form surrounded by
technology,'' Hall says. ``The technology pokes holes in this
thing, and every time you poke at it, the biological form
disintegrates.''
</P>
<P>
   When Hall was building the piece at the Do While Studio, other
artists at the center followed its progression with rapt attention.
``Some people called it cruel and I find that interesting. It's
such an intense word for a tomato. When we see technology up
against an organic form, it blows our mind. It either terrifies us
or thrills us, but it's something we have to think about.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a certain cachet now for art that brushes up against
technology. But for Hall, there's nothing new in that at all.
``Science and art were together for most of humankind: Think about
the development of pigment, of casting techniques. The technologies
of the day were first scribed by artists. It's only in this
bizarre, postmodern goo that we have made artists separate from
technology. What's happening now is a re-fusion.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's a good thing. Or is it? ``The immersion in technology
can be a very bad thing for artists,'' says Hall. ``You have to
figure it out, but you have to be both inside of it and outside of
it.'' She spends half her time running Do While and teaching new
media at Massachusetts College of Art. The rest of the time, she
lives in a technology-free cabin in the woods in New Hampshire. (It
has electricity and a phone, but no computers.)
</P>
<P>
   She's been plugging away all these years, but now that everyone
else is plugged in, she's urging folks to plug out _ at least for a
cup of coffee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in danger of becoming a feudalistic society,'' she says.
``There is a chasm between the knowing and the not-knowing.
Everyone feels behind. Everyone feels like they're not as smart as
the next guy. The train is out of control and there ain't nobody at
the wheel. How can we slow the train? We can't see the scenery. And
if the journey is what we're here to do, why are we going so
fast?''

LESSONS FROM MELISSA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SIMSON L. GARFINKLE   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the Melissa virus hit last Friday it had all of the
markings of an impending electronic plague. Within an hour and a
half, I received two copies of the virus: one from a public
relations firm in California and one from a company specializing in
computer security. The following day I received my third copy of
the virus, from somebody else at the public relations firm.
</P>
<P>
   Out on the Internet, things were bad and getting worse. Melissa
was shutting down e-mail systems all over the United States. Even
worse, Melissa was revealing potential confidential information _
e-mail addresses and business contacts _ every time it ran on an
unsuspecting victim's computer. Worst of all, perhaps, the virus
could be copied by others to produce even more dangerous viruses
and attack programs.
</P>
<P>
   But the disaster did not get as bad as some predicted. Articles
in the newspaper, on radio, television, and of course, on the
Internet, effectively mobilized the computer-using public. People
were warned that if they received an e-mail message from somebody
that they knew, with the words ``Important Message From'' in the
``Subject:'' line, they should not, under any circumstances, open
the accompanying Microsoft Word document called ``list.doc.''
</P>
<P>
   There are two important lessons from the Melissa experience. The
first is that computer users can generally do a good job protecting
themselves when they are informed about the risks and perils of
computing.
</P>
<P>
   But the second is that many businesses don't spend the time and
resources to properly train their employees before a major incident
_ and a result, they frequently pay more when there are problems.
</P>
<P>
   Most companies wouldn't think of letting an employee drive a
forklift or service an elevator unless that person had been first
properly trained. That's because property can be damaged, and
people can be injured or killed, if heavy machinery is improperly
used. But these same companies don't see the equal need to train
somebody before that person is set down at a desktop computer.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, as the Melissa virus demonstrated, improperly
trained computer users can be fairly costly to an organization. And
even in the absence of an electronic menace such as Melissa, people
who don't have sufficient training just aren't as productive as
people who understand the software that they're expected to use.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of companies are missing the boat,'' says Jennifer
Launier, marketing manager at New Horizons Computer Learning
Centers of Boston, a major player in the computer training market.
``They don't realize the return on their training investment.
Training can increase a person's productivity by up to 6 times,''
she says, citing a Gartner Group study on the topic.
</P>
<P>
   Consider basic word processing. Thanks to Melissa, many users of
Microsoft Word now know that it's somewhat risky to run the
Microsoft Word macros that might be included in an e-mail
attachment that they receive. There's nothing new here: Word Macro
viruses have been endemic ever since Microsoft released Word '95,
the first word processor which had the capability of storing macros
in standard word processor documents.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the majority of Microsoft Word users still have
very little clue how to effectively use their word processor. Few
Word users, for example, know how to set tab stops. Instead, they
just pound the space bar or repeatedly hit the tab key to line text
up in columns.
</P>
<P>
   Another important feature that gets unused are ``styles'' _ the
ability to define different fonts, margins and line spacing to
different paragraph types. One of the great advantages of styles is
that they make it easy to change formatting throughout a whole
document at once. Another nifty feature is automatic numbering:
Word can automatically keep track of chapter and section numbers,
then automatically renumber the sections in your contract or book
when you make changes.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people think that learning how to use those
``advanced'' features like tabs, styles, and even macros just takes
more time than it is worth. After all, it does take time to learn
these features. But just as learning to type is time spent
well-spent, so is time spent learning how to use a sophisticated
application program.
</P>
<P>
   One of the easiest ways to learn a computer program is by
reading the manual. Computer manuals certainly aren't great works
of literature, but they usually do a good job explaining how to use
a program. Manuals also can point out features in a program that
aren't immediately obvious. The computer industry even has a quick
retort for those pesky users who ask questions without first
reading the supplied manual. That expression is
</P>
<P>
   RTFM, short for ``Read the Fabulous Manual'' (or something like
that).
</P>
<P>
   Another way to learn about new software is to sit down and
systematically go through all of the menus and options panels. This
can take a lot of time and rarely looks to a manager or a boss like
time well spent, but it can make an inquisitive person dramatically
more productive when using the program. Sadly, many computer users
are afraid to exercise all of the features of their programs, for
fear that they might break something.
</P>
<P>
   Many schools and universities offer some level of training for
their students and employees. Sometimes these classes are free;
other times there is a nominal charge. Many companies operate
classrooms where every student gets his or her own computer and a
workbook.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there are a growing number of self-employed training
consultants who will come to a company, large or small, and teach
people on their own computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most importantly I explain that the Help F1 or Help tutorial
will have most of the answers when running the application,'' says
John Leonard, a local training consultant. ``Don't get frustrated
with what is happening _ use F1 to see what should be done. It's
amazing how few users relate to the
</P>
<P>
   importance of (built-in) Help functions.''

RIO, MP3s DELIVER TUNES FOR OUR TIMES 
By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the last couple of years, prognosticators have been saying
that simple Internet appliances would eventually do away with most
folks' need for a personal computer. Why put up with the
inefficiencies, cost and complexity of a PC when you can have all
the power you need in the palm of your hand?
</P>
<P>
   However, so far it appears that reports of the PC's death have
been greatly exaggerated. Internet appliances are few and far
between, and those that have made it to market are not
mega-sellers.
</P>
<P>
   That is, with one fascinating and surprising exception: the Rio.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of Internet appliances usually tout e-mail, Web
surfing _ even online phone calls. But who would have thought that
the first really popular Net appliance would have been something
you use to listen to music?
</P>
<P>
   Diamond Multimedia's Rio PMP300 allows you to store tunes that
you download from the Internet, or copy from compact disks. It uses
a format known as MP3, which creates music files that are highly
compressed and are of reasonable quality. Although true audiophiles
may turn their noses up at MP3s, the sound is likely to please most
listeners.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
MUSIC INDUSTRY SOUNDS ALARMS
</P>
<P>
   Both MP3 and the Rio have given the traditional music industry
fits, and are illustrative of the oft-quoted pronouncement that
``the Internet changes everything.''
</P>
<P>
   The big recording companies are alarmed at the explosive
popularity of MP3s because it undermines their control of music
distribution. Suddenly, thousands of previously unknown bands and
individual artists can get their work heard worldwide merely by
submitting MP3 files to Web sites such as MP3.com. This also means
that musicians who don't fit an easily defined commercial mold can
get a global hearing, even if they're not considered commercially
viable enough to land a recording contract.
</P>
<P>
   The industry also is concerned about piracy _ it's easy to
convert a CD track into an MP3 file, though the sound quality isn't
as good.
</P>
<P>
   The recording companies are attempting to come up with their
own, alternative music file format that will, in some way, prevent
piracy. But I suspect it'll be too little, too late _ the genie is
out of the bottle with MP3, and there's no stuffing him back in.
</P>
<P>
   If MP3 makes the music moguls nervous, then the Rio has given
them convulsions. They tried unsuccessfully in court to stop
Diamond from distributing it, arguing it would encourage piracy.
But Diamond correctly argued that, because the Rio only downloads
music and doesn't upload it to another PC, that piracy is not even
an issue.
</P>
<P>
   Although Diamond won with this argument, amateur, independent
software programmers have now produced programs that let you move
MP3 files out of a Rio and onto a PC's hard drive. Whether the
recording industry will take another legal run at the Rio as a
result is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
QUALITY PLAYS IMPORTANT ROLE
</P>
<P>
   I've been playing with a Rio for several weeks, and I understand
all the fuss. This is a pretty cool gadget, if a little expensive.
It has a list price of about $200 _ it needs to sell for half that
or less in order to be a true mass-market device. It also needs
simpler software.
</P>
<P>
   The Rio's black, plastic case is slightly smaller than a pack of
cigarettes, yet it has all the functions you'd find on a portable
compact disk player _ play, stop, fast forward, rewind, random play
and so on.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of storing music on disk or tape, it holds MP3 files
in 32 megabytes of computer memory. You can also insert the small
Flash Media cards that are used to hold pictures in some digital
cameras for extra storage.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, you can hold up to an hour's worth of music, but that
really depends on the quality of the MP3 files. When you record an
MP3, you can vary the amount of compression _ the more compression,
the more you lose in sound quality. At the full 60 minutes, most
music sounds like a decent-quality FM radio. If you decrease the
compression, it sounds more like a good portable tape player.
</P>
<P>
   It comes with headphones that are actually tiny speakers you jam
into your ears. It's a little uncomfortable, but I got used to it
after a while. The sound is not bad, but you can always replace
them with a more traditional headset.
</P>
<P>
   To connect the Rio to your Windows 95/98 PC, just plug the
accompanying adapter into your parallel port _ it has a
pass-through for your printer _ and then plug the Rio into the
adapter. I found the adapter conflicted with some other devices
that use the parallel port, such as an external, re-writable CD-ROM
drive I was testing.
</P>
<P>
   The Rio comes with software that lets you convert CD tracks to
MP3 files, as well as organize MP3 files into play lists. However,
this software is separate from the program you use to transfer the
tunes into the Rio.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Rio's software is its weakest component. I found it
confusing to use, with too many small windows. To use it, you first
must create a play list in one window, then copy the list,
file-by-file, into another window that represents the Rio's memory.
It can be complicated further if you are working with CD-based
music, which must be converted.
</P>
<P>
   This should all be one step _ I'd like to copy a CD tune
directly into the Rio, with the MP3 conversion process rendered
transparent. Or, how about a browser plug-in that can transfer a
file right from an MP3 Web site into the Rio.
</P>
<P>
   In the future, I suspect we'll see all this, and in similar
devices that cost much less _ in the $30-$40 price range. But for
now, the Rio gives a nifty glance into the intriguing future of
music.

WAYS TO WORK AROUND WINDOWS DESIGN FLAW
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN  
c.1999 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I recently had a close call. I installed an older program
that overwrote a crucial Windows 98 file in the windowssystem
folder. When I tried to start my computer the next time, Windows
locked up. When I called technical support for the maker of that
program, they knew what was wrong and told me I should reinstall
Windows _ or get the Windows 98 copy of the file that had been
replaced. Fortunately, I had another computer in the house with
Windows 98 and just copied the file. But is there any way I can
avoid this in the future?
</P>
<P>
   A: One of the major flaws in the design of Windows is that it
does little to prevent older programs from placing outdated system
files on your hard drive. Usually this is not a major problem, but
occasionally users will run into the kind of problem you
experienced.
</P>
<P>
   One way to avoid the problem is to update to the latest versions
of your Windows software. Newer install routines often check the
dates of files being replaced, and you get a message that says
something like: ``This program is about to replace a file that's
older than the file currently on your system. Would you like to
keep your file?'' When you see this, always keep that file!
</P>
<P>
   If your system is functional when you've overwritten a system
file, Windows 98 provides a way to restore the file. The System
Information Tool (in the Accessories/System Tools folder) called
the System File Checker. It will make sure you have the proper
files. It also lets you extract a single file from the Windows 98
CD and put it back into the system folder.
</P>
<P>
   You might also find the file you need in the windowssysbkup,
which stores certain crucial components of Windows. Simply copy
what you need to the appropriate folder.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Internet Explorer 5 is great, but there is one feature that I
really dislike. Whenever I type a Web address into the address
field, a drop-down box appears with suggested URLs. Is there a way
to turn this off?
</P>
<P>
   A: Sure. Right-click on the Internet Explorer icon and choose
Properties, then click on the Advanced tab. Scroll down until you
see ``Use inline Auto-Complete for Web addresses,'' and uncheck
that box. Click OK.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have been shopping for a new computer and have decided to
get a DVD drive in it, but I don't understand the pros and cons of
getting a drive with its own controller card, vs. one that controls
the drive with software. Can you talk about the trade-offs?
</P>
<P>
   A: A DVD drive requires either a hardware or software component
to decode what's found on a DVD disk into video. This is handled
one of two ways _ through a software program or an add-on card
that's inserted into a PCI slot.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, the hardware configuration is going to be more robust
_ video quality will be somewhat better and playback smoother.
However, the card will occupy a free slot, which may be an issue if
you have lots of other devices added to your computer.
</P>
<P>
   Software decoding actually works fairly well, particularly in a
high-end computer. If you end up buying a PC with a processor
that's 400 megahertz or faster, software should be more than
adequate. However, if you plan on having a lot of other things
going on at the same you watch DVD video, you could experience some
jerkiness.
</P>

MICROSOFT LOOKING TO INVENT A BETTER MOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By LONNIE BROWN   
 Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A little blue box, just big enough to hold a tub of margarine,
arrived in the mail the other day. What was inside was nearly as
intriguing as the lettering on the outside of the box.
</P>
<P>
   ``In technology, 30 isn't old. It's ancient.''
</P>
<P>
   If you're 30 years old (or older), it's a line that may make you
feel like you're old enough to be sucked from the bowels of the
earth and turned into the next barrel of crude oil.
</P>
<P>
   The box opened on the opposite side of that slogan, and on the
bottom flap was printed another teaser: ``You don't use a computer
that was designed in 1968. ...''
</P>
<P>
   The year is a clue: What we're discussing here was originally
called the ``X-Y Position Indicator for a Display System'' when it
was shown publicly for the first time at the 1968 Fall Joint
Computer Conference in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   It gained patent number 3,541,541 on Nov. 17, 1970.
</P>
<P>
   You know it better by its more descriptive handle: the mouse.
</P>
<P>
   And indeed, on the inside flap of the box the teaser that began,
``You don't use a computer that was designed in 1968'' was
completed: ``So why use mouse technology that was?''
</P>
<P>
   The contents of the box was a single rubber-coated ball from the
aforementioned pointing technology.
</P>
<P>
   The box was from Microsoft, which, the inside flap said, ``has
thrown out the old parts used to create the mouse _ and will soon
introduce something better. Much better.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the mouse ball has been ripped out of some pointing
devices before _ although it's still the most common method used
for moving the cursor around the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Some mice use an optical-sensor system popularized by Logitech:
When the mouse is moved, a slotted wheel interrupts a light source
inside the mouse. Depending on how many times the light source is
interrupted determines how far the mouse moves.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1975, Microsoft will eventually move to the
30-and-older group that includes the dinosaur-like mouse it seeks
to redesign. Microsoft officials aren't saying much about the new
mouse, which will be introduced at Spring Comdex 99, a computer
show running April 19-22 in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   With no ball underneath, it will either have to rely on an
optical or sonic system. And since Microsoft has shown a great deal
of innovation in pointing devices over the last two years, it may
even take a major leap forward and use some sort of laser that can
pinpoint its location precisely when used in conjunction with a
special computer mouse pad.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1997, Microsoft introduced IntelliMouse, a mouse
that had a small wheel on its back. With it, users could quickly
scroll through a document without moving the mouse. It's gotten
good reviews and it can actually speed up the computing process:
Studies show that it can increase productivity by about 25 percent
when used to review documents and perform other tasks.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft sells about 14 million mice a year and has a lion-size
share of the market.
</P>
<P>
   Spring Comdex 99 may bring forth the mouse that roared.
</P>
<P>
   CHECKING OUT Y2K
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft also has a free ``Tools for Y2K Assessment.'' A
company spokesman said the tools, available for download at the
Microsoft Web site (www.microsoft.com/year2000) scans a computer's
hard drive (as well as network drives) searching out Microsoft
products.
</P>
<P>
   It then generates a report with year 2000-compliance
information. If updating is required, the program supplies the
links to Web sites dealing with the products.
</P>
<P>
   It is now available in English and will be available in 14 other
languages by mid-spring. It will also be included in this month's
release of the Microsoft Year 2000 Resource CD.

 Column: NetZero Looks Like the Real Deal  
 By David Einstein   
 c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Question: &LR;  I recently heard about a company called NetZero that
gives free Internet access. I looked at what they're offering, and
on the surface, it looks good. They have numerous local telephone
numbers, unlimited access, etc. The claim is that they do not need
to charge because they make money strictly through advertisers. I'd
appreciate any information you can provide.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  NetZero looks like the real deal to me, too. Based in
Southern California, it has quickly grown to be one of the top 10
Internet service providers in the country, with more than 600,000
users. Its popularity isn't surprising when you consider that it
gives away a service for which most ISPs charge about $20 a month.
</P>
<P>
   The only catch is that you must put up with a constant barrage
of ads, which NetZero displays in a 1-by-3-inch window on your
desktop the entire time you're online. And that's in addition to
the regular banner ads on Web pages that you visit. NetZero's
advertisers, which include Disney, eBay, Macy's and Nissan, are
able to target their ads by using personal information you provide
when you sign up for the service, and through your dial-in number,
which tells them where you live.
</P>
<P>
   To use NetZero, you must use its software, which delivers the
ads. For browsing and e-mail, you can use either Netscape
Communicator or Microsoft Internet Explorer. You can download the
software, find out if there's a local dial-in number near you and
get connected by going to www.netzero.com.
</P>
<P>
   Prying Eyes
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have just started a new job and would like to use my lunch
hour to write some personal e-mail to people outside the company.
I'm hesitant, however, because the company's policy is that e-mail
is not private. They say they are monitoring e-mail, but I don't
know what that means, and I don't feel comfortable enough to ask
them. Does my boss have the ability to read my mail?
</P>
<P>
   A: Your boss probably can read your mail if he or she wants to.
Assuming you're using a conventional system like Outlook or
Exchange, all your messages are stored on a server computer until
they're deleted. (Some companies get rid of e-mail every week;
others keep it for months.) As long as messages are in the system,
they're fair game for anyone with the authority to access them.
</P>
<P>
   If I were you, I'd ask my supervisor whether it's OK to use the
e-mail system for personal messages. If it is, just follow a few
simple rules and you'll never have to worry:
</P>
<P>
   _Don't write anything in an e-mail message that you couldn't say
out loud in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   _Don't discuss company business, especially competitive
strategies. E-mail like that can land you on the witness stand.
Just ask Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   _Never, in writing of any kind, refer to your boss as a horse's
rear end.
</P>
<P>
   Stuck Zipper
</P>
<P>
   Q: Often, when I download something off the Internet, it is in a
zip file configuration. Windows will ask which program I want to
use to view the file. I don't know even know if my computer has
such a program. Please tell me what I have to do to use zip files.
</P>
<P>
   A: You need a zipping-unzipping program, something that doesn't
come with Windows. The best one, IMNSHO (that's Internet for ``in
my not so humble opinion'') is WinZip, a $29 shareware program that
you can download from any shareware site including www.hotfiles.com
and www.shareware.com.
</P>
<P>
   A program such as WinZip is designed to manage files that are
compressed so that they take up less space (and can be downloaded
faster). Some compressed files end in .zip _ hence the zip
designation. Zip files can be a single file or many files zipped
together, as is often the case with programs that you download.
</P>
<P>
   Pentium Power
</P>
<P>
   Q: My good friend Jerry saved up for two years to get a computer
and got an HP 366-MHz Celeron system. He only has an eighth-grade
education and is very visually impaired, but he loves his computer.
He likes to play video games, but a lot of the games he wants say
the minimum system requirement is a Pentium II, and he figures that
because he doesn't have a Pentium II, he wouldn't be able to use
the games. Is that right?
</P>
<P>
   A: I've got good news for Jerry. The Celeron is a Pentium II,
just a little slower version of it. The 366-MHz chip in his machine
should be plenty fast enough to play any video game out there.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; TIP OF THE WEEK &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
The attack of the Melissa virus this week really brought home the
dangers that can lurk in e-mail attachments. ``Don't ever open an
unsolicited attachment'' is the '90s version of the old adage about
not accepting rides from strangers. To protect your PC, consider
getting software such as Norton's AntiVirus or McAfee's VirusScan.
These programs, which you can get for under $30 with rebates, can
sniff out and eliminate most viruses. And the makers quickly post
online updates to handle new viruses that appear on the scene, like
Melissa. Free trial versions are available at www.norton.com and
www.mcafee.com.

ADVERTISING: IBM TAKES STAND FOR CONSUMER PRIVACY ON WEB 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Saying it hoped to ward off government regulation and increase
consumer confidence in electronic commerce, IBM Corp., the
second-biggest advertiser on the Internet, said Wednesday that it
would pull its ads from Web sites that lacked clear privacy
policies.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter sent to 350 Web sites it advertises with in the
United States and Canada, IBM said that as of June 1 it would
advertise only on sites that posted such policies.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement, thought to be the first by a U.S. company,
comes as the Federal Trade Commission, Congress and the European
Union are closely monitoring the effectiveness of efforts by online
businesses to police themselves on the issue of buying and selling
personal data they gather.
</P>
<P>
   IBM said its own recent survey had found that only 30 percent of
the 800 sites worldwide from which it buys ads had privacy policies
posted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a little to our surprise, frankly, that so many sites
didn't have privacy policies,'' said Abby Kohnstamm, IBM's senior
vice president for marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kohnstamm and Chris Caine, vice president for governmental
programs, cited three factors behind the decision announced
Wednesday: IBM's own history of protecting consumer privacy,
research showing that consumer concerns about privacy are
inhibiting the growth of electronic commerce, and the need for the
industry to prove that it can regulate itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Market-led policies need market leaders,'' Caine said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Pitofsky, the trade commission chairman, who last year
told Internet companies to make fundamental improvements in
protecting consumer privacy or face tough new regulations, said he
was encouraged by the announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is a good move,'' Pitofsky said. ``I'm not sure
whether it will catch on or not, but I think it is important that a
company with the stature and prestige of IBM take the first step.
Time will tell if others see it in their best interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Even privacy advocates who view industry self-regulation as
ineffective and unenforceable called the IBM move a positive step
in pushing companies to tell consumers what type of personal
information they collect and how it is used.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is exquisitely timed,'' said Jason Catlett, president of
Junkbusters Corp., which promotes consumer protection online. ``I
don't think it's going to have an enormous effect,'' he added, but
``I still feel I have to applaud IBM because their heart is in the
right place.''
</P>
<P>
   Catlett, saying that IBM had a good history of protecting
privacy, also pointed out that the company had avoided negative
publicity like that recently faced by Microsoft Corp. and Intel
Corp. for embedding in their products identifying numbers that
could allow marketers and others to track computer users' movements
through cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   All three companies are members of the Online Privacy Alliance,
which was formed last year to push companies to address privacy
concerns after a survey by the FTC found only 14 percent of Web
sites had clear privacy policies posted.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, the No. 1 advertiser on the Internet, applauded the
move by IBM and said it would watch its effects closely. ``Because
privacy is very important to us, we are always considering all ways
in which we can encourage privacy protections,'' said Tom Pilla, a
Microsoft spokesman. ``We don't have any immediate plans to follow
suit.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Although IBM will not dictate standards for what privacy
policies on Web sites should be, it does refer Web publishers to
the Online Privacy Alliance, which has a list of recommended
practices that are based on principles recommended by the FTC last
year.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over the issue has reached a critical point as the
FTC nears a decision on whether a report to Congress due this
spring will recommend the passage of new laws to protect online
privacy.
</P>
<P>
   A group of business interests, in conjunction with the FTC and
Georgetown University, recently completed a follow-up to the FTC
survey last year of online privacy practices. The results of that
study, which have not been released, are expected to be a
determining factor in the agency's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Pitofsky told Congress last year that he would push for
regulation if significant improvement was not found. He said
Wednesday that progress was being made, but he acknowledged, ``I
just don't know how much, and I hear radically different versions
from differing groups.''
</P>
<P>
   He also emphasized that the report to Congress would look at
more than just the numbers. ``You want to know what kind of
policy'' Web sites ``are putting up there,'' he said. Some key
points, he said, are whether the policies are clear and whether
they explain that consumers have a choice in how the information
they supply is used.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, IBM cited the new survey in the letter that its online
advertising agency, Ogilvy One Worldwide, a New York unit of WPP
Group PLC, sent out Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that this presents a very timely opportunity for
the private sector to continue to take the initiative in posting
and following privacy policies,'' the letter said in reference to
the survey. ``While the appropriate privacy statement will vary
from site to site, we strongly encourage Web site owners to employ
industry-best privacy practices.''
</P>
<P>
   IBM said it spent about $45 million on online advertising last
year, or 7 percent of its worldwide media budget. That is expected
to increase to $60 million, or 10 percent of its budget, this year.

TURNING IBSEN PLAY INTO FILM IS A FAMILY AFFAIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKLIN, N.Y. _ History doesn't say whether Henrik Ibsen spent
time in rural New York, but if he did _ if he passed along its
hilly roads in winter, squinting at the sun-illumined ice _ it
might have reminded him of Norway.
</P>
<P>
   And who knows? It might have inspired him. Holed up in a
clapboard house, bundled in wool and filled with the gloom of an
early dusk, he might have written ``Hedda Gabler.'' Few plays in
any language have so captured the suffocating horror of a false
life or the desperate lengths taken to escape it; few have trapped
their heroes in such wintry-cold, impenetrable cages. Ibsen knew
cages. Ibsen knew cold. And he certainly knew winter.
</P>
<P>
   So there was a touch of poetry in the ice around the eastern New
York community of Franklin, where a small clutch of cast and crew
were busy making a movie out of ``Hedda.''
</P>
<P>
   Tentatively called ``A Murder of Peacocks'' and set in the
1930s, the film was shot in a three-week blur back in January
taking over a Civil War-era, 20-odd-room Victorian manse owned by
Ken and Janice Stalter. Outside, a crowd of three dozen peacocks
minced about the yard, perching in trees and bristling imperiously
atop a tall barn roof.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the peacocks were dressed in velvet and lace.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, wearing a rust-colored gown and Constance Bennett
curls, was Hedda. The other, in lavender lace and a chocolate bob,
was Thea, a lovesick visitor and an unwitting target for Hedda's
abuse. The setting was an exquisitely appointed double parlor at
the front of the house; the scene was the passive-aggressive dance
that closes Act II.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't understand how poor I am, and fate has made you so
rich,'' said Hedda (Carmela Marner), and you could see the bile
forming in her belly.
</P>
<P>
   For those who haven't read the play since high school, it's like
this: Thea (Camilla Enders) is in love with a suffering writer
named Lovborg, who also happens to be an ex-flame of Hedda's. Hedda
is unhappily married to the decent, befuddled Tesman, who has just
carted off Lovborg to a debauch at Judge Brack's house. Thea is
worried about Lovborg; Hedda, penned in by her house, her loveless
marriage and her inability to move, decides to torture Thea. It's a
subtle, brutal scene in a subtle, brutal play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes across to me as an unbelievably modern play the way
it sort of strikes into an existential dilemma. It sounds pompous,
but I believe that,'' said David Bridel, the film's director (and
Marner's husband). The play, he said, ``goes to the heart of being
bored, the absolute terror of boredom and how it can drive you to
(insanity). It speaks of entrapment. ... Hedda is so bored and
looking so hard for something to entertain herself. And it all goes
terribly wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Bridel, a 30-year-old Londoner with cornflower-blue eyes and a
gentle manner, was first approached to direct the play on stage for
the Franklin Stock Company's 1997 summer season. ``I knew the play,
and I hated it. I'd seen productions, and I'd hated them,'' he
said. ``But then I read it, and I got a little more fond of it, and
it became not an obsession, but I do love it very much now.''
</P>
<P>
   That initial stage production, which re-imagined Ibsen's play as
a bitterly funny battle between Davis-and-Crawford bombshells, drew
packed houses and sparked such positive responses that all involved
decided to take a crack at a film version. Bridel and most of the
cast returned, as did the Franklin Stock Company's artistic
directors, Carole Lucia Satrina and Eugene Marner as producers and
co-directors, with Marner tripling as cinematographer and Satrina
wearing an extra hat as script supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   The pair are partners in filmmaking as well as marriage, having
shot numerous nonfiction works for the networks and PBS, among them
the Emmy-winning ``Creativity'' with Bill Moyers. They've lived in
Franklin off-and-on since 1971, so they're hardly Hollywood
outsiders. They're locals.
</P>
<P>
   And if ``Peacocks'' is starting to look like a family affair,
well, it is: Everyone knows everyone, and if they aren't related,
they're friends. Eugene and Carole are Carmela's parents. David is
their son-in-law. Carmela and Camilla have been chums since high
school, and Carmela has known David Conrad, who plays Lovborg,
since their days at Brown. Ray Bokhour, who plays Tesman, and Lolly
Susi, who plays the housekeeper, met Carmela and her husband at
London's Central School of Speech and Drama. Friends, all of them.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere on the set was easygoing, un-Hollywood, low on
stress and strutting. There was also a notable lack of ostentation,
not surprising for a $15,000 movie with a cast of seven and a crew
of not much more. Everyone in the film has a Screen Actors Guild
card, but no one's getting paid not until ``Peacocks'' does the
festival circuit and gets picked up (they hope) by a distributor.
So no Winnebagos. No bodyguards. No high-end caterers. Just bagels
and chips and help yourself to coffee.
</P>
<P>
   Costume changes? In the bathroom. Makeup? At the kitchen table.
Need to put your mug down? Shove aside that mound of base and
lipstick over there, by the tissues, next to the spools of thread.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the production it's like being at home,'' said the
play's Judge Brack, Charles Reiman, a carpenter-cum-actor who lives
in nearby Oneonta. ``It's like a home I didn't know existed. It's
like family.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not at all a heavy production,'' said Satrina,
referring to both the set and the script itself. When told that
another producer had likened making a film to surviving a war, she
replied with a robust shake of the head.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not war,'' she said. ``This has been really lovely.''

FROM INDIANA WITH LOVE: SERVICE THE OLD-FASHIONED WAY 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Ours is a long and thriving business
relationship that involves no faxing, no e-mail, no Web sites, no
FedEx, not even a credit card.
</P>
<P>
   Three or four times a year, I pick up the telephone and dial a
number 2,000 miles away in Terre Haute, Ind. At the other end, Pat
Dowell (or his mom Lois or brother Mike) answers. We go through a
familiar ritual.
</P>
<P>
   I say I want to send flowers or a potted plant to one of my
parents for a birthday or other special occasion. I ask Pat what's
in bloom and looking pretty around his nursery. He runs through the
options.
</P>
<P>
   Hyacinths? Tulips? Daffodils? Maybe some ``awful nice yellow
roses'' that just came in that morning?
</P>
<P>
   I make a selection _ Pat knows my price range _ and tell him
what I want on the card.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll drop 'em off at your folks' house on my way home,'' he
usually says.
</P>
<P>
   Pat lives about five blocks from my mother and father in the
same subdivision where I grew up. (I always liked riding my bike
down Pat's street because it was flat and I could let go of the
handlebars and coast.) Although it is no longer a community where
people leave their doors unlocked at night, it's still safe enough
to leave a plant or some flowers on someone's front door stoop.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of asking for my Visa number, Pat always double checks
my address so he can send me a bill in the mail. I send the bill
and a check back through the mail. The whole transaction takes
maybe 10 days or two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine. Handwritten bills, personal checks and snail mail? In
this era when everything absolutely, positively has to be somewhere
overnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``My brother and I were just talking about that the other day,''
Pat said last week. (Daffodils for Mom's 69th birthday.) ``You
know, the gas company doesn't do business like this. You can't call
up and order some electricity or go get groceries at Kroger and
say, `Oh, just send me a bill.' It doesn't work that way anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   I'd like to think that, somewhere, John Jacob Schmidt and his
descendants are smiling at this situation. A German immigrant to
Indiana in the mid-1800s, he Anglicized his surname to establish
the J.J. Smith florist and nursery in Terre Haute in 1882.
</P>
<P>
   ``He already owned the biggest fruit and vegetable business in
Indiana,'' Pat Dowell said. ``The flower shop was started to give
his wife and daughters something to do. It was basically a toy.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the toy _ and the Smiths' lovely white Victorian
house next door _ are all that survive of the once-wealthy clan.
</P>
<P>
   Because ``hardly any of 'em got married,'' a person must go out
to Highland Lawn cemetery to visit the Smith family. Pat Dowell's
dad Bill co-inherited the nursery from the last surviving Smith _
``Aunt Gussie'' _ in 1970. Lois bought out the partner in 1984 when
Bill died.
</P>
<P>
   The flower business _ like everything else _ has changed since
Pat helped out in the shop as a kid, but the Dowells can't imagine
doing anything else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up in this place,'' Pat said. ``It's in our blood.''
</P>
<P>
   In most business transactions today, that probably doesn't mean
a whole lot to people. Certainly not compared to ``How much will it
cost?'' and ``How soon can you do it?''
</P>
<P>
   But when you live 2,000 miles from the people you love most in
life, it means a great deal _ especially when you want to reach
across the miles and put your arms around them.
</P>
<P>
   If you're really, really lucky, you find surrogate huggers like
the Dowells, folks with tulips and roses in their blood.
</P>
<P>
   Folks who still take the time to gather and arrange beauty and
know which front stoop to drop it off on when they head for home.

representative DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at

 For release: Wed., April 7 or thereafter  
 By GERALDINE A. FERRARO  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It's no surprise when first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton delivers
a fantastic speech, as I heard her do recently in New York. Even
without the hype of a potential Senate run, she draws an
enthusiastic crowd. She's known as a dynamic speaker, and she never
fails to deliver.
 &HT;    But what are the odds that, only four days later, I'd hear at
least as good a speech from one of the most notoriously boring
public speakers in America, former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley?
 &HT;    It was the largest gathering of alumni of Fordham Law School
since John F. Kennedy addressed the group _ far larger, I must
admit, than I've ever drawn when I spoke there, and I'm an alumna!
 &HT;    The audience that came out to hear the former senator was
predominantly male _ Fordham Law's entering class will be 48
percent women, but it's taken us time to get there. It was also
predominantly Catholic and Republican, predominantly successful
business people.
 &HT;    Not exactly the rousing, cheering type of crowd, in short,
especially for a candidate for the Democratic presidential
nomination.
 &HT;    And only one local cable station and one tabloid newspaper had
bothered to cover the event. I guess the others figured they
wouldn't miss much _ just another boring campaign speech from a
famously boring speaker.
 &HT;    Well, they were wrong.
 &HT;    Now, admittedly I hadn't heard Bradley deliver a speech for
several years, but it's quite a contrast. The man who as a
basketball player was nicknamed ``Dollar Bill'' for his
dependability and as a politician was nicknamed ``Duller Bill'' for
his flatness has finally figured out how to put himself over with
audiences.
 &HT;    For one thing, he isn't afraid to admit that he used to play
some ball. No so long ago an introduction like he received at
Fordham _ 10 minutes about his basketball career and the leadership
qualities he showed then (I didn't know he was captain of the
gold-medal Olympic team in 1960!) and one very short sentence
covering his 18 years in the Senate _ would have put Bradley on the
defensive.
 &HT;    This time he didn't squirm, though. Apparently no longer needing
to prove he isn't just a jock who got lucky and was elected to the
Senate, he went with the flow.
 &HT;    I could relate. When I was a young attorney, I worried that
people would dismiss me, not take me seriously, if I looked pretty.
I bristled when people commented on how I looked, rather than on
what I said.
 &HT;    But 20 years as a congresswoman, as an ambassador and as a
partner in a law firm gradually convinced me that people are paying
attention to what I am saying and doing, not what I'm wearing.
 &HT;    Over time, I've come to realize that my insecurity was a
frivolous concern. Getting older helped, too!
 &HT;    That may be what's happened with Bradley. He's mellowed and fits
comfortably in his skin. That was apparent in his response to his
introduction, but even more so in the speech that followed.
 &HT;    This was a whole new Bill Bradley. He appealed to the best in
his audience. He was funny and engaging, with a message that was
not only current and intelligent but also uplifting.
 &HT;    Most of all, he found the connection with his audience. He came
across as one of them, telling them that it's OK to want to make
money, it's even OK to complain occasionally about government laws.
But, while you're at it, think of those less fortunate. They need
your help.
 &HT;    Take it from someone who's made a few speeches in my time, it
was a heck of a speech.
 &HT;    But even more intriguing than Bradley's improved delivery was
the reaction of his audience. From my vantage point on the dais, it
was like watching a group of starstruck kids.
 &HT;    Maybe it's a male thing. Men really connect with Bradley. I've
seen it in my own family: When my husband and I were invited to a
party celebrating Bradley's new book, my husband immediately
accepted, bought the book and had it autographed to my son. At
Christmas he gave it to John Jr. _ just as John Jr. was handing him
the same gift.
 &HT;    At a dinner party recently, when the talk got around to
presidential politics, the men started waxing poetic about Bradley.
Just last Sunday, an old friend enthused, ``I'm a Republican, but
he's a candidate I would cross over to vote for.''
 &HT;    Well, the Fordham speech was more of the same, male bonding from
the minute the introduction started. Not only did they want to see
Bradley, though, they wanted to hear him. They listened attentively
to everything he had to say.
 &HT;    And then they gave him a standing ovation.
 &HT;    As a Democrat, I've always delighted in the Republicans'
problems with their gender gap. But, though we don't admit it too
often, Democrats have a gender gap, too. Women vote for our
candidates disproportionately, but men vote against them
disproportionately.
 &HT;    And maybe that's where Bill Bradley comes in. He can get men to
listen when he admonishes them, ``Whether you're a Republican or
Democrat, stay engaged.''
 &HT;    That is the key to a civil society. It's not a new message. But
it's a new and different messenger.
 &HT;    Keep listening.
 &HT;    (Geraldine A. Ferraro, a former congresswoman and the Democratic
nominee for vice president in 1984, is a Manhattan-based
attorney.)

<P>
   On Nov. 16, 1995, Lt. Gen. Wesley Clark sat in Dayton, Ohio,
inside a PowerScene virtual-reality imaging system, using a
joystick to fly back and forth through simulated three-dimensional
scenes of the hills of Bosnia east of Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
   At about 11 p.m., Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic had
joined him, as well as some other U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
   Lubricated by Scotch, Milosevic and the Americans zoomed back
and forth on the computer simulation to try to carve out a path
from the besieged Bosnian capital to Gorazde, a U.N. ``safe area''
surrounded by Bosnian Serbs. In the wee hours of the morning, Clark
used crayons to draw a corridor from Sarajevo to Gorazde that was
not hopelessly indefensible.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic shook hands with Clark, who is now the supreme allied
commander in Europe, and Richard C. Holbrooke, the main American
peace negotiator, and what is variously known as the Clark Corridor
or the Scotch Road was born.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, the United States had shifted from a determination not
to be dragged into the Balkans to using U.S. officials and
computers to draw Bosnia's new frontiers. Winston Churchill used to
brag about having drawn Jordan's borders on a map one afternoon;
the American general could say much the same thing about Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   But America's entry lacked swagger. Rather, U.S. policymakers
came to sketch the Scotch Road with a profound sense of
ambivalence.
</P>
<P>
   Documents relating to this diplomacy _ including Holbrooke's
memoir ``To End a War'' and the State Department's 1996 official
study of the process leading to the Dayton Accords of November 1995
_ show that American officials were painfully aware of the
shortcomings of U.S. Bosnia policy and the distance it had shifted
from the goals that Bill Clinton had espoused in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Dayton was a vast improvement over the muddle and
bloodshed that preceded it. But it was oversold.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton represented not the vindication of the liberal ideals
with which Clinton excoriated George Bush on the 1992 campaign
trail _ firm action to halt genocide, bringing war criminals to
justice, tolerance, multiethnic nation-states, liberal nationalism
and the use of international and European institutions _ but rather
a version of the chilly realpolitik that kept the Bush
administration out of Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   The deal the Clinton team helped cut edged ominously close to
partition, writing an epitaph for Bosnia as a multiethnic state and
ceding much of its territory to the Bosnian Serbs. Many of Dayton's
better provisions, especially the prosecution of war criminals and
the return of refugees, remain largely unimplemented.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, Dayton required dealing with and ultimately strengthening
Milosevic and Croatian President Franjo Tudjman, two ethnic
nationalists whose ideology and ruthlessness are antithetical to
liberal values.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton's lessons are grimly appropriate when considering the
violence in Kosovo, where Milosevic's demagoguery helped set off
the demise of Yugoslavia and which now is the latest target of his
tragic ethnic cleansing.
</P>
<P>
   The bloodshed in Kosovo is a symptom of the approach that
strengthened Milosevic and Tudjman. By doing so, Dayton plunged
Serbia deeper into ethnic chauvinism, whereby the ``sacred Serb
soil'' of Kosovo matters vastly more to Belgrade than do the
Albanians who lived there. As such, the Kosovo crisis comes as
scant surprise.
</P>
<P>
   While the theater has shifted, and while Kosovo is part of
Serbia proper, the underlying questions are much the same. As in
1993, the Clinton administration found itself faced with a
fundamental choice. Would the United States push Milosevic to
respect autonomy, the rights of minorities and the rule of law, or
would it retreat, as it did for two years in Bosnia, by saying that
getting involved was not worth American blood?
</P>
<P>
   To win any accord in Bosnia in 1995 was not easy; Dayton took
considerable diplomatic skill and tenacity. Congress' isolationists
proved unhelpful and irresponsible, and the administration ran huge
political risks by deciding to intervene. But it ran those risks
for a reluctant realism.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the very policies that the administration balked at
in May 1993 _ using military force and firm leadership of the
Europeans _ were the ones that stopped the war in the autumn of
1995. According to Warren Zimmermann, the last U.S. ambassador to
Yugoslavia, the cost of delay was more than 100,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the fuller our picture of the Dayton situation becomes, the
clearer it is that the Dayton process _ its accomplishments
notwithstanding _ is less a how-to manual for peacemakers than a
cautionary tale.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the Clinton administration inherited a mess. Its
Republican predecessors were consummate realists. After meeting
Milosevic in Belgrade in June 1991 to warn him against
``exploitation of ethnic resentments (and) failure to respect human
rights in Kosovo'' _ complaints that could be lifted from later
headlines _ Secretary of State James A. Baker III felt he ``was
talking to a wall with a crew cut.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush administration greeted Yugoslav intransigence with a
shrug. Its basic _ and correct _ diplomatic calculus was that only
military force would deter the ambitions of Milosevic and Tudjman.
Its basic _ and incorrect _ political calculus was that such an
intervention could never be sold to the American people.
</P>
<P>
   That assessment was shaded by Bush's determination not to try.
National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft said that the president
would frequently ask him, ``Tell me again what this is all about.''
He saw no U.S. interests engaged in Bosnia, and his European allies
reinforced his skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once in, where does it end?'' asked then British Prime
Minister John Major. Instead, the Bush administration treated
Bosnia as if its woes were the result of a famine or an earthquake
rather than an act of aggression.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line, as Baker put it, was that the costs in
casualties ``would have been staggering ... the necessary support
by the American people for the degree of force that would have been
required in Bosnia could never have been built or maintained.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, on the other hand, promised a very different policy on
the campaign trail. ``I know that ethnic divisions are one of the
strongest impulses in all of society all over the world,'' he said,
``but we've got to take a stand against it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush administration, he charged, was immoral ``for turning
its back on violations of basic human rights,'' and needed to show
``real leadership.'' When the Clinton administration dithered,
unlike the Bush administration, it did so in defiance of its
promises.
</P>
<P>
   The Bosnian war could well have been ended in May 1993 had the
president fulfilled his campaign pledge to lift the arms embargo on
the Bosnians and launch air strikes on the Serbs. At that time,
Clinton sent Secretary of State Warren Christopher to sound out the
Europeans about lift and strike.
</P>
<P>
   But Christopher was instructed to consult, not to lead, and what
he heard was across-the-board opposition, concern for European
soldiers in the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR), distaste for
supposed American arrogance and warnings that NATO might sunder.
</P>
<P>
   At a pivotal briefing in the Roosevelt Room the morning of his
return, Christopher told Clinton that lift and strike was still
viable, but that it would require, as he put it, a ``raw power
approach'': telling the Europeans ``that we have firmly decided to
go ahead with our preferred option and that we expect them to
support us.''
</P>
<P>
   Of all the choices, Christopher explained, the least attractive
_ and most hypocritical _ would be to continue the Bush policy of
``doing nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton blanched.
</P>
<P>
   Why, then, did Clinton ultimately act decisively, backing
heretofore toothless diplomacy with force and American leadership?
Alas, the answer to this puzzle lies in a startling decision _ or,
better, a nondecision _ that no administration should repeat.
</P>
<P>
   By the time of the August 1995 decision to push for Holbrooke's
shuttle, without being fully aware of it, Washington had already
committed itself to a military presence in Bosnia. The decision was
made in so aimless a manner that almost all senior officials were
caught off-guard when the implications of what they had done
finally sank in.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department's Bosnia study confirms that most senior
foreign-policy officials, most notably the president himself, were
surprised to learn in June 1995 that U.S. troops might soon be on
their way to Bosnia whether the administration liked it or not.
</P>
<P>
   The confusion stemmed from an earlier presidential decision
that, should the situation on the ground become chaotic enough to
prevent UNPROFOR _ the hapless U.N. peacekeeping mission already in
Bosnia _ from functioning, NATO would intervene to help the blue
helmets flee.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration confirmed this commitment in late
1994, and NATO military planners duly began work on Op-plan 40104,
which called for using 20,000 U.S. troops as part of a
60,000-person evacuation force.
</P>
<P>
   When NATO approved this mission in the spring of 1995 with the
consent of American NATO Amb. Robert E. Hunter and U.S. military
planners in Brussels, the Clinton administration boxed itself in.
While an intervention to limit U.N. failure would be dangerous and
humiliating, the White House figured that reneging on its promise
to NATO would destroy the remains of its credibility and devastate
an already frayed alliance.
</P>
<P>
   With the U.N. peacekeeping force daily revealed to be impotent,
the only way Washington would be able to forestall the withdrawal
mission to which it had committed itself was to push the parties to
peace _ a better option, but one that would still require sending
American troops to Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   What one Clinton adviser called ``the single most difficult
decision of (Clinton's) presidency _ to send troops to Bosnia'' had
been made without anyone realizing it.
</P>
<P>
   As the war worsened, the specter of Op-plan 40104 loomed larger.
The Serb massacres of thousands of Bosnian Muslims in July 1995 in
the ``safe areas'' of Srebrenica and Zepa made the U.N.
peacekeeping mission's ignominy complete.
</P>
<P>
   European countries participating in UNPROFOR began warning that
they would soon pull their troops out, triggering what American
policymakers referred to as the 40104 ``doomsday machine'' _
intervention triggered by humiliation.
</P>
<P>
   Several senior officials, including then U.N. Amb. Madeleine K.
Albright and National Security Adviser Anthony Lake, began arguing
that since American troops were headed for Bosnia anyway, the
administration should try to implement a success rather than ratify
a failure.
</P>
<P>
   As one official memorably put it, the question on Bosnia was not
whether to stay in or out; it was ``choosing which waterfall we
will go over.''
</P>
<P>
   Driven mainly by Lake and the National Security Council staff,
senior officials spent the rest of the summer scurrying to come up
with a plan. In August, Holbrooke's mission began.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration's decision to reevaluate its Bosnia
diplomacy came not from a realization of the failure of its earlier
rudderlessness. Rather, it came from a decision few could even
remember making.
</P>
<P>
   When apprised of the details of Op-plan 40104, everyone _ from
Holbrooke to Christopher to Clinton himself _ was shocked. The
choice to commit U.S. troops to help withdraw the U.N. peacekeepers
had not been the fruit of any formal deliberative process in which
the president approved the mission through such standard means as a
decision memorandum.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, it was made by inertia.
</P>
<P>
   And the Dayton accord, which emerged from the haphazard process
triggered by Op-plan 40104, as Holbrooke himself conceded, was
hardly perfect. To be sure, it stopped the fighting _ which should
not be underappreciated.
</P>
<P>
   But what is left of Bosnia are the tatters of a tolerant,
cosmopolitan society. Ultimately, in that war, the West lacked the
will to reverse Serb and Croat aggression, and the Bosnian-Serb
obsession with self-rule was ratified.

<P>
   On Nov. 16, 1995, Lt. Gen. Wesley Clark sat in Dayton, Ohio,
inside a PowerScene virtual-reality imaging system, using a
joystick to fly back and forth through simulated three-dimensional
scenes of the hills of Bosnia east of Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
   At about 11 p.m., Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic had
joined him, as well as some other U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
   Lubricated by Scotch, Milosevic and the Americans zoomed back
and forth on the computer simulation to try to carve out a path
from the besieged Bosnian capital to Gorazde, a U.N. ``safe area''
surrounded by Bosnian Serbs. In the wee hours of the morning, Clark
used crayons to draw a corridor from Sarajevo to Gorazde that was
not hopelessly indefensible.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic shook hands with Clark, who is now the supreme allied
commander in Europe, and Richard C. Holbrooke, the main American
peace negotiator, and what is variously known as the Clark Corridor
or the Scotch Road was born.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, the United States had shifted from a determination not
to be dragged into the Balkans to using U.S. officials and
computers to draw Bosnia's new frontiers. Winston Churchill used to
brag about having drawn Jordan's borders on a map one afternoon;
the American general could say much the same thing about Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   But America's entry lacked swagger. Rather, U.S. policymakers
came to sketch the Scotch Road with a profound sense of
ambivalence.
</P>
<P>
   Documents relating to this diplomacy _ including Holbrooke's
memoir ``To End a War'' and the State Department's 1996 official
study of the process leading to the Dayton Accords of November 1995
_ show that American officials were painfully aware of the
shortcomings of U.S. Bosnia policy and the distance it had shifted
from the goals that Bill Clinton had espoused in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Dayton was a vast improvement over the muddle and
bloodshed that preceded it. But it was oversold.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton represented not the vindication of the liberal ideals
with which Clinton excoriated George Bush on the 1992 campaign
trail _ firm action to halt genocide, bringing war criminals to
justice, tolerance, multiethnic nation-states, liberal nationalism
and the use of international and European institutions _ but rather
a version of the chilly realpolitik that kept the Bush
administration out of Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   The deal the Clinton team helped cut edged ominously close to
partition, writing an epitaph for Bosnia as a multiethnic state and
ceding much of its territory to the Bosnian Serbs. Many of Dayton's
better provisions, especially the prosecution of war criminals and
the return of refugees, remain largely unimplemented.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, Dayton required dealing with and ultimately strengthening
Milosevic and Croatian President Franjo Tudjman, two ethnic
nationalists whose ideology and ruthlessness are antithetical to
liberal values.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton's lessons are grimly appropriate when considering the
violence in Kosovo, where Milosevic's demagoguery helped set off
the demise of Yugoslavia and which now is the latest target of his
tragic ethnic cleansing.
</P>
<P>
   The bloodshed in Kosovo is a symptom of the approach that
strengthened Milosevic and Tudjman. By doing so, Dayton plunged
Serbia deeper into ethnic chauvinism, whereby the ``sacred Serb
soil'' of Kosovo matters vastly more to Belgrade than do the
Albanians who lived there. As such, the Kosovo crisis comes as
scant surprise.
</P>
<P>
   While the theater has shifted, and while Kosovo is part of
Serbia proper, the underlying questions are much the same. As in
1993, the Clinton administration found itself faced with a
fundamental choice. Would the United States push Milosevic to
respect autonomy, the rights of minorities and the rule of law, or
would it retreat, as it did for two years in Bosnia, by saying that
getting involved was not worth American blood?
</P>
<P>
   To win any accord in Bosnia in 1995 was not easy; Dayton took
considerable diplomatic skill and tenacity. Congress' isolationists
proved unhelpful and irresponsible, and the administration ran huge
political risks by deciding to intervene. But it ran those risks
for a reluctant realism.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the very policies that the administration balked at
in May 1993 _ using military force and firm leadership of the
Europeans _ were the ones that stopped the war in the autumn of
1995. According to Warren Zimmermann, the last U.S. ambassador to
Yugoslavia, the cost of delay was more than 100,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the fuller our picture of the Dayton situation becomes, the
clearer it is that the Dayton process _ its accomplishments
notwithstanding _ is less a how-to manual for peacemakers than a
cautionary tale.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the Clinton administration inherited a mess. Its
Republican predecessors were consummate realists. After meeting
Milosevic in Belgrade in June 1991 to warn him against
``exploitation of ethnic resentments (and) failure to respect human
rights in Kosovo'' _ complaints that could be lifted from later
headlines _ Secretary of State James A. Baker III felt he ``was
talking to a wall with a crew cut.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush administration greeted Yugoslav intransigence with a
shrug. Its basic _ and correct _ diplomatic calculus was that only
military force would deter the ambitions of Milosevic and Tudjman.
Its basic _ and incorrect _ political calculus was that such an
intervention could never be sold to the American people.
</P>
<P>
   That assessment was shaded by Bush's determination not to try.
National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft said that the president
would frequently ask him, ``Tell me again what this is all about.''
He saw no U.S. interests engaged in Bosnia, and his European allies
reinforced his skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once in, where does it end?'' asked then British Prime
Minister John Major. Instead, the Bush administration treated
Bosnia as if its woes were the result of a famine or an earthquake
rather than an act of aggression.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line, as Baker put it, was that the costs in
casualties ``would have been staggering ... the necessary support
by the American people for the degree of force that would have been
required in Bosnia could never have been built or maintained.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, on the other hand, promised a very different policy on
the campaign trail. ``I know that ethnic divisions are one of the
strongest impulses in all of society all over the world,'' he said,
``but we've got to take a stand against it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush administration, he charged, was immoral ``for turning
its back on violations of basic human rights,'' and needed to show
``real leadership.'' When the Clinton administration dithered,
unlike the Bush administration, it did so in defiance of its
promises.
</P>
<P>
   The Bosnian war could well have been ended in May 1993 had the
president fulfilled his campaign pledge to lift the arms embargo on
the Bosnians and launch air strikes on the Serbs. At that time,
Clinton sent Secretary of State Warren Christopher to sound out the
Europeans about lift and strike.
</P>
<P>
   But Christopher was instructed to consult, not to lead, and what
he heard was across-the-board opposition, concern for European
soldiers in the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR), distaste for
supposed American arrogance and warnings that NATO might sunder.
</P>
<P>
   At a pivotal briefing in the Roosevelt Room the morning of his
return, Christopher told Clinton that lift and strike was still
viable, but that it would require, as he put it, a ``raw power
approach'': telling the Europeans ``that we have firmly decided to
go ahead with our preferred option and that we expect them to
support us.''
</P>
<P>
   Of all the choices, Christopher explained, the least attractive
_ and most hypocritical _ would be to continue the Bush policy of
``doing nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton blanched.
</P>
<P>
   Why, then, did Clinton ultimately act decisively, backing
heretofore toothless diplomacy with force and American leadership?
Alas, the answer to this puzzle lies in a startling decision _ or,
better, a nondecision _ that no administration should repeat.

 c.1999 Foreign Affairs Magazine  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   The United States, other governments and international
organizations such as NATO are increasingly being called upon to
influence, intervene or broker solutions to conflicts within
states, triggered by ethnic or cultural differences.
</P>
<P>
   Often these conflicts pose a substantial threat to global peace
and human life.
</P>
<P>
   All over the world, after the rush of post-Cold War secessions,
dissatisfied groups are emboldened to seek independence. Many have
decided that wars of national liberation are more likely to garner
meaningful outside support than low-key appeals for minority rights
or autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   A more clearly formulated set of international norms may
discourage at least some of the more questionable claims and the
violence that so often accompanies them.
</P>
<P>
   Such norms are not likely to satisfy partisans who extol the
virtues of yesterday's ``national'' identity. Even so, recognizing
and accommodating opposing rights is the only way the world can
respond to clashing demands in a politically and morally principled
manner.
</P>
<P>
   When responding to claims of self-determination, protecting
basic human rights should be the foremost goal. Guidelines for
decision-making must be clearly articulated so that responses can
be defended against charges of selectivity and hypocrisy.
</P>
<P>
   Human-rights norms are widely accepted and give legitimacy to
American and U.N.-based actions. Not only are humanitarian ideals
broadly supported and understood by the public, but U.S. law
requires that human rights be a primary foreign-policy concern.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, a basic factor in formulating responses should be whether
or not a particular action is likely to promote the rights of all
the people. Cultural, linguistic and religious rights must be
respected, and neither minority nor majority should seek to impose
its values on the other.
</P>
<P>
   In many instances, this requires the guarantee of individual
rights to free expression, assembly, association and religion. In
other cases, innovative solutions _ affirmative action, government
representation, devolution of powers or support for ethnic cultures
_ must be devised to make equality in fact match equality in law.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is also important to reject the notion that every
ethnically or culturally distinct people, nation or group has an
automatic right to its own state _ or that ethnically homogeneous
states are desirable. For in an environment where human rights are
respected, a global system of states based on ethnicity or
historical claims is clearly unachievable.
</P>
<P>
   There will always be ``trapped'' minorities, no matter how
carefully boundaries are drawn, except in the smallest or most
isolated environments. Ethnically based states almost inevitably
lead to claims of ethnic superiority from the new majority and a
cultural rigidity that creates problems for new minorities. At
their very worst, newly created ethnic states may tolerate or
encourage killings and ethnic cleansing.
</P>
<P>
   In a new nation, a majority population need not ignore its
culture or the requirements of a modern state. Some
``state-building'' _ for example, with respect to language or a
common legal system _ may be necessary to develop the
administrative and economic ties that bind communities together.
</P>
<P>
   Cultural or ethnic minorities in a particular territory must
accept their minority status and not expect their beliefs and
customs to be reflected at the national level to the same extent as
those of the majority population.
</P>
<P>
   But this doesn't mean that a minority need submit to a majority
that seeks to destroy cultures that deviate from the dominant
model.
</P>
<P>
   In general, it is wise to reject the notion that there is a
legal right of secession. This principle will properly force
nationalists to abandon their claim that ``we are a nation and
therefore have a right to a state.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, central governments should no longer be
allowed to hide behind the facade of national unity without
explaining how minority rights are genuinely being protected.
</P>
<P>
   In what instances should secession be supported by the
international community?
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; When massive human-rights violations, approaching the scale
of genocide, are being perpetrated. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   If there is no likelihood of change in the attitude of the
central government, or if the majority population supports the
repression, secession may be the only effective remedy for the
besieged group. Although support for secession raises serious
issues regarding possible outside intervention, it is justifiable
if the underlying abuses are sufficiently grave.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; When reasonable demands for local self-government or minority
rights have been arbitrarily rejected by a central government, even
without large-scale violence. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   This exception, however, would come into play only when minimal
demands are rejected. It does not mean that the United States or
the United Nations should substitute their judgment of what is fair
or politically reasonable for that of the parties involved.
</P>
<P>
   According to the 1992 U.N. General Assembly declaration on
minority rights, states must ``protect the existence'' of
minorities, granting the latter the right ``to participate
effectively in cultural, religious, social, economic and public
life.'' However, it neither mandates the scope of that
participation nor grants minorities a veto over all actions that
might affect them.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and others should encourage the resolution of
claims to self-determination by means short of secession, except
when the parties agree to the division of a state. Statehood is not
necessary, however, to guarantee the legitimate rights of groups
and individuals to protect and promote their culture, language,
traditions and rights.
</P>
<P>
   The fulfillment of goals such as increased political and
economic power is more legitimately sought through the normal
democratic process. Potential mediators and advisers will need to
become familiar with a host of arrangements such as power-sharing,
devolution, federalism, confederation, territorial and functional
autonomy, self-government and special participation rights for
minorities or regional groups.
</P>
<P>
   To ensure equity, minorities in a new state that was founded to
preserve ethnic or cultural homogeneity should be granted the same
rights of self-determination that were asserted by the majority
population. Legitimate self-determination can only be exercised on
the basis of the consent of all involved parties, not just those
who wish to separate.
</P>
<P>
   If neither international law nor politics offers a mechanism
through which minorities trapped within a new ethnic state may
rejoin their former state or, at least, create an autonomous region
within their new home, rejection of the new borders by force may be
seen as the only alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Put simply, redressing historical grievances or responding to
contemporary dissatisfactions cannot justify the dispossession of
members of ethnic minorities who now live in the territory in
question and whose ancestors may have lived there for generations.
No group can claim exclusive control over a territory forever.
</P>
<P>
   It is morally impossible to decide which individuals should be
forced to choose between emigrating or remaining under ``alien''
domination and which other groups should be rewarded with
ethnically based political power in the form of a new state.
</P>
<P>
   If our concern is with peoples rather than territories, there is
no reason to regard existing administrative or ``republic''
boundaries within states as sacrosanct. In most cases, the best way
to determine the wishes of those in a new state would be through a
series of plebiscites to redraw what were formerly internal
boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   These should not be used in haste or to create enclaves that are
not viable. A peaceful acceptance of the possibility of altering
borders might be a useful precondition for recognition of a new
state whenever much of the population appears at odds with the new
borders.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, when armed conflict does occur, responsibility for war
crimes and crimes against humanity must be distinguished from the
underlying political agendas of all sides.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and others should continue to support
international accountability for such war criminals, even if the
problems of the prosecutions are only too evident from the halting
work of the ongoing U.N. tribunals on Rwanda and the former
Yugoslavia.

<P>
   The United States, other governments and international
organizations such as NATO are increasingly being called upon to
influence, intervene or broker solutions to conflicts within
states, triggered by ethnic or cultural differences.
</P>
<P>
   Often these conflicts pose a substantial threat to global peace
and human life.
</P>
<P>
   All over the world, after the rush of post-Cold War secessions,
dissatisfied groups are emboldened to seek independence. Many have
decided that wars of national liberation are more likely to garner
meaningful outside support than low-key appeals for minority rights
or autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   A more clearly formulated set of international norms may
discourage at least some of the more questionable claims and the
violence that so often accompanies them.
</P>
<P>
   Such norms are not likely to satisfy partisans who extol the
virtues of yesterday's ``national'' identity. Even so, recognizing
and accommodating opposing rights is the only way the world can
respond to clashing demands in a politically and morally principled
manner.
</P>
<P>
   When responding to claims of self-determination, protecting
basic human rights should be the foremost goal. Guidelines for
decision-making must be clearly articulated so that responses can
be defended against charges of selectivity and hypocrisy.
</P>
<P>
   Human-rights norms are widely accepted and give legitimacy to
American and U.N.-based actions. Not only are humanitarian ideals
broadly supported and understood by the public, but U.S. law
requires that human rights be a primary foreign-policy concern.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, a basic factor in formulating responses should be whether
or not a particular action is likely to promote the rights of all
the people. Cultural, linguistic and religious rights must be
respected, and neither minority nor majority should seek to impose
its values on the other.
</P>
<P>
   In many instances, this requires the guarantee of individual
rights to free expression, assembly, association and religion. In
other cases, innovative solutions _ affirmative action, government
representation, devolution of powers or support for ethnic cultures
_ must be devised to make equality in fact match equality in law.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is also important to reject the notion that every
ethnically or culturally distinct people, nation or group has an
automatic right to its own state _ or that ethnically homogeneous
states are desirable. For in an environment where human rights are
respected, a global system of states based on ethnicity or
historical claims is clearly unachievable.
</P>
<P>
   There will always be ``trapped'' minorities, no matter how
carefully boundaries are drawn, except in the smallest or most
isolated environments. Ethnically based states almost inevitably
lead to claims of ethnic superiority from the new majority and a
cultural rigidity that creates problems for new minorities. At
their very worst, newly created ethnic states may tolerate or
encourage killings and ethnic cleansing.
</P>
<P>
   In a new nation, a majority population need not ignore its
culture or the requirements of a modern state. Some
``state-building'' _ for example, with respect to language or a
common legal system _ may be necessary to develop the
administrative and economic ties that bind communities together.
</P>
<P>
   Cultural or ethnic minorities in a particular territory must
accept their minority status and not expect their beliefs and
customs to be reflected at the national level to the same extent as
those of the majority population.
</P>
<P>
   But this doesn't mean that a minority need submit to a majority
that seeks to destroy cultures that deviate from the dominant
model.
</P>
<P>
   In general, it is wise to reject the notion that there is a
legal right of secession. This principle will properly force
nationalists to abandon their claim that ``we are a nation and
therefore have a right to a state.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, central governments should no longer be
allowed to hide behind the facade of national unity without
explaining how minority rights are genuinely being protected.
</P>
<P>
   In what instances should secession be supported by the
international community?
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; When massive human-rights violations, approaching the scale
of genocide, are being perpetrated. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   If there is no likelihood of change in the attitude of the
central government, or if the majority population supports the
repression, secession may be the only effective remedy for the
besieged group. Although support for secession raises serious
issues regarding possible outside intervention, it is justifiable
if the underlying abuses are sufficiently grave.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; When reasonable demands for local self-government or minority
rights have been arbitrarily rejected by a central government, even
without large-scale violence. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   This exception, however, would come into play only when minimal
demands are rejected. It does not mean that the United States or
the United Nations should substitute their judgment of what is fair
or politically reasonable for that of the parties involved.
</P>
<P>
   According to the 1992 U.N. General Assembly declaration on
minority rights, states must ``protect the existence'' of
minorities, granting the latter the right ``to participate
effectively in cultural, religious, social, economic and public
life.'' However, it neither mandates the scope of that
participation nor grants minorities a veto over all actions that
might affect them.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and others should encourage the resolution of
claims to self-determination by means short of secession, except
when the parties agree to the division of a state. Statehood is not
necessary, however, to guarantee the legitimate rights of groups
and individuals to protect and promote their culture, language,
traditions and rights.
</P>
<P>
   The fulfillment of goals such as increased political and
economic power is more legitimately sought through the normal
democratic process. Potential mediators and advisers will need to
become familiar with a host of arrangements such as power-sharing,
devolution, federalism, confederation, territorial and functional
autonomy, self-government and special participation rights for
minorities or regional groups.
</P>
<P>
   To ensure equity, minorities in a new state that was founded to
preserve ethnic or cultural homogeneity should be granted the same
rights of self-determination that were asserted by the majority
population. Legitimate self-determination can only be exercised on
the basis of the consent of all involved parties, not just those
who wish to separate.
</P>
<P>
   If neither international law nor politics offers a mechanism
through which minorities trapped within a new ethnic state may
rejoin their former state or, at least, create an autonomous region
within their new home, rejection of the new borders by force may be
seen as the only alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Put simply, redressing historical grievances or responding to
contemporary dissatisfactions cannot justify the dispossession of
members of ethnic minorities who now live in the territory in
question and whose ancestors may have lived there for generations.
No group can claim exclusive control over a territory forever.
</P>
<P>
   It is morally impossible to decide which individuals should be
forced to choose between emigrating or remaining under ``alien''
domination and which other groups should be rewarded with
ethnically based political power in the form of a new state.
</P>
<P>
   If our concern is with peoples rather than territories, there is
no reason to regard existing administrative or ``republic''
boundaries within states as sacrosanct. In most cases, the best way
to determine the wishes of those in a new state would be through a
series of plebiscites to redraw what were formerly internal
boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   These should not be used in haste or to create enclaves that are
not viable. A peaceful acceptance of the possibility of altering
borders might be a useful precondition for recognition of a new
state whenever much of the population appears at odds with the new
borders.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, when armed conflict does occur, responsibility for war
crimes and crimes against humanity must be distinguished from the
underlying political agendas of all sides.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and others should continue to support
international accountability for such war criminals, even if the
problems of the prosecutions are only too evident from the halting
work of the ongoing U.N. tribunals on Rwanda and the former
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, prosecution of war criminals should not be linked
to the merits of self-determination claims. A principled response
to claims asserted before the onslaught of armed conflict cannot
depend on whether war crimes are committed after the conflict
begins.
</P>

power-hungry individuals from seeking independence, whether for

<P>
   It has been suggested that males, in our species and others, are
more prone to violence than females.
</P>
<P>
   And indeed, despite the current academic bias against genetic
explanations for behavior, this evidence does show that males are
indeed more likely to fight, murder, loot, pillage and, of course,
rape, than females.
</P>
<P>
   The question remains, however, whether this apparently innate
male predilection has much to do with war, international relations
and politics.
</P>
<P>
   In the anthropology of war, there is little basis for locating
the wellspring of war in aggressive male instincts _ or in any
instincts, for that matter. Wars are not barroom brawls writ large,
but, as social theorist Robin Fox puts it, ``complicated,
orchestrated, highly organized'' collective undertakings that
cannot be explained by any individual impulse.
</P>
<P>
   No plausible instinct would impel a man to leave his home, cut
his hair short and drill for hours under the hot sun. As
anthropologists Clifton B. Kroeber and Bernard L. Fontana have
pointed out, ``It is a large step from what may be biologically
innate leanings toward individual aggression to ritualized,
socially sanctioned, institutionalized group warfare.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, as a 1989 conference on the anthropology of war concluded,
``The hypothesis of a killer instinct is ... not so much irrelevant
as wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the male appetite for battle has always been far less
voracious than either biologically inclined theorists of war or
army commanders might like. In traditional societies, warriors
often had to be taunted, intoxicated or ritually ``transformed''
into animal form before battle.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Western history, individual men have gone to
near-suicidal lengths to avoid participating in wars _ cutting off
fingers or limbs or risking execution by deserting. Prior to the
advent of the nationalist armies of the 19th century, desertion
rates in European armies were so high that, according to historian
Geoffrey Parker, ``at certain times, almost an entire army would
vanish into thin air.''
</P>
<P>
   So unreliable and prone to escape was the rank and file of the
famed 18th-century Prussian army that military manuals forbade
allowing the men to camp near wooded areas. Even in the supposedly
highly motivated armies of 20th-century democracies, few men can
bring themselves to shoot directly at individual enemies _ a fact,
as Lt. Col. Dave Grossman writes in ``On Killing: The Psychological
Cost of Learning to Kill in War and Society,'' that has posed a
persistent challenge to the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, we need not resort to instinctual male
aggressiveness to explain the male near-monopoly on warfare through
time. One reason is clearly biological, resting on men's advantage
in upper body strength _ an undeniable plus when the weapons of war
are heavy swords, spears, pikes, maces or clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Another explanation is cultural, or at least as purely cultural
as one can be: In many, if not most, human societies, male
initiation rites feature acts of violence committed by or on the
initiates, and one of the most common of these rites has been
participation in battle.
</P>
<P>
   Through ``blooding a spear,'' a boy proved his manhood _ or
through ordering the bombing of some smaller nation, in the case of
recent American presidents. For an activity to be a male initiatory
rite, it cannot, of course, be open to women and girls. Hence the
widespread taboos on female handling of weapons and, in many cases,
even the tools of peaceable male-dominated crafts.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no reason to think that such initiatory activities
derive from instinctual male proclivities. In some cultural
settings, the young male's initiation to the adult world may be
entirely bloodless, featuring the receipt of a diploma or admission
into a guild.
</P>
<P>
   In others it may be violent in ways not related to war,
involving circumcision, homosexual rape or nose-bleeding induced
with sharp sticks _ activities that few would say are instinctually
driven.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the very purpose of male initiation rites is to
distinguish biological maleness _ which undoubtedly includes a
healthy desire for self-preservation _ from cultural manhood, which
requires a certain amount of self-discipline and even
self-sacrifice for the group (as does cultural womanhood).
</P>
<P>
   Nor can it be assumed that the male monopoly on warfare has been
eternal and universal.
</P>
<P>
   Gravesites recently excavated in Russia contain the remains of
women warriors from the second millennium B.C. _ female skeletons
buried with weapons and bearing wounds inflicted by similar
weapons. The victims of the famous Neolithic massacre at Jebel
Sahaba included both women and men, and there is no evidence that
the perpetrators were exclusively male.
</P>
<P>
   Moving back into the Paleolithic Age, when hunting was probably
the principal form of human violence, growing archaeological
evidence suggests that it was a communal enterprise in which women
and children joined men in driving herds over cliffs into nets or
culs-de-sac.
</P>
<P>
   The male-centered hunting strategy that figured so prominently
in the writings of sociobiologists in the 1960s and '70s _ in which
a small band of men stalks an individual animal _ may be a rather
recent innovation, necessitated by declining game populations in
the Mesolithic Age.
</P>
<P>
   In ancient civilizations, some of the earliest deities
worshipped by humans were female, but they were hardly the
nurturing earth mothers imagined by many scholars. The archaic
goddesses unearthed from Mesopotamian ruins or recalled in
Mesoamerican mythology were huntresses and avid consumers of blood
sacrifices, often accompanied or represented by predators such as
lions and leopards.
</P>
<P>
   Only later were these terrifying deities ``tamed'' through
marriage to patriarchical male gods and reassigned to agricultural
duties. Although the characteristics of the archaic goddesses tell
us nothing about the roles of actual women, they do suggest a time
when the association of manhood with violence and of femininity
with peace was not as self-evident as it has seemed in the modern
age.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, whatever our genetic and prehistoric cultural
legacies, women in the past two centuries have more than adequately
demonstrated a capacity for collective violence. They have played a
leading role in nonmilitary violence such as 18th- and 19th-century
bread riots and revolutionary uprisings, in which they were often
reputed to be ``foremost in violence and ferocity.''
</P>
<P>
   In World War II, the Soviet military deployed them as fighter
pilots and in ground combat. Since then, women have served as
terrorists and guerilla fighters in wars of national liberation.
More to the point, women have proved themselves no less susceptible
than men to the passions of militaristic nationalism: Witness
feminist leader Sylvia Pankhurst, who set aside the struggle for
suffrage to mobilize English support for World War I by, for
example, publicly shaming men into enlisting.
</P>
<P>
   Among heads of government, Margaret Thatcher is certainly an
exception to the gender dichotomy. And of course the greatest
pacifist leaders of the 20th century were male: Martin Luther King
Jr. and Mohandas K. Gandhi.
</P>
<P>
   Inherent aggressiveness of men and niceness of women? Perhaps
one thing is true: Whatever the innate psychological differences
between the sexes, a certain male propensity for chest-thumping
persists _ and it can be found among desk-dwelling American
scholars as well as alpha apes.

feminist leader Sylvia Pankhurst, who set aside the struggle for
suffrage to mobilize English support for World War I by, for
example, publicly shaming men into enlisting.
</P>
<P>
   Among heads of government, Margaret Thatcher is certainly an
exception to the gender dichotomy. And of course the greatest
pacifist leaders of the 20th century were male: Martin Luther King
Jr. and Mohandas K. Gandhi.
</P>
<P>
   Inherent aggressiveness of men and niceness of women? Perhaps
one thing is true: Whatever the innate psychological differences
between the sexes, a certain male propensity for chest-thumping
persists _ and it can be found among desk-dwelling American
scholars as well as alpha apes.

<P>
   Virtually all feminists who study international politics seek
the laudable goal of greater female participation in all aspects of
foreign relations, from executive mansions and foreign ministries
to militaries and universities.
</P>
<P>
   They disagree as to whether women should get ahead in politics
by demonstrating traditional masculine virtues of toughness,
aggression, competitiveness and the willingness to use force when
necessary _ or whether they should move the agenda of politics away
from male preoccupations with hierarchy and domination.
</P>
<P>
   This ambivalence was demonstrated in the feminist reaction to
Margaret Thatcher, who by any account was far tougher and more
determined than any of the male politicians she came up against.
Thatcher's conservative politics did not endear her to most
feminists, who much prefer a Mary Robinson or Gro Harlem Brundtland
as their model of a female leader, despite _ or because of _ the
fact that Thatcher had beaten men at their own game.
</P>
<P>
   Given the recent findings and research in genetics and new
biology, it would seem that there is something to the contention of
many feminists that phenomena such as aggression, violence, war and
intense competition for dominance in a status hierarchy are more
closely associated with men than women.
</P>
<P>
   Theories of international relations that see global politics as
a remorseless struggle for power are in fact what feminists call a
gendered perspective, describing the behavior of states controlled
by men. Feminists claim that a world run by women would follow
different rules, and it is toward that sort of world that all
postindustrial or Western societies are moving.As women gain power
in these countries, the argument goes, the latter should become
less aggressive, adventurous, competitive and violent.
</P>
<P>
   But the problem with the feminist view is that it sees attitudes
toward violence, power and status as wholly the products of a
patriarchal culture, whereas in fact it appears they are rooted in
biology. This makes these attitudes harder to change in men and
consequently in societies.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the rise of women, men will continue to play a major, if
not dominant, part in the governance of postindustrial countries,
not to mention less-developed ones. The realms of war and
international politics in particular will remain controlled by men
for longer than many feminists would like.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, the task of resocializing men to be more like
women _ that is, less violent _ will run into strict limits. What
is bred in the bone cannot be altered easily by changes in culture
and ideology.
</P>
<P>
   While some gender roles are indeed socially constructed,
virtually all reputable evolutionary biologists today think there
are profound differences between the sexes that are genetically
rather than culturally rooted, and that these differences extend
beyond the body into the realm of the mind. In no area is
sex-related difference clearer than with respect to violence and
aggression.
</P>
<P>
   The core of the feminist agenda for international politics seems
fundamentally correct: The violent and aggressive tendencies of men
have to be controlled, not simply by redirecting them to external
aggression but by constraining those impulses through a web of
norms, laws, agreements, contracts and the like.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, more women need to be brought into the domain of
international politics as leaders, officials, soldiers and voters.
Only by participating fully in global politics can women both
defend their own interests and shift the underlying male agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The feminization of world politics has, of course, been taking
place gradually over the past hundred years, with very positive
effects. Women have won the right to vote and participate in
politics in all developed countries, as well as in many developing
countries, and have exercised that right with increasing energy.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States and other rich countries, a pronounced
gender gap with regard to foreign policy and national security
issues endures. American women have always been less supportive
than American men of U.S. involvement in war, including World War
II, Korea, Vietnam and the Persian Gulf War, by an average margin
of 7 percent to 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   They are also consistently less supportive of defense spending
and the use of force abroad. In a 1995 Roper survey conducted for
the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations, men favored U.S.
intervention in Korea, in the event of a North Korean attack, by a
margin of 49 percent to 40 percent, while women were opposed by a
margin of 30 percent to 54 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, U.S. military action against Iraq, in the event it
invaded Saudi Arabia, was supported by men by a margin of 62
percent to 31 percent and opposed by women by 43 percent to 45
percent. While 54 percent of men felt it important to maintain
superior worldwide military power, only 45 percent of women agreed.
Women, moreover, are less likely than men to see force as a
legitimate tool for resolving conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to know how to account for this gender gap.
Observers have suggested various reasons why women are less willing
to use military force than men, including their role as mothers,
the fact that many women are feminists (that is, committed to a
left-of-center agenda that is generally hostile to U.S.
intervention), and partisan affiliation (more women vote Democratic
than men).
</P>
<P>
   It is unnecessary to know the reason for the correlation between
gender and antimilitarism, however, to predict that increasing
female political participation will probably make the United States
and other democracies less inclined to use power around the world
as freely as they have in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Will this shift toward a less status- and
military-power-oriented world be a good thing? For relations
between states in the so-called democratic zone of peace, the
answer is yes. Consideration of gender adds a great deal to the
past decade's vigorous and interesting debate over the correlation
between democracy and peace.
</P>
<P>
   The ``democratic peace'' argument, which underlies the foreign
policy of the Clinton administration as well as its predecessors,
is that democracies tend not to fight one another. The reasons
usually cited by democratic peace theorists for why democracies are
pacific toward one another _ the rule of law, respect for
individual rights, the commercial nature of most democracies and
the like _ are undoubtedly correct.
</P>
<P>
   But there is another factor that has generally not been taken
into account. Developed democracies also tend to be more feminized
than authoritarian states, in terms of the expansion of female
franchise and female participation in political decision-making.
</P>
<P>
   It should therefore surprise no one that the historically
unprecedented shift in the sexual basis of politics should lead to
a change in international relations. On the other hand, if gender
roles are not simply socially constructed but rooted in genetics,
there will be limits on the extent to which international politics
can change.
</P>
<P>
   Some feminists talk as if gender identities can be discarded
like an old sweater, perhaps by putting young men through mandatory
gender-studies courses when they are college freshmen. Indeed, male
attitudes on a host of issues, from child-rearing and housework to
``getting in touch with your feelings,'' have changed dramatically
in the past couple of generations because of social pressure.
</P>
<P>
   But socialization can accomplish only so much, and efforts to
fully feminize young men will probably be no more successful than
the Soviet Union's efforts were to persuade its people to work on
Saturdays on behalf of the heroic Cuban and Vietnamese people.
</P>
<P>
   Male tendencies to band together for competitive purposes, to
seek to dominate status hierarchies and to act out aggressive
fantasies toward one another can be rechanneled _ but never
eliminated. What's more, in anything but a totally feminized world,
feminized policies could be a liability.
</P>
<P>
   Even if we can assume peaceful relations between democracies,
the broader world scene will still be populated by states led by
the occasional Slobodan Milosevic or Saddam Hussein. Even if the
democratic, feminized, postindustrial world has evolved into a zone
of peace where struggles are more economic than military, it will
still have to deal with those parts of the world run by
power-wielding, ambitious, unconstrained men.

<P>
   The United States, as Zbigniew Brzezinski once said, will be the
first, last and only global superpower.
</P>
<P>
   American officials quite naturally tend to act as if the world
were unipolar. They boast of American power and American virtue,
hailing the United States as a benevolent hegemon. They lecture
other countries on the universal validity of American principles,
practices and institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright calls the United States
``the indispensable nation'' and said that ``we stand tall and
hence see further than other nations.''
</P>
<P>
   This statement is true in the narrow sense that the United
States is an indispensable participant in any effort to tackle
major global problems. It is false in implying that other nations
are dispensable, and that American indispensability is the source
of wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   Before the end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet
Union, the United States was often able to impose its will on other
countries. That unipolar moment has passed. Today the two principal
tools of coercion that the United States attempts to use are
economic sanctions and military intervention.
</P>
<P>
   Sanctions work, however, only when other countries also support
them, and that is decreasingly the case. Hence, the United States
either applies them unilaterally to the detriment of its economic
interests and its relations with allies, or it does not enforce
them, in which case they become symbols of American weakness.
</P>
<P>
   At relatively low cost, the United States can launch bombing or
cruise-missile attacks against its enemies. Yet by themselves, such
actions achieve little. More serious military interventions have to
meet three conditions. They must be legitimated through some
international organization, such as the United Nations, where they
are subject to Russian, Chinese or French veto. They also require
the participation of allied forces, which may or may not be
forthcoming. And they have to involve no American casualties and
virtually no ``collateral'' casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the United States meets all three conditions, it risks
stirring up not only criticism at home but widespread political and
popular backlash abroad.
</P>
<P>
   American officials seem peculiarly blind to the fact that often
the more the United States attacks a foreign leader, the more his
popularity soars among countrymen who applaud him for standing tall
against the greatest power on earth.
</P>
<P>
   The demonizing of leaders has so far failed to shorten their
tenure in power, from Fidel Castro (who has survived eight American
presidents) to Slobodan Milosevic and Saddam Hussein. Indeed, the
best way for a dictator of a small country to prolong his tenure in
power may be to provoke the United States into denouncing him as
the leader of a ``rogue regime'' and a threat to global peace.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that neither the Clinton administration nor Congress
nor the public is willing to pay the costs and accept the risks of
unilateral global leadership. Some advocates of American leadership
argue for increasing defense expenditures by 50 percent, but that
is a nonstarter. The American public clearly sees no need to expend
effort and resources to achieve American hegemony.
</P>
<P>
   However much foreign-policy elites may ignore or deplore it, the
United States lacks the domestic political base to create a
unipolar world. By acting as if this were a unipolar world, the
United States becomes increasingly alone among nations. American
leaders constantly claim to be speaking on behalf of ``the
international community.'' But whom do they have in mind? China?
Russia? India? Pakistan? Iran? The Arab world? The Association of
Southeast Asian Nations? Africa? Latin America? France? Do any of
these countries or regions see the United States as the spokesman
for a community of which they are a part?
</P>
<P>
   The community for which the United States speaks includes, at
best, its Anglo-Saxon cousins (Britain, Canada, Australia, New
Zealand) on most issues, Germany and some smaller European
democracies on many issues, Israel on some Middle Eastern questions
and Japan on the implementation of U.N. resolutions. These are
important states, but they fall far short of being the global
international community.
</P>
<P>
   On issue after issue, the United States has found itself
increasingly alone, with one or a few partners, opposing most of
the rest of the world's states and peoples. These issues include
U.N. dues; the land mines treaty; global warming; an international
war crimes tribunal; the Middle East; the use of force against Iraq
and Yugoslavia; and sanctions against Cuba, Iran, Iraq and Libya.
</P>
<P>
   On these and other issues, much of the international community
is on one side and the United States is on the other. The circle of
governments who see their interests coinciding with American
interests is shrinking. While the United States regularly denounces
various countries as ``rogue states,'' in the eyes of many
countries it is becoming the rogue superpower.
</P>
<P>
   At a 1997 Harvard conference, scholars reported that the elites
of countries comprising at least two-thirds of the world's people _
Chinese, Russians, Indians, Arabs, Muslims and Africans _ see the
United States as the single greatest external threat to their
societies.
</P>
<P>
   They do not regard America as a military threat but as a menace
to their integrity, autonomy, prosperity and freedom of action.
They view the United States as intrusive, interventionist,
exploitative, unilateralist, hegemonic, hypocritical and applying
double standards, engaging in what they label ``financial
imperialism'' and ``intellectual colonialism,'' with a foreign
policy driven overwhelmingly by domestic politics.
</P>
<P>
   Such reactions are to be expected. American leaders believe that
the world's business is their business. However, other countries
believe that what happens in their part of the world is their
business, not America's, and quite explicitly respond.
</P>
<P>
   In a bipolar world, many countries welcomed the United States as
their protector against the Soviet Union. In today's world, in
contrast, the world's only superpower is automatically a threat to
other major powers.
</P>
<P>
   It would behoove Americans to stop acting and talking as if this
were a unipolar world. It is not. To deal with any major global
issue, the United States needs the cooperation of at least some
major powers. Unilateral sanctions and interventions are recipes
for foreign-policy disasters.
</P>
<P>
   American leaders also should abandon the benign-hegemon illusion
that a natural congruity exists between their interests and their
values and those of the rest of the world. It does not. At times,

<P>
   The United States, as Zbigniew Brzezinski once said, will be the
first, last and only global superpower.
</P>
<P>
   American officials quite naturally tend to act as if the world
were unipolar. They boast of American power and American virtue,
hailing the United States as a benevolent hegemon. They lecture
other countries on the universal validity of American principles,
practices and institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright calls the United States
``the indispensable nation'' and said that ``we stand tall and
hence see further than other nations.''
</P>
<P>
   This statement is true in the narrow sense that the United
States is an indispensable participant in any effort to tackle
major global problems. It is false in implying that other nations
are dispensable, and that American indispensability is the source
of wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   Before the end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet
Union, the United States was often able to impose its will on other
countries. That unipolar moment has passed. Today the two principal
tools of coercion that the United States attempts to use are
economic sanctions and military intervention.
</P>
<P>
   Sanctions work, however, only when other countries also support
them, and that is decreasingly the case. Hence, the United States
either applies them unilaterally to the detriment of its economic
interests and its relations with allies, or it does not enforce
them, in which case they become symbols of American weakness.
</P>
<P>
   At relatively low cost, the United States can launch bombing or
cruise-missile attacks against its enemies. Yet by themselves, such
actions achieve little. More serious military interventions have to
meet three conditions. They must be legitimated through some
international organization, such as the United Nations, where they
are subject to Russian, Chinese or French veto. They also require
the participation of allied forces, which may or may not be
forthcoming. And they have to involve no American casualties and
virtually no ``collateral'' casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the United States meets all three conditions, it risks
stirring up not only criticism at home but widespread political and
popular backlash abroad.
</P>
<P>
   American officials seem peculiarly blind to the fact that often
the more the United States attacks a foreign leader, the more his
popularity soars among countrymen who applaud him for standing tall
against the greatest power on earth.
</P>
<P>
   The demonizing of leaders has so far failed to shorten their
tenure in power, from Fidel Castro (who has survived eight American
presidents) to Slobodan Milosevic and Saddam Hussein. Indeed, the
best way for a dictator of a small country to prolong his tenure in
power may be to provoke the United States into denouncing him as
the leader of a ``rogue regime'' and a threat to global peace.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that neither the Clinton administration nor Congress
nor the public is willing to pay the costs and accept the risks of
unilateral global leadership. Some advocates of American leadership
argue for increasing defense expenditures by 50 percent, but that
is a nonstarter. The American public clearly sees no need to expend
effort and resources to achieve American hegemony.
</P>
<P>
   However much foreign-policy elites may ignore or deplore it, the
United States lacks the domestic political base to create a
unipolar world. By acting as if this were a unipolar world, the
United States becomes increasingly alone among nations. American
leaders constantly claim to be speaking on behalf of ``the
international community.'' But whom do they have in mind? China?
Russia? India? Pakistan? Iran? The Arab world? The Association of
Southeast Asian Nations? Africa? Latin America? France? Do any of
these countries or regions see the United States as the spokesman
for a community of which they are a part?
</P>
<P>
   The community for which the United States speaks includes, at
best, its Anglo-Saxon cousins (Britain, Canada, Australia, New
Zealand) on most issues, Germany and some smaller European
democracies on many issues, Israel on some Middle Eastern questions
and Japan on the implementation of U.N. resolutions. These are
important states, but they fall far short of being the global
international community.
</P>
<P>
   On issue after issue, the United States has found itself
increasingly alone, with one or a few partners, opposing most of
the rest of the world's states and peoples. These issues include
U.N. dues; the land mines treaty; global warming; an international
war crimes tribunal; the Middle East; the use of force against Iraq
and Yugoslavia; and sanctions against Cuba, Iran, Iraq and Libya.
</P>
<P>
   On these and other issues, much of the international community
is on one side and the United States is on the other. The circle of
governments who see their interests coinciding with American
interests is shrinking. While the United States regularly denounces
various countries as ``rogue states,'' in the eyes of many
countries it is becoming the rogue superpower.
</P>
<P>
   At a 1997 Harvard conference, scholars reported that the elites
of countries comprising at least two-thirds of the world's people _
Chinese, Russians, Indians, Arabs, Muslims and Africans _ see the
United States as the single greatest external threat to their
societies.
</P>
<P>
   They do not regard America as a military threat but as a menace
to their integrity, autonomy, prosperity and freedom of action.
They view the United States as intrusive, interventionist,
exploitative, unilateralist, hegemonic, hypocritical and applying
double standards, engaging in what they label ``financial
imperialism'' and ``intellectual colonialism,'' with a foreign
policy driven overwhelmingly by domestic politics.
</P>
<P>
   Such reactions are to be expected. American leaders believe that
the world's business is their business. However, other countries
believe that what happens in their part of the world is their
business, not America's, and quite explicitly respond.
</P>
<P>
   In a bipolar world, many countries welcomed the United States as
their protector against the Soviet Union. In today's world, in
contrast, the world's only superpower is automatically a threat to
other major powers.
</P>
<P>
   It would behoove Americans to stop acting and talking as if this
were a unipolar world. It is not. To deal with any major global
issue, the United States needs the cooperation of at least some
major powers. Unilateral sanctions and interventions are recipes
for foreign-policy disasters.
</P>
<P>
   American leaders also should abandon the benign-hegemon illusion
that a natural congruity exists between their interests and their
values and those of the rest of the world. It does not. At times,
American actions may promote public goods and serve more widely
accepted ends. But often they will not, in part because of the
unique moralistic component in American policy.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also simply because America is the only superpower,
and hence its interests necessarily differ from those of other
countries. This makes America unique _ but certainly not benign in
the eyes of those countries.

<P>
   ``Foreign policy leadership'' has become an ambiguous phrase. It
once meant leading the American people in the formation and
execution of national policy.
</P>
<P>
   But some now use it to state a less obvious idea: the United
States leading other nations in the international arena. Why should
other nations follow U.S. leaders rather than their own?
</P>
<P>
   Leadership involves some common stake between the leader and the
led, some basis for agreement on goals to be sought and prices to
be paid. The more recent meaning of foreign-policy leadership has
thrust itself to the fore because of America's claim to be ``the
leader of the free world.''
</P>
<P>
   That claim arose during World War II, when the United States was
the de facto leader of the Allies. It made sense to have a dominant
partner in the military alliance for the duration of the war
effort. Even after 1945 there have been military alliances, such as
NATO and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, in which the
United States could properly be called the leader.
</P>
<P>
   But the term ''leader of the free world'' came to have a more
grandiose meaning, extending to nations with no formal alliance
with the United States. In the global struggle between two
ideologies, only the capitalist nations could be described as free.
We aspired not only to lead them all but to entice socialist
countries to join us as well.
</P>
<P>
   There has never been a more universal agenda. America was the
champion of freedom anywhere freedom was valued or challenged or
losing _ covering all situations for all peoples. The United States
considered itself not only a legitimate leader but actually more
legitimate than indigenous leaders who did not meet the U.S.
definition of freedom-loving behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Washington ``led'' people by removing inauthentic leaders _ the
enemies of freedom _ even when the people had chosen them. Over
time, American leadership substituted for that of Muhammad Mossadeq
in Iran, Patrice Lumumba in the Congo, Ngo Dinh Diem in South
Vietnam, Rafael Trujillo in the Dominican Republic, Manuel Noriega
in Panama and many others.
</P>
<P>
   This is what was considered leading the free world. But however
justified these acts may have been strategically, they cannot be
called leadership. Leaders persuade followers. The United States
used covert action, sabotage and threats. What is the proper
description of what the United States was doing?
</P>
<P>
   ``Imperialism'' does not seem the right word, since an empire
usually absorbs subject states and takes their natural resources,
markets or labor. The United States, in contrast, wanted a network
of perches for military action against the Soviet Union. It did not
want to annex the countries but to use them _ call it ``security
imperialism.''
</P>
<P>
   This approach began with the Strategic Air Command, whose bases
had to be guaranteed if the U.S. military was to be able to deliver
nuclear weapons. Naturally, any facility servicing U.S. planes or
warships had to be protected by the United States, even if it was
on foreign soil.
</P>
<P>
   And America clearly needed friendly regimes at those sites. From
this it was a short step to removing unfriendly officials or
promoting subservient ones. All this was done in the name of
freedom, and it did not look sufficiently like old-fashioned
imperialism (at least to us) for Americans to question it. Instead,
it was called leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Thus ``leader of the free world'' came to infect American
language and thinking. Even with the end of the Cold War, many have
not jettisoned the idea, although it is heard less often.
</P>
<P>
   As the world's only superpower, America is told that it must act
like ``a great nation,'' which still means defending freedom around
the world. That is a difficult enough task for any nation. It is
even more difficult for America, not only because of its
established Cold War pattern but also because of its longstanding
tradition of holding aloof from international partnerships.
</P>
<P>
   The view that the United States acts authentically only when it
acts independently has recurred, from Thomas Jefferson's warning
against ''entangling alliances'' through the Monroe Doctrine,
manifest destiny and rejection of the League of Nations to the
current distrust of the United Nations, the International Monetary
Fund (IMF), the International Criminal Court and any agencies set
up to monitor seas, pollution or land mines.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever else this suspicious attitude does, it cripples
America's ability to lead other countries. A leader must understand
followers and be able to enlist their energies so that they are
willing to do something for the greater good. Force, subversion and
defiance are not the traits of a leader. No one can lead people
without listening to them, reasoning with them, and showing respect
for them.
</P>
<P>
   The wisest diplomatic advice in America's founding period is
also its most neglected. It was enunciated by James Madison in The
Federalist, No. 63:
</P>
<P>
   ``An attention to the judgment of other nations is important to
every government for two reasons. The one is that, independently of
the merits of any particular plan or measure, it is desirable, on
various accounts, that it should appear to other nations as the
offspring of a wise and honorable policy.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the concerns of others should be taken into
account regardless of the particular policy at issue. If support
cannot be elicited, at least there should be no needless hostility
aroused or misunderstandings fostered.
</P>
<P>
   But Madison, not content to say just that, continues:
</P>
<P>
   ``The second is that, in doubtful cases, particularly where the
national councils may be warped by some strong passion or momentary
interest, the presumed or known opinion of the impartial world may
be the best guide that can be followed.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, if we listen, we may learn something, discover our own
error or, at the least, learn what objections it would be wise to
consider. Now that is leadership talk.
</P>
<P>
   Madison was talking about the need to have a senate of older
members with longer tenure who could ponder foreign relations with
some knowledge of other countries in order to deal with them
intelligently _ an institution lacking in the unicameral Congress
of the Articles of Confederation.
</P>
<P>
   States under the Articles ignored or defied international
agreements on foreign debts, Indian relations and navigation,
actions that should sound familiar at a time when the United States
is refusing to pay its share of the U.N. budget.
</P>
<P>
   But how many politicians today would say that the United States
should go to international forums to learn rather than to dictate?
World opinion, Americans are constantly told, should be defied when
it does not match the U.S. view of reality. (Of course, one reality
this view most needs to acknowledge is that there is a world
outside the United States.)
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, for example, the fact that world opinion advised
America to leave Vietnam became an argument for staying there: Are
we to be led by others' views? We must go our own way.
</P>
<P>
   What can explain this unwillingness to accept partnership, a
prior condition of leadership? Travelers often notice the contrast
between foreign papers' coverage of international affairs and
America's exiguous reporting on things beyond its borders. Even the
best newspapers have skimpy reports of any but a few international
events.
</P>
<P>
   This stems partly from the fact that the United States has so
few immediate neighbors. The nations of Europe jostle along in
close proximity to a dozen other countries and languages, while
Americans refuse to school themselves in any foreign tongue, even
in the Spanish of their nearest neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor behind this ignorance of other nations may be
America's lack of an overt empire. European habits of reporting
began when uncles and grandfathers remembered serving in India or
the Congo or Indochina.
</P>
<P>
   American elections are decided mainly on domestic issues, except
in times of war. Even then, public interest in the world is so
minimal that the relevant geography is fuzzy. How long did it take
for Americans to discover where Laos was, or Cambodia? Who can tell
exactly where Kosovo is? How many citizens have atlases that
reflect the extensive changes in national boundaries over the last
decade?
</P>
<P>
   It is not surprising that foreign affairs become matters of
electoral concern only when they project domestic disputes.
</P>
<P>
   When the people lack interest in foreign affairs, foreign-policy
elites tend to conclude that the subject is beyond the capacity of
all but a few. Not only does the U.S. government dismiss world
opinion, it dismisses the opinion of its own voters. Yet leading
the American people is the necessary prelude to addressing others
in the world. And a necessary condition to leading Americans is
consulting them, recruiting their support and persuading them when
they doubt or hesitate.
</P>
<P>
   If, as President Clinton says, the United States should be at
the nexus of trade exchanges, it must also place itself at the
points of political intersection. National security will depend on
the ties that bind people together.
</P>
<P>
   But America cannot bring other nations into any kind of dialogue
until its internal discourse is active and informed. Until
America's leaders address the American people and other nations
with that kind of respect, attention and persuasion, we shall lack
foreign policy leadership of any sort.

</P>
<P>
   What can explain this unwillingness to accept partnership, a
prior condition of leadership? Travelers often notice the contrast
between foreign papers' coverage of international affairs and
America's exiguous reporting on things beyond its borders. Even the
best newspapers have skimpy reports of any but a few international
events.
</P>
<P>
   This stems partly from the fact that the United States has so
few immediate neighbors. The nations of Europe jostle along in
close proximity to a dozen other countries and languages, while
Americans refuse to school themselves in any foreign tongue, even
in the Spanish of their nearest neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor behind this ignorance of other nations may be
America's lack of an overt empire. European habits of reporting
began when uncles and grandfathers remembered serving in India or
the Congo or Indochina.
</P>
<P>
   American elections are decided mainly on domestic issues, except
in times of war. Even then, public interest in the world is so
minimal that the relevant geography is fuzzy. How long did it take
for Americans to discover where Laos was, or Cambodia? Who can tell
exactly where Kosovo is? How many citizens have atlases that
reflect the extensive changes in national boundaries over the last
decade?
</P>
<P>
   It is not surprising that foreign affairs become matters of
electoral concern only when they project domestic disputes.
</P>
<P>
   When the people lack interest in foreign affairs, foreign-policy
elites tend to conclude that the subject is beyond the capacity of
all but a few. Not only does the U.S. government dismiss world
opinion, it dismisses the opinion of its own voters. Yet leading
the American people is the necessary prelude to addressing others
in the world. And a necessary condition to leading Americans is
consulting them, recruiting their support and persuading them when
they doubt or hesitate.
</P>
<P>
   If, as President Clinton says, the United States should be at
the nexus of trade exchanges, it must also place itself at the
points of political intersection. National security will depend on
the ties that bind people together.
</P>
<P>
   But America cannot bring other nations into any kind of dialogue
until its internal discourse is active and informed. Until
America's leaders address the American people and other nations
with that kind of respect, attention and persuasion, we shall lack
foreign policy leadership of any sort.

   Television's foreign correspondents do not travel light.
</P>
<P>
   Off camera, their distinguishing feature is the small mountain
of equipment traveling with them, which sets baggage handlers to
dreaming of large tips and airlines to calculating budget-busting
excess-weight charges.
</P>
<P>
   The financial burden of that luggage is only one factor making
the network-TV foreign correspondent an endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   New technologies in cable and satellite TV have turned the
stable, predictable, almost automatically profitable television
marketplace into a competitive cauldron in which journalism must
increasingly compete with entertainment programming. This has
prompted a redefining, or at least a questioning, of the
traditional news agenda in the post-Cold War world.
</P>
<P>
   Producers and network executives believe the American mass
audience's interest in daily events beyond their nation's borders
is declining, so little such news is offered. And yet the image of
the correspondent reporting from some troubled land has become
firmly imprinted in viewers' imaginations.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, a television foreign correspondent performed
three functions. First, he _ it was a mostly male club _ was a
journalist reporting the story.
</P>
<P>
   He was also the report's producer, deciding what events or
visual elements needed to be filmed and what interviews recorded to
make the story. In the half-hour news format, reports initially ran
a minimum of two-and-a-half minutes and often three to five
minutes, compared with one-and-a-half minutes or even less today.
</P>
<P>
   Reports required a narrative line with the reporter as
storyteller, which brought up the correspondent's third role, more
image-driven than the first two but equally essential: He was a
familiar figure who established the news program's ``presence'' in
the story.
</P>
<P>
   Merely by being there, the correspondent gave the network
credibility, demonstrating to viewers that his organization spared
no effort or expense to be on the scene anywhere in the world where
important events were taking place.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately, however, it became apparent that the
correspondent had a partner with a will of its own: the camera. If
television's greatest strength was the transmission of human
experience rather than facts, analysis or concepts, the
correspondent ran the risk of becoming little more than a caption
writer for the moving pictures.
</P>
<P>
   With TV covering the earth, the question facing the foreign
correspondent was whether television news, besides offering drama
and emotion, could add, if not to viewers' detailed knowledge of
the world, at least to their awareness of it. The answer, I
believe, is that it has, although the effect is difficult to
quantify.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Vietnam War, television had an impact on public
opinion, which in turn affected the government's formulation of
foreign policy. Moreover, there are few signs that most Americans
seek a return to the ``splendid isolation'' of the pre-television
era. Many factors have contributed to that relative openness to the
world, but television has played a central role.
</P>
<P>
   The growth of network-TV news coincided with a broadening of the
foreign news agenda. Until the 1960s, correspondents (print and
electronic) were based primarily in the European capitals and
Tokyo. Those covering Latin America, Africa, the Middle East and
the rest of Asia were allotted few column inches and little
airtime, regardless of what was going on in those regions.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, however, that changed rapidly, not only because of
the longer network newscasts but also because of the growing
prominence of the Third World and the nonaligned nations movement,
both seen in the context of the Cold War rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   Travel became a key part of the foreign correspondent's job
description. The advent of the Boeing 707 halved the time it took
journalists to get to another continent. In the 1970s the routine
use of communications satellites made same-day coverage possible,
increasing the incentive for reporters and camera crews to race off
to breaking stories in remote locations.
</P>
<P>
   Newscasts saw a marked shift from overseas feature and
background stories to hard news. They gained the immediacy of
broadcasting ``today's news today,'' at the cost of the more
explanatory coverage that had been part of the evening news of
earlier years.
</P>
<P>
   For the foreign correspondent, instant satellite communications
left little time for developing expertise in a specific country.
Reporters became known as ``firemen,'' flying from one
international conflagration to the next.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1978 I was based in London, working for NBC News. On a
Monday morning of a quiet news period, I had no plans to leave the
city. By Saturday, I had covered South Moluccans seizing hostages
in the Netherlands, the Israeli incursion to the Litani River in
southern Lebanon, and the kidnapping of Prime Minister Aldo Moro in
Rome, and had returned home _ three stories in three countries on
two continents in five days.
</P>
<P>
   The passing of the Cold War era has left many institutions
adrift, searching for a new order or definition, and television
news is no exception. Broad viewer interest in world affairs is
declining from its modest Cold War heights just as U.S. global
influence is reaching new levels. This is the result of several
administrations' efforts to expand trade, businesses' need to
expand overseas, and the global dominance of American popular
culture, all driven by American leadership in the development and
exploitation of new technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Today more Americans than ever before are working and traveling
abroad, from CEOs to sales reps, students and tourists.
International trade is equal to about one-quarter of the U.S. gross
domestic product.
</P>
<P>
   Satellites transmit daily television programs from Europe, the
Middle East, Asia and Latin America. One can choose from on-line
computer services or download volumes of free information and
commentary from sites on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   More than the other news media, television is caught between the
declining interest in international affairs and rising costs and
competition. It is the most expensive medium for news, and
production costs for international reporting are particularly high.
</P>
<P>
   A correspondent for a newspaper, magazine, press agency or radio
station or network is engaged in what is basically one-person
journalism. He or she can travel to the scene of a story alone,
cover it alone, write it up alone, and transmit it alone via
telephone, fax or E-mail.
</P>
<P>
   But TV is of a different magnitude. The basic working unit in
international news consists of a correspondent, a field producer, a
cameraperson and a sound engineer, plus some 600 pounds of camera
and personal equipment. If a report is to be prepared for satellite
transmission, an editor and an additional 600 pounds of editing
equipment come along. (Because American television's technical
standards are incompatible with the systems the rest of the world
uses, the networks must bring all their own equipment.)
</P>
<P>
   The cost of this journalistic caravan, including hotels, per
diem expenses, car rentals and local support staff, begins at
around $3,000 a day. Airfare and excess-baggage charges can easily
reach $12,000. Then there are ``extras'' such as satellite fees.
New digital technology, including smaller and lighter cameras and
editing equipment, will eventually reduce costs, but there is no
indication that the networks would use the savings to increase
international coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The new litmus test at network news programs is whether viewers
(in the producers' opinion) will instinctively ``relate'' to the
story. As in other industries, as choice increases, power shifts
from the producer to the consumer.
</P>
<P>
   It is at this juncture that the new competitive pressures
collide with the journalistic ethos of the foreign correspondent as
well as the expectations of viewers interested in international
affairs. The network news programs and, indeed, news programs in
general ought to consider not only whether their response to market
forces can sustain good journalism but whether it is a sound
long-term business decision.
</P>
<P>
   The programs' producers can claim to be focusing on their
customers, or at least the largest portion of them. But the
editorial downsizing, narrowing of focus and increasing homogeneity
of content give viewers searching for broader exposure to the world
even less reason to watch the programs. It is a slippery slope.

<P>
   We pampered Westerners are all very martial as long as we are
only dropping ordnance from the sky.
</P>
<P>
   The air is thick with the stink of attitudinizing. Every
columnist, reporter, letter-writer, pub bore and backbencher knows
what should have been done, and what ought to be done now.
</P>
<P>
   You can sense the determination to be on the right side of
history when you hear them utter sentences beginning with words
like ``it was quite obvious from the beginning that...''
</P>
<P>
   Monday morning, disgracefully, I went back over past pieces that
I have written about Kosovo, hoping that they would show what a
prescient and clever fellow I am, and that they would defend me
from the various charges that those opposed to intervention now
level at those who support it.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes I disgust myself.
</P>
<P>
   What I believe about Kosovo _ that we had little alternative but
to intervene, and that we should now begin to deploy an army
charged with winning it back for its dispossessed people _ is not
the consequence of deep strategic and military insight. It is,
rather, a product of conscience allied to a deep worry about what
would happen elsewhere were we to fail this test.
</P>
<P>
   People on either side of this argument, who proclaim a clear and
almost infallible understanding of cause and effect in the Balkans,
are seeking to mobilize opinion rather than telling the truth.
</P>
<P>
   The desire to be vindicated by events is particularly strong in
those currently in opposition in Britain and America.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of last week, I heard an interview with the Tory
Party chairman Michael Ancram in which he more or less said that
his support for NATO action was dependent upon its eventual
outcome.
</P>
<P>
   In the U.S., the Republican front-runner for the 2000
presidential elections, George W Bush, answered the question about
action with one of his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``My question is: is it good for America?'' said the man from
Texas. ``Right now, as governor, I'm going to figure out how to get
a tax-cut through.''
</P>
<P>
   So if it turns out to be a success, then they are in favor of
it. If it is a catastrophe, then the weedy, liberal focus-groupies
in power in Washington and London will face the justified wrath of
the people.
</P>
<P>
   So far there has been surprisingly little wrath. In Germany,
opinion polls show more than 60 percent in favor of the air
strikes, while in France, there is 58 percent support, including
for the possible use of NATO ground troops. Here in Britain, there
is a big majority in favor of bombing, and a smaller one that
agrees to the use of the army.
</P>
<P>
   Slobodan Milosevic and his colleagues in Belgrade, however, may
well believe that such support is soft. We pampered Westerners are
all very martial as long as we're not taking any casualties and are
dropping ordnance from the sky (he may well tell his generals), but
like Corporal Jones's fuzzy-wuzzies, we don't like it up us, you
know.
</P>
<P>
   And Slobodan Milosevic has to look no further than the gung-ho
British newspaper, The Sun, for some proof. Slapped all over
Monday's page one was the banner headline: ``Don't send our troops
off to die.''
</P>
<P>
   Let us forget all this nonsense about how The Sun rules the
world. Its threat to Tony Blair to withdraw its support from the
war effort if ground troops were to be deployed should be treated
with total contempt. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (325-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 600) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last week, at the Press Gazette awards, the editor of The Sun
got so miffed that he sat for quite some time on the floor, unaware
that he had fallen off his chair. Beaverbrook he ain't.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean that the argument should not be taken
seriously. Many soldiers' families read The Sun, I imagine. And
common sense suggests that, should we lose dozens of casualties in
a Balkans war, then that bit of opinion in Britain that hasn't
cared much either way so far may decide that this was never our
fight anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Central to The Sun's objection to the risking of British lives
in Kosovo is its perception of those who are not quite so
squeamish. ``Too many armchair generals and media commentators are
calling for force on the ground,'' it said, suggesting, somewhat
surreally: ``Maybe they should go and see the movie `Saving Private
Ryan' to see what a ground war is like.''
</P>
<P>
   Or El Cid, perhaps? This reproof to the supporters of action is
now one that is almost universally used.
</P>
<P>
   In its editorial, the New Statesman states: ``Whether those who
advocate a ground offensive have relatives in the services _ or
whether they would countenance the conscription that might be
required to sustain a long conflict _ is unknown. But the world has
never been short of those willing to send other people's sons to
war.''
</P>
<P>
   And Alan Watkins in The Independent's Sunday sister paper
observes: ``Those with some knowledge of warfare are members of the
Peace Party, whereas the War Party is composed largely of those who
have not even heard a popgun fired in anger.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, I don't find it necessary to slap my weapon on the table
and compare it for size with that of Alan Watkins and the editors
of The New Statesman and The Sun, or anyone else for that matter.
Their jibes are cheap and obvious. &QL;

<P>
   There has been no glorification of war amongst those who have
called for action _ quite the opposite. Those in power in the U.S.,
Britain, Germany, France and Italy are not demagogues or right-wing
populists, but people who grew up opposing the war in Vietnam and
distrusting talk of ``collateral damage.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is one point that the antis make that must be
addressed.
</P>
<P>
   Is this cause, the cause of the Kosovar Albanians, a cause that
is worth suffering for? What would I myself be prepared to
sacrifice in order to stop the massacres and to strike an immense
blow against the politics of racial and ethnic nationalism?
</P>
<P>
   Would I fight, or (more realistically) would I countenance the
possibility that members of my family might die? Would I be
prepared to explain to the mother of a dead soldier why her son had
been killed? Would I accept my children's education being
disrupted, my comfortable lifestyle being altered?
</P>
<P>
   I think so. There are, indeed, some unlikely warmongers around
at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Joschka Fischer, a Green member of the German government, spoke
for a generation of political activists this week. ``When you are
confronted by genocide and mass human suffering,'' he said, ``you
cannot sit with your hands folded and ignore the killing of
innocent civilians. There are certain human values more important
than pacifism.''
</P>
<P>
   So yes, for this cause, if the government asked me to, I'd do
what was necessary without complaining a lot. I can't live with too
much self-disgust. &QL;

<P>
   We pampered Westerners are all very martial as long as we are
only dropping ordnance from the sky.
</P>
<P>
   The air is thick with the stink of attitudinizing. Every
columnist, reporter, letter-writer, pub bore and backbencher knows
what should have been done, and what ought to be done now.
</P>
<P>
   You can sense the determination to be on the right side of
history when you hear them utter sentences beginning with words
like ``it was quite obvious from the beginning that...''
</P>
<P>
   Monday morning, disgracefully, I went back over past pieces that
I have written about Kosovo, hoping that they would show what a
prescient and clever fellow I am, and that they would defend me
from the various charges that those opposed to intervention now
level at those who support it.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes I disgust myself.
</P>
<P>
   What I believe about Kosovo _ that we had little alternative but
to intervene, and that we should now begin to deploy an army
charged with winning it back for its dispossessed people _ is not
the consequence of deep strategic and military insight. It is,
rather, a product of conscience allied to a deep worry about what
would happen elsewhere were we to fail this test.
</P>
<P>
   People on either side of this argument, who proclaim a clear and
almost infallible understanding of cause and effect in the Balkans,
are seeking to mobilize opinion rather than telling the truth.
</P>
<P>
   The desire to be vindicated by events is particularly strong in
those currently in opposition in Britain and America.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of last week, I heard an interview with the Tory
Party chairman Michael Ancram in which he more or less said that
his support for NATO action was dependent upon its eventual
outcome.
</P>
<P>
   In the U.S., the Republican front-runner for the 2000
presidential elections, George W Bush, answered the question about
action with one of his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``My question is: is it good for America?'' said the man from
Texas. ``Right now, as governor, I'm going to figure out how to get
a tax-cut through.''
</P>
<P>
   So if it turns out to be a success, then they are in favor of
it. If it is a catastrophe, then the weedy, liberal focus-groupies
in power in Washington and London will face the justified wrath of
the people.
</P>
<P>
   So far there has been surprisingly little wrath. In Germany,
opinion polls show more than 60 percent in favor of the air
strikes, while in France, there is 58 percent support, including
for the possible use of NATO ground troops. Here in Britain, there
is a big majority in favor of bombing, and a smaller one that
agrees to the use of the army.
</P>
<P>
   Slobodan Milosevic and his colleagues in Belgrade, however, may
well believe that such support is soft. We pampered Westerners are
all very martial as long as we're not taking any casualties and are
dropping ordnance from the sky (he may well tell his generals), but
like Corporal Jones's fuzzy-wuzzies, we don't like it up us, you
know.
</P>
<P>
   And Slobodan Milosevic has to look no further than the gung-ho
British newspaper, The Sun, for some proof. Slapped all over
Monday's page one was the banner headline: ``Don't send our troops
off to die.''
</P>
<P>
   Let us forget all this nonsense about how The Sun rules the
world. Its threat to Tony Blair to withdraw its support from the
war effort if ground troops were to be deployed should be treated
with total contempt. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (325-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 600) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last week, at the Press Gazette awards, the editor of The Sun
got so miffed that he sat for quite some time on the floor, unaware
that he had fallen off his chair. Beaverbrook he ain't.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean that the argument should not be taken
seriously. Many soldiers' families read The Sun, I imagine. And
common sense suggests that, should we lose dozens of casualties in
a Balkans war, then that bit of opinion in Britain that hasn't
cared much either way so far may decide that this was never our

<TEXT>
<P>
   This Friday, somewhere in the world, a historic baby will start
its journey into life. For then _ the 266 days of an average
pregnancy away from the turn of the year _ the first child of the
new millennium will be conceived.
</P>
<P>
   No one will know who or where it is, as it grows towards its
date with destiny spinning gently in its mother's womb. It may be
born rich or poor, male or female, black, brown, yellow or white _
in circumstances as diverse as the wide world itself.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, each time zone will have its own millennium baby, as
the chimes of the new year sound progressively over the spinning
globe.
</P>
<P>
   Industrialized countries, however, are likely to assume an equal
starting point, recognizing the first baby born after its
particular midnight as the landmark child.
</P>
<P>
   They will certainly mount a frenzied search to discover its
identity. Hospital records will be scrutinized and compared to find
out which baby has pipped its rivals to the post.
</P>
<P>
   And _ supposing it survives the lights going out and the
hospital machinery failing, when the millennium bug strikes _ the
chosen child is likely to live with a distinction for life.
</P>
<P>
   But it almost certainly won't be the first. The real millennium
baby is most likely to be born with no clock in sight, with no
record of its time of birth. It may not even live long enough to be
given a name.
</P>
<P>
   For there are nine chances in 10 that it will arrive in the
Third World, rather than in the West _ and four in 10 that it will
be born into extreme poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Its life will differ dramatically depending on how it does in
the lottery of birth, for the gap between the world's richest and
poorest has never been wider.
</P>
<P>
   The wealthiest fifth of the people of the globe are 82 times
better off than the poorest fifth, and account for 88 percent of
the consumption of goods and resources.
</P>
<P>
   Computer ``lapware'' is being developed for the under-ones in
rich countries, while even those lucky enough to go to school in
poor countries often lack books and pencils.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet throws wide the horizons of the wealthy minority,
while more than half the world's people have never even made a
phone call.
</P>
<P>
   New medical techniques are likely soon to be saving American
babies born as early as 19 weeks after conception, while a third of
the children of Niger and Sierra Leone still die before they are
five.
</P>
<P>
   And if the millennium baby does enjoy material prosperity, it
may yet be lonely and unhappy.
</P>
<P>
   On present trends, an American girl will, before long, have more
Barbies than classmates. And alienation increases as family life
shrinks and social and commercial pressures grow: one in every 10
American teenagers has attempted suicide. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 475. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   Below are the very diverse prospects facing the millennium baby
if he or she is born into five different circumstances, from the
hopelessness of the AIDS pandemic now sweeping through Africa, to
the comfort of the wealthy few.
</P>
<P>
   The baby, given a chance, might decide that, at these odds, it
would rather not play.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AIDS BABY: Every year more than 600,000 babies are born HIV
positive _ about 90 percent of them in Africa. In some maternity
wards in that continent one in every four newborns starts life with
the virus. And AIDS is ruining children's lives, even when they
were not infected in the womb.
</P>
<P>
   By next year one in every five children in nine African
countries will have been orphaned by the disease. Deprived of
parental protection, their meager inheritance is often seized by
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Stigmatized by the disease, they frequently end up on the
streets. And even when other families do take them in, they are
often treated harshly.
</P>
<P>
   Half of all AIDS orphans are stunted by malnutrition, and they
are less likely to go to school and more likely to be abused than
other children.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POOREST BABY: One in every four babies is born into extreme
poverty, to families trying to subsist on an income of less than a
dollar a day. Half of all the world's poorest people are children,
and there are more destitute babies than ever before. Most of them
live on the Indian subcontinent.
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide, 12 million die every year from malnutrition and
preventable diseases before they are five. Those who survive
usually grow up stunted both in mind and body from hunger. Their
growth will be sapped by constant bouts of diarrhea, contracted
from having to drink dirty water.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer than two-thirds of them will start school; fewer than
two-thirds of those who do will stay long enough to learn to read
or write. Almost everywhere the baby's prospects will be even worse
if it is born a girl.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DEVELOPING WORLD BABY: Some babies born to the world's poorest
families will have relatively good prospects, for they will live in
countries which have paid particular attention to primary education
and to promoting the health of children and their parents.
</P>
<P>
   Women are 27 times less likely to die in childbirth in Sri Lanka
than in the Ivory Coast, though the two countries have similar per
capita incomes.
</P>
<P>
   Children are only slightly more likely to die in infancy in Cuba
than in the U.S., though Cuba is 24 times poorer.
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabwe almost doubled the proportion of its children starting
school during the 1980s, at a time when national wealth was
actually shrinking.
</P>
<P>
   And countries that have paid particular attention to educating
girls have seen infant deaths and population growth fall, and life
expectancy and economic growth increase.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POOR WESTERN BABY: Last week official Treasury figures showed
that two in every five British babies are born poor; a quarter of
children never escape poverty. It is much the same in the United
States where nearly half of all children live either below the
poverty line or not far above it, and a quarter have difficulty
getting all the food they need.
</P>
<P>
   Inequalities are particularly sharp in Anglo-Saxon countries but
many children live in poverty, even as their contemporaries grow
wealthier, in nearly all rich countries.
</P>
<P>
   Almost everywhere children from ethnic minorities are the worst
off; a baby born at the millennium in the United States can expect
to live nine years less if it is black than if it is white, and
less long than an elder sibling born in 1995. A black American
child is twice as likely to live in poverty as a white one.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PROSPEROUS BABY: Fewer than one in every 10 babies is born into
prosperity to relatively comfortable families in rich countries or
to the wealthy in poor ones. They will be better off than ever.
</P>
<P>
   An American millennium baby can expect to live nearly twice as
long as one born in 1900, and to grow a full 3 inches taller.
</P>
<P>
   A Canadian or Swiss baby now has twice the life expectancy of a
Zambian or Ukrainian one. It will be much more likely than its
parents to get a white-collar job, and, in most countries, to have
a much bigger house.
</P>
<P>
   The average American home is nearly 2,000 square feet, a 25
percent increase since 1977; big family rooms are now about the
size of the 1900 average house. And the rich-country babies'
horizons are expanding dramatically, as computers and the Internet
enter more and more homes. &QL;

<P>
   The wealthiest fifth of the people of the globe are 82 times
better off than the poorest fifth, and account for 88 percent of
the consumption of goods and resources.
</P>
<P>
   Computer ``lapware'' is being developed for the under-ones in
rich countries, while even those lucky enough to go to school in
poor countries often lack books and pencils.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet throws wide the horizons of the wealthy minority,
while more than half the world's people have never even made a
phone call.
</P>
<P>
   New medical techniques are likely soon to be saving American
babies born as early as 19 weeks after conception, while a third of
the children of Niger and Sierra Leone still die before they are
five.
</P>
<P>
   And if the millennium baby does enjoy material prosperity, it
may yet be lonely and unhappy.
</P>
<P>
   On present trends, an American girl will, before long, have more
Barbies than classmates. And alienation increases as family life
shrinks and social and commercial pressures grow: one in every 10
American teenagers has attempted suicide. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 475. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   Below are the very diverse prospects facing the millennium baby
if he or she is born into five different circumstances, from the
hopelessness of the AIDS pandemic now sweeping through Africa, to
the comfort of the wealthy few.
</P>
<P>
   The baby, given a chance, might decide that, at these odds, it
would rather not play.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AIDS BABY: Every year more than 600,000 babies are born HIV
positive _ about 90 percent of them in Africa. In some maternity
wards in that continent one in every four newborns starts life with
the virus. And AIDS is ruining children's lives, even when they
were not infected in the womb.
</P>
<P>
   By next year one in every five children in nine African
countries will have been orphaned by the disease. Deprived of
parental protection, their meager inheritance is often seized by
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Stigmatized by the disease, they frequently end up on the
streets. And even when other families do take them in, they are
often treated harshly.
</P>
<P>
   Half of all AIDS orphans are stunted by malnutrition, and they
are less likely to go to school and more likely to be abused than
other children.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POOREST BABY: One in every four babies is born into extreme
poverty, to families trying to subsist on an income of less than a
dollar a day. Half of all the world's poorest people are children,
and there are more destitute babies than ever before. Most of them
live on the Indian subcontinent.
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide, 12 million die every year from malnutrition and
preventable diseases before they are five. Those who survive
usually grow up stunted both in mind and body from hunger. Their
growth will be sapped by constant bouts of diarrhea, contracted
from having to drink dirty water.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer than two-thirds of them will start school; fewer than
two-thirds of those who do will stay long enough to learn to read
or write. Almost everywhere the baby's prospects will be even worse
if it is born a girl.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DEVELOPING WORLD BABY: Some babies born to the world's poorest
families will have relatively good prospects, for they will live in
countries which have paid particular attention to primary education
and to promoting the health of children and their parents.
</P>
<P>
   Women are 27 times less likely to die in childbirth in Sri Lanka
than in the Ivory Coast, though the two countries have similar per
capita incomes.
</P>
<P>
   Children are only slightly more likely to die in infancy in Cuba
than in the U.S., though Cuba is 24 times poorer.
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabwe almost doubled the proportion of its children starting
school during the 1980s, at a time when national wealth was
actually shrinking.
</P>
<P>
   And countries that have paid particular attention to educating
girls have seen infant deaths and population growth fall, and life
expectancy and economic growth increase.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POOR WESTERN BABY: Last week official Treasury figures showed
that two in every five British babies are born poor; a quarter of
children never escape poverty. It is much the same in the United
States where nearly half of all children live either below the
poverty line or not far above it, and a quarter have difficulty
getting all the food they need.
</P>
<P>
   Inequalities are particularly sharp in Anglo-Saxon countries but
many children live in poverty, even as their contemporaries grow
wealthier, in nearly all rich countries.
</P>
<P>
   Almost everywhere children from ethnic minorities are the worst
off; a baby born at the millennium in the United States can expect
to live nine years less if it is black than if it is white, and
less long than an elder sibling born in 1995. A black American
child is twice as likely to live in poverty as a white one.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PROSPEROUS BABY: Fewer than one in every 10 babies is born into
prosperity to relatively comfortable families in rich countries or
to the wealthy in poor ones. They will be better off than ever.
</P>
<P>
   An American millennium baby can expect to live nearly twice as
long as one born in 1900, and to grow a full 3 inches taller.
</P>
<P>
   A Canadian or Swiss baby now has twice the life expectancy of a
Zambian or Ukrainian one. It will be much more likely than its
parents to get a white-collar job, and, in most countries, to have
a much bigger house.
</P>
<P>
   The average American home is nearly 2,000 square feet, a 25
percent increase since 1977; big family rooms are now about the
size of the 1900 average house. And the rich-country babies'
horizons are expanding dramatically, as computers and the Internet
enter more and more homes. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Instead of admitting the truth about the current Kosovo
conflict, our leaders have consistently lied to us. It has all gone
horribly wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if the initial objectives are recalled, then we have
already lost this war. And it is not only the tragedy of Biblical
proportions on the Balkan mountainsides that proves the futility of
what we have done.
</P>
<P>
   NATO, remember, was supposed to stand by the Rambouillet peace
accords, force Slobodan Milosevic to accept limited autonomy for
Kosovo and end the slaughter and ``ethnic cleansing'' of the Kosovo
Albanians. Then NATO troops were to move into Kosovo in order to
protect the Muslim Albanian and Serb populations.
</P>
<P>
   And what has happened? Rambouillet is in ashes. Serbia is
refusing to budge after 13 days and nights of air raids. Those we
pledged to protect are being driven from their homes in the
greatest act of depopulation in Europe since 1945.
</P>
<P>
   The 12,000 soldiers who were meant to look after the Kosovo
Albanians are now doing just that _ but in the wrong country,
Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   The Serb civilians of Kosovo, whom they were also meant to
protect, are now being bombed by us. The destabilization of the
southern Balkans, which we went to war to prevent, is now well
underway.
</P>
<P>
   And, instead of admitting the truth, our leaders consistently
lie.
</P>
<P>
   At first, we were told that the Serb leader would be forced to
end his ``ethnic cleansing.'' The opposite has happened and now we
are told _ by British Foreign Minister Robin Cook, no less _ that
Milosevic will be made to ``pay the price,'' which is not the same
thing at all.
</P>
<P>
   NATO promised to attack only military targets and, for as long
as it thought it could crack the Serb military, that is what it
did.
</P>
<P>
   But now it is doing just what the Americans did in Iraq _
spreading the war to civilian targets, to bridges and electricity
stations and factories and refineries, under the spurious excuse
that these are also of use to the military.
</P>
<P>
   Of course they are _ just as roads and railway tracks and water
mains are of use to the military. And as we get more desperate,
they may well be the next target.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was never an operation that was planned for only two or
three days,'' NATO's spokesman James Shea told us on March 26.
</P>
<P>
   Really? So why were we not told this before we went to war? Why
were we not told of the possibility of weeks of air raids and the
wholesale abandonment of the Albanian civilian population of Kosovo
if Milosevic did not give in?
</P>
<P>
   Why do we only now learn about the prospect of a ``long war,''
perhaps lasting four years?
</P>
<P>
   And why, for God's sake, did no one _ not President Bill
Clinton, not NATO's Secretary-General Javier Solana, nor Robin
Cook, nor General Wesley Clark _ realize that bombing must be
supported by ground troops?
</P>
<P>
   How on earth did Clark come to believe that the Serbs would give
up so easily? Did he mistake the Yugoslav army for the Serb
militias of Bosnia? Did he think that bullies are always cowards
and will therefore give in? Did he not realize that only a real
threat of ground invasion might force Milosevic to agree to the
Rambouillet accords in time?
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two weeks, we have been told other lies: that it
would have been even worse if NATO had not bombed Serbia _ and that
we knew Milosevic had planned the total ``ethnic cleansing'' of the
Kosovo Albanian population before we went to war.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the first statement _ from President Clinton himself _
is rubbish.
</P>
<P>
   With Serb paramilitaries butchering their way across Kosovo and
poised to drive out every last Albanian, it could not possibly be
worse. And if we knew that Milosevic had planned this, why did NATO
not provide fighting ground troops in those precious weeks
following the original Rambouillet conference?
</P>
<P>
   In the past few days, our defense analysts have been hard at
work to explain the continued war. Not only is it intended to make
Milosevic ``pay the price'' for his brutality, but any faltering
now would damage the credibility of NATO itself.
</P>
<P>
   You bet it would. Almost two weeks ago, we thought we had gone
to war to save the Kosovo Albanians. Now it turns out that we are
at war to save NATO.
</P>
<P>
   And yes, NATO's 50th birthday was this weekend, marked by a
blazing oil refinery, an electricity station burning itself out in
northern Belgrade and hundred of thousands of Kosovo Albanians
freezing on the mountainsides of Montenegro, Albania and Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   We should not be surprised. We asked the Kurds and the Shia
Muslims of Iraq to rise up against Saddam Hussein in 1991 and, when
they did as they were told, we abandoned them to the torture
chambers of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   This time, we asked the Kosovo Albanians to sign the peace
accords in Paris and praised the so-called Kosovo Liberation Army
(KLA). Now they are on the run, we can do no more than bomb the
Serbs from the air. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (300-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 875) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There was a telling moment last week when a senior RAF officer
stood up at NATO's regular briefing to tell journalists that the
KLA ``has not been defeated'' but was ``regrouping'' in order to
``take up the armed struggle'' once again.
</P>
<P>
   What is this nonsense? That a NATO officer should seek to
support the KLA in such a way proved two terrifying things: to the
Serbs, that the KLA was a fifth column (and thus worthy only of
execution) and, to us, that NATO now regards this ragtag bunch of
ill-disciplined ex-Marxists as its foot-soldiers in Kosovo. The
substitute army for the NATO soldiers who will not be sent into
Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO briefings become ever more sinister. At each one, a new
and ever more ghoulish story is produced for journalists _ the mass
execution of intellectuals one day, the rape of young women the
next, the killing of fathers and sons in front of their families,
the setting up of concentration camps.
</P>
<P>
   These stories may well turn out to be true _ I suspect the truth
may be worse _ but the effect is pornography-by-press-conference,
with spokesman ``Jamie'' Shea acting as the East End club doorman
touting the evening's horror story and his RAF colleague playing
the role of manager, promising us that the show will go on.
</P>
<P>
   And so it will until every last Kosovo Albanian has been driven
from his home, or until MI5 or the CIA engineer the secession of
Montenegro or the overthrow of Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   And all the while, the promises continue: ``We shall attack his
murderous forces in Kosovo: we shall strike at the nerve center of
his decision-making machine'' (British Armed Forces Minister Doug
Henderson).
</P>
<P>
   NATO is showing ``unflinching resolve'' in the battle against
the ``unbelievably brutal actions of Milosevic's special police and
army'' (Air Marshal Sir John Day). &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF 300-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tony Blair is suggesting that the Serb leader may face a war
crimes indictment. Do they think Milosevic will be frightened by
all this?
</P>
<P>
   After his supporters killed and raped their way through far more
Muslims in Bosnia than they have in Kosovo, we treated him as a
peacemaker. He was invited to the Dayton conference, he was
regarded by Washington and by the Foreign Office as ``a force for
stability in the Balkans'' (as Saddam was in Iraq after he invaded
Iran).
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic was one of ``our'' dictators _ or at least a man with
whom we could do business.
</P>
<P>
   But now he has joined our list of ``beasts'' _ we remember
Saddam and Qaddafi although, oddly, Osama bin Laden has dropped off
our Satanic radar screens for the present.
</P>
<P>
   We believe Milosevic can be ``defanged'' or ``declawed,'' or
that we can, in the words of the Sun newspaper on the first day of
the war, ``Clobba Slobba.''
</P>
<P>
   Alas, history is not like that. NATO thought that within three
days of its bombing campaign, it would have 200,000 Serbs on the
streets of Belgrade demanding Milosevic's removal. Instead, tens of
thousands of Serbs now gather on those streets for daily pop
concerts to demonstrate their hatred of NATO.
</P>
<P>
   There are many words to encompass the events of the last two
weeks: brutality, vanity, arrogance. But above all, folly is the
word that comes to mind. Maybe we will find another persecuted
population to ``protect'' next year.
</P>
<P>
   They had better watch out. &QL;

regarded by Washington and by the Foreign Office as ``a force for
stability in the Balkans'' (as Saddam was in Iraq after he invaded
Iran).
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic was one of ``our'' dictators _ or at least a man with
whom we could do business.
</P>
<P>
   But now he has joined our list of ``beasts'' _ we remember
Saddam and Qaddafi although, oddly, Osama bin Laden has dropped off
our Satanic radar screens for the present.
</P>
<P>
   We believe Milosevic can be ``defanged'' or ``declawed,'' or
that we can, in the words of the Sun newspaper on the first day of
the war, ``Clobba Slobba.''
</P>
<P>
   Alas, history is not like that. NATO thought that within three
days of its bombing campaign, it would have 200,000 Serbs on the
streets of Belgrade demanding Milosevic's removal. Instead, tens of
thousands of Serbs now gather on those streets for daily pop
concerts to demonstrate their hatred of NATO.
</P>
<P>
   There are many words to encompass the events of the last two
weeks: brutality, vanity, arrogance. But above all, folly is the
word that comes to mind. Maybe we will find another persecuted
population to ``protect'' next year.
</P>
<P>
   They had better watch out. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Instead of admitting the truth about the current Kosovo
conflict, our leaders have consistently lied to us. It has all gone
horribly wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if the initial objectives are recalled, then we have
already lost this war. And it is not only the tragedy of Biblical
proportions on the Balkan mountainsides that proves the futility of
what we have done.
</P>
<P>
   NATO, remember, was supposed to stand by the Rambouillet peace
accords, force Slobodan Milosevic to accept limited autonomy for
Kosovo and end the slaughter and ``ethnic cleansing'' of the Kosovo
Albanians. Then NATO troops were to move into Kosovo in order to
protect the Muslim Albanian and Serb populations.
</P>
<P>
   And what has happened? Rambouillet is in ashes. Serbia is
refusing to budge after 13 days and nights of air raids. Those we
pledged to protect are being driven from their homes in the
greatest act of depopulation in Europe since 1945.
</P>
<P>
   The 12,000 soldiers who were meant to look after the Kosovo
Albanians are now doing just that _ but in the wrong country,
Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   The Serb civilians of Kosovo, whom they were also meant to
protect, are now being bombed by us. The destabilization of the
southern Balkans, which we went to war to prevent, is now well
underway.
</P>
<P>
   And, instead of admitting the truth, our leaders consistently
lie.
</P>
<P>
   At first, we were told that the Serb leader would be forced to
end his ``ethnic cleansing.'' The opposite has happened and now we
are told _ by British Foreign Minister Robin Cook, no less _ that
Milosevic will be made to ``pay the price,'' which is not the same
thing at all.
</P>
<P>
   NATO promised to attack only military targets and, for as long
as it thought it could crack the Serb military, that is what it
did.
</P>
<P>
   But now it is doing just what the Americans did in Iraq _
spreading the war to civilian targets, to bridges and electricity
stations and factories and refineries, under the spurious excuse
that these are also of use to the military.
</P>
<P>
   Of course they are _ just as roads and railway tracks and water
mains are of use to the military. And as we get more desperate,
they may well be the next target.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was never an operation that was planned for only two or
three days,'' NATO's spokesman James Shea told us on March 26.
</P>
<P>
   Really? So why were we not told this before we went to war? Why
were we not told of the possibility of weeks of air raids and the
wholesale abandonment of the Albanian civilian population of Kosovo
if Milosevic did not give in?
</P>
<P>
   Why do we only now learn about the prospect of a ``long war,''
perhaps lasting four years?
</P>
<P>
   And why, for God's sake, did no one _ not President Bill
Clinton, not NATO's Secretary-General Javier Solana, nor Robin
Cook, nor General Wesley Clark _ realize that bombing must be
supported by ground troops?
</P>
<P>
   How on earth did Clark come to believe that the Serbs would give
up so easily? Did he mistake the Yugoslav army for the Serb
militias of Bosnia? Did he think that bullies are always cowards
and will therefore give in? Did he not realize that only a real
threat of ground invasion might force Milosevic to agree to the
Rambouillet accords in time?
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two weeks, we have been told other lies: that it
would have been even worse if NATO had not bombed Serbia _ and that
we knew Milosevic had planned the total ``ethnic cleansing'' of the
Kosovo Albanian population before we went to war.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the first statement _ from President Clinton himself _
is rubbish.
</P>
<P>
   With Serb paramilitaries butchering their way across Kosovo and
poised to drive out every last Albanian, it could not possibly be
worse. And if we knew that Milosevic had planned this, why did NATO
not provide fighting ground troops in those precious weeks
following the original Rambouillet conference?
</P>
<P>
   In the past few days, our defense analysts have been hard at
work to explain the continued war. Not only is it intended to make
Milosevic ``pay the price'' for his brutality, but any faltering
now would damage the credibility of NATO itself.
</P>
<P>
   You bet it would. Almost two weeks ago, we thought we had gone
to war to save the Kosovo Albanians. Now it turns out that we are
at war to save NATO.
</P>
<P>
   And yes, NATO's 50th birthday was this weekend, marked by a
blazing oil refinery, an electricity station burning itself out in
northern Belgrade and hundred of thousands of Kosovo Albanians
freezing on the mountainsides of Montenegro, Albania and Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   We should not be surprised. We asked the Kurds and the Shia
Muslims of Iraq to rise up against Saddam Hussein in 1991 and, when
they did as they were told, we abandoned them to the torture
chambers of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   This time, we asked the Kosovo Albanians to sign the peace
accords in Paris and praised the so-called Kosovo Liberation Army
(KLA). Now they are on the run, we can do no more than bomb the
Serbs from the air. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (300-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 875) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There was a telling moment last week when a senior RAF officer
stood up at NATO's regular briefing to tell journalists that the
KLA ``has not been defeated'' but was ``regrouping'' in order to
``take up the armed struggle'' once again.
</P>
<P>
   What is this nonsense? That a NATO officer should seek to
support the KLA in such a way proved two terrifying things: to the
Serbs, that the KLA was a fifth column (and thus worthy only of
execution) and, to us, that NATO now regards this ragtag bunch of
ill-disciplined ex-Marxists as its foot-soldiers in Kosovo. The
substitute army for the NATO soldiers who will not be sent into
Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO briefings become ever more sinister. At each one, a new
and ever more ghoulish story is produced for journalists _ the mass
execution of intellectuals one day, the rape of young women the
next, the killing of fathers and sons in front of their families,
the setting up of concentration camps.
</P>
<P>
   These stories may well turn out to be true _ I suspect the truth
may be worse _ but the effect is pornography-by-press-conference,
with spokesman ``Jamie'' Shea acting as the East End club doorman
touting the evening's horror story and his RAF colleague playing
the role of manager, promising us that the show will go on.
</P>
<P>
   And so it will until every last Kosovo Albanian has been driven
from his home, or until MI5 or the CIA engineer the secession of
Montenegro or the overthrow of Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   And all the while, the promises continue: ``We shall attack his
murderous forces in Kosovo: we shall strike at the nerve center of
his decision-making machine'' (British Armed Forces Minister Doug
Henderson).
</P>
<P>
   NATO is showing ``unflinching resolve'' in the battle against
the ``unbelievably brutal actions of Milosevic's special police and
army'' (Air Marshal Sir John Day). &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF 300-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tony Blair is suggesting that the Serb leader may face a war
crimes indictment. Do they think Milosevic will be frightened by
all this?
</P>
<P>
   After his supporters killed and raped their way through far more
Muslims in Bosnia than they have in Kosovo, we treated him as a
peacemaker. He was invited to the Dayton conference, he was
regarded by Washington and by the Foreign Office as ``a force for
stability in the Balkans'' (as Saddam was in Iraq after he invaded
Iran).
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic was one of ``our'' dictators _ or at least a man with
whom we could do business.

<P>
   But now he has joined our list of ``beasts'' _ we remember

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The worst drought in 50 years has led Israel to cut
the supply of desperately needed water to Jordan in a move likely
to provoke a crisis in relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   The failure of the winter rains _ only 40 percent of normal in
Israel _ will have a devastating impact on Jordan, which already
suffered a severe water shortage last year.
</P>
<P>
   In Amman, the Jordanian capital, householders found that when
they turned on their taps they received only a trickle of grey
liquid.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very, very serious,'' says Gershon Baskin, director of
the Israel/Palestine Center for Research and Information in
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ``By summer people in Amman may be getting only one or two days
water a week. It is destabilizing for the regime.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel is pledged by treaty to supply Jordan with 45 million
cubic meters of water annually, but has told the Jordanian
government that it can only send 40 percent of this. Israeli
farmers have already had their supply cut by a quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The hills east of Jerusalem, usually carpeted with green grass
and wild flowers at this time of year, are as barren as in high
summer. The government is expected to declare an official drought
this month.
</P>
<P>
   In Jordan the situation is much worse. Its own water resources
are limited. In the east Jordan Valley, the center of Jordanian
agriculture, one of the main canals has grass growing along its
bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the filtration plants at the Amman reservoirs stopped
working leading to toxic water flowing into the supply system.
</P>
<P>
   Baskin, who has studied regional water problems for twenty
years, says: ``For Israel it is an economic issue; for Jordan it is
a survival issue.'' He says that Jordan might lose half its crops
in the east Jordan Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan has rejected outright an Israeli proposal to cut the
water supply. Israeli officials are concerned that the affair may
provoke a crisis in relations between the two countries especially
as the newly-crowned King Abdullah will need to show that he can
deal with the water shortage.
</P>
<P>
   In Israel the government gave the go-ahead earlier in this month
for preliminary studies for a desalination plant. Experts argue,
however, that the problem could be solved by cutting the subsidies
to Israeli agriculture which takes 60 percent of the water in
Israel but produces only two percent of the GDP.
</P>
<P>
   Countries in the Middle East have long quarrelled about water.
Syria is vulnerable to Turkey damming the water of the upper
Euphrates for irrigation and agricultural schemes.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq is dependent on the waters of the Euphrates, which can be
dammed by Syria, and the Tigris which comes from eastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   But Jordan is the most vulnerable country in the region, with
few water resources of its own. The oasis at Azraq east of Amman,
once full of water fowl, is now largely dried mud.
</P>
<P>
   In order to cope with the water crisis it has been draining its
underground aquifers at an unsustainable rate.
</P>
<P>
   Such water resources that it does have are at the upper end of
the Jordan Valley where the Jordan River and the Yarmouk flow into
the sea of Galilee. Under the 1994 peace treaty between Israel and
Jordan the country was to receive extra water from Israel. It is
this which is now being cut.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the first full year when the plan was in operation,
Israel met its obligations. But nobody expected such a serious
drought this year and there are no provisions in the treaty about
what to do if a water shortage affected the whole region.
</P>
<P>
   As with Israel most of the water in Jordan is used in
agriculture, which consumes 68 percent of total supply, while
domestic use is only 28 percent. On other hand Amman, with a third
of the Jordanian population, is expanding fast and using ever more
water. &QL;

ROVING AMBASSADORS TO HIT SEATTLE STREETS

   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEVEN GOLDSMITH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Forty roving ``ambassadors'' will welcome tourists _
and try to keep street people from bothering them _ under a major
new program to make downtown Seattle more visitor-friendly.
</P>
<P>
   Downtown property owners will pay more than $3 million a year
for the program that includes the ambassadors, 24 graffiti removers
and sidewalk sweepers as well as other workers to spruce up
downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Already approved by property owners and likely to win Seattle
City Council OK, the Downtown Business Improvement Area could be
operating by late summer.
</P>
<P>
   The program will replace three smaller districts and also cover,
for the first time, downtown's high-rise midsection.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be new strength in unification,'' said Kate Joncas,
president of the Downtown Seattle Association, which will run the
program.
</P>
<P>
   Modeled after similar operations in Portland, Ore., Baltimore
and Philadelphia, Seattle's program aims to put visitors and local
shoppers at ease in the urban streetscape.
</P>
<P>
   The ambassadors won't be police officers but will wear
distinctive uniforms, Joncas said. They can give tourists a smile
and a map, then steer a homeless, addicted or mentally ill person
to a social agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walking through downtown Seattle can be a challenging
experience,'' says the new program's business plan. ``While some
blocks are clean and secure, others are poorly maintained and
become locations for criminal activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Councilwoman Jan Drago, a strong advocate for the larger
improvement area, said the roving ambassadors will be a bit like
hotel concierges who can guide visitors through unfamiliar terrain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a particularly friendly presence on the street,'' said
Drago, who has made several trips to study Portland's program.
</P>
<P>
   But Gerald Sheehan, legislative director of the American Civil
Liberties Association, said the program should write guidelines for
the ambassadors to avoid stepping on individual rights.
</P>
<P>
   Sheehan said city officials were overly zealous in keeping
dissenters out of view during the 1992 Asia-Pacific Economic
Conference hosted by Seattle, and he worries the new downtown
ambassadors could contribute to such an atmosphere when the World
Trade Organization gathers here in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something we're definitely interested in knowing more
about,'' Sheehan said.
</P>
<P>
   Less controversial are the crews to scour sidewalks every day.
The city now cleans downtown streets but not sidewalks. The workers
also will paint over graffiti and monitor eyesores such as grimy
alleys, burned-out street lights and overflowing trash bins.

   BELGRADE _ If you want to talk to the free press in Belgrade,
hold your breath.
</P>
<P>
   The cigarette smoke in Radomir Diklic's cluttered office is as
thick as fog, great swirling blue wreaths of it that have the
ladies banging open the windows for air above Srpskih Vladara
street.
</P>
<P>
   Diklic smokes himself, of course, a small agitated man with a
potbelly and uncombed hair who breathes through his cigarette until
I am coughing over my notes. But there is a lot to cough about.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had our friends from the Western embassies here,'' he says.
``We had a lot of contacts and we warned them that the day the
first bomb drops, they could count on the fact that everyone will
be for the defense of their country.
</P>
<P>
   ``When our country is attacked, we must defend it _ that's how
we are educated. We told the diplomats this before the war and they
reported this back to their governments. But they said their advice
was overruled by their governments.
</P>
<P>
   ``And you people _ NATO _ did a good job for Slobodan Milosevic.
It was the best present he could be given. For ordinary people,
Milosevic is now a god; when you bombed, he became a symbol of our
country _ which is awful.''
</P>
<P>
   Diklic stops for breath; we all do as we sit around the heavily
scratched round wooden table in the ``Beta'' news agency office,
virtually the only bit left of Yugoslavia's free press.
</P>
<P>
   A new cigarette flips into the Diklic mouth, a new cloud moves
over his face. ``Look at Milosevic's position now. If there's no
bombing of civilian targets, he says `That's good for me.' If there
are no NATO ground troops, he says `That's good for me.' If there's
only bombing with `collateral' damage, well he says, `That's quite
good for me _ and it will give me space to solve the problem of the
KLA.'
</P>
<P>
   ``That's it, do you see? You bomb and we can `clean' out the
south and push out the KLA.''
</P>
<P>
   Diklic is a cynical man _ he deserves to be _ and believes the
Americans are bad partners for Europe in solving European problems,
especially in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   ``They took the side of the KLA after the KLA was almost
destroyed last year. They created (KLA chief Hashem) Thaqi. They
recreated the KLA and pushed aside (Kosovo political leader
Ibrahim) Rugova.
</P>
<P>
   ``And when the Americans went to Rambouillet, there was
cheating. (U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine) Albright gave a piece
of paper to Thaqi saying, `The Americans will have nothing against
a referendum after three years,' and as for the disarmament of the
KLA, (U.S. envoy Christopher) Hill said America would consider the
KLA had disarmed `if we cannot see your arms.'
</P>
<P>
   ``The moment the first bombs dropped and the KLA attacked the
Serbs under the bombs, they were a Fifth Column _ and there is no
mercy for fifth columnists.''
</P>
<P>
   The Diklic view of Kosovo is comparatively simple. President
Milosevic did a favor to Rugova by almost destroying the KLA and
now he is putting Rugova back in the saddle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Milosevic needs Rugova _ because Rugova signed the Rambouillet
agreement and Rugova is now making appeals for peace. Officially,
for the Albanians, Rugova is still `president' of Kosovo. And he
met Milosevic last week _ that film of his meeting was real. He
signed a document.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO is not telling the truth about this being old film. Back
in October, Rugova sat on the right of Milosevic. This time, he was
sitting on the left. Rugova was here.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 150 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 600) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Diklic does not regard Rugova as a corrupt man _ more a tool.
Had Rugova not vetoed Albanian participation in elections,
Milosevic would have lost 23 Kosovo Serb deputies in parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Albanians had voted, they would have got Milosevic out
_ with 1,200,000 Albanian votes, they would have been able to
create the government of Serbia, with an opposition.''
</P>
<P>
   Betrayal is a word that often crops up in Diklic's thoughts. Vuk
Draskovic, the leader of the Serbian Renewal Party (SPO) and one of
the heroes of the opposition revolt two years ago, is condemned
through the cigarette smoke as both vain and prepared to deal with
Milosevic in return for the post of vice-president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Milosevic destroyed his potential enemies inside the
opposition by keeping the SPO and the Radicals in a permanent fight
while Vuk entered a coalition government `to save Serbia.''' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No, Diklic says, NATO is not winning its war.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Yugoslav army are quite professional _ remember that our
country under Tito was prepared for 50 years for attacks. They know
how to defend every single stone in this country and we learned the
lessons of the Iraqis _ we kept our radars switched off.
</P>
<P>
   ``These buildings and barracks that NATO bombs are all empty.
The Americans cannot imagine soldiers who do not go back to their
barracks to wash and eat each night. Our soldiers can sleep for a
month in the woods _ we are not a very hygienic country.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 50 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 875) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Diklic grins. But he has little to smile about. Since the B-92
radio station was closed down by Milosevic _ on the spurious
grounds that its transmitters were stronger than agreed under
license _ the staff of ``Beta'' news are waiting for government
lawyers to turn up at their smoke-shrouded offices. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Diklic wants an end to the bombing. ``If this goes on, all the
small roots of democracy here will be completely destroyed and
Yugoslavia will become a kind of little Korea, although we'll never
starve.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be no peace in the Balkans unless there is a
democratic Serbia. And with the bombing, there can be no
democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   But if it ends? ``If it finishes quickly, Milosevic will have to
agree on something over Kosovo. And when the war stops, all of us
who think differently to Milosevic, we will start to fight again.
One day, someone will have to explain how and why all this
happened.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Bocelli offers too little variety
 &HT;    By Judith Green
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Too bad Andrea Bocelli has priced himself out of the Muzak
market, because that's exactly where his new CD, ``Sogno,''
belongs. In its 14 cuts, the tempos are unchanging, the harmonies
ever-sweet and the poetry full of meaning to the Teletubbies. It's
all pretty, all nice, all the same, and if you can tell one song
from the next, your ears are better than mine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sogno'' is the fourth release by the blind Italian tenor, who
has a pleasant but unspectacular instrument, ideal for pop. (That's
not meant to be derogatory. His vibrato is too fast for opera, and
he doesn't have the chops to fill a hall without amplification.)
Here he's enlisted Celine Dion to join him for ``The Prayer'' from
``Quest for Camelot.'' Italian pop star Eros Ramazzotti comes on
for another song. The only guest that makes her visit memorable is
Dulce Pontes from Brazil, whose husky voice, unsugary part-singing
and idiomatic Portuguese add a welcome bit of spice, until Bocelli
overwhelms her with his patented shtick.
</P>
<P>
   Other than Carole Bayer Sager, who wrote the lyrics to ``The
Prayer,'' perhaps with the aid of refrigerator magnets, the only
recognizable name was that of film composer Ennio Morricone, who
wrote music for two of the indistinguishable songs. None of the
other credits belongs to the guys who wrote the stuff for ``Abba
Pater,'' the new CD by Pope John Paul II. This surprised me. The
music sounds like it all came out of the same can.

   ``Finally''

</P>
<P>
   12 tracks. Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   The news between Blackstreet's last million-selling album and
its latest was that co-founder Teddy Riley was _ once again _
looking for new members. ``Finally'' reveals that not only did
Riley enlist two capable replacements for the R&AMP;B quartet, but he
lifted obvious hunks of other people's records as well. Lazily
incorporated hunks. ``Can You Feel Me'' is the Jacksons' blaring
``Can You Feel It'' with new verses. And DJs can easily mix
Blackstreet's team-up with Janet Jackson, ``Girlfriend/Boyfriend,''
into Cam'ron's ``Horse &AMP; Carriage'' as the tunes share the same
stop-start rhythm. The less-mechanical, involving ballad ``Drama''
is one of too few examples here that Riley, the creator of new jack
swing, can still come up with something imaginative.

</P>
<P>
   Though it lacks the visceral punch of 1996's ``Second Toughest
in the Infants,'' ``Beaucoup Fish'' sounds like the work of a more
introspective and seasoned band. Underworld can still make a
floor-shaking racket, with elastic bass lines, floating keyboard
figures and the often electronically altered voice of Karl Hyde
drifting over clattering percussion tracks. There are moments of
quiet here, too, such as the gentle ``Skym.'' ``Push Upstairs'' and
``King of Snake,'' a twisted take on the repetitive riff of Donna
Summer/Giorgio Moroder's ``I Feel Love,'' come closest to
recapturing the blissed-out groove of the last album's ``Born
Slippy.'' That track's high profile spot in the opening sequence of
``Trainspotting'' sent the group's stock soaring in 1997,
especially in its native Britain. The number of artists purveying
thoughtful dance music has multiplied in the wake of that success,
but few of them do it with the panache of Underworld.

   Mystery and beauty have part in adaptation of `Beloved'
</P>
<P>
   ``Beloved'' (R)
</P>
<P>
   An A-list epic that inadvertently suggests that Toni Morrison's
novels are unfilmable.
</P>
<P>
   Oprah Winfrey plays Sethe, a former slave haunted by the ghost
of her dead daughter, who takes in the mysterious stranger Beloved
(Thandie Newton). The ghoulish, babylike newcomer disrupts a
household that includes Danny Glover as Sethe's lover and Kimberly
Elise as her daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Basically an art-house horror flick whose mysteries are too easy
to guess, the movie (directed by Jonathan Demme) has moments of
intense beauty. But it winds up being too faithful to Morrison's
magic-realist prose; it substitutes mood for emotional power and
narrative clarity. Grade: B-

 &HT;    Mini video reviews
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska, Eleanor Ringel Gillespie and Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QR;  ``American History X'' (R) _ As a young white supremacist
trying to keep his kid brother (Edward Furlong) from being eaten
alive by the racist dogma he once espoused, Edward Norton is
terrific. But the rest of the black-and-white movie preaches to the
converted. Like an ``Afterschool Special'' with skin and swear
words, it's a hopelessly square treatment of a volatile topic.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   _ Steve Murray
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries'' (R) _ Family matters and
more are examined in this thoughtful adaptation of Kaylie Jones'
semi-autobiographical book about growing up in the '60s and '70s
(her father was writer James Jones). The vignette-ish approach may
bother some _ the movie is like a personal memoir divided into
three short stories _ but the film's sense of memory as an
emotional tapestry rings true. Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   _ Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``I Still Know What You Did Last Summer'' (R) _ Tepid
follow-up to last year's surprise hit, this teen slasher flick
transplants surviving cast member Jennifer Love Hewitt to an island
in the Bahamas. Back-from-the-dead killer Ben Willis is there too,
intent on using his deadly fishhook hand to finish off Julie and
her friends. Teenage singer and TV star Brandy is the only spirited
thing about this sequel. Grade: C

 &HT;    Expect surprises from maverick Robert Altman
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   You may not like every Robert Altman movie you see, but it's
unlikely that you'll forget one. A bona fide Hollywood maverick who
has managed to stay in the game _ or, perhaps more accurately, just
outside the game _ for 40 years, Altman continues to surprise us.
His newest film, ``Cookie's Fortune,'' opens Friday. A
magnolia-scented Deep South whimsy, ``Cookie's'' is just another
reminder that with Altman, best expect the unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of an Essential Altman is probably an oxymoron, but
here are some other titles you might want to check out on video:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``MASH'' (1970).
</P>
<P>
   The movie that put Altman _ and, by extension, Alan Alda _ on
the map. Set in a Mobile Army Surgical Hospital during the Korean
War, the movie is full of parallels to Vietnam and takes its
nose-thumbing tone from the anti-war fever that swept campuses in
the late 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Sutherland and Elliott Gould play the original Korean
cutups with an appealingly anachronistic countercultural panache. A
prize winner with critics' groups and at Cannes (not to mention
five Oscar nominations), ``MASH'' was the right movie at the right
time.
</P>
<P>
   Unexpected face: Yep, that's Robert Duvall as our anti-heroes'
nemesis, Maj. Frank Burns.
</P>
<P>
   Behind-the-scenes weirdness: The producers originally wanted
Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau for the leads. They were dissuaded
by the argument that the football finale called for younger stars.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``McCabe and Mrs. Miller'' (1971).
</P>
<P>
   Warren Beatty is McCabe, a pretty good gambler, a pretty
transparent braggart and a pretty bad entrepreneur. Julie Christie
is Mrs. Miller, a no-nonsense madam who drives hard bargains and
finds refuge in an opium pipe. They come together in Altman's
radiant dream of the American West, a place bathed in gold and
white and a mournful Leonard Cohen soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got poetry in me,'' insists Beatty's McCabe. So does this
movie.
</P>
<P>
   Unexpected face: Rene Auberjonois of ``Star Trek: Deep Space
Nine'' plays the sneaky barkeep who goes into business with McCabe.
</P>
<P>
   Behind-the-scenes weirdness: Gould was originally considered for
McCabe, but Beatty's name was the only way to guarantee financing.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Nashville'' (1975).
</P>
<P>
   Arguably Altman's best-known film. A kind of deadpan social
study of the country music scene, the movie is actually a
scathingly hilarious and oddly poignant report on the state of the
nation circa the mid-1970s. All the trademark Altman-isms are
firmly in place: the revealing vignettes instead of a strictly
structured plot; the half-heard overlapping dialogue; the large
cast of eccentric characters bumping into one another in unexpected
ways, etc. Among the faces in the crowd: Lily Tomlin, Henry Gibson,
Keith Carradine, Geraldine Chaplin, Karen Black, Ned Beatty and
Scott Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   Unexpected face: The ubiquitous and somewhat mysterious
motorcycle rider is Jeff Goldblum, who would later battle dinosaurs
in ``Jurassic Park'' and help save the world in ``Independence
Day.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind-the-scenes weirdness: Former President Nixon once wrote
Altman a note saying that ``Nashville'' was his daughter Tricia's
favorite movie and could he please have a copy for her.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Player'' (1992).
</P>
<P>
   Altman has Hollywood for lunch _ with a nice Chianti _ in this
devilishly wicked comedy about the brown-nosing and back-stabbing
that pass for business as usual in the movie biz. Studded with more
than 60 celebrity cameos _ everyone from Burt Reynolds to Bruce
Willis _ the film centers on an ambitious studio executive (Tim
Robbins) whose problems include an equally ambitious rival (Peter
Gallagher) and a series of threatening postcards from a disgruntled
writer. Behind the glittery dish is a dark vision of an America
disastrously hooked on the superficial.
</P>
<P>
   Unexpected face: Buck Henry, co-writer of ``The Graduate,'' is
briefly glimpsed pitching ``The Graduate 2.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind-the-scenes weirdness: The original choice for Robbins'
role was Chevy Chase.

`STRANGERS WITH CANDY': SWEET SORROW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TIM GOODMAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Comedy may not be pretty but the one thing it
absolutely must be is funny. If it's not, you might as well be
watching ``The NewsHour'' on PBS.
</P>
<P>
   Comedy Central is under a unique kind of pressure in that the
channel has to be funny. The cable channel succeeded tremendously
with ``South Park'' and several other wonderful and supremely
twisted shows. See, that's the thing about comedy. Being twisted,
being swathed in a blanket of irony, being so hip as to be nearly
unfunny is what passes for brilliant comedy these days.
</P>
<P>
   Bearing this burden, Comedy Central offers us ``Strangers with
Candy,'' the channel's latest effort in translating weird into
funny. Unfortunately, it doesn't translate very well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strangers with Candy'' is about a 46-year-old woman named
Jerri Blank (``Second City'' alum Amy Sedaris), who comes back home
after 32 years as a runaway ``user, boozer and loser'' and
re-enrolls in high school as a freshman.
</P>
<P>
   That's pretty original for starters and offers up a great deal
of hope, but was squashed like a grape in the pilot and barely
allowed to surface in the second episode, if anyone isn't too bored
to come back after squandering the first 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps part of what's so defeating about watching ``Strangers
with Candy'' is realizing the wasted potential. A 46-year-old
hardened woman goes back to high school? Sign us up for 13
episodes. But the writing isn't there. Sedaris' portrayal is
spot-on and often times mesmerizing to look at _ her Tammy Faye
Bakker make-up and faux-Muppet overbite getting visual laughs many
times on their own.
</P>
<P>
   After 15 minutes of staring at her, you need writing. And
``Strangers with Candy'' simply plays as one extended ``Saturday
Night Live'' spoof on that most easy of TV targets, the
after-school special.
</P>
<P>
   Each episode ends with some kind of skewed lesson _ like ``South
Park'' _ and then moves the next week into new territory. The
pilot, about drug abuse and acceptance, defies you to laugh its
broadness, it's spoofiness, its coolness for pricking the
clueless-parent approach of all those retro TV specials.
</P>
<P>
   But it's just not funny. It's loud and brash and stupid and _
like a lot of ``SNL'' skits _ painfully long, and it implodes upon
itself.
</P>
<P>
   What this show looks most like is a brilliant kids show on
Nickelodeon, the late, lamented ``Adventures of Pete and Pete.''
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, ``Strangers with Candy'' was a good idea on paper but
never graduates to something better.

and their children are not at increased risk for any type of defect

YUGOSLAVIA LOOMED LARGE IN ALBRIGHT'S YOUTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID BEARD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hounded by the two biggest oppressors of the century, Nazism and
Communism, Madeleine K. Albright's family turned twice to the
Balkans for help.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my country was occupied by the Germans,'' her father once
wrote, ``my first thought of safety went to Yugoslavia.''
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavs gave Albright's father, Josef Korbel, letters saying
they had worked for him in Belgrade _ and smuggled the Jewish
family away from the Nazis and the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   After World War II, Yugoslavia again provided a refuge for
Korbel and his family from the political struggle in their native
Czechoslovakia, where totalitarianism triumphed again with a
Communist takeover in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Madeleine, the little girl who spent her infancy in
Belgrade and several childhood years there later _ swimming in the
Sava River, taking walks through Kalemegdan Park with her governess
_ is the US secretary of state _ and the driving force behind the
US bombing of the Balkan nation.
</P>
<P>
   Her family's experience with oppression in Europe, biographers
say, has forged her determination to roll back the persecution of
ethnic Albanians by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   For a decade, she has lambasted Milosevic for human rights
abuses in the splintered Balkan nation, prompting him in one 1997
face-to-face exchange in Belgrade to challenge her knowledge of his
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Madame Secretary, you are not well informed,'' Milosevic told
her in an exchange recounted in Ann Blackman's 1998 biography,
``Seasons Of Her Life.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright shot back: ``Don't tell me I'm not uninformed _ I lived
here.''
</P>
<P>
   But Albright's years in the country _ and its role in saving her
family _ have irritated people who now must live under the
bombardment she has forcefully advocated, said Michael Dobbs, whose
biography ``Madeleine Albright: A Twentieth-Century Odyssey'' is
being released later this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Serbs dislike her intensely now, and one of the things
they raise is they helped out her family when it was in trouble,''
Dobbs said from Budapest, on his way back into Yugoslavia to report
for the Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   ``They feel it is a lack of gratitude,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   She was brought to Belgrade shortly after her birth in 1937. Her
father worked as the press attache for the Czechoslovak Embassy. He
was fired because of his Jewish origins after Nazis surged to
control following the 1938 Munich accord, in which the Western
powers acquiesced to Hitler's demand for one-third of
Czechoslovakia.
</P>
<P>
   After being spirited to safety, unlike many relatives who were
killed in Nazi death camps, Albright returned to Belgrade after her
father's appointment in late 1945 as the new Czechoslovak
ambassador to Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   To her father, it meant safety from the increasing divisions in
his homeland between the social democrats and the communists. It
meant a high-profile life hosting parties for the nation's
leadership, including one gala attended by socialist Josip Broz
Tito, the man who unified Yugoslavia for decades through his iron
rule.
</P>
<P>
   For 8-year-old Madeleine, who donned native Czechoslovak dress
for several embassy events, the years represented a style of luxury
she would not see for decades as an emigre, first to Britain and
then to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very heady time for her, but also a very lonely
time,'' said Blackman. ``She had a governness and servants, but few
friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Her strict father maintained a steady tutoring schedule and
shipped Madeleine off to private school in Switzerland when she was
10. On her return in 1997, she said the only room she could recall
in her former embassy mansion was the bathroom, where she had often
been banished for misbehavior.
</P>
<P>
   In 1948, as political divisions inside Czechoslovakia deepened,
Josef Korbel came to understand that he could never return to his
homeland under communist rule. Facing a recall home after the
Communist takeover, he accepted a position with the UN committee
seeking to enforce a cease-fire in the Kashmir region of India and
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Settling in the United States, Korbel wrote histories of
Czechoslovakia and of Tito's Yugoslavia, where he said he first
witnessed the suffocating nature of communism.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, Korbel, an academic at the University of Denver,
initially supported the war in Vietnam by arguing the domino theory
_ that tyranny and communism would spread if allowed to bloom in
the Southeast Asian land. In recent weeks, according to Pentagon
officials, Albright has used a similar metaphor in demanding the US
military's help in ending the Serb oppression in Yugoslavia's
Kosovo region.
</P>
<P>
   In the early '90s, Albright, as US ambassador to the United
Nations, had similar battles with a reluctant Pentagon, urging
intervention in Bosnia. Eventually her view won out, and the US
military played a limited role in overseeing an end to the mass
killings in that Balkan region.
</P>
<P>
   ``She absorbed a lot from her parents,'' Dobbs said. ``In
Munich, this idea of giving in to dictators, that you should draw
the line before it was too late, that this should happen never
again _ all this comes to mind with the style she has used, first
as UN ambassador and now as secretary of state. Her rhetoric has
become the administration's rhetoric.''

   BLACE, Macedonia _ Not surprisingly, Dr. Tom Durant volunteered
for the midnight shift.
</P>
<P>
   For most of his 70 years, Durant has been inserting himself into
the worst the world has to offer. So it was almost inevitable that
as dawn broke over this wretched corner of earth Tuesday, Tom
Durant was attending to one of the 50,000 refugees from Kosovo
stranded in a huge, muddy field.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a good night,'' said Durant, assistant director at
Massachusetts General Hospital and a longtime volunteer for the
American Refugees Committee. ``Nothing dramatic. A lot of
dehydration, hysteria, we had IVs going. Vomiting, diarrhea, some
serious leg and foot infections, a heart attack. But nobody died on
us, thank God.''
</P>
<P>
   As many as 65,000 people have been cooped up in this squalid
pen, surrounded by armed guards, for up to a week while the
Macedonian government refused to allow them into cleaner, more
orderly camps. Now, says Durant, buses are taking some of the
refugees the government is allowing out to the new camps.
</P>
<P>
   The field that people have taken to calling No Man's Land
presents what Durant and other doctors here describe as a
humanitarian disaster waiting to happen. Doctors say that unless
the bulk of refugees are moved from the field in the next day or
two, disease is likely to begin killing them in droves.
</P>
<P>
   As bad as it is, Durant said he was encouraged by what he saw
overnight. But, as he observed while commiserating with a
colleague, Dr. Sheri Fink from the Boston-based Physicians for
Human Rights, ``there are tens of thousands of refugees still in
Kosovo, waiting to cross the border. Once we move this crowd out,
we've got another one right in back of them.''
</P>
<P>
   As Durant put it, ``the longer they stay, it's a potentially
explosive situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Fink, 30, a recent medical school graduate who is attending
refugees for the first time, said she admires Durant, who is
well-known in the small circle of physicians who volunteer their
services whenever there is an international human itarian crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been everywhere,'' she said. ``I want to do the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Durant's volunteer resume reads like a chronology of all
that is wrong with the world _ Vietnam, Cambodia, Afghanistan,
Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Rwanda, Bosnia, Honduras, and now here.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is bad, but Goma was the worst thing I ever saw,'' he
said of the Rwandan refugee camp. ``We had 50,000 dead in two weeks
from cholera. Here, it's dysentery and measles we have to watch out
for. The measles in Cambodia in 1980 were unreal.''
</P>
<P>
   Durant made his rounds dressed in blue jeans, a windbreaker,
and, for here at least, a distinctive Red Sox cap. Spying a visitor
from Boston as he tended to an old woman, he asked hopefully,
``How'd the Sox make out on opening day?'' But, turning back to his
patient, he answered his own question mournfully, ``No one here
knows, or cares.''
</P>
<P>
   Durant comforted a pregnant woman who shivered with fear, not
cold.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's petrified,'' he explained, offering her a hand on her
shoulder and soothing words in the little Albanian he knows. ``She
got separated from her husband, which is common here. This is her
first baby, and the poor girl is simply terrified.''
</P>
<P>
   Reporters and analysts try to put the recurring tragedy of the
Balkans into some unique perspective. But where he sat, on a muddy
chair in a fetid tent with hypodermic needles strewn about, Tom
Durant saw only the human condition, unique to no one and nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``This situation is like every other I've seen over the years,''
he said, pouring gasoline into a generator that kept the tent
lights on all night. ``It's a case of the three Bs, and I don't
mean Bach, Beethoven, and Brahms.''
</P>
<P>
   Durant's three B's are bureaucracy, banditry, and baksheesh, or
corruption. The bureaucracy has seen Macedonians refuse to process
the refugees in large numbers, leaving them to stew in their own
squalor. The baksheesh has forced refugees to pay police for the
right to flee their homes. And the banditry has seen refugees
robbed of their possessions, their identity papers, and, in the
end, their dignity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Follow me,'' Durant said, wiping his hands, leading the way to
a place he calls the Tent of the Damned.
</P>
<P>
   He pulled back the flap to reveal two dozen people, most of them
elderly, some of them mentally retarded.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one wants these people,'' he said. ``There are no
organizations, no institutions to take them in.''
</P>
<P>
   The elderly, many of them suffering from dementia, babbled
incoherently. The retarded sat there, saying nothing, some of them
rocking gently.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what would become of these people, Durant let the flap go
and said, ``I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other volunteers here, Durant has an extraordinary ability
to focus on the things he can change and not be overwhelmed by
those he can't.
</P>
<P>
   He and the other doctors are providing battlefield triage and
engaging in emotional triage, with their patients, among
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Durant said he has to adopt an attitude to survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The border guards here beat the shit out of people and
intimidate the docs. They're almost as bad as the Serbs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His old friend, the former Boston Herald political columnist
Peter Lucas, taught him some Albanian, concentrating on swear
words, a skill Durant dispenses liberally here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very important to be able to swear in the local language.
It establishes instant credibility,'' he explained, examining a
woman suffering from bronchitis.
</P>
<P>
   The Macedonian police and special forces are a surly lot,
frequently and arbitrarily denying access to the field. Durant, who
attended Boston College and Georgetown Medical School, spent a year
at the Harvard School of Public Health. He has been flashing his
Harvard ID card, and for some inexplicable reason, it keeps
disarming the unsmiling guards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hmmmmm, Hah-vud,'' a guard said Monday, waving Durant through,
apparently impressed, although his tone didn't suggest as much.
</P>
<P>
   Durant, who plans to stay here at least another week, said he
will continue volunteering his skills, wherever they are needed. He
finds a strange, inner peace in places like Blace. It puts his own
problems in perspective. It offers larger lessons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the proof of Original Sin, of good vs. evil, of man's
inhumanity to man,'' he said. ``But the most striking thing is that
this shows the resilience of the human spirit. Despite all that you
see here, there are still people who can laugh, who can show
kindness to others.''
</P>
<P>
   He also confessed to a selfish interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets me away from the horrible bureaucracy back home,'' he
said. ``There are many terrible things here, but there are no
lawyers.''
</P>
<P>
   As the sun rose Tuesday, Durant stood outside on ground strewn
with trash and refugees who worried for their loved ones in the
tents. An indescribable stench wafted over from the nearby river
that refugees are using as an open toilet.
</P>
<P>
   He was supposed to be relieved at 8 a.m., to catch some sleep
before returning to the camp to help out and to take another
midnight shift. But his replacement was late, and it wasn't long
before Dr. Luan Jaha, the local doctor running the clinic, poked
his head through the flap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom,'' he said, almost apologetically. ``I need you.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Durant, bleary-eyed but sure of purpose, ducked into the
tent.

DOW HOOPLA MASKS LACKLUSTER RETURNS FOR MOST FUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Dow climbs to 10,000, scaling a peak that only months ago
seemed a mirage in the clouds. So where are the thrills of the
summit for mutual fund investors?
</P>
<P>
   Many stock funds had so-so or disappointing returns last
quarter, with only those invested in a handful of the biggest
blue-chip companies or whiz-bang Internet and technology shares
joining the popular Wall Street benchmark in the climb.
</P>
<P>
   Over the first three months of 1999, growth funds, which invest
in large-company shares, gained 4.4 percent; funds mimicking the
blue chip-rich Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index rose 4.8 percent; and
those focused on science, technology, and telecommunications gained
anywhere from 16.4 percent to 17 percent, according to fund
tracking firm Lipper Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Those were the happy stories. Funds invested in just about
anything else got left at base camp.
</P>
<P>
   Those devoted to small companies backslid, losing nearly 6
percent. Indeed, in a quarter in which the Dow Jones industrial
average rose a heady 6.6 percent, closing above 10,000 for the
first time on March 29, the average US diversified stock fund
gained only a skimpy 0.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The chasm between funds doing well and those performing poorly
provides a glimpse into the strange new terrain of the stock
market, whose landscape is increasingly one of a few spectacular
peaks and many low valleys. ``This continues to be a large cap
environment, and there's a clear dichotomy between the winners and
the losers,'' said David Corkins, who runs the $464 million Janus
Growth &AMP; Income fund.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence of the gap is everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Lipper said last quarter marked the largest outperformance of
growth funds over their small-cap brethren since the firm began
tracking funds in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   That outperformance-gap is also evident within large caps.
According to Laszlo Birinyi, an investment consultant in Greenwich,
Conn., fully 82 percent of the S&AMP;P 500's decent gain last quarter
came from only 10 stocks, including Microsoft Corp. and America
Online Inc. (The other 490 stocks in the index, which comprises the
country's biggest companies by market capitalization, did not gain
much.)
</P>
<P>
   The US stock market's narrowing of gainers comes as the domestic
economy stands tall and proud. Record-low inflation, declining
interest rates, and cost-cutting measures at corporations have all
pushed market indexes higher over the eight years since Wall
Street's recordlong bull market began.
</P>
<P>
   While fund investors have shuddered at Wall Street's volatility
in previous months and fretted overseas economic crises, they have
not forsaken equity fund investing. Americans now have an estimated
$5.6 trillion invested in mutual funds of all stripes, according to
the Investment Company Institute.
</P>
<P>
   So it is ironic that investors earned more last quarter from
money market funds _ about 1 percent _ than from the average
diversified stock fund. The average long-term bond fund returned
only 0.2 percent, below previous levels.
</P>
<P>
   Chasing performance, ordinary investors are pouring increasing
amounts of cash into the large-cap and tech-heavy funds that are
hogging all the gains. After sitting on the sidelines in February,
investors plowed a hefty $26.4 billion of new cash into stock funds
last month, the most in nearly a year, according to Trimtabs.com
Investment Research.
</P>
<P>
   At Boston-based Fidelity Investments, the nation's biggest
mutual fund firm, top sellers so far this year are all focused on
large-company stocks and include Blue Chip Growth, Fidelity Fifty,
Dividend Growth, and Magellan, according to Financial Research Corp
in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Such a trend suggests that investors may be less enthused about
one of investing's crystal-clear rules: diversification. After all,
the market seems to be saying, what's the point of spreading one's
eggs into multiple baskets if only a few hold the golden ones?
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody wants diversification in this kind of rip-roaring
market,'' said Charles B. Carleson, who comanages the Dow 30 Value
fund at Strong-Corneliuson Capital Management in Milwaukee. ``But
it's not a policy that should be abandoned.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, long-battered funds invested in Latin American,
Japanese, and Pacific region stocks all roared back last quarter.
(By contrast, Europe was no fun at all, with funds focused on that
area losing 2.6 percent.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, investors _ who increasingly use mutual funds to save for
retirement _ might be forgiven for finding less reason to diversify
when they open their quarterly statements.
</P>
<P>
   Growth and income funds, which include value stocks, or shares
deemed good bargains, gained a piddly 1.8 percent last quarter.
Equity income funds, focused on companies paying dividends, shed
0.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Among sector funds, which concentrate on specific industries,
natural resource funds made a comeback with an average 7 percent
gain. On the other side were utility funds, which lost 3 percent,
and real-estate funds, which shed 4.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Not all industry watchers find the stock market's increasing
narrowness cause for concern. In a recent research note,
PaineWebber Inc. sought to debunk what it termed two myths about
the reign of a narrow group of large-caps and the appetite of
ordinary investors and fund managers alike for those stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The notion that large-cap stocks are doing well simply because
everybody is piling willy-nilly into the S&AMP;P 500 (mostly via index
funds such as the Vanguard Index 500) doesn't make sense,
PaineWebber said, because only a few S&AMP;P 500 stocks are doing well.
In other words, with far from all stocks in the index posting
gains, the general ``indexation'' phenomenon cannot be used to
explain the S&AMP;P's performance.
</P>
<P>
   Second, while it is possible that huge companies are
outperforming everything else simply because they are household
names investors like or liquid issues portfolio managers can easily
trade, there is another explanation for large caps' reign. Such
stocks are growing, PaineWebber wrote, not just because investors
are blindly pushing them up but because they have relatively strong
price-earnings expansion and relatively strong earnings. In other
words, high-performing large caps are growing on their own merits,
and are not just a fad (popular though they may be).
</P>
<P>
   That suggests investors are behaving rationally, not blindly, by
piling into funds that hold them.
</P>
<P>
   Still, investors might not want to get so excited.
</P>
<P>
   PaineWebber sees the Dow _ and, by extension, the S&AMP;P 500, which
historically correlates closely with its cousin-benchmark _ due for
a 5-to-15 percent correction sometime later this year. If that
happens, mutual fund investors pondering the zeniths and nadirs in
their forthcoming statements might find diversification appealing
after all.

   MONGIARDINO-DESIGN (Milan) _ Few outsiders were ever allowed
into the private world of the late Renzo Mongiardino, the legendary
interior designer. By many visitors to next week's furniture fair
here will be making a pilgrimage to the dour Palazzo Crivelli in
the center of the city, where Mongiardino's genius is being feted
prior to its final disbursement. By Mitchell Owens.

<P>
   ACCONCI-ARCHITECTURE (New York) _ It is hard to reconcile the
quiet figure of Vito Acconci, aspiring architect, with the swath he
has cut as an artist over the last 30 years. Acconci, the enfant
terrible emeritus of the downtown art world, is using his
increasingly housebroken art to put a humane spin on contemporary
architecture. By Philip Nobel.

   With phto.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-LOGO (Undated) _ Even wars have logos these days, at
least on television, and the coverage of the Kosovo war invariably
features the Albanian eagle, splashed across the screen like the
NBC peacock. The Albanian eagle, angular, Gothic, almost medieval
in style, with its two heads and dragonlike claws, seems to sum up
the ancient nature of the conflicts in the Balkans _ and the fears
Americans have of an area they don't understand. It's a feathered
version of all the fears of foreign entanglements we've worried
about since Washington's Farewell address. By Phil Patton.
</P>
<P>
   MOTORCOACH-RESORT (Undated) _ A few miles, as the pelican flies,
from the warm green waters of the Gulf of Mexico, tan bodies
gathered round a patio table. The conversation paused when an
engine rumble neared. A new neighbor was moving onto Southern
Breeze Drive. ``Nice,'' Kraig Brechbuhler said as the newest home
on the block rolled by, its burgundy-and-gold sides sparkling in
the noon sun. In the gated community known as Pelican Lake
Motorcoach Resort, not only do the neighbors come and go, but so
also do the homes. No Winnebagos here, however. This resort is
exclusively for luxury motor coaches, most of them longer than 37
feet. They look like tour buses for rock stars. By Diane Ketcham.

   GARDEN-COLOR (Undated) _ Garden fashion is fickle: It used to be
perennials versus annuals. Then it was pastels versus hot, read
vulgar, colors. Now that beginning gardeners have learned what a

garden colors, it's time for another category of plants to elbow
its way into the garden. By Mac Griswold.

NATO AT 50: NO FESTIVITIES AMID CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AVIANO AIR BASE, Italy _ NATO's 50th anniversary was supposed to
be a bright, shining moment.
</P>
<P>
   But at the nerve center of the NATO airstrikes against
Yugoslavia, this week's scheduled commemorations of the
half-century since the birth of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization have been called off.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're focusing on the work at hand,'' said US Air Force Major
Scott Vadnais at the command center of the base, as preparations
continued for intensifying air missions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're too busy for any fancy dinners,'' he added, as pilots
strutted down a corridor with American, Canadian, Spanish, and
British markings on their gray flight suits.
</P>
<P>
   The ``work at hand'' has taken this 19-nation alliance into
unexplored military and political terrain, and the conflict in
Kosovo has crystallized NATO's struggle to find its way in the
post-Cold War world. At age 50, NATO is having a mid-life crisis at
a very busy time.
</P>
<P>
   Established on April 4, 1949, NATO's stated mission was to
answer the threat to European security posed by the Soviet Union.
After the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, NATO was left without a
clear enemy, and without a clear mission.
</P>
<P>
   Now NATO has for the first time attacked a sovereign nation, in
what critics fear is a dangerous expansion of its mandate. But
supporters of the mission in Kosovo say it is a necessary, onetime
response to a unique situation, and that it is too early to say
NATO has structurally changed as a result.
</P>
<P>
   In less than three weeks, the leaders of the alliance are set to
meet in Washington for a summit that will focus on redefining NATO
and its goals for the next century. There, the key issue will be
whether NATO will continue to maintain its defensive posture or
transform itself into a global policing role _ fighting terrorism,
the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and containing
conficts in the Balkans and elsewhere that could spill into Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is precisely what NATO should be doing,'' said Helmut
Sonnenfeldt, an expert on European military affairs at the
Brookings Institution in Washington. ``We are in unprecedented
times, so we are going to see unprecedented moves taken by the
alliance.''
</P>
<P>
   But NATO should be careful not to go too far in redefining its
role when the alliance leaders meet, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mandate should not be tampered with. They should continue
to assess their role in a case-by-case basis,'' he said. ``If they
officially expand its role to protect Europe against `legitimate'
threats, there will be serious divisions over how to define the
`legitimacy' of a threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``For example, would it include Iraq, where most of Europe
receives oil. What about Iran? This will get very difficult and is
fraught with problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Spurgeon Keeny, a senior member of the National Security Council
staff in the Kennedy and Johnson administrations and head of the
Washington-based Arms Control Association, is also wary of the
``new NATO.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It poses a grave concern and will put great strain on the
alliance. The current crisis in Kosovo is not what disturbs me, but
the ripple effect of an expanded NATO. I'm worried about what it
will do to our relations with Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   The massive Aviano air base, which has 3,500 personnel,
exemplifies the best of NATO's international makeup. There's an
Italian mess hall with a pasta buffet, a British pub that serves
Guinness, a Greek souflaki stand, and just about everyone flocks to
the Spanish mess tent for paella on Thursdays. And of course there
is an eclectic mix of Americana _ from junk food to classical jazz
on the radio station. People seem to get along.
</P>
<P>
   Not that cultural differences don't cause problems. American
officers are perturbed that their Canadian subordinates refuse to
salute them. And Spanish and Italian officers are furious that
American officers permit television news cameras on the base, which
they see as a dangerous breach of security.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Aviano refuse to give out the exact breakdown of
different nationalities, but a tour of the base makes it clear that
the nearly 150 fighter jets are almost all made in the United
States. And the personnel seems to be at least 70 percent American.
</P>
<P>
   The base seems to embody both the changes in NATO as it
redefines itself and the cumbersome political and diplomatic
structure that sometimes blurred its mission in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole way of doing business has changed,'' said Captain
Edward Thomas, who has been at Aviano on-and-off since 1995, ``a
transition from an on-call and stationary force to an expeditionary
force that is light, lean, and lethal, and capable of deploying in
hot spots quickly . . . times have changed, so we have to change
with them.''
</P>
<P>
   But interviews with several senior officials from the United
States and two European countries suggest that the changes at the
base have also brought rising tensions, as the understanding of
NATO's mission diverges among some of the alliances members.
</P>
<P>
   It can cost officers their jobs if they criticize NATO publicly.
But in private, many of them, American as well as European, express
frustration with the layers of bureaucracy and interlocking chains
of command, saying they limit their ability to do their job
effectively. And then there are broader issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some fear that NATO is going to become an extension
of America's global interests,'' said a senior officer in a
European squadron of fighter jets, who spoke on the condition that
his name and nationality not be used. ``That is something forces on
base worry about.''
</P>
<P>
   But a senior American officer who has spent most of the last 12
years stationed at NATO bases in Germany, England, and Turkey said
he welcomed the changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about time we cleared up the role of NATO,'' he said.
``We've been adrift too long. So I say it's about time we did
something.''
</P>
<P>
   In general, Europeans seem less comfortable with the new NATO,
especially with its role in the Balkans _ the fuse that helped
ignite two world wars. There is widespread resentment against the
United States, which many perceive as an arrogant superpower having
its way in Europe under the cover of a united NATO.
</P>
<P>
   To many who gather daily outside the air base, the Aviano-based
US Marine pilots who severed a ski area's gondola cable and killed
20 people represent the recklessness of an American-led NATO. That
resentment found expression in violence this week when a group
calling itself ``The Anti-imperialist Terrorist Cell'' claimed
responsibility for bombing a car that carried American military
markings. The group has conducted other sporadic attacks since
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Every night since the Kosovo crisis began, people have arrived
outside the main gate by the hundreds to watch _ and by the dozens
to protest _ the American-made Stealth fighters and F-16s that roar
off toward their targets in Yugoslavia, about 200 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Families set up lawn chairs, and others lean against the wooden
fence that separates the air base from the surrounding farmland.
</P>
<P>
   Anna Barbera, 26, an English literature student, said she came
because ``war is not only an image on TV, but very real.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are horrifying,'' she whispered after the roar of the jet
faded into the distance. ``I disagree with this action very much.
It makes me feel we didn't learn anything from our past in
Europe.''

PATIENCE NEEDED ON KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the world's TV screens filled with the most grotesque
scenes of refugee catastrophe since the Nazi reign, where is the
cause for hope?
</P>
<P>
   Things look dreadful, to be sure. But the civilized world is
rallying to the cause of the 400,000 stranded Albanians. And public
opinion, initially shocked at the ferocity of the NATO bombing
campaign, is now polarizing against the Serbs for the viciousness
of their leader, Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   --What is the best outcome we can hope for? A quick end to the
NATO bombing, which in turn would require a stand-down by
Milosevic's rampaging forces. The clearing skies over Kosovo have
enabled NATO to rachet up the frequency, potency, and accuracy of
the air onslaught. NATO leaders vow they won't be outfoxed by a
Milosevic ploy to demand a bombing halt once he's butchered or
evicted most of the Albanians from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   As bleak as the prospect appears today, NATO's aim of returning
the bulk of Kosovo refugees, now approaching 1 million, to the land
of their birth, is still the eventual goal.
</P>
<P>
   --How can that possibly be accomplished, given the ethnic
cleansing that has transpired? What seems likely, even inevitable,
is the partition of Kosovo, where the 2 million Albanians
outnumbered Serbs by 9-1. It is not hard to envisage a UN-directed,
NATO-enforced partition that would give the Serbs a northern
enclave of the current Kosovo, to be lumped into the Greater Serbia
the Serbs are always talking about.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of what is now Kosovo must somehow devolve into a new,
enlarged, and dependent-on-the-West Greater Albania. It is also not
hard to envision the enlarged Albania, the most backward quadrant
of Europe, becoming a client state of the wealthy nations, a sort
of 51st state of the US, requiring economic development to lift an
undeveloped backwater into the 21st century. It will need roads,
bridges, housing, industrial development, power stations, the whole
rig. But the new Albania would still comprise only about 4 million
people, depending upon what happens to the enclaves of Montenegro
and Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   --What happens with what used to be Yugoslavia? That probably
becomes Serbia; Belgrade remains the capital. Does Milosevic remain
the leader? That depends on a lot of things. Can the allies kill
him in an air raid? Is there a chance he'll be strung up by the
heels like Mussolini? Do his fellow Serbs turn on him? Can he be
brought to justice as a war criminal, a fate he richly deserves?
</P>
<P>
   All this is up in the air. What's also in the air is an
astonishing and punishing variety of NATO ordnance, which may turn
the tide and spare the 19-nation NATO alliance the unappetizing
option of introducing ground combat troops.
</P>
<P>
   --Is there any way Milosevic can work some sort of public
relations ju-jitsu and emerge from this as a nationalist hero
fighting to defend his tiny country, the size and population of
Ohio, against the combined might of NATO countries representing
over 700 million people? At first glance, you'd say no; but then
look at the long, and so-far uninterrupted runs, or similarly
bellicose dictators, like Saddam Hussein, Muammar Qaddafi, and
Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   However, the documentation of the Serbian war crimes, the sheer
scope of the atrocities, and the inevitable mass graves and
soccer-field-turned-into-boneyards that have characterized his
previous wars in the Balkans, suggest his image is permanently
blackened. ``He started four wars in the past eight years,'' said
US negotiator Richard Holbrooke Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   This Serb's hands are permanently bloodied, and the first-hand
accounts of hundreds of thousands of Albanian deportees cannot be
eclipsed by a PR campaign, a captive TV network, or a rock concert.
</P>
<P>
   --Will the Clinton administration stay the course? As the most
criticized and vilified president since Truman, Clinton's enemies
are everywhere, but as ineffectual as ever. There is the ``the war
is over, we lost, Milosevic won,'' claque. The declarations of
surrender should at least wait until the outcome of the bombing
campaign, you'd think, but making sweeping declarations equivalent
to the-sky-is-falling gets a talking head off the sofa and onto the
tube.
</P>
<P>
   There is the ``we should have thought of all this before we
started'' school of diplomatic hindsight. Plainly, NATO's planners
did not envisage Milosevic acting with such Hitleresque
indifference to the niceties of civilized norms. But if you
criticize NATO for not doing enough last month, you can't criticize
NATO for not trying hard enough this month.
</P>
<P>
   --Who has this helped in America's domestic politics? Clinton,
for one; no one's talking about Monica now, and all the
flannelmouths who were braying two weeks ago about his ``legacy''
are finding new reasons to doubt his judgment, fortitude, or
diplomatic skills. The air war has also elevated Republican Senator
John McCain from the back of the pack toward the front. The
ineffectual ducking of GOP frontrunners George W. Bush and
Elizabeth Dole contrasts with the clear, sharp, hard position of
McCain, which is: bomb harder, send troops, go for the Serb
despot's throat.
</P>
<P>
   If presidential politics is unpredictable, so is the course of a
two-week-old war, and diplomatic attempts to corral the latest
Hitler stalking Europe. So be patient, don't panic, and remember
that we are on the right side, doing the right thing.

BASEBALL'S BACK? ROGER! 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ In sayings and stats, rules and maxims, lore
and legend, baseball leads the league in Talmudic scholarship. No
sage is savvier than Leonard Koppett, the former New York Times
scribe who now writes for the Oakland Tribune.
</P>
<P>
   Koppett stresses defense, declaring that bad fielding loses more
baseball games than good hitting. The logic is mathematically
inescapable: In many games, one run can ensure victory, but in
nearly every game, winning requires making 27 outs.
</P>
<P>
   In the home opener for the Oakland Athletics, after Derek Jeter
singled for the New York Yankees, Paul O'Neill hit a ground ball to
the second baseman, Tony Phillips, who booted what would have been
a double play. Jeter later scored and the Yankees led, 1-0, after
the first half-inning.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Athletics led the league with 141 errors and
surrendered 100 unearned runs. Porous leather may explain why they
won 74 games while the Yankees won 114. If
</P>
<P>
   Tony Phillips is the answer, what is the question? Oft-troubled
and much traveled, he has been a toothless Tiger, an anxious Angel,
and a mediocre Met. Phillips is one of the 40ish veterans Oakland
hopes will inspire its 20ish rookies. Oakland's generation gap is
based on its bargain-basement payroll, $25 million against the $88
million paid by the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillips error chilled many among the 46,380 at Oakland
Coliseum because pitching for the Yankees was Roger Clemens, he of
the five Cy Young awards, two won during what one former employer
called ``the twilight of his career.'' For Clemens, the weather was
a letter from home, as cold and rainy as any season opener in
Boston or Toronto. The storm clouds over the California coast were
as nasty as a Clemens split-fingered fastball.
</P>
<P>
   A one-run lead? That is often all the Rocket needs. But in the
first inning, he walked two batters and threw 19 pitches, hardly a
complete-game pace. He settled down, as they say in baseball, and
even after a 47-minute rain delay, Clemens easily struck out
batters, eight in all.
</P>
<P>
   But in baseball, as the Yankee interim manager, Don Zimmer,
said, ``Everyone's even on the first Monday.'' Oakland's Opening
Day ceremonies honored the heroes of its 1989 championship, a
parade that included Dave Stewart, the longtime Clemens nemesis,
and Dennis Eckersley, now a rookie broadcaster. The Eck and Zimmer
shook hands at home plate, sharing memories, if they had any, of
1978, when both wore Red Sox uniforms soiled and sullied by a
Yankee juggernaut.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Phillips was on that Oakland championship team, too. In the
fifth inning, he faced Clemens, who had inexplicably walked the
ninth batter. Phillips homered, tying the game at 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball can offer more acts of redemption in one night than a
three-day hoedown of the Christian Coalition. In the seventh, after
Clemens walked Phillips, Zimmer yanked the starting pitcher.
Oakland then erupted, eventually winning, 5-3. After another rain
delay and eight innings, the umpires ended the game at 12:27 a.m.
Oakland needed only 24 outs.
</P>
<P>
   Fairness in baseball today focuses on the disparity in payrolls,
willingly paid by owners and accepted by players. Gene Orza,
counsel for the players association, sniffs pro-owner propaganda in
these concerns, pointing out that rich teams beat poor teams
decades ago when players were chattel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big countries beat up small countries, too,'' Orza says.
``Revenue sharing is inadequate only to the extent that it dries up
the well of suitors. But there's always some guy in Charlotte or
Las Vegas who wants to buy a team under current conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   Orza would love a Minnesota-Montreal World Series to confound
the critics. Maybe Roger's washed up. Maybe the Yankees will
stumble. Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   Among many sporting maxims is one from the Manhattan writer,
Damon Runyon, who amended St. Paul: ``The race is not always to the
swift, nor the battle to the strong. But that's the way to bet.''

MOVING TOO FAST ON GEORGES BANK? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK JACKSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What scorched earth was to Sherman, scarred earth is to
scallopers. The Union general, leaving nothing to chance after
taking Atlanta, left only the charred embers of Confederate
factories, mills, and food stores in his march to the sea.
</P>
<P>
   Scallopers, leaving no profit untouched, leave a lifeless rubble
on the sea floor.
</P>
<P>
   Such a comparison, as brutal as it may seem to scallop
fishermen, should weigh heavily on the minds of the New England
Fishery Management Council. Next week the council is scheduled to
vote on whether to reopen Area 2 of Georges Bank that was closed in
1994 because of overfishing.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, Area 2 was closed because of the crash of ground
fish, such as cod and flounder. Scallopers were included in the ban
because their metal dredges also catch flounder and other fish in
fearsome amounts. The dredges catch 2 pounds of fish for every
pound of scallops, part of the worldwide crisis of ``bycatch,'' in
which boats pursuing a particular fish decimate other species.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent months, scientists have discovered that scallops
have recovered dramatically in Area 2 in colonies so plump and
populous they are at the point of overcrowding. Almost immediately,
scallopers called for a lifting of restrictions. After watching
their catch drop from 20 million pounds a year to under 9 million
pounds in less than a decade, their cries of economic hardship have
resulted in Capitol Hill clout.
</P>
<P>
   This winter, US Commerce Secretary William Daley, escorted by
Senator Ted Kennedy, came to New England to meet with scallopers.
The council had already been considering a limited reopening of
Georges Bank. But Daley wrote a letter to the council urging it to
consider a reopening by June 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sympathetic to their plight and want these areas open to
scallopers as soon as possible,'' Daley wrote the council.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said: ``This is welcome news for hundreds of fishing
families. Their economic survival depends on access to these closed
areas. I commend Secretary Daley for making a decision that
recognizes the legitimate and urgent needs of these hard-working
fishermen.''
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, Daley is committed to an expedited examination
of other currently closed areas to see if scallops can be fished
``at the earliest practicable date.''
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, none of these decisions appears to factor in any
full-scale pursuit of scientific evidence that would aid the
long-term survival of fish in these waters. Scallops may have
recovered quickly, but no one is even close to knowing whether they
symbolize a healed ecosystem or have merely become the crows and
starlings that quickly crowd out more delicate migratory birds as
humans cut down trees for cities and suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   We know that scallops can recover, but we know little about what
happens to the sponges, starfish, anemones, worms, and other
members of what is technically known as the benthic (occurring at
the bottom of the water) community. They have no value on your
dinner plate, but layer by layer, they end up as the food for cod
and flounder. Each run of a scallop dredge temporarily annihilates
that community. There is evidence they can begin to recover in a
couple of years or so, but no one knows how much battering _ in the
age of modern fishing _ such communities can take.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that scallopers should never be allowed to
fish again. But the fishing industry has proven itself to be an
almost complete failure at self-control. Daley is right to call for
expedited research, but not merely to confirm that $100 million of
scallops are ready to be picked.
</P>
<P>
   Any serious research should show whether enough of the ecosystem
has recovered so that any resumption of scalloping, with its
inescapable history of bycatch and a destruction of the sea floor
that includes flattening the terrain, will not endanger any of the
other ground fish.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists have raised concern that it is impossible to
know any of these answers by June 15. ``Washington politics is a
poor substitute for hands-on science,'' said Robert Russell and
Jennifer Atkinson of the Conservation Law Foundation. Doug Hopkins
of the Environmental Defense Fund, who is a member of the New
England Fishery Management Council, said, ``The fact that the
secretary of commerce has expressed such a direct interest in this
decision is putting a great deal of pressure on the council to come
to the conclusion he wants.''
</P>
<P>
   Daley is putting so much pressure on the council that
environmentalists fear that opening Area 2 is only the beginning of
a renewed scarred-earth campaign. As much as scallopers are
struggling financially, letting them plunder the sea without
sufficient science to know whether their fishing is safe or
foolish. They might get scallops to feed us for a day. Their march
under the sea might leave the underwater equivalent of charred
embers. Instead of glowing orange, these embers will be a dull,
barren gray that will haunt us for a lifetime.

FEDERAL JUDGES AREN'T ALL SMILING FOR THE CAMERA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILLIAM F. DOHERTY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- US District Judge Patti B. Saris remembers the trial _
and the experiment _ well. In 1994, an Indonesian general studying
at Harvard was sued by the family of a mourner who was massacred,
along with 270 others, by soldiers at a funeral.
</P>
<P>
   The trial attracted international attention and, for the first
time, television crews. They were allowed into the federal
courtroom under a pilot program that Saris thinks worked well. But
shortly after the trial ended, so did the experiment.
</P>
<P>
   Even today, when Judge Judy has toppled Oprah from her perch as
queen of daytime TV, when the global village tunes in to the trials
of Louise Woodward and O. J. Simpson, the federal courts remain
resolutely unplugged.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike their state counterparts, where cameras have been welcome
for at least two decades, the federal courts have resisted,
preferring the gentility of sketch artists to the intrusion of
videocams and tripods. But now, a proposal in Congress would allow
cameras in federal courtrooms if the sitting judge approves it,
overruling a blanket ban in effect for years.
</P>
<P>
   Judges in federal court in Boston have differing views, with
some welcoming the change as long-overdue and others fiercely
protecting their last bastion of low-tech justice.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents decry the snap judgments that flow from sound bites
and instant analysis, while proponents say it's about time the
federal courts joined the technological age.
</P>
<P>
   ``Television does a bad job with court proceedings, which lose
something when they are overly compressed,'' said US District Judge
Michael A. Ponsor, who sits in Springfield and doesn't want cameras
in his courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Television also subjects the parties, the judge, the lawyers,
and the witnesses to pressure which they really don't need,''
Ponsor added. ``It takes tremendous courage to take the stand and
describe things, like the death of a child, or losing a father
because of a botched operation, without having to worry about the
television camera focusing on their face to catch a tear forming in
the corner of an eye.''
</P>
<P>
   But US District Judge Nancy Gertner, who is familiar with
televised trials from her years as a high-profile defense lawyer,
said that after two decades of broadcast state court trials, ``the
genie is out of the bottle.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The public is used to it,'' said Gertner. ``It is a medium to
be dealt with, not to be ignored. For years state courts have been
televising the worst gut-wrenching street crimes and the republic
still survives. I just hope we have television while there is some
collagen left in my face.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate has been triggered by ``The Sunshine in the Courtroom
Act'' filed recently in Washington by two senators and two
representatives, including Representative William D. Delahunt of
Massachusetts. The legislation would give federal judges the power
to admit cameras to their courtrooms, which is now banned by the
Judicial Conference, the governing body of the federal courts.
</P>
<P>
   Delahunt said cameras in federal courts would offer the public
``an unfiltered, unvarnished glimpse of the judicial process. The
goal is enhanced confidence in our criminal-justice system.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which Delahunt filed along with Senators Charles
Schumer (D-New York) and Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) and
Representative Steve Chabot (R-Ohio), would allow cameras in both
appellate and trial courts.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-seven states, including Massachusetts, allow televised
coverage of state court proceedings, but federal courts, except for
the three-year experiment in the early 1990s, have never allowed
video cameras and have banned still photographs for half a century.
</P>
<P>
   Boston was one of six federal district courts that participated
in the pilot program, during which 14 civil cases were televised
here. But in the end, the Judicial Conference reimposed the ban,
citing a potential negative impact of cameras on jurors and
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, New York ousted TV cameras from its state courts, where
they had been allowed for a decade. Members of the defense bar
successfully argued that only sensational cases were broadcast,
there was little educational value, and criminal trials were
emphasized.
</P>
<P>
   Fordham Law School Dean John D. Feerick, who headed a commission
that studied camera coverage in New York courtrooms, disagreed with
the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Television provides confidence in the process,'' he said. ``It
gives people information on how the rule of law is working in court
trials.''
</P>
<P>
   Delahunt acknowledged there are cases in which cameras are not
appropriate. When he was Norfolk district attorney, Delahunt
supported a ban on TV cameras at the trial of John Salvi, the
abortion clinic gunman who had a propensity to act out before the
cameras.
</P>
<P>
   With his colleagues on the federal bench here split on the
issue, Chief US District Court Judge William G. Young sides with
the opponents _ a shift in position for him.
</P>
<P>
   Cameras in the courtroom, he argues, denigrate jurors' work when
viewers, who heard only snippets of testimony, second-guess the
verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Young didn't always feel that way. While a state Superior Court
judge in 1984, he presided over the ``Big Dan's'' gang-rape trial
in New Bedford, the first widely watched televised trial in
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time, I thought it was a good idea, that it served an
educational purpose,'' Young said. ``I bought the argument that
television can bring the courthouse to the people.''
</P>
<P>
   But now, after the Simpson and Woodward trials, Young believes
the viewing public wrongly thinks it knows as much about the
evidence as the jury. As a result, viewers feel qualified to
disregard the jury verdict, Young says.
</P>
<P>
   Witness the protests in the streets outside the Cambridge
courthouse after a jury convicted Woodward of second-degree murder,
a verdict later reduced by the judge to involuntary manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``A trial is not rocket science and we think that after watching
five minutes, we can go on `Oprah' and think we know what it is all
about,'' said Young. ``Everyone in the world would be
second-guessing (jurors) and they may not be willing to serve.''
</P>
<P>
   Young does not object to televising non-jury cases, noting that
the new federal courthouse on Fan Pier, which was built to
accommodate hidden security cameras, could easily _ and
unobtrusively _ handle TV cameras.
</P>
<P>
   For attorney Frederic N. Halstrom, former president of the
Massachusetts Academy of Trial Lawyers, it's all about democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public is entitled to see what is going on in their
courts,'' said Halstrom. ``They can't be there in person because
they are working to pay taxes, taxes which pay the salaries of the
judges and court personnel.''

WELCOME TO THE REPUBLIC OF ME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a few days, I will be sending a pot of money off to the
Internal Revenue Service. I can imagine better uses for my swag
than bombing the bejesus out of a country whose hospitality I
enjoyed many years ago. But transferring a portion of my pitiful
income to the treasury coffers isn't such an onerous task, ever
since Bill Clinton transformed the United States of America into
the Republic of Me.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard not to notice that the entire country is being run for
my benefit. Not for my personal benefit, perhaps, but certainly for
the benefit of my generation. It's great being a member of the
still-active (Alex Beam) _ as opposed to the incipiently decrepit
(Al Gore) _ Baby Boom generation. We've got the numbers,
demographically and economically. We vote, we buy tons of stuff, we
whine, volubly. No need of ours goes unmet.
</P>
<P>
   We have children; Bill Clinton gives us a new Child Tax Credit.
Our kids are approaching college age; Bill Clinton awards us the
fifteen-hundred-dollar college credits. How are we paying for that
new Accord in the driveway? (Not in my driveway, alas . . .) By
selling stock, at the new lower capital gains rate.
</P>
<P>
   Now our ally and contemporary Mr. Clinton proposes pouring
billions of surplus budgetary dollars into the Social Security
system. The purpose is not to benefit today's oldsters _
fuhggedaboudem! _ but to benefit . . . me. ``Once self-indulgent
Baby Boomers have been enrolled in the AARP,'' predicts the Wall
Street Journal, ``the rest of the government may go begging.'' You
know how the HMOs are forcing the elderly to pay for prescription
drugs? How much do you want to bet those rules get changed by the
time I start quaffing Prilosec?
</P>
<P>
   This is great. This is living. Imagine what it would be like to
be on the wrong end of Mr. Clinton's list of priorities. Like on
welfare. Just a couple of years ago, Clinton confiscated $1,300
worth of annual food-stamp benefits from 11 million families living
at or near the poverty line. That was when he also tossed legal
immigrants out of the Supplemental Security Income program (he let
them back in two years later). Better that than tamper with my
mortgage deduction, I say. Alas, some people aren't full-fledged
citizens of this delightful Republic of Me.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the horror and blind ineptitude of Mr. Bill's Balkan
adventure, this little war is a classic Republic of Me production.
My generation's too old to fight; our children are too young. The
whole affair is blissfully far away, and even the newspaper-reading
public seems to be swallowing the ``humanitarian angle'' churned
out by Bill Clinton's Ministry of Propaganda. Milosevic as Hitler?
Why not? Heck, we believed the Rose Law firm files mysteriously
``reappeared'' in the White House library, didn't we?
</P>
<P>
   But why worry about the war? The minute I tire of it _ and that
will be the minute Albanian refugees show up on the Green Line _
Clinton will declare victory and go home. Let's enjoy the other
Republic of Me benefits all around us. Aren't those oldies stations
great? Who cares if nobody else likes our music _ we'll force them
to listen! Did you see that Bob Dylan and Paul Simon are touring
together this summer? Shag-adelic, baby!
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood panders to our teenage children (spending our money,
natch), but it still knows how to lure the HBO generation into the
cineplex: Re-release some vintage Boomer chaff (``Big Chill,''
``Star Wars'') is one way to go. Or better yet, churn out movies
suggesting that geriatric Boomer idols like Clint Eastwood (69) or
Robert Redford (62) remain alluring to women half their age. Who
says movies aren't realistic?
</P>
<P>
   The great thing about the Republic of Me is that it will last
forever. Because the Boomers think they're immortal, or the closest
thing to it. Some Harvard quack is pushing a book called ``Living
to 100,'' which I plan to ridicule under separate cover. Tough
news, kids. We'll give you your country back in 2050; another
half-century of Mary Tyler Moore reruns to go!

<P>
   In May 1988, the Rev. Walter H. Everett was furious as he
listened to a Connecticut prosecutor explain why the man accused of
killing Everett's son was about to agree to a plea bargain that
would result in a five-year jail sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Six years later, Everett performed the marriage ceremony for his
son's convicted killer.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Everett, 64, and Michael Carlucci, 39, the man who put a
gun to Scott Everett's head inside a Bridgeport, Conn., apartment
and pulled the trigger, are close friends who talk on the phone
regularly.
</P>
<P>
   What happened between Everett, pastor of the United Methodist
Church of Hartford, and Carlucci, who works for a trucking company
in Connecticut, is a powerful story of forgiveness, faith, and
healing.
</P>
<P>
   The men travel to colleges and churches, describing their
journey together, hoping to provide a stark lesson on the
possiblities of redemption and reconciliation even in the worst of
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Everett said he chose to forgive Carlucci because he could not
bear the alternative _ to live with the anger seething in him ever
since he learned his son had been murdered.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed to me that the primary right of a victim's family is
not to have the rest of their lives consumed with anger,''
explained Everett. ``My son's life was taken. I don't want my life
to be taken by my anger.''
</P>
<P>
   Forgiveness, Everett makes clear, does not mean in any way
condoning what Carlucci did. It means, he said, ``feeling good
enough about yourself to want the process of healing to begin.''
</P>
<P>
   Everett's ordeal began July 26, 1987, as he sat in a restaurant
in Virginia. He and other church volunteers were on their way to
North Carolina to build homes for a Habitat for Humanity project.
</P>
<P>
   On that morning, a waitress called out Everett's name. She told
him he had a phone call. It was from the pastor of the church where
Everett had spent the night. Everett had to call home urgently. It
was an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   One of his sons answered and broke the news. Everett flew back
home that same day to plan his son's funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Carlucci, meanwhile, was quickly arrested. He declines to go
into the details of how he and Scott ended up in an altercation in
the building where Scott lived. But after he shot Scott, Carlucci
called the police and said: ``I shot someone in the head.''
</P>
<P>
   At his sentencing, Carlucci expressed remorse for the killing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry for what I did,'' he told the court. ``I'm sorry I
killed Scott. I wish I could bring him back, but words can't do
that. I know these sound like empty words, but I don't know what
else to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlucci's words stirred something in Everett. He prayed for
some guidance. Eventually, he decided to write Carlucci. In his
letter, Everett described his fury, bewilderment, and frustration
over Carlucci's deed.
</P>
<P>
   But then he wrote: ``Having said all that I want to thank you
for what you said in court and despite how hard it is to write
these words, I forgive you.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlucci said he was stunned. When he first saw the return
address on the envelope, he was angry, believing Everett was
writing to harass him. He never expected to be forgiven.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one had ever forgiven me for anything my whole life,'' said
Carlucci, whose life up until Scott Everett's killing had been
consumed with alcohol and drugs. He says he had been arrested more
than 40 times.
</P>
<P>
   ``My life was so bad I didn't care what happened to me and I
certainly didn't care what happened to anyone else,'' said
Carlucci.
</P>
<P>
   But that began to change when he was in prison for Everett's
murder. Carlucci asked Everett to visit him. After putting it off
for a while because he was not sure he could handle it, Everett did
come see Carlucci. Their meeting ended in a hug.
</P>
<P>
   ``He showed me what unconditional love is,'' Carlucci said.
Carlucci started attending Narcotics Anonymous meetings. Everett
ended up testifying on Carlucci's behalf at his parole hearing.
Carlucci left prison after serving nearly three years.
</P>
<P>
   Today, he is married, owns a home, and is holding down a steady
job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people are worth giving a shot to change,'' Carlucci
said. ``Whether they can change, it's up to them.'' He says
speaking in public helps him remember where he came from and ``to
have gratitude for what I've been through and what I have.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Everett said, ``This isn't the guy who killed my
son. This is someone who has been changed by God.''

HIGH-TECH ALLURE DRAWS ISRAELI FIRMS TO BOSTON

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- There are many reasons why Greater Boston is a world
center for high technology. MIT. Harvard. Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Israel. Dozens of local tech firms have an Israeli
connection. Some serve as beachheads for Israeli companies moving
into the US market, while others are US-based companies founded on
Israeli technical know-how. But all of these firms are benefiting
from a combination of factors that have made the Boston area
especially attractive to Israeli technology firms. And the influx
of Israeli companies further bolsters the region's reputation for
technology leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came here two years ago, there were about 30 Israeli
companies,'' said Michel Habib, Israel's economic consul in Boston.
Today, he puts the number at 65 ``that we know about,'' with
perhaps a dozen more operating below Habib's radar. The technology
mecca of Silicon Valley boasts 90 or more Israeli tech firms, but
Habib says Boston is catching up.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because of a powerful combination of time, money, and
brains. Obviously, the region's large population of technically
trained workers is a big advantage. ``This area is very high-tech
intensive,'' said Rami Hascal, planning and control manager for
Orbotech Ltd. of Billerica, maker of optical inspection machines
for printed circuit boards. ``There are a lot of technological
resources and knowledge in the area we can take advantage of.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Israel already produces a lot of extremely good
scientists and engineers. Its huge scientific university Technion
is as good as any in the world. According to the Israeli Economic
Mission, Israel boasts 135 engineers for every 100,000 citizens _
the highest proportion in the world. And every able-bodied man and
woman in the country must serve in the military, where many of them
receive exhaustive technical training.
</P>
<P>
   But Israel is not as well-stocked with trained business managers
who can turn a start-up firm into a star. ``We recognize they do
world-class engineering, but the marketing and sales of the product
leave something to be desired,'' says Joel Berkowitz, regional
director of the American Technion Society.
</P>
<P>
   Hillel Bachrach saw the problem back in 1974, three years after
he had graduated from Technion. ``At that time in Israel,''
Bachrach says, ``business schools were entirely unknown.'' Most
business managers were burnt-out engineers, not highly motivated
specialists. So Bachrach moved to the United States and earned an
MBA from Northwestern University. He went on to work for the
medical products division of General Electric Co., and today is
senior vice president of ESC Medical Systems Ltd. in Needham, a
maker of laser devices for use in cosmetic surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ESC needs personnel who understand not only the products, but
also how to sell them. And such people aren't easy to find. ``The
industry of medical lasers has been my life for the last 11
years,'' Bachrach said, ``but compared to the rest of business,
it's not very big.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the Boston area is home to several medical laser firms,
including Candela Corp. in Wayland, Summit Technology Inc. in
Waltham, and Cynosure Inc. in Chelmsford. Bachrach said this
concentration of talent helps keep his company staffed, sometimes
by hiring away workers from rival firms.
</P>
<P>
   Money is another of Boston's attractions for Israeli companies.
Local venture capital firms, eager to participate in the technology
boom, are ready to back sharp Israeli business people with bright
ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The country outside of the United States that is by far the
most active for early stage technology deals . . . is Israel,''
says Stephen R. Kahn, managing director of Boston's Advent
International. Advent has formed an alliance with Gemini Capital
Fund Management Ltd. of Herzlia, Israel, to invest in promising
Israeli firms. Advent and Gemini have invested in 17 Israeli firms
with operations in the United States; four of these are in the
Boston area.
</P>
<P>
   Investors such as Advent are attracted not only by the technical
skill of the Israelis, but also by their habits of teamwork and
discipline. Gemini president Ed Mlavsky gives the credit to
Israel's small population and its tradition of mandatory military
service. ``Many of these people get to know and trust each other
very well because they work together, and it's a small country,''
Mlavsky said.
</P>
<P>
   Too small, in fact. With a population of fewer than six million,
Israel is simply not a big enough market for the technology it
produces. Shimon Alon, president of Precise Software Solutions Inc.
in Braintree, calls Israel ``the greatest island I've ever known in
my life. It's surrounded either by sea, or by people who don't buy
from you.''
</P>
<P>
   That is why Israeli firms are aggressively moving into foreign
markets, with the United States at the top of the list. Alon, who
also serves as president of the New England-Israel Chamber of
Commerce, says there is no point trying to sell in the United
States without having a presence here. ``The success of a company
is its ability to serve its customers,'' he said. ``The majority of
the customers are here in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   While Silicon Valley is America's best-known technology center,
Greater Boston is its most convenient, from an Israeli point of
view. It is a matter of time _ the seven-hour time difference
between Israel and Boston, compared to 10 hours between Israel and
San Jose. It makes for an easier commute by air. More important, it
allows Israeli and American operations to communicate easily by
phone, fax, and e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really impossible to have a daily interaction from office
to office when you have a West Coast operation,'' said Israel's
economic consul Habib. A 10 a.m. phone call from Silicon Valley
arrives at 8 p.m. in Israel, well after closing time. But 10 a.m.
in Boston is 5 p.m. in Israel, so the two offices can share
important information without having to wait until the next
business day.
</P>
<P>
   When Indigo N.V., an Israeli maker of digital printing
equipment, decided to come to the United States in 1994, it opened
its first sales and support office in Woburn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, being a high-tech company, we wanted to be in a
high-tech area, where we could attract the right people to be with
us,'' said Roger Mattalon, Indigo's president of worldwide sales
and marketing.
</P>
<P>
   One ironic attraction of the area is the presence in Bedford of
the US headquarters of another Israeli firm _ Scitex Corp., a world
leader in printing and scanning technology that has been in the US
since the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Indigo has about 160 American employees. Many of them are
engineers who work with the company's printing clients to learn
about the ways customers use the firm's products. The information
they gain helps Indigo design its next generation of digital
presses.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston area's reputation as a haven for Israeli tech firms
is attracting still more of them. The New England-Israel Chamber of
Commerce, in cooperation with Massport, operates Market Gateway, a
technology incubation project to help Israeli companies put down
roots in Boston. A number of local firms, including Cambridge-based
Elron Software Inc. and RadView Software Inc. of Lexington, have
graduated from the program, with more firms in the pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   Michel Habib predicts a boom in biotechnology companies in
Israel during the next decade. He figures that these companies will
naturally gravitate to the Boston area, already a center of biotech
research. So the influx of Israeli firms may still have a way to
go.
</P>
<P>
   Said Habib, ``I believe were are in the beginning of it.''

WARNING TRIPS GILLETTE SHARES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This wasn't the send-off Al Zeien had in mind.
</P>
<P>
   Eight days before Zeien's final appearance as chief executive
presiding over Gillette Co.'s annual meeting, Wall Street gave the
company's stock a beating Tuesday the like of which it hadn't seen
since the 1987 stock market crash.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette shares plunged 7 3/4 to 50, responding to a company
warning about reduced expectations for the first half of 1999 that
had been issued the prior evening. Trading of Gillette stock was
briefly delayed in the morning because a crush of sellers had
created an order imbalance.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate problem: Weak sales in Latin Ameria, particularly
Brazil, and disappointing performance in the company's Braun
division will probably cut first-quarter earnings a penny per share
below expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The more serious problem: diminished faith that Gillette can
pull off much more important advances in the second half of the
year, when business is expected to increase by 15 percent or more
over year-ago levels by the company's own public estimates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are no longer confident the company can generate quality
earnings per share growth of 15 to 20 percent'' in the second half
of the year, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter analyst Catherine Lewis
wrote Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Recommendations for Gillette stock were reduced by at least
three brokerage analysts before trading began Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette stock has been trading at prices that suggest explosive
growth in the near future, about 64 percent higher than the average
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 stock when measured in relation to future
earnings forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the company's actual business has been
dragging along at a pace that would be generously described as
pokey. It will generate first-quarter sales growth in the ``low
single digits.''
</P>
<P>
   The short analysis of Tuesday's stock activity: Reality got the
better of expectations. The market may have overreacted to some
degree Tuesday, but you couldn't miss the chill of doubt that set
in after Gillette's second performance warning in the last three
quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Since January, Zeien himself has been talking up the return of
historical sales growth rates of 15 to 20 percent for the second
half of the year. He touted a ``tidal wave'' of new products that
would boost business but didn't emphasize that battered results
from the second half of 1998 will make for easier comparisons.
</P>
<P>
   Zeien, the manager rightfully credited with building Gillette's
global marketing machine, will retire April 15 at the company's
annual meeting in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette was sticking with its second-half comeback story
Tuesday. Company officials suggested several points of strength,
among them:
</P>
<P>
   --General international improvements. Gillette points to its own
business trends in Asia Pacific as evidence of better news ahead.
In the third quarter of 1998, sales were down 29 percent and gross
profit was off 52 percent compared to the same quarter a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   By the fourth quarter, year-ago sales were off 11 percent and
gross profits were down 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
   --The growing impact of Gillette's Mach3 razor, now clearly seen
as a successful new product. Substantial start-up and production
costs for the Mach3 are coming down this year. Sales of high-margin
blades will also have an increasing impact through 1998. Mach3
blades took a 15.8 percent market share in February and Gillette's
overall piece of the market increased by more than 3 percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
   --Expansion of product line and geographic distribution of a new
Ultra line of batteries made by its Duracell unit, which has been a
weak performer recently.
</P>
<P>
   But even analysts who don't take issue with Zeien's growth
forecast doubt it is a good reason to value Gillette stock
substantially higher than that of other companies. Is jumping over
a low bar so impressive, and what do you do the next time around?
</P>
<P>
   ``The second-half numbers last year were so hobbled by
international problems and start-up costs for the Mach3,'' said
Robert Izmirlian of Standard &AMP; Poor's Corp. ``Once you get beyond
that, you have to wonder if it's sustainable.''
</P>
<P>
   Gillette isn't the only global consumer product company with
problems. Coca-Cola Co., for one, has also warned about slower
sales and profits.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult for these giant companies to make any handsome
gains in a balky global economy. The question is whether they
should remain darlings of the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
The Red Herring
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Back on the shelf: Numeric Investors will reopen two funds that
were managed by John Bogle Jr. until he resigned from the
Cambridge, Mass. firm in February. Numeric's $96 million Micro Cap
fund and its $62 million Growth fund will reopen to existing
shareholders on April 19 and to everyone on May 17.
</P>
<P>
   The funds have been closed since 1997, when they reached $100
million in assets. Numeric cited an increased stock market
liquidity and ``moderate'' redemptions connected to Bogle's
departure as reasons to reopen the funds.

YOUNG STUDENTS TAUGHT TO TRADE FEELINGS, NOT INSULTS

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Abby Alexanian, 10, is trying hard to make the boys in her
fourth-grade class understand. ``We don't all worry about what we
look like,'' she says with a determined frown. Abby looks down at
her dusty brown overalls and then at the scruffily dressed girls
seated beside her.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not girlie,'' she adds. ``We like bugs and stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   As Abby eagerly demolishes a few of the stereotypes raised by
the boys in her class, it is clear she doesn't think she is asking
too much. But what she and other children in Linda Bowden's class
at Glen Urquhart School in Beverly, Mass. are doing is akin to
tearing down the Great Wall of China.
</P>
<P>
   Under the careful guidance of two behavioral scientists, they
are trying to bridge a cultural gender gap that becomes dangerously
wide by adolescence, giving rise to what many see as a growing
problem of sexual harassment and assault in schools.
</P>
<P>
   The effort comes none too soon. Research confirms that boys and
girls begin to go their separate ways as early as kindergarten or
first grade. Before that age little children often play together
oblivious to gender, but beginning at age 5 or 6, cultural
expectations force boys and girls apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``This enforced separation reaches a crescendo in fourth grade,
where you see very little interaction between boys and girls. By
the time they get back together again in sixth grade, they are
mysteries to each other,'' says Dr. Stephen J. Bergman, a
psychiatrist affiliated with Harvard Medical School. ``That's why
we keep going into lower and lower grades. If we can start at the
beginning, perhaps we can make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Toward that end, Bergman and psychologist Janet L. Surrey have
sold a few area schools on a program that teaches boys and girls in
grades 1 to 4 to connect with each other in a new way.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is that if boys and girls can learn to be friends in
grade school, they may stop harassing each other as adolescents.
And they may even think twice about having sex too soon, says
Surrey, a clinical psychologist with the Stone Center at Wellesley
College.
</P>
<P>
   Bergman and Surrey's program, which they introduced at Glen
Urquhart last month, is built on a series of questions that boys
and girls ask of each other, first in same-sex and then in
opposite-sex groups. It evolved out of thousands of dialogues that
Bergman and Surrey, who are married, had with other couples, work
that resulted in their book, ``We Have to Talk,'' newly out in
paperback.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adults get stuck in old patterns of behavior that interfere
with new ways of opening up,'' says Bergman, who, under the same
pseudonym, Samuel Shem, is also the author of the cult classic
``The House of God'' and its sequel, ``Mount Misery.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But the kids seem to get it right away,'' he adds. ``And
what's such a lift is that they really go for it. They really want
to know about each other.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's precisely what worries some parents and teachers.
</P>
<P>
   A few have voiced fears that all this togetherness might turn
boys into wimps and girls into tomboys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think these programs are harmful; they will confuse kids,''
says Marsha Ciccolo, a parent who did not allow her teenage
children to attend health courses at the local public school. ``You
can stand on your head and try to change the fundamental
differences between the sexes, but it won't happen. Men and women
are totally different and you can't try to change the healthy
evolutionary course of things.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time constraints are an even bigger stumbling block, teachers
say, especially now with the new standardized testing requirements.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult to get any kind of new curriculum in the
schools in Massachusetts, especially with this new testing mania,''
says Nan Stein, a senior researcher at Wellesley College who
created some of the first programs aimed at preventing sexual
harassment in schools.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers at Day Middle School in Newton, Mass., Stein says, who
helped her test her ``Flirting and Hurting'' curriculum in 1993,
``say they would never have time to pilot test any new curriculum
now. They're too busy teaching review courses, all for an imperfect
and arbitrary test.''
</P>
<P>
   Stein's ``Flirting and Hurting'' course is taught in some
Massachusetts middle and high schools. Elements of both Stein's
curriculum and Bergman and Surrey's dialogue are also folded into a
yearlong health course taught to seventh graders at Newton's Day
and Oak Hill middle schools. The only elementary schools
experimenting with similar curriculum are the three Boston-area
private schools working with Bergman and Surrey.
</P>
<P>
   Yet new research shows that the earlier children are exposed to
curriculum that teaches them how to resolve conflict and recognize
each other feelings, the more effective the results. A study in
last month's Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine found
that a curriculum targeted at children, parents, and teachers from
first grade through sixth was far more effective in reducing later
levels of violent behavior, heavy drinking, and sexual intercourse
among participants than the same program aimed at older grades.
Participants also achieved better academic performance in later
grades than did other students.
</P>
<P>
   Some educators see an immediate impact as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is just as important as academics,'' said Glen
Urquhart's Bowden. ``When boys and girls can talk to each other, it
makes the atmosphere of the classroom more cohesive and peaceful.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, Bowden says, her fourth-graders come in from recess
``all grumpy'' and disgruntled over a misunderstanding on the
playground. Recently, a few of the girls in her class tried to join
the boys in a pickup soccer game and some of the boys promptly
walked off the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``To just start the class and teach math doesn't serve the kids
very well; they can't concentrate,'' Bowden says. ``It really helps
to take a few minutes and discuss what happened on the soccer
field.''
</P>
<P>
   The dialogue Bergman and Surrey had just introduced to her class
that morning would be a perfect framework in which to do that,
Bowden adds. ``I wish this had happened earlier in the year; it
would have been a great way to start the class off,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At Glen Urquhart that morning, Bergman and Surrey had first
separated the 12 boys and 7 girls into same-sex groups and asked
them to write down things they most wanted to understand about the
opposite sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are they so, like, picky?'' asked Eric Sherman, 10,
referring to girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Picky about what?'' Bergman asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Picky about their hair, or what they eat; they're always on a
diet.''
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the girls kept circling around to the same
question, although they asked it in a number of different ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do boys taunt and make jokes about girls when they like
them?'' asked one girl.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are boys so rough?'' asked another.
</P>
<P>
   Why indeed. A growing body of research (and a host of new books
by psychologists from ``Rescuing Our Sons from the Myths of
Boyhood'' to ``Raising Cain'') suggests that boys are ``rough''
because they are forced to disconnect from emotions and
relationships at an early age. Boys aren't supposed to cry, and
instead of being encouraged, as girls are, to reach out to others,
boys are steered toward silence and stoicism.
</P>
<P>
   They learn quickly that if they show their feelings, they may
get pummeled on the playground. And the pressure to be cool and
above any need for connection is reinforced by sexually violent
movies, television shows, video games, and rap songs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boys understand this part of themselves has to go
underground,'' says Surrey, who helped pioneer the Stone Center
theory that being in relationships with others is crucial to human
development. ``And some boys lose that part of themselves along the
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Girls, on the other hand, learn to value restraint and worship
at the altar of popularity and good looks. That pressure, Surrey
says, can lead to eating disorders and the kind of subtle cruelties
and exclusionary games that preteen girls are famous for.
</P>
<P>
   Such cultural pressures, however, are still faint noise in first
and second grade, if the behavior of 16 6- and 7-year-olds at
Atrium School in Watertown, Mass. one recent morning is any
indication.
</P>
<P>
   The topic is ``connection'' _ what it means to feel connected to
others _ and Bergman and Surrey have spent weeks training the two
Atrium teachers on how to broach the subject, as the first
installment of their four-week program on gender.
</P>
<P>
   The children are already sitting in gender-separated clumps, and
as they begin to throw out examples of when they felt connected, it
is clear who their friends are: children of the same sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel connected to Tom because I can play soccer with him and
I love soccer,'' says one boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``One time I was feeling a little sad, I was missing my mom, and
Briana came over and hugged me; that made me feel better,'' says a
girl.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the gender divide, the children have no problem
expressing their feelings for each other.
</P>
<P>
   One boy named Jeremy says, ``I feel really connected to Max and
Evan. Right from our first play date, it was like the happiest
moment. . .'' He starts to cry and rubs his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, one of the teachers confides that up till now, Jeremy
has had problems expressing himself and reaching out to other
children. She sees what happened today as a kind of breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is such power in this,'' Bergman later concludes, his
voice tinged with wonder. ``Boys are just as eager as girls to
connect; they just haven't been allowed to do so.''

LEWIS MAKES PLAYS, NOT HIGHLIGHT REELS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ There came a point last December, when Dan
Duquette confidently waited for Bernie Williams's agent to call
back to say the Yankees' star had accepted Boston's $90
million-plus offer, that Darren Lewis appeared bound for anywhere
but back in center field for the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   But when the season opened Monday, Williams was still in
pinstripes, while Lewis remained the center fielder of record for
the Red Sox. He didn't have a good game in the 5-3 win over the
Royals, going hitless in five trips and experiencing a rare failure
in not moving Jose Offerman over from second base with none out in
the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   But, as he usually does, Lewis still found a way to contribute.
He made one of his patented sliding catches in short center to take
a hit away from Joe Randa in the third inning. And, as left fielder
Troy O'Leary tells it, his mere presence helped O'Leary make the
day's best defensive play, a sprinting catch of Jermaine Dye's bid
for extra bases, preventing the Royals from roughing up Pedro
Martinez any further in the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   No one would argue that the Sox are better off without Williams,
the defending American League batting champion who would have slid
nicely into Mo Vaughn's third spot in the order.
</P>
<P>
   But no one would dispute that Lewis, picked up on the cheap by
Duquette a year ago, has played a vital role in making the Red Sox
a much better team. And it goes beyond his defense, even though the
man did not make an error in center field last season and should
have been recognized with a Gold Glove.
</P>
<P>
   It's about preparation, dedication, and a knowledge of what it
takes to win. Most of all, it's about consistency. In short, he's
the type of player admired by teammates and managers _ including
his former Giants skipper, Dusty Baker, who over the winter named
his newborn son after Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a flashy-type player,'' Lewis said in a recent
conversation. ``You're not going to notice me if you watch me one
time. But watch me over the course of a season, and you'll see I do
the little things.''
</P>
<P>
   Those little things added up to a three-year, $7.1 million deal
for Lewis, who signed last fall before Duquette put on the
full-court press for Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis was aware of the Red Sox' interest in Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't faze me, to be honest with you,'' he said. ``I do
whatever is asked of me. I come ready to play. If they wanted me to
play right field, I'll play right field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been around a while now. I know there's nothing etched in
stone. When you start to believe that, you're setting yourself up
for trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Before coming to the Red Sox, Lewis had played for four teams in
three seasons and had lost his status as an everyday player, one
who batted leadoff and won a Gold Glove for the Giants in 1994.
He'd batted just .228 for the White Sox in 1996, and the following
season found himself playing behind a rookie, Mike Cameron.
</P>
<P>
   But after being installed as leadoff man by Jimy Williams last
May when Nomar Garciaparra was switched to cleanup, Lewis set
career highs in hits, average, runs, doubles, and RBIs. He hit .282
as leadoff man, .268 overall, and after tiring in August, when he
hit just .211, finished up by hitting .357 against the Indians in
the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Vindication?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you always want to prove people wrong,'' he said. ``As
a professional athlete, no matter how long you've been playing,
even if you're 39 years old, you're still trying to prove people
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you've stopped doing that, maybe you've lost your edge.
For me, it's been that way ever since I was young.''
</P>
<P>
   This season, with Jose Offerman aboard, Lewis will hit second.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not your prototypical leadoff hitter,'' he said. ``As a
No. 2 hitter, I can hit behind the runner, I can take pitches, I
can bunt, I can put the ball in play. I can hit all over the
lineup. To me, thart's a bonus that I offer.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, who holds the major league record for consecutive
errorless chances by a center fielder, wasn't surprised that he
didn't win a Gold Glove; the outfielders honored were Jim Edmonds
of the Angels, Ken Griffey of the Mariners, and Williams. All
splendid fielders, undeniably, with Edmonds and Griffey
highlight-reel regulars.
</P>
<P>
   But, for the record, Griffey and Edmonds made five errors
apiece. Williams made three. Lewis, errorless in 109 games in
center field, made all three of his errors in right field, a
position for which he really doesn't have the arm. Lewis will be
playing when the Red Sox face Royals lefthander Jose Rosado, with
Damon Buford, who played errorless ball in 68 games in the outfield
last season, playing center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not the type who's going to promote myself,'' Lewis said.
``It's not my style. It's not my priority. I'm going to show up and
leave everything I have on the field. As long as everybody in this
room respects what I do, that's where I get my gratification.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis used to dress next to Mo Vaughn in the clubhouse and came
to become a great admirer of the first baseman. He keenly feels the
loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``He meant a lot to us as a group,'' Lewis said. ``We all liked
him and respected him. We all understand that. But it's time for us
to figure out how we're going to compensate for that.''
</P>
<P>
   While Vaughn's leadership was invaluable, Lewis said, that
doesn't mean this team will fall apart without him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't fear it being a problem when we have so many guys here
who have been in the game for six-plus years,'' he said. ``This is
basically a veteran-oriented ball club.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had six or seven young players in the lineup, then I'd
be concerned. But most of the guys in this room know what to do.
They don't need anybody to get in their face.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a need for a whole lot of mentorship in this room.
I know if something needs to be said, somebody will say it. But on
this team, you're not going to have to say too much. Of all the
teams I've played on, this team is the most prepared and ready to
play that I've been around.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what Jimy Williams preaches. It's what Darren Lewis
lives.
</P>
<P>
   And that alone is a good enough reason to keep him around.

PLAYERS, LEAGUES ADDRESS KOSOVO SITUATION IN DIFFERENT WAYS

<P>
   If the choice is between capitalism and nationalism, Predrag
Mijatovic will place his country first. Mijatovic and five other
players of Serbian descent boycotted games in Spain last week, and
Mijatovic was fined 5 million pesetas ($32,400) by Real Madrid. If
he continues to sit out, Real Madrid has threatened to demote him
to the reserve team, which competes in the second division.
</P>
<P>
   Mijatovic, protesting the conflict in Kosovo, said, ``Players
are not going to play while our relatives can leave their houses.''
</P>
<P>
   The conflict has caused the postponement of three European
Championship 2000 games, and players in Italy wrote ``Stop Violence
_ Stop War'' on their shirts for Saturday's games. The 11
Yugoslavian players in Italy wore black armbands.
</P>
<P>
   But at least one Italian legislator agreed with the German
Bundesliga ban on signs of protest, saying that if players did not
perform for their inflated salaries they should return to their
homeland, where the economy might be as healthy.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   History lesson &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Though advancements toward big-time soccer in the US are
perceived as almost spontaneous, they in fact are part of an
evolution. In fact, the origins of club soccer in the US predate
those of most of the world's powers, including World Cup champions
Argentina, Brazil, France, and Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the professional game has prospered only sporadically in the
US, because of a variety of problems.
</P>
<P>
   Major League Soccer is the latest attempt to inculcate the game
in the professional sports culture of America. MLS is a successor
to the North American Soccer League, which folded in 1985, and both
were preceded by the subject of Colin Jose's book, ``American
Soccer League 1921-1931/The Golden Years of American Soccer''
(Scarecrow Press).
</P>
<P>
   While it lasted, the ASL ``grew into a league of international
renown, a league which sent shock waves around the soccer world,''
according to Jose, a historian for the Soccer Hall of Fame in
Oneonta, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Like the MLS and NASL, the league was well-financed, by
prominent industrialists such as Horace Edgar Lewis of Bethlehem
Steel Co. and William Madison Wood of American Woolen Co., plus
entrepreneurs such as Samuel Mark, who lent his money and name to
the Fall River Marksmen, baseball's Horace Stoneham, and A.G. Wood
of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Mark constructed the first US stadium specifically designed for
professional soccer, predating the Columbus Crew's by about 75
years. Mark's Stadium had a capacity of 15,500 and was located in
North Tiverton, R.I., to avoid Massachusetts Blue Law restrictions
on Sunday games.
</P>
<P>
   The ASL's power base was in New England, which was predictable
since the first soccer club in the Western Hemisphere, Oneida FC,
was founded in Boston in 1862.
</P>
<P>
   At the turn of the century, thousands of workers were moving to
the Eastern Seaboard, and many were top-class soccer players
seeking opportunities outside Britain's maximum-wage system. Player
movement was rare between countries, and Alec McNab shocked
observers when he left Greenock Morton's 1922 Scottish Cup-winning
team to join the Boston WonderWorkers. McNab tripled his earnings
to $25 a week and became the ASL's premier attraction, the Pele of
his time, according to Jose.
</P>
<P>
   Before 1925, the offsides rule required three opposition players
to be between the goal and the attacker receiving a pass, but this
hardly discouraged ASL offenses. Archie Stark set an all-time first
division world record with 67 goals for Bethlehem Steel in the
1924-25 season, the last before the offsides rule was changed.
</P>
<P>
   Though the 2,000 ASL players were mostly foreign-born, the
league's high standards elicited the best in US players. The ASL's
top three scorers were US players: Stark, Johnny Nelson, and Davie
Brown. And, in 1930, Fall River's Bert Patenaude scored the World
Cup's first hat trick as the US defeated Paraguay, 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   The ASL's imaginative, moneyed owners and promoters had cause
for optimism. Their game had roots in the culture, there was a
tremendous influx of immigration that seemed tailor-made to
perpetuate soccer's growth, and there were not many competing
professional sports. The ASL had accomplished American players,
exotic foreigners, high-scoring teams, and seemed on the verge of
challenging baseball's popularity or at least providing a
high-profile, viable alternative.
</P>
<P>
   But the ASL's decline was rapid, as bureaucratic crises weakened
the league, then the Wall Street crash brought down the industrial
sponsors and their teams, reducing the league to semiprofessional
status through 1983. The current A League is a descendent of the
1990 merger of the ASL and Western League.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps the greatest testimony to the standard of play in the
ASL in those years was produced by the US national team, which
reached the semifinal of the World Cup in 1930,'' Jose writes.
``These were known as the `Golden Years' of soccer in the US, years
when the game seemed to have a bright future, both as a spectator
and participation sport. Great players such as Gonsalves,
Patenaude, and Stark, had they played in the mainstream of European
soccer, would have achieved international acclaim, but they chose
to live and play in the US.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Zenga takes honor &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution's Walter Zenga was named MLS player of the week
after leading the team to a 1-0 win at Kansas City Saturday. Zenga
becomes the first player-coach to win the MLS honor . . . The
Revolution claimed striker Tony Kuhn on waivers from the Chicago
Fire . . . Midfielder Leighton O'Brien, waived by the Revolution
last week, was clamed by San Jose. O'Brien is the son of Fran
O'Brien, formerly of the Philadelphia Fury, Manchester City, and
the Republic of Ireland national team . . . Tickets for the
Revolution's July 21 exhibition against four-time European champion
Ajax are available.

POLAROID PEGS COMEBACK TO MARKETING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ After years of stagnant sales and steep
losses, Polaroid Corp. is finally rolling out new instant
photography products that could determine whether the company can
shake off its decade-long slump.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the first time in more than five years that Polaroid
will have significant consumer products to launch, is a pivotal one
for the fallen instant photography giant. It's betting on a trio of
new cameras named PopShots, JoyCam, and PocketCam, all under $30
and aimed at a new generation of consumers _ preteens, teenagers
and young adults, many of whom would be new to instant photography.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the year Polaroid has to break out of its no-growth
pattern,'' says Robert Stern, photography analyst at Merrill Lynch
Global Securities. ``These new products give (it) that chance.''
</P>
<P>
   But skeptics say the products may be too little, too late.
Analysts wonder whether Polaroid's offerings may end up as novelty
items without staying power. And even if Polaroid's cameras are
winners, they may not be enough to fix the company's fundamental
problem: competitors eating away at Polaroid's once invincible
dominance in instant photography.
</P>
<P>
   The new cameras are a hallmark of Polaroid chief executive Gary
T. DiCamillo, a marketing expert hired in December 1995 from Black
&AMP; Decker to turn the Cambridge company around. His strategy: Focus
anew on Polaroid's core consumer photography business, repackage
existing technology, emphasize marketing, and come up with modest
product hits rather than bet-the-ranch initiatives. DiCamillo last
year said the company planned to introduce 20 to 30 products over
four years.
</P>
<P>
   DiCamillo's approach is a departure _ some would say a comedown
_ from the 62-year-old company's legacy of world-beating
engineering and pioneering products.
</P>
<P>
   In its golden era from the 1970s through early 1980s, under
founder Edwin Land and his immediate successors, Polaroid
flourished with a wide range of cameras and film for consumers and
industry _ all built on technological innovation, memorable
television advertising, and ironclad patent protection.
</P>
<P>
   But the 1990s have not been kind to Polaroid. The rise of new
technologies _ one-hour color film processing, single-use cameras
from competitors, videotape camcorders, and digital cameras _ have
drastically changed the world of photography. Not only are there
more choices for capturing images, but the total cost for each
picture has dropped substantially.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to keep up, Polaroid has seen its annual sales stuck at
$2 billion since 1991. Last year, revenue fell 14 percent to $1.85
billion, the lowest since 1988. The company has lost money five out
of the last 10 years, including $359 million in red ink in the last
four years.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1996, Polaroid has made more headlines for laying off
nearly 3,000 people and closing manufacturing plants than for
delivering innovative products.
</P>
<P>
   Investors who bought Polaroid shares at $48 each in January
1996, a month after DiCamillo joined the company, have seen the
stock plunge to 17 a share in January. It closed Thursday at 19
15/16, down 1/4.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been watching Polaroid gradually circle the drain for
years,'' says B. Alex Henderson, photography analyst at Prudential
Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Now, under DiCamillo, Polaroid aims to reach a new generation of
instant photography buyers by repackaging some existing camera and
film products, rather than developing products based on major new
technical innovations. That's a departure from the approach of the
Edwin Land generation of Polaroid leaders, who made heavy bets on
new products using advanced technology developed internally.
</P>
<P>
   In a contrast to such technology-driven management, DiCamillo
has brought in a team of consumer marketing executives such as
Jerry Noonan, a former marketing executive from Nabisco Holdings
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Polaroid's trio of new, inexpensive cameras aimed at the young
exemplify the new strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going after markets that were never exploited by
Polaroid,'' says Noonan.
</P>
<P>
   To reach its youthful prospects, Polaroid is looking to sell
some camera and film products through toy retailers like Toys ``R''
Us and FAO Schwarz. Polaroid is also expanding sales of its
products through convenience stores, pharmacies, mass
merchandisers, and such discounters as Kmart, Wal-Mart, and BJ's
Wholesale Club.

   ``We are developing a new photography category for the retail
toy market, where stores like Toys `R' Us sell certain cameras and
film aimed at kids. Right now there is not much in photography for
9 to 14 year olds,'' notes Noonan, senior vice president of
worldwide marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, PopShots, the first of Polaroid's new cameras,
debuted on retail shelves. It's the company's first single-use
camera and is expected to compete against disposable cameras from
Kodak and Fuji that use 35-millimeter color film.
</P>
<P>
   PopShots is a 10-picture instant camera and film combination
that sells for $19.95 and includes a flash. A stiff tug on a yellow
ring removes the print, which takes about three minutes to develop.
Polaroid also offers a $4 rebate when the PopShots plastic camera
is sent back to the company for recycling.
</P>
<P>
   ``PopShots sales were slow until we advertised it to our members
and then it took off,'' says Michael Atkinson, vice president of
divisional merchandising at BJ's.
</P>
<P>
   But skeptics note that Polaroid is late to the disposable camera
game. Other single-use cameras have been on the market for several
years.
</P>
<P>
   Polaroid also plans to introduce a reusable version of PopShots
this fall. Called the JoyCam, it will cost $24.99 plus $9 per film
pack. It's a low-end camera targeted to young adults that uses the
same film as PopShots.
</P>
<P>
   In its boldest move to grab young consumers, Polaroid will
introduce its pocket-sized, instant camera called PocketCam this
summer to American markets. Aimed at children and teenagers, some
models feature cartoon characters, such as Tweety Bird and the
Tasmanian Devil, licensed from Warner Brothers. Polaroid has also
licensed Barbie from Mattel; the doll's image will appear on the
PocketCam, which comes with an attached folding mirror and
heart-shaped picture frame.
</P>
<P>
   Priced at $24.99 including a six-picture film pack, PocketCam
takes up to 12 images, each the size of a large postage stamp. In
the fall, Polaroid will market a second PocketCam film pack that
turns out adhesive photos, which can be stuck on like decals.
</P>
<P>
   Polaroid says the PocketCam has been a huge success in Japan,
where it was launched last year. The firm has sold 100,000 cameras
there, primarily to girls taking photos of their classmates and
friends.
</P>
<P>
   Stern of Merrill Lynch expects Polaroid to sell $75 million
worth of PocketCam cameras and film worldwide this year. He expects
JoyCam will generate about $40 million in sales this year. PopShots
along with non-instant photography products should do about $50
million, he estimates.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of new cameras and film could bring $130 million
to $165 million in critically needed new revenue to Polaroid this
year, rising to around $250 million annually in 2000, according to
several analysts.
</P>
<P>
   The new products, say analysts, should lift Polaroid to
profitability this year after four years of losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, Polaroid has the products to give them top-line
growth,'' says Stern.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Polaroid's bet on the youth market has risks. It remains
unclear whether PocketCam's popularity in Japan can be duplicated
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does Polaroid really want to bet on the purchasing habits and
whims of 13-year-old Japanese girls?'' asks Henderson of Prudential
Securities. ``Polaroid is playing in the toy business that is
hits-driven, where you can be hot as a pistol one day and ice cold
the next.''
</P>
<P>
   What's more, critics say, Polaroid has been slow in launching
these products. They point to the company's show-and-tell
extravaganza in New York in February 1998, when it announced the
trio of new cameras. At the time, the company said that PocketCam
and PopShots would reach the nation's retail shelves during 1998.
</P>
<P>
   They never did.
</P>
<P>
   And because of cost pressures, the company has indefinitely
shelved plans to create a combination camera that produces instant
photos and 35-millimeter negatives and another combination camera
that yields instant photos along with digitally stored images.
</P>
<P>
   While DiCamillo has received mixed reviews for Polaroid's
product initiatives, he has received high marks from Wall Street
for cutting costs and focusing more tightly on consumer markets.
The Polaroid chief, whose five-year employment contract expires in
November 2000, is shrinking the company to about 8,500 employees
worldwide _ from more than 11,000 when he took over and 21,000 in
1983.
</P>
<P>
   To keep costs down, the company makes virtually all new instant
camera and film products in China and other low-wage countries _ a
move that has prompted Polaroid to close some Massachusetts
production facilities. In another streamlining move, the company
left its longtime corporate home in Kendall Square for a
Polaroid-owned building on Memorial Drive that had been mothballed.
</P>
<P>
   And Polaroid is so focused on consumer photography these days
that it is looking to shed four of its businesses _ sunglasses,
polarizer filters for sunglasses, holography products, and graphic
arts equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Land launched the company back in 1937 with the polarizer
technology that he had invented. If Polaroid sheds the polarizer
business that had been its foundation, it truly will have wandered
far from its roots.

FINALLY, A COMEDY WORTH A SERIOUS LAUGH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TIM GOODMAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The last few television seasons have not been
kind to sitcoms. With their predictable insert-joke-here moments
and embarrassing laugh tracks, sitcoms have not been kind to
viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Fixing the state of the sitcom has been as pressing in the TV
business as fixing the Y2K bug has been to the world. But along the
way dramas improved _ ``ER,'' ``The Practice,'' ``Ally McBeal,''
``The Sopranos.'' Then reality programs nearly ruined television,
taking us on a painful, circuitous detour from which we have yet to
return. And the few great sitcoms _ ``Seinfeld,'' ``The Larry
Sanders Show,'' ``The Simpsons'' _ joined a handful of good sitcoms
to distract networks from the urgency of the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Sitcom writing was bad. Period. For the most part, it's still
bad. This made thin, toss-off shows that were merely cute _ like
``Dharma &AMP; Greg'' _ seem like strokes of inspiration. Never mind
that faded, past-their-prime offerings like ``Mad About You'' and
``Home Improvement'' sustained themselves in the ratings.
</P>
<P>
   So many live-action sitcoms have come and gone _ or in the case
of ``Veronica's Closet'' and ``Jesse'' should be gone _ that it's
difficult to even dream of something consistently witty, like a new
``Friends.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, there is one: ``Will &AMP; Grace.'' More miraculously, it's
on NBC, the network that did more damage by spinning off hordes of
lousy cookie-cutter sitcoms than good by having several classics
like ``Frasier'' and ``Seinfeld.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's a network so clueless as to quality comedy that it can't
stop shifting the few good ones it has around the dial, effectively
bleeding audience along the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will &AMP; Grace'' is a gem. Call it a miracle because, true to
fashion, NBC put it on Monday night (surrounded by lameness), then
moved it to Tuesday night before finally settling on its new night
_ Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will &AMP; Grace'' has a loyal core. It's fairly regularly found
in the Nielsen Top 20. But it ought to be in the Top 10 or better,
given that it's one of the few sitcoms going these days that seems
infused with smart humor, pop culture savvy and a ridiculously high
percentage of payoff punch lines.
</P>
<P>
   In short _ finally, the next great sitcom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will &AMP; Grace'' is about two best friends, the gay (but not
obvious) Will (Eric McCormack) and the straight (and desperate)
Grace (Debra Messing). Theirs is a great friendship, a perfect
foundation for a relationship except for that one slight problem.
The writers have managed to make this coupling not only very funny
but touching as well, difficult territory in a sitcom that _
rightly so _ emphasizes put-downs over pouting.
</P>
<P>
   The characters click thanks to the obvious chemistry of
McCormack and Messing. But the cast is fleshed out in terrific
fashion by Will's gay friend Jack (Sean Hayes) and Grace's sassy
co-worker Karen (Megan Mullally).
</P>
<P>
   To know how strong this cast is you only have to imagine that
both Hayes and Mullally could _ and probably will someday _ have
spinoff shows. Without McCormack and Messing's acting strengths,
those other two would be scene stealers.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, that's a spritely foursome and each gets enough lines
to enliven the full 22 minutes. No amount of overstatement can tell
you how rare non-stop good writing is on sitcoms. Only the
curiously maligned ``Friends'' continues to have that level of
sustained quality.
</P>
<P>
   To sit back and quote line after line of ``Will &AMP; Grace''
dialogue would do a disservice not only to how well the jokes were
delivered but also to how effectively they rock the viewer.
</P>
<P>
   This freshman series is not yet in the league of a ``Seinfeld''
or ``Larry Sanders'' or ``Simpsons.'' But it will be on Thursdays
for the foreseeable future _ at least until the finale, May 13 _
and if NBC has any sense, for next season.

ROVING AMBASSADORS TO HIT SEATTLE STREETS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEVEN GOLDSMITH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Forty roving ``ambassadors'' will welcome tourists _
and try to keep street people from bothering them _ under a major
new program to make downtown Seattle more visitor-friendly.
</P>
<P>
   Downtown property owners will pay more than $3 million a year
for the program that includes the ambassadors, 24 graffiti removers
and sidewalk sweepers as well as other workers to spruce up
downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Already approved by property owners and likely to win Seattle
City Council OK, the Downtown Business Improvement Area could be
operating by late summer.
</P>
<P>
   The program will replace three smaller districts and also cover,
for the first time, downtown's high-rise midsection.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be new strength in unification,'' said Kate Joncas,
president of the Downtown Seattle Association, which will run the
program.
</P>
<P>
   Modeled after similar operations in Portland, Ore., Baltimore
and Philadelphia, Seattle's program aims to put visitors and local
shoppers at ease in the urban streetscape.
</P>
<P>
   The ambassadors won't be police officers but will wear
distinctive uniforms, Joncas said. They can give tourists a smile
and a map, then steer a homeless, addicted or mentally ill person
to a social agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walking through downtown Seattle can be a challenging
experience,'' says the new program's business plan. ``While some
blocks are clean and secure, others are poorly maintained and
become locations for criminal activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Councilwoman Jan Drago, a strong advocate for the larger
improvement area, said the roving ambassadors will be a bit like
hotel concierges who can guide visitors through unfamiliar terrain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a particularly friendly presence on the street,'' said
Drago, who has made several trips to study Portland's program.
</P>
<P>
   But Gerald Sheehan, legislative director of the American Civil
Liberties Association, said the program should write guidelines for
the ambassadors to avoid stepping on individual rights.
</P>
<P>
   Sheehan said city officials were overly zealous in keeping
dissenters out of view during the 1992 Asia-Pacific Economic
Conference hosted by Seattle, and he worries the new downtown
ambassadors could contribute to such an atmosphere when the World
Trade Organization gathers here in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something we're definitely interested in knowing more
about,'' Sheehan said.
</P>
<P>
   Less controversial are the crews to scour sidewalks every day.
The city now cleans downtown streets but not sidewalks. The workers
also will paint over graffiti and monitor eyesores such as grimy
alleys, burned-out street lights and overflowing trash bins.

WNBA FILLS EXPANSION DRAFT SPOTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nykesha Sales finally has some teammates, but when they will
begin their season has suddenly been thrown into doubt.
</P>
<P>
   As the first player assigned to the Orlando Miracle, the former
University of Connecticut star has been the entire team since last
September. Thanks to Tuesday's WNBA expansion draft, the former
University of Connecticut star will soon be joined by Brandy Reed
(from the Phoenix Mercury), Kisha Ford (New York Liberty), Yolanda
Moore (Houston Comets), and Adrienne Johnson (Cleveland Rockers).
</P>
<P>
   On the other expansion team, the Minnesota Lynx, assigned player
Kristin Folkl has new teammates in Andrea Congreaves (Charlotte
Sting), Kim Williams (Utah Starzz), Octavia Blue (Los Angeles
Sparks), and Adia Barnes (Sacramento Monarchs).
</P>
<P>
   But thanks to a labor dispute, the scheduled start of the
league's third season on June 10 is in question.
</P>
<P>
   According to the players' union, the league has set Saturday as
the deadline for a contract agreement. The players reportedly want
a minimum salary of $45,000 for the three-month summer season,
while the WNBA is proposing $20,000, although the league says its
total compensation package is worth $60,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time is getting short,'' WNBA president Val Ackerman told USA
Today. ``We are committed to our players . . . but we are a
start-up business.''
</P>
<P>
   Also a point of contention: the number of players from the
now-defunct American Basketball League who will be allowed into the
WNBA. The league says 52, and wants to expand rosters to
accommodate them; the union says 24 and that players who opted for
the WNBA in the first place should not be shortchanged in the
aftermath of the ABL's demise.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming it goes off as scheduled, the regular draft on April 27
would include the former ABL players as well as foreign players and
those coming out of college.

   Kristine Pierce, a senior at the Rochester Institute of
Technology who has worked in soup kitchens, babysat for families
who couldn't afford to pay, and counseled children with learning
disabilities, was presented with the 1999 Hockey Humanitarian Award
last weekend at the NCAA Division 1 men's championship. Pierce, who
missed her freshman season while battling Hodgkin's disease, is
from Mendon, N.Y. Since 1996, the award foundation, based in
Randolph, has honored one collegiate hockey player each year who
``best exemplifies the qualities of character, sportsmanship, and
devotion to the game and to the community.'' Sara Nelson, a native
of Hanover, N.H., and senior forward at Dartmouth, was among the
five finalists . . . The Avon Running Global Women's Circuit,
launched last year and directed by Kathrine Switzer, will stage its
first Global Championship 10K on May 22 in New York as part of the
27-year-old all-women's ``mini marathon'' that had been sponsored
by Legg's and then Advil before Avon took over last year. About
8,000 runners are expected, with $50,000 in prize money going to
the top 15 overall finishers and top three master's finishers. The
champions of 12 Avon races last year will be brought to the event,
which will also likely draw many other top-ranked athletes. The
circuit will conduct 29 races in 12 countries this year; the
closest to Boston is Hartford on July 10. For more information or
an application, see the website at www.avonrunning.com or call
212-282-5350 . . . Among the 76 girls' sports programs awarded $500
from the 1999 Grants for Girls program were the Boys and Girls Club
of Chicopee (tennis), the Waterville Area Boys and Girls Club YMCA
in Maine (volleyball), Girls Incorporated of N.H. (climbing), and
the Girl Scouts of Rhode Island Inc. (softball). The grants are
supported by Procter &AMP; Gamble, private donors, and the Women's
Sports Foundation . . . Billie Jean King will receive an honorary
degree next month from the University of Pennsylvania.

NORMAN HAS NEW PERSPECTIVE ON THE MASTER'S 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ Greg Norman seemed content as the 63d Masters
approached, content with his life and the inactivity following
shoulder surgery he had shortly after last year's tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was asked,'' he said, ``if I had a magic wand to wave, what
would I change? I'd change nothing right now. It's a great
reflection on the way my life is right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want things to keep going the way they are. I'm very
happy. I enjoy the way I'm hitting the golf ball. I know it's a
matter of time before I'll get back to the winner's circle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to force it. I'm very easy about things. I'm very
relaxed. I want things to evolve. One thing I realized is golf is
not everything. There's nothing out there I enjoy doing more than
golf, and I think basically that's come out in the last 12 months
and why I am the way I am now. I don't have a sense of urgency
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman has been a dominant force in the game ever since he left
his Australian homeland and joined the US PGA Tour on a regular
basis in 1984, but he has been noted as much for the majors that
slipped away from him as for the two British Opens he has won. Just
three years ago, he saw a six-shot lead on Nick Faldo dissipate in
the final round of the Masters.
</P>
<P>
   That was the unkindest cut of all. Forget that he'd been beaten
by Bob Tway's holed-out bunker shot in the 1986 PGA Championship,
that Larry Mize had holed out from off the green to beat him on the
second hole of a playoff in the 1987 Masters, forget that he lost a
playoff to Fuzzy Zoeller in the 1984 US Open at Winged Foot, that
Marc Calcavecchia beat him in a playoff at the 1989 British Open at
Royal Troon, and that Paul Azinger beat him in a playoff at the
1993 PGA Chammpionship at Inverness.
</P>
<P>
   Norman also has been No. 1 in the world, has won 18 times on the
PGA Tour, and has 56 international victories. He's still the Great
White Shark, a dominant personality who has earned millions outside
the game through business interests and stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Though he says he has found inner peace, he still has a desire
to excel. ``It's not like it was when in my 20s the 30s, the
urgency to do it,'' he said. ``It's not the way it was 12 months
ago. I enjoy it so much more this way. I'm more in balance.''
</P>
<P>
   He still burns to win the Masters, and to that end he has worked
intensely with swing guru David Leadbetter. ``We're trying to
perfect my golf swing,'' said Norman, who has made three
appearances on the PGA Tour this year _ the World Match Play
Championships (second round), Doral (joint 19th), and The Players
Championship (missed cut). He withdrew from the BellSouth Classic
in Atlanta last week when he came down with a stomach virus.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was just happy to go through the motions, I wouldn't be
out there hitting balls Tuesday in 85-degree heat,'' he said. ``I
wouldn't spend hours with David Leadbetter. That's the other side
that's still there. You still want to do well, because you are a
competitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to go out on the first tee of the Masters this week,
and nothing would give me greater pleasure than sitting up here (in
the press building) talking to you again in a happy environment,
not like it was a couple of years ago. I still feel that. You guys
will be the first to know when it's time to walk away.''
</P>
<P>
   The drive to win still lurks within, especially at the Masters
and in the majors. ``Maybe I wanted to win this tournament too
much, but it's because of my nature,'' he said. ``I'm a very
forceful, hard-driven individual within myself. If I wasn't that
way, I wouldn't be sitting here today. Everybody's got a different
makeup. I'm a triple A personality. I might be a quadruple A
personality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've found the right equation to get myself to where I want to
be. Sometimes that can be a little detrimental to you, and
sometimes it can be a great asset. In this situation with the
Masters, as much as you want it, sometimes you get it and sometimes
you don't.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I never get this golf tournament, there still wouldn't be a
golf tournament on this planet I can say I've enjoyed more than
this one. I've taken a lot of great things out of the Masters. If I
stopped this and it was my last tournament and I didn't win it, I'd
say the Masters had a great stamp on my life and how my life turned
out.''

LOROUPE RECORD CROSSES A LINE IN BOSTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- A year ago, the day before the Boston Marathon, Tegla
Loroupe broke the legendary Ingrid Kristiansen's 13-year-old world
record by finishing the Rotterdam Marathon in 2 hours 20 minutes 47
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Or did she?
</P>
<P>
   Not according to the Boston Athletic Association. When the women
leave the starting line in Hopkinton April 19, it will be
Kristiansen's time of 2:21:06 they will be chasing to claim the
race's $50,000 world-best bonus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tegla's time at Rotterdam, while extraordinary, we feel was
way over the edge in terms of outside aid and support,'' said race
director Guy Morse, following the lead of USA Track &AMP; Field, which
has declined to recognize it as the world record.
</P>
<P>
   ``We consider the time by Tegla to be one in which she received
unfair assistance,'' explained Ryan Lamppa, statistician for USATF.
``We don't want to penalize Tegla, but we think it was such an
extreme case of assistance we felt we needed to draw the line.''
</P>
<P>
   The controversy over Loroupe's performance erupted almost
immediately after she crossed the finish line in a race that was
geared toward producing a world record for both Loroupe and her
male counterpart, Spain's Fabian Roncero. When Roncero's effort
fell short, all eyes fell on the 25-year-old Kenyan who finished
second in Boston in 1996 when Uta Pippig won after a heroic
comeback in the last 1 1/2 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Because there are no international standards for marathon rules,
or records for either men or women, much less consensus on whether
women should even be allowed to set world records in races that
include men, the issue is not likely to be resolved soon. Neither
the International Amateur Athletics Federation nor the Association
of International Marathons and Road Races ratify world records for
races run on the roads rather than the track.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no quality leadership at the international level
where the races can look to for a set of criteria that are
defensible,'' said Morse. ``It certainly would be helpful in this
case.''
</P>
<P>
   In this case, Loroupe's ``unfair assistance'' came, according to
Lamppa and others, on three fronts: She was paced from start to
finish by at least two male Kenyan runners; she was handed fluids
rather than having to fetch them for herself; and, in the latter
stages of the race, she was given instructions, information, and
encouragement from race director Jos Hermens as he rode alongside
on a motorcycle.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would not happen in our country based on our rules,''
said Lamppa.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, some pacing _ even by men of women _ is
considered acceptable. But assistance in either getting
refreshments or information that would afford an advantage over
one's competitors is not.
</P>
<P>
   For Loroupe, the men who set the pace for her also shielded the
diminutive Kenyan from the wind, allowing her to draft off them as
would a bicyclist. They relayed her ``split times,'' or the time it
took her to run each mile, so she would know if she needed to speed
up to stay on a record pace. They handed her fluids, which meant
she didn't have to battle the crowds, risking jostling and using up
energy, to get to the tables that held her drinks. These were all
advantages her competitors didn't have.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have help to do everything during the race, that is not
good,'' said Kristiansen, who acknowledges that she was paced by
men until the halfway mark of her world-record run in 1985 but said
she did the rest on her own.
</P>
<P>
   Tellingly, even though neither the IAAF nor AIMS designate times
as world records (or world bests, as road performances are often
designated to take into account the differences in degree of
difficulty one course to another), both have indicated they would
look askance at Loroupe's mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IAAF regrets that this
`let's-have-a-record-at-whatever-cost' attitude casts doubt on
Tegla Loroupe's otherwise admirable performance,'' said IAAF
general secretary Istvan Gyulai in a statement. ``Clearly, if there
existed official world records in road races, Loroupe's time would
not be ratified. So it remains `only' a world best performance, a
questionable one, although this is not Loroupe's fault.''
</P>
<P>
   AIMS, while recognizing and lauding her time as the fastest in
history, stops short of calling it either a world record or a world
best.
</P>
<P>
   One way around the assistance question, some people think, is
for women's records to be set solely in women-only races, or races
such as London in which women start 30 minutes before the men.
Lamppa is one of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point the sport will evolve into that,'' he said. ``I
think that makes sense. Then there will be no question (of unfair
assistance).
</P>
<P>
   Because the women run separately in the London Marathon, that
event is using still another world-record standard. Although race
officials did not return phone calls seeking clarification, it is
known the race was trying to decide between the 2:21:46 run by
Japan's Naoko Takahashi in the women-only Asian Games marathon last
December, run point-to-point, or Romanian Lidia Simon's 2:23:24 in
the Osaka Women's Marathon last January, which is run on a loop
course.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the chaos, said Morse, there might be no world
records at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the final analysis, the sport might determine that each
competition is so unique that you should not compare,'' he said.
``That's an option that makes sense if there is no consensus.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, at least one observer thinks Loroupe _ who has a
2:23:46 to her credit in the all-women's Osaka last January as well
as a 2:22:07 in Rotterdam two years ago _ will break the world
record anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``She can make it again,'' said Kristiansen. ``If she is good
enough to run with rabbits, she can do it by herself. Train one or
two more years and she can make it.''

EXPULSION FROM NAVAL ACADEMY PENDING AGAINST TEXAS MIDSHIPMAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GABRIELLE CRIST 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Birk Billingsley's first love was the U.S.
Naval Academy, and his second, more recent, love was a freshman in
his squad.
</P>
<P>
   Now the 22-year-old Texan's affair with the academy could be
nearing an end because he broke the rules by having an ``unduly
familiar'' relationship with Kristina Shiroma, an underclassman,
also from Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The two have been expelled from the academy, 25 days before
Billingsley was to graduate. Their expulsions are pending approval
by the Office of the Secretary of the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a mistake. There's really no excuse for my actions _ I
fell in love,'' said Billingsley, of Dublin. But, he added, ``I
really don't think what I did warrants my expulsion from the
academy.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Billingsley, who was Shiroma's squad leader, could have to
repay $93,000 for his education or enlist for three years,
``neither of which are too appealing to me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am appalled because others that committed actions that were
far more egregious'' have not been expelled, Billingsley said in a
telephone interview yesterday from his mother's home in Paris,
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Billingsley, who was a 1995 graduate of Dublin High School and a
straight-A student, said he and Shiroma, of Richardson, were
intimate but did not have sexual intercourse. He pleaded guilty to
sexual misconduct, fraternization and failure to maintain a proper
relationship with a plebe, and Shiroma pleaded guilty to similar
charges.
</P>
<P>
   They are not the first to be disciplined for sexual misconduct
or fraternization at the Naval Academy, where midshipmen are not
allowed to engage in sexual relations on campus or have a romantic
involvement with a freshman.
</P>
<P>
   Four midshipmen were expelled this year, and five were expelled
last year, said Cmdr. Mike Brady, a Naval Academy spokesman, who
noted that the recommendations, including the one concerning
Billingsley, await approval by the Office of the Secretary of the
Navy.
</P>
<P>
   But other midshipmen who have had sex or romantic relationships
with freshmen have not been expelled, said Billingsley's attorney,
Bill Ferris, a Naval Academy graduate. Some midshipmen who had sex
with freshmen off campus have not been expelled; others have been
expelled for much less intimate behavior, Ferris said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This thing is applied arbitrarily and capriciously,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ferris cited last year's case involving Navy quarterback Chris
McCoy, who was accused of having sex off campus with a freshman.
</P>
<P>
   The freshman, who was also accused of having sex with two other
midshipmen on campus, was expelled, but McCoy wasn't, said Ferris,
who represented the freshman in the decision review process.
</P>
<P>
   And last fall, in an incident similar to Billingsley's, senior
Colin Gallagher had a relationship with a plebe who he'd requested
be placed in his squad, Ferris states in documents relating to
Billingsley's decision review process.
</P>
<P>
   Neither was expelled in that case, Ferris states in the
document.
</P>
<P>
   But each case will be handled differently because ``sexual
misconduct includes a wide range of prohibited behavior,'' Brady
said. ``It's wrong to assume that every case should be handled
identically.''
</P>
<P>
   And after Vice Adm. John R. Ryan assumed command as the
academy's superintendent in June, he met with all midshipmen last
fall and told them he was placing a ``bubble'' around all freshmen
and insisted on ``only professional relationships between plebe and
upperclassmen,'' according to a transcript of Ryan's speech that
Brady provided.
</P>
<P>
   Billingsley, who has studied astronautical engineering, said he
plans to apply to Stanford, Purdue and Georgia Tech to finish
college.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, he and his attorney are hoping that the Office
of the Secretary of the Navy will review the decision and reinstate
Billingsley.
</P>
<P>
   Billingsley, who in high school was senior class president and
active in the honor society, said he's dreamed of graduating from
the academy since he was a child, and hoped to one day become an
astronaut. His experience at the academy has ``been great up to
this point,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to go back,'' Billingsley said. ``I love that school
and what it stands for.''

McCAIN'S POLITICAL STOCK RISES AS BOMBS FALL &HT;    By BENNETT ROTH 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Until two weeks ago, Sen. John McCain of Arizona
was just one in a large field of likely Republican presidential
candidates struggling for recognition.
</P>
<P>
   But what a difference a war makes.
</P>
<P>
   As the United States and its allies have pounded Yugoslavia, the
former Vietnam War pilot and prisoner of war has seen his political
stock rise.
</P>
<P>
   The 62-year-old Naval Academy graduate has been much in demand
on the national media circuit because of his military background
and foreign policy experience in the Senate, where he serves on the
Armed Services Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Citing the airstrikes, McCain put on hold his presidential
announcement scheduled for Tuesday. But he has gained more exposure
from talking about the strikes than his political plans.
</P>
<P>
   In one day, he appeared on all of the major television networks,
where he was almost always introduced as a former POW.
</P>
<P>
   He has been a guest on CNN's ``Larry King Live'' and
``Crossfire'' and ABC's ``Nightline.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Serbs captured three U.S. soldiers last week, it was
McCain whom the media sought to talk about his five-year ordeal in
a North Vietnamese prisoner-of-war camp.
</P>
<P>
   McCain advised the administration not to let the capture of
soldiers affect its military strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Ensuring more publicity, McCain joined Defense Secretary William
Cohen on a visit Wednesday to Aviano Air Force Base in Italy, where
the United States is launching its flights over Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's stance on Kosovo is both critical of the Clinton
administration and at odds with the isolationist-leaning faction of
his own party.
</P>
<P>
   The senator blasted the White House for what he termed its
failure to articulate a strategy or endgame for the Yugoslavia
operation.
</P>
<P>
   But he also has broken with many of his Republican colleagues by
endorsing not only a strong air campaign but sending ground troops
into Kosovo as well.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said his presidential ambition was not a factor in his
decision to speak out for strong military action in Kosovo. He
noted that he had been equally assertive about military campaigns
during the Persian Gulf War and Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have spoken out on these issues and have some credibility
for many years now,'' he said. ``I have not considered them in the
context of a presidential campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   The senator also said there is a downside to backing heavy U.S.
military action abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I take a position where I advocate the president not rule
out the use of ground troops, I take a responsibility for any
casualties that may occur,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has postponed his formal presidential announcement,
McCain said, ``I am running.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, some political observers agree the military conflict
has helped McCain to stand out among the large GOP presidential
field.
</P>
<P>
   ``He brings a weight and gravity to these matters that many of
the other candidates just can't match,'' said Steve Duprey,
chairman of the New Hampshire Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Duprey said foreign policy will likely be a bigger issue in 2000
than it has been in the past two elections because of Kosovo and
the Chinese spy scandal. But he doubted that foreign policy
expertise alone would allow McCain to ``break out of the pack,''
unless he spends more time in primary states talking about other
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Polls consistently rank McCain well behind Gov. George W. Bush
and Elizabeth Hanford Dole.
</P>
<P>
   David Hill, a Houston-based Republican consultant, said McCain
may not be doing himself that much good because voters already are
familiar with his military record.
</P>
<P>
   What they don't know, Hill contended, is where McCain stands on
a host of domestic issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it adds a lot to him. It doesn't round him
out,'' Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   The boom for McCain may quickly die out when the conflict ends,
as former President Bush found out when his successes in the 1991
Gulf War did not help him win re-election more than a year later.
</P>
<P>
   For now, McCain clearly has been able to stand out from his
rivals as he effectively uses his platform in the Senate to
articulate a war strategy.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's strength on the issue may underscore the foreign policy
weaknesses of some of his opponents _ particularly Gov. Bush, whose
belated response to the crisis was criticized as tentative and
vague.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who served in the Texas Air National Guard, did not
publicly respond to the Kosovo matter until several days after the
bombing started and only after he consulted with his advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he supported the airstrikes but said the
administration needed to develop an exit strategy. The governor
also said, ``If the mission is to win, all options ought to be
available to military planners.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes said criticism of the governor has
been ``unjustified.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At a time when American lives are at stake is not the time for
political leaders to be grandstanding and second-guessing,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL ADD END)
</P>
<P>
   Dan Quayle, the former vice president who served in the Indiana
National Guard during the Vietnam War, has criticized the Kosovo
mission and opposes the use of ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   Dole, who has supported the Clinton administration's policy in
Kosovo, was not eligible for combat duty because of her gender.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Buchanan, who has opposed the Kosovo mission, did not serve
in the military because of rheumatoid arthritis. Magazine mogul
Steve Forbes, who has supported airstrikes but not ground troops,
served for six months in the New Jersey National Guard.
Conservative activist Gary Bauer, who has opposed the military
operation, did not serve because of college and law school draft
deferments.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire Sen. Bob Smith, who has opposed the Kosovo
operation, served one year in Vietnam in the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, Vice President Al Gore served one year
in Vietnam as an army journalist. Former New Jersey senator Bill
Bradley, who has criticized the U.S. mission in Kosovo, was in the
Air Force reserve from 1967 to 1978.

<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ In an attempt to win a shorter sentence for
followers of David Koresh, lawyers Tuesday argued once again that
five Branch Davidians neither used nor carried automatic weapons in
a deadly 1993 shootout with federal agents.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the five cult members are serving 40-year sentences _ 10
years for manslaughter and another 30 years tacked on by Judge
Walter Smith when he ruled that the Davidians wielded machine guns
in the firefight rather than basic firearms. The judge gave the
fifth defendant a 10-year sentence on the use of an automatic
weapon.
</P>
<P>
   But lawyers for the cult members say evidence is scant that the
five employed automatic weapons. More importantly, they say, the
five should have been formally charged with the weapons violation
and Smith should have left the decision to the jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel the judge does not have the decision-making power,''
said Steven Rocket Rosen, a Houston lawyer representing one of the
five. ``The jury does.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers appealed the decision in 1996, two years after 11 Branch
Davidians were tried in San Antonio. In that case, all 11 were
acquitted of conspiracy and murder but eight were convicted on
lesser charges.
</P>
<P>
   Of those, six appealed, and upon hearing their arguments the 5th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans asked Judge Smith to
reconsider whether the cult members used automatic weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Smith ruled that they had, at which point lawyers for five cult
members appealed the decision yet again, bringing them Tuesday to
San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the difference between dying in federal prison or
getting out and having a little time to live,'' said Richard
Ferguson, one of the lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers say a recent decision by the U.S. Supreme Court
bolsters their case. That case involved a carjacking in which a
judge tacked on 25 years to the defendant's 15-year sentence
because the incident resulted in serious bodily injury.
</P>
<P>
   But the high court said the bodily injury decision should have
been made by the jury, not the judge.
</P>
<P>
   Four agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms were
killed in a gun battle at the Branch Davidians' fortified compound
near Waco on Feb. 28, 1993. The agents had sought to arrest Koresh
on weapons charges.
</P>
<P>
   Six followers of Koresh were killed in the fight, which led to a
stalemate that lasted 51 days before fire engulfed the compound,
killing Koresh and 78 others.
</P>
<P>
   Those appealing their cases Tuesday were Renos Avraam, Brad
Branch, Jaime Castillo, Graeme Craddock and Kevin Whitecliff.

FLIGHT WILL TEST FAA READINESS FOR YEAR 2000
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When midnight rolls around Dec. 31, Federal Aviation
Administration chief Jane Garvey will be flying from Washington,
D.C., to Los Angeles, convinced that the agency's Y2K problems are
solved and that her plane won't crash into another because of a
computer glitch.
</P>
<P>
   But just to make sure, Garvey will be in Denver this weekend as
the FAA conducts its first test to see whether its air traffic
control radar system is Year 2000-compatible.
</P>
<P>
   At 10 p.m. Saturday, the FAA will set its Denver air traffic
control clock forward to 10 p.m., Dec. 31, 1999, and fly one of its
planes on a four-hour loop around Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Garvey won't be on the plane. She will be watching the radar
screens at Denver International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's going to be a nonevent, like Samuel Beckett
wrote in his novel Murphy: `The sun shone, having no alternative,
on the nothing new,''' said Paul Takemoto, the FAA's Y2K spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're spending millions of dollars on Y2K fixes to make sure
nothing happens on Jan. 1, that it's just another day like any
other day,'' he said. ``We're getting nothing new for our money,
just making sure we continue the status quo.''
</P>
<P>
   The Denver test is above and beyond the individual systems tests
that the FAA is conducting on each of its computers nationwide, and
will be the first to track an aircraft in flight as the clock
changes from 1999 to 2000, said John Clabes, the FAA's Southwest
Region spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the FAA, we have 638 computer systems, and 425 of them are
considered mission critical,'' he said. ``Of the 425, we found that
151 needed to be renovated to avoid Y2K problems, and all of this
work is now scheduled to be completed by June 30.''
</P>
<P>
   As the FAA works to make sure all of its systems are go for
midnight Dec. 31, Dallas/Fort Worth Airport likewise is well into
its computer revisions to ensure a smooth transition into 2000,
said Jeff Fegan, Dallas/Fort Worth Airport's executive director.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have allocated $10 million to Y2K fixes, and we're on
schedule to have everything finished in September,'' he said. ``I'm
confident we will be ready.''
</P>
<P>
   The Y2K problem evolved from the practice of using only two
digits to designate the year in most computers. Y2K experts say
that means many computers will read the year 2000 as 00, and
interpret it as 1900 instead of 2000. Such a glitch could cause
many computers to shut down, they say.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA's major concern is tracking and control of aircraft in
flight, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Denver test won't affect any aircraft in the air at the
time, because the computers being tested _ at the Terminal Radar
Approach Control center that serves a 65-mile radius around Denver
_ are capable of being split into two separate-but-equal operating
systems, Takemoto said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll leave one half of the system on real time for the
controllers to use, and we'll turn the clock ahead on the other
half to test for Y2K compliance,'' he said. ``Controllers won't be
using the half that we have set to Dec. 31.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, that half will be monitored by a huge staff of FAA
engineers and computer experts, as well as by Garvey and Ray Long,
director of the FAA's Y2K Program Office.
</P>
<P>
   ``The VIP list for the test is pretty long,'' Takemoto said.
``We'll have airline people, air traffic controllers union people,
all kinds of people on hand to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   An FAA test plane _ a Learjet based in Oklahoma City _ will take
off from the Grand Junction, Colo., airport shortly after 10 p.m.,
fly to Denver and land, then fly to Colorado Springs, where it will
touch down just before the test period ends, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the test, 3 a.m. CDT, Garvey and Long will address
worldwide media representatives who also will be on hand but who
won't be allowed in the control room during the test.
</P>
<P>
   At the agency's Southwest Region headquarters in Fort Worth, Air
Traffic Manager Doug Murphy said he is convinced that the test will
show that the FAA has the Y2K problem under control.
</P>
<P>
   ``The year 2000 is on its way. We're going to be ready, people
are going to climb onto airplanes, and it's going to be as safe and
efficient as ever,'' he said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   As for the FAA's Southwest Region, which encompasses Arkansas,
Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas, ``We're in great
shape,'' Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   That's good news for pilots and passengers, because the FAA's
Terminal Radar Approach Control center at D/FW Airport is the
nation's busiest, airport officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the separate computers operated by the D/FW Airport
Board don't control aircraft in flight, there are systems under
D/FW's purview that operate essential services such as runway and
taxiway lights, emergency fire and medical services, terminal
heating and lighting, the interterminal train system, the parking
control system, and automated employee access to secure areas of
the airport, Fegan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had 108 computer systems we identified that required some
form of action, and we're now at 72 percent complete,'' he said.
``We feel very comfortable we will be in good shape come Jan. 1.''

SHALL I TAKE MYSELF OUT TO THE MINOR LEAGUES?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I'd been figuring that the hard-core baseball boycotters had
washed their hands of me and that the nonboycotters were tired of
my ambivalence _ to boycott or not to boycott, that is the question
_ and so I wasn't counting on much of a response to last week's
pre-season baseball column.
</P>
<P>
   It was definitely a pleasant surprise when I received a
supportive e-mail from a reader who shares my love/disgust
relationship with big-league baseball. The message came from a
longtime baseball fan by the name of Kirby Stiening:
</P>
<P>
   ``The Norfolk Virginian-Pilot printed your column on baseball
today, and I wanted to express my appreciation for your sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up in Pittsburgh in the '50s when the Pirates were a
joke, but that didn't keep me from going to Forbes Field and
sitting in the left-field bleachers. The 1960 World Series was
probably the highlight of my baseball days. I have not attended a
Major League Baseball game in over 30 years and have watched as the
game was transformed from the national pastime to just another
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do have an alternative way for you to maintain your boycott
while still watching old-time baseball. It's the minor-league
games. For under $10 I can see the Tidewater Tides from a better
seat than I ever saw Roberto Clemente, and the air is filled with a
spirit of family fun.''
</P>
<P>
   They are a breed apart, these baseball fans who grew up cheering
the exploits of all-time greats such as Clemente, Stan Musial of
the St. Louis Cardinals, Willie Mays of the New York/San Francisco
Giants, Mickey Mantle of the New York Yankees _ players who played
for the love of the game in an era when only the biggest stars
pulled down annual salaries in excess of $100,000, and when a
ballplayer never would have dreamed of charging a fan for an
autograph.
</P>
<P>
   One day during my deluded youth, I insisted that my mother take
me to a ribbon-cutting or some such event where Musial was the
featured celebrity. When he drove away, we followed him until he
had to stop at a red light _ at which point I jumped out of the
car, knocked on the window of his Cadillac and breathlessly
implored: ``Mr. Musial, could I please have your autograph?''
</P>
<P>
   He looked at me as if he thought I might be mentally deranged,
but he signed without so much as a grunt of irritation, and I've
been singing his praises ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Can you imagine what would happen if a kid ran up to ... oh,
let's say, Albert Belle while the Baltimore Orioles star was
waiting for a traffic light to change and asked him for an
autograph?
</P>
<P>
   On second thought, let's not imagine; the possibilities are too
gruesome.
</P>
<P>
   If the Orioles are paying Belle $65 million over five years, how
much would a Musial or a Clemente pull down in today's market?
Belle drives in plenty of runs, that's for sure, but the Cardinals
and Pirates never had to worry about their star player attacking a
fan or a photographer; those guys would be worth $65 million for
good citizenship alone.
</P>
<P>
   As a Pirates fan, Kirby Stiening no doubt treasures the memory
of that 1960 World Series more than a Cardinals fan who stayed up
till the wee hours one late-season night to watch Musial beat
Pittsburgh with an extra-inning homer. But who could forget Bill
Mazeroski's seventh-game, ninth-inning home run that edged the
Yankees, 10-9, to give the Pirates their first world championship
since 1925?
</P>
<P>
   And what about Mazeroski, arguably the best defensive second
baseman in baseball history? What would he be worth to a modern-day
team that pays millions to bench warmers?
</P>
<P>
   Baseball doesn't like to say so, but its loyal and
long-suffering fans are picking up the tab for those outrageous
paychecks in the form of exorbitant prices for game admissions,
parking, concessions and licensed products such as caps and
T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why I'm staying away. I'll skip the minor-league games
as well because I'm worried that my $10 will work its way up to the
big-league affiliate.
</P>
<P>
   The onetime pastime gets no dough from me. None.

 &HT;    TRAVELING PHOTO EXHIBIT SHOWS DIVERSITY OF AMERICAN HISPANICS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (l) lifestyle categories.
 &HT;    By EUNICE MOSCOSO

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ New images of American life color the walls of the
Smithsonian Institution: photographs of astronauts, doctors, altar
boys, fishermen, White House staffers, soccer players and
ballerinas.
</P>
<P>
   All Hispanic-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what we are. We're black. We're white. We're brown.
We're Asian. We're mixed. We're Catholic. We're Jew. We're
Protestant. We are everything that everyone is,'' said actor Edward
James Olmos, who developed a multimedia project documenting the
diverse experience of the nation's Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   The photographic exhibit _ ``Americanos: Latino Life in the
United States'' _ opened Wednesday at the Smithsonian's National
Museum of American History.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit, which includes 120 photographs organized around
themes such as family, community, education and sports, will become
the largest traveling photo exhibit in the history of the museum.
</P>
<P>
   After September, it will travel to the Museum of the City of New
York and to the Eiteljorg Museum in Indianapolis early next year.
It is already booked through 2003, including stops in Houston and
San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an honor and a real privilege to be standing here in the
Smithsonian Institution in this manner ... almost unbelievable,''
Olmos said at a news conference. Holding up a book of pictures from
the exhibit, he went from page to page, stating repeatedly, ``This
is an American.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These are images of people that have been here since the
existence of the human species in the Western Hemisphere,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Olmos said the exhibit is of major importance because Hispanics
are under-represented in the history, media and arts of American
culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``For this to be the very first exhibit of its kind to get to
this level is a disaster. We are not talking about 1899, we're
talking about 1999,'' he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The work of 30 photographers includes powerful portraits such as
the one of Bernadine Mendoza, wearing a Gap T-shirt and a gold
cross, sewing a new American flag in a Houston factory.
</P>
<P>
   Others, non-political but still dramatic, capture warm and
intriguing moments such as a bespectacled 8-year-old Carolina
Bernal gazing seriously at a chess board in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Olmos plans to visit San Antonio and Houston this month to
promote other parts of the multimedia project, including:
</P>
<P>
   _ A book of photographs from the exhibit published by Little,
Brown and Co. The book includes an introduction by Carlos Fuentes,
considered Mexico's leading novelist.
</P>
<P>
   _ A television documentary that will debut on HBO this fall. It
features a series of short profiles of American Hispanics,
including the San Diego writers and performers known as the Taco
Shop Poets and a Mexican-born agent of the U.S. Border Patrol who
apprehends illegal aliens for a living.
</P>
<P>
   _ The release of a CD of Latin artists representing a wide range
of music, including the tejano sounds of Flaco Jimenez, the classic
salsa of Celia Cruz and the Latin jazz of Tito Puente.

METALLICA MEETS THE SYMPHONY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, April 11)  
 By NEVA CHONIN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The heavy-metal kingpins in Metallica and
classical/pop composer Michael Kamen have a lot in common. They
share a history of long hair and Grammy nominations, they both love
taking chances and they're all wondering if a 100-member orchestra
can hold its own against a stack of Marshall amps.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it's time for the much-anticipated meeting between
Stradivarius and Stratocaster in what promises to be the
unlikeliest musical collaboration since Deep Purple's ``Concerto
for Group and Orchestra.''
</P>
<P>
   For two sold-out shows on April 21 and 22 at the Berkeley
Community Theater, Metallica and the San Francisco Symphony, under
Kamen's direction, will perform more than 20 songs from the band's
booming repertoire.
</P>
<P>
   Kamen and the four members of Metallica _ singer-guitarist James
Hetfield, guitarist Kirk Hammett, bassist Jason Newsted and drummer
Lars Ulrich _ held a news conference in January to announce the
shows. This week, after some time off to recuperate from a grueling
tour, followed by a few warm-up gigs in Alaska and Hawaii, the band
will start rehearsing in earnest with the Symphony.
</P>
<P>
   There are sticky technical details to work out. Metallica has
promised fans it will play at full, bone-crushing volume. The
orchestra intends to do the same, but even with 100 musicians it
will need some help to be heard above the roar.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll amplify the orchestra, and thus hopefully achieve some
parity,'' Kamen says. ``There's no way that we could expect
Metallica to shed its skin and become a little chamber music band _
though we might try that for one song before turning on the
juice.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 20 months since Kamen initiated the project, he and
Metallica have met everywhere from San Francisco to London to New
York to Las Vegas, exchanging ideas on how to adapt the band's
music for a full orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   Ulrich says the award-winning pop classicist even joined
Metallica's tour last summer to imbibe ``the whole live thing. It
turns out that he's been interested in our music for a long time,
but apart from the occasional TV show, he'd never seen us tumble
people for 2 1/2 hours. He was very cool, very keen on broadening
his mind. He has a real lust for living, too. We had our share of
nights out on the town.''
</P>
<P>
   But the collaborators worked more than they partied, nailing
down a repertoire that will include tracks such as ``Enter
Sandman,'' ``Devil's Dance,'' ``Fight Fire With Fire,'' ``Hero of
the Day,'' ``Nothing Else Matters,'' ``Fuel,'' ``For Whom the Bell
Tolls'' and the live debut of ``The Outlaw Torn.''
</P>
<P>
   Kamen, 51, is a Juilliard-trained musician who has composed
ballet scores for companies ranging from Alvin Ailey to Milan's La
Scala. He's conducted Pavarotti. He's written soundtracks for
dozens of films, including the ``Lethal Weapon'' and ``Die Hard''
series. He's been fusing genres since he was a kid in New York,
having formed the New York Rock and Roll Ensemble, which
collaborated with the New York Philharmonic under Leonard
Bernstein. He's done orchestrations for Bob Dylan, Pink Floyd,
David Bowie, Aerosmith and a bevy of other rock acts.
</P>
<P>
   But, although the Symphony has collaborated with the surviving
members of the Grateful Dead, this is its first venture into heavy
metal. And the only classical music that Metallica knows is classic
rock.
</P>
<P>
   For Ulrich, that mutual innocence is part of the beauty. ``You
reach these milestones in your career where you throw yourself out
into completely unknown territory, and you sit there with your
confidence and your deranged approach,'' he says, laughing. ``You
just pull a war face and make everybody believe you know exactly
what you're doing when you really don't have a clue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have this expression in the band: Dare to fail. I wouldn't
say it's something we live and die by every day, but I do love the
idea of going into a situation where there's no safety net. I love
making s_ up as I go along, and I believe that if you're smart or
courageous or tenacious you can almost do anything you put your
mind to.''
</P>
<P>
   That's Kamen's philosophy, as well. ``Just as Metallica invents
what they're playing, I have to invent what the orchestra's
playing. It's designed as a conversation between all the musicians
onstage, in the true polyphonic tradition of orchestral writing.
But it's definitely a Metallica evening. We want to get the
orchestra to make a valid, comfortable statement within the
structure of the songs as they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Alas, the brass section probably won't stage-dive, the cellists
won't smash their instruments and a mosh pit is out of the
question. But the performances will feature the band's usual
elaborate staging and light shows. Audio and film crews will also
be in the mix, recording the shows for possible release.
</P>
<P>
   As for the audience, well, no one is quite sure what it will
look like.

</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to see a mixture out there,'' Hetfield says. ``It
would be great if symphony goers who'd otherwise never go to a
Metallica show escorted their kids, or kids who'd never go to the
symphony came with their parents. Hopefully, they can do a little
bonding. Not that bonding parents and kids is Metallica's goal in
life. This could help, or it could really cause a few new
dysfunctional families.''
</P>
<P>
   Kamen isn't making predictions. ``I don't think anybody,
including ourselves, knows what to expect,'' he says. ``It's a
really relevant way for an orchestra to present itself to a whole
new group of people, some of whom may never have heard an orchestra
before. I think it might interest them to find out that these
instruments, for all their antiquity, retain the power to
communicate feeling. It's that that we're talking about: We're all
musicians together.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are bound to be moments of fun and funny cultural
confusion. As Hetfield notes with a certain mischievous delight,
``We'll see what happens when one of us gives a nod to Kamen to
extend the jam because it feels good. It could go amazingly well or
horribly wrong. But we're not ones to always play it safe, and I
think we have the ability to tap-dance our way out of anything.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Kamen is just loving the project's ability to
raise eyebrows. ``I was just talking to a guy who said, `Aren't you
afraid that people are going to be drinking and smoking dope at the
concert?' I thought for a second, and then I said, `Well, no, not
as long as they share it.'''

   YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO CRISIS
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-MAIN _ WASHINGTON _ President Clinton says Belgrade's
cease-fire is ``not enough'' to avert more NATO air strikes. The
president said it's not enough for Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic
to halt attacks in a Kosovo. Clinton said Milosevic must withdraw
his forces, allow Albanian refugees to return and permit an
international peace force to deploy in Kosovo. Meanwhile, a
representative from Cyprus has flown to Belgrade to try to secure
the release of three U-S captives. He told reporters he's confident
his mission will succeed. The plan is to turn the soldiers over to
American officials once they're freed. Also, NATO claims to have
hit some Serb tanks. Developing. (Deans, Cox News Service).

   KOSOVO-BOSNIA _ SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Hercegovina _ Since the
airstrikes began, Bosnians have anxiously listened for the buzz of
the NATO bombers that fly over every day on their way to
neighboring Yugoslavia. But many observers worry the conflict next
door holds more than noise for this still very war-torn country. It
is hardening the ethnic divisions here, causing some to worry that
it could ultimately cause the break-up of Bosnia and the end of the
Dayton Peace Accords. Because while half the country listens to the
planes and hopes NATO will bomb the Serbs into submission and
rescue the Kosovo Albanians quickly, the other half, the Bosnian
Serb half, listens angrily to what they see as an attack on their
brethren across the border and talks of armed resistance. (Nesmith,

College President Delores Cross had made tough decisions without
blinking an eye, backing down or walking away. At 14, she had to
get a job to pay her family's rent in a Newark housing project
after her mother was committed to a mental institution; she also
overcame a stuttering problem. ``I didn't have the classic middle
class upbringing you normally associate with college presidents,''
Cross said. So, when she stood in front of an angry crowd of
faculty members on March 9 and told them that despite their pleas,
they would probably still get fired, it was not out of character.
Last Thursday, Cross fired several faculty members, fulfilling her
promise to start cleaning house to, in her opinion, restore

INSULIN INHALATOR IN FINAL TESTING STAGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JUDY RICHTER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A California company is in the final stages of
testing a device that would allow diabetics to administer daily
insulin doses through an inhalator rather than syringes.
</P>
<P>
   The device and the process for preparing inhalable insulin are
in the third stage of testing required for approval from the Food
and Drug Administration. If approved, the product could become
commercially available in three to five years.
</P>
<P>
   Inhale Therapeutic Systems Inc. of San Carlos, Calif., is
developing the device that could drastically ease the routine
millions of diabetics no go through to take insulin shots.
</P>
<P>
   Insulin is used to treat diabetes, a chronic disorder that
results when the pancreas either stops producing insulin or
produces insufficient amounts to process glucose (sugar), which the
body uses for energy. Diabetes can lead to blindness, kidney
damage, heart disease or stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Some 10.3 million Americans have been diagnosed with diabetes,
according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in
Atlanta, and millions more have undiagnosed diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   Although some diabetics can control their condition with diet
and oral medications, 3.5 million must inject insulin several times
a day for optimum control, according to a research report by Inhale
Therapeutic Systems.
</P>
<P>
   However, many diabetics don't follow that regimen because of the
discomfort and inconvenience, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since insulin was first used to treat diabetes in the
1920s, scientists have been looking for alternatives to injection,
said Robert Chess, an executive with the company.
</P>
<P>
   Insulin isn't effective in pill form because the digestive
system breaks down the drug before it reaches the bloodstream.
</P>
<P>
   When Inhale Therapeutic Systems co-founder John Patton worked at
Genentech in the 1980s, he and his colleagues were looking for
alternatives to injection and discovered that the lungs' deepest
tissues readily absorbed insulin's molecules into the bloodstream.
</P>
<P>
   Genentech, a South San Francisco company, decided not to pursue
the concept. In 1990, Patton left Genentech and started Inhale
Therapeutic Systems.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge was to get the insulin delivered deep enough into
the lungs, which can't be done with inhalators like those used for
asthma.
</P>
<P>
   Insulin presents an additional challenge because its molecules
are large and fragile, which makes it difficult to slip past the
natural barriers that protect the lungs from foreign substances,
Chess said.
</P>
<P>
   Inhale Therapeutic Systems developed four primary technologies
to solve the problems:
</P>
<P>
   _ Powder processing, which converts insulin molecules into tiny
particles that are small enough to reach the bottom of the lungs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Glass stabilization, which keeps the powder stable at room
temperature for a year or more, eliminating the need to refrigerate
the insulin.
</P>
<P>
   _ A powder-filling technique for measuring individual doses into
blister packs.
</P>
<P>
   _ A device that can deliver the drug into the lungs.
</P>
<P>
   Working in partnership with New York-based Pfizer Inc. and
Hoechst Marion Roussel of Germany, Inhale Therapeutic Systems has
begun the third and final phase of clinical testing for inhaled
insulin. Trial studies have shown that the device delivers insulin
as effectively as an injection, Chess said.
</P>
<P>
   Inhale Therapeutic Systems has joined with other companies to
develop inhaled delivery for a variety of drugs, including
treatments for multiple sclerosis, osteoporosis, asthma, genetic
emphysema and lung ailments. The company also is seeking partners
to develop inhalable drugs for hepatitis, blood clotting disorders
and infertility, among others.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA already has approved some of the drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Once the inhalable drugs are approved, the drug companies market
them. Inhale Therapeutic Systems will make its money by
manufacturing the powders, supplying the inhalators and receiving
royalties from sales of the drug in inhalable form.

SOMMELIER WITH TASTE FOR BEER DEFIES STUFFY STEREOTYPE

<P>
   CHESTERTOWN, N.Y. _ If Brian Sweeney wasn't so unfailingly
polite, he might get edgy answering questions about his age. He
hears them often enough, almost every night.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you be a wine expert?''
</P>
<P>
   ``How old are you, anyway?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, are you sure you're old enough to drink?''
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney realizes diners at Friends Lake Inn, in the Adirondack
Mountains community of Chestertown, aren't trying to insult him
with these questions. A bundle of energy with a boyish smile, he
is, after all, a mere 29 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the stereotype of a sommelier _ a stuffy,
nose-in-the-air man who took decades to accumulate a wealth of
knowledge about wine _ and it's easy to understand why Sweeney is
the recipient of so many good-natured comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had people ask me in jest if I'm old enough to drink, and
people have asked me where I got my experience,'' he noted.
``Nobody's ever insulting. They're making jokes and I get a good
laugh out of it. The nice thing for me is, people are always
guessing I'm six, seven, eight years younger than I really am.''
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake about it, though: Sweeney knows wine. The
central New Jersey native has completed both the introductory and
advanced courses at the highly regarded Sterling School of Service
&AMP; Hospitality in California's Napa Valley.
</P>
<P>
   This month he continues his formal training with a two-day
program in Hyde Park, put on by the Court of Master Sommeliers,
with his long-range goal to reach master sommelier status. Passing
muster with this London-based organization is akin to being given
the key to the Holy Grail.
</P>
<P>
   There are approximately 100 master sommeliers throughout the
world, and a mere three dozen in the United States. Which means
Brian Sweeney has sipped and savored and spat out an amazing amount
of wine in a relatively short time.
</P>
<P>
   He was not raised to drink wine with dinner, and developed his
keen interest in wine only after graduating from Rider College in
Lawrenceville, N.J. His degree was in finance and he was heading to
Colorado to be a ski bum. He was a beer guy, really. In fact,
Sweeney makes his own beer at home and appreciates a tasty pint.
But while working as a server at a classy steakhouse in Summit
County, Colo., he was introduced to wine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The restaurant had a small wine list, but had some pretty
decent wines on it. The owner wanted the servers to be more
knowledgeable, and he had us attend a wine tasting lunch with
different wines to go with each course,'' Sweeney recalled. ``It
was my first introduction to fine wine and how to pair it up with
food, and I really fell in love with it.''
</P>
<P>
   For the past two years he has been at Friends Lake Inn, and it's
hard to imagine a better place for an oenophile to expand his
knowledge. The inn, off the beaten path in the southern
Adirondacks, has, since it opened 15 years ago, developed a
well-deserved reputation for having an extensive wine list.
</P>
<P>
   Innkeeper Sharon Taylor figures her wine cellar has more than
16,000 bottles featuring about 2,200 varieties, give or take a
couple dozen. The inn's wine list received grand award status from
Wine Spectator magazine in 1997, making it one of 94 eateries in
the world to be so recognized. That year, 339 restaurants submitted
their wine list to the magazine, and only five were selected.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney, familiar with the inn because his parents have a summer
home not far away, met Taylor and was enchanted with the
possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   His wife had just completed training at veterinary school and
found a job nearby. He went to work for Taylor, thinking he might
work all sections of the inn, including the kitchen, with an eye
toward being a general manager. But Sweeney has never made it out
of the wine cellar, so to speak, and within six months was named
sommelier. He is also the inn's cheese expert, or frommagier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brian's terrific,'' Taylor said. ``He's very personable and
does a great job. He really knows wine and he loves wine and I
think our guests appreciate his enthusiasm.''
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney doesn't try to push wine. Each table and each guest is
different, he explained. ``The first question I usually ask is red
or white, as well as what price range they want to be in,'' he
said. ``I try to find out if they're interested in having something
that will pair well with their meal, or if they're looking for wine
that's good on its own. One of the great things about wine is that
it's all individualistic tastes. Everybody's palates are different
and you drink what you enjoy drinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to find what style they are looking for before we get
into subtleties. If I find the guest is getting a little
uncomfortable with the questions, I try to narrow it down in a
hurry. Other people are more than happy to spend five-plus minutes
going through every detail of the wine. It all depends. Every guest
is different.''
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney, who loves all styles of wines, is anything but a wine
snob. And prices don't always denote quality, he believes. Said
Sweeney: ``I've had some awful, awful $300 bottles of wine _
fortunately I didn't have to pay for them. I've also had some
terrific wines from the $10 range.''
</P>

<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He prefers red Burgundies, he admits, after pausing to consider
his many favorites. Hearty-style wines with earthy flavors,
particularly Cote du Nuits varieties from the northern part of
Burgundy.
</P>
<P>
   One of the highlights of his job is sneaking down to the wine
cellar with Taylor's husband, Greg Taylor, after all the guests _
and Sharon _ have called it a night. There, Sweeney and Taylor, a
regional manager for a Manhattan-based fine wine import company,
will spend as much time choosing and debating which bottle to open
as they will actually drinking from it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Brian's palate is really maturing,'' Greg Taylor
observed. ``What happens with a lot of younger wine tasters is that
they like a lot of bigger, bolder wines. Then their palate gets
into more esoteric wines and they start to discern the more finite
differences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brian's moving into that zone where he's discovering little
esoteric flavors, and it's neat to watch.''

THE SULTAN OF SWOOSH SMILES IN THE FACE OF COMPETITION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEVE CAMPBELL  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ Hello, world. Surely you earthlings remember
Tiger Woods. He announced his arrival into professional golf with
enough fanfare to make a royal wedding look like a quickie Las
Vegas ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   And give him credit.
</P>
<P>
   The Sultan of Swoosh hit the ground running so fast, the
competition looked like it had been issued cement shoes. Seasoned
professionals stumbled like amateurs. He won the Masters when he
was 21. By 12 shots. It was the fifth victory _ and only the 18th
start _ of his professional career.
</P>
<P>
   He's 23 now, and the PGA Tour hasn't gotten around to renaming
itself Tigeria. Tiger Woods may still be the biggest name in golf,
but David Duval arrived at Augusta National for the 1999 Masters
with the most serious game.
</P>
<P>
   Duval has rocketed to the No. 1 ranking in the world with four
victories this year. He has won 11 times in his past 34
tournaments. Woods is No. 2. He has won three times since his 1997
Masters victory, which had fellow players wondering aloud about how
to Tiger-proof Augusta National.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cool,'' Woods said. ``No. 2? Actually, it's fine. It's one of
those things that's all cyclical. Everybody's going to have their
runs. David's having his run right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Cool? An all-too-California-cool shrug from the same guy who,
after a runner-up finish in the 10th tournament of his professional
career, groused, ``Second sucks''?
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't that long ago that Earl Woods was boasting that his
son would make more of a mark on the world than Jackie Robinson,
Muhammad Ali, Nelson Mandela and Gandhi. Either Tiger can't stand
to admit how much it galls him to be a distant second to anybody,
or he has learned that he can't possibly live up to the those sorts
of standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does it bother him? Probably, yes,'' said 1998 Masters
champion and Woods confidant Mark O'Meara. ``He wants to be the
man. David wants to be the man. Let's face it: In today's era of
unbelievably talented, deep fields, to win the amount of events
(Duval) has won is phenomenal. So is there a little bit of rivalry
between Tiger and David? Yeah, probably.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods made little secret of his ambition to impose a new world
order on the PGA Tour. He lined up $60 million in endorsements
before he took is first professional swing and starred in an ad
campaign that billed him as a man for all colors and creeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've played a lot of golf with Tiger Woods; I've seen what he
can do,'' O'Meara said. ``In my stints after playing with all the
greats that have played, to me he has got the most talent of any
player I've seen. That doesn't necessarily mean he's going to win
every single tournament. He hasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   In a way, Woods has only himself to blame. His emergence was a
form of shock therapy that jolted his fellow competitors out of any
complacent urges they may have had.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Tiger came out we were faced with the options of
improving if we wanted to compete,'' Duval said, ``or relegating
ourselves to finishing second.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval became a workout warrior, losing 35 pounds. Others headed
for the weight room or began spending more time at the driving
range and the putting greens. Woods still keeps himself in the hunt
more often than not. He just doesn't land his prey as easily as he
did when his competition stood around gawking at his sublime blend
of power and control.
</P>
<P>
   Woods has won once _ at the Buick Invitational _ in eight starts
this year. He has finished second once, third once and fifth twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm actually having more fun,'' Woods said. ``I'm having so
much fun out there that it's actually pretty scary, because I
understand how things work. I understand a lot more about the tour,
about myself. And it's a beautiful thing right now, because I
understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say that I look like I'm not having fun out there
playing because I'm not smiling. Well, I'm focused. I'm trying to
win. And you can't always smile when you're trying to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, being No. 2 doesn't seem so much like stepping in No.
2. Woods insists he is a better, more consistent player than he was
when he won the PGA Tour Player of the Year award in 1997. He
doesn't take so many chances. He is less prone to the double- and
triple-bogeys that have undermined him in majors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you one thing: It's a lot easier to come to
tournaments and not have to do a mandatory press conference every
day,'' Woods said. ``Now David's doing that, and he can have it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Woods couldn't resist immediately adding, ``You know,
people still recognize me the same. It's just because my figure, my
persona, is on different products where people can see it in the
marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods, in other words, wants people to remember he's still the
biggest star in the golfing galaxy. For all of Duval's recent
string of successes, none of them includes a victory in a major.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see Tiger being too far from David Duval right now,''
said Fred Couples, the 1992 Masters winner. ``Pete Sampras has been
No. 1 in tennis for six or seven straight years. If David Duval can
do that, then No. 1 will be a big deal. Tiger Woods can do
anything, you know. David Duval can do anything also.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval is 27 and fresh off of consecutive victories at The
Players Championship and the BellSouth Classic. He is the first
player in a quarter of a century to arrive at Augusta with four
victories for the season already in pocket. His response to the
arrival of the Sultan of Swoosh has been loud and clear.
</P>
<P>
   Hello, world. Now it's Tiger Woods' move.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's playing better, no doubt about it,'' Woods said. ``But I
like my chances, too.''

 &HT;    Awaken your senses: Take a fresh look at seasons
 &HT;    By Betty Parham
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ We are fortunate in America to have access to an
unprecedented variety of food choices. During any season,
supermarkets that are the envy of the world are brimming with a
seemingly endless bounty of produce, and the variety of prepared
and processed selections appears limitless.
</P>
<P>
   There may, however, be a drawback to all this choice and
convenience. With unlimited access to all foods all the time, we
risk losing touch with or at least failing to appreciate the ebb
and flow of the seasons and therefore dull our senses to some of
the richness of life.
</P>
<P>
   The life-affirming and tonic effect of eating locally grown
foods of the season is at risk of being lost, especially among
young people who are increasingly absorbed in technology and whose
diet year-round may consist only of frozen, processed and fast
foods. You know we're in trouble when so many people think that
pink, tasteless circle they find in a fast-food sandwich is
actually a slice of tomato.
</P>
<P>
   One effective way to balance the pace of 21st century life is in
the kitchen. By becoming more aware of what is available at local
markets and at least occasionally preparing family meals with foods
that celebrate and capture the vitality of the season, we can pass
on this increasingly tenuous but basic connection to nature.
</P>
<P>
   Searching the Internet for ``seasonal eating'' produced a wealth
of sites, some with helpful advice on how to incorporate seasonal
cooking into your routine and many with wonderful recipes
incorporating seasonal foods.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  At ``Seasonal Eating Tips,'' 144.92.121.151
</P>
<P>
   /vicdon/tips.htm, you will learn that in 1973, 21 cents of every
food dollar was spent on manufactured foods. In 1987, it was 41
cents. Today it approaches 90 cents. Produced by a farmers market
cooperative, the site also tells us that while seasonal eating
demands more thought, commitment and active participation on the
part of the home cook, the rewards are great. A number of helpful
tips may help you adjust your cooking habits.

   Savory Greens Spread on Bread Rounds

<P>
   Makes 32 pieces Preparation time: 20 minutes Cooking time: about
15 minutes
</P>
<P>
   In southern Sicily one finds tasty and rather thick, doughy
impanatas filled with greens and a multitude of other things,
including raisins, capers, anchovies and cheese. Cookbook author
Paula Wolfert says that when juicy black olives are added, the
result is too heavy. So she developed this recipe using the
ingredients for a spread for bread.
</P>
<P>
   2pounds fresh spinach, escarole or Swiss chard, or a combination
(see note)
</P>
<P>
   Salt to taste
</P>
<P>
   1garlic clove, peeled and lightly crushed
</P>
<P>
   2tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   4flat anchovy fillets, drained and crushed with a fork
</P>
<P>
   1teaspoon salted capers, rinsed and drained
</P>
<P>
   1/4cup chopped pitted purple or black olives (7 or 8 kalamatas)
</P>
<P>
   1tablespoon seedless black or yellow raisins,
</P>
<P>
   soaked in warm water, drained, dried and chopped
</P>
<P>
   1/8teaspoon hot red pepper flakes, or to taste
</P>
<P>
   32grilled or fried rounds ( 1/2 inch thick) of Italian or French
bread
</P>
<P>
   1/3cup coarsely grated Provolone or Caciocavallo cheese,
optional
</P>
<P>
   Wash greens until water runs clear. Remove stems, stalks and any
tough leaves; drain. Cook greens 10 minutes in boiling salted
water; drain, refresh in cold water, drain again and squeeze
thoroughly. (Or cook in microwave: Place in covered dish with a few
tablespoons water and cook on high until tender. Drain thoroughly
and squeeze dry.) Makes 1 cup.
</P>
<P>
   In a small skillet, fry garlic in olive oil until lightly
browned; remove garlic and discard.
</P>
<P>
   Add greens to oil and fry 1 minute, stirring. Add anchovies and
capers and cook, stirring, 30 seconds longer. Remove the mixture to
a work surface. Allow to cool. Add olives, raisins and pepper
flakes and chop fine by hand or in a food processor. Cover and
refrigerate if preparing in advance.
</P>
<P>
   Divide the mixture evenly and pile it onto bread rounds.
Sprinkle them with cheese and run under the broiler to glaze. Serve
warm or at room temperature.
</P>
<P>
   Note: Mix greens or use just one type.
</P>
<P>
   Avoid frozen spinach, which doesn't have enough taste.
</P>
<P>
   Drop greens by handfuls into lots of boiling salted water, then
keep water at full boil throughout.

   Once you have tasted roasted asparagus, you will never want to
eat it any other way. The taste seems to be intensified by the dry
heat of the oven. Shavings of Parmesan cheese are the crowning
glory, but for a less rich variation, they can be omitted.
</P>
<P>
   1bunch asparagus (about 1 pound), rinsed and trimmed
</P>
<P>
   1tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1small piece (about 2 ounces) Parmigiano-Reggiano or Parmesan
cheese, shaved or shredded
</P>
<P>
   Heat oven to 400 degrees. Arrange asparagus in a 13-by-9-inch
baking dish. Drizzle with oil and toss to coat. Bake 12 to 15
minutes or until tender. Remove from the oven. Top with cheese.
Return to oven and bake just until cheese melts, about 5 minutes.

 &HT;    A springtime menu worthy of Monet puts accent on fresh
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Perhaps it was all that free-flowing creativity. Or
maybe it was the mere matter of wanting to enjoy the success he'd
long fought for. But Monet had a predilection for overindulgence.
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, makes a masterful host. When it came to food,
Monet would spare no expense, though often what he needed could be
found on his estate or in his kitchen garden. The key to his food
was fine, fresh ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   We perused ``Monet's Table: The Cooking Journals of Claude
Monet'' for a spring menu and found some gems, starting with
stuffed onions that will be a great way to showcase spring
Vidalias.
</P>
<P>
   Then we suggest mussels with fresh herbs, followed by a main
course of steak marinated in mustard and roasted wild mushrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Serve with a salad of greens dressed with an olive oil and white
wine vinaigrette, and if you want to mimic Monet, add heavy doses
of salt and pepper. For the finale, the famous apple tart.
</P>
<P>
   While we know Monet always entertained at lunch, we also know
that few of us have such an opportunity these days. The menu we
present here would work well as either lunch or dinner, with some
adjustment to portion sizes (4-ounce steaks at lunch instead of
8-ounce, perhaps). All the recipes can be doubled.
</P>
<P>
   Monet had a staff. Most of us don't. So remember to work into
your entertaining plan the fact that the mussels and the steak need
to be prepared shortly before serving. When I tested this menu, I
bedecked my kitchen table with lovely flowers and served the first
two courses there. That way I could cook and visit with my guests
at the same time. We moved into the dining room for the main course
and dessert. In warmer weather, I'd serve the whole thing on my
screened porch _ in keeping with Monet's penchant for dining
outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   SIDE DISH OR APPETIZER
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte Lyses' Stuffed White Onions
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 servings Preparation time: 45 minutes Cooking time: 30
minutes
</P>
<P>
   Monet loved getting recipes from friends, as is the case with
these onions, which came from Charlotte Lyses, a very popular
actress in Monet's time. These will be divine with spring Vidalias
and a nice new version to add to your favorite ways to stuff the
Georgia orbs. I roasted chicken livers in a shallow roasting pan,
then finely chopped them; for the herbs, I used dried thyme and
oregano. If the mixture is a little stiff, add a dab of Dijon
mustard.
</P>
<P>
   4 large white onions
</P>
<P>
   1 cup ground cooked roast pork, chicken or calf liver
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons chopped chives
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons dried mixed herbs
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup grated Gruyere cheese, divided
</P>
<P>
   1 hard-cooked egg
</P>
<P>
   Cut 1/2 inch off the tops of the onions. Blanch the onions by
putting them in boiling water to cover and cooking for 30 minutes.
Drain and cool. (Or put onions in a microwavable dish and cook for
7-10 minutes, until soft.)
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Scoop out the center of each onion,
leaving about a 1/2-inch wall. Combine the ground cooked meat with
the chives, dried mixed herbs and half the grated cheese. Mash the
egg yolk and chop the white; combine with the rest of the mixture.
Stuff the onions with the mixture, mounding it slightly. Place
stuffed onions in a greased roasting pan and sprinkle with the rest
of the grated Gruyere cheese. Bake 30 minutes or until cheese is
lightly browned.

   APPETIZER
</P>
<P>
   Mussels With Fresh Herbs
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 servings Preparation time: 20 minutes Cooking time:
15-18 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Monet loved cooking seasonally, so feel free to use fresh herbs
that are most available to flavor the mussels. Chervil is coming
into season, but if you can't find it, use the feathery tops of
fennel. Sorrel also is available in the spring, but you can
substitute the juice of one lemon. If you want to serve this as an
appetizer or second course, you can get by with three dozen.
</P>
<P>
   48 large mussels (about 5 pints)
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided
</P>
<P>
   2 onions, coarsely chopped
</P>
<P>
   4 sprigs parsley
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon coarse salt
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon black pepper
</P>
<P>
   2 ribs celery
</P>
<P>
   1 cup chervil
</P>
<P>
   4 cups sorrel
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup chopped parsley
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons chopped tarragon
</P>
<P>
   1 cup dry white wine
</P>
<P>
   1 cup broth
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon cornstarch, sifted
</P>
<P>
   Wash the mussels well in lots of cold water. Discard any that
are not tightly closed or that are broken. Put them in a deep pot
with half the butter and with the onion, parsley sprigs, salt,
pepper and celery. Cover and cook over high heat for about 10
minutes, shaking the pot vigorously from time to time, until the
shells open. Discard any that are still closed. Drain the mussels
in a colander, reserving the cooking liquid.
</P>
<P>
   In a skillet, melt the rest of the butter and add the chervil,
sorrel, chopped parsley and tarragon. Add the cooking liquid from
the mussels and the wine. Add the broth and cornstarch, stirring
until smooth. Reheat the mussels in the sauce. If desired, the
mussels may be shelled before serving.

   Monet's Recipe for Cepes
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 servings Preparation time: 15 minutes Cooking time: 40
minutes
</P>
<P>
   Though Monet loved food and collecting recipes, this is the only
one that in his journals he claims to be truly his own. The artist
absolutely loved wild mushrooms and would organize hunts,
especially for morels. You can select among the many varieties of
mushrooms available now in grocery stores to make your mixture.
Most of us are used to sauteing mushrooms, but here they are
roasted, which complements the woody flavors.
</P>
<P>
   1 pound cepes (wild mushrooms)
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2 garlic cloves, minced
</P>
<P>
   4 sprigs parsley, chopped
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon pepper
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Wipe and gently clean the cepes.
Discard the tip of the stem and chop the stems finely with a knife,
leaving the caps whole. (Or you may choose to simply cook the
mushrooms whole.) Arrange the stems in a shallow ovenproof dish and
lay the caps on top of them. Sprinkle with the olive oil. Bake for
20 minutes, or until the oil is transparent.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the garlic and parsley. Remove the cepes from the oven
and sprinkle the garlic mixture over them. Season with salt and
pepper. Bake for another 20 minutes, basting at least twice with
the liquid in the dish.

<P>
   Preparation time: 5 minutes Standing time: 2 hours Cooking time:
7-10 minutes
</P>
<P>
   This is a beautifully simple recipe that can be multiplied by
the number of guests. If you are planning a luncheon, you may want
to go with smaller cuts, about 4 ounces. I used a smooth Dijon
mustard, which created a thin crust when cooked in an iron skillet.
</P>
<P>
   1 filet steak (about 8 ounces)
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons Dijon mustard
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   Spread both sides of the steak with the mustard, and let stand 2
hours. Melt butter in a skillet or steak pan and saute the steak on
both sides.

   DESSERT
</P>
<P>
   Tarte Tatin (Apple Tart)

   Makes 8 servings
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 20 minutes Resting time: 1 hour Cooking time:
45 minutes
</P>
<P>
   This now-famous recipe was developed by the sisters Tatin, who
owned an inn not far from Giverny, and Monet reportedly loved to
visit and partake of this simple but elegant apple tart. This is
far less sweet than some apple pies and tarts, but the pure flavors
are a delight, especially with a scoop of vanilla or caramel ice
cream.
</P>
<P>
   2 cups all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   5 tablespoons confectioners' sugar, divided
</P>
<P>
   1/8 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1 egg yolk
</P>
<P>
   Water
</P>
<P>
   1 cup unsalted butter, cut in pieces
</P>
<P>
   6 small apples, peeled and sliced
</P>
<P>
   Pour the flour into a bowl, make a well in the center and into
it put half the sugar, the salt, egg yolk and 1/2 cup warm water.
Mix well. Add half the butter pieces. Mix the dough until smooth,
then roll it out into a rectangle. Fold up the rectangle by folding
one-third toward the center, then folding the remaining third over
the top of the folded part. Cover with a damp cloth and let it rest
for 1 hour. Roll out the dough again into a circle 1/4 inch thick.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Arrange apple slices in a deep pie
dish. Add the rest of the butter pieces and sprinkle with the rest
of the confectioners' sugar. Cover with the dough. Bake for 45
minutes. Turn the tart out onto a plate so that the apples are on
top.

 &HT;    Menu by Monet: Painter's passion for gardens is recorded not
only on canvas but in a book that celebrates the artist's love of
food
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For artist Claude Monet, the garden was a fertile
source of inspiration. He rose early each day to capture such
subtle moments as the lavender light of dawn caressing the
waterlilies in the pond.
</P>
<P>
   And he worked late in the afternoon to record with his oil
paints how the afternoon sun colored the blossoms of the plum
trees.
</P>
<P>
   But Monet found more than inspiration for his canvas from the
garden; he found inspiration for his kitchen as well. And as the
artist became more successful, his penchant for entertaining fellow
artists and friends with the finest seasonal foods flourished.
</P>
<P>
   Menus, recipes and photographs from such celebrations have been
preserved in ``Monet's Table: The Cooking Journals of Claude
Monet'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $34.50), which has been restocked in
many area bookstores in conjunction with a 60-painting exhibit of
impressionist works at the High Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   Eight Monet paintings, including ``Plum Trees in Blossom''
(1879), are included in the exhibit, which will be at the High
until May 16. Art lovers can dine on a Monet-inspired luncheon menu
at Park 75, at the Four Seasons Hotel just around the corner from
the High. Or to truly experience a slice of life from Monet's
fabled French estate, re-create a Monet meal at home with the menu
we provide inside _ ideal for a spring luncheon or dinner party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monet's Table'' includes a warm and detailed text written by
Claire Joyes, wife of the great-grandson of Alice Monet (Monet's
second wife), which reveals much about the setting of his
special-occasion meals as well as the guests. And Joyes worked with
famed French chef Joel Robuchon to research and test some 160
recipes from the artist's cooking journals.
</P>
<P>
   Joyes' research shows Monet's cuisine was heavily inspired by
his kitchen garden, which during his years at the now-legendary
house at Giverny was actually located on the other side of the
village from his estate.
</P>
<P>
   The 2 1/2-acre walled kitchen garden, unlike the softer flower
and water gardens at his home, was laid out in straight lines, with
rows of cabbages, brussels sprouts, lettuces, lima beans, tomatoes,
artichokes, chile peppers, pearl onions and many other vegetables.
There were also pear, apple, cherry and plum trees, and herbs such
as sage, oregano, sorrel, chervil and tarragon.
</P>
<P>
   Monet bought seeds and plants everywhere he went, and he also
collected recipes. After one of his trips to London, his cook,
Marguerite, had to learn to make Yorkshire pudding as served at the
Savoy Hotel. The recipe in ``Monet's Table'' for Tarte Tatin
actually comes from the sisters Tatin. They owned a nearby inn that
Monet visited frequently to sample the famous dish.
</P>
<P>
   Monet himself did not cook but had a cook, a servant and a
number of gardeners. His staff grew with his notoriety,
particularly the gardening staff.
</P>
<P>
   Life at Giverny, where he lived with Alice, her six children and
his two children, was very regimented, Joyes' research shows. Monet
rose before dawn, often to a breakfast of eggs, bacon, grilled
tripe sausages, Dutch or Stilton cheese, toast with orange
marmalade and tea _ all customs he picked up in his travels to
England and the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   He would work throughout the morning, until the gong sounded at
11:30, signaling lunch. As the key meal of the day, lunch would
include a hot first course, a meat and/or fish, a highly peppered
salad, a vegetable and a dessert.
</P>
<P>
   Among Monet's favorites were mushrooms and chicory, woodcocks
and wild game, duck and guinea fowl, pike and turbot. He loved
fruit desserts and a dense pistachio cake.
</P>
<P>
   Monet would work again in his studio throughout the afternoon,
breaking for a light meal at the end of the day, often with soup
and an egg dish, and retiring at 9:30 p.m. to rise early again the
next day.
</P>
<P>
   But routine frequently gave way to celebrations, especially for
luncheons or picnics with friends _ events that reflected his love
of food and finery. At least three of his paintings had luncheon
themes and titles. Because his cooking journals didn't include
everyday menus, Joyes' research actually reveals more about such
special occasions.
</P>
<P>
   An invitation to lunch at Giverny was coveted among his friends.
Frequent guests included art dealers and patrons, statesmen like
Clemenceau and fellow impressionists such as Renoir, Pissarro,
Degas and Cezanne. Because of his early bedtime, Monet never
entertained in the evening.
</P>
<P>
   Guests would arrive midmorning and visit the studio and the
greenhouses, and then sit down to a lavish lunch, always served on
a table covered with a yellow tablecloth with either blue Creil
earthenware in the pattern Japon or, on the most special occasions,
white porcelain dishes with a wide yellow border and blue edging.
Centerpieces consisted of little bouquets of flowers from the
garden or the greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
   After lunch, guests could tour the grounds, stopping for
afternoon tea and cakes under the lime trees. When the weather was
nice, it wasn't unusual for Monet to order a whole feast packed up
for picnics, at times big affairs with china and tables, at others
little more than pate and fruit on a blanket.
</P>
<P>
   Inside this section is a menu for a special meal, beginning with
a recipe for stuffed onions that would make wonderful use of spring
Vidalias and ending with the famous Tarte Tatin. Borrow a few of
Monet's entertaining ideas and set out china and small bouquets. An
invitation to your house may be as coveted as one to Giverny.

   WASHINGTON _ New images of American life color the walls of the
Smithsonian Institution: photographs of astronauts, doctors, altar
boys, fishermen, White House staffers, soccer players and
ballerinas.
</P>
<P>
   All Hispanic-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what we are. We're black. We're white. We're brown.
We're Asian. We're mixed. We're Catholic. We're Jew. We're
Protestant. We are everything that everyone is,'' said actor Edward
James Olmos, who developed a multimedia project documenting the
diverse experience of the nation's Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   The photographic exhibit _ ``Americanos: Latino Life in the
United States'' _ opened Wednesday at the Smithsonian's National
Museum of American History.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit, which includes 120 photographs organized around
themes such as family, community, education and sports, will become
the largest traveling photo exhibit in the history of the museum.
</P>
<P>
   After September, it will travel to the Museum of the City of New
York and to the Eiteljorg Museum in Indianapolis early next year.
It is already booked through 2003, including stops in San Antonio
in May 2000 and Houston in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an honor and a real privilege to be standing here in the
Smithsonian Institution in this manner ... almost unbelievable,''
Olmos said at a news conference. Holding up a book of pictures from
the exhibit, he went from page to page, stating repeatedly, ``This
is an American.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These are images of people that have been here since the
existence of the human species in the Western Hemisphere,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Olmos said the exhibit is of major importance because Hispanics
are under-represented in the history, media and arts of American
culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``For this to be the very first exhibit of its kind to get to
this level is a disaster. We are not talking about 1899, we're
talking about 1999,'' he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The work of 30 photographers includes powerful portraits such as
the one of Bernadine Mendoza, wearing a Gap T-shirt and a gold
cross, sewing a new American flag in a Houston factory.
</P>
<P>
   Others, non-political but still dramatic, capture warm and
intriguing moments such as a bespectacled 8-year-old Carolina
Bernal gazing seriously at a chess board in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Olmos plans to visit San Antonio and Houston this month to
promote other parts of the multimedia project, including:
</P>
<P>
   _ A book of photographs from the exhibit published by Little,
Brown and Co. The book includes an introduction by Carlos Fuentes,
considered Mexico's leading novelist.
</P>
<P>
   _ A television documentary that will debut on HBO this fall. It
features a series of short profiles of American Hispanics,
including the San Diego writers and performers known as the Taco
Shop Poets and a Mexican-born agent of the U.S. Border Patrol who
apprehends illegal aliens for a living.
</P>
<P>
   _ The release of a CD of Latin artists representing a wide range
of music, including the tejano sounds of Flaco Jimenez, the classic
salsa of Celia Cruz and the Latin jazz of Tito Puente.

PANEL APPROVES PLAN FOR USE OF RECLUSE'S FORTUNE

 By ERIC BRAZIL  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The $5.1 million estate bequeathed to the city
by a reclusive Polish immigrant will create a perpetual fund for
aiding the poor and elderly under a plan approved by a committee of
the San Francisco Board of Supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   Human Services Department General Manager Will Lightbourne said
he expects that Zygmunt Arendt's dying wishes will be realized
sometime this summer. Implementation of the plan is contingent on
its approval by Judge Lawrence Kay, who is overseeing the estate.
</P>
<P>
   Arendt died at 92 on Jan. 24, 1998, leaving a handwritten will
giving his entire estate to San Francisco, with the mayor and
supervisors as his executors.
</P>
<P>
   The retired railroad car inspector had lived frugally in a
sparsely furnished home in the city's Bernal Heights section. In
his old age, he got around in a wheelchair and subsisted on a diet
of tuna, bananas and sardines.
</P>
<P>
   But an examination of his estate disclosed that he had been an
exceedingly canny investor in the stock market. Near the end of his
life, his portfolio was yielding dividends of $20,000 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of Arendt's will, 60 percent of his estate is to
go to poor and needy individuals, and 40 percent to disadvantaged
seniors and disabled children.
</P>
<P>
   The spending proposal offered by the city Department of Human
Services would preserve the capital of Arendt's estate in a trust
fund and use the interest earned on the money to benefit the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Lightbourne estimated that the estate will earn $250,000 to
$500,000 in interest each year.
</P>
<P>
   The 60 percent share will be distributed to poor people seeking
work through the Personal Assisted Employment Services program. The
Arendt money will be used to help them pay for non-emergency
services such as eye care and dental care.
</P>
<P>
   The 40 percent share will go to organizations working with the
disadvantaged elderly and disabled children.
</P>
<P>
   Recipients will be selected by a board of trustees made up of
volunteers chosen by city officials.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, approved unanimously by the Audit and Government
Efficiency Committee of the Board of Supervisors, must next be
approved by the full board.

   SEATTLE _ Parkinson's disease is a cruel magician. It makes its
victims slowly disappear.
</P>
<P>
   It mutes their voices, erases their expressions, robs them of
their motor control. Finally, they freeze in a kind of suspended
animation, disappearing behind the blank stare of the ``Parkinson's
mask.''
</P>
<P>
   Although more people have Parkinson's than multiple sclerosis,
Lou Gehrig's disease and muscular dystrophy combined, the disease
has escaped much public notice and research funding.
</P>
<P>
   It is a disease that renders its victims invisible, trapping
them inside their houses, inside their bodies, inside their minds,
until they simply vanish to the rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parkinson's has been called the silent epidemic,'' said Dr.
Donald Calne, a neurologist at the University of British Columbia
in Vancouver. And it's a growing one.
</P>
<P>
   But researchers are optimistic. Breakthroughs are on the horizon
that they hope will not only help Parkinson's patients, but also
will advance the understanding of other degenerative brain
diseases. New drugs and new kinds of surgery that could
dramatically improve quality of life are becoming available.
</P>
<P>
   Once thought of exclusively as an ``old person's disease,''
Parkinson's is increasingly affecting younger people.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists aren't sure why. Possibly, greater awareness of
symptoms has led to earlier diagnosis. But it may be something more
sinister.
</P>
<P>
   Parkinson's is caused by a shortage of a chemical messenger in
the brain. Dopamine, a key neurotransmitter involved in motor
control, allows us to translate the will to move into action. What
causes brain cells to die and stop producing dopamine, however,
remains a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists suspect that the disease is caused by a complex
interaction between genes and the environment. Environmental toxins
play a role in triggering the disease, although no one knows which
toxins, or why they trigger the disease in some people and not
others.
</P>
<P>
   Many believe that until those answers are clear, the incidence
of Parkinson's is bound to increase.
</P>
<P>
   Calne, who has tracked Parkinson's patients for more than three
decades, has already seen a fourfold increase in younger patients.
</P>
<P>
   Although the average age of onset is about 57, 10 percent to 15
percent of patients show symptoms before 40.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 1 million people _ 1 percent to 2 percent of people
older than 60 _ have Parkinson's disease, a number that is expected
to swell as baby boomers age.
</P>
<P>
   And it could get much worse. Some experts call Parkinson's the
``iceberg disease.''
</P>
<P>
   Autopsy findings show that for every patient with overt symptoms
of Parkinson's, 10 or 20 more show traces of the brain damage
associated with the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its prevalence, Parkinson's hasn't had the visibility of
illnesses such as AIDS or cancer, partly because patients haven't
mobilized to raise money or awareness.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to get Parkinson's patients to take action, said
Dennis Wright, 46, who was diagnosed four years ago. Parkinson's
patients can't turn their own thoughts into actions, let alone act
on the thoughts of others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not responding is pretty natural in this group,'' he said.
Wright has lobbied in Washington, D.C., as well as Olympia, Wash.,
to raise funds to fight the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still way behind on per-patient spending compared to
other diseases,'' Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   Parkinson's affects about as many patients as HIV and AIDS, for
example, but the National Institutes of Health last year spent $41
in research per Parkinson's patient, compared with $1,640 per
patient with HIV or AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Now more and more Parkinson's patients, especially younger ones,
are speaking out about the need for more funding in the hopes of
finding a cure. A Parkinson's cure also could yield new approaches
to treating other brain diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Lou
Gehrig's disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many possible cures coming from so many different
directions,'' Wright said. ``People always say a cure is 15 years
away, but my goal is to get that to five years, or three years
even.''
</P>
<P>
   OIL FOR THE TIN MAN:
</P>
<P>
   A cure has already come tantalizingly close.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James Parkinson first described the mysterious ``shaking
palsy'' in 1817. Although references to Parkinson's symptoms date
to Chinese and Indian medical texts more than 2,500 years ago,
Parkinson was the first to recognize that many paradoxical symptoms
were related to the same disease.
</P>
<P>
   The symptoms included stiffness and tremors, rigid
immobilization and a sudden unlocking of activity. Patients might
sit for hours with an unblinking stare, or suddenly scoot off in a
frenzy of tiny, accelerating steps, a stuttering gait that gave
them a Chaplinesque quality. Apparently paralyzed, many patients
were nonetheless capable of surprising reflexive action, such as
running out of a house on fire, or jumping in a river to save a
drowning victim.
</P>
<P>
   It was as though some internal on-off toggle switch was
malfunctioning.
</P>
<P>
   It took 150 more years for scientists to figure out that the
toggle switch was dopamine, which is vital for relaying motor
signals in the brain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dopamine is like oil for the tin man,'' said Bill Bell of
Seattle, whose mother, stepfather, godfather and another relative
all live with the disease. Dopamine is what keeps people moving
smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   That discovery led to the first treatment for Parkinson's:
levodopa. L-dopa, made famous in Oliver Sacks' book ``Awakenings,''
is converted to dopamine by nerve cells in the brain.
</P>
<P>
   L-dopa miraculously roused Parkinson's patients _ even some who
had been frozen for decades _ but the ``cure'' was short-lived. As
Parkinson's progresses, there are fewer neurons to convert L-dopa
to dopamine, and the drug's efficacy wears off.
</P>
<P>
   Parkinson's symptoms occur when dopamine-producing neurons in
the substantia nigra of the brain begin to die. In the exotic
geography of the brain, the substantia nigra is a thumbnail-size
structure at the top of the brain stem in one of the most primitive
and evolutionarily ancient parts of the brain.
</P>
<P>
   The neurons of the substantia nigra communicate with the basal
ganglia _ a constellation of neuron-dense structures buried deep in
the cerebral hemispheres.
</P>
<P>
   The basal ganglia provide a critical feedback loop that governs
motor control, modulating information as it flows between the
cerebral cortex, where complex movements originate as thoughts, and
the spinal cord, where those thoughts are translated into action.
Dopamine makes this loop work, giving people control over their
voluntary movement.
</P>
<P>
   By the time symptoms appear in most patients, the brain has
already lost 80 percent of its ability to make dopamine.
</P>
<P>
   Without dopamine, the nerve cells can't tell which signals are
important to relay, said Richard Palmiter, a professor of
biochemistry at the University of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suppose you're driving at night and you see hundreds of
lights, but you can't figure out that the red and green lights are
the important ones to pay attention to,'' he said. ``Somehow,
you've got to be able to focus on the right lights, or you'll make
the wrong decision when driving.''
</P>
<P>
   Dopamine helps direct the nerve cell traffic.
</P>
<P>
   THE SEARCH FOR CLUES:
</P>
<P>
   Although researchers don't know what causes neurons in the
substantia nigra to die, they suspect genetic susceptibility and
environmental toxins both play a role.
</P>
<P>
   A landmark study published recently in the Journal of the
American Medical Association, for example, showed that the
identical twins of Parkinson's patients are no more likely overall
to get the disease than non-identical siblings, indicating that
genes play a limited role. (There was evidence that genetics play a
stronger role in patients who show symptoms before age 50.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Parkinson's is thought to be caused by the combination of
aging, genetic predisposition and environmental factors,'' said Dr.
Ali Samii, a neurologist and movement disorder specialist at
Harborview Medical Center here.
</P>
<P>
   Except in rare cases, the disease doesn't run in families. But
about 15 percent of patients have a close relative with
Parkinson's, which points to a complicated interplay between
environment and genes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think something quite transient might set (the disease) in
motion,'' Calne said. ``That's the simplest explanation. Some
(environmental factor) kills some cells immediately and damages
others.''
</P>
<P>
   An environmental trigger could alter the programming of the
cells so they die over time, eventually depleting the dopamine
supply.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rough epidemiological studies have linked higher incidence of
Parkinson's in areas of high industry, or where there is lots of
chemical usage,'' said Dr. Phil Ballard, director of the Movement
Disorder Center at Swedish Medical Center. ``Some studies have
linked it to well water as well, but so far no one has been able to
identify any one specific thing.''
</P>
<P>
   TREATMENT HORIZONS:
</P>
<P>
   While scientists continue to search for the trigger, they also
are devising new ways to treat Parkinson's.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's exciting about Parkinson's is that the knowledge about
the mechanism underlying nerve cell degeneration and regeneration
is just exploding,'' Ballard said.
</P>
<P>
   Many scientists believe that Parkinson's research will yield the
big breakthrough that will allow them to someday reverse many kinds
of degenerative brain diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Work already is under way on new classes of drugs, including
some that doctors hope will be neuroprotective _ preventing the
nerve cells from dying in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a rather exciting time,'' Calne said. ``In the course
of the last two years, five new drugs for Parkinson's have come on
the market, compared with about one every five years previously.''
</P>
<P>
   Three of the new drugs mimic the action of dopamine, and two
block the breakdown of dopamine so that the brain's supply doesn't
dwindle as quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Some researchers are looking at ways to stimulate the brain to
make new neurons, something thought impossible a few years ago,
Ballard said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, new surgical techniques show promise for better
symptom control, especially for tremors.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Sean Grady, a neurosurgeon at Harborview, and Dr. Diana
Kraemer at Swedish are doing ``deep brain stimulation,'' which
involves threading a delicate electrode into the thalamus, one of
the structures of the basal ganglia. The electrode is attached to a
pacemaker-like device implanted in the patient's chest. The patient
activates the device by passing a magnet over his skin. The device
then delivers a mild electrical current that essentially ``turns
off'' the tremor by blocking nerve cells that are misfiring in the
brain.
</P>
<P>
   The device can be ``tuned'' up or down, depending on the
tremors' severity, and generally creates fewer side effects than
traditional surgery for tremors. It also is reversible. Surgeons
can remove the electrode, leaving the brain tissue intact. In the
traditional approach, surgeons burn small lesions in the brain,
permanently destroying tissue, Grady said.
</P>
<P>
   As techniques improve, scientists also are experimenting with
threading the electrodes into an even smaller part of the brain _
the subthalamic region _ which they think could control even more
Parkinson's symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   There are even more futuristic therapies on the horizon.
Scientists now believe that fetal cells implanted in the brain can
replace the missing dopamine. For such implants to become
widespread, however, researchers must develop a cell line that can
be cultured in the lab and produced in large quantities.
</P>
<P>
   Even more enticing is the lure of gene therapy.
</P>
<P>
   The UW's Palmiter recently demonstrated a technique for
introducing new genes into the brain cells of mice, which could
lead to gene therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Palmiter used a modified virus to introduce a gene that caused
mice with Parkinson's-like symptoms to make more dopamine. Viruses,
which are nature's genetic engineers, can insert themselves into
the DNA of host cells.
</P>
<P>
   The trick is to find the right gene to put into human brain
cells, Palmiter said. Researchers are looking for a gene that would
protect the cells in the substantia nigra from being destroyed by
Parkinson's.
</P>
<P>
   To find such a gene, however, scientists need to understand how
the cellular machinery breaks down in the first place. This is the
holy grail of brain research. Scientists now think there may be a
common mechanism that causes cell death in patients with
Alzheimer's, Lou Gehrig's disease, Progressive Supranuclear Palsy
and other neurodegenerative brain disorders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alzheimer's and Parkinson's _ they have common threads running
through them,'' Calne said. ``If patients live long enough with
Alzheimer's, they will develop some symptoms of Parkinson's and
vice versa.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers hope unlocking the secret to Parkinson's will help
unlock the secret to all the degenerative brain diseases.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have pieces of information,'' Ballard said. ``It's like a
picture developing in a (darkroom) pan. The picture is just
starting to get to where you can tell what it is.''

SCIENTIST FIGHTS DISEASE AT WORK -- AND IN LIFE 
</HEADLINE>

 By CAROL SMITH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Paul Gladstone understands at a more intimate level
than most the anatomy of the damaged brain.
</P>
<P>
   As a scientist, he is on working terms with the intricate
molecular pathways in the brain. He can describe what happens when
neurons die and neurotransmitters disappear. He details which
circuits get disrupted, which loops of neural programming get
erased.
</P>
<P>
   As a patient, he lives with the consequences.
</P>
<P>
   On this particular day, Gladstone, 51, is hunched over his
kitchen table contemplating the links between the immune system and
the central nervous system, two areas of particular scientific
interest to him.
</P>
<P>
   He speaks rapidly in a soft, breathy voice, barely audible at
times. His words tumble over each other, the sentences speeding
away from him like eager dogs let out on a trail. He pauses
frequently, as if to call back his thoughts, before his words take
off again. It's a curious, involuntary acceleration of speech.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a symptom of Parkinson's disease.
</P>
<P>
   There are other signs as well. His body has a strangely restless
quality, as though he were responding to a cacophony of nervous
impulses. His foot rocks with a constant tremor. His hands shake.
When he crosses the room, his gait is unsteady, his balance
tenuous. He still has a yellowing bruise on one cheekbone from a
recent spill.
</P>
<P>
   It's a particularly cruel turn for Gladstone, whose second love
is the stage. A former actor with an improv group, it's as though
his body now improvises without him.
</P>
<P>
   Diagnosed at 38, Gladstone is one of the growing number of
younger people with Parkinson's, a disease that attacks the brain's
main motor signal pathways. Relentless and progressive, it
eventually disconnects the mind and body so patients lose the
ability to initiate or control movement.
</P>
<P>
   Effortless movement is, by definition, something most of us
don't think much about. When we walk, we don't have to will our
arms to swing in opposition to our steps. When we're amused, we
laugh without considering how to arrange our facial muscles to
convey our emotion.
</P>
<P>
   For Parkinson's patients, however, that autopilot function is
turned off. Controlling movement requires intense concentration and
exertion.
</P>
<P>
   Although no two people with Parkinson's exhibit symptoms exactly
the same way, the most recognizable signs are a tremor in the hands
and feet, rigidity and a stooped posture.
</P>
<P>
   The disease leads to a profound poverty of movement that robs
patients of gesture and expression. Their faces take on an
unblinking, masklike look; they take short, shuffling steps; their
arms don't swing. They may slow to the point of freezing. With no
balance reflexes, they frequently fall. About 30 percent of
patients eventually suffer some cognitive impairment, ranging from
memory lapse to dementia.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists know the disorder stems from a shortage of dopamine,
a chemical messenger necessary for the smooth transmission of motor
signals. And they know the shortage is caused by the death of the
main dopamine-producing neurons in the brain. They can even
pinpoint where in the brain the cells begin to die.
</P>
<P>
   But they don't know what causes the neurons to die.
</P>
<P>
   Treatment, vastly improved in recent years, means many patients
can live for years with relative control of their symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, there is no stopping it _ at least not yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the second most common degenerative disorder after
Alzheimer's,'' said Dr. Sean Grady, a neurosurgeon at Harborview
Medical Center and professor at the University of Washington.
``Everyone knows someone with Parkinson's.''
</P>
<P>
   Gladstone first suspected something was wrong when one arm
didn't swing correctly when he went jogging. He had other subtle
symptoms as well _ a puzzling slowing of his movements, a
breathiness that stole into his voice.
</P>
<P>
   A research immunologist, Gladstone's scientific intuition told
him something wasn't working right.
</P>
<P>
   It would be two years before his diagnosis, however, because few
doctors thought to consider Parkinson's in someone so young.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctors couldn't see my symptoms, but they believed me,''
he said. ``They just couldn't tell me what was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no blood test or laboratory test for Parkinson's. Only
an autopsy can lead to a definitive diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   Like detectives, pathologists dust for fingerprints of the
disease on the brain. In Parkinson's patients, slides of brain
tissue show distinctive granules of dark matter called Lewy bodies
strewn throughout the area damaged by the disease.
</P>
<P>
   These dark clumps appear to be related to the breakdown of the
neurons, said Dr. Donald Calne, a neurologist at the University of
British Columbia in Vancouver and a Parkinson's expert. They may be
made of cellular refuse, the miscellaneous building blocks in the
structure of the cell.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're like little bags of bones,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For the living, there is no such telltale evidence. In the
absence of lab tests, doctors must deduce Parkinson's from its
symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated by a lack of answers, Gladstone finally went to the
Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., where a doctor recognized the
Parkinsonian quality of his voice and speech patterns.
</P>
<P>
   It was almost worse knowing. ``I have a very high tolerance for
ambiguity,'' he said. ``It's easier to deny something that doesn't
have a name.''
</P>
<P>
   For about six years after the diagnosis, Gladstone hid the
disease from colleagues, not wanting to lose his place in the
fast-paced, ultra-competitive world of medical research.
</P>
<P>
   Then a senior scientist with Bristol-Meyers Squibb Co., he was
studying the regulation of the immune system at the cellular level.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was afraid they would take me less seriously,'' said
Gladstone, who earned his doctorate in genetics from Harvard
University and worked for a time as a researcher at the University
of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   As the disease progressed, however, it became more difficult to
hide _ and not just from colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Separated from his wife, he has an 8-year-old daughter,
Danielle, who spends two nights a week with him. Danielle learned
at an early age the nuances of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since I've been alive, my Dad has had it,'' she said. It means
she must help him around the house and explain to friends why her
Dad seems different sometimes.
</P>
<P>
   When his medication starts wearing off, for example, Gladstone's
face begins to freeze. She tells friends: ``Poppy doesn't smile
when he gets stiff.''
</P>
<P>
   She is nonchalant about occasionally having to help her Dad up
when he falls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most kids don't have to worry about doing stuff like that at
such a young age,'' she said. ``It makes you so that you recognize
things when people need your help.''
</P>
<P>
   As his motor control became more erratic, Gladstone eventually
had to let go of his bench work in the lab. He stopped working
full-time about a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't do the fine-motor work anymore,'' he said. But his
mind is still a working laboratory. He reads constantly and
communicates with researchers all over the country, looking for new
ideas about the disease.
</P>
<P>
   He's also in demand as a consultant, brainstorming with
colleagues and ferreting out new directions for research.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul was always an extraordinarily creative thinker,'' said
Jerry Nepom, director of Virginia Mason Research Center, during one
such session recently.
</P>
<P>
   Others try to think outside the box, he said. ``There is no box
for Paul.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, however, having Parkinson's has changed how
Gladstone approaches scientific questions.
</P>
<P>
   He knows the forces that drive ``big science.'' He knows how
easy it is to forget about the patients behind the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before I got sick, I didn't think: This is about sick people,
people who need help,'' he said of his days in the lab. ``I have
very different criteria for judging research now. So much federally
funded research has so much to do with its own internal logic, and
so little to do with patients. I wish there were a patient on every
institute panel _ a group of people, patients, asking: `What will
this (study) do for the patient?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Gladstone hopes that will happen someday. In the meantime, he
focuses on not letting Parkinson's take over his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having Parkinson's has meant losing so much of what
characterized me as a person _ my work, my energy, my acting, my
relationship with my daughter,'' he said. ``No area of my life is
unspared.''
</P>
<P>
   But he refuses to give in to the disease, and he continues to
search for answers.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledges that having a scientist for a patient has been a
challenge for his doctor.
</P>
<P>
   ``She tells me to just back off and take my pills and be a
patient, but I can't,'' he said. ``That's not me. I'm always trying
to figure out another way.''

   KOSOVO-LOGO (Undated) _ Even wars have logos these days, at
least on television, and the coverage of the Kosovo war invariably
features the Albanian eagle, splashed across the screen like the
NBC peacock. The Albanian eagle, angular, Gothic, almost medieval
in style, with its two heads and dragonlike claws, seems to sum up
the ancient nature of the conflicts in the Balkans _ and the fears
Americans have of an area they don't understand. It's a feathered
version of all the fears of foreign entanglements we've worried
about since Washington's Farewell address. By Phil Patton.

   MOTORCOACH-RESORT (Undated) _ A few miles, as the pelican flies,
from the warm green waters of the Gulf of Mexico, tan bodies
gathered round a patio table. The conversation paused when an
engine rumble neared. A new neighbor was moving onto Southern
Breeze Drive. ``Nice,'' Kraig Brechbuhler said as the newest home
on the block rolled by, its burgundy-and-gold sides sparkling in
the noon sun. In the gated community known as Pelican Lake
Motorcoach Resort, not only do the neighbors come and go, but so
also do the homes. No Winnebagos here, however. This resort is
exclusively for luxury motor coaches, most of them longer than 37
feet. They look like tour buses for rock stars. By Diane Ketcham.

Gluckman of New York, the 296-seat playhouse is an architectural

<P>
   SEATTLE _ Dr. Phil Ballard had seen all sorts of bizarre
patients in psychiatric emergency rooms. But he'd never seen one
like George Carillo.
</P>
<P>
   It was 1982, and Ballard _ now head of the Movement Disorder
Center at Swedish Medical Center here _ was completing a neurology
fellowship at Stanford University. He'd been called in to consult
on a 42-year-old man who sat frozen mid-gesture, unblinking and
lifeless except for normal organ function. There was no evidence of
mental activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a blank stare and was stiff as a board,'' Ballard said.
Since the patient had come from jail, many doctors who saw him
suspected he was faking catatonic schizophrenia to get out of
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   But it was no act.
</P>
<P>
   After seven days with no change and no diagnosis, Ballard
noticed a slight twitching in the man's fingers. He slipped him a
pad and pencil.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure what is happening to me,'' the patient wrote,
using just his fingertips. ``I can't move right. I know what I want
to do. It just won't come out right.''
</P>
<P>
   Ballard was elated to discover a normal mind trapped inside the
body. Slowly, he pieced together the patient's history. The patient
and his girlfriend were heroin addicts. They'd come down with
symptoms after injecting a street-synthesized version of Demerol, a
``designer drug'' meant to act like heroin.
</P>
<P>
   With that information in hand, Ballard and his boss, Dr. J.
William Langston, set out to solve the mystery of one patient and
ended up making a major breakthrough in the study of Parkinson's
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few weeks, more addicts in strangely frozen
postures began turning up in emergency rooms all over the San
Francisco Bay area. They had one thing in common. Each had been
using designer street narcotics.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators suspected a bad batch caused the outbreak, but
they couldn't identify the contaminant.
</P>
<P>
   Then, by chance, one of the team recalled reading an obscure
journal report years earlier of a young college student who had
ended up with identical symptoms after synthesizing his own drugs
in 1976. After he died 18 months later, an autopsy revealed the
distinctive brain damage associated with Parkinson's disease. Until
then, doctors had almost never seen Parkinson's in someone so
young. And they'd never seen it develop overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Ballard set out to find the article, which wasn't even in the
medical center library. ``I dug it out of the dusty reaches of the
racks of Stanford library,'' he said. ``I realized as I was reading
it that this is it, this has got to be it.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it turned out that a contaminant called MPTP caused both
the college student's symptoms and those of the street addicts.
</P>
<P>
   MPTP can slip across the blood-brain barrier, where it converts
into a chemical that kills the dopamine-producing cells in the
brain. A shortage of dopamine _ the main neurotransmitter involved
in coordinating movement _ leads to Parkinson's disease.
</P>
<P>
   In their quest for a new high, the addicts had inadvertently
given themselves an irreversible, debilitating disease.
</P>
<P>
   But they gave the scientific community something else: a clue to
what causes Parkinson's disease. MPTP resembles many environmental
chemicals, including pesticides, which led to the now widely
accepted theory that toxins induce Parkinson's.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to providing a key breakthrough in understanding the
disease, MPTP gave researchers a way to induce Parkinson's disease
in animals, giving them for the first time a model for testing new
drugs and other therapies.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the original addicts received experimental
treatments, such as fetal cell implants, that grew out of that
research. In some cases, it dramatically improved their symptoms,
allowing them to resume a more normal life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was quite a chase,'' Ballard said. ``We had a lot of dead
ends and a lot of lucky breaks.''

TWO CARETAKERS SHATTER ISOLATION AND SILENCE

<P>
   SEATTLE _ Parkinson's disease can be paralyzing, not just in its
symptoms, but in its effects on family members as well.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bell of Seattle remembers his feelings of immobilization
and helplessness when he learned that his mother had Parkinson's.
</P>
<P>
   ``The frightening aspect of finding out a loved one has
Parkinson's is that then you're on your own,'' he said. There's no
one-stop resource center to tell the patient and family what to
expect, or how to cope.
</P>
<P>
   Bell, 38, has struggled alone to find answers for his mother
over the past 12 years. And he's watched as the disease has touched
more family and friends. Since his mother's diagnosis, his
stepfather, his godfather and his uncle's brother have all been
diagnosed with Parkinson's.
</P>
<P>
   Then he ran into Craig Howard, a former business colleague.
Howard, 37, had a similar tale. His stepmother has had Parkinson's
for 15 years. He, too, had found coping with Parkinson's an
isolating, frustrating experience.
</P>
<P>
   Together, Bell and Howard founded the Northwest Parkinson's
Foundation to help make it easier for patients and families to get
better answers about the disease. The foundation's goal is to
establish a comprehensive Parkinson's institute in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The year-old foundation is now a full-time commitment for both.
They are on the verge of signing a partnership agreement with a
local hospital to provide space and support for the institute,
which they expect to open by mid-summer. The center, which will
have a budget of about $1 million a year from private donations and
insurance coverage, will provide full-spectrum care for patients
and support services for families. The foundation will pick up some
of the services not covered by patients' insurance. The foundation
also plans to promote research.
</P>
<P>
   ``There hasn't been a focused center for care and knowledge of
Parkinson's in the Northwest,'' Howard said.
</P>
<P>
   The new center is modeled on the Struthers Center in Minnesota,
and will provide a holistic approach to managing Parkinson's. In
addition to medical treatment, it will provide exercise programs,
nutritional counseling and music and art therapy, as well as
occupational, speech and physical therapy. It also will provide
classes, support groups and respite care for caregivers.
</P>
<P>
   Managing Parkinson's disease is as much an art as a science,
Bell said. Patients often can improve the quality of their lives
substantially by changing or adjusting their medications.
</P>
<P>
   But such fine-tuning takes a tremendous amount of communication
among patients, caregivers and doctors, especially as new
treatments become available at an increasing rate.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of information-sharing is a primary goal of the
Parkinson's Foundation, Bell said.
</P>
<P>
   Parkinson's tends to isolate patients, Bell said. ``A lot of
people retire to their chairs,'' he said. ``They have no outlet for
their frustration. People excuse themselves from public lives.
Depression is common.''
</P>
<P>
   The foundation's other goal is to raise public awareness.
</P>
<P>
   Parkinson's is a forgotten disease, Bell said. ``We've never had
a Jerry Lewis.''

PONDDERING THE LONGEVITY OF `LAW &AMP; ORDER'
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by TV-DURABILITY) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's quite a buzz right now about HBO's witty mob series
``The Sopranos,'' and rightfully so. What a tragicomedy for the
ages. In one season, it has outflanked anything the green-with-envy
networks have sent through the programming grinder in years. ``The
best drama on TV!'' gushed one impressed critic. ``Could it be the
best ever?!'' wondered another.
</P>
<P>
   That said, certain distinctions should be made when making
shout-outs to the best of anything, particularly a drama series
with a life span of 13 episodes. Or three years. Or five, even.
</P>
<P>
   Series durability came to mind recently after I'd digested
another episode of ``Law &AMP; Order'' and felt bloated with anger,
sadness, pity, amazement, amusement, surprise _ and it was a repeat
I'd caught before.
</P>
<P>
   Thing is, TV programs are like thoroughbreds: usually three to
five good years and then out to pasture. Part of it is the
difficulty of sustaining dramatic friction. Another is simply
viewer weariness.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Law &AMP; Order,'' recently renewed for an unprecedented three
seasons, is still trucking after nine years. It's not only the
longest-running drama on the tube, but also the most consistently
good TV series I've ever witnessed.
</P>
<P>
   You're certainly most welcome to argue, but ``L&AMP;O'' has had
good-to-excellent seasons ever since producer Dick Wolf introduced
it in 1990 as an odd, gimmicky show with a half-and-half structure
of gumshoe policing and courtroom theatrics. All would deal with
issues and/or ideas, from a greedy surgeon harvesting organs of
not-yet-dead crime victims for transplant operations to the
upcoming (May 4) episode touching on sex crimes, boasting a Julia
Roberts guest spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``L&AMP;O'' is usually among Emmy nominees for best drama (it won in
1997), so it's interesting that the show has managed to steer clear
of the critical backlash often meted out to programs that have
found some measure of success.
</P>
<P>
   My theory is that media heat is applied to shows that display
showboating hype; ``L&AMP;O'' has merely been the dutiful employee, the
quiet, roll-up-the-sleeves type getting the job done and leaving
without complaint.
</P>
<P>
   The downside is that whenever a hot-to-trot drama like ``NYPD
Blue'' and now ``The Sopranos'' enters the ring, we take ``L&AMP;O''
for granted, filing it away in our collective TV consciousness
because we know it will always be there if and when we need it.
</P>
<P>
   On other fronts, ``L&AMP;O'' has been the butt of jokes and the envy
of producers over its inability to hang on to its regular cast
members. (This year's cast is set to return next season _ so far.)
That it can move along smoothly with new faces is a testament to a
storytelling formula that bucks the trend by relying far less on
character-driven situations.
</P>
<P>
   I can't count how many calls were logged here from fans steamed
about the addition of Dallasite Angie Harmon, whose resume is
peppered with modeling credits and ``Baywatch Nights.'' First
thought was that ``L&AMP;O'' producers were going soft, or that Harmon
wouldn't leave her sexuality at the door, blowing wide open Wolf's
refusal to deal with personal angst.
</P>
<P>
   Other than a few shots of Harmon's Assistant District Attorney
Abbie Carmichael strolling along a New York City street, her thighs
playing peek-a-boo out of the slit on a just-above-the-knee skirt,
her sexuality has been relatively tame. (Unless you count that
smoldering, just-out-of-bed voice, which Wolf can't do much about.)
</P>
<P>
   In fact, I'm of the minority who think Harmon is just as
effective in that role as were Carey Lowell, Jill Hennessy and even
Richard Brooks.
</P>
<P>
   Exchanges between Carmichael and her boss, district attorney
Jack McCoy (Sam Waterston) are tinged with a level of suspicion _
as though there's a game of one-upmanship creeping into the
proceedings. How many times has Carmichael given McCoy the evil eye
after he's gotten what he wants or mumbled something indirectly
patronizing?
</P>
<P>
   Even the partnership of detectives Rey Curtis (Benjamin Bratt)
and Lennie Briscoe (Jerry Orbach) has grown on me _ Bratt's
stiffness is now offset quite nicely by Orbach's crankiness. It's
as if Briscoe is the young Turk to Curtis' road-weary veteran.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when the infrequent screen time of cops boss
Lt. Anita Van Buren (S. Epatha Merkerson) was bothersome, what with
the tendency of cop dramas to hand roles of precinct captain to
black characters in order to downplay their existence. But how can
you have a beef with a character who remains true to the show's
formula?
</P>
<P>
   If ``NYPD Blue'' is a drama about the emotions of cops and
robbers, ``L&AMP;O'' has the market on ideas. Although it sometimes
pulls too heavily from real news stories, its added twists and
turns are always an intriguing take.
</P>
<P>
   When it doesn't pick apart an event, its tendency to add a
multitude of wrinkles is arresting. Take last week's episode, which
dealt with the unraveling of a 30-year-old murder. Before the hour
was up, it had delved into the atmosphere surrounding '60s
rebellion, the Vietnam War and cover-ups supplied by the U.S.
government and the police department.
</P>
<P>
   It was vintage ``L&AMP;O'' _ the way it's been nearly every week for
nine seasons.

   Starting Moonflowers
</P>
<P>
   Q. Please help. Last year and the year before, I planted
moonflower seeds, and nothing came up. I even soaked them longer
than overnight, seeded them in shade, sun, just name it. Not one of
the seeds sprouted. Can you give me some advice for this year's
attempt?  &QL; 
A. What the morning glory is to the day, the moonflower is to the
night. This twining vine produces lovely heart-shaped or lobed
foliage, but later in the season it begins to send out what look
like tightly furled umbrellas that get longer each day.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, one late afternoon, one or two uncoil before your eyes
into a six-inch-broad, green-tinged white flower with a deep throat
_ a landing pad for night-flying moths attracted by the sweet,
light fragrance.
</P>
<P>
   Collapsed by morning, the old flowers are replaced by new ones
that unfurl each afternoon until cooler days stop them.
</P>
<P>
   Some seeds are just more dependable if started indoors, and
moonflower is one of those. When started outside, if the soil dries
out for even a short period between germination and the time it
comes up through the soil, the seedling can die before you even
know it is there.
</P>
<P>
   Moonflower seeds can be cranky and germination sporadic, but the
results are worth a little extra effort. They need a long growing
season, so start them indoors about now, but don't transplant them
outside until after the last frost date, once the soil has
thoroughly warmed and the weather settled.
</P>
<P>
   Try soaking the seeds overnight and presprouting by placing them
between several layers of paper towel kept damp inside a plastic
bag. Leave the bag unsealed on the kitchen counter. Check them
regularly for sprouting.
</P>
<P>
   Some seeds will sprout in three or four days, others will take
as long as several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The sprouted seeds should be planted one-half inch deep in a
good soilless potting medium in individual four-inch pots.
</P>
<P>
   Leave them in a sunny, warm spot in the pots until they are well
rooted and anxious to go outside.  &QL;

   James Henderson is the largest man I have ever met. He is 6-ft.,
5-in. and weighs 390 lbs., but those statistics cannot do justice
to his extreme gigantism. He is a fridge-freezer with skin.
</P>
<P>
   He is so big, in fact, that I cannot speak. The man has just
flown in from Texas. He is jet-lagged. He has bothered to come all
the way to Hackney in east London to tell me what it is like to be
a Muscle Man for God.
</P>
<P>
   He has also promised to break a few concrete blocks. I should be
talking to him about his life, his work, his story. Instead I am
staring at his neck. It is a tree trunk.
</P>
<P>
   James is saying something about God when I interrupt. ``So how
big is your neck?'' I ask. His gold tooth flashes. ``Twenty-three
inches.'' I stare at him some more.
</P>
<P>
   To fill the silence, James volunteers the fact that he has to
have his clothes tailor-made. I look at his black track suit and
wonder if he always has to wear stretchy material. Then I wonder
who sat next to this guy in the plane all the way from Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Then I ask whether he has ever met anyone who was so big. ``Well
I met myself this morning when I woke up,'' he says rather gently.
I do not want to make this man angry. It is time to snap out of it.
</P>
<P>
   This is more easily said than done when you are at the Kingsway
International Christian Center. This is one of the fastest-growing
churches in Britain and it is located in what used to be a
warehouse, next to the dog track, on an industrial estate in
Hackney.
</P>
<P>
   There is no steeple here, or stained glass, or pews. Instead
there are 4,000 orange plastic chairs and a PA system that seems to
play the New Testament on a continuous loop.
</P>
<P>
   The church's motto is ``Raising Champions, Fulfilling Dreams!''
and it publishes a magazine called ``Winning Ways.''
</P>
<P>
   On the first page there is an article called ``Ten Things Single
Women Should Not Do.'' These include ``Don't Get Foolishly
Passionate'' and ``Don't Get Into Foolish Submission.''
</P>
<P>
   James, plus some 25 other members of the Power Team, are
providing the Easter entertainment here this year. It is a Biceps
for Christ kind of show, with the men blowing up hot-water bottles,
snapping baseball bats, breaking walls of concrete, bending steel
bars and ripping up phone books.
</P>
<P>
   In between violent outbursts, they talk about the Lord. The
whole thing is a bit like evangelical wrestling. There is a special
show with a mass baptism. A pool has been rented and at least 400
are expected to get wet.
</P>
<P>
   There are two kinds of Americans: polite ones and rude ones.
James Henderson and his fellow Power Team member, Jeff Neal, are in
the first category. In fact, they may be founding members of the
first category. They call me ``ma'am'' quite a few times before we
even sit down in the orange chairs for a chat.
</P>
<P>
   Behind us, on the dais, some wavy concrete blocks are stacked
up, ready for demolition. The Power Team manager wants to know
whether James is going to split them with forearm, elbow or hand.
It is decided that this one is for the elbow.
</P>
<P>
   I am told that one Power Team member has perfected the art of
breaking blocks of ice with his head.
</P>
<P>
   James introduces me to Jeff Neal, Man of Steel. He is relatively
tiny, at 6-ft., 2-in. and 335 lbs. He was brought up a Christian,
but found his own particular divine moment at age 13. Since then he
has been ``walking with the Lord.''
</P>
<P>
   Both he and James talk in an evangelical kind of way. When
something important has happened in their lives, it has been
``divine intervention.''
</P>
<P>
   They say that the Lord always picks you up when you are down.
They say that they are in the Power Team as a way of getting our
attention, and then they make a bid to save our souls.
</P>
<P>
   I ask about drugs. It is the obvious question under the
circumstances. Jeff used to play professional American football. He
is a champion weight-lifter.
</P>
<P>
   James is the four-times World Heavyweight Lifetime-Drug-Free
Power-Lifting Champion. Just try getting that on a name badge.
</P>
<P>
   But, really, what about drugs? ``No! And I never have. My
strength is enhanced naturally,'' insists James. Is he sure?
``Well, I've drunk a couple of beers in my life,'' he says. ``That
was before the Lord,'' says Jeff. ``You don't drink at all now.''
</P>
<P>
   They advise me how to blow up a hot-water bottle, and then James
stands up and walks stiffly towards the stacked concrete. I ask why
he is limping. He says that he has come all the way from Texas and
is stiff.
</P>
<P>
   I ask him if I am irritating him. He says that he cannot be
irritated and taps my arm in a sort of a power josh. (Later, I
check for bruises.)
</P>
<P>
   James says crashing through bricks is all about technique, not
strength. ``You need consistent drive,'' he says. He stands behind
the bricks and says ``Pray for me.'' I think this may have been a
joke. Then there is a blur, a thud and a crash. The pulpit area is
littered in concrete.
</P>
<P>
   The team manager tells me that it is far more impressive when
the concrete is on fire. I pause. How does that happen exactly?
Divine intervention? Nope, he says _ lighter fluid. &QL;

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ On the night that the film ``Star Wars'' opened in
America in May 1977, George Lucas was a demoralized, exhausted man.
He had labored for four long years on his space epic, and was
convinced that he had produced a flop.
</P>
<P>
   He was the laughing stock of his friends, one of whom, the
director Brian DePalma, told him to his face that ``Star Wars'' was
one of the worst things he'd ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   Twentieth Century-Fox, the studio that had financed his venture,
was twitching nervously at the prospect of financial ruin, and
board members referred to his film dismissively as ``that science
film.''
</P>
<P>
   So it was in a black mood that Lucas arranged to meet his wife,
the film editor Marcia Griffin, for a quick dinner between work
shifts at the Hamburger Hamlet in downtown Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   What both of them had forgotten amid the strain of their hectic
schedules was that ``Star Wars'' was premiering that very night at
Mann's Chinese Theater, just across the street from the restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   As they sat down, they couldn't help noticing the vast crowds
jamming the pavement outside the cinema.
</P>
<P>
   The lines didn't abate, that night or any other night for months
and months to come. They snaked around the block in cities across
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Almost in spite of himself, Lucas had launched a phenomenon that
was to break all box-office records, invent an entirely new
vocabulary for making and marketing films and introduce the world
to the true modern meaning of the word ``blockbuster.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowds didn't let up for the two ``Star Wars'' sequels,
``The Empire Strikes Back'' and ``Return of the Jedi,'' and they
kept clamoring, whether it was for the merchandizing for the
series, the interactive toys, the novelizations, the videos, or the
digitally enhanced re-release of the trilogy two years ago, timed
to mark the 20th anniversary of the original ``Star Wars.''
</P>
<P>
   And now The Force is about to be with us once more, this time in
the form of a brand new ``Star Wars'' movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Star Wars: Episode 1 _ The Phantom Menace'' opens in the
United States on May 19, but already it feels as though it has been
with us for months.
</P>
<P>
   When the first trailer was shown in cinemas last November, it
provoked a stampede of such dimensions that several hundred
die-hard fans paid the full price of a ticket just so they could
relish the two-minute glimpse of pleasures to come.
</P>
<P>
   When the second trailer was posted on the Internet last month,
it scored 3.5 million hits in the first five days.
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco _ George Lucas's home and the site of the first
``Star Wars'' preview 22 years ago _ fans are anxiously waiting to
find out which cinemas are going to book the film so they can start
queuing a month ahead of time.
</P>
<P>
   Some are even looking for corporate sponsorship to cash in on
the publicity that their peculiar pavement sit-in will inevitably
generate.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas himself has milked the anticipation for all it is worth,
leaking crucial details about the plot, special effects and
production of the new film on the official ``Star Wars'' website.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is almost impossible not to know that ``The Phantom
Menace'' is the first of three projected ``prequels'' to the
original trilogy, that it stars Ewan McGregor and Liam Neeson, that
it is directed by Lucas himself (unlike the second and third ``Star
Wars'' films, which he merely produced), and that it charts the
story of Luke Skywalker's father, Annikin, as he falls from grace
and turns into the evil Darth Vader.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood loves a sure winner, and winners don't come much surer
than this one.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't so much a success story as a case of mass hysteria.
</P>
<P>
   To predict that ``The Phantom Menace'' will overtake ``Titanic''
to become the most profitable film of all time is to predict
nothing at all in the minds of most film industry executives.
</P>
<P>
   For them, the only real questions are whether the film will
manage to earn $100 million on its opening weekend, a feat never
before achieved, and whether its total gross receipts will hit the
near-mythical target of one billion dollars _ equivalent to the
U.S. takings of the first three ``Star Wars'' movies combined.
</P>
<P>
   The unanswered question behind the Lucas phenomenon is: Why?
</P>
<P>
   Why has he touched such a nerve in the popular imagination? What
is it about the films that people, and especially young people,
find so irresistible?
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, explanations were readily offered: Lucas was
uncannily in touch with his own adolescent self and thus with all
adolescents everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Star Wars'' represented a return to the simple moral paradigm
of good and evil after the uncertainties of the Vietnam War and the
dark ambiguities of the films of Coppola, Altman and Scorsese.
</P>
<P>
   In its depictions of youthful vigor without sex, war without
perceptible violence and technical wizardry without Brechtian
guilt, it even heralded the political conservatism of the Reagan
era.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever you make of such theories, they don't begin to explain
the enduring appeal of the series into the 1990s, let alone the
new, as yet unseen film whose attraction seems to reach way beyond
such banal considerations as its actual content.
</P>
<P>
   If Lucas has plugged into the zeitgeist this time, it is perhaps
in his ability to provide reassurance and familiarity at a time of
millennial anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe what he satisfies is our abstract hankering after an
``event,'' our desire to turn a cultural artefact into a grand
occasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have moved into an obsessed world, and maybe this is the
acme of it,'' says Leo Braudy, a professor of English and popular
culture at Lucas's alma mater, the University of Southern
California.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obsession has become the preoccupation of the age, and the
Internet feeds and structures this obsession. Whereas passion for a
movie, or collectables, or comic books was something haphazard and
personal in the past, now it has become institutionalized, with
thousands or millions of people out there to share it with.'' &QL;

production of the new film on the official ``Star Wars'' website.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is almost impossible not to know that ``The Phantom
Menace'' is the first of three projected ``prequels'' to the
original trilogy, that it stars Ewan McGregor and Liam Neeson, that
it is directed by Lucas himself (unlike the second and third ``Star
Wars'' films, which he merely produced), and that it charts the
story of Luke Skywalker's father, Annikin, as he falls from grace
and turns into the evil Darth Vader.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood loves a sure winner, and winners don't come much surer
than this one.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't so much a success story as a case of mass hysteria.
</P>
<P>
   To predict that ``The Phantom Menace'' will overtake ``Titanic''
to become the most profitable film of all time is to predict
nothing at all in the minds of most film industry executives.
</P>
<P>
   For them, the only real questions are whether the film will
manage to earn $100 million on its opening weekend, a feat never
before achieved, and whether its total gross receipts will hit the
near-mythical target of one billion dollars _ equivalent to the
U.S. takings of the first three ``Star Wars'' movies combined.
</P>
<P>
   The unanswered question behind the Lucas phenomenon is: Why?
</P>
<P>
   Why has he touched such a nerve in the popular imagination? What
is it about the films that people, and especially young people,
find so irresistible?
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, explanations were readily offered: Lucas was
uncannily in touch with his own adolescent self and thus with all
adolescents everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Star Wars'' represented a return to the simple moral paradigm
of good and evil after the uncertainties of the Vietnam War and the
dark ambiguities of the films of Coppola, Altman and Scorsese.
</P>
<P>
   In its depictions of youthful vigor without sex, war without
perceptible violence and technical wizardry without Brechtian
guilt, it even heralded the political conservatism of the Reagan
era.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever you make of such theories, they don't begin to explain
the enduring appeal of the series into the 1990s, let alone the
new, as yet unseen film whose attraction seems to reach way beyond
such banal considerations as its actual content.
</P>
<P>
   If Lucas has plugged into the zeitgeist this time, it is perhaps
in his ability to provide reassurance and familiarity at a time of
millennial anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe what he satisfies is our abstract hankering after an
``event,'' our desire to turn a cultural artefact into a grand
occasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have moved into an obsessed world, and maybe this is the
acme of it,'' says Leo Braudy, a professor of English and popular
culture at Lucas's alma mater, the University of Southern
California.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obsession has become the preoccupation of the age, and the
Internet feeds and structures this obsession. Whereas passion for a
movie, or collectables, or comic books was something haphazard and
personal in the past, now it has become institutionalized, with
thousands or millions of people out there to share it with.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   If men are from Mars and women from Venus, which part of the
cosmos does multimillion-selling author John Gray inhabit? And who
tidies his cave?
</P>
<P>
   John Gray, PhD (via a correspondence course) is the author of
``Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus (A Practical Guide for
Improving Communication and Getting What You Want in Your
Relationships).''
</P>
<P>
   First published in 1993, it has since sold 13 million copies in
40 languages _ 13 million! 40 languages! _ and is jam-packed with
pithy little sayings which sound like wholly profound aphorisms
until you realize that maybe they aren't: ``Generally speaking,
when a woman offers a man unsolicited advice, she has no idea how
unloving she sounds to him.'' (p 21).
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, since then he's produced endless variations on the
theme: ``Mars and Venus, 365 Ways to Keep Your Love Alive''; ``Mars
and Venus Forever Together''; ``Mars and Venus in Love''; ``Mars
and Venus on a Date''; ``Mars and Venus Starting Over''; ``Mars and
Venus in the Bedroom.''
</P>
<P>
   Golly, where is it all going to end? ``Mars and Venus Test-Drive
the Fiat Punto''? ``Mars and Venus Wonder Why There Aren't Orange
Ones in Bags of Revels Anymore''? ``Mars and Venus: The Movie''?
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually,'' replies Gray, ``Meg Ryan is real interested in
that.'' ``No!'' ``Yup,'' he replies happily.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is she a typical Venusian, then?'' ``She's a great Venusian,''
he whoops. ``But who would make a great Martian? George Clooney?''
``Sure. Or Tom Hanks.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, I meet Gray, a Texan from Austin who now lives in
California in a big house with ``seven gardens and a beyootiful
(sic) swimming pool,'' at a London hotel. He is here to promote his
latest book _ ``How To Get What You Want and Want What You Have''
(Mars and Venus having yet to get back from test-driving the Fiat
Punto, presumably).
</P>
<P>
   It's a lot of waffle about God and ``love tanks'' and fulfilling
your higher potential; yet, such is John Gray's following, it is
already number four in the best-seller lists here, behind the
original Mars, Venus book, which still sits at number three. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (75-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 375) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This guy is truly a phenomenon, although, physically, he doesn't
especially strike you as one. He is actually quite small and round,
and looks rather like a Babybel cheese with a wig on.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, he is remarkably young-looking for 49. He says this
is because he used to be a monk, still meditates a lot and once
went without sex for nine years _ ``although I've made up for it
since, ha! ha!'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, what is all the fuss about? Why is ``Men Are From Mars,
Women Are From Venus'' now the biggest-selling self-help book ever?
How come John Gray can sell out Carnegie Hall? How come, on top of
all the books, there are also audio tapes and CD-roms and board
games and T-shirts that say ``My wife's from Venus'' (or ``My
husband's from Mars'')?
</P>
<P>
   Across America there are even licensed therapists who have
received accreditation from one of Gray's training courses and can
consequently advertise their services as ``Mars-Venus friendly.''
</P>
<P>
   How come friends of mine who I've previously thought of as sane
have said things to me like ``You haven't read the book? You
must!'' and ``Whatever you do, don't bother a man when he's in his
cave!''
</P>
<P>
   So I do go off and read it. And, yes, I am brilliantly
impressed. It's a magnificent book. It's a total masterpiece of a
book.
</P>
<P>
   The thesis? That men and women are fundamentally different
creatures, and once this is appreciated and behavior tailored
accordingly, we are all destined to live happily ever after.
</P>
<P>
   The differences? Men are goal-oriented. Men value ``power,
competency, efficiency and achievement.'' Men don't want to talk
about problems. Men want to seek solutions. When men seek
solutions, they need to go into their caves (i.e., sit in front of
the television watching football).
</P>
<P>
   Never disturb a man in his cave. Never give a man unsolicited
advice, because it undermines his feelings of competence and
(heaven forbid) he might take it as a criticism. Never shout: ``ALL
I ASKED YOU TO DO WAS BRING A PINT OF MILK HOME, YOU FAT LAZY
LUMMOX!''
</P>
<P>
   I imagine that, mostly, women buy this book. And I would
imagine, too, that it does improve their relationships because,
instead of allowing men to nettle them, they just allow them to get
on with being stupid and idle and sulking a lot. This is why,
possibly, it's all so brilliant, in its way.
</P>
<P>
   And women? Women value ``love, beauty, communication and
relationships.'' Women often just want to talk about their
problems, without necessarily seeking solutions.
</P>
<P>
   Men should listen more. Men should resist offering solutions.
When a woman cries ``I've no time for me!'' he shouldn't say ``Pack
in the job.'' He should say: ``Hmm, sounds like you've had a hard
day.''
</P>
<P>
   And when he forgets the milk she, in turn, should say: ``OK,
honey. Maybe you could remember tomorrow?'' And if he forgets
tomorrow, she should say: ``That's OK. Maybe you could remember
tomorrow?''
</P>
<P>
   ``And you just keep on at it like that until he eventually gets
it,'' says John (Still, it might be wise never to ask a man to
bring you back a kidney, should you ever be in need of an urgent
transplant).
</P>
<P>
   I don't doubt, actually, that men and women are different. But
this is just rehashing ancient, sexist cliches, isn't it? Although,
that said, John's superbly Stepfordy-sounding wife seems to fit the
stereotype rather well.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Bonnie sees I'm in my cave,'' says John, ``she goes out
to shop.'' Bonnie, apparently, will often thank John for dinner,
even after she's cooked it. ``She treats me as if I'd provided the
meal, because I work hard and she is looking for a way to
acknowledge my part in things.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, he doesn't have to be asked 769 times to change
light bulbs or take out the garbage.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Martian world, what's valued are things that make
money. Changing bulbs and emptying trash don't make money...that's
how a man's mind works. But if you ask him to do these things as if
you were asking him for the first time, then give him a little
reward by saying `Oh, thanks so much,' he'll soon jump to it as
soon as you ask. Bonnie only has to say `trash' now, and I'll stop
anything to take it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Can we truly learn something from all this? I don't know. I go
home. It's dark by the time I get there, not because it's late, but
because the bulb's gone in the hall, and has been gone for some
time.
</P>
<P>
   My partner? He is in his cave, eating Kettle Chips and watching
``Star Trek.'' I say: ``It's OK you didn't do the light bulb today.
Or yesterday. Or last year. Maybe tomorrow?'' He says: ``Are you
drunk?'' I soon was. &QL;

TOMATO MAN'S GOT PLUM GOOD PRODUCE AND JUICY STORIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Around Sweetwater, they call Lavaughn
Freeman the Tomato Man. They do it out of admiration for his juicy
tomatoes; they wouldn't make fun of this guy. He's about
6-foot-forever and several hundred pounds. Several.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Freeman is becoming a fixture in downtown Fort Worth, where
he tends his produce stand at Third and Houston streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been selling produce beside the road for 30 years,'' he
said. ``I farm for a living, but you can't make a living farming.
So I started out taking a trailer or two of watermelons to the
Dallas market, and on the way back, I would sell the produce I
picked up there to restaurants along the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, he opened a stand in Sweetwater, and that was where
he gained his reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's trying to get a foothold in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   He was at Fort Worth's Sundance market two years ago, and came
back again last year. He caught the attention of Sundance
management, and they invited him to set up permanent shop on the
parking lot at Third Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``Business has been real good,'' he said. ``Everybody is talking
about how good it is to have something like this down here. A lot
of people live downtown, and they are glad to see us. We're open
from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m., six days a week.''
</P>
<P>
   The produce stand is closed Sundays, but Freeman said there will
probably be Sundays when he'll open up shop.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the biggest rush of customers comes about 7:30 a.m. when
women on their way to the office stop by for fresh fruit, he said.
Then, between 3:30 and 5:30 p.m., people grab bags of vegetables
for their nightly meals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between those evening hours, I don't even get a chance to sit
down,'' Freeman said.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, much of the produce is from wholesalers. The tomatoes
come from a friend south of San Antonio. They are of the Celebrity
variety. Freeman said that in a couple of months, he'll be bringing
in his own.
</P>
<P>
   He and his family farm about 500 acres near Sweetwater, where
they produce tomatoes, melons, squash, cotton, hay and honey. The
cotton and the hay won't make it to downtown Fort Worth, but
everything else will.
</P>
<P>
   A few homemade items dot Freeman's shelves. Aside from his own
honey, he handles apricot and peach preserves made in Canton,
ribbon cane syrup from East Texas and sorghum from Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   He has are grapes, onions, green beans, oranges and bananas,
too.
</P>
<P>
   ``This fall, I'll bring in some of the best-tasting tomatoes
you've ever had,'' he promised. ``They come from caves in
Tennessee.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if shoppers don't like the looks of the produce, they can
still get a good story from Freeman. He is a typical West Texan in
that he's friendly and knows no strangers.
</P>
<P>
   He's willing to spin a yarn if you want. He aims to please. So
does his daughter Tracy, who lives in Fort Worth and runs a produce
stand on East Belknap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember one time when a TV reporter asked me if I used
chemicals,'' he remembered. ``I told her no, and she wanted to know
how I kept the bugs off. I explained that I had some ducks.''
</P>
<P>
   Freeman had her picturing the ducks going to the field every
morning to peck the bugs right off the fruits and vegetables. Each
evening, Freeman said, he and his hired hands would herd the ducks
back into a house where they would be protected from wolves and
coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard my daughter telling the duck story one day, and she
added that I had a blue heeler duck dog. I thought that was
great,'' he said.

HOLLYWOOD GLAMOUR MAKING FOR A NIGHT TO REMEMBER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARBARA DE WITT  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Prom-goers are looking to the stars for
inspiration. And the galaxy favorite is Gwyneth Paltrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is so mesmerized by Hollywood, and this year, more
than others, girls are eager to wear the same gowns they see on the
red carpet,'' says Dan McCann, spokesman for ABS, the Los
Angeles-based manufacturer who's famous for low-priced copies of
designer dresses. According to McCann, the overdone glitz of the
'80s and the ``goth'' looks of the early '90s are so over, and the
younger, fresher look we saw at the Golden Globes and Oscars is,
well, prom-perfect.
</P>
<P>
   So perfect, in fact, that ABS owner and design director Allen
Schwartz will have several copies of stars' gowns available by the
end of the month, including the pink taffeta number with an organza
scarf similar to what Paltrow wore to the Oscars.
</P>
<P>
   Also in a think-pink mood is the prom-goer's bible, Seventeen
magazine. At a recent Glendale Galleria prom fashion show,
Seventeen's merchandising editor, Molly Hover, devoted an entire
segment of the program to pink and another to ball gown silhouettes
similar to Paltrow's dress.
</P>
<P>
   The prom picture?
</P>
<P>
   Says Hover: ``It's a ball gown with a tulle skirt (or
petticoat), a fitted bodice, sparkly chokers, rhinestone studs in
the ears, natural-looking makeup and glittery pink nail polish,
with hair slicked back into a knot or bun ... just like
Gwyneth's.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are other stars and (color schemes) to follow.
According to Hover, the Cinderella-style gown worn by Drew
Barrymore in ``Ever After'' is also predicted to be a winner. She
calls it an Elizabethan style, and it's noted for rich, jewel-toned
fabrics, lace-up detailing in the front or back, possibly with a
small bustle, and is worn with silvery beaded shoes and a tiara.
</P>
<P>
   Tiaras are still ultra-popular, she says, but crystal-accented
hairpins and barrettes, as well as Mellies Sparkles, which attach
to the hair with Velcro, are also star-struck looks.
</P>
<P>
   Hover also noted that the '70s influence in films such as
``Velvet Goldmine'' and ``54'' has inspired sleek modern gowns in
silver, black and white techno-fabrics that hug the body and look
best with stiletto-heeled silver sandals and chandelier earrings.
</P>
<P>
   And for girls who want the flamenco flair of Catherine
Zeta-Jones in ``Zorro,'' there are dance dresses in red-and-black
lace to be worn with feather boas or fringed scarves. If you're
going for this look, Hover says the makeup should be dramatic, with
red lips and nails, and maybe even false eyelashes.
</P>
<P>
   As Hover and fashion show producer Lois O'Hern selected gowns
for the prom preview, they offered some advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, don't even suggest a shoulder corsage, or an orchid or
carnation style. Most girls still want the wrist corsage with
romantic rosebuds or gardenias,'' says O'Hern.
</P>
<P>
   Talking about accessories, both agreed that dyed-to-match satin
pumps were out, and that pastel or metallic sandals and mules with
dainty ``Sabrina'' heels were in. And forget buying stockings, as
bare legs and painted toenails are still fashion-forward.
</P>
<P>
   Small, vintage-looking evening bags accented with beads,
feathers or flowers are in, but gloves have not made a comeback,
even in this retro-crazy year. ``They're a bother. Besides, girls
want to show off their manicures,'' says O'Hern.
</P>
<P>
   Going to the prom in style has always been a pricey project, but
Milinda Martin, fashion director for Robinsons-May stores, says
parents are in luck this year.
</P>
<P>
   According to Martin, ``A decade ago, girls wanted femme fatale
gowns dripping in sequins that were better-suited for a woman of
30, and parents were pushed to spend up to $1,000 for a dress. But
now that the look is more ingenue, with more fabric and less
beading, prices have dropped.''
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line? Expect to pay from $200 to $500, all of the
fashion experts said. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   ANGRY SEX _ When Dad gets mad, watch out. But when Mom is upset,
no sweat. That motto has prevailed in many American families, and
now researchers have found that there is actually a universal
psychological thread to the whole phenomenon. In findings that will
hit home with families of explosive or moody fathers, a recent
study revealed that Dad's negative emotions are transmitted quickly
and powerfully throughout his immediate family.
</P>
<P>
   CIGARETTES _ Since the forced retirement of Joe Camel more than
a year ago, and the recent federal ban on tobacco billboards, big
cigarette companies have come up with new innovative ideas to reach
their consumers. Camel, Marlboro, Kool and other brands have signed
bars and clubs in all major cities around the country to exclusive
contracts. In return for their loyalty, the bars are showered with
gifts, cash, and free cigarettes. Another perk? Bartenders get free
access to all bars signed with the company in other cities.
</P>
<P>
   MILITIAS _ There is a growing movement to organize
African-Americans into armed militias, an effort that has gained
new prominence in the face of publicity about police violence
against minorities in New York. The armed militia advocates
envision a force ready to defend against police whom they believe
are no longer upholding the law but instead are disregarding the
civil rights of minorities.
</P>
<P>
   MOVIE GLUT _ Inspired by the rags-to-riches stories of directors
like Spike Lee (``Do the Right Thing'') and Steven Soderbergh
(``sex, lies &AMP; videotape'') a growing number of aspiring filmmakers
are maxing out credit cards, hitting up relatives for loans and
spending trust funds in chase of the golden ring _ fame, money and
adulation.
</P>
<P>
   REFUGEES _ Like the 85,000 fellow Palestinians living in this
refugee camp north of Amman, Obeed spends a lot of time thinking
about her homeland. The disappearance of what was once Palestine
from the geopolitical maps has done little to erase its powerful
lure to these refugees who cling to their dreams of returning home.
</P>
<P>
   ETHNIC PR _ The Albanian Media Group works mostly with Albanian
clients and Albanian audiences, packaging information for ethnic
newspapers and other specialized media outlets. For decades, such
ethnic- or culture-specific marketing simply did not exist _ such
efforts were either bunched in with the mainstream or ignored
altogether. Now, as ethnic communities gain market power,
mainstream companies and organizations are realizing they need a
voice in those areas.
</P>
<P>
   BUSINESS ETHICS _ The man who wrote the ``Sullivan Principles,''
a rallying point for protests and economic sanctions against
apartheid in South Africa, is now at work on ethical guidelines for
corporations that deal with regimes considered to be corrupt or
repressive.
</P>
<P>
   THEFT BIRD _ The stuff that dreams are made of was no Maltese
falcon, it was a parrot from the Central Park Zoo.
</P>
<P>
   LIBRARIANS _ Who is that with the pierced navel and Day-Glo
hair? It's your friendly, stereotype-busting librarian.
</P>
<P>
   PATS MARCH _ Marching in the St. Patrick's Day parade in Civil
War garb.

   NEW YORK _ When Dad gets mad, watch out. But when Mom is upset,
no sweat.
</P>
<P>
   That motto has prevailed in many American families, and now
researchers have found that there is actually a universal
psychological thread to the whole phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   In findings that will hit home with families of explosive or
moody fathers, a recent study revealed that Dad's negative emotions
are transmitted quickly and powerfully throughout his immediate
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a bunch of emotional retards out there,'' said
Douglas McKee, a psychotherapist who works in the Atlanta area and
focuses on issues dealing with men and anger. ``They are so out of
touch with their emotions that they are all over the place.''
</P>
<P>
   All over their wives and children, that is.
</P>
<P>
   The new study, which appeared in the Journal of Marriage and
Family, confirms what many women have felt for a long time, that
husbands typically are senders of negative emotions in families,
and children and wives are the sponges.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, men's ``secondhand emotions are like secondhand
smoke,'' said David Almeida, a one of the primary editors of the
study and a professor of psychology at the University of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   And men cannot blame their outbursts on workplace stress, since
Almeida's study shows that women who are the primary wage earners
in the home still bear the brunt of the emotional fallout rather
than taking on the man's role of dumping bad vibes on everyone
else.
</P>
<P>
   So, despite an era of the New-Age, sensitive man, many American
men still simply don't get it. How can this be, in an age when the
male and female psyches have been so dissected that even the most
Neanderthal man must have some clue about getting in touch with his
feelings?
</P>
<P>
   It takes only a trip to the local newsstand to see how the
traditional stereotypes about men and women's emotions are not only
as entrenched as ever but are being reinforced in the popular
media. A recent issue of Mademoiselle featured ``Love Trends:
Pleasures and Perils of Practically Living Together.''
</P>
<P>
   Glamour, meanwhile, advised women on when ``Not to Submit Your
Sensitive Secrets to his Grand Jury Grilling.'' Trendy Marie Claire
tutored women on how to please their men with a story on ``What Men
Would Change About You.''
</P>
<P>
   Next to this well of self-help, men's magazines such as Esquire,
GQ, and Maxim offered not a single article dealing with squishy
``communication'' or ``feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Men just aren't talking about stress in their lives,'' Almeida
said. While they do seem to have no problem expressing anger, men
need to learn introspection to get beyond that point.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not only how I'm feeling,'' Almeida said, ``but what is
making me feel this way.''
</P>
<P>
   But anger and resentment is the male emotion that is most
transmitted in families, according to the new study.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men are not given a lot of space to show fear and sadness,''
McKee said. ``They are fostered to be more independent.''
</P>
<P>
   Men's inability to be anything but angry and their ability to
ruin other people's days most likely stems from boyhood
insecurities, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless you are a star male athlete, you don't measure up,'' he
said. As the boys get older, requirements to be wealthy and
good-looking are stacked on men's plates. Empathy and communication
skills are notably absent from the list of character traits that
men are encouraged to develop.
</P>
<P>
   And men just don't seem to like the idea of digging around
inside their psyches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men can retreat from a conflictual situation,'' Dr. Katherine
Levin said. ``They swallow and swallow their feelings, and then
explode.''
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, McKee contends that when men do get to a place where
they try to communicate, the patterns are so ingrained that their
spouses are just not listening.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some very feeling men out there,'' McKee said, but
many women are not pausing long enough to find out.
</P>
<P>
   In many couples-therapy sessions ``the wife just talks faster
than her husband and doesn't stop,'' McKee said. ``But if I make
the wife pause'' the man feels like he can express himself.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, all hope is not lost, as both men and women have plenty of
opportunity to learn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men are not changing as much as we think,'' Almeida said. ``So
there's lots of room for men to change.''

MARCHING IN NEW YORK CITY'S ST. PATRICK'S DAY PARADE 
</HEADLINE>
   For use by New York Times Syndicate/News Service clients as
desired.  
 By BRENDAN JANUARY  
 c.1999 Columbia News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When I was a wee lad, over a stretch of five years,
my mother wrote a note to excuse me from school every March 17th.
While my friends trudged to Bedford Road Elementary, my sister and
I were on train speeding into New York City to join my grandmother
at the St. Patrick Day's parade.
</P>
<P>
   The boisterous, beer-swilling crowds, the hum of bagpipes, the
booming cadences of drums, the festive banners in various shades of
green, the grinning marchers waving to the crowd is etched in my
memory. I also remember the fickle March weather, mostly chilly and
gray.
</P>
<P>
   I stopped going to the St. Patrick's Day Parade after I
graduated from elementary school.
</P>
<P>
   When my grandmother died eight years ago, I was drawn back. The
parade and my grandmother are merged in my memory. It felt more
natural to go to the parade than to visit her grave.
</P>
<P>
   As a young girl in Ireland, she had washed clothing for
occupying British soldiers. At 18, she left Ireland and came to
America. One of her greatest joys was being a live spectator at the
St. Paddy's Day Parade on Fifth Avenue, the most prestigious street
in America. Since the 1920's, she rarely missed the parade,
ensconced at her favorite corner near St. Patrick's Cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   She often remarked that she felt the parade was a celebration of
Irish success. This year, I wanted to honor her memory. Instead of
watching the parade, I wanted to march in it.
</P>
<P>
   Having an Irish grandmother does not qualify one to march in the
parade. I held no city office. I was not a member of a high school
marching band. I did not play the bagpipes.
</P>
<P>
   A group of Civil War re-enactors who marched every year as the
Irish brigade _ a unit that fought in the American Civil War _ was
my ticket. I contacted the brigade commander and was invited to
march.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish Brigade holds a special place in Irish-American
history. Although 150,000 Irish-Americans fought in the Union army,
only the Irish brigade served as an all-Irish unit. Carrying bright
green battleflags next to the American colors, their exploits and
bravery on the battlefield helped Irish immigrants overcome rampant
anti-Irish sentiment and discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   The brigade has marched in honor of Irish soldiers in the St.
Patrick's Day parade since 1984. On the morning of March 17, I rode
a subway to the Fort Hamilton section of Brooklyn, and joined about
200 re-enactors at a spot near the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. Around
noon, we formed into long columns and marched to the subway for a
ride into Manhattan to the start of the parade. Motorists braked
their cars to a stop and honked as we passed by. People on their
front stoops laughed and waved.
</P>
<P>
   We were dressed like authentic soldiers of the Civil War. I wore
a navy-blue, wool jacket, sky-blue wool trousers, leather shoes,
and a wool hat called a kepi. I kept my trousers up with a two-inch
wide leather belt with a bright brass buckle. A leather cartridge
box and tin canteen slung over my shoulder. To round out my outfit,
I hefted a 9-pound, five-foot long musket equipped with a bayonet.
</P>
<P>
   By 2:30 p.m., we stood in the shadows cast by office buildings
on East 47th Street, awaiting our turn to join the parade. St.
Patrick's Day had rarely seen finer weather, balmy with strong
sunlight driving the temperatures into the 60s.
</P>
<P>
   After an hour, our wait ended. Following a high school band
dressed in bright royal blue and yellow trim, we turned right onto
Fifth Avenue and began the 40-block march uptown.
</P>
<P>
   Spectators were packed tight along the parade route. We strutted
smartly and smiled at the crowd. Somewhere, my mother and aunt was
among the revelers but I never saw them. People leaned on the
pale-blue police barricades and pointed at marchers. As we marched
those first blocks, applause and cheers came from both sides of the
street.
</P>
<P>
   At 51st Street, we paused in front of St. Patrick's Cathedral.
In the most solemn and hallowed moment of our march, the men
carrying the regiment's battle flags turned and faced the church.
Silently, Cardinal O'Connor stepped out and gestured a cross with
his hand, blessing the flag. It was the only time he personally
gave a blessing during the parade.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinal O'Connor inspired this tradition five years ago, when
he noticed the re-enactors in the parade. A Civil War buff, the
Cardinal contacted the re-enactors and offered to bless the battle
flags, just as the cardinals blessed the Irish battle flags during
the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is such an honor,'' said Stephan O'Neill, who carried the
bright green Irish battleflag in the parade. ``I feel tremendously
proud when he blesses the flag.''
</P>
<P>
   We resumed marching up Fifth Avenue, passing the FAO Schwarz toy
store and the Plaza Hotel. From the street, the crowd was a blur of
bright faces in a sea of green.
</P>
<P>
   As we wound our way toward the end of the parade route, the
crowd lessened. At some spots, the bleachers stood empty. At one
point, it was so quiet that we could hear the stomp of our boots
against the pavement.
</P>
<P>
   The lull ended abruptly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking good guys! Looking good!'' screamed five young women
who each wore T-shirts with a different word stamped on front,
which together said: ``Flown in fresh from Belfast.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Eyes right,'' shouted a brigade leader.
</P>
<P>
   A parade is not a parade without hecklers. ``The war's over!'' a
male spectator shouted.
</P>
<P>
   At 86th Street, we turned off Fifth Avenue and dispersed. I was
surprised instead of feeling elated, I felt a little flat. Perhaps,
it was the warm temperatures. Perhaps, it was knowing my
grandmother was not there at her usual spot, but I did not feel the
same electricity that I had from past parades.
</P>
<P>
   As I walked across Central Park to return to my apartment,
people acknowledged my uniform. ``Was it fun?'' asked a homeless
man.
</P>
<P>
   A jogger halted in midstride and offered congratulations.
</P>
<P>
   An Italian tourist asked if I fought for the South.
</P>
<P>
   A tour bus filled with Japanese excitedly took notice as I
waited at a street corner.
</P>
<P>
   At that moment, even more than in the parade itself, I could
suddenly relate to what James Barker, a member of the parade's
organizational committee, had said, ``The whole world is Irish on
St. Patrick's Day.''

   NEW YORK _ Holly Hudson's first film cost $20,000, and she
cannot get anyone to watch it.
</P>
<P>
   The 33-year-old off-Broadway actress poured dreams of stardom
and a small inheritance into her 10-minute short, ``Pipe Dreams.''
It was an investment _ Hudson hoped the movie would catapult her
into a career directing Hollywood films.
</P>

   Nine months later, the movie has been publicly screened only
twice. In October, ``Pipe Dreams'' had its debut at the Leeds
International Film Festival. The encore show came four months
later, at a New York City institution known for less ambitious
films _ Show World, the 25-year-old granddaddy of the dying Times
Square sex industry. Before a citywide crackdown on porn in
December, the screening room was Show World's peep show.
</P>
<P>
   The 40 young bohemians gathered in the screening room,
embellished with floor-to-ceiling mirrors and black and red tile,
applauded Hudson's film, one of seven shorts on a Friday night
program. But no one in the audience could jump-start Hudson's film
career or bankroll her next picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone wants to win the lottery,'' said Hudson, who
submitted ``Pipe Dreams'' to about 20 film festivals, both in this
country and abroad. ``It was an alarming wake-up call for me. I
have had a hard time, and I know that there are a lot of films
worse than mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by the rags-to-riches stories of directors like Spike
Lee (``Do the Right Thing'') and Steven Soderbergh (``sex, lies &AMP;
videotape'') a growing number of aspiring filmmakers are maxing out
credit cards, hitting up relatives for loans and spending trust
funds in chase of the golden ring _ fame, money and adulation.
</P>
<P>
   While every college campus and two-horse town has sprouted a
film festival, the number of filmmakers has increased even faster,
people familiar with the industry say. At the New York Academy of
Film, for instance, enrollment has doubled nearly three times since
1993, with high school kids, narcotics lawyers, archivists and
Buddhist monks filling out the student body. With so many movies
being made, the odds of a talented amateur being noticed by a
studio executive or industry insider has become increasingly slim.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indie films are like the garage bands of the 90s,'' said Steve
Gallagher, associate editor of ``Filmmaker'' magazine. ``There are
thousands of films being made and there is no way to show them _
not at industry shows, not at art houses, not at film festivals.''
</P>
<P>
   If festivals are now swamped with independent films, they will
soon be drowning in them. Filmmakers can now shoot their pictures
on digital video cameras for a fraction of the cost of shooting
16-millimeter film. Everyone who ever wanted to make a movie can
afford to get in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the big fear,'' said Milton Tabbot, director of the
Independent Feature Film Market, an industry trade show in New
York. ``Now, everyone will go out and make a movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Sundance Film Festival, the premier film festival in the United
States, is already so deluged with submissions that filmmakers
disgruntled by rejection slips spun-off a sister festival,
``Slamdance.'' This year, 1,310 short films jockeyed to be one of
58 shorts shown at Sundance, said publicist J.R. Millard. The
competition was just as fierce for full-length dramas: out of 840
entries, 35 were accepted. There's no guarantee the films that are
accepted will ever appear before a broader audience, or that the
filmmaker will be offered any money or a job. Four months after
Sundance ended, only nine of the 35 full-length movies and two of
the shorts had been purchased for release to movie theaters or
cable television.
</P>
<P>
   Even obscure film festivals are wildly competitive. This year,
the three-year-old Iowa Independent Film Festival rejected 80
percent of movies submitted. The P.S. 99 short film festival in New
York City is sifting through 900 movies to find 30 worth showing.
Out of 115 submissions, only 11 made it to the big screen at the
Weekly Alibi Short Film Fiesta in Albuquerque, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   Festival director Devin O'Leary said only one of these has
generated any kind of commercial interest: ``Feed,'' a three-minute
abstract film about a desert wanderer's internal monologue, earned
local director Brett Biescheid a flight to Los Angeles and
interviews for a job directing shoe commercials.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a whole history of people making low-budget films and
finding commercial success _ the Cinderella story,'' said
Gallagher, the editor. ``Because so many films are being made, it
makes it so much harder for the distributors to wade through the
muck and find the gems.''
</P>
<P>
   Many young directors lack talent and originality, said Joe
Pilaro, coordinator of the graduate film program at Columbia
University. The chief bugaboo of bad indie films, he said, is a
humdrum plot.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a lot of the films, the visual story telling is good, the
cinematography is good, but the story sucks,'' Pilaro said. What
they are missing, he said, is ``traditional storytelling _
protagonist, antagonist, all that good stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   The television show ``Ally McBeal'' provides a popular pattern
for low-budget films, Pilaro said. So is the chummy comedy
``Friends.'' ``In the grand scheme of things, these movies are very
similar,'' Tabbot said. ``Guys sitting around, talking about what
they are going to do with the rest of their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Holly Hudson's ``Pipe Dreams'' resembles ``Ally McBeal'' to the
extent that the fantasy life of the protagonist, an actress played
by Hudson, is acted out on the screen. In ``Pipe Dreams,'' an
actress' overbearing, abusive mother materializes at a movie
audition to provoke a dramatic performance from her daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson had several advantages in making the film. Her husband, a
production assistant on ``Martha Stewart's Living,'' lent his
technical know-how. And Hudson recruited friends from her years on
stage to act for free. Still, the movie couldn't have been made
without the small inheritance left by her parents.
</P>
<P>
   Expense must discourage many would-be filmmakers. An old-timer's
rule of thumb is to budget $1,000 for each minute of a
16-millimeter film, said Kelly Markus, programmer of the P.S. 99
film festival and the co-producer of a full-length documentary
about the 100th anniversary of Jell-O. The picture is in hiatus for
want of $50,000 to $60,000 to finish editing.
</P>
<P>
   But with a digital video camera, images are stored on computer
chips. There is no film to buy or develop. Each individual take can
be viewed by simply plugging the camera into a television, and
editing is done on a home computer. Software that costs about $500
produces effects available only in the fanciest film studios. Once
video is transferred onto film, only the most careful observer can
tell the movie was made digitally. Though this final transfer is
very expensive _ about $6 per foot of film _ shooting digital video
cuts the total cost of making a movie roughly in half.
</P>
<P>
   Already, several ``reality'' television shows are shot in
digital video, and one of the Independent Film Channel's 10 best
films of 1998, ``The Last Broadcast,'' was made on digital video
for less than $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   The ``digital film revolution'' will democratize filmmaking,
predicted Peter Graham, editor of the Independent Film Channel's
Web site. Cheap digital video cameras will put movie-making tools
at everyone's fingertips, and the Internet will provide an
unlimited showcase for their work. Movies, he said, ``are the new
way people are going to tell their stories.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, the Independent Film Channel's web site broadcasts
movies over the Internet, and many other Web sites allow visitors
to download a short clip. But few filmmakers will be satisfied with
just an Internet screening. The picture is only slightly larger
than a pack of cigarettes, and motion across the tiny screen
appears jerky. While the quality may be better with a high-speed
cable connection to the Internet, this technology is only available
in a few parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Even more worrisome to some is the prospect of their film being
lost in cyberspace. Although some filmmakers make art for art's
sake, ``they all have the dream of winning the Academy Award,''
Pilaro said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the tepid success of ``Pipe Dreams,'' Hudson still
clings to her dream of making it to Hollywood. She has already
started her second screenplay, which bears similarity to her first.
In the new full-length film, an actress is plagued by her mother's
ghost as she performs a one-woman play. If Hudson gets another
chance to put ``Pipe Dreams'' before a live audience, she won't
turn it down. Even if it means another porn house debut.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am happy for anyplace where people just want to screen the
film,'' Hudson said. ``That is what it is all about.''

MILITIA MOVEMENT GROWS IN URBAN AREAS 
</HEADLINE>
   For use by New York Times Syndicate/News Service clients as

 By WILLIAM MURRAY   
 c. 1999 Columbia News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In St. Mary's Episcopal Church, a flurry of fists
shot upward. Chants of ``black power, black power,'' rocked the
sanctuary, reverberating toward the stained glass windows and the
26th Police Precinct across the street.
</P>
<P>
   The People's Militia of New York was meeting for the first time.
Applause rebounded every time a speaker proclaimed the need for
African-Americans to arm themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It must be said, brothers and sisters, some police have to
die,'' said Malik Shabazz, a lawyer who had traveled to New York
from Washington, D.C., to help start the group.
</P>
<P>
   Organizer Viola Plummer drew rousing cheers with her quote from
the Declaration of Independence: ``It is the people's right and
duty to throw off such government and to provide new guards for
their future security!''
</P>
<P>
   The gathering earlier this year was part of a growing movement
to organize African-Americans into armed militias, an effort that
has gained new prominence in the face of publicity about police
violence against minorities in New York. The armed militia
advocates envision a force ready to defend against police whom they
believe are no longer upholding the law but instead are
disregarding the civil rights of minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``You may not know that you are at war,'' Plummer told the
audience of some 100 men and women. ``But we in the movement know
we're waging war.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the idea of a people's militia has been most prominent
in recent years among rural, white racists and anti-government
skinheads, some black Americans now see militias as a way to gain
more control over their own communities. In New York, these
sentiments were fanned by the police shooting of an unarmed West
African immigrant, Amadou Diallo, and the alleged police beating of
a Haitian immigrant, Abner Louima, which resulted in the trial of
four officers this year.
</P>
<P>
   The disconnect between black residents and the New York police
dovetails with a resurgence of black nationalism nationwide along
the lines of the Black Panther Party. The Panthers, a
controversial, militant group that began in the 1960s, at times
participated in shoot-outs with police but also engaged in
community organizing to provide such services as health clinics and
neighborhood patrols.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not at all surprised that the militia groups are seizing
on police brutality as a way to re-form themselves,'' said Hugh
Pearson, an African-American journalist who wrote a book on the
Black Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope they don't devolve into the crazy mess that the
old Panther Party became. There was infiltration into the party by
the FBI, but the principle reason for the party's downfall was the
thuggish behavior of genuine party leaders toward party members.''
</P>
<P>
   The romantic memory of the Panthers and its message of black
self-reliance
</P>
<P>
   motivate some of the current militancy. And police violence
against blacks has helped spawn black militia movements in
Milwaukee, Los Angeles and St. Petersburg, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   In Jasper, Texas, last year, armed members of the Dallas New
Black Panther Party arrived at a Ku Klux Klan rally armed with
guns, but the police arrived before violence could occur.
</P>
<P>
   Police organizations around the country are also paying
attention to the black militia movement and fear a return to a more
confrontational period.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the problems we're having is that people are mixing the
concept of police brutality and the police use of deadly force,''
said Mort Feldman, executive vice president of the National
Association of Chiefs of Police. ``If the Abner Louima allegations
are true, then justice should be served.'' But that alleged
brutality, involving a severe beating of Louima by four officers at
the station, should not interfere with legal use of force by
police, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have are loose-knit groups which react to situations
of perceived brutality,'' Feldman said.
</P>
<P>
   The militia advocates, however, say the time has come for
drastic measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about a people's militia whose sole intent is
the defense of our people,'' said Jonah Thomas, a lawyer who spoke
at the St. Mary's meeting.
</P>
<P>
   When whites and blacks arm themselves, the motivations are
different, but the result is ``a kind of Balkanization,'' said Mark
Potok, spokesman for the Alabama-based Southern Poverty Law Center,
which tracks white supremacy groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same thing but different,'' Potok said. ``In black
communities the visceral reaction is police brutality. In white
communities it is seen as repression by the federal government's
tax system. But it's manifested in the same way _ in gunplay.''
</P>
<P>
   In a month of protests after the Diallo shooting, more than
1,000 people were arrested in front of New York City police
headquarters until a Bronx grand jury indicted four officers for on
charges of second-degree murder. Despite Mayor Rudolph W.
Giuliani's pledge to rebuild frayed ties between the police and the
city's minority communities, militia rhetoric paints a bleak
picture of race relations here.
</P>
<P>
   ``When crackers start dying in different parts of town, anytime,
anywhere, any day or night, then the enemy will think twice about
taking yours out,'' said Shabazz, who was the main organizer of the
Million Youth March in Harlem last September. Shabazz and his
organization, the Million Youth March Committee, is aligning with
the New Black Panther Party in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's justice,'' Shabazz said. ``That's in the Koran. That's
in the Bible. It has to happen. Only then will the enemy begin to
have a greater respect.''

ETHNIC FIRMS PUT NEW SPIN ON PUBLIC RELATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   For use by New York Times Syndicate/News Service clients as

 By CHRIS NUTTALL-SMITH  
 c. 1999 Columbia News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Like most public-relations professionals, Vera Osmani
has a message, and she wants to be heard. But unlike most in her
field, she is usually happy pitching to a small audience.
</P>
<P>
   Osmani's Bronx business, the Albanian Media Group, works mostly
with Albanian clients and Albanian audiences, packaging information
for ethnic newspapers and other specialized media outlets. She also
tries to ``sell'' the Albanian community to America at large _
trying, for example, to get mainstream businesses to advertise in
an Albanian Yellow Pages.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, such ethnic- or culture-specific marketing simply
did not exist _ such efforts were either bunched in with the
mainstream or ignored altogether. Now, as ethnic communities gain
market power, mainstream companies and organizations are realizing
they need a voice in those areas. And that means an opening for
Osmani and entrepreneurs like her.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that there's a growing demand to focus
marketing on multicultural markets,'' said Richard George,
spokesman for the Public Relations Society of America, an industry
group.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanic and African-American public-relations firms were the
first to spring up, starting about 20 years ago. Now they have
become commonplace, and firms that focus on Asian, Irish and
continental European communities are joining their ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, many communities have long had advocacy
organizations, cultural associations and lobbying groups to fight
for their interests, but for many, the idea of professional,
for-profit PR businesses is entirely new.
</P>
<P>
   Elena DelValle, director of the Public Relations Society of
America's multicultural caucus and president of LNA World
Communications in Miami, says she makes a living from a reality
that most corporations are only just beginning to face: ``You
wouldn't dream of addressing a Haitian group the same way as a
Hispanic group, or an African-American, or a Jewish audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic-focused start-ups take on a wide range of jobs. Lisa
Skriloff, of Multicultural Marketing Resources, in Manhattan,
concentrates much of her business on Hispanic and Asian clients.
</P>
<P>
   In one project, she is working to attract mainstream sponsors
for a multicultural food festival. She also distributes press
releases when women and members of minority groups get professional
promotions, and she publishes an annual book of minority sources
for mainstream reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's research. Skriloff learns cultural calendars _
something that mainstream PR firms often do not do _ so she can
advise her clients to observe ethnic holidays and celebrations with
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Much of her business comes from advertising agencies, which hire
her to publicize new ad campaigns focused at minority communities.
</P>
<P>
   She says her efforts are often rewarded with cooperation unheard
of in mainstream media. ``Ethnic publications are very receptive to
press releases,'' she said. ``In fact, many times when I send out a
press release they will ask that I send it by e-mail so they can
reprint it verbatim.''
</P>
<P>
   The business is not limited to small, boutique firms, however.
</P>
<P>
   Intercultural Niche Strategies Inc. has in four years built a
booming business marketing music to ethnic communities in the
United States. According to Holly Poirier, the company's
co-principal, the company has worked for major labels such as
Polygram (now Universal) and BMG to market its artists.
</P>
<P>
   For example, when Polygram signed Andrea Bocelli, an Italian
tenor, to its label, Intercultural Niche Strategies worked to
promote the artist in the Italian-American community.
</P>
<P>
   Poirier said her company contracts work to marketing specialists
from within the communities. So far, it's worked on Asian and South
Asian campaigns, as well as Italian, Irish, Scandinavian and
African.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Brown, a vice president of Washington-based Walls
Communications Inc., has worked to help his firm tap into one of
America's most lucrative minority markets.
</P>
<P>
   All of Walls' 17 employees are African-American, and as Brown
describes it, they can help major companies and organizations build
bridges with black communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corporations certainly recognize not only the purchasing power
of certain groups, but also the demographics,'' Brown said. He
explained that as minority populations continue to grow, they claim
a greater portion of the consumer market. He also said that
African-Americans had $500 billion in annual purchasing power. The
business world is catching on, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Walls Communications counts among its clients corporations such
as Shell Oil, DuPont, NationsBanc and Denny's, as well as
organizations such as the NAACP and the National Urban League,
Brown said. All of them want to speak to black audiences.
</P>
<P>
   They want to speak to each other as well, Brown said. He
describes how his firm helped Shell Oil executives connect with the
National Urban League. He boasts that Shell is sponsoring the
National Urban League's annual conference this year, as a result of
the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, such work brings rewards. Brown said his firm earned
about $3 million a year and is growing.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the old-school firms are taking notice, sprouting
multicultural divisions of their own. Raul Garza, director of
multicultural communications for Hill &AMP; Knowlton, the international
public-relations firm, said the company started to specialize in
Hispanic audiences about five years ago because of demand from
existing clients.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the multicultural division has expanded to
specialize in 11 languages and 13 cultures, Garza said. The
expansion has helped them with scores of accounts, he said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, when one of Hill &AMP; Knowlton's clients, the Century
Council, a not-for-profit group that fights underage drinking and
drinking and driving, wanted to speak to Hispanic and Native
American audiences, the multicultural division was able to help.
</P>
<P>
   The firm helped the Century Council develop an education
campaign through the Catholic Church. In archdioceses with large
Hispanic populations, priests would deliver the Century Council's
message directly from the pulpit, and urge parishioners to stand up
in church and pledge not to drink and drive _ so-called La Promesa
Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Hill &AMP; Knowlton helped develop Century Council
brochures aimed at Native American communities.
</P>
<P>
   Garza said that by custom-tailoring messages to specific
communities, they are more effective. ``You want to read about
yourself and you want to hear about yourself,'' he said. ``So don't
just tell me there's so many accidents a year from drunk driving.
Tell me what the incidence is among Native Americans _ just generic
information isn't enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in the Bronx, Vera Osmani yards the conversation between a
coffee-table book about Albania's beautiful landscape, her firm's
Web site and the violence in Kosovo. When people want information
about the Albanian community, she said, she wants them to come to
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a huge community here, and it seems we're getting
everything we know from the American press,'' she said. ``I guess
it's time for us to have our say, to give our picture in this whole
mess.''

ACTOR TAKES $20,000 BIRD _ THEN SINGS TO REPORTER 
</HEADLINE>
   For use by New York Times Syndicate/News Service clients as

 By ALEX LANE  
 c. 1999 Columbia News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On Jan. 27, detectives stormed into Johnny Davila's
house in Brooklyn, dragged him out of bed, cuffed him and
interrogated him at his kitchen table, in front of his mother.
</P>
<P>
   News report about what led to Davila's arrest were sketchy _ the
23-year-old Brooklyn actor was being accused of stealing a $20,000
bird from the Central Park Zoo.
</P>
<P>
   The real story is as strange as it sounds _ it involves the
quirky, over-dramatic actor, a pair of paraplegics, the pricey
parrot and an almost unbelievable coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   Born and reared in Brooklyn, the tall, lanky Davila called
himself an ``outcast of society'' _ and then said in the next
breath that he has ``the best family life anyone could ask for _ a
loving mother, a loving brother and a loving dog named Juju.'' He
dreams of being a famous actor, and he starred in two small,
independent films: ``Latin Boys Go to Hell,'' and the
soon-to-be-released ``Muscle Car.'' The trouble started the night
of Dec. 17, 1998. At about 1 a.m., after a Christmas event near the
Central Park Zoo, a tipsy Davila wandered through an open gate.
(Zoo officials deny that a gate would have been open so late.)
</P>
<P>
   Davila continued into the dark zoo _ no one was in sight, and it
was eerily quiet save for some splashing from the sea-lion pool. He
walked until he came to a plain, low building, and to his surprise
found it open. Inside was a holding area for animals, and it is
here that he happened upon the bird. To hear him tell it, what
happened next was not exactly theft.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like there was this mist,'' Davila said, speaking
slowly and dramatically. ``And ssssshhh, and the bird was there.''
</P>
<P>
   He took the bird out of its cage.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was so _ gullible,'' Davila said. ``I took advantage of his
vulnerability, just sitting in that cage by himself there. He sat
on my hand and nibbled on my finger with his tongue.''
</P>
<P>
   The bird looked at him. ``I said 'Wow, what the are you looking
at, man? Come on man, let's go.' And we went.''
</P>
<P>
   Davila's girlfriend later named the bird Holly because of its
Christmas-like colors _ brilliant green, with a red patch on top of
its head.
</P>
<P>
   What Davila didn't realize is that he had taken a thick-billed
parrot _ valued at $20,000, a member of an endangered species. His
new friend was on loan from the Sacramento Zoo, and was the female
half of a couple brought together under a breeding program called
the Species Survival Plan.
</P>
<P>
   Police began looking for the bird as zoo workers, angry and sad,
puzzled over the crime. Barbara Schwartz was completing her
internship as a veterinary technician at the Zoo while working
nights as a sound technician on the Broadway show ``Beauty and the
Beast.'' She remembers telling a co-worker on the show, Michelle
Hout, about the theft _ Hout understood the significance of the
loss, since her day job was at a parrot shop.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Davila was trying to figure out what to do with the
bird. He thought that it deserved more love and attention than he
could give it. So he called a good friend of his, Ed Jupp.
</P>
<P>
   Davila met Jupp, who uses a wheelchair, two years ago on the set
of a movie called ``Harlem Aria,'' where both were working as
extras. Two or three times a month, Davila would stop by the
midtown-Manhattan apartment that Jupp shares with his longtime
girlfriend, Dawn Scuderi, and talk for hours.
</P>
<P>
   In late January, Davila called Jupp and asked if he could scan a
picture of a parrot into his computer and sell it on the Internet.
Jupp was intrigued.
</P>
<P>
   Scuderi, who uses a wheelchair because of a spinal-cord tumor,
loves animals and has always wanted a parrot. Though Jupp and
Scuderi are deeply in love, she often annoys him when he is trying
to work at the computer in the apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in my office to work and she comes in there every five
minutes,'' Jupp said. ``Then there are two wheelchairs in this
small room and she comes over and says, 'Kiss me, Honey,' and I'm
like 'How many times?!'''
</P>
<P>
   So when Jupp heard that Davila was selling a parrot he quickly
decided ``to get this bird that would keep her entertained so I
could work.''
</P>
<P>
   Scuderi loved Holly just as much as Jupp had hoped _ for a
while. But Holly did not talk much, aside from singing ``La
Cucaracha'' and the ``Woody Woodpecker'' theme, and she would
squawk loudly and often. When Scuderi let Holly out, the bird would
often just climb on top of the cage and lie down. So before long a
bored Scuderi was back to her old ways, rolling into Jupp's office
for attention _ only now Jupp had a squawking parrot in the next
room to deal with as well.
</P>
<P>
   Jupp told Scuderi to call around to pet stores and try to find
one that would be willing to trade a calm, talking bird for Holly
the thick-billed parrot. Most didn't believe she actually had a
thick-billed parrot, and they did not accept trades anyway. Then on
Jan. 23, Scuderi called up the Midtown parrot shop Thirty-third and
Bird.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Hout _ who worked with Barbara Schwartz on Broadway _
picked up the phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gotta get our hands on this bird,'' Hout thought to
herself, as she heard Scuderi offering a thick-billed parrot. She
ran to the back of the store and told the owner, Mike Held, of the
theft and the woman on the phone. Hout got Scuderi's phone number,
and Held called the police.
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, Jupp answered a knock on his door and six
detectives flashing badges strode into his apartment. The next day,
Davila was cuffed and hauled off to the 20th Precinct.
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, back in the hands of zoo workers, the parrot
died. Davila, Jupp, and Scuderi were unaware that Holly had a
dangerous respiratory infection for which she was being treated
with a regimen of antibiotics at the zoo. This smoke-filled midtown
apartment was clearly not the best place for a sick bird.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, that's major animal abuse,'' said Susan Healy, the lead
keeper of the Species Survival Plan at the Sacramento Zoo ``There
was a lot of anger over it. ... Her value in dollars is not worth
half as much as what she was worth as a living creature.''
</P>
<P>
   On March 3, Davila was arraigned in Manhattan Supreme Court on
charges of grand larceny, criminal possession of stolen property,
and burglary. He pleaded not guilty. Davila, who said he was
working on a plea bargain, said he did not think taking the parrot
was a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   You can ``have this animal and people just gawk at it, and throw
little pebbles through cages at it, and all kinds of people just
staring at it,'' Davila said. ``Or you could have it in your home
and give it as much love as any other person would.''

FROM BUNS TO BYTES: IS THE IMAGE OF LIBRARIANS CHANGING ? 
</HEADLINE>
   For use by New York Times Syndicate/News Service clients as
desired.  
 By SARAH DOUGHERTY  
 c. 1999 Columbia News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Tattoos, nose rings, green hair _ sure signs of a
punk rocker, right? No, a librarian.
</P>
<P>
   The media may still get a lot of mileage out of the librarian
stereotype _ a stuffy older woman with her hair in a severe bun _
but librarians know their public image doesn't jibe with reality.
</P>
<P>
   Librarians know the stereotype well. They laugh at it, but also
discuss how it affects their self-image and professional status.
Sometimes they go out of their way to overturn it. But many agree
that the cliche has a certain basis in fact, and that the
information revolution, far from changing the stereotype, may
actually be reinforcing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Librarians love the image and hate it at the same time,'' said
Linda Absher, an in-house librarian for a company in Beaverton,
Ore. ``They are in fact self-absorbed about their image.''
</P>
<P>
   Absher believes that the stereotype is intimately linked with
the fact that the profession was always, and still is, dominated by
women.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public want a female authority figure, if only to rebel
against,'' Absher said. ``And there aren't many female authority
figures, maybe teachers and librarians, that's about it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Absher and other librarians are trying to debunk some of the
myths.
</P>
<P>
   Absher has created a fictitious Web site character _ the
Lipstick Librarian _ an iconoclast who proves that librarians can
be smart, glamorous and take a joke. The site _
www.teleport.com/~petlinliplib _ offers makeup tips (Post-its as a
beauty aid) and a bibliography (``Circulate THIS!! When Circ
Librarians Go Bad'').
</P>
<P>
   There are also Web sites for ``Modified'' librarians (tattoos
and piercing),
</P>
<P>
   anarchist librarians (``Boring Mission Statement: We don't have
one'') and bellydancing librarians (Birkenstocks by day, ``I Dream
of Jeannie''outfit by night).
</P>
<P>
   Eris Weaver entertains incognito in Sonoma County, Calif., as
the Bellydancing Librarian. ``It's a cerebral job,'' she said. ``So
this gives me an outlet. I like playing with people. People's
reactions always crack me up when I tell them I'm a librarian.
Right now my hair is green, St. Patrick's Day and all.'' Weaver's
Web site is at www.wco.com/~eris/bdlib.html.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver does not believe her colleagues are a conservative group.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've met some of the wildest people. And our political beliefs
are not conservative,'' she said, referring to librarians' vigorous
stands on First Amendment issues.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Cherubin, a music librarian at the New York Public Library
and the Ska librarian on the Web, disagrees. He believes the
stereotype has a basis in fact. ``It does tend to draw a certain
type,'' he said. ``Quiet, non-confrontational. I'm a type A
personality, but there aren't many.''
</P>
<P>
   Cherubin says that for many of his colleagues, librarianship is
a second or third career, so they are older and more reluctant to
rock the boat. ``I wanted to stage a walk out to protest the fact
that we haven't had salary raises in several years,'' he said.
``But nobody wanted to make a scene.''
</P>
<P>
   Cherubin says this conservatism often extends to dress. ``I see
people in Earth shoes and I say, who still makes them?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Alysse Jordan, a social work librarian at Columbia University,
finds that librarians also usually have something else in common: a
passion for research. ``I find myself being obsessed with
information,'' she said. ``And I get surprised when I catch myself
falling into that stereotype, like when I'm awake in the middle of
the night thinking about researching a small fact.''
</P>
<P>
   While the technological revolution has radically changed
librarians' work, it does not seem to have changed their image.
``Now our image is combining with that of the computer geek,''
Cherubin said.
</P>
<P>
   To compound this, the general public often assumes that
computers will make librarians obsolete. In fact, many librarians
believe that they will continue to be invaluable intermediaries
between the public and the vast amount and varied quality of data
available on line. ``I think of myself as hacking a trail with a
machete through the deluge of information swamping people,'' Eris
Weaver said.
</P>
<P>
   American Library Association statistics show a steady increase
in library use in the 1990s. ``Librarianship is in fact a growth
profession,'' said Mohammed Aman, Dean of the School of Library and
Information Science at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   But while technology has forced librarians to master many new
skills, it continues to be a relatively low-paying profession. Many
attribute this to the fact that it is traditionally a woman's job.
``Salaries are going up as more men enter the field,'' Aman said.
</P>
<P>
   As librarians struggle with their image, some think that a
change of title would help elicit more respect. Cybrarian has been
one suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   The guest book from the Lipstick Librarian Web site had some
more playful suggestions: Information Goddess and Reference Diva.

TOBACCO MARKETING: THE CAMEL HAS NINE LIVES 
</HEADLINE>
   For use by New York Times Syndicate/News Service clients as
desired.  
 By ITAY HOD  
 c. 1999 Columbia News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At 11 p.m. on Feb. 23, Brian Panerali, a bartender at
the trendy Manhattan club Venue, received his weekly stash. At the
corner of the dark bar, Alicia, the beautiful tobacco agent,
presented her latest bag of goodies: T-shirts, trinkets and best of
all free Camel cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   Panerali held up his booty and smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's awesome,'' said Panerali, 24, who receives two free packs
of Camels three times a week. ``I'm a smoker, so when they give us
free cigarettes, I don't have to buy them. For three dollars a
pack, that's a good deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the forced retirement of Joe Camel more than a year ago,
and the recent federal ban on tobacco billboards, big cigarette
companies have come up with new innovative ideas to reach their
consumers. Camel, Marlboro, Kool and other brands have signed bars
and clubs in all major cities around the country to exclusive
contracts. In return for their loyalty, the bars are showered with
gifts, cash, and free cigarettes. Another perk? Bartenders get free
access to all bars signed with the company in other cities.
</P>
<P>
   Despite repeated phone calls, neither Phillip Morris nor R.J.
Reynolds would comment on their newest promotional strategy.
Alicia, the Camel agent dressed in black, was not talking either.
She refused to give her last name or explain her work. ``I am told
not to speak to anyone about this,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   According to bartenders and club managers, the gig goes like
this. Tobacco agents hop from bar-to-bar bearing gifts: caps,
darts, Benetton watches, bottle openers, Zippo lighters, leather
backpacks and key chains all displaying the popular Camel logo. And
of course, always, cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   Panerali gets 10 packs every two days, two packs to keep, and
the rest to sell or give away to customers who want to ``bum a
couple of cigs.''
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, every week Camel runs a full-page ad in the
Village Voice, where bars signed up with the cigarette manufacturer
can promote special events. Again, free of charge. If a club
decides to throw a party, Camel will pay for posters and flyers,
provided they include a few key words: ``Camel is proud to present
... ''
</P>
<P>
   And once a year, managers receive a $2,000 cash gift, no strings
attached. One phone call and Camel delivers. ``If you show them
that you promote them, they'll give you more money,'' said Deborah
Jackman, lounge manager at the Evelyn.
</P>
<P>
   Camel is even willing to walk an extra mile, all the way to the
municipal building to pick up your license to sell cigarettes. They
will wait in the line for you. And pick up the $100 tab.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few small catches. Bars must sign a contractual
agreement that obligates them to display only Camel memorabilia,
and in big quantities. Also, bartenders must be brand loyal.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are a smoker and you don't smoke Camels, you can't have
your cigarettes seen,'' said Alicia Regan, 27, bartender at the
Evelyn, a bar on Central Park West. ``You can't promote something
else inadvertently.''
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone takes the bait. Rain Lampariello, bar manager
at Merchant's restaurant in Manhattan, has been solicited by Camel
three times this past year alone and consistently declined.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd be selling cigarettes instead of a bar,'' said
Lampariello, who figures he could have saved a few thousand dollars
a month if he had signed up. ``It's cheesy to have beverage napkins
that say 'Camel' on them. You're inviting people into your place to
spend their money and then you try to stuff cigarettes down their
throats.''
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say tobacco critics are not wild about this latest
campaign. Cliff Douglas, a lawyer involved in the first class
action lawsuit against tobacco manufacturers in Florida, is not
surprised that the tobacco companies are mum.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know they're involved in something that's not necessarily
illegal but pushes the boundaries of what's expectable in
society,'' Douglas said. ``If they didn't think they were doing
something wrong, they would tell us all about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Polan, chief federal lobbyist for the American Cancer
Society, said, ``This is yet another decline we would rather not
see happem.'' Polan noted that 420,000 Americans die every year
from cancer and other tobacco-related illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Chad Kawalec, senior vice president at Young &AMP; Rubicam, the
largest advertising agency in New York, thinks it is a brilliant
campaign. Unlike billboards which everyone sees, even those not
necessarily interested in the product, bar advertising captures its
target audience in a direct and fashionable way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about creating an image,'' said Kawalec, who declines
to work on cigarette or liquor advertising. ``It's very effective.
Basically what they are getting is an endorsement from these cool
bars. If Sky Bar, which has a very cool image only has Camels,
Camel will get the halo effect from that image.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a strategy that liquor companies have used for years.
Hennessy cognac used to pay beautiful models to sit at chic bars
and order their spirits. Impressionable onlookers noticed what the
women ordered and decided they wanted the same.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't used to be like this. Cigarettes started out on TV.
When that was banned in 1971, tobacco companies relied on print
media and billboards to promote their products. But those days
ended abruptly in 1994 when ABC aired an investigative report that
prompted a Food and Drug Administration investigation into tobacco
companies' manufacturing practices.
</P>
<P>
   The charge? Spiking cigarettes with extra nicotine to make them
more addictive. The federal government filed a class action
lawsuit. Cigarette companies settled for $246 billion. They were
also banned from billboard advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow tobacco companies always find new ways to woo smokers.
And non smokers.
</P>
<P>
   At the Evelyn in Manhattan, bartender Freddie Metara has seen
the new campaign in action. ``I know for sure that it has changed a
lot of smokers to Camel,'' he said. ``People who wouldn't go
outside to get more cigarettes, bum from the bar. It's making them
smoke more.''
</P>
<P>
   Metara, who was receiving at least six packs of free Camels a
week, said he had asked his agent to reduce his quota. ``I was
smoking like a nut,'' he admitted. ``You can't keep track. Now I
tell her to give me only one pack.''

PALESTINIAN REFUGEES IN BAQA'A, JORDAN DREAM OF GOING HOME  
</HEADLINE>
   For use by New York Times Syndicate/News Service clients as
desired.  
 By DIANE HANDAL   
 c.1999Columbia News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAQA'A, JORDAN _ The sweet scent of olive trees remains only in
Nareen Obeed's mind, a faint memory of her family's garden in
northern Palestine. To Obeed, that scent wafting through the open
windows of the simple farm house had always meant home, where the
land belonged to her father, his parents and their parents and
grandparents before them.
</P>
<P>
   But now the only scent surrounding Obeed's home today isn't
sweet at all. It is dusty and musty, the blending of dry air with
the wet cement that recently was poured to make cinderblock walls
where tent sides had been.
</P>
<P>
   Clutching a Bic lighter in her left hand, Obeed puffed hard on
her cigarette.
</P>
<P>
   Her blue eyes stared straight ahead, her powerful, throaty voice
piercing the quiet room. She talked of her dreams to escape the
two-room hovel that she shares with her 12 children and
grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're are not living,'' she said. ``We are just a number. We
have led a miserable life.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the 85,000 fellow Palestinians living in this refugee camp
north of Amman, Obeed spends a lot of time thinking about her
homeland. The disappearance of what was once Palestine from the
geopolitical maps has done little to erase its powerful lure to
these refugees who cling to their dreams of returning home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wherever we go, nothing can compensate for our homeland,''
Obeed said. But for now, life here is a grim existence that has
only deteriorated since the 1991 Gulf War between the United States
and Iraq. To escape the U.S. warplanes, Iraqi Muslims fled to join
their Palestinian brethren in Jordan's refugee camps, and
overcrowding, along with street crime, has become a serious issue.
</P>
<P>
   Schools have 50 to 60 children per class. Sewage backs up into
the dirt roads and the water shortage worsens each day. The influx
of the Iraqis also means competition in the already tight job
market.
</P>
<P>
   Obeed's family was among 700,000 Muslims who fled their villages
in land that Israel conquered during the 1948 war of independence.
Driven across the Jordan River, they settled in Karameh until 1967
when Israel invaded Jordan's east bank. This time, the refugees
fled to Baqa'a where the United Nations established a city of 5,000
tents. The population swelled over time, and today's encampment
consists of some 14,000 huts, constructed only recently in concrete
_ a sad testimony to the permanence of this place.
</P>
<P>
   A barber shop, hardware store, bakery and drugstore line the
entrance to the camp. Seven doctors work in two health centers, and
the United Nations runs 16 schools that educate children up to
junior high.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the only road are a bus station and taxi stand
where Jordanian commuters, attracted by the bargain prices for
fresh fruits and vegetables and live chickens, disembark to shop in
the camp's outdoor marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Obeed, 53, lives in a typically communal situation, sharing her
hut with her two daughters, two sons and their wives, and six
grandchildren. Their bedding is piled high in a corner of one room
_ thin mats covered in flowered prints. Three bookcase shelves hold
an old-style television, a small boom box and sundry pieces of
clothing. Pots on the floor collect water that leaks from the tin
roof. A large photograph of Obeed's late husband adorns the
water-stained cement wall near the one small window.
</P>
<P>
   ``He worked for the PLO,'' Obeed said, ``and in1979, he was
killed in a plane crash.'' Since then she has supported the family
by working at a U.N. school as a maid. One granddaughter attends
the first grade there. Two others are old enough for kindergarten
but the family cannot afford the cost. ``I make 70 dinar a month
($100), barely enough for bread,'' she said, adding that there are
no jobs for her adult children.
</P>
<P>
   Her neighbors, the Khaleds, are not much better off. On their
wall are arrived 30 years ago with her husband, Mayadh, 55, from
the refugee camp in Hebron. Before his heart attack, Mayadh put
down linoleum floors in the camp. However, many huts still have
dirt floors.
</P>
<P>
   The Khaleds live with their oldest son who takes care of his
parents and 11 siblings. Fatma Khaled weeps openly when talking of
her son, Basil, whom she has not seen in eight years. He was 15
when he walked out the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``He left for school at seven,'' she said, ``took his books,
some change, a small knife_ and never came home. It was March 28,
1991. He went with four of his friends to liberate Palestine and
fight the Jews.'' The boy's mother went to look for him last year
but only heard he was in a prison. What had begun as a young boy's
crusade, an innocent outburst of angry energy, turned into a
lifetime of detention in an Israeli jail.
</P>
<P>
   Never far from the surface here is a bitter resentment against
the Jews who now live in what was once Palestine. ``How do I feel
about them? I am supposed to say they are our cousins,'' said
Obeed, her voice dripping with sarcasm and an eerie laugh. The
coldness in her eyes revealed how she felt about the people who
conquered her land, moved into her home, and vanquished her family.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the Obeed home, small children ripped pages from a
newspaper, the only ``toy'' they had.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young men have no jobs and no hope,'' said Mohammed Amaryeh, a
U.N. interpreter whose family lived in Baqa'a. ``Now gangs, drugs
and alcohol have moved into the camps along with homeless Iraqis
and Egyptians.''.
</P>
<P>
   Youths who complete the U.N. junior high school sometimes go to
vocational schools, said Khaled. But a university education is
usually out of reach. With Jordan's high unemployment rates, jobs
are difficult to find. ``If we're lucky, our children will go to
Russia to study. It's much cheaper there... and the Gulf States to
work as teachers, carpenters, and constructions workers,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Escaping seems the only hope for a decent existence but few take
the option. Instead they remained stuck on the dusty streets of
Baqa'a, surrendering to a life of poverty and dreaming of returning
one day to their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to go back,'' Obeed said. '' What could be worse than
this?''

A NEW SET OF SULLIVAN PRINCIPLES 
</HEADLINE>
   For use by New York Times Syndicate/News Service clients as
desired.  _
 By JEROME LUSSIER  
 c. 1999 Columbia News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The man who wrote the ``Sullivan Principles,'' a
rallying point for protests and economic sanctions against
apartheid in South Africa, is now at work on ethical guidelines for
corporations that deal with regimes considered to be corrupt or
repressive.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Leon Sullivan is writing the code of voluntary ``best
practices'' in collaboration with the State Department.
Undersecretary of State Stuart Eizenstat has said the principles
are mostly aimed at fighting bribery, kickbacks and other forms of
corruption thought to have played a key role in the recent economic
turmoil in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   But though the details of the ``Global Sullivan Principles''
have not been announced, the initiative has already generated some
skepticism, mostly on the part of human rights activists who fear a
global voluntary code will have little impact.
</P>
<P>
   The original Sullivan Principles were written in 1977 as a way
to fight the apartheid government in South Africa without resorting
to withdrawing operations or investments in that country. The six
principles, which dealt mostly with working conditions, sought:
integration of eating facilities and restrooms, nondiscrimination
in employment, equal pay for equal work, training programs to move
blacks into supervisory jobs, and corporate support for
improvements in housing, schools and hospitals for black South
Africans.
</P>
<P>
   The voluntary code proved relatively successful and served as
the inspiration for many subsequent initiatives. In June 1998, the
International Labor Organization adopted a Declaration on
Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, including: freedom of
association, the right to collective bargaining, the elimination of
all forms of forced labor, abolition of child labor and the
elimination of discrimination in employment.
</P>
<P>
   But according to Craig Forcese, of the Canadian Lawyers
Association for International Human Rights, these guidelines only
address one side of the issue. ``Much attention has been devoted to
workplace human rights standards,'' he said, ``but little has been
done about the corporate complicity with repressive regimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Forcese, who is also a visiting professor of law at the
University of Ottawa, cited Myanmar and Nigeria as examples of
repressive regimes receiving substantial financial support from
multinational corporations. He hopes that global Sullivan
principles will address this issue, and recommend that companies
withdraw from countries that fail to comply with human rights
standards.
</P>
<P>
   However, a ``constructive engagement'' approach in countries
with governments that violate these standards holds that the best
way to encourage democratic reforms is through economic
partnership.
</P>
<P>
   Some foreign policy experts and human rights activists consider
boycotts and shareholder activism to be more effective, especially
in the case of image-conscious corporations. When the working
conditions of some of the overseas employees of companies like
Nike, the Gap and Wal-Mart, attracted negative publicity, the
companies reacted vigorously to consumer pressure. The Levi-Strauss
company, often presented as a model of progressive management, has
even instituted what it calls ``country assessment guidelines,''
which address ``larger, external issues beyond the control of
individual business partners,'' for example, health and safety
issues and political, economic, and social conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign policy experts now express cautious optimism about a
variety of approaches to human rights violations. In 1996, Richard
Rothstein, a professor at Occidental University, said that
``whatever success we may now attribute to Sullivan's principles,
the outlook for today's codes is less hopeful.'' On the crucial
issue of monitoring, Mr. Rothstein added that some kind of
enforcement is needed to make corporate codes effective.
</P>
<P>
   Now, three years later, Mr. Rothstein says he finds
encouragement in the aggressive consumer-education campaigns in
industrialized nations, especially on university campuses.
</P>
<P>
   Because the new Sullivan guidelines are to be voluntary,
monitoring and enforcing them may be difficult. But, as Mr. Forcese
says, companies may comply with voluntary codes to preempt the
imposition of stricter, legally binding rules.
</P>
<P>
   He says tools for effective monitoring are already in place,
citing the independent annual reports of Amnesty International,
Human Rights Watch and the State Department as reliable sources of
information on the situation of human rights abuses worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   With generally agreed-upon guidelines, more and more voters
sensitive about the behavior of their corporate ambassadors and
credible international monitoring, the elements of an effective
supervision of corporate practices are in place. ``All that's
missing,'' Mr. Forcese said, ``is a system.''

CLINTON, IN ANY TROOP POLICY REVERSAL, WOULD HAVE A PRECEDENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, April 11)   (For Use By New York Times News Service Clients)  
 By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If Bill Clinton wants a precedent for any reversal
of his stand against sending American ground forces to Yugoslavia,
he can find it by turning the clock back to an incident that
occurred 50 years ago this month.
</P>
<P>
   At that time _ April, 1949 _ the Senate was debating whether to
depart from the republic's long-held opposition to ``entangling
alliances'' and approve U.S. participation in the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Dean Acheson was testifying before the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee and Sen. Bourke Hickenlooper, a
Republican from Iowa, was his interrogator.
</P>
<P>
   Is the United States, demanded Hickenlooper, ``going to be
expected to send substantial numbers of troops over there as a more
or less permanent contribution to the development of these
countries' capacity to resist?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The answer to that question,'' replied Acheson in his most
polished authoritarian manner, ``is a clear and absolute NO.''
</P>
<P>
   That was not one of the most glorious moments in the long career
of Acheson. Less than two years later he returned to the Senate to
seek and win approval for the commitment of U.S. troops to NATO. As
he himself then conceded, his reply to Hickenlooper in 1949 was
``deplorably wrong.'' But he contended that at the time he spoke
there was no commitment for America to send troops to Europe and he
was not convinced such action would be required.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton never has shut the door on troops-to-Europe as tightly
as Acheson appeared to do a half century ago. The president
shrewdly has left it ajar by declaring repeatedly that he had no
``intention'' of sending ground forces into Kosovo. That is not as
final as stating he absolutely would not do so.
</P>
<P>
   But if it is of any consolation to Clinton, historians regard
Acheson as possibly the greatest secretary of state of the 20th
century despite his dramatic and controversial reversal on troops
for NATO. And his boss, Harry Truman, is rated among the near-great
presidents.
</P>
<P>
   The latest Washington Post-ABC poll shows that 55 percent of
Americans support the dispatch of ground forces into combat against
Slobodan Milosevic's murderous forces. Acheson and Truman would
have welcomed such support for their monumental efforts to protect
Western Europe and then South Korea from communist aggression.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they were lambasted repeatedly by their political
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   In 1950, two of the nation's most prominent and conservative
Republicans, former President Herbert Hoover and Ohio Sen. Robert
A. Taft, launched vitriolic attacks against the whole
internationalist concept of the Truman-Acheson foreign policy.
Other Republicans followed their lead.
</P>
<P>
   A corollary assault was voiced by Joseph P. Kennedy, the
millionaire isolationist who had been Franklin D. Roosevelt's
ambassador to Britain in 1939 when the opening shots were fired in
World War II and whose son John would be elected president in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   When Acheson was denying in 1949 that troops would be sent to
NATO, the United States and its allies were just four years past
World War II, the bloodiest and costliest conflagration in history,
and many Americans were skeptical about joining a European
alliance.
</P>
<P>
   But the Cold War was surging across the world, and the
democracies of Western Europe felt threatened by the Soviet Union,
which already had subverted countries behind the ``iron curtain.''
</P>
<P>
   So with U.S. participation, the nations of Western Europe, led
by England and France, had begun to create the alliance that would
become NATO as a bulwark against Soviet expansionism. The initial
concept was that an attack on any one member nation would be an
attack on all of them.
</P>
<P>
   That policy has been broadened with NATO's current determination
to end the cruelty of ethnic cleansing and provide a protected
homeland for hundreds of thousands of Kosovar Albanians driven from
their homes and stripped of all their worldly possessions by Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Although American participation in an alliance with Europe was
first broached by British Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin when Gen.
George C. Marshall was Truman's secretary of state, the proposal
did not reach fruition until Acheson succeeded Marshall in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   By then Acheson already had played a major role in formulating
the Marshall Plan to rebuild war-devastated Western Europe, the
program to aid communist-threatened Greece and Turkey, the Truman
Doctrine to contain communism and the Berlin Airlift to break the
Soviet blockade of that city.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all his brilliance, Acheson _ a tall, imposing man whose
clipped mustache resembled that of the villain in an old-fashioned
melodrama and his aloof manner that of a snobbish British
aristocrat _ was easily caricatured and ridiculed by his enemies.
</P>
<P>
   In 1952, when Richard Nixon was running for vice president on
the Republican ticket, he repeatedly asserted that the Democratic
presidential nominee, Adlai Stevenson, was a graduate of Acheson's
``Cowardly College of Communist Containment.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph McCarthy, R-Wis., the unprincipled communist hunter,
was even more vicious. He accused Acheson of treasonous conduct.
</P>
<P>
   The irony of their attacks was in the fact that the 1952 GOP
presidential nominee, Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, had played a major
role in implementing the Truman-Acheson foreign policy and upon
entering the White House rejected attempts by some congressional
Republicans to return to isolationism.
</P>
<P>
   As for Nixon, shortly before he died, he listed Acheson, John
Foster Dulles and Henry Kissinger as the three great secretaries of
state of the post-World-War-II era.
</P>
<P>
   Acheson, to his recent biographer, James Chace, was ``the
secretary of state who created the American world.'' He is
remembered not for his policy switch on troops for NATO but for his
amazing achievements on the international scene.

<P>
   It is time to end the monkey business over the banana war.
</P>
<P>
   The World Trade Organization (WTO) ruled on Tuesday that the
United States may impose $191 million worth of duties on goods from
the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
   This is in response to special subsidies that the EU has given
to bananas grown in the former colonies of its member states.
</P>
<P>
   The EU has argued that the 14,000 or so banana farmers in the
Caribbean need this help while they develop new ways to earn a
living.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Leon Brittan, the Vice President of the European Commission,
has already said that the EU will appeal against this decision. But
the U.S. has the letter of the law on its side and the European
Union should learn to live with the decision.
</P>
<P>
   The behavior of the United States has certainly been bullying.
Its imposition of tariffs on Terry's Chocolate Oranges and Scottish
cashmere sweaters, among other EU goods, has been illegal and
unnecessarily aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   There is reason to think that the whole trade war has been
bought off the shelf by the U.S. banana lobby through donations to
the Democrats. But the U.S. is right on this occasion.
</P>
<P>
   The Europeans now need to negotiate, not appeal. It would be to
no one's benefit if the U.S. decided to impose the tariffs up to
the WTO limit.
</P>
<P>
   There is no reason why the WTO's decision should prevent the EU
helping the Caribbean islanders. It could increase the amount of
economic development aid it gives to the islands.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, with the future of the European Commission under
debate, it would be best if this matter could be sorted out before
Romano Prodi becomes its president.
</P>
<P>
   And with more people fleeing from Kosovo and the number of
deaths increasing daily, the Western allies do not need to be
wrangling over who is top banana. &QL;

   KOSOVO-NATO (Washington) _ President Clinton vows the NATO

</P>
<P>
   INVASION-SCENARIOS (Washington) _ Two concepts are emerging for
an allied ground-troop sweep into Yugoslavia. Under one, the main
invasion force would be about 40,000 NATO troops massed in Hungary
who would head south to encircle Belgrade. Under the other, the
main invasion would come from 14,000 NATO troops already stationed
in Macedonia and an equal number in Albania. By ERIC ROSENBERG.
</P>
<P>
   McCAIN (Washington) _ Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., has postponed
his announcement of his campaign for the presidency, saying it
would be inappropriate during a time of conflict. But the crisis in
Yugoslavia has been the best thing to happen to the only combat
veteran and former POW among announced or likely presidential
candidates. By BENNETT ROTH. (Already filed.)

inexpensive gasoline. A gallon of gasoline in Mexico costs about
twice as much as it does in the United States. By DANE SCHILLER.
</P>

   TEXAS-EXPLOSIVES (Houston) _ A Freeport, Texas, gang known as
the Vatos Locos (``Crazy Dudes'') planned to use stolen plastic

CALIFORNIA SEEKS TO CRACK DOWN ON VIDEO VOYEURS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Showing that no sexual fetish goes
unexploited by the Internet or unpunished by the Legislature,
California lawmakers have made video peeping the newest anti-crime
crusade.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 Web sites are devoted to so-called ``upskirt''
voyeurism, where people with tiny cameras hang out at shopping
malls, amusement parks and beaches to secretly videotape women's
underwear, lingerie, pantyhose or whatever.
</P>
<P>
   It's not illegal. State law prohibits looking ``through a hole
or opening into a bathroom, changing room or any other area where
someone has a reasonable expectation of privacy,'' but not looking
under someone's skirt in a public place.
</P>
<P>
   The police in Southern California have been forced to release
several men, including one who angled a concealed video camera
under the skirts of women waiting in line at Disneyland.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1996 Oakland case, the police could charge a man only with
eavesdropping on private conversations after he was caught
videotaping naked men in an athletic club locker room. The man
allegedly hid the video camera in a gym bag and would turn it on as
soon as he reached the club.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Dick Ackerman, a Republican, said these secret
videos and photographs were an ``offensive, disgusting practice,''
a blatant invasion of privacy and a crime directed mostly toward
women.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are literally thousands and thousands of women who have
had pictures taken either up their dress or down their blouse,''
Ackerman said. ``None of them, I'm sure, are aware of what's going
on and that people are making millions and millions of dollars at
it.''
</P>
<P>
   With little dissent, the Assembly Public Safety Committee on
Tuesday approved Ackerman's measure to outlaw such activity. Before
the vote, Ackerman passed out a list of Web sites that contained
amateur voyeurism, some containing explicit descriptions.
</P>
<P>
   Technological advances have allowed some cameras to be as small
as a pager or disguised in a water bottle or boom box.
</P>
<P>
   Voyeurs can film someone as they go up an escalator, or place a
bag with surveillance equipment under women's skirts while they're
waiting in a line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was truly shocked, truly shocked to hear about something
like this going on in my own county,'' said Republican
Assemblywoman Patricia Bates. ``As the mother of a young daughter,
it's particularly a threatening and intimidating invasion of
privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal law prohibits distribution of images of bestiality and
child pornography, but the U.S. Supreme Court last year threw out
the 1996 Communications Decency Act, which made it illegal to put
sexual material where children could find it. The court said the
law was too broad.
</P>
<P>
   Ackerman's original bill made the offense a felony, but he
amended it to reduce the penalty to a misdemeanor. The California
Attorneys for Criminal Justice had complained in a letter to
Ackerman that a felony conviction for video peeping might put
someone in prison for life under California's three- strikes
sentencing law.
</P>
<P>
   ``The penalties seem to be out of proportion to the offense,''
Steven Meinrath, a lobbyist for the group, wrote in February.
</P>
<P>
   The revised legislation makes the offense illegal only when the
photographer has the intent of ``arousing, appealing to, or
gratifying the lust, passions or sexual desires of that person.''

TENDER PERENNIALS ADD LIFE AND COLOR TO THE LONG HOT SUMMER 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MAC GRISWOLD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Garden fashion is fickle. It used to be perennials versus
annuals. Then it was pastels versus hot, read vulgar, colors. Now
that beginning gardeners have learned what a rhizome is, and red
and orange have been reborn as respectable garden colors, it's time
for another category of plants to elbow its way into the garden.
</P>
<P>
   Tender perennials (which survive year round in tropical zones
but not often in New England) bring color and texture to a garden
even in the heat of summer, when the garden droops. Many hardy
perennials like day lilies or peonies flower annually only for a
few weeks. By contrast, most tender perennials do their thing
exuberantly from May until October.
</P>
<P>
   They are the plants with tongue-twisting names that weave their
way through the border, that are the first to sprawl luxuriantly
from urns and pots, that can climb 10 to 20 feet in a season. Their
foliage can be feathery or bold, striped or fringed. Some of them,
like kangaroo paw (Anigozanthus manglesii), look like stuff only a
florist could have. Brugmansia, or angel's trumpet, has an
intoxicating fragrance.
</P>
<P>
   Many tender perennials have been offered as annuals in the
Northeast, though some, like Agastache rupestris, one of the giant
hyssops, a soft salmon-flowered, gray-leaved number, turn out to be
hardy in Zone 5, surprisingly far north.
</P>
<P>
   What the name tender perennial _ an English term _ points toward
is either a new mind-set or an attempt to convince gardeners that
they should pay perennial prices for plants that might well die off
in the cold. In either case, gardeners in the Northeast now seem
willing to take the risk. They may dig up the plants and lug them
indoors for the winter. More likely, they will treat tender
perennials like annuals, but plant them for the fireworks they
offer.
</P>
<P>
   The real roadblock for eager gardeners has been finding the
plants. Until very recently, they were almost impossible to buy at
garden centers stocked with six-packs of cactus-flowering zinnias.
Seed for Coleus Kiwi Fern, say, had to be ordered from specialty
companies and grown at home.
</P>
<P>
   This year, for the first time, there are two mail-order catalogs
that offer enough tender perennial plants to satisfy any color-mad
gardener. The Great Plant Co. sells tender perennials from Beds and
Borders, a wholesaler on Long Island. The company's prices start at
$14.50 for three easy-to-grow Salvia Indigo Spires,
4-to-6-foot-tall beauties with violet-blue flower spikes. Blue
Meadow Farm in Montague, Mass., grows its own plants and offers 29
pages of annuals and tender perennials.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Meadow Farm, in Zone 5, is at the coldest extreme for most
tender perennials. What survives the winter at the farm is noted in
the catalog and will be a reasonable bet for most of the Northeast.
Blue Meadow's prices run from $2.50 for a four-pack of an old
cottage garden favorite, corn cockle (Agrostemma githago Ocean
Pearls), which grows to three feet tall and is a great self-sower,
to $7.50 for a three-foot African rarity, Melianthus major, the
peanut butter plant, grown for its jagged, fuzzy foliage. (It
smells more acrid than nutty.)
</P>
<P>
   Steve Frowine, the president of the Great Plant Co., loves
tender perennials for what he calls the ``uninhibited carnival-like
atmosphere, like a vicarious vacation, that they provide.'' His
combination Blazing Sunset ($29) includes six plants that will fill
a 20-inch pot to overflowing by the end of June. The Great Plant
Co. offers them in four-inch plastic pots; $58 buys the plants and
an insulated Thermolite container that could pass for terra cotta.
</P>
<P>
   The top of the Great Plant Co. pot is frothy with rose-pink
Agastache Tutti-Frutti, a giant hyssop that will attract
hummingbirds. Off to one side is Petunia integrifolia TNT, whose
hot pink flowers are only one inch wide. It never ceases flowering
and never needs deadheading. (Shear it instead.) For gardeners in
Zone 7, which would include coastal Long Island and southern
Connecticut, this petunia self-sows.
</P>
<P>
   Front and center in the container is Coleus Alabama Sunset, a
rosy pink-and-yellow stunner. Coleus, of course, will shrivel at
the first frost. But it looks so wonderful, who can complain?
</P>
<P>
   Centaurea gymnocarpa is the other major focal point, with its
arching, deeply dissected white leaves. Alone among the plants in
this pot, it needs pinching to keep it in hand. Twining through its
long fronds is Alternanthera dentata Rubiginosa, which has deep
purple glossy ovate leaves. Below it are the little blue pleated
fan-shaped flowers of Scaevola aemula New Wonder.
</P>
<P>
   Those who are familiar with the work of Kathryn Pufahl,
celebrated for her balanced container combinations, will not be
surprised to find that the Great Plant Co.'s offerings come from
her wholesale establishment, Beds and Borders, 36,000 square feet
of greenhouse in Laurel, N.Y., on Long Island. Ms. Pufahl's eye and
determination have changed the face of summer gardening on the East
Coast. She pioneered the introduction of Petunia integrifolia and
the annual black sweet potato vine known as Blackie. And thanks to
her, there are now blue flowers available like the sky-colored
tweedia, Oxypetalum caeruleum, which twines through low plantings,
and the electric-blue Salvia guaranitica.
</P>
<P>
   Brian and Alice McGowan, the owners of Blue Meadow Farm, offer
all these and more. Forthright New Englanders and consummate
plantsmen that they are, they point out that most tender perennials
have only Latin names, which has been as much of a hurdle to public
acceptance as their doubtful hardiness.
</P>
<P>
   But then, who would not master Latin to have these plants?
</P>
<P>
   Tender perennials can be bought by mail order from the Great
Plant Co., Box 1041, New Hartford, Conn. 06057, (800) 441-9788, or

DIGITAL PINBALL WIZARDRY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Releasing the plunger and launching the silver ball into play.
Listening to the raucous sounds of points piling up. Snapping the
flippers to bat the ball up to the bumpers. Shooting at virtual
images? Pinball may never be the same.
</P>
<P>
   Pinball 2000, brought out last month by Williams Electronics
Games of Chicago, mixes decades-old pinball mechanics with the
latest digital three-dimensional technology. It has traditional
features but bolsters them with sensors and virtual images that
place the player in a video battle to save Earth from invading
Martians.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game is a major step forward,'' said Tim Arnold, a member
of the important-sounding Las Vegas Pinball Collector's Club, which
Arnold described as a bunch of guys hanging out and having fun.
``Pinball used to be about a ball on a painted surface. Now it's a
ball in the middle of a movie,'' he said, ``with a plot and
graphics and video.''
</P>
<P>
   Pinball 2000 looks pretty much like most other arcade games on
the outside, but it uses a video monitor to produce 3-D images that
are reflected off the glass surface of the playing table. ``The
mind combines the reflection with the playing field beneath it,''
explained John Popadiuk, the game designer who headed the team that
developed Pinball 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The design started with the traditional mechanical features:
flippers, bumpers, targets and a ball. (The ball has been an
industry standard since 1934: 3 ounces of chrome steel, 1.063
inches in diameter.)
</P>
<P>
   A series of optic and magnetic sensors track the ball as it
caroms around the playing field. The system's heart is a
200-megahertz motherboard, flash memory and software. The computer
coordinates the moving parts of the game with the 3-D images of
Martians, spaceships, rockets and buildings to produce an
interactive effect.
</P>
<P>
   One traditional feature is even completely virtual in the game _
the spinner, the panel that rotates when the ball hits it. Sensors
imbedded in the playing field time the trajectory of the ball,
Popadiuk said. As the ball shoots under the spinner's projected
image, it makes it rotate like the real thing. Even though the ball
never hits anything physical, the virtual spinner racks up points.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the ball ``hits'' hundreds of other virtual images in
the game. When real stand-up targets in the playing field behind
the virtual images are hit, the computer launches a rocket or
destroys a bright green Martian. ``The physical design of the game
is simple because the virtual images provide the complexity,''
Popadiuk said.
</P>
<P>
   Players of Pinball 2000 work their way through several scenes,
or levels, including ones in which they are saving the White House
or Paris. The ultimate level is an attack on Mars.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, which has made pinball machines under its name and the
Bally label for 52 years, is selling the game to arcades and
distributors. Fanatics who must have one in their home should be
ready to shell out about $5,000. But it will still cost only 50
cents for three balls at an arcade. Williams has more information
on its Web site (www.pinball2000.com).
</P>
<P>
   Arnold, who restores pinball machines and keeps his collection
of almost 1,000 in an empty aircraft hanger, won a scoring contest
when Pinball 2000 had a premiere in Las Vegas. ``It's very
juvenile, with lots of gratuitous violence and things blowing up,''
he said. ``I really enjoyed it.''

   If you feed a dollar into a machine and it obstinately spits it
back at you _no matter how carefully you smooth away the tiny folds
and wrinkles _ chances are you're nowhere near a Las Vegas casino.
In their ongoing efforts to separate fools from their money, casino
operators been among the first to adopt the latest bill validator
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, it may seem at times as if the bill acceptors in
vending and change machines were devised by the Treasury gods to
torture mere mortals. In fact, the devices exist to bogus bills.
dollar bill is guilty until proven innocent.
</P>
<P>
   Bill acceptors were developed in the late 1960s primarily to
make it easier to sell sodas and candy bars from vending machines.
It's no accident that one of the leading global suppliers of the
devices, Mars Electronics International, began life as a division
of the Mars candy company.
</P>
<P>
   The first generation of machines used a magnetic head, like
those in audio cassette players, to read the ink on a dollar bill.
But the magnetic heads needed to be in contact with the bill and
would frequently become fouled with grime and lint. The process was
possible because the ink used by the Treasury has a high iron
content _ but so does the ink in some copy machines. As recently as
six or seven years ago, it was relatively easy to trick a dollar
machine with a black-and-white photocopy.
</P>
<P>
   ``People fool bill validators with things that would not fool
humans,'' explained Tom Shuren, director of engineering at Mars
Electronics International. Newer magnetic readers float above the
surface of the bill and can distinguish between copier ink and
Treasury ink by measuring not just the magnetic field but the
pattern of magnetic particles within the ink, which serve as a sort
of fingerprint.
</P>
<P>
   Another popular scam involved attaching a string or piece of
tape to the back of a bill, enabling a thief to pull it out of the
machine once it was recognized.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these thieves could unload $500 from a changer in a
matter of minutes,'' said Tom Reynolds, president of Cointrol, a
major distributor of dollar changers. Most devices today have a
sensor that looks for foreign objects attached to the back of a
bill. To foil sophisticated thieves, bill acceptors began using
optical sensors in the early `90s sometimes in tandem with magnetic
sensors, microprocessors and computer programs that analyze
multiple frequencies of light passing through bills.
</P>
<P>
   These devices analyze the shadows cast by various parts of a
bill. Each sensor focuses on specific spots in a narrow swath of
the bill as it passes by. (Precisely which parts of the bill are
looked at cannot be revealed so as not to abet counterfeiters.)
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most advanced machines come from the Cash Code
company of Concord, Ontario. Among the employees giving Cash Code a
competitive edge are a group of Russian emigre engineers who once
worked on the Soviet missile and space programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a never-ending game _ as we develop new methods of
detecting fakes, counterfeiters develop new methods,'' said Val
Levitan, senior vice president of marketing at Cash Code. Levitan
said Cash Code had applied for patents on new devices that would be
available later this year. They employ capacitive, or dielectric,
sensors, which measure conductivity and can detect phony watermarks
or fake identifying threads in counterfeit bills.
</P>
<P>
   The more recent models of bill validators are also much more
flexible. When the new $20 bills came out, many older machines
would not accept the bills and had to be scrapped or undergo costly
retrofitting, with the installation of new chips. The latest
machines, however, can be ``flash'' upgraded: a technician merely
downloads the new software program from a laptop.
</P>
<P>
   To make sure that an advanced bill validator can read slightly
tattered, faded or soiled bills, employees artificially age bills
by wrinkling them, passing them hand to hand and even running them
through a washing machine. Machines are then calibrated to accept
these less than perfect bills. The industry standard is an
acceptance rate of 96 percent. If your corner Pepsi machine appears
to have a much lower rate, it is probably an older machine or is
not serviced regularly. ``You don't experience as many problems
when you are in Vegas because they have service technicians on the
spot,'' Levitan said. ``They have those machines up and running in
minutes.''

CHAOS AND SENTIMENT FRAME THE TODDLERS' CLASS PICTURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY BINGHAM 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ When little Sydney Stegint makes her first
million, people will want to see this picture. The same thing will
happen when Wade Westerheide gets drafted by the Texas Rangers and
when Hayden Redmon is elected to the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``People'' magazine will want their class picture.
</P>
<P>
   That's how it works. We all have them taken, we all forget them.
We shove them under a bed until, years later, we get sentimental or
somebody does something famous.
</P>
<P>
   By then, we have forgotten how they came together. We have
forgotten the Doris Atwoods who combed our hair, the Merci Henrys
who tucked in our shirt, the Bebe Behelers who wiped our noses.
</P>
<P>
   This story is about how they pull it off. It isn't always a
pretty picture.
</P>
<P>
   We're inside University United Methodist Child Development
Center in Fort Worth. It's near 9 a.m. on a Thursday morning. The
photographer is coming.
</P>
<P>
   Till Hezel arrives with white umbrellas, giant lights, much
commotion and Mr. Mouse, an 8-year-old, fur-covered, glass-eyed
squeaky thing he bought at a photographers' convention. ``Where
else?''
</P>
<P>
   Picture Day comes to University four times a year: Portraits in
the fall, on a pony in winter, all together in April, with a teddy
bear in late spring. The center's director is a picture person.
</P>
<P>
   Beheler has every class picture her 13-year-old daughter has
ever taken, including the one from the year she tripped and had to
be photographed with a fat lip. Beheler bought it anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Parents are like that. So we find teachers Atwood and Henry
improvising the activities in the 2-year-olds' room. They stay away
from markers, Play-Doh and sand. Keeping a kid clean; that's the
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   The salt table is safe. So are Mr. Potato Head, the ``dress-up''
clothes, the jungle gym, construction paper and colored tape. The
clock ticks, the teachers watch. They break up a fight over the Sit
'N Spin.
</P>
<P>
   They have heard that the toddlers are going first. It's usually
the infants, but somebody's mother is late, so mixed reports come
down the hall. Snack time arrives. Peanut butter is out of the
question. Today, it's crackers.
</P>
<P>
   Then it's their turn. They wander down the hall past the
cotton-ball bunnies on the toddlers' door, past the paper Easter
baskets on the wall, into Room 114.
</P>
<P>
   The children stand around the giant lights like moths. Their
teachers swoop: Atwood rakes every little head, combing hair. Henry
brushes off cracker crumbs and stuffs in shirttails. Another
teacher yanks the ``dress-up'' apron away from the future
millionaire. The photographer lines them up.
</P>
<P>
   Wait! Beheler spies a dirty nose.
</P>
<P>
   Wait! He's still dirty. The someday U.S. senator flinches under
a second scrub. Hezel waits with Mr. Mouse.
</P>
<P>
   Then all of a sudden, just like that, it's over.
</P>
<P>
   The children leave, and Beheler sits. There's a touch of
perspiration on her brow. Hezel sits beside her. She tells him she
has a book in her office of every class picture taken since she's
been director. She gets sentimental.
</P>
<P>
   ``They change so fast.'' She wipes her brow.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, you never get those times back.''

<P>
   The research library of today presents a comforting image: cool
marble stairs, orderly rows of volumes, a familiar, musty scent.
But gradually, as computer work stations replace stacks and the
clack-clacking of keyboards is heard above hushed voices, that
image is becoming a quaint reminder of a closing era.
</P>
<P>
   Research libraries, of course, are the warehouses of collective
scholarly memory, and librarians take seriously their obligation to
preserve academic material for future generations. Increasingly,
research materials are being added to collections in digital form,
through things like subscriptions to electronic journals.
</P>
<P>
   And a consequence of this technological wave is a persistent
debate over how the library materials will be preserved to create
the archives of the future.
</P>
<P>
   The problem of preserving digital collections is complex and
vexing. First, there is the question of what hardware and software
to use. Digital archives are more vulnerable than their paper
counterparts. Not only do both computer hardware and software
quickly become obsolete, but the durability of magnetic storage
media, like tapes and disks, is limited.
</P>
<P>
   The storage issue cannot be resolved without considering the
question of ownership. Digital material is often not acquired by
libraries in the same way that paper material is, because libraries
often buy access to digital data housed on computers elsewhere.
That raises thorny legal and economic questions about who is
responsible for preservation.
</P>
<P>
   Reports and discussions on archiving and preserving digital
collections abound. ``We talk about it every day,'' said Ann
Okerson, associate university librarian at Yale University. ``Every
minute of every day.'' Still, no one has come up with a clear
solution.
</P>
<P>
   Digital collections are growing more quickly than many
librarians anticipated. In a study published last December and
commissioned by the Research Libraries Group, a consortium of 160
research institutions worldwide, nearly every library that
responded said it was handling electronic material or expected to
be within three years. But the survey also showed that the
libraries were not sure about how to preserve digital materials to
insure their availability in the future even as such materials
become a larger part of their holdings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know libraries haven't stepped up to figure out how to do
it,'' said Donald Waters, director of the Digital Library
Federation, an alliance of large research libraries. ``We have to
solve this problem in order to move forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the problem is the fact that much of the digital
information that libraries license resides on servers maintained by
publishers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fees we pay are mostly fees for access to online resources
maintained elsewhere,'' Ms. Okerson said. ``If it crashed, we'd be
in deep trouble. I don't know what we'd do. It's pretty sobering.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Okerson said that when she bought an electronic subscription
these days, she asked a series of questions: ``Will there be an
archive in perpetuity? Is whoever is creating these resources
committed to that, and how will I get at that information over
time? What will it take? Those are the big questions, and I don't
see many answers out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Electronic materials are a growing part of library budgets.
Yale, for example, spent just under $1 million last year on
electronic journals, called e-journals, and on databases and
reference services, double what it was spending three years ago.
That represents about 8 percent of its library acquisitions budget.
</P>
<P>
   But the digital age has also radically changed the nature of
library purchases. A library does not generally put its electronic
purchases on its shelves for perpetuity, as it would with a
reference book or issues of a scholarly journal. Most online
purchases come in the form of licenses. That means libraries buy
the right to look at something that has a permanent home on
somebody else's computer.
</P>
<P>
   Although licensing contracts vary, journal publishers generally
allow each reader at an institution with a license to read or
download material for personal use but not for wide distribution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ownership versus non-ownership takes you into one of the
hearts of the archiving problem,'' Ms. Okerson said. ``I don't know
how you can preserve something you don't own.''
</P>
<P>
   Many libraries now subscribe to journals in both print and
electronic form, which drives up their costs but gives them a sense
of security. But resources ranging from indexing services to
electronic journals are increasingly ``born digital,'' as a
Web-based scientific paper, say, or an electronic database.
</P>
<P>
   Librarians are mindful of the fact that materials born digital
have tremendous advantages for scholars. A Web-based research
article, for example, is filled with easily accessible links to
other documents, known in the hard-copy realm of scholarship as
references.
</P>
<P>
   Documents that are filled with links pose yet another
preservation problem because keeping an electronic research paper
vital and relevant means keeping its links alive. But as anyone who
has spent time on the ever-changing World Wide Web can confirm,
there is little guarantee that today's healthy link will not be
tomorrow's ``requested object does not exist on this server''
message.
</P>
<P>
   An increasing number of Web-based electronic research papers
also contain still or video images or sound. That could easily be a
problem if, for instance, the current technology for listening to
sound and viewing images alters drastically.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we increasingly as scholars rely on various digital
resources and those aren't preserved, we won't have that kind of
accountability and trail of how research develops,'' said Margaret
Hedstrom, an associate professor at the School of Information at
the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor. ``It's both the loss of
the information and the whole validation of scholarship. Those are
the implications of not solving this problem.''
</P>
<P>
   As questions about ownership and the use of these resources are
being resolved, librarians must also consider the question of what
storage medium to choose. It is not a simple matter of putting
documents onto a CD-ROM, partly because storage media change
relatively rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   One approach is called migration, a term that is used broadly to
describe several different methods for transferring digital
information from old technology to new technology.

WORK WOULD SOLVE JEFF BECK'S CASH-FLOW PROBLEM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's hard to feel sorry for Jeff Beck.
</P>
<P>
   Now 54, Beck long ago earned his place in the pantheon of great
rock guitarists. He was in the Yardbirds, one of the most important
rock groups ever; he can still play like nobody's business; and
he's still popular enough to headline large American venues.
</P>
<P>
   But Jeff Beck's lot, we're told, is a tough one. It seems ol'
Jeff is running short on money, something he has mentioned in
numerous interviews to promote his latest CD, ``Who Else!'' He says
that his financial future is not stable, and that as far back as
his 1995 tour with Santana, he was desperate for money.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, he's proud of the new CD (which he should be), but
if it tanks he's going to be in some serious trouble _ for a rock
star, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   What caused these financial woes? Drugs? Unscrupulous
management?
</P>
<P>
   Um, no.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Beck is broke because Jeff Beck spent much of the past, oh,
19 years ``not working very much.'' ``Who Else!'' is only his fifth
solo CD since 1980, and his tours have been even more sporadic.
</P>
<P>
   I remember one interview he gave to ``Musician'' 10 or so years
ago: The writer went to Beck's centuries-old mansion in the English
countryside, where he found the musician puttering away on one of
his fleet of antique cars. Beck said he was not really that
interested in making music any.MDNM/more, didn't need it, didn't
much care, and would be happy under a car hood for the rest of his
life.
</P>
<P>
   About the time Beck was seriously slacking off, his peer Steve
Winwood was embarking on one of the biggest comebacks in rock
history. Like Beck, Winwood first became popular during the
mid-'60s. He recorded several classic records with Traffic, but
after that group broke up in 1974, he released only one solo LP.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly broke, he put out ``Arc of a Diver'' in 1981, recasting
himself as a more contemporary, R&AMP;B-drenched pop-rocker. It worked:
The record was a major hit, and he followed it with four CDs (and
as many tours) in nine years. And suddenly, Steve Winwood was a
very rich man. Amazing what a little effort can do.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling Beck's old attitude _ and how Winwood dusted himself
off _ it's hard to work up much sympathy for Beck's current woes.
At the dawn of the '80s, with several popular jazz-fusion LPs
recently behind him, he could easily have continued to tour and
record regularly, thereby keeping at least a large percentage of
his fan base and assuring himself a steady income.
</P>
<P>
   And even if he couldn't earn the sort of money a Mick Jagger or
an Eric Clapton could, he was certainly going to make one heck of a
lot more than you or I could make.
</P>
<P>
   He chose not to, and he paid the price in lost income and lost
fans. Very few people can go away indefinitely without experiencing
lower CD sales and fewer people showing up at their shows. It's
just human nature: If you aren't there, I'll listen to someone who
is.
</P>
<P>
   Now, nobody is saying that had Jeff Beck paid more attention to
his career he'd fill arenas at up to $300 per ticket, but then
again, he probably wouldn't be whining about his shaky bank
account, either.
</P>
<P>
   Say this for the Stones _ and Rod Stewart, and Sting, and
Aerosmith, and plenty of other veterans: They work. Hard. Year
after year, they get out there, recording and touring.
</P>
<P>
   The Stones, in fact, have been touring since the fall of 1997 _
not bad for a bunch of old guys who have millions in the bank.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, that's WHY they have millions in the bank. They earned
it. .MDNM/ (Visit the Star-Telegram's online services on the World

 UNDATED: new technology.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Migration can be as simple as transferring data from an older
storage medium to new storage formats,'' Dr. Hedstrom said, ``like
the transfer from seven- to nine-track tapes during the 1960s, or
the transfer from nine-track tapes to tape cartridges during the
1980s and 1990s.''
</P>
<P>
   The process of migration grows more complicated when the
information that is transferred cannot be retrieved or used without
specific software. If documents created by an obsolete word
processing program cannot run on a newer system, then the documents
are converted to newer formats. A number of digital archives both
in and outside academia have already been preserved in this way.
</P>
<P>
   But some experts say migration has limitations. ``We can keep
the old stuff alive, but the problem is that that means
translation, and translation is always going to lose something,''
said Jeff Rothenberg, a senior computer scientist at the Rand Corp.
who has written widely on the topic of preserving digital archives.
</P>
<P>
   Rothenberg pointed out that migration means converting every
document in a collection every time the software that created it or
the hardware that can read it becomes outdated. ``You will have to
spend effort and energy and time every time you go through one of
these migrations,'' he said, ``because if you don't, and a document
is needed two years later, it's gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the migration approach is ``better then nothing,''
Rothenberg added, it is labor-intensive and very expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Rothenberg favors a method called emulation; under that policy,
libraries would continue to store documents in their original
forms, along with the original software that created them, and
software would be created to allow a more advanced machine to mimic
the obsolete hardware. With emulation, for instance, documents
created with Word Perfect 2.0, which ran on the DOS operating
system, would remain stored as is and an emulation program would
allow a future machine to read the documents.
</P>
<P>
   Emulation, Rothenberg said, is a tried and true technique in the
computer industry for other purposes. Anyone who has installed a
copy of Virtual PC on a Macintosh to run software written for the
Windows operating system has experienced emulation first-hand.
</P>
<P>
   But whether emulation will work for preservation is still
unproven. ``We've emulated old computers on newer computers,'' he
said, ``but we haven't designed an emulator for a current machine
that's supposed to run on a future machine we haven't designed yet.
That makes people skeptical.''
</P>
<P>
   To assess the feasibility of emulation would require an intense
effort by computer scientists, Rothenberg said. But there seems to
be little interest in such research. Rothenberg is one of only a
few computer scientists looking for solutions to the problems of
digital preservation.
</P>
<P>
   Emulation turns out to be a very difficult computer science
problem, Rothenberg said. ``Unfortunately computer scientists
haven't gotten very excited about it,'' he explained. ``It just
hasn't caught the attention of the community yet. What computer
scientists do not like to do much is look into the past, because
that isn't very exciting. But we should be excited by dealing with
the past by looking into the future.''
</P>
<P>
   A low-tech solution would be to print all digital documents, but
Rothenberg is not impressed with that suggestion, calling such a
plan little more than a ``rear-guard action.''
</P>
<P>
   He also dismissed what he called the ``computer museum''
approach, which would call for libraries to accumulate rooms filled
with obsolete equipment for reading old documents.
</P>
<P>
   Waters, of the Digital Library Federation, said he believed that
a palette of preservation tools would eventually emerge, based on
the concepts of emulation and migration and on what he called
``archaeology,'' the use of various techniques to recover lost
data.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bunch of different problems so it will be a bunch of
different solutions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   More work will be required up front to insure a collection's
longevity, he said, adding, ``Librarians will work with creators so
they create documents that will last.''

   MIDSHIPMAN-SEX &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Birk Billingsley's first love was the U.S.
Naval Academy, and his second, more recent, love was a freshman in
his squad. Now the 22-year-old Texan's affair with the academy
could be nearing an end because he broke the rules by having an
``unduly familiar'' relationship with Kristina Shiroma, an
underclassman also from Texas. The two have been expelled from the

ACCESSIBLE VIA MODEM, THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By IRVIN MOLOTSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In 1990, James Billington, the librarian of
Congress, persuaded Congress to provide the first $1 million to
start building a national library without walls.
</P>
<P>
   The idea then was to duplicate much of the Library of Congress'
huge holdings in electronic form so people in other parts of the
country could have access to the material without traveling to
Washington or even leaving home.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, said Laura Campbell, a Library of Congress
official, the only media suitable to the task were the video disk
and the CD-ROM.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not in the distribution business,'' Ms. Campbell said.
``How could we get this out?''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Ms. Campbell said, those were ``the days before the
Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   By 1994, the World Wide Web had evolved, making it easy for even
casual computer users to gain access to information on the
Internet. The Library of Congress saw it as the answer and sought
contributions to help put its holdings on line.
</P>
<P>
   The library solicited a donation from David Packard, the
co-founder of Hewlett-Packard, who knows something of computers.
``He said he loved the idea of getting this information out,'' Ms.
Campbell said. ``He gave us our first $5 million.''
</P>
<P>
   Metromedia chairman John Kluge gave $5 million, and the W.K.
Kellogg Foundation contributed $3 million. The $13 million in
donations gave the Library of Congress such a jump start that it
has reached its goal of raising $45 million for the project from
the private sector, while Congress has added $15 million.
</P>
<P>
   The gateway to the collection, which is stored on a server at
the library, is the Library of Congress' American Memory site
(memory.loc.gov/ammem/amhome.html). It drew 132,000 unique
visitors, or people who went to the site at least once, during
February, said a spokeswoman for Media Metrix, an Internet
measurement company. By comparison, the Library of Congress' main
government page, Thomas (thomas.loc.gov), which provides access to
every part of the federal government, got 249,000 unique visitors
that month, according to Media Metrix.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our competitive strength,'' Ms. Campbell said, ``is that we
have these unique and rare treasures to offer.''
</P>
<P>
   A person skimming through the offerings the other day clicked
into World War I material. First there was a recording of George M.
Cohan's ``Over There,'' sung by Billy Murray in 1917.
</P>
<P>
   Then came a recording from the U.S. commander in France, Gen.
John J. Pershing, who recorded a 33-second speech called ``From the
Battlefields of France'' in which he said:
</P>
<P>
   ``Three thousand miles from home, an American army is fighting
for you. Everything you hold worthwhile is at stake. Only the
hardest blows can win against the enemy we are fighting. Invoking
the spirit of our forefathers, the army asks your unshrinking
support, to the end that the high ideals for which America stands
may endure upon the earth.''
</P>
<P>
   From there, it was easy to navigate to a collection of World War
I photographs, one of them showing a German zeppelin brought down
in an English field.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Campbell, who is director of the library's National Digital
Library and directs a staff of 100 people, said there were now 1.7
million items on the Web site. The goal is to have 5 million by
next year, the library's bicentennial.
</P>
<P>
   The eventual target is to make available 80 million items from
the Library of Congress' collection that cannot be easily obtained
elsewhere. A complete set of Mark Twain is available at just about
every American library, so books like that will not be made
available on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   What will be made available are materials like the earliest
movies and sound recordings, maps, manuscripts, the papers of 23
presidents and photographs. Fragile rare books are also being put
online; less handling means that they will probably last longer.
Theft from libraries is also reduced when users go digital.
</P>
<P>
   One such rare item is Ralph Waldo Emerson's 1855 letter praising
Walt Whitman's ``Leaves of Grass,'' in which the established
Emerson called the little-known Whitman's work ``the most
extraordinary piece of wit and wisdom that America has yet
contributed,'' according to the site.
</P>
<P>
   Without asking permission, Whitman used Emerson's testimonial in
advertising for later editions of his collection of poetry,
including some in which he added erotic elements. Emerson was not
pleased, the entry adds.
</P>
<P>
   With the Library of Congress site, a teacher of a history course
on the American Revolution will be able to have students study not
only the final Declaration of Independence but also an earlier
draft by Thomas Jefferson with corrections in the margin by
Benjamin Franklin and John Adams.
</P>
<P>
   The American Memory site has Civil War photographs by Matthew
Brady and others (a picture taken by Alexander Gardner shows
Confederate dead at Antietam in 1862), the earliest authenticated
daguerreotype portrait of Abraham Lincoln (taken by Nicholas H.
Sheperd in 1846 or 1847), turn-of-the-century films of New York
street scenes (in one a horse-drawn fire engine races around a
corner) and Alexander Graham Bell's 1876 sketch of the telephone,
without which none of this would be possible.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The shift from video disk and CD-ROM to the Internet has also
meant that the Library of Congress has been able to shift its
potential electronic audience from schools, universities and school
libraries to the desk of any person with a computer and modem.
</P>
<P>
   The Library of Congress can get its material in the most
unexpected ways. A collection of early baseball cards, which can be
seen on the American Memory site, was gathered by Benjamin K.
Edwards, who left it to his daughter, who gave it to the poet Carl
Sandburg, who donated it to the library.
</P>
<P>
   The Edwards collection includes 2,100 baseball cards, produced
from 1887 to 1914, and depicts the likes of Ty Cobb, Cy Young,
Connie Mack, Walter Johnson and Christy Mathewson. In those days,
most of the cards were distributed with cigarettes and were used
for both advertising and for stiffening the packages.
</P>
<P>
   To spread the word, the Library of Congress has begun a program
to show teachers how to use its collection in their classrooms. The
program, called American Memory Fellows, sends 50 teachers to
Washington for a week each summer and trains them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They agree to spend six weeks on line before coming here,''
Ms. Campbell said, ``and then give a commitment to continue to work
with us and make primary sources available in the classroom.''
</P>
<P>
   The teachers who have participated in the program's first two
years, Ms. Campbell said, ``are spreading the word'' about the
library on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Veccia, project manager for the National Digital Library,
said that the fellows for this year had been selected already. ``If
money is available, we will have it in years ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Information about applying for the fellowships can be obtained
by selecting the Learning Page on the American Memory home page and
then clicking on Educators' Program.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how the fellows were chosen, Ms. Veccia said that the
Library of Congress sought teachers ``who come with an idea of how
they are going to use it, who have some facility with the
technology _ we really can't be teaching technology skills at this
point _ and who are leaders in their fields.''
</P>
<P>
   The fellowship pays for transportation to Washington and
accommodations while here.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Veccia said here was not a clear picture of how much of the
Internet was being used in the classroom for educational purposes
and how much the Internet was simply being used to exchange e-mail
messages.
</P>
<P>
   Besides its own collection, the Library of Congress plans to put
other institutions' materials on the American Memory site. It has
received $2 million from Ameritech to start doing this with
material from the New-York Historical Society (which has provided
its Civil War collection) and the Chicago Historical Society (the
holder of the archives of The Chicago Daily News, a defunct
newspaper with a notable sports collection).
</P>
<P>
   For most of its 200 years, the Library of Congress has been
notable for its collection of books. Does this emphasis on
electronic media mark a basic shift in emphasis?
</P>
<P>
   No, answered Robert Zich, the director of the project's
electronic programs, it is really a way to whet the appetite.
Speaking of the Librarian of Congress, he said, ``Billington's goal
is to drive kids back to the libraries and reading books.''

 &HT;    
 By STEPHEN L. COHEN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    From coast to coast, a growing tide of dissatisfaction is
sweeping through the medical marketplace. Complaints against HMOs
and other health insurers are on the rise, and doctors and patients
across the country are registering their displeasure with a
managed-care system gone awry.
 &HT;    Somehow, just four years after ``Harry and Louise'' helped
trounce President Clinton's plans for healthcare reform, the public
is fuming over, well ... healthcare reform.
 &HT;    You remember Harry and Louise: the affable all-American couple
fraught with concern about the Clinton health plan and its promise
to introduce the dreaded M-word to American medicine. In a series
of national television ads, they shared their fears about the
perils of managed care with the public, cringing at the thought of
medical spending caps and a government healthcare bureaucracy.
 &HT;    The congenial pair appeared in a $17-million media campaign
funded by the Health Insurance Association of America. Their
mission was simple: to frighten the public into opposing the
Clinton plan by dwelling on the negative aspects of managed care.
 &HT;    It was an easy task. All they had to do was focus attention on
the reduction in health services that would accompany any effort to
rein in the nation's skyrocketing medical costs. Then they could
blame these sacrifices on the Clinton plan.
 &HT;    What Harry and Louise didn't mention was that some form of
restrictions -- or healthcare rationing -- was inevitable if we
were to avoid bankrupting the country. The nation simply couldn't
afford unlimited medical spending, which was already consuming
about 14 percent of our national economic output.
 &HT;    So in 1993, the president assembled some of the best minds in
the country in order to come up with a solution to the problem. The
result of their labors was the Clinton health plan.
 &HT;    Although the plan faced opposition from multiple constituencies
-- including the Chamber of Commerce and the National Association
of Manufacturers -- the HIAA, a trade group representing health
insurers, spent more on broadcast ads than any other group involved
in the debate. In the end, they succeeded in derailing the Clinton
plan, using two actors (whose names really were Harry and Louise)
to touch a chord in the American psyche.
 &HT;    Unfortunately, that chord still reverberates.
 &HT;    The irony is that the issues that rattled Harry and Louise are
the same issues that people are complaining about today. The only
difference is that now, instead of blaming the government, they're
blaming the new ``bad guys'': the HMOs. What the public is missing
in all this is the simple fact that somebody has to be the bad guy.
If we're to keep the country solvent, someone has to do the dirty
work of cutting medical expenses -- there's only so much money in
the pot, and we can't afford to pay for everything everyone wants
in terms of medical services.
 &HT;    So why are people still complaining?
 &HT;    Because when it comes to health care, the public has yet to come
to terms with a basic rule of economics: you can't spend more than
you've got. We recognize this reality in other sectors of the
economy, but medicine is often treated as if it's exempt from the
laws of economics because it deals with the sanctity of human
lives.
 &HT;    Yet even in life-and-death situations, someone has to pay the
bill. And the bill keeps getting larger.
 &HT;    This is why some form of rationing is inevitable. Indeed, we're
already rationing health care -- by denying health insurance
benefits to 40 million Americans, for example, we're greatly
reducing their access to medical services. We have the ability to
provide universal coverage, of course, but we'd have to allocate
billions of dollars to pay for it. Thus far, the nation has chosen
spend its healthcare dollars elsewhere.
 &HT;    Insured patients must also deal with the rationing of medical
services. When HMOs set limits for hospital stays, for instance,
they're rationing access to inpatient care. The same is true when
they require pre-certification for surgical procedures, allowing
coverage for some procedures and denying it for others.
 &HT;    Largely as a result of such controls, physicians and patients
are filing numerous complaints to state regulators over issues like
fee disputes and denial of care. But a more ominous sign is
emerging as well. Whereas complaints in the past tended to focus on
who would pay for a given medical service, insurance regulators
report that now it's a matter of whether the service is provided at
all.
 &HT;    While adapting to this restrictive environment, patients must
also contend with the fact that medical rationing is occurring in a
haphazard fashion. This is precisely what the Clinton
administration sought to avoid by developing a comprehensive
healthcare reform plan in 1993. It was an enormous undertaking, and
the plan represented the most significant effort undertaken so far
to reform our troubled healthcare system.
 &HT;    But it never had much of a chance, largely because it had to
reconcile the needs of too many different interest groups with
conflicting priorities.
 &HT;    Harry and Louise also did their part, misleading the public by
acting as if the hard choices could be avoided with a laissez-faire
approach to the healthcare problem. That helped kill the Clinton
plan, and it stopped the government from addressing a critical
issue.
 &HT;    Still, the situation isn't a total loss. Today, the perky couple
is probably at the head of the pack complaining about the cost
controls and spending caps imposed by their former employers in the
insurance industry.

   Thanks to classes in public schools and programs sponsored by
community organizations, it's rare to find a disabled child or
teen-ager who hasn't logged onto a computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every child with a special need will be involved with
computers one way or another,'' said Bridget Lyne, managing editor
of Exceptional Parent magazine (www.eparent.com). ``The learning
possibilities, I couldn't even begin to quantify.''
</P>
<P>
   The magazine, published since 1971 as a guide for parents of
children or young adults with disabilities or health problems, has
increased its focus on technology in the past few years. A
four-part series that started in November and covered learning
software and adaptive devices can be ordered from the magazine at

every January and is available in bookstores or through the
magazine for $12, also lists technology resources. Ms. Lyne
recommends checking with local public schools or night-school
programs to see if they offer technology classes.

   Goodwill Industries International (www.goodwill.org) offers
computer training and job-skills classes at about 100 offices in
the United States, said Christine Nyirjesy Bragale, a Goodwill
spokeswoman. The classes vary in price. To find the closest local
office, call (800) 664-6577.

 HOME IMPROVEMENT QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

<P>
   Q: I am building a large rectangular shaped desk and the
two-inch thick top will have rounded corners. I plan to cover this
top with Formica and I also want to cover the edges with the same
plastic laminate, using a regular contact cement. Should I apply
the laminate to the edges or the top first, and how do I handle
bending the edge strips around the curved corners without having to
use clamps to hold the strips in place?
</P>
<P>
   A: Apply the laminate to the edges first. Cut each strip about
1/2 inch wider than the edge of the top so that the plastic will be
wide enough to overlap the top and bottom edges of the core
material by about 1/4 inch. Apply two coats of contact cement to
the edge of the core material (two coats are usually needed because
edges are more porous) and one coat to the back of the Formica
strip. Allow each coat to dry for about 30 minutes, then press the
plastic strip in place against the edge so it sticks up about 1/4
inch above the top surface. When you get to the curved corners use
a heat gun set at `LOW' to heat the Formica and make it more
pliable (wear gloves to protect your hands). Use a hard rubber
roller to press it firmly against the edge and insure a good bond,
then use a flat file or router to trim off excess plastic that
sticks up above and below the core material.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We are planning to paint the outside of our house and will
have to use a tall extension ladder to reach the higher portions.
The problem is that most of the ground around the base of the house
is bare soil around flower beds and bushes, so I am nervous about
my husband using the ladder when it is resting on this ground. Is
there some way to do this safely?
</P>
<P>
   A: Climbing a tall ladder always involves a certain amount of
danger, but it can be safe if you avoid working on windy or wet
days, and if reasonable precautions are taken. When necessary to
set the ladder up on soft soil, place a wide, one-inch-thick board
or piece of 3/4 inch plywood down first, then set the legs of the
ladder on top of this. For additional safety drive a heavy peg or
short length of pipe into the ground about one or two feet behind
the ladder, then lash the bottom rung of the ladder to this peg in
order to keep the ladder from slipping off the board.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Our cabinets are made of some kind of molded plastic and have
a simulated wood grain finish that has begun to wear off in several
places. I decided to paint them and tried applying an off-white
latex paint on one of the panels, but the paint didn't seem to bond
very well. Is there a special type of paint I should be using?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's possible that the trouble is not just with the type
paint used, but also with the preparation of the old surface. Scrub
thoroughly with a good household detergent, then sand with a medium
grit paper and scrape off any old finish that is not adhering
tightly. Apply a first coat of a shellac-based sealer and primer
such as BIN to insure a good bond, then paint with two coats of
semi-gloss enamel. I would recommend an alkyd paint, rather than a
latex.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The wrought iron railings on each side of our entrance stoop
are peeling and showing a lot of rust. What should I do before
repainting them, and what can I do to prevent further rusting?
</P>
<P>
   A: Use a wire brush and coarse steel wool to scrape off as much
of the old paint and loose rust as you can. Then wipe down with
mineral spirits or similar solvent and apply a coat of rust
converter (sold in paint and hardware stores). This converts the
rust to a solid oxide that also forms an excellent base for
painting over _ and it helps prevent further rusting. After this
dries, paint with two coats of a rust-preventative metal enamel
that is especially designed for protecting against rust.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine yourself a European pilgrim garbed in heavy wool robes.
At day's end, you find an inn run by Trappist monks. You're offered
communal warmth, the safety of fellow believers and a pitcher full
of deep, rich, aromatic liquid bread.
</P>
<P>
   Say hello to Chimay ale.
</P>
<P>
   Now, imagine yourself in our kitchen. My queen puts the
finishing touches on an enormous Napa Valley-style sandwich with
smoked turkey, roasted red bell peppers, Vidalia onions and wilted
arugula on freshly baked rosemary bread, with homemade tarragon
mayonnaise and chutney mustard dressing. Then imagine washing it
all down with the same Chimay ale.
</P>
<P>
   Say hello to heaven.
</P>
<P>
   Which is as it should be, considering that Chimay ale is still
brewed by Belgian Trappist monks in the same well-considered manner
that it has been brewed in for at least 100 years. This particular
nectar comes corked with a metal cage atop an oversized bottle, and
the similarity to wine is not accidental. Belgians feel strongly
that beer is just as sophisticated a beverage as the grape
varietals of their French neighbors. And the reverence with which
they treat their brews is well-deserved.
</P>
<P>
   Chimay is unlike any beer you've come across. The murky color
results from a strong yeast presence that pleasantly permeates
every tonal quality from start to finish. Pour carefully, so that
the residue stays in the bottle. Your reward is a smooth, fruity,
rich concoction that works equally well as a delightful aperitif,
accompaniment to dinner or post-prandial toasting beverage.
</P>
<P>
   And the best part? You don't have to give yourself over to vows
of poverty, chastity and obedience _ it's already been done for
you.
</P>
<P>
   Such a deal. Oy.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In 1990, James Billington, the librarian of
Congress, persuaded Congress to provide the first $1 million to
start building a national library without walls.
</P>
<P>
   The idea then was to duplicate much of the Library of Congress'
huge holdings in electronic form so people in other parts of the
country could have access to the material without traveling to
Washington or even leaving home.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, said Laura Campbell, a Library of Congress
official, the only media suitable to the task were the video disk
and the CD-ROM.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not in the distribution business,'' Ms. Campbell said.
``How could we get this out?''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Ms. Campbell said, those were ``the days before the
Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   By 1994, the World Wide Web had evolved, making it easy for even
casual computer users to gain access to information on the
Internet. The Library of Congress saw it as the answer and sought
contributions to help put its holdings on line.
</P>
<P>
   The library solicited a donation from David Packard, the
co-founder of Hewlett-Packard, who knows something of computers.
``He said he loved the idea of getting this information out,'' Ms.
Campbell said. ``He gave us our first $5 million.''
</P>
<P>
   Metromedia chairman John Kluge gave $5 million, and the W.K.
Kellogg Foundation contributed $3 million. The $13 million in
donations gave the Library of Congress such a jump start that it
has reached its goal of raising $45 million for the project from
the private sector, while Congress has added $15 million.
</P>
<P>
   The gateway to the collection, which is stored on a server at
the library, is the Library of Congress' American Memory site
(memory.loc.gov/ammem/amhome.html). It drew 132,000 unique
visitors, or people who went to the site at least once, during
February, said a spokeswoman for Media Metrix, an Internet
measurement company. By comparison, the Library of Congress' main
government page, Thomas (thomas.loc.gov), which provides access to
every part of the federal government, got 249,000 unique visitors
that month, according to Media Metrix.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our competitive strength,'' Ms. Campbell said, ``is that we
have these unique and rare treasures to offer.''
</P>
<P>
   A person skimming through the offerings the other day clicked
into World War I material. First there was a recording of George M.
Cohan's ``Over There,'' sung by Billy Murray in 1917.
</P>
<P>
   Then came a recording from the U.S. commander in France, Gen.
John J. Pershing, who recorded a 33-second speech called ``From the
Battlefields of France'' in which he said:
</P>
<P>
   ``Three thousand miles from home, an American army is fighting
for you. Everything you hold worthwhile is at stake. Only the
hardest blows can win against the enemy we are fighting. Invoking
the spirit of our forefathers, the army asks your unshrinking
support, to the end that the high ideals for which America stands
may endure upon the earth.''
</P>
<P>
   From there, it was easy to navigate to a collection of World War
I photographs, one of them showing a German zeppelin brought down
in an English field.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Campbell, who is director of the library's National Digital
Library and directs a staff of 100 people, said there were now 1.7
million items on the Web site. The goal is to have 5 million by
next year, the library's bicentennial.
</P>
<P>
   The eventual target is to make available 80 million items from
the Library of Congress' collection that cannot be easily obtained
elsewhere. A complete set of Mark Twain is available at just about
every American library, so books like that will not be made
available on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   What will be made available are materials like the earliest
movies and sound recordings, maps, manuscripts, the papers of 23
presidents and photographs. Fragile rare books are also being put
online; less handling means that they will probably last longer.
Theft from libraries is also reduced when users go digital.
</P>
<P>
   One such rare item is Ralph Waldo Emerson's 1855 letter praising
Walt Whitman's ``Leaves of Grass,'' in which the established
Emerson called the little-known Whitman's work ``the most
extraordinary piece of wit and wisdom that America has yet
contributed,'' according to the site.
</P>
<P>
   Without asking permission, Whitman used Emerson's testimonial in
advertising for later editions of his collection of poetry,
including some in which he added erotic elements. Emerson was not
pleased, the entry adds.
</P>
<P>
   With the Library of Congress site, a teacher of a history course
on the American Revolution will be able to have students study not
only the final Declaration of Independence but also an earlier
draft by Thomas Jefferson with corrections in the margin by
Benjamin Franklin and John Adams.
</P>
<P>
   The American Memory site has Civil War photographs by Matthew
Brady and others (a picture taken by Alexander Gardner shows
Confederate dead at Antietam in 1862), the earliest authenticated
daguerreotype portrait of Abraham Lincoln (taken by Nicholas H.
Sheperd in 1846 or 1847), turn-of-the-century films of New York
street scenes (in one a horse-drawn fire engine races around a
corner) and Alexander Graham Bell's 1876 sketch of the telephone,
without which none of this would be possible.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   The shift from video disk and CD-ROM to the Internet has also
meant that the Library of Congress has been able to shift its
potential electronic audience from schools, universities and school
libraries to the desk of any person with a computer and modem.
</P>
<P>
   The Library of Congress can get its material in the most
unexpected ways. A collection of early baseball cards, which can be
seen on the American Memory site, was gathered by Benjamin K.
Edwards, who left it to his daughter, who gave it to the poet Carl
Sandburg, who donated it to the library.
</P>
<P>
   The Edwards collection includes 2,100 baseball cards, produced
from 1887 to 1914, and depicts the likes of Ty Cobb, Cy Young,
Connie Mack, Walter Johnson and Christy Mathewson. In those days,
most of the cards were distributed with cigarettes and were used
for both advertising and for stiffening the packages.
</P>
<P>
   To spread the word, the Library of Congress has begun a program
to show teachers how to use its collection in their classrooms. The
program, called American Memory Fellows, sends 50 teachers to
Washington for a week each summer and trains them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They agree to spend six weeks on line before coming here,''
Ms. Campbell said, ``and then give a commitment to continue to work
with us and make primary sources available in the classroom.''
</P>
<P>
   The teachers who have participated in the program's first two
years, Ms. Campbell said, ``are spreading the word'' about the
library on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Veccia, project manager for the National Digital Library,
said that the fellows for this year had been selected already. ``If
money is available, we will have it in years ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Information about applying for the fellowships can be obtained
by selecting the Learning Page on the American Memory home page and
then clicking on Educators' Program.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how the fellows were chosen, Ms. Veccia said that the
Library of Congress sought teachers ``who come with an idea of how
they are going to use it, who have some facility with the
technology _ we really can't be teaching technology skills at this
point _ and who are leaders in their fields.''
</P>
<P>
   The fellowship pays for transportation to Washington and
accommodations while here.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Veccia said here was not a clear picture of how much of the
Internet was being used in the classroom for educational purposes
and how much the Internet was simply being used to exchange e-mail
messages.
</P>
<P>
   Besides its own collection, the Library of Congress plans to put
other institutions' materials on the American Memory site. It has
received $2 million from Ameritech to start doing this with
material from the New-York Historical Society (which has provided
its Civil War collection) and the Chicago Historical Society (the
holder of the archives of The Chicago Daily News, a defunct
newspaper with a notable sports collection).
</P>
<P>
   For most of its 200 years, the Library of Congress has been
notable for its collection of books. Does this emphasis on
electronic media mark a basic shift in emphasis?
</P>
<P>
   No, answered Robert Zich, the director of the project's
electronic programs, it is really a way to whet the appetite.
Speaking of the Librarian of Congress, he said, ``Billington's goal
is to drive kids back to the libraries and reading books.''

AT PELICAN LAKE, BIRDS OF A FEATHER ROLL IN STYLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A few miles, as the pelican flies, from the warm green waters of
the Gulf of Mexico, tan bodies gathered round a patio table. The
conversation paused when an engine rumble neared. A new neighbor
was moving onto Southern Breeze Drive. ``Nice,'' Kraig Brechbuhler
said as the newest home on the block rolled by, its
burgundy-and-gold sides sparkling in the noon sun.
</P>
<P>
   In the gated community known as Pelican Lake Motorcoach Resort,
not only the neighbors come and go, but also the homes. No
Winnebagos here, however. This resort is exclusively for luxury
motor coaches, most of them longer than 37 feet. They look like
tour buses for rock stars.
</P>
<P>
   Interiors are just as flashy. One coach has a fountain in the
living room, another an electric fireplace. The Brechbuhlers have
neither. The only extra in the shiny coach that Kraig Brechbuhler
shares with his wife, Wendy, 37, and their 14-month-old daughter,
Madison, is a playpen. ``We keep it simple,'' said Brechbuhler, 47,
of Canton, Ohio. ``It's just a basic Prevost.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that's like saying you own a stripped Rolls-Royce.
Motor coaches built by Prevost Car Inc., the Canadian bus maker,
can cost as much as $1.4 million, and several at Pelican Lake do,
said Richard O'Connell, the resort's sales manager.
</P>
<P>
   While Winnebagos can cost as little as $50,000, the majority of
motor homes at Pelican Lake cost $500,000 to $1 million, excluding
the property they temporarily sit on. To insure a winter parking
space in Naples, owners buy terra firma _ a sixth of an acre for
$50,000 to $140,000.
</P>
<P>
   The resort supplies a paved driveway. And a lake view. ``But not
if they back in,'' O'Connell said. ``The coaches don't have a
window in back. So if they want the lake view, they have to pull in
and face it.''
</P>
<P>
   Landscaping and painting the driveways to look like mosaic tiles
are extra. Fred Rump of Beverly, N.J., spent $30,000 on his
landscaping. Rump put in a pond next to the lake, next to his
40-foot coach. The pond is filled with koi fish, which disappear
when his home starts up. Surrounding his driveway is a botanical
garden with palms, flowers and lush plants. ``I've always loved the
Florida scenery,'' he said. ``Now I have my own.'' He also paid
$5,000 to have his driveway painted aqua blue.
</P>
<P>
   In this community, driveways are often pink and blue, with
dolphins and palm-tree logos. Color coordination is important. The
45-foot Newell motor coach of Bill and Jodi Reckmeyer, who are New
Yorkers, is a majestic black trimmed in gold. So is the Suburban
that they tow behind it. One teal-colored coach has a matching
teal-colored satellite dish on the roof.
</P>
<P>
   The affluently mobile flock to Pelican Lake, with its 102 acres
of extra-wide roads, 295 lots that can be rented as well as bought,
an 8,000-square-foot clubhouse, a pool, a spa, tennis courts and a
35-acre lake. The resort opened just last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the Ritz-Carlton of camping,'' O'Connell said. ``Other
people think we're snobby here. But people with a certain type of
motor coach like to be with people with the same type.'' Pelican
Lake is one of two resorts in the country for motor coaches longer
than 26 feet. The other is in Southern California. ``We get the
yuppies in early retirement,'' O'Connell added.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Domino, 52, is retired from the Los Angeles Police
Department. He and his wife, Laurie, 37, live full time in their
40-foot motor home. For six years, they have been crisscrossing the
country, sharing their eight-foot-wide living space with Sharkie,
their Doberman pinscher.
</P>
<P>
   Last year in the Florida Keys, the Dominos met Tom Kozar, 50, a
recently retired builder, and his wife, Ericka. They also live full
time in a motor home with their Rottweiler, Kozoya. ``We bonded,''
Mrs. Kozar said. ``The dogs haven't.''
</P>
<P>
   This winter, the couples are renting side-by-side lots at
Pelican Lake. Both are considering buying. ``Because you'd be
guaranteed a location,'' Kozar said.
</P>
<P>
   The Kozars used to live in Brick, N.J. ``Which is right next to
Wall, N.J.,'' Kozar, said. ``I'm not kidding.'' In January, the
Kozars sold their bricks and walls and took to the road.
</P>
<P>
   No permanent address means no property taxes to pay, Kozar said.
Mail is delivered through a mail-forwarding company in Texas. A
cellular phone keeps them in contact with family and friends, and
finances are handled through a brokerage account. ``We're not
megawealthy,'' he said. ``But we get to do what we want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   They don't worry about security on the road. ``We have a sign in
our window,'' his wife said. ``It's got a picture of a Rottweiler,
and it says, `I don't dial 911.'''
</P>
<P>
   Where to spend the night when traveling in a home that maneuvers
like a Greyhound bus? ``We stay in the parking lots of Wal-Mart and
Cracker Barrel,'' Mrs. Brechbuhler said. ``They're very
understanding.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reckmeyers prefer truck stops. ``They have great security,
and the truckers are very nice,'' Mrs. Reckmeyer said. ``One night,
we were staying in a truck stop near Cleveland. It was about 3 a.m.
My husband is asleep, and I hear this knock on the door. I look
out, and there are two young ladies with these short, short skirts.
They have all this makeup on. I figure they must have been groupies
looking for a rock star. I peeked out and waved. They took off.''
</P>
<P>
   Owning a luxury motor home is a life style, Mrs. Reckmeyer said.
The Reckmeyers' style includes leather couches, marble steps, gold
mosaic columns, a Jacuzzi tub, washer, dryer, copper sinks and a
slide-out wall extension. ``I designed that,'' said Reckmeyer, who
is an architect and part-time consultant for Newell.
</P>
<P>
   The couple stay in their coach five or six months of the year.
``We also own a lot for it in Palm Springs,'' his wife said. They
recently bought a villa a few miles from Naples. ``For the extra
company,'' she said. ``We have eight grandchildren.''
</P>
<P>
   The Brechbuhlers' daughter sleeps in a playpen next to their
bed. Monitoring a toddler in a motor home is easier than in a
house, Mrs. Brechbuhler said. ``You don't have to chase her up
three floors.''
</P>
<P>
   In a few weeks, it's back to Ohio and work for Brechbuhler, who
is in the industrial-equipment business. The Dominos will head
west. ``We've been here for three months,'' Domino said. ``We're
getting antsy. Time to hit the road.''
</P>
<P>
   But there will be no musical horns when they leave. ``The older
set have these horns that play `On the Road Again' over and over,
or `Singin' in the Rain.''' Kozar said. ``It drives you crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dominos will pop in a CD. ``Probably `Margaritaville,'''
Mrs. Domino said. ``You drive to Key West, and the sun is shining
on the blue water, and Jimmy Buffet is singing. What more could you
ask for?''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kozar could think of one thing _ James Brown. ``I think
we'll play `I Feeeeel Good' when we leave,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   When Rump and his wife, Marlies, leave their koi fish and
luxuriant landscaping, they aren't sure what music they'll play.
This is their first year with a motor coach. ``We were looking for
a house, and we saw the sign for Pelican Lake,'' Rump explained.
``We liked it. So we bought a lot. Then we bought the motor coach.
I guess we're the only people who bought the driveway before the
home.''

CALIFORNIA MOVES TO BAN BLUE NITRO POTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ The Legislature is moving to outlaw an
elixir popular in dance clubs amid reports that dozens of people
have become seriously ill by ingesting the mood-enhancing
supplement.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes called Blue Nitro or Vitality, the potion is supposed
to improve moods, boost sexual performance, burn fat and enhance
sleep. The liquid is distributed legally, sometimes in sex shops
and mostly over the Internet, but can cause coma and blackout if
mixed with alcohol or other drugs.
</P>
<P>
   State and federal health officials are concerned because Blue
Nitro transforms into another dangerous substance, GHB
(gamma-hydroxybutyrate), that has been linked to the odorless and
tasteless ``date-rape'' drug that was outlawed in California two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   A measure passed by the Assembly Public Safety Committee on
Tuesday would ban the substance called gamma-butyrolactone, or GBL,
an active ingredient in the minty-tasting potions Blue Nitro and
Vitality.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to determine whether anyone has died as a result
of ingesting Blue Nitro or any GBL-related drink, state officials
said. That is because the substance becomes GHB in a person's
system and because coroners often don't test for GBL.
</P>
<P>
   But San Francisco health officials were concerned enough about
an increase in emergency-room visits and reports of people blacking
out as a result of the drug that they recently asked stores to
voluntarily pull it off shelves.
</P>
<P>
   ``This drug is very dangerous, and if we don't do something to
outlaw this drug, I can see it being even more of an epidemic,''
Lt. Kitt Crenshaw of the San Francisco Police Department told the
Assembly committee.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Mike Honda, chairman of the Public Safety Committee,
wrote the measure that effectively would outlaw elixirs such as
Blue Nitro. The measure requires a two-thirds vote of the
Legislature because Honda wants the ban implemented immediately if
it is passed and signed by Gov. Gray Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blue Nitro is a deadly health hazard and must be banned,''
Honda said. ``Date-rape drugs have no place in California, and Blue
Nitro has no place being marketed as a dietary supplement.''
</P>
<P>
   Honda's bill passed the committee with no opposition Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration says 55 people have had
negative reactions to ingesting GBL. In the most extreme case, a
woman was found dead in her home. Nineteen other people lost
consciousness, many with such difficulty in breathing that they
required the insertion of breathing tubes.
</P>
<P>
   Several GBL users were found to be incoherent while driving, and
one was involved in a car crash. Others appeared to have had
seizures.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA is asking manufacturers to recall all GBL products.
</P>
<P>
   One company, Florida-based Trimfast Group Inc., has agreed to
recall GBL sold under the names Revivarant and Revivarant G.
</P>
<P>
   Other GBL-laced products include Gamma G, GH Revitalizer,
Remforce and Insom-X.
</P>
<P>
   If other companies do not pull GBL off the market, the FDA could
seize the products.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Nitro is manufactured by a West Palm Beach, Fla.-based
company called Alpha Earth Inc. The company Web site boasts that
the positive effects of Blue Nitro ``may be due to the relation to
GHB.''
</P>
<P>
   The company asserts that the liquid is not toxic and ``like GHB
is 100 percent safe when taken as directed.'' The company's Web
site also includes a disclaimer _ in capital letters and with
exclamation points _ that it should never be taken with alcohol or
drugs.

THE TITANIC'S MYSTIQUE IN DIGITAL PACKAGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 Rick Archbold is the co-author with Dana McCauley of ``Last Dinner
on the Titanic: Menus and Recipes From the Great Liner.'' He just
put up the www.lastdinner.com Web site.  
 By RICK ARCHBOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Why does the sinking of Titanic on the night of April 14-15,
1912, still rank as the disaster to end all disasters? Worse
calamities have come and gone while the Titanic continues to hold
sway. James Cameron's ``Titanic'' was only the latest in a long
line of movie treatments of the subject going back to ``Saved From
the Titanic,'' released a mere month after the disaster and
starring a Titanic survivor, Dorothy Gibson.
</P>
<P>
   There have been so many books about the Titanic and the people
who built her and sailed on her that even students of the subject
have lost count. It has been said that the Titanic stands third in
the English words-in-print sweepstakes, after the Bible and the
Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Titanic story gained currency with the discovery
of the wreck on Sept. 1, 1985, by a joint U.S.-French expedition
led by Robert Ballard and Jean-Louis Michel. Suddenly the famous
ship was among us. If we couldn't touch her, we could see her,
looking remarkably well, thank you very much, despite all those
years away and all the inevitable decay.
</P>
<P>
   But the story's enduring popularity cannot be explained away by
the discovery of the wreck. The most common significance given to
the Titanic is technological: that the disaster was an example of
technology overreaching itself. Maybe that angle helps explain why
the Titanic story should have such mass appeal as we near the new
millennium. Like the late Edwardians, we have placed an enormous
amount of faith in our ability to transcend nature. Our Titanic
will not be a luxury liner but something quite different: a massive
power blackout or some other failure of highly centralized energy-
or communications-delivery systems. The current Year 2000 mania has
roots in the same psychological soil as the fascination with the
Titanic shipwreck.
</P>
<P>
   I would argue that the real keys to the Titanic's staying power
are related to when the sinking happened and how we heard about it.
The disasters we remember, that become part of popular culture, all
take place at a pregnant historical moment, usually as an era is
coming to a close. The Titanic sank as the Edwardian age was
drawing to a close. The Hindenburg, which probably ranks second in
the modern disaster popularity contest, burned in 1937, just before
the outbreak of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The other aspect of the technological importance of these
disasters has to do with mass communication. Each of these
20th-century disasters represents a sort of communications first.
</P>
<P>
   The Titanic was the first major disaster that people learned
about through the miracle of the wireless radio. (Before wireless,
a ship could sink without anyone noticing until it failed to show
up at its port of destination.) The Hindenburg was the first great
catastrophe that people saw in moving pictures. But the Titanic is
the first great disaster of the electronic age. And still the
greatest.
</P>
<P>
   JAMES CAMERON'S TITANIC EXPLORER
</P>
<P>
   (Fox Interactive; $29.98; Windows 95 and 98, Power Macintosh.)
</P>
<P>
   A three-disk package from Fox Interactive, James Cameron's
Titanic Explorer: A Historical Journey on the Ship of Dreams, makes
two clever promises on its cover: ``Historically accurate
unreleased `Titanic' film scenes!'' and ``3D virtual tour!''
</P>
<P>
   To keep his film under four hours, Cameron had to excise great
chunks of celluloid, including the tale of the Californian, a
nearby ship that probably saw the Titanic's distress rockets but
did not come to her rescue. As for the promise of a visual tour,
anyone who has dreamed about sailing on the famous liner has
imagined exploring her from stem to stern.
</P>
<P>
   When you enter Titanic Explorer, you have two options: the
Timeline and the Browser. The Timeline employs archival
photographs, documents and brief clips from the movie, accompanied
by narration, to recount a series of short segments of the Titanic
story. (I hope the audio hiccups that blanked out many pieces of
the narration were unique to my copy.) If you simply played the
Timeline from the beginning of disk one (Ship of Dreams) to the end
of disk three (The Legend Comes to Light), you would get a nice
visual and verbal summary of the history of the ship; the story of
the maiden voyage, the shipwreck and the rescue, and what has
happened since, notably the discovery of the wreck in 1985 and the
issues surrounding the salvaging of thousands of artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   The Browser functions like a Titanic archive, a modest archive
but fascinating nonetheless. It includes no video clips but many
images and much information: a complete passenger and crew list,
for example, with an X beside the name of every person lost,
builders' plans for every deck and biographies of many passengers
and crew members, both prominent and obscure. In the Browser for
disk one you will also encounter the ``virtual tour'' of the ship
touted on the cover.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, the virtual tour is a real disappointment. It promises 64
separate sites on the ship, but who knows how you get to them all.
Nothing on the CD-ROM itself explains how to move easily from place
to place or from deck to deck, and the instruction booklet included
in the package is equally unhelpful.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it's neat to visit one of the D-deck parlor suites, with
their gorgeous bouquets of fresh-cut flowers, and examine the
details of the paneling around the fireplace. Even better is to
stand in the grand first-class dining saloon and, by dragging the
cursor across the image, rotate your view 360 degrees (a feature
that is available at all tour sites). But if you try to walk
through the doors that lead into the pantry, you are out of luck.
And try as I might, I couldn't get below D deck, which meant I
never made it down to see the huge reciprocating engines or the
giant boilers _ assuming they are among the sites included. I found
no index to tell me what the promised 64 sites were.
</P>
<P>
   Another letdown came when I returned to the Timeline and jumped
forward to disk two (Tragedy Strikes), eager to see some of the
promised missing scenes from the movie. I scrolled down the
Timeline choices and clicked on The Californian Officers Watch
Rocket, only to be met by a group photo of the ship's captain and
her officers (unidentified) and a series of rough stop- action
views of the Titanic as she might have looked from the steamer
stopped a few miles away at the edge of an icefield. Maybe Fox
Interactive would have had to pay the actors extra to include these
outtakes. I never did find any unseen movie bits, although I am
sure some minor outtakes are there. Somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Anxious to discover if Titanic Explorer included any information
about my special interest, the cuisine on the Titanic, I tried a
search on the word food. The search yielded two items, Cargo List
and Transcripts. These are edited transcripts of the two inquiries
held after the sinking, one American, the other British. When I
went to that page, however, my only recourse was to read all the
transcripts in search of a few food references.
</P>
<P>
   A search on menus yielded better results, actual menus for all
three classes. But if you are hungry for information on what the
food was like or how it was prepared or served, you will search in
vain _ unless you link to Books, Images and Films, where I was
happy to find my book listed, but less happy to find my name
misspelled. Glaringly absent from the list of further reading,
however, is the best book about the heyday of the trans-Atlantic
liner, John Maxtone-Graham's ``The Only Way to Cross.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite such disappointments, Titanic Explorer works well for
its intended audience: movie fans who want to know more about the
ship. The software is at its best when feeding the insatiable
appetite for Titanic trivia. One of my favorite Browser options was
the topic Unbelievable Truths, which recounts, among others, the
delightful story of Baker Charles Joughin, who survived two hours
in the freezing water supposedly with the aid of an antifreeze
known as Scotch whisky. (Since alcohol actually helps to lower
one's body temperature, a more likely explanation of this
remarkable feat is that Joughin never stopped moving while in the
water.) In the same section, you can learn how the wireless
operator aboard the Carpathia, Thomas Cottam, received the
Titanic's distress call just as he was about to close down his
Marconi set for the night (standard practice in the early days of
shipboard wireless _ until the Titanic sank). And it was here that
I first learned about Rosa Abbott, from third class, the only woman
to be saved from the icy water.
</P>
<P>
   The Cargo List may not shed much light on Titanic cuisine, but
it did provide a detailed accounting of passenger cargo, with its
tantalizing hints about the lives of those on board. Highlights
include Robert Daniel's champion French bulldog and Ella Holmes
White's four roosters and a hen. After the sinking, Daniel claimed
$750 for his lost pooch (more than a year's salary for a North
American worker in 1912) and Mrs. White claimed $207.87 for her
drowned poultry.
</P>
<P>
   TOTAL TITANIC: A NIGHT TO REMEMBER
</P>
<P>
   (Byron Preiss Multimedia; $45.99; Windows 95 and 98, Macintosh.)
</P>
<P>
   Total Titanic turns out to be a CD-ROM version of the 1958 movie
that was based on Walter Lord's best-selling book. The film is
truer to the story of the real disaster than is James Cameron's
more grandiose version. But the picture quality, at least on my new
iMac, was poor _ I'd rather watch the film on video _ so I linked
to the commentary that you can listen to while the movie plays
quietly in the background.
</P>
<P>
   The commentary is actually an extended conversation between a
historian, Don Lynch, and an artist and visual historian, Ken
Marschall, two of the most knowledgeable students of the Titanic in
the world. (I edited their book ``Titanic: An Illustrated
History.'') Both men acted as consultants for Cameron's Titanic
Explorer CD-ROM, but the two clearly love the earlier film and
comment intelligently on the many details that contribute to its
historical accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   But that level of discourse is for serious buffs only. When it
comes to interesting and accessible information about the ship, the
voyage and the passengers, Total Titanic fails miserably. Its
Passenger List turns out to include only those passengers appearing
in the 1958 movie, ``A Night to Remember,'' accompanied by
photographs not of the actual passengers but of their actor
substitutes. It also provides complete blueprints of the ship, but
nothing like the various model views of all parts of the ship
provided by the Titanic Explorer disk set.
</P>
<P>
   Total Titanic comes with a second disk that holds a very good
British documentary about the making of ``A Night to Remember.'' An
index allows you to select segments of interest, the best of which
by far is an interview with Walter Lord, the original master of
Titanic lore (he appears frequently in the film). Otherwise the
documentary focuses almost entirely on how the movie was made and
promoted. The segment about building the life-size facsimile of a
piece of the ship used as a film set makes fascinating reading in
the wake of all the print spilled over James Cameron's building of
an almost full-size replica of the whole ship. I was delighted to
learn, for example, that the 1958 set reproduced only a middle
section long enough to include two funnels that used a mere 4,000
tons of steel. Better still, the derelict steamship employed for
shooting the scenes of lowering lifeboats was leased for the
whopping sum of 100 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   All that is good fun, although most likely of limited interest
to those who are not devotees of the film. But then, I suppose
Titanic film buffs are its primary audience. It's amazing that such
a select group could make a CD-ROM viable.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone wanting a proper introduction to what Walter Lord has
aptly called an ``unsinkable subject'' would do better to shell out
for James Cameron's Titanic Explorer or, better still, buy a video
of ``A Night to Remember'' along with one of the better general
books on the Titanic. And that's a pity, given the enormous but as
yet untapped potential of the CD-ROM medium for Titanic
enthusiasts. Maybe someone will soon have the wit to hire Lynch and
Marschall to help create the comprehensive, interactive Titanic
encyclopedia. I would be first in line to buy it.
</P>

THE FLAVORS OF FUSION: AUTHOR HUGH CARPENTER BRINGS DIVERSE CUISINE
TO MAINSTREAM MENUS &HT;    
 &HT;    
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ANN CRISWELL 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A touch of Thai peanut sauce on chicken salad.
Moroccan spices on Texas barbecue. Cilantro pesto on pasta.
</P>
<P>
   During the past 10 or 15 years, inventive chefs and home cooks
have played the mix-and-match game with cross-cultural combinations
that have worked their way into our everyday menus.
</P>
<P>
   Hugh Carpenter, former California restaurateur who writes
cookbooks and teaches cooking classes in the Napa Valley, was one
of the first to fuse Asian and American ingredients, techniques and
style.
</P>
<P>
   His award-winning cookbooks ``Pacific Flavors'' and ``Chopstix''
helped introduce fusion cuisine. While in Houston recently to teach
classes at Le Panier, LaVerl Daily's cooking school, Carpenter took
a fresh look at the trend that became a cooking revolution.
</P>
<P>
   His ``Fusion Food Cookbook,'' published in 1994 by Artisan, was
``a little ahead of its time. Everyone was confused about what
`fusion' meant,'' Carpenter said. ``Fusion received something of a
bad name because some young cooks who are not chefs yet try all
sorts of bizarre combinations.''
</P>
<P>
   First you have to be thoroughly grounded in the foundations of
cooking and understand the different cuisines before you can put
together elements of other cultures as trained chefs would, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now if you go to the trendy restaurants in France, they're
using Asian ingredients such as ginger and lemongrass.''
</P>
<P>
   Although fusion started with an East-West mixture of Asian and
American, it applies to techniques or ingredients from any other
cooking tradition _ Southwestern, Caribbean, Mediterranean ...
</P>
<P>
   Fusion fits right in with the current main trend in food that
Carpenter sees _ Americans want more flavor.
</P>
<P>
   At home, you can cook something in an authentic way, but give it
a little twist, he said. Make pesto sauce with cilantro instead of
basil. Or add fresh ginger to guacamole (slice the ginger thinly,
and force it through a garlic press). Rub the top of a meatloaf
with hoisin sauce, then oven-roast it.
</P>
<P>
   Houston, with its ethnic diversity and influences from Mexico,
the Southwest, and Chinese, Vietnamese and other Asian cuisines, is
a city where there will be a lot of melding of cooking traditions,
he said. He marveled at the Mexican food at Taco Milagro, Robert
Del Grande's Mexican restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``California Mexican food is still mired in Chilies Rellenos
made the traditional way, stuffed with cheese and Ortega sauce
poured over it. At Taco Milagro, they were stuffed with chihuahua
cheese, dried apricots and pecans with a guajillo chili sauce _
just astounding.''
</P>
<P>
   Many fusion recipes have lengthy lists of exotic ingredients
that are not always available in supermarkets, Carpenter said.
</P>
<P>
   In his new cookbooks, which he does with his wife, photographer
Teri Sandison, Carpenter is simplifying recipes so there are fewer
ingredients and easier cooking techniques. Books in the recent
``Hot'' series (``Hot Chicken,'' ``Hot Pasta,'' ``Hot Wok,'' ``Hot
Barbecue'' and the newest, ``Hot Vegetables'') contain some
fusion-style recipes. They were published by Ten Speed Press;
$17.95 each.
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter is concentrating on using only ingredients available
in supermarkets in his new books, including ``Great Ribs,'' to be
published in May by Ten Speed Press ($14.95). His next series of
books is on fast cooking. It will start with ``Fast Appetizers,''
to be published in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Markets have really improved since ``Fusion'' came out in
1994. Almost every supermarket has soy sauce, oyster sauce, hoisin,
sesame oil, dried anchos and chipotles in adobo. There's been an
explosion in the availability of tropical fruits, mushrooms and
other varieties of vegetables _ particularly Asian vegetables. And
there's a vast increase in the quality and quantity of bottled
condiments _ chutneys, infused oils, salsas and ethnic condiments
such as Asian chili sauce.''
</P>
<P>
   Fusion is more than a trend, Carpenter said. The ``forest'' is
fusion food, and the ``trees'' are the different authentic ethnic
ways of cooking. It will continue to be popular, he said,
especially cross-cultural cooking emphasizing freshness and flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Fusion carries over to all his cookbooks. In ``Great Ribs,'' for
example, there's a mango sauce for ribs. In ``Hot Pasta,''
California Lo Mein blends spaghetti with Chinese long beans, baby
bok choy, ginger, orange zest, rice wine, sesame oil and Chinese
sauces.
</P>
<P>
   Fusion dishes are featured during Carpenter's eighth annual Camp
Napa Culinary Adventure. Five sessions are planned from June to
October for the food and wine adventure. Camp starts with a
reception at Carpenter's home in Oakville, Calif. It includes a
five-day tour of fine wineries and cooking classes hosted by
Cakebread Cellars. For information, call 888-999-HUGH (4844) or
write Camp Napa Culinary, P.O Box 114, Oakville, Calif. 94562.

TURKEY, RELENTING, SHOWS THE WORK OF A KURD NATIONALIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, April 11)  
 (bl)  
 By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ Probably no Turkish film has had the
worldwide impact of Yilmaz Guney's ``Yol,'' a harrowing look at
what is portrayed as a land of harsh military rule and feudal
codes.
</P>
<P>
   At the 1982 Cannes International Film Festival, ``Yol'' shared
the top award, the Palme d'Or, with the Costa-Gavras classic
``Missing,'' becoming the only Turkish film to win such a high
international honor. It had a long run in the United States and
instilled in many viewers a sense that Turkey was a backward and
frightening place.
</P>
<P>
   One friend of mine who saw it told me that it had rid her of any
desire ever to go to Turkey. Another was so distraught that she
drove her car into a tree on the way home from the movie, emerging
uninjured but severely shaken.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, however, most Turks have had no chance to see
``Yol.'' Guney, a Kurdish nationalist, was in prison when the film
was made according to his script and instructions. When he appeared
on stage to claim his award in Cannes, he was an escapee wanted by
Turkish police. The clenched fist he raised upon receiving his
award was a symbol of defiance as well as triumph; he died two
years later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yol'' was banned by the military government that held power in
Turkey in the early 1980s. Civilians returned to power in 1983, and
the ban on ``Yol'' was lifted in 1992, but for a variety of
technical and financial reasons it is only now being shown publicly
here. A new print has been prepared, and since February it has been
drawing big crowds at dozens of theaters around the country. At the
Istanbul Film Festival in April, three more of Guney's films will
be shown, all with new prints that the Turkish government paid to
make for a festival of Turkish cinema held in Paris in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The long-delayed release of ``Yol'' has provoked much comment
here. Despite the fact that Guney was a devastating critic of
Turkish society and an ethnically assertive Kurd, remarkably little
of the comment has been negative. Most has focused on the quality
of Guney's films and his achievement in bringing Turkish cinema to
world attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a supporter of the Kurdish cause, which I oppose
because I believe in the unitary state,'' said Halit Refig, an
active Turkish director. ``But I still have great respect for him
as one of the best filmmakers this country has produced. It's great
that he is back on the screen.''
</P>
<P>
   Guney wrote the script for ``Yol'' while serving a prison term
for a murder that he had evidently committed in the heat of an
argument over a woman. He smuggled the screenplay out, and the
movie was filmed clandestinely in southeastern Turkey under the
direction of one of his collaborators, Serif Goren. Goren has
complained that his role in making the film is being forgotten in
the wave of acclaim for Guney, and he boycotted the glittering
Istanbul premiere in February.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yol,'' which means ``road,'' tells the story of five inmates
of a Turkish prison who are given a 10-day furlough. As they make
their way to their homes in the mostly Kurdish southeast, they
confront violence, military repression, vendetta feuds, ancient
attitudes toward women and honor, and other aspects of the
Turkish-Kurdish reality. They seem to find their homes and home
lives at least as imprisoning as their jail cells.
</P>
<P>
   Although ``Yol'' is intense and unavoidably political, it is
also full of wry touches. One prisoner, looking over the temporary
identification card he has been issued, complains, ``This picture
makes me look like a murderer.'' A fellow passenger on a train asks
him why he was imprisoned. ``For killing a man,'' he replies, and
everyone around begins to laugh.
</P>
<P>
   The Kurdish issue is very much on Turkey's mind these days
because the principal Kurdish guerrilla leader, Abdullah Ocalan,
has been captured and is awaiting a trial that could result in his
execution. In a concession to Turkish sensibilities, the one shot
cut from the original print of ``Yol'' is of a sign seen by one
prisoner on his way home. It says ``Kurdistan,'' a word considered
hostile to the government because it suggests that the
predominantly Kurdish region has an identity apart from the rest of
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Guney himself took advantage of a prison furlough in 1981 to
escape, and he made his home in France until his death. Many of
those who are now seeing ``Yol'' were children when it was made.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a Kurd from Turkey, and for the first time I find my own
culture in a film,'' said one of them, Rohat Yucel, a 21-year-old
student. ``For the first time, Kurdish motifs are presented in a
natural, genuine way. It's the first time I feel represented in a
film.''
</P>
<P>
   If ``Yol'' gave many foreigners their first impression of Turkey
when it was shown in the 1980s, it has a very different impact
here. Turks who live in Istanbul and other cities, or for that
matter anywhere outside the impoverished southeast, see it as a
window into the life of that region. To view it as a representation
of Turkey is akin to seeing ``The Grapes of Wrath'' or ``Fort
Apache, the Bronx'' as representing life in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The three Guney films that are to be shown at the festival here,
``Hungry Walls,'' ``Seyyit Han'' and ``Hope,'' were all made before
``Yol.'' Festival organizers expect all the shows to be sellouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He began as an assistant to other directors, but he went on to
create his own world and proved himself as a true auteur,'' said
Hulya Ucansu, the festival director. ``He was a very sensitive
creator. Because of his literary experience as a short story
writer, his mind worked in a very poetic way. He was reflecting the
poverty of his people, and his written language, his visual
language and the situations he created were very poetic, sometimes
tragically so.''
</P>
<P>
   The free release of ``Yol'' may be seen as a sign of the
loosening political and cultural climate in Turkey. Some of those
involved in making it, however, are not yet willing to congratulate
their government for its new-found tolerance.
</P>
<P>
   ``These days you are always hearing `All bans are lifted,' and
people believe it,'' one of the actors, Necmettin Cobanoglu, said
after the Istanbul premiere. ``But how can we say it is true when
there are still unsolved murders and people are still in jail for
expressing their thoughts? `Yol' paints a complete picture of
Turkey, and I hope it will start some serious discussion.''

THE NEW BERLIN: ONCE AGAIN, A CITY REWARDS THE WALKER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, April 11)  
 (also see BERLIN-IDENTITY, BERLIN-CULTURE, BERLIN-SUBCULTURE,
BERLIN  
 REDEVELOP, BERLIN-ARCHITECTURE and BERLIN-VOICES)  
 (bl)  
 By HERBERT MUSCHAMP   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ It's safe to go walking again in Berlin. In fact, the
time has come for city lovers to reclaim Germany's once and future
capital as a spiritual home. For it was here, in the early decades
of the century, that flanerie _ the practice of strolling leisurely
around a big city just to take in the sights _ came into its own as
a modern art form. After 12 years of Nazi brutality and 44 years of
Cold War, this gentle art has once again become a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   There are many new sights to take in. Buildings by Rafael Moneo,
Dominique Perrault, Richard Rogers, Jean Nouvel, Josef Kleihues and
other luminaries of contemporary architecture. Scores of office
buildings in a crisp modern idiom. Vibrantly restored landmarks in
the former Eastern sector, like the Hackesche Hof, a complex of
galleries, design studios, cafes and courtyards that has become the
center of Berlin's architectural life. The former showcase of the
West is now a gateway to the East, a part of the globe caught up in
writing a new chapter of world history. Berlin is suffused with the
promise and anxiety of that enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   The flaneur, initially a French type, entered literature in the
19th century in the writing of Charles Baudelaire. But, as Anke
Gleber recounts in her fine new book, ``The Art of Taking a Walk,''
it was in Weimar Berlin that the literature of city walking
blossomed into an intellectual movement. Walter Benjamin's
``One-Way Street,'' Siegfried Kracauer's ``Streets in Berlin'' and
Franz Hessel's ``Sightseeing Trip'' celebrate flanerie as an
essential education in modern sensibility.
</P>
<P>
   These writers viewed Berlin through lenses cut and polished by
the young century's art movements: Futurism, Cubism, Expressionism,
Surrealism. For them, the modern industrial city might not be a
work of art, but walking through it could be. Bustling crowds, shop
windows, arc lights, neon signs, cinemas, hotel lobbies, grand
cafes, posters, handbills, advertising kiosks, the rustle of
newspapers, the movement of trams and cars, the accelerating pace
of urban change: all this added up to something more than idle
spectacle. It was the leading university for training minds to
comprehend the modern world.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin's 1928 essay ``One-Way Street'' is perhaps the crucial
text of flaneur writing. In it, Benjamin records the impressions of
a walker forever seeking the next vista, the next streetscape, the
next corner at which to turn. For the book's first edition, the
cover shows a trio of one-way street signs: arrows pointing to the
left, the word Einbahnstrasse emblazoned within them.
</P>
<P>
   The sign evokes the arrow of time. Like the flaneur, the city is
moving ever forward. After World War I, Wilhelmine Berlin, the
imperial city, is breaking up like an ice floe. Its fragments
recede into the past, along with the social stability that the
imperial monuments were designed to reinforce.
</P>
<P>
   Last February, I went to Berlin to follow in the footsteps of
the Weimar flaneurs. A paradoxical task to assign oneself: even if
much of the flaneurs' Berlin had not been physically obliterated by
hot and Cold War and urban redevelopment, retrospection runs
counter to the flaneurial spirit. But Berlin is now a city of
two-way streets. All those building cranes swiveling confidently on
the skyline proclaim City on the Move! Advance! This Way Forward!
But this has also become a city where much of the traffic is headed
backward: toward history, memory and their traces.
</P>
<P>
   And the post-Cold War years have revealed a Berlin that is a
museum of itself. The city's International Style buildings have
become period pieces that one passes on the way to other period
pieces: the Reichstag. The Victory Column. The Schinkel buildings.
The New Synagogue. Brandenburg Gate. Monuments of the Soviet era.
</P>
<P>
   In today's Berlin, a cup and saucer from the legendary Cafe
Yosty, retrieved from the rubble around the wall, have acquired an
aura nearly as precious as Schliemann's gold. Chunks of the wall
itself, like the Elgin marbles, have entered museums. The limestone
facade and gilded public rooms of the fabled Hotel Esplanade are
enshrined within a new apartment block of steel and glass.
</P>
<P>
   Walking eastward along the southern edge of the Tiergarten, we
come upon the Culture Forum, a trio of modern buildings that are
especially poignant: Mies van der Rohe's New National Gallery, Hans
Scharoun's Philharmonic Hall and the same architect's State
Library. Though built after the war, they were designed by
architects who attained prominence in the Weimar years.
Disconnected from one another by roads, traffic, parking and their
own monumentality, the three buildings float in an urban vacuum: an
art museum, a library, a concert hall in the center of a city where
books were burned, paintings banned, music silenced, culture
extinguished.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Metal Forest of Cranes
</P>
<P>
   Beyond these modern landmarks lies the one-time heart of the
flaneur universe: Potsdamer Platz. For the last five years, this
has been the largest construction site in Europe: the densest part
of the city's metal forest of cranes. Here, Germany has
concentrated its hopes for Berlin: capital city, city of tomorrow,
millennial metropolis.
</P>
<P>
   But the three major commercial developments rising in and around
Potsdamer Platz face daunting competition from ghosts. This was the
hub of Weimar flanerie: site of Europe's first electric traffic
sign (1924), installed to orchestrate the movement of cars, buses,
trams and crowds of people on their way to work. Roughly
equivalent, as a social magnet, to Times Square or Piccadilly
Circus, this is where full-time flaneurs lolled in the lobbies of
the Palast, Bellevue and Fuerstenhof hotels, browsed in the
Wertheim department store or passed the time at Yosty, Haus
Vaterland, the Pschorrhaus, and other cafes and beer halls. And
here, in 1932, rose Columbus Haus, a commercial building designed
by Erich Mendelsohn, the city's finest example of the New
Architecture pioneered by the Bauhaus.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the Cold War, this was the epicenter of the Death Zone,
the flattened strip of rubble, weeds, wild rabbits and searchlight
beams patrolled by East German border guards. Some think this
blood-soaked wasteland had as much right to landmark status as the
Brandenburg Gate. Many regard the corporate district of the new
Potsdamer Platz as a classier kind of wasteland.
</P>
<P>
   You are now entering the Sony Sector. The Daimler-Benz Sector.
The A&AMP;T Sector. Like postwar Berlin, Potsdamer Platz and the
adjacent Leipziger Platz are divided into zones of occupation, in
this case three. Each is controlled by a different corporate giant
and has been planned under the supervision of a different
architect. The Sony and Daimler-Benz areas are now substantially
built. The third, for the real estate development company A&AMP;T, is
scheduled for completion next year. Plans for all the schemes are
on view inside Info-Box, the red, rectangular high-tech structure
that has become the symbol of a city in progress.
</P>
<P>
   In the 19th century, architects sought to fix equations between
period styles and architectural functions: Gothic for churches,
Roman for government buildings and so on. Something like that has
been attempted at Potsdamer Platz. The three architects have
adopted different approaches, keyed to the ratio between masonry
and glass and their connotations of tradition and modernity.
</P>
<P>
   Sony's European headquarters, designed by Helmut Jahn, is the
most compact of the three developments and the most assertively
modernistic. It is a triangle of seven buildings, all with sleek
glass curtain walls, set on a podium raised above street level.
Runway lights blink from the corner of the most prominent tower,
suggesting messages beamed upward toward communications satellites.
Enclosed within the triangle is the Sony Forum, a circular,
tent-roofed mall, ringed with theaters for Imax presentations and
other amusements.
</P>
<P>
   At the opposite end of the glass spectrum is Park Kolonnaden, a
mixed-use project planned and partly designed by Giorgio Grassi for
A&AMP;T. The most traditional of the three areas, the park is intended
to knit the new Potsdamer Platz into the city's historical fabric.
Its five large buildings face a landscaped strip that extends south
from Potsdamer Platz to the Landwehrkanal. Their U- and H-shaped
plans are modeled after classical town palace designs. The
buildings are clad in light red brick, with entrance pavilions of
light stone that protrude into the courtyards. Rectangular windows
are punched through otherwise unadorned facades.
</P>
<P>
   With 19 new buildings, the Daimler-Benz section is by far the
largest of the new developments. In addition to those designed by
Renzo Piano himself, there are projects by Arata Isozaki, Rogers
and others. In his own buildings, Piano contrasts crisp glass and
steel with thin panels of warm terra-cotta brick. This is the
static Piano of the Ircam annex in Paris, not the dynamic Piano of
the Pompidou Center across the way. The buildings are fiercely
elegant, especially at the corners where streets meet at acute
angles. Until you actually walk around them, the facades look like
freestanding screens.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers' glass office building on Linkstrasse is an hommage to
two industrial age icons. The central portion is shaped as a
half-ziggurat, recalling Joseph Paxton's original Crystal Palace,
while a corner turret brings to mind the famous stair tower of the
model factory designed by Werkbund Gropius for the Cologne Werkbund
exhibition in 1914. Isozaki's office building for the Berliner
Volksbank looks like an hommage to American motel wallpaper: a
lackluster holiday for cafe au lait tiles. Are these feeble,
patterned facades intended to mock the triumph of mass consumption?
</P>
<P>
   Edge City, Capitalist Wall
</P>
<P>
   So the new Potsdamer Platz conjugates space. Its three parts
evoke three phases in the history of Berlin: the imperial city of
baroque palaces, the industrial city of mechanical production and
the informational city of advanced electronic communications. If
this were a theme park, one might call these three sections Main
Street (A&AMP;T), Factory Town (Daimler-Benz) and Cyber Land (Sony).
</P>
<P>
   What Potsdamer Platz truly resembles, however, is an edge city:
one of those private, development-driven urbanoid clusters that
have sprouted up across the American landscape in recent years. It
is reassuring that the new Potsdamer Platz is notably without
nationalist expressions. The downside of this is that the place
could be anywhere. Like other edge cities, it occupies a kind of
nebulous international airport space.

   DISPATCHES FROM DREAMSVILLE: A strong foundation for life
</P>
<P>
   (``Dispatches from Dreamsville'' is an occasional series in
which readers share with Cox Newspapers senior writer Joe Murray
their memories of growing up in small-town America. Back then, or
at least the way we remember it, life was like a dream.)
</P>
<P>
   By Jerry Washington
</P>
<P>
   Special to Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   EAST POINT, Ga. _ The sound of spring is in the air, and I am
about to reach a major plateau in my life. I'm turning 40 on May
21.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, it's hard to believe that I have come this far,
growing up poor
</P>
<P>
   on a dirt road next to a sewage treatment plant in Fort
Lauderdale, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   But thanks to the small, tight community on 19th Terrace, 17th
Avenue and 15th Avenue, I received the total care of a community
that takes care of their little ones.
</P>
<P>
   I owe a world of debt to many people in my hometown for my
proper upbringing.
</P>
<P>
   I must thank Mrs. Sarah Pettis, my very first teacher, for
making kindergarten a wonderful, warm experience. She was the spark
that made learning real.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Bonner, my middle school counselor/teacher, was a
lifesaver. She made the turbulent days of integration, puberty and
growing up poor a tolerable experience.
</P>
<P>
   Her kindness and her interest in me helped build up my
self-esteem. She nearly succeeded in adopting me. I am eternally
grateful for the love she so willingly gave.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Burroughs was a community activist, a mother, a teacher, a
businesswoman who took the time to invite an inner-city kid to her
home to sit at her table and experience dinner with the whole
family.
</P>
<P>
   She did this on a regular basis. I learned a lot from these
formal and sometimes informal dinners.
</P>
<P>
   I was allowed to share my views concerning current events and
family matters. We got to know each other a little better, thus
bringing us closer to the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Burroughs holds a special place in my heart. Her family is
the epitome of what families should be.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Bolden is a self-made man. He is the father of six children.
He is a hard worker and a loving husband.
</P>
<P>
   He would have family worship on Friday nights. He was a man I
trusted and valued as a person. I'll always appreciate the
man-to-man talks and direction he attempted to bring to me.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Bolden provided a strong and positive role model for many of
us in the neighborhood. His children still call him Daddy.
</P>
<P>
   There are other people like the Boldens who provided wisdom and
understanding whenever I needed it.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kennedy was another soul who was a source of comfort and
moral support. She treated me like an adult, which allowed me to
see things more clearly.
</P>
<P>
   I'll always remember the churches I attended _ Mt. Olive Baptist
and First Baptist Piney Grove _ for nurturing and providing a safe
place in the midst of an urban environment.
</P>
<P>
   My life is for the best. I am self-employed, a father, husband,
lobbyist, writer and friend of the friendless.
</P>
<P>
   My attitude is on an even keel, although I have a short fuse
when it comes to ignorant and selfish people. I think we can all
lend a hand and give each other the kind of help we all need every
once in a while.
</P>
<P>
   Someone else who has inspired me is Dr. Kathleen Wright, who
insisted that we help each other and that we become friends. Dr.
Wright's example has led me to become active in many social and
civic affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to her, I have coached young men and women to excellence.
I am teaching parenting classes throughout the city of East Point.
</P>
<P>
   I've made it my business to lobby for special causes, especially
as they relate to community, children and senior citizen affairs.
</P>
<P>
   From Sarah Pettis to Dr. Wright, from Fort Lauderdale to East
Point, I thank those people who have made turning 40 a nice way to
celebrate life.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Guantanamo wrong for Kosovo refugees
 &HT;    (Eds: This is the Kleinberg column that normally would move for
Sunday, April 11. Because of its content and the current events, it
is for immediate release.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Let me understand this: The United States is shipping
20,000 Kosovo refugees to the Guantanamo Naval Base in Cuba just in
time for the start of the hurricane season. To sleep in tents.
</P>
<P>
   We are relocating 20,000 cold-weather people 4,500 miles to the
eastern tip of Cuba at a time of year when the mosquitoes begin
breeding, when the temperatures soar into the 90s and when you can
wring out the humidity with a towel.
</P>
<P>
   Let me also understand that while there are some materials at
Gitmo now _ a tent camp there for thousands of Cuban refugees was
disassembled in 1996 _ much more has to be shipped in; beds, tents,
kitchen equipment, toilets.
</P>
<P>
   Who's running this madhouse? Don't tell me, I already know.
</P>
<P>
   It is a fine humanitarian thing the U.S. is doing, getting those
20,000 unfortunates out of harm's way, but are we setting them up
for another batch of despair? Wasn't there room somewhere in Maine,
in Michigan, in Iowa, where the weather wasn't so tropical and
foreign to these people?
</P>
<P>
   Canada, for instance, is relocating Kosovars to southern
Ontario, not the harshness of territories near the Arctic Circle.
</P>
<P>
   We are being told that the Kosovars are going to Gitmo and not
to the U.S. because if they touch U.S. soil, they might be able to
apply for asylum. It's a shallow argument, easily fixed by a quick
piece of legislation, just as we manipulate immigration law on a
regular basis to fit other events of our time.
</P>
<P>
   Aren't the Kosovars going through enough shock without having to
possibly dodge hurricanes in a tent?
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't anyone recall that Hurricane Georges howled through
Guantanamo just last September after it shred a path through Puerto
Rico and the island of Hispaniola? It's that time again. June 1
starts the hurricane season. Batten down the hatches _ except there
are no hatches to batten down with a tent.
</P>
<P>
   It just seems to me that a better location could have been
chosen. I have no problem with our relocating 20,000 Kosovars. I
just think we are sending them to the wrong place.
</P>
<P>
   It is naive to assume that since a hurricane hit Guantanamo last
year, it won't hit again. Lightning may not strike twice in the
same place, but hurricanes do.
</P>
<P>
   What would happen should a hurricane bear down on Guantanamo?
These people would have to be evacuated again, right? Or they could
be left there to ride it out in tents. As one who rode out
Hurricane Andrew in a sturdy house, only to have it come down
around us, I cannot envision the horror of trying it in a tent.
</P>
<P>
   Images of last year's hurricanes Georges and Mitch still boggle
the mind.
</P>
<P>
   Guantanamo may be convenient to the U.S. because it presently is
lightly used and because we hold onto it because it annoys Fidel
Castro so, but as a safe haven, however temporary, for Kosovo
refugees? Even if Slobodan Milosevic relented today and the
Kosovars were allowed to return home, how quickly could that take
place? And what would they be going home to? They'd likely have to
bring those tents with them.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees are not going home any time soon, but hurricane
season is just around the corner. They are going from one harm's
way to another _ this one perhaps not as lethal as ``ethnic
cleansing'' but with a potential for great physical danger
nevertheless.

 BERLIN: airport space.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Still, as edge cities go, Potsdamer Platz is going to be pretty
fantastic. Not every edge city has a Hyatt Hotel designed by Rafael
Moneo or a theater designed by Renzo Piano on a plaza named after
Marlene Dietrich. Not every edge city is surrounded by the
Reichstag, Brandenburg Gate and the Altes Museum or sits in the
heart of one of Europe's most historically charged cities.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the three esthetic approaches governing Potsdamer Platz,
the effect is surprisingly homogeneous. This is partly the result
of design guidelines devised by Hans Stimmann, Berlin's director of
planning. Of course, anything this large put up this fast is bound
to seem artificial. The result is bound to disappoint those who
were hoping for the lively heterogeneity that prevailed here in the
1920s.
</P>
<P>
   But the new version cannot be counted an insult to the memory of
the old. In the Weimar years, the area offered a picture postcard
version of the developed industrial city. Now it is a perfected
portrait of the informational city. Its hallmark is abstraction.
This is true even of Grassi's buildings for A&AMP;T. Aldo Rossi in his
early years was not this severe. The buildings' derivation from
18th-century precedent only highlights the extent to which these
buildings have been rendered as geometrically abstract diagrams _
X-rays of the baroque.
</P>
<P>
   But people can be forgiven for regarding Potsdamer Platz as a
continuation of the wall by capitalist means. All edge cities are,
in effect, walls. Detached from older urban centers, they are
visual and psychological screens between members of the global
consumer society and those who, willingly or unwillingly, have not
signed up.
</P>
<P>
   The Info-Box, which was conceived as a temporary structure,
looks more substantial than the buildings showcased in it. Designed
by Schneider &AMP; Schumacher in 1995, the structure reckons with its
immediate urban condition. Made of red enameled steel panels, inset
with big picture windows, the box is held aloft on scaffoldlike
prongs; it resembles an enlarged version of a construction crane
cabin. Its provisional quality, simple geometry and airy defiance
of gravity embrace with perfect poise the area's prevailing mode of
abstraction. Here is a renewed version of Piano and Rogers' work
from the 1960s, when these architects, inspired by Archigram's
vision of Instant City, designed the Pompidou Center.
</P>
<P>
   The Info-Box is a walk-in video screen. Visitors take a
simulated helicopter flight over Potsdamer Platz. We learn that
virtual streets will be among the Sony Forum's featured
attractions. But won't they be redundant? How will we distinguish
the virtual streets from the real? Simply by stepping into
Potsdamer Platz, we've agreed to become virtual people _ or at
least to behave like them. We're a featured attraction ourselves:
the people in a would-be people place.
</P>
<P>
   This is preferable to being gunned down in a Death Zone. It is
also alienating, but no less valuable for that. The Weimar flaneurs
were at home with alienation. They understood it to be one of the
modern city's most poetic products.
</P>
<P>
   Checkpoint Charlie Revisited
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps the Cold War ended therefore as a result of a simple
administrative error,'' Mark Mazower writes in his recent book
``Dark Continent.'' ``More than one Western journalist claims the
credit for having posed the vital question at the 9 November press
conference in East Berlin: from when did the newly liberalized
travel regulations for East Germans _ just announced by Guenter
Schwabowski, the government's exhausted press spokesman _ come into
effect? Without instructions on this point, Schwabowski replied off
the cuff: From this moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Later he admitted the authorities had not anticipated the
rush, the emotional drive that drove thousands within hours to
Checkpoint Charlie. Bewildered border guards had no idea what to do
with them; by the time the politicians ordered them to let people
through, they had started to do so anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Philip-Johnson-Haus, an office building that now sits on the
spot occupied a decade ago by Checkpoint Charlie, is strangely
oblivious to the history of its site. It could be an emergency
airlift from the Beverly Hills stretch of Wilshire Boulevard. But
Johnson is a celebrity in Berlin, a fact exploited during
construction by the building's developer, when a huge
black-and-white billboard of the architect adorned the fence
surrounding the site. One night, some students stole the billboard.
Eventually, a ransom note turned up: ``We've kidnapped Philip
Johnson.'' Later, a package arrived containing the billboard's
severed ear.
</P>
<P>
   You know you've reached East Berlin when you come upon a little
garden enclosed by chain-link fence that contains chunks of the
wall. It's called the East Side gallery. The wall fragments are
covered with graffiti. One of them depicts an R. Crumb-style bimbo,
her hourglass figure bulging out of a devil red dress. It's a sin
to tear down history, the sexpot pouts to passers-by.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few years, West and East Berlin have evolved into
a kind of uptown-downtown division of urban life style.
Kurfuerstendamm remains the major spine for department stores,
smart shops, elegant hotels, restaurants and movie palaces. The
eastern edge of Mitte is where artists want to live. You could
imagine you were in the Marais or the Soho of an earlier day. It is
the same paradox that cultural workers dedicated to the new are
drawn to live amid the old. Buildings have been fixed up. Narrow
streets are full of galleries, shops specializing in art books,
trendy cafes. There is also a residual glamour from the Communist
years, the sense that traces of political radicalism still linger
from obsolete underground movements.

 BERLIN: underground movements.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Changing Meaning of Glass
</P>
<P>
   Berlin's flaneurs were not architecture critics. They were
mainly concerned with states of mind. They used the stimuli of
urban spectacle to heighten awareness of contradictions,
ambivalence, conflicts between repulsion and desire, the splits,
loose ends and discontinuities of the nervous system. Their
writings prefigure what would later be called urban semiotics, a
field explored by Francoise Choay, Roland Barthes, Umberto Eco and
other writers, most of them French.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Nouvel's design for Galeries Lafayette emerges from this
school of thought. Situated on Friedrichstrasse, in the former
Eastern sector, the building reflects a semiotic sense of the
relationship between inner and outer worlds. Before World War II,
Friedrichstrasse was Berlin's Fifth Avenue, the town's smartest
shopping street. After the war, that role shifted to
Kurfuerstendamm in the West. Nouvel's design is part of a larger
plan to restore Friedrichstrasse as a corridor of luxury shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Nouvel does not attempt to avoid the task of disguising
profit-taking by exciting desire. Rather, he embraces the task with
a frenzy that pushes the design into the realm of surreal comedy.
Typically, a shopping mall will adopt a unifying architectural
motif: Swiss village, high-tech or Southwestern pueblo. At Galeries
Layette, the motif is optical illusion.
</P>
<P>
   Like a mall, this building is focused on the interior. Its main
feature is a central glass atrium formed by two cones, their bases
back to back. At once transparent and reflective, the cones
resemble giant 19th-century optical devices. They fracture the
interior into a kaleidoscope of luxury, status and fashion.
Shoppers and sales counters appear to hover in the air: a trick
effect, like the images in anamorphic mirrors.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Techniques of the Observer,'' Jonathan Crary argues that
optical instruments were more than toys. These devices precipitated
new ways of seeing. Breaking with classical ideas of perception
established in the Renaissance, 19th-century scientists explored
the idea that perceptions are shaped more decisively by neural
apparatus than by the external reality the eyes behold. By the
1920s, this fragmented, disjointed way of seeing had worked itself
into the writings of the Berlin flaneurs.
</P>
<P>
   Galeries Lafayette's location in the East gives Nouvel's optical
tricks an added historical dimension. For decades, West Berlin was
sustained as a show window, a display of the material well-being
afforded by free enterprise. One can imagine the atrium as the
mental landscape of East Berliners peering over the wall into the
Western showcase, visions of cashmere, blue jeans and credit cards
dancing in their heads.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Foster's dome for the Reichstag is a powerful civic
symbol, precisely because it resembles a ghost _ an ectoplasmic
cupola for a haunted building in a town of many specters. Beehive
shaped, the glass dome harks back to the teens, when architects
like Bruno Taut believed that the replacement of masonry by glass
would help usher in a democratic utopia of transparency, freedom
and social responsibility. Colored glass destroys hatred. Glass
opens up a new age. So went two of the mottos inscribed at the base
of the dome of the Glass Pavilion that Taut designed for the 1914
Werkbund Exhibition in Cologne.
</P>
<P>
   If only. But the glass facades of Mendelsohn's Columbus Haus did
not prevent the SS from converting the building's top six floors
into a central ``protective custody'' prison. This was in March
1933, barely a month after Hindenburg signed into law the emergency
measures following the Reichstag burning. Mendelsohn's ribbon
windows were easily blocked off. His large, open floor plans could
be converted as easily to penal use or to retail, as in the
Woolworth store that occupied the ground floor. Loading bays at the
rear of Columbus Haus permitted the inconspicuous transport of
prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1933 and 1936, an estimated 600 communists, Jews,
homosexuals and other political undesirables were detained at what
was, in effect, the first Nazi concentration camp. By then,
flanerie had given way to goose steps. On the night of Nov. 9, 1938
_ Kristallnacht _ the Nazis unleashed a new symbolism for glass.
</P>
<P>
   So one sees Foster's transparent dome as, in part, a monument to
doomed utopias. It has already begun to function as a kind of Duomo
to Berlin. Visible from many distant vantage points, it gives the
city an emotional and a physical scale as well as a suitably
fractured scale of time. A spiral ramp winds within the dome.
Accessible to the public, the ramp conveys the idea that citizens
can keep an eye on government proceedings. Viewed from outside, the
spiral suggests another meaning, perhaps more apt: history does not
unfold in linear fashion. And where is the point of orientation
that would let a person or a people judge whether a turn is for
better or worse?

 BERLIN: or worse?  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Postwar Zigzag
</P>
<P>
   Given Berlin's pivotal place in the Cold War, people are
naturally looking to this city for signs of the contours a
post-Cold War world might assume. We look for cultural indicators
as well as political and economic ones, and we expect their
significance to be global. The Cold War was, among other things, a
clash of ideas, and for half a century it held the world within its
nuclear, binary embrace. By rights, the city that embodied that
clash should be bubbling over with cultural ferment.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Libeskind's Jewish Museum is as vital a cultural
expression of this time as an architecture critic can hope to find.
I approached this building with apprehension. It doesn't photograph
well. In plans, it looks fragmented, which the building itself is
not. The museum is not explicitly concerned with Cold War issues;
it is dedicated to the cultural history of Berlin's Jews. A corner
of it is consecrated to the Holocaust, but the museum draws meaning
from deep historical strata that were frozen during the Cold War. A
zigzag of concrete, steel and zinc, the building appears to reel
through time from the Enlightenment to Prussian militarism, German
Romanticism, Marxism, fascism and on into the future.
</P>
<P>
   Libeskind's building stands adjacent to the Berlin Museum in the
Kreuzberg district. The museum is in an 18th-century classical
edifice that was built as the city's high courthouse and is now
being restored under Libeskind's supervision. The Jewish Museum is
a five-story, rectangular-bar building that has been bent and
folded into a zigzag shape, with 10 sharply angled turns. The
segments veer now left, now right, now double back. They are clad
in panels of unweathered zinc that reflect the changing light of
hour, weather and season.
</P>
<P>
   The segments gradually increase in length. In height and width
they are scaled to the 18th-century building, which emphasizes the
difference in form between the two. This contrast invites the idea
that Libeskind is unfolding the irregular history that transpired
in and around Berlin's classically ordered structures. The angled
form is abstract but invites multiple meanings: a lightning bolt
(from a cloud, or an SS uniform), a jagged tear at the fabric of a
city and a civilization as well as a crude attempt to stitch the
fabric back together, a river of time, a labyrinth, the unforeseen
turns of history, a serpent, symbol of evil and wisdom both, a Star
of David sliced apart and reassembled.
</P>
<P>
   Not least, the shape evokes the flaneurs' rambling path through
the city. A wall plaque in the lobby identifies Benjamin's
``One-Way Street'' as one of Libeskind's inspirations. But like
contemporary Berlin, his building is in fact a two-way street,
steeped in memory but able to press on. The design pays its debt to
the past by resembling nothing ever before built.
</P>
<P>
   The museum's irregular plan is echoed by its windows. Slashed
into the zinc surface as if by a laser can opener, these openings
range in size and shape from small, triangular gashes to
conventional ribbon fenestration on the top floor, where the
offices are. Most of the windows take the form of long, thin
strips, sliced diagonally across the zinc, occasionally
overlapping, suggesting a series of crossroads. Though seemingly
abstract, this imagery is in fact cartographic. Libeskind has
mapped the addresses of prominent figures in Berlin's intellectual
history, Jews and non-Jews. The diagonal windows connect these
points on the city's cultural map. They evoke the city's creatively
fertile past.
</P>
<P>
   The building entrance is not visible from outside. One gains
access by descending a long staircase from inside the Berlin
Museum. The stair suggests the site of an archaeological dig. It
prepares you to encounter layers of history and emotion. And it
parallels the experience that with age we feel less and less
distant from earlier times.
</P>
<P>
   From the bottom of the stair extends a corridor, its floor
slightly raked; to the eye, it looks convexly curved, like a
roadbed. Eye and foot both relay the message that you are not
entering a place dedicated to normalcy. The lobby expands upon the
flaneur motif. Corridors lead off in several directions, past walls
resembling street blocks or triangular corners. Strips of overhead
lighting, recessed into black ceilings, suggest that in this
underground city day and night are one. Overall, these crisp but
slightly deformed spaces update Expressionist architecture and film
design: a look back at Caligari from the end of the century that
witnessed modernism's rise and fall.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the museum, you are scarcely conscious of the building's
zigzag envelope. Rather, the interior is dominated by what
Libeskind calls the Void, a series of five spaces that form a kind
of interrupted atrium. Disconnected but arranged along a single
axis, these cavities of poured concrete rise the full height of the
building and provide its organizing spine. Visitors cross through
them on bridges that connect the galleries. The void spaces are
unheated and will not be used to display art. For Libeskind, they
represent the culture that was wiped out by the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Art will be installed in the galleries later this year.
Installation will be a curatorial challenge, but this should not be
a case in which architecture overwhelms art. In this context of
geometric aberration, the galleries look almost conventional. They
are irregularly sized and shaped, and the diagonal windows
periodically interrupt the walls. But these features should counter
museum fatigue and thus assist rather than hinder viewing.
</P>
<P>
   Two parts of the museum stand outside the zinc enclosure. A
garden, named for the writer E.T.A. Hoffmann, encloses a mazelike
grid of tall, square columns that rise at a disorienting tilt from
a bed of cobblestones that is itself slightly raked. The columns
are in fact planters: a single tree sprouts from the top of each.
Hoffmann was employed as a lawyer in the courthouse, and the garden
could well be a setting for a tale of transformation. In its
perverse way it is a classical composition, one of the most poetic
expressions yet devised for the idea that columns originated as
trees fabricated in stone. In this context religious connotations
inevitably arise: an Eden and a cemetery, a paradise out of reach.
All but one of the columns contains dirt from Berlin; the other has
dirt from Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The garden's most impressive effect, however, is the optical
distortion it imposes on the surrounding cityscape. Viewed through
the lens created by the columns and ground, nearby buildings
(housing blocks from the 1960s) appear to reel back from the
street, as if buffeted by wind or taken by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Echoes and a Soul
</P>
<P>
   Libeskind was born in Lodz, not far from Chelmno, where the
first Nazi extermination center began operating in 1941. Most of
the Jews killed there came from Lodz. In his documentary film
``Shoah,'' Claude Lanzmann asks a Mrs. Michelson, the wife of a
Nazi schoolteacher in Chelmno, whether she had ever seen the gas
vans that were used there.
</P>
<P>
   ``No _ yes, from the outside,'' she says. ``They shuttled back
and forth. I never looked inside; I didn't see the Jews inside
them. I only saw things from the outside.''
</P>
<P>
   Like James Ingo Freed in his design for the U.S. Holocaust
Memorial Museum in Washington, Libeskind extracts psychological
meaning from the relationship between interior and exterior space.
In one corner of the museum, he has attempted to evoke the
experience of being inside with all possibility of escaping to the
outside foreclosed. Through a metal door, you enter a tall chamber
of gray concrete. The space is unheated and looks like something
between a chimney and an abandoned, burned-out chapel. It is dimly
lighted by a single spotlight and the diffused glow from a
concealed window at the top. There is no sound. This is what it
feels like to be incinerated by numbness, to be a living being
imprisoned within cold gray ashes.
</P>
<P>
   If Germany's new capital has a soul, it exists within this
concrete corner. The space is dedicated to the Holocaust, yet it
reverberates with other historical echoes. For example, it is a
place to reflect on the moral condition of the Weimar flaneurs. Was
there not, perhaps, something irresponsible in their attitude of
detachment, their willingness to be be dazzled by spectacle in the
pursuit of modernity? Did their passivity invite their fate? Did
their preoccupation with subjective vision render them powerless in
the face of objective political reality?
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a camera with its shutter open, quite passive, recording,
not thinking,'' Christopher Isherwood writes in ``Berlin Diary,'' a
British flaneur's record of the city in 1930. This is a chilling
attitude to profess three years before Hitler came to power. But
Isherwood intended his words to be chilling. He was, of course,
more than a camera. He wrote to convey the truth beneath the
surface of things, including his own desire for detachment.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin, Hessel and Kracauer were more than critically engaged
with the culture of their time. They belonged to its living fiber.
In the Weimar years, work like theirs gave modernity its meaning.
They gained authority thereby. Under Hitler, they paid for that
gain with exile and death. They were eliminated, that is to say,
not because they were passive observers of their times, but because
they were active participants in shaping them. They were despised
by people who, when they heard the word culture, reached for their
guns.
</P>
<P>
   The recollection of that savagery has become the starting point
for culture in the post-Cold War world. This is where the walk
resumes.

MAKERS OF FILTER SOFTWARE FIGHT OVER LISTS OF WORDS AND WEB SITES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By LISA GUERNSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Disputes over the content of words and Web sites are nothing
new. These days, they usually involve people fighting to filter
what children see on the Web, or other people fighting for their
right to speak, print or send via computer any words they like.
</P>
<P>
   Now an Internet filtering company has added a new twist to the
battle over what is banned: it is accusing another company of
stealing its list of banned words and Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The filter companies involved are Cybersitter and Clickchoice;
ICQ, an instant messaging service on the Web that once recommended
the Clickchoice filter to its users, has also been swept into the
fray. The dispute has illustrated how difficult it is for a
filtering company to keep its lists of banned words secret and
added fuel to the debate over whether such secrecy is warranted.
</P>
<P>
   Officials for Cybersitter accuse Clickchoice of using
Cybersitter's proprietary list of filtered words as the basis for
its own filtering software, which it formerly offered on line.
Clickchoice denies that. But Cybersitter is still considering a
lawsuit, said Marc Kanter, vice president for marketing at
Cybersitter's manufacturer, Solid Oak Software, based in Santa
Barbara, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict is rooted in the difficulty of setting up a filter
that blocks what is intended but does not block innocuous sites or
references that just happen to include, say, the word breast. When
a site is requested through a Web browser or search engine, most
filtering software checks the requested Web address against a list
of taboo sites. Some software, like Cybersitter's, also reads words
that have been typed into search engines and checks them against a
list of banned words. If a match is found, the search engine will
not display links to those sites. In the case of chat-room filters,
sometimes typed words _ as well as links to Web sites _ are
blocked.
</P>
<P>
   Devising a list of sites and words to ban involves many tricky
decisions. Some filters are based on specially devised formulas
that catch combinations of words and phrases; others include Web
sites that may not include words like sex or naked, yet are still
deemed to be pornographic. Most companies consider the lists they
have compiled to be precious trade secrets, hidden behind
encryption and released to no one. Even customers who download the
software onto their computers have no access to the lists that
control what sites and words are blocked; they can find out what is
included only by searching for specific terms or pages to find out
if they are filtered out.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we published the list, we would be shooting ourselves in
the foot and giving ammunition to competitors,'' said Theresa
Marcroft, a marketing director for Surf Watch, a leading Internet
filter.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute over Cybersitter's list began in March when an ICQ
user discovered that ICQ was directing customers who wanted a
filter to a site called Clickchoice.com. There, users could
download two Clickchoice filters that were designed to work with
ICQ. One of the filters blocked the appearance of some words that
many people do not consider inappropriate for children, like words
referring to gay rights. Some ICQ users were appalled that ICQ was
promoting the Clickchoice software as its filters of choice, and a
few online news organizations reported the complaints.
</P>
<P>
   The flap dissipated within a few days, as soon as ICQ stopped
linking its customers to the Clickchoice site. An ICQ spokeswoman
attributed the link to Clickchoice to an ``internal problem'' and
said ICQ was not in the business of endorsing one filter company
over another.
</P>
<P>
   A new problem emerged when Cybersitter was called by a reporter
for CNET's News.com who had reported that one of the Clickchoice
filters worked suspiciously like Cybersitter's. The reporter sent
Cybersitter a copy of Clickchoice's list of banned words, which she
had received from Peacefire, a youth group opposed to Internet
filters. The group had downloaded the Clickchoice software and
viewed its list, which, unlike those in most filters, was not
encrypted.
</P>
<P>
   That list of banned words and sites matched the list that
Cybersitter had used in creating its software two years ago, said
Kanter, of Cybersitter. He said it had become unquestionably clear
that Clickchoice had used the Cybersitter list to create its own
software.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was blatant,'' Kanter said. ``It's just amazing to us.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Joseph Provissiero, vice president of marketing
and sales at Clickchoice Co., based in Atlanta, apologized for
offending anyone with the choice of words for the company's filter
but contended that Clickchoice had ``not done anything wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Clickchoice no longer offers the ICQ filter. In
fact, Provissiero said, Clickchoice is not in the business of
creating filtering software at all. What Clickchoice is developing
is still secret, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Clickchoice's Web site is blank except for this statement: ``The
purpose for which this site was originally created is no longer
valid. Site is now being revised.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackers may have also played a role in the dispute. Kanter, of
Cybersitter, said that Clickchoice had received a copy of its
banned words after Cybersitter's list was decoded two years ago by
Peacefire.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Bennett Haselton, a Vanderbilt University graduate
student who started Peacefire, wrote a program that could decode
Cybersitter's filter. Once a person ran the decoder, a text-based
list of Cybersitter's banned words and taboo sites would appear.
Soon Cybersitter's list was being posted on Web sites around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Kanter said it was obvious that Clickchoice had got one of those
decrypted lists and used it as the basis of its ICQ software. For
example, he said, he found the words ``Don't buy Cybersitter'' in
Clickchoice's list _ words that Cybersitter added to its secret
list years ago, when an anti-filtering campaign with the slogan
``Don't buy Cybersitter'' was raging on line.
</P>
<P>
   Provissiero denies that Clickchoice's list was once
Cybersitter's. ``There were a variety of sources that were used
when the list was compiled,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other filtering companies, like Surf Watch, have also fallen
prey to hackers. Both Surf Watch and Cybersitter now use stronger
encryption to lock up their lists. But it seems that doing so only
increases the decoders' appetite for the keys. Newsgroups are
peppered with conversations among children who want to figure out
how to unblock their parents' blocking software and with advice
being passed among people who want to expose exactly which sites a
filtering company filters.
</P>
<P>
   Those opposed to the use of Internet filters in public libraries
and schools are disturbed by the secrecy surrounding blocking
software. In a recent court case involving the library board in
Loudoun County, Va., lawyers for the residents opposed to filters
asked for the right to see what words and Web sites would be
banned. X-Stop, the software company hired by the library, refused
to turn over its list, calling it a trade secret.
</P>
<P>
   That refusal became part of the plaintiffs' case against the use
of filters. The library board had argued that installing filtering
software was no different from librarians' making decisions about
what books to stock on the shelves. But Bob Corn-Revere, a lawyer
arguing against the library board, pointed out that when librarians
made decisions about books, they knew exactly what they were
deciding to include or exclude.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if they were using Internet filters,'' Corn-Revere said,
``how would they know?''
</P>
<P>
   The American Civil Liberties Union would much prefer that the
lists be made public, said Ann Beeson, an ACLU lawyer who
specializes in Internet censorship. She said she knew of only one
filter _ called Net Nanny _ that gave its customers the option of
viewing its list of banned sites and words. The rest of the
filtering companies keep their lists closely guarded.
</P>
<P>
   Such secrecy, Ms. Beeson said, ``prevents the consumer from
knowing what in the world they are buying when they buy these
products.'' Besides, she added, once lists are exposed, it becomes
clear that claims about the importance of protecting trade secrets
are ``a lot of smoke and mirrors.'' Some of them consist of little
more than a batch of profanities and descriptions of sex, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials for filtering companies vigorously disagree. They say
building these lists is arduous and time-consuming.
</P>
<P>
   Cyber Patrol, for example, employs 10 people to spend eight
hours a day at the company's headquarters in Framingham, Mass.,
reviewing Web sites culled by online robots called Web crawlers
that were built by Cyber Patrol to search for potentially offensive
material. Those researchers then categorize the Web sites into
groups like ``vio-lence/profanity'' and ``gross depictions.'' As
with other Internet filters, customers cannot see the sites that
are grouped under each category, but they can decide which
categories they want to be blocked.
</P>
<P>
   ``An intellectual process has been applied here,'' said Susan J.
Getgood, Cyber Patrol's vice president of marketing. ``The fact of
that work makes the list our intellectual property.''
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly enough, Cyber Patrol has also created a list of
sites that it says are not only safe for children but are also
designed to be educational and fun. But the company isn't taking
any pains to protect that list as its intellectual property: the
list is not protected by encryption or even sold. It's free on the
Web, for anyone to view.

A PROTEST THAT WON'T FUEL CHANGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Internet as a rallying point for causes has as much
potential for silliness as it does for seriousness. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The latest exercise in silliness is an exhortation to join
something called the ``Great Gas Out'' on April 30 to protest
soaring petrol prices. It's pitiful in a way, because it reflects
its organizers' lack of understanding of economics in general and
energy economics in particular. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The premise apparently is that if everybody stays away from
gasoline stations three weeks from Friday, this will somehow send
producers, refiners and marketers a message: Price relief is
possible if Americans stop consuming gasoline for just a day. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was just ONE day when no one purchased any
gasoline,'' says one of the e-mail recruiting messages, ``prices
would drop drastically.'' The advisory _ somewhat curiously _
further advises prospective recruits to buy gasoline either on the
Thursday before or the Saturday after. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This approach raises a question. What's the effect if everyone
buys his or her normal gasoline ration before or after? Consumption
remains the same. It just gets accelerated or delayed. If the
``Great Gas Out'' crusaders really wanted to make a difference,
they would urge a moratorium on gasoline usage. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Why don't they urge an outright consumption holiday? Can you
imagine how it would hurt the industry if a day's revenues were
lost forever? The reason this approach is shunned is probably
because it requires sacrifice. Americans are great for crusades, as
long as it's not too much of an inconvenience. Otherwise, forget
it. A consumption boycott basically means not driving or otherwise
using any gasoline-powered vehicle or other form of machinery. Talk
about inconvenience. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Beyond these considerations, there is also a question of the
crusade's point. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gasoline, contrary to what those with no appreciation of history
might think, isn't all that expensive. It's not expensive in
current dollars or inflation-adjusted dollars. At something over a
dollar a gallon, gasoline costs just about what it cost 30 years
ago in 1969 dollars. Put another way, the price of gasoline right
now pretty much reflects the rate of rise of consumer prices since
before the first oil shock of the early '70s. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you can't remember back 20 years or so, predictions for
future oil prices then implied a cost of $4 or $5 a gallon by now.
If those predictions had proved accurate, rising energy costs would
have prevented the strong economic boom and bull market. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although the cost of gasoline has surged in recent weeks, it's
still within the same price range at which it's been selling for a
decade or more. The latest blip resulted from a pact by OPEC to
curb production in an effort to reduce oil supplies and thus drive
up prices. It's only the umpteenth such agreement by OPEC, none of
which has held before. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Each time the routine is the same. The market gets jittery, oil
prices rise, gasoline prices react similarly, within a few months
some OPEC members start cheating, and shortly thereafter gas prices
fall along with oil prices. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you really want gas prices to decline, stop using the stuff.
If demand falls enough, supplies will rise and prices will fall. &QL;

YOU THINK YOUR COMMUTE IS BAD? TRY THIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEPHEN C. MILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Four hours on an interstate being tailgated by hulking
18-wheelers, cut off by speed demons in red sports cars and
surrounded by menacing sport utility vehicles with darkened windows
is good preparation for Rollcage. This new driving game from
Psygnosis, which was developed by a British company, Attention to
Detail, is the latest in the gaming genre that uses the automobile
as both a means of transportation and a means of destruction.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when the object of driving games was just to
cross the finish line first. Some of those games still sell well.
But many of the most interesting new driving games are
testosterone-heavy shoot-'em ups inspired, apparently, by road
rage.
</P>
<P>
   What makes these games, and in this case, Rollcage, so
compelling is the detail. They are a variety I call Cyber Noir
because unlike the Formula One racing games, for example, the
rendering of the cars, the tracks, the landscape and the buildings,
while stunning, tend toward the dark and moody. It matches this
kind of game's moral underpinnings _ drive fast, shoot first and
take no prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Rollcage, as the name implies, is a race car that can flip over
with no damage. In fact, the car appears to be indestructible and
can defy gravity. It can drive along walls and zip upside down on
tunnel roofs without falling, all the while blasting away with its
mounted weapons. The guns and rockets are used only to impede the
other drivers, since their cars are equally indestructible. You can
slow them down with homing missiles and ``electronic ice'' and
teleport them behind you if you hit one with the wormhole weapon.
</P>
<P>
   You can also just slow opponents down by putting obstacles in
their way. But the obstacles are collapsing buildings that you
bring down in front or on top of them with well-placed missiles.
Other obstacles include chunks of road blown away with eye-popping
fireballs and boulders that can be blasted from the side of
mountains. And then there is the old-fashioned method of simply
running them off the road.
</P>
<P>
   The game play is straightforward. You become one of seven
drivers (choosing from an ethnically diverse group of men and
women) and pick a racing environment. I say environment because
your options extend far beyond simply choosing a racetrack. You can
race in a city, by the shore, through the mountains and even on the
desolate terrain of Mars, with its lighter gravity. Each of those
four venues has four tracks, giving you 16 options. As a bonus,
four extra tracks are added randomly to the mix.
</P>
<P>
   You can race in league mode, where you have to win to advance.
Think English soccer. There are three leagues through which you
must advance, and there are 16 track options for each league. You
can race in arcade mode, where you just try to come in first _ 16
options for that. Then there is time-attack mode, where you just
try to score your own personal best time. That adds yet another way
to tackle the 16 tracks, so you can see that it might take a while
to get through all the possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   There is also multiplayer mode. Up to four players can challenge
one another on one PC by daisy-chaining joysticks. The screen shows
all four views simultaneously. You can also play up to five other
people over a LAN or on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   And there is practice mode, which you'll surely need plenty of
to gain even minimal control of the car.
</P>
<P>
   Once you do, you should start in arcade mode. I found the
Harpoon Island/Paradise scenario to be the easiest track. Of
course, easy is a relative term. Since a beach is on one side of
the track, it cuts down by half the problem of going off the track.
</P>
<P>
   But the walls on the other side are tricky. If you go up them at
the right angle, you can maintain your direction and speed as you
zoom sideways. Or you might flip over, become airborne and land
somewhere down the road. In these cars, airborne is good. It allows
you to zoom over and ahead of opponents and while you are above
them, they can't draw a bead on you.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if you mess up, you do an aerial end over end
and come down heading for the rail on the opposite side of the
road. That is not good. If you are lucky, you hit the rail, bounce
a few times, straighten the car out and resume the race behind the
pack.
</P>
<P>
   But that rarely happens. You are more likely to get smacked by
another car going 320 miles an hour, sending you spinning. The game
moves so fast that you also very quickly get turned around
completely with the dreaded ``Wrong Way'' sign flashing in your
face.
</P>
<P>
   After you complete the three laps in an arcade race, you get the
option of continuing with another race or watching an aerial view
replay of the one you just completed. Replay is instructive,
embarrassing and fun. You get to see how spectacular that crash
really was or feel inept as you watch yourself endlessly bang into
the walls of a cul-de-sac.
</P>
<P>
   Rollcage can be controlled completely by the keyboard, but I do
not recommend it. The slightest movement of the cursor keys causes
an instant response by the car. Until you spend a lot of time in
practice mode just learning to control the car, you will not be
able to keep ahead of the other cars, let alone take them out with
your weapons. You need a joystick, or even better, a steering-wheel
or force-feedback controller, to get the best out of Rollcage.
</P>
<P>
   Rollcage, which has its own Web site at www.rollcage-game.com,
picks up on another popular trend in video games: licensing music
from popular CD's or even original tracks composed by well-known
artists. Some of the music comes from the British rocker Fatboy
Slim's CD ``You've Come a Long Way Baby.''
</P>
<P>
   A caveat: the PC version of Rollcage requires a muscle machine
to work properly. The specifications call for a 233-megahertz
Pentium II with 32 megabytes of RAM and a 3-D accelerator card. I'd
crank up the memory to 64 MB or better.
</P>
<P>
   I played the game on a 400-megahertz Pentium II system with 128
megabytes of RAM and a serious sound system. Spending $3,000 for a
computer to play a $50 video game might seem excessive, but you
can't put a price tag on a good game experience.
</P>
<P>
   Rollcage, from Psygnosis; for Playstation and Windows 95 and 98;
$49.99; rated E for everyone (age 6 and up) by the Entertainment
Software Review Board.

HITCHCOCK CENTENNIAL: REMEMBERING THE MASTER OF SUSPENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, April 11)  
 The director Peter Bogdanovich is the author of ``Who the Devil
Made It: Conversations with Legendary Film Directors.'' He is
preparing two new films, ``Wait for Me'' and ``The Cat's Meow.''  
 (bl)  
 By PETER BOGDANOVICH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Knowing that Alfred Hitchcock never previewed his movies, nor
even saw them with audiences after they were released, I asked him
in 1963 (when he was 64), if he didn't ever miss hearing them
scream.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he told me with a tiny smile, ``I can hear them when I'm
making the picture.''
</P>
<P>
   The question was posed while I was preparing for the New York
Museum of Modern Art's first retrospective of Hitchcock's films in
the United States, and his answer seems all the more revealing and
relevant today, nearly two decades after his death, as the museum
begins, on Friday, April 16, its second, and more comprehensive,
retrospective.
</P>
<P>
   This four-month commemoration of Hitchcock's centennial will
present more than 50 feature films, several shorts, documentaries,
a gallery exhibition and even a Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the most famous director in movie history, Hitchcock
had a name that remains a synonym not only for suspense but for an
entire film genre.
</P>
<P>
   His response to me hints as well of his reticence and fear of
any sort of confrontation; after all, what if they didn't scream?
But it also puts into a nutshell his essential method: He made his
pictures first entirely in his head, then put them (with numerous
writers) on paper, then shot them. He said he entered ``the area of
compromise'' only when he entered the soundstage, so naturally that
means the movies he made in his head were far more satisfying to
him than the ones he actually had to complete with all those
intangibles, like actors.
</P>
<P>
   Another time I asked if it was true that he'd once said,
``Actors are cattle,'' and he replied, ``No, I said they should be
treated like cattle.'' Later, he amended himself further, saying
that many ``actors are children, and they're temperamental, and
they need to be handled gently and sometimes'' _ a pause for
emphasis _ ``slapped!'' But one way or another, he really didn't
particularly enjoy the working process, didn't like the power
actors automatically had and was often disappointed in a picture's
result, feeling that it had been miscast because of either producer
or studio interference. He once told me that Walt Disney, as a
cartoon maker, had ``the best casting: if he doesn't like an actor
he just tears him up!''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly that's what ``the master of suspense'' would have done
to Paul Newman on ``Torn Curtain'' (1967). Coming to visit during
shooting, I found Hitch sitting in his tall director's chair in a
mood of quiet outrage. What was the matter? I asked. ``Paul Newman
sent me a memo,'' he said acidly, as if it might as well have been
a letter bomb. A memo about what? ``The script!'' He was indignant.
The four-page missive had evidently dealt with all the actor's
questions or misgivings, complaining about numerous things in the
screenplay and how these would affect his character. ``His
character!'' Hitch muttered under his breath. ``I thought to
myself: `What does it matter about your character? It's just going
to be Paul Newman anyway.''' The fact that Newman was known to
write memos _ I recalled Otto Preminger telling me of the Newman
memo he got on ``Exodus'' _ did nothing to placate Hitchcock. His
was not, after all, any picture. More than whatever insult or
irritation the actor's notes gave, it was Hitchcock's having to
respond in some way that galled and even, I think, frightened him.
</P>
<P>
   But he had a positive detestation of any sort of authority,
perhaps dating back to that terrible moment when he was 5 years old
and his father _ to punish the boy for some infraction _ sent young
Alfred down to the father's friend, the chief of police, with a
note asking that the boy be put in a jail cell for five minutes to
teach him a lesson. Five minutes can be an eternity. This was long
before the days of identified child abuse, and Hitch himself told
the story only to explain his lifelong fear of the police.
Certainly that trauma would have been more far-reaching. Though he
eventually endured the strictest education _ from Jesuit teachers _
and though he said this helped him to be extremely orderly and
organized in his thinking, there was nevertheless the other, wild,
side of the man, the one that drove him to make audiences suffer in
suspense, that made him irritable and contemptuous of any power
over him.
</P>
<P>
   His longstanding friendship, and immensely profitable business
relationship, with the super-agent and Universal studio mogul Lew
Wasserman never stopped him from making snide or sarcastic comments
to me about ``the front office,'' even when that office was clearly
Wasserman's.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, there were many co-workers he admired, even a number
of actors he cared for and enjoyed. Cary Grant, James Stewart,
Grace Kelly, Ingrid Bergman, Anthony Perkins, Roscoe Lee Browne
were some he spoke of with special fondness.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the 1960s, Grant told me that Hitchcock was ``very
patient,'' and illustrated this with an anecdote about making
``Notorious'' in 1946. Evidently, Ingrid Bergman had come on the
set one morning and was simply out of it. ``We went over and over
the scene,'' Grant said, ``and she was in some sort of haze. You
know, she just wasn't there. But Hitch, he didn't say anything. He
just sat there next to the camera, pulling on his cigar. Finally,
around 11 a.m., I began to see in Ingrid's eyes that she was
starting to come around. And for the first time all morning, the
lines were coming out right. And just then Hitchcock said, `Cut.'
And I thought, What on earth is he stopping for now? Hitch just sat
and looked up at Ingrid and said, quietly, `Good morning,
Ingrid.'''
</P>
<P>
   Though certainly he was enormously successful _ his name a
household word in England in the 1930s, in America from the
mid-'40s, and an instantly recognizable personage from the mid-'50s
when his popular television series began its 11-year run _
Hitchcock often recalled the sting of certain critical remarks.
</P>
<P>
   And he never concealed his resentment for being continually
overlooked by the Oscars. When he was finally given a conciliatory
Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award for his body of work by the
academy, he quite pointedly (and amusingly) made _ after a standing
ovation _ the shortest speech in academy history: ``Thank you,'' he
said and walked right off.
</P>
<P>
   When, several years after its release, I mentioned how
delightfully satiric I felt ``North by Northwest'' was, he recalled
with an annoyed incredulity that the critic for The New Yorker had
referred to the movie as ``unconsciously funny.'' In fact, Hitch
was always extremely sensitive to any kind of criticism _ another
form of confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   It's worth recalling, in this regard, that perhaps no other
major film director had so often been written off by critics, and
generally taken so lightly and so much for granted through most of
his career. After his third English feature, ``The Lodger'' (1926),
established him as a talent to be reckoned with _ he liked to quote
the headline that appeared over one review: ``Young Man With Master
Mind'' _ his next six pictures were dismissed out of hand. After
``Blackmail'' (1929) became his and England's first talkie and a
big success, again his next six were used as examples of his
deterioration. A return to form with the original ``The Man Who
Knew Too Much'' (1934) followed by probably his best British film,
``The 39 Steps'' (1935), still did not stop critics from counting
him out for his next three; or, after his extremely popular film
``The Lady Vanishes'' (1938), from saying he had sold out by going
to Hollywood (in 1939), or subsequently from comparing unfavorably
all his American work to the British beginnings.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1950s, when the French New Wave enthroned him in
their pantheon, and later, when English-language critics like
Andrew Sarris here or Robin Wood in London or in the Modern's
monograph I prepared said that Hitchcock's American work was more
mature, complex, challenging and far superior to the British, this
was anything but common wisdom. Indeed, the opinion was considered
highly unorthodox. What! Commercial Hollywood product like
``Foreign Correspondent'' (1941), ``Shadow of a Doubt'' (1944),
``Notorious'' (1946), ``Strangers on a Train'' (1951), ``Rear
Window'' (1954), ``To Catch a Thief'' (1955), the remake of ``The
Man Who Knew Too Much'' (1956), ``North by Northwest'' (1959),
``Psycho'' (1960) better than the precious, artistic British films?
Impossible: the American Hitchcock was just a clever entertainer,
not to be taken seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it wasn't until Francois Truffaut's marathon interview
book, ``Hitchcock,'' published in the United States in 1967, that
the establishment view began to shift, and the deeper, more
ambiguous and troubling resonance of his work began to be
understood. It was, however, almost the end of his career; he made
only three more films.
</P>
<P>
   Truffaut's book had a much better title in France, the literal
translation being ``The Cinema According to Hitchcock'' (as in
``The Gospel According to . . . '') and, in fact, Hitch could have
been an extraordinarily brilliant professor, which is the attitude
he adopted with disciples like Truffaut and me: he seemed to derive
pleasure laying down his view of the way movies should be made,
what was good cinema and what wasn't. And his advice, his
perceptions, his basic rules all made an enormous impact on
Truffaut as they did on me and many others. Would that more
filmmakers today had his passion for precision and paid attention
to what Hitchcock put forth so clearly about the craft of this art.
</P>
<P>
   His famous maxim, for example, about the superiority of suspense
over shock reverberates into every aspect of picture-making and is
today the single least heeded and most needed.
</P>
<P>
   As he once explained it to me: ``We come to our old analogy of
the bomb. You and I sit here talking. We're having a very innocuous
conversation about nothing. Boring. Doesn't mean a thing. Suddenly,
boom! A bomb goes off and the audience is shocked _ for 15 seconds.
Now you change it. Play the same scene, show that a bomb has been
placed there, establish that it's going to go off at 1 p.m. _ it's
now a quarter of one, ten of one _ show a clock on the wall, back
to the same scene. Now our conversation becomes very vital, by its
sheer nonsense. Look under the table! You fool! Now the audience is
working for 10 minutes, instead of being surprised for 15
seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   Another well-known, yet generally misunderstood, rule of
Hitchcock's has nevertheless become fairly proverbial in the
picture business _ the MacGuffin (which got its name from an old
English shaggy-dog joke). ``A MacGuffin is something that the
characters worry about but that the audience does not. You've got
to have it in a spy story, but it really doesn't matter. In `North
by Northwest,' I sort of bleached it out to its minimum. Cary Grant
says, `What's this man up to?' And Leo G. Carroll answers, `Well,
let's say he's an importer and exporter. What of? Government
secrets.' That was enough. But a lot of people think the MacGuffin
is the most vital thing in a picture _ and it's the least
important.''
</P>
<P>
   He was at his most exciting, most riveting, describing sequences
he planned to shoot _ so vividly that you could see the scenes,
shot for shot, as he took you through them. Even if he'd already
made the film years before, his unbridled enthusiasm for the
visual, as he spoke of its how and why, was contagious. His eyes
would sparkle, his large hands molding the shape of each frame, his
intonation sharp and evocative. You couldn't help being swept along
by the palpable joy of his telling. He would become a wonderfully
mischievous boy at those times, the years slipping away to reveal a
true child of the movies, born to be a crucial part of this amazing
new medium that was almost exactly as old as he was.
</P>
<P>
   My own favorite memory of Hitchcock comes from an incident at
the St. Regis Hotel in New York in 1964. After some frozen
daiquiris had left me a bit tipsy and Hitch quite red-faced and
cheerful, we got on the elevator at the 25th floor and rode in
silence to the 19th, where, when three people dressed for the
evening entered, he suddenly turned to me and said, ``Well, it was
quite shocking, I must say there was blood everywhere!'' I was
confused, thinking that because of the daiquiris I'd missed
something, but he just went right on: ``There was a stream of blood
coming from his ear and another from his mouth.'' Of course,
everyone in the elevator had recognized him but no one looked over.
Two more people from the 19th floor entered as he continued: ``Of
course, there was a huge pool of blood on the floor and his clothes
were splattered with it. Oh! It was a horrible mess. Well, you can
imagine . . . '' It felt as if no one in the elevator, including
me, was breathing. He now glanced at me, I nodded dumbly, and he
resumed: ``Blood all around! Well, I looked at the poor fellow and
I said, `Good God, man, what's happened to you?'' And then, just as
the elevator doors opened onto the lobby, Hitchcock said, ``And do
you know what he told me?'' and paused. With reluctance, the
passengers now all moved out of the elevator and looked anxiously
at the director as we passed them in silence. After a few foggy
moments, I asked, ``So what did he say?'' And Hitch smiled
beatifically and answered, ``Oh, nothing _ that's just my elevator
story.''

YOUNG SURVIVORS OF EVIL SHARE THEIR STORIES

 By RANDY GENER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With reports of killings by Serbian forces crowding
the headlines as hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanians are
forced out of their homes in Kosovo, Yolanda King can't help but
recall the suffering she saw on her travels with the Children of
War theater project.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all flooding back now as I watch the news,'' said Ms.
King, who is haunted by the memory of displaced Bosnian women she
met three years ago in refugee camps. ``We ran into an old woman
who did not know where her children were. She was delirious in her
pain.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. King felt the hardest hit emotionally in Cambodia. ``I
spent time with a woman who had watched all the men in her family
get killed or taken away and never return,'' she said. ``The
parallels were so striking.'' Ms. King was 12 in 1968, when her
father, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., was assassinated in
Memphis. ``There was a period in my family,'' she added, ``when we
kept losing all our black men: my father, his brother, his oldest
cousin, my father's brother's oldest son. They died one after the
other, all of it happening prior to their turning 40.''
</P>
<P>
   From Tuesday through Sunday at the Asia Society, Ms. King will
share the stage with five actors in the world premiere of a
90-minute multimedia performance piece titled ``The Road Home:
Stories of Children of War.'' It dramatizes interviews with
survivors of war and social conflicts from Bosnia and Cambodia to
America's inner cities.
</P>
<P>
   Individual experiences are recounted by the actors from a script
by James Lecesne. Film footage by Barbara Kopple, who made the
movie ``Harlan County, U.S.A.,'' shows displaced people in
Yugoslavia and Cambodia, stone sculptures at Angkor Wat, Tibetan
refugees in Dharamsala, India, and an interview Ms. King held with
the Dalai Lama. The music has been composed, and is performed live,
by Nawang Khechog, a Tibetan.
</P>
<P>
   The nearly four-year project was conceived and is directed by
Lawrence Sacharow, chairman of the theater department at Fordham
University. The sponsor of the piece is the River Arts Repertory
Company, which Sacharow originally founded in Woodstock, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Road Home'' was inspired by the work of Children of War, a
nonprofit organization that existed from 1983 to 1994. It was set
up, Sacharow said, to ``bring together young survivors from
war-torn countries all over the world to tell their stories to one
another for purposes of healing and developing youth leaders.'' The
organization itself was inspired by the life of Arn Chorn, now 28,
a Cambodian _ portrayed in the play _ who eventually escaped from
the Khmer Rouge as a child. The two research trips abroad were
financed by the Rockefeller Foundation, the Trust for Mutual
Understanding and the Asian Cultural Council.
</P>
<P>
   Sacharow, who directed the Pulitzer Prize-winning production of
Edward Albee's play ``Three Tall Women,'' said he had asked Lecesne
to do the final script because he had seen a videotape of Lecesne's
1995 one-man show ``Word of Mouth,'' in which the actor and writer
impersonated a variety of characters. ``I loved the language and
humanity in it,'' Sacharow said, noting that Lecesne also has a
background in Buddhism.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Road Home'' focuses on the Buddhist goal of compassion,
the director said. ``Because the stories of the people in the play
are about violence, we want to make it a journey through the
violence, so that one feels compassion for all living beings who
have suffered.'' Another goal, he said, was to visit the Dalai
Lama, ``to interview him around the Buddhist teachings of
compassion in relation to violence in the world today.''
</P>
<P>
   The cast includes Priya Ayyar, who portrays Bosnian and
Cambodian women; Steve Harrison, as an American writer and
researcher; Ken Leung, who plays Chorn, and Wendy vanden Heuvel, as
a Holocaust survivor in a nursing home in New York. Ms. King and
Daniel Carlton, who was born in Harlem and is an AIDS activist and
an actor, portray themselves.
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Ayyar, who was born in India, the project represents a
labor of love and a personal journey. ``This has been a very
emotional process,'' she said. ``Our original vision was: How on
earth can we take these stories and present them in a theatrical
way that moves people to a state of compassion?''
</P>
<P>
   What makes it more difficult, Lecesne said, is ``our natural
disavowal of evil in our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People have such a reflex to make the experience of suffering
the Other,'' he said. ``It happens over there. It does not concern
me. It's something that's so foreign.''
</P>
<P>
   But eventually, Ms. Ayyar said: ``I came to learn that I can do
nothing for someone who has suffered so much except to listen.
There is power in that. The act of listening speaks of
compassion.''
</P>
<P>
   Khechog, the composer, who was 3 when his family fled Tibet,
described the play as ``like a rough sea raging with waves,
disturbances and cyclones; yet deep down, the ocean is still and
calm.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what,'' he said, ``human beings reserve a space for
compassion and love. I try to create music that expresses that
sense of chaos and pain but at the same time the desire for hope
and peace.''
</P>
<P>
   The play's effect, said Sacharow, hinges on the connections
among suffering men, women and children everywhere. ``It's
important that nobody be a victim,'' he said during a rehearsal.
``When you're telling these stories, it must come from the point of
view of strength. And the heightened physicality of that onstage
will say: `Yes, I've seen these things and that's why I'm here. I
must investigate it. I'm not victimized by it.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Road Home,'' all the performers agreed, is less about what
evil does to people than what survivors have done in the face of
evil.
</P>
<P>
   In Lecesne's text, Arn Chorn says:
</P>
<P>
   ``War makes place mute.
</P>
<P>
   War takes what is specific and flattens it,
</P>
<P>
   Makes it gone,
</P>
<P>
   War chips the landscape until you could be anywhere,
</P>
<P>
   A kind of nowhere _
</P>
<P>
   Bosnia. Cambodia. Just places. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Dull, general, nonspecific. Gray. Gone. . . .
</P>
<P>
   What I survived is unique, yes,
</P>
<P>
   but I am not that special.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody has a Pol Pot in them; everybody has Buddha.''

<P>
   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina -- Since the airstrikes began,
Bosnians have anxiously listened for the sound of NATO planes that
fly over every day on the way to neighboring Yugoslavia. Many
observers worry the conflict next door holds more than noise for
this still war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict is hardening ethnic divisions, causing worry that
it could cause Bosnian Serbs to try to secede from the country and
join Yugoslavia. That would mean the end of the Dayton Peace
Accords.
</P>
<P>
   The International Crisis Group, a policy research group working
in Bosnia, warned Tuesday (CQ) of the potential crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not saying there is going to be an insurrection,'' said
Bryan Hopkinson, Bosnia director for the International Crisis
Group. ``We're just saying that the forces are right for one. . .
Conditions are more favorable now than they have ever been.''
</P>
<P>
   The growing tension is clear in the increasingly violent attacks
on the
</P>
<P>
   international community. Grenades have destroyed several
international vehicles and rioters have attacked three embassies
and several international offices.
</P>
<P>
   Within the past few days, a civilian working with the NATO-led
Stabilization Force was shot in the leg. A rocket-propelled grenade
was launched at a Stabilization Force helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NATO actions (n Yugoslavia) have caused the most critical
moment for us since the Dayton agreement was signed,'' said Branko
Todorovic, president of the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights
office in the Serb-controlled region of Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very risky time for us. It is no exaggeration to say
that this could be catastrophic for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the Dayton Peace Accords created two states in Bosnia, the
Serb
</P>

THE NEW BERLIN: ON THE CITY'S STAGES, AN EMBARRASSMENT OF (NOT

<P>
   BERLIN _ For classical-music lovers in New York, Berlin's
orchestra is the Berlin Philharmonic.
</P>
<P>
   For music lovers in Berlin, the picture is more complicated. The
Philharmonic is the city's leading orchestra, to be sure, but its
counterpart in East Berlin, the Berlin Symphony Orchestra _ not to
be confused with the Berliner Symphoniker in the West _ also plays
to near-capacity audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin,
formerly the Radio Symphony Orchestra of Berlin, and its older,
Eastern counterpart, the Rundfunk Sinfonie-Orchester Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   There are also specialty orchestras, like the Akademie fuer Alte
Musik and the Berlin Baroque Orchestra. And the orchestras of the
city's three opera houses all give concerts of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Reunified Berlin is bursting at the seams with music. And not
just music. As a condition of German reunification in 1990, the
West was obliged to preserve the cultural institutions of the East.
Partly as a result, Berlin now has, in addition to all those
orchestras and the three opera houses, six major subsidized
repertory houses for spoken theater and several private theaters.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of these groups are presenting the same or similar
repertory. They are also being financed from the same pot. Berlin's
government doles out some $400 million a year to more than 100
cultural institutions. In the sober financial climate of the late
1990s, many have questioned whether Berlin ``needs'' so much music
and theater, or can afford it.
</P>
<P>
   Does Berlin need three opera houses? Yes, said the great
conductor Otto Klemperer in the 1930s (for Berlin boasted three
opera companies before the city was ever divided), on the condition
that all three maintain high artistic quality. Whether that
condition is being fulfilled today is moot.
</P>
<P>
   There is a certain hardening of the arteries in Berlin's opera
administrations. The stage director Goetz Friedrich, for instance,
is 68, and has led the Deutsche Oper Berlin for 17 years. Many of
his productions seem as tired as he must be. Harry Kupfer, another
renowned stage director and longtime director of the Komische Oper
Berlin, staged 19 of the company's 31 productions this season; the
Komische Oper is Berlin's equivalent of the New York City Opera in
terms of singers, and the young casts can be good, but Kupfer, too,
seems to be recycling old ideas. The third opera house (where
Kupfer also works) is the Deutsche Staatsoper Berlin, which, under
the direction of Daniel Barenboim, has reclaimed its prewar
position as the city's flagship opera, receiving the biggest
subsidy of the three houses and playing the fewest nights.
</P>
<P>
   The opera directors have not distinguished themselves through
their willingness to compromise. Ever since people began asking
whether one of the houses might have to close after reunification,
each has viewed the others as potential rivals in a fight to the
death. (Friedrich, seeming particularly resentful, used to
mispronounce Barenboim's name consistently as a sign of his
displeasure.) Rather than trying to develop a distinctive profile
for his house, each has tried to show that he can do standard
repertory better than the others. This season, all three companies
are presenting Mozart's ``Zauberfloete'' and Verdi's ``Falstaff.''
</P>
<P>
   One-third of all the money Berlin spends on culture goes to
these three theaters. It is not inappropriate, therefore, for the
Berlin senator for cultural affairs to step in. Most German
cultural institutions are government organizations, and the person
ostensibly responsible for orchestrating cultural life in Berlin is
a political appointee. But there is no law that says that the
cultural senator has to know a lot about art. The present senator,
Peter Radunski, is a career politician. He is meeting with the
opera directors regularly to help them discuss programming, as he
puts it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Staatsoper should focus on the pre-Classical repertoire,''
he said of theater that now specializes in Wagner as well as
pre-Classical music. ``The Deutsche Oper should have more
contemporary music: a lot of Henze, Enescu. And in general there
should be more Richard Strauss. After all, he was a Berlin
composer.'' Responding to a quizzical look from his interlocutor,
he amended the Strauss part: ``Well, he lived here.''
</P>
<P>
   The relationship between art and politics is complicated. When
Radunski's predecessor, Ulrich Roloff-Momin, the first cultural
senator of the reunited Berlin, took office in 1991, a big part of
his job was helping former East German institutions make the
transition to the Western system. But by 1994, the national
government had cut off the extra money it had pumped into the city
to ease reunification, and the job became less about supporting the
arts than about cutting back on them. Something had to go.
</P>
<P>
   That something was the Schiller Theater, the main repertory
theater in West Berlin. The Schiller's audiences were dwindling
while the theaters in the East _ the Berliner Ensemble, the
Volksbuehne and the Deutsches Theater _ were starting to boom, but
the press didn't care. In the impassioned outcry that arose around
the nation, the Schiller Theater became an emblem of all that was
good and true, and Roloff-Momin _ who had, in fact, brought to his
job considerable understanding and appreciation of the creative
process _ became the epitome of philistinism and ignorance, doomed
to go down in German history as the Schiller Killer.
</P>
<P>
   Those who had complained about Roloff-Momin may have wanted him
back when Radunski took office with his new broom in 1996. Radunski
had big ideas about streamlining and combining Berlin's cultural
institutions to save money. But his proposals were like engineering
blueprints, bringing institutions together on paper without taking
into account their personalities or artistic qualities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to fuse the orchestra of the Komische Oper and the
Berlin Symphony, because they're both Eastern orchestras,'' he
said. ``But it didn't work.'' Fortunately, one might add, since
each orchestra has its own profile, function and audience.

 &HT;    ETHNIC TENSION BUILDS IN BOSNIA
 &HT;    Moving in (i) international and (w) Washington categories

   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina -- Since the airstrikes began,
Bosnians have anxiously listened for the sound of NATO planes that
fly over every day on the way to neighboring Yugoslavia. Many
observers worry the conflict next door holds more than noise for
this still war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict is hardening ethnic divisions, causing worry that
it could cause Bosnian Serbs to try to secede from the country and
join Yugoslavia. That would mean the end of the Dayton Peace
Accords.
</P>
<P>
   The International Crisis Group, a policy research group working
in Bosnia, warned Tuesday (CQ) of the potential crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not saying there is going to be an insurrection,'' said
Bryan Hopkinson, Bosnia director for the International Crisis
Group. ``We're just saying that the forces are right for one. . .
Conditions are more favorable now than they have ever been.''
</P>
<P>
   The growing tension is clear in the increasingly violent attacks
on the
</P>
<P>
   international community. Grenades have destroyed several
international vehicles and rioters have attacked three embassies
and several international offices.
</P>
<P>
   Within the past few days, a civilian working with the NATO-led
Stabilization Force was shot in the leg. A rocket-propelled grenade
was launched at a Stabilization Force helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NATO actions (n Yugoslavia) have caused the most critical
moment for us since the Dayton agreement was signed,'' said Branko
Todorovic, president of the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights
office in the Serb-controlled region of Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very risky time for us. It is no exaggeration to say
that this could be catastrophic for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the Dayton Peace Accords created two states in Bosnia, the
Serb
</P>
<P>
   Republic and the Muslim/Croat Federation, international
officials have been trying to get the states to work together like
a country. The NATO conflict in Yugoslavia has stymied that effort
and brought out the worst in the local political leaders.
Politicians on each side have accused the other of mobilizing
military forces to join in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The Stabilization Force, which monitors both states' militaries,
denies either is mobilizing. But the accusations are a startling
reminder of the pre-war propaganda here, when the nationalist
parties warned their members that the other ethnic groups were
preparing to
</P>
<P>
   slaughter them.
</P>
<P>
   The Serb Republic was already in a political crisis when NATO
began bombing Yugoslavia. Two weeks before the airstrikes started,
Bosnia's international supervisor fired the hard-line, anti-western
president of the Serb Republic. The same day, an international
arbitrator decided that Brcko, a strategic port town, should become
a special district, taking control of it from the Serbs and
effectively splitting the Serb Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Those two events sparked demonstrations throughout the Serb
Republic. Serb officials withdrew from posts in the national
government in protest.
</P>
<P>
   After the bombing began, the protests became more violent, and
the Serb Republic information minister last week warned there might
be attempts to secede from Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   (optional trim follows)
</P>
<P>
   The violence had already forced most international officials and
aid workers to abandon the region, a fact that worries opposition
leaders like Todorovic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very bad that the international community left,''
Todorovic said. ``It is a victory for the ultranationalists here.''
</P>
<P>
   (optional trim ends)
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, Stabilization Force soldiers got in a gun
fight with two
</P>
<P>
   civilians, one of whom was killed. The soldiers were destroying
a stretch of railway in eastern Bosnia that's the only line linking
Belgrade to Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   Serb politicians immediately accused the Stabilization Force of
violating Bosnia's neutrality.
</P>
<P>
   The incident also concerned international officials working in
the Serb
</P>
<P>
   Republic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got enough problems right now,'' said one political
adviser who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ``Why did they
have to pick the five miles of track in Bosnia when they've got
miles and miles in Yugoslavia? It flies in the face of everything
they're saying about Bosnia being neutral.''
</P>
<P>
   Stabilization Force officials said the rail line was being used
or was about to be used to transport forces to Montenegro, a
violation of Bosnia's neutrality. And officials confirmed that
Yugoslav soldiers were seen in the area during the gunfight.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the uproar, diplomats like David Owen, European
Union's special negotiator here during the war, are suggesting
Bosnia should just be divided along ethnic lines, with the eastern
part of the Serb Republic given to Yugoslavia in exchange for
independence for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   (optional trim follows)
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of the crisis, international officials continue to
``cajole, push and encourage,'' Serb officials to resume their
posts in the national government, according to Simon Haselock,
spokesman for international supervisors. But their task is a tough
one.

 BERLIN: and audience.  
<TEXT>

</P>
<P>
   Another example of Radunski's idea of streamlining is the Berlin
Ballet. The new company, 120 members strong, combines the ballet
companies of the three opera houses. Thirty dancers will be
available on some quasi-permanent basis to the Deutsche Oper Berlin
and its chief choreographer, Angelin Preljocaj, and 30 more to the
Komische Oper and Richard Wherlock; 60 will be based at the
Staatsoper, which, to make up for its superior numbers, will have
no resident choreographer.
</P>
<P>
   The equation is nicely balanced. But it seems like a recipe for
providing the city with adequate ``dance product,'' as if the arts
were no more than a social service that existed to cover the needs
of the public.
</P>
<P>
   Not that fusions can't work. Berlin's museums have managed to
grow together impressively. In 1990, there were 14 museums in West
Berlin, 12 in the East; the city found itself with two museums of
Islamic art, two painting galleries, two Egyptian museums and so
on. Today, there are 17 museums all told, with no repetitions.
Berlin's Old Masters have been moved from their former homes, East
and West, to a new central building, opened in 1998, near the
Philharmonie. The real work left to do is on Museum Island, in the
Spree River in East Berlin, where the museums ``still look like
1945,'' according to Michael Naumann, the new German culture
minister. All are undergoing renovation.
</P>
<P>
   Museums could fuse more easily than theaters, because there was
a general director for all the city's museums, who oversaw the
mergers of the collections. An overall general intendant might be
able to ease the deadlock in the city's theaters, particularly the
opera houses.
</P>
<P>
   What Berlin is getting instead is yet anther political
administrator responsible for supervising the apportioning of
funds, in the person of Naumann. The extent and nature of his role
remains to be seen. But Berlin, as the new capital, will receive
$65 million more a year in federal cultural subsidies, and Naumann
will surely have some say in their distribution.
</P>
<P>
   Naumann tries to be clear about the limits of his power. ``The
cultural sovereignty of Berlin remains with Berlin,'' he said.
``Personnel decisions are made by Radunski. Instead of co-financing
little things, the government will come in on larger things. It's
tricky. Where we co-finance, we want to be listened to, but I
cannot and should not exceed my authority.''
</P>
<P>
   The big question is how far Naumann's role will intersect with
that of the cultural senator. So far, Naumann and Radunski have
presented a public facade of harmonious collaboration. Naumann can
afford to be generous, since city elections are coming up in a few
months, and Radunski is widely expected to lose his seat in the
senate.
</P>
<P>
   For Radunski, this uncertain future is additional incentive to
move quickly on the ``personnel decisions'' that are among the most
significant part of a cultural senator's job. The various
appointments give the senator a lasting influence not unlike that
of a U.S. president appointing justices of the Supreme Court
(though without the politically charged confirmation hearings);
Radunski may be shaping civic culture for years to come. A whole
string of contracts come up for renewal in the near future _
Friedrich's at the Deutsche Oper expires in 2001, and Kupfer's and
Barenboim's expire in 2002 _ and Radunski intends to put successors
in place.
</P>
<P>
   Today, an institution's director has become central, even
decisive, to its identity. In Berlin's confusion of orchestras, for
instance, the conductor's name is all that enables an outsider to
remember the difference between the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester
(Kent Nagano) and the Berlin Symphony Orchestra (Eliahu Inbal). But
finding big names can in turn become a stand-in for meaningful
cultural policy.
</P>
<P>
   And the names under discussion for Berlin's various cultural
posts are not really new. Radunski's pool for new opera intendants
reportedly includes familiar figures who have held similar
positions elsewhere: Udo Zimmermann, in Leipzig; Peter Rusicka, in
Hamburg, and John Dew, in Dortmund. Even the Berlin Philharmonic,
in its search for a new conductor to replace Claudio Abbado, is
looking at all the usual suspects, from Franz Welser-Moest to
everybody's favorite candidate of the moment, Simon Rattle. Its
wish list seems hardly different from that of the Philadelphia
Orchestra, which is also in the search process.
</P>
<P>
   Naumann warns against looking for salvation from one person or
from an all-knowing government, and he and Radunski agree as to the
need for restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   Yet given the deeply entrenched nature of the system, the
difficulties of instituting change in a bureaucracy and the
attendant potential for political liability, far-reaching
structural changes seem a long way off.
</P>
<P>
   It is more likely that Berlin will maintain status quo: a
cultural life of rich diversity, tempered, at least in classical
music and opera, with an overriding aftertaste of mediocrity.

THE NEW BERLIN: `CABARET' DAYS ARE GONE; NOW IT'S SHADES OF GRAY

<P>
   BERLIN _ The Image: Trapped on a plane a few years ago, I
decided to start watching the film ``Company Business'' when the
opening credits faded and a title saying ``Berlin'' came on the
screen. After all, I was flying to the United States from Berlin,
so I was curious. The film wasn't actually made here, as soon
became obvious. But the reason I gave up on it was an early scene
involving Gene Hackman and Mikhail Baryshnikov, playing a CIA agent
and a KGB agent, respectively. They were in a situation in which
they needed to make a phone call. Hackman spotted a bar, an
ordinary enough looking place, and went in. Suddenly, there were
Barbra Streisand, Dolly Parton, Liza Minelli and Diana Ross. And in
the spotlight, crooning, was Marlene Dietrich as Lola in ``Blue
Angel.'' Drag queens all, leering at poor Gene.
</P>
<P>
   Just another bar on some side-street in Berlin, the film was
saying. And it's true: ever since the days of the Weimar Republic,
the city has had that sort of reputation, as a place with a seedy
netherworld lurking behind every door.
</P>
<P>
   The Reality: It was about 11 on a cold night some four months
ago, and I was out with a friend who is a rising star on Berlin's
art scene. If anybody would know where the art and club scenes
converged, the subject of much talk in the local press, she would.
We had had a late dinner in the Mitte district and were looking for
somewhere to go when I remembered that it was the opening night at
Bauhuette Gemuetlichkeit, the latest project by Canadian artist
Laura Kikauka, and we were just a few blocks away. Ms. Kikauka and
her husband, Gordon Monahan, have taken over a number of sites
temporarily, filled them with a bewildering array of artsy kitsch
and run an informal (which is to say, illegal) bar. Onstage,
Monahan plays an electronic organ and singers render a variety of
songs as bad lounge music. The pair calls the concept irritainment.
</P>
<P>
   The place was packed. We fought our way to the bar and then,
feeling claustrophobic, to the back of the room. A few minutes
later, the ridiculous music got to us, so we knocked back our
drinks and left. ``Isn't Loop somewhere around here?'' my friend
asked. In fact, it was, in another building in the complex. Loop is
a room created by a group of artists dedicated to ambient
soundscapes, and I'd always wanted to visit it. When we arrived, we
opened the door on a dimly lighted room with a few people lounging
on cushions, holding bottles of Beck's while a record (a scratchy
one, at that) played on a turntable making some indeterminate
sounds. We lasted about a minute there.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, I know a place,'' my friend said. This one was also nearby
and was harder to get into because we had to squeeze through a tiny
hole in a wall to reach the front door. Here, at least, the crowd
density was tolerable, and two DJs were working hard on a pair of
turntables, albeit to no great effect. My friend knew some of the
artists there, so she made the rounds while I watched the lights go
out intermittently: the club was in an old East German building,
and the wiring was faulty.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, my friend returned. ``Well, this is it,'' she said.
``The most underground place in Berlin. Fascinating, isn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sophisticated,'' I replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hot center of Europe,'' she said, deadpan.
</P>
<P>
   Collapsing in giggles, we squeezed back through the wall and
found a cab.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, we're cynical, jaded, not to mention a bit older (she's in
her mid-30s and I'm even older) than the average 20-something
patron of the places we'd visited, but there are times when the
reputation of Berlin's artistic underground seems as silly to me as
Gene Hackman's drag-queen bar.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to deny that there is a scene here, although, as the
recent collection of mediocre art at the Berlin Biennale showed,
it's not quite as interesting as one might hope. It's also not to
deny that there is a history here, post-Wall, of era-defining
cultural change, particularly in art and fringe pop music. It's
just that it's not as thrilling, perhaps, day to day.
</P>
<P>
   It was music that gave the underground its initial shot in the
arm. In the months before the Wall came down a decade ago, the
techno scene in Berlin was beginning in small clubs in West Berlin,
but it wasn't until some entrepreneurial spirits crossed east after
November 1989 that it really took off. In the last days of the East
German regime, many buildings that the government had scheduled for
demolition were merely taken off the list, and as a result a large
number of buildings were left standing that didn't exist on paper.
Squatters quickly turned these spaces into clubs. An old power
plant that had been abandoned for years became E-Werk, while the
basement of a bombed-out bank building of which only one floor
above ground remained, was turned into Tresor-Globus. The artists
whose work flourished in these clubs _ which put Berlin on the
international musical map _ came from Detroit (where techno
originated) and, surprisingly, both East and West Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   There were no signs out front to mark these places for visitors:
like most of the interesting bars and clubs I have gone to in the
five years I have lived here, they were illegal, having foregone
the health and other licenses required by the local authorities.
(Both E-Werk, which is now closed, and Tresor-Globus subsequently
became legal, as has Bauhuette Gemuetlichkeit). Places like these
are necessarily temporary, often cropping up in the spring and
lasting until the weather turns cold, then vanishing.
</P>
<P>
   They show up in the most unlikely places: I remember one, run by
Brazilians, which was literally a hole in the ground. In the middle
of a lot covered with the rubble left by bombs, one could see a
tiny light. It was a candle, placed at the top of a stairway, which
led to the building's cellar. Other candles led to a door, and
through it was the club. Apparently there was live Brazilian music
some nights, but the real attraction was the caipirinha cocktails,
available there three years before they became de rigeur on the
scene. This was a good thing: most illegal clubs seem to serve
nothing but Beck's, for some reason.
</P>
<P>
   Nor are these places all in the east: four summers ago, the hot
place was Hop Sing, named after the cook on the television show
``Bonanza.'' The club, which was in the basement of an office
building in the Kreuzberg district in west Berlin, was meticulously
tricked-out as a barroom from the American Old West, complete with
swinging doors and an odd selection of country music on the sound
system. The first-time visitor was warned that the location of the
club was top secret. Not secret enough: the building's owner,
originally enthusiastic about it, saw how successful the club
became and raised the rent eightfold. Hop Sing passed on.
</P>
<P>
   Secrecy, though, is a real concern. One owner of an illegal
club, an American, told me that he did not want his club mentioned
in print. (Although he didn't particularly like the idea, he said
he did know guys who beat people up for money.) The reason was
simple: he had a lot of his own money invested in the place, and
that summer the police were poring over the local media, checking
club names against a list of legal ones. The owner feared that a
raid would mean the end of his club, and, possibly, his stay in
Berlin. (In a bizarre coda, the club subsequently became legal only
to be torched late last year by persons unknown.)
</P>
<P>
   Not all illegal spaces became clubs, though: some were turned
into galleries or performance spaces. Often, the public space would
be on the ground floor, with the artists living as squatters on the
floors above. Even the buildings in East Berlin that were legal
were cheap, and the Mitte and Prenzlauer Berg districts attracted
artists from around the world. As with the clubs, a number of these
spaces eventually became legal (an easier process for them because
there were fewer heath-code restrictions, although last year the
process for becoming legal was greatly simplified for clubs and
bars, too), and a scene was born.
</P>
<P>
   Because the artists' spaces and the clubs existed in the same
legal limbo, it was inevitable that the two cultures would move
closer together. The first fusion I became aware of was the initial
`` . . . und ab die Post!'' _ an exhibit of the work of young
artists in an ornate former post office building on Oranienburger
Strasse _ two years ago. Each night, a different club event was
held. This exhibit was sponsored by the Aktionsgalerie, which is
down the street from the post office building. It is hardly your
typical gallery, since it looks like a bar, and, in fact, is one.
In the cellar, however, some of Berlin's most interesting art shows
have been held, while upstairs in the bar, on weekends, there is
frequently a DJ or other live performance.
</P>
<P>
   The art-club fusion gained attention internationally for the
first time at the 1997 Venice Biennale. The Art Club Berlin had a
space, designed by artists, in which DJs performed in the evenings,
and many critics thought it was the most innovative thing at the
event. (It will return this year). By now, it has become almost
unthinkable in some circles to have a gallery or show opening
without a DJ or some electronic musicians.
</P>
<P>
   Ina Wudtke is a 30-year-old who is something of a Renaissance
woman: an artist, DJ and publisher of Neid, a magazine of
avant-garde writings on gender and identity. ``I do art when art
pays, DJ when DJing pays, and use the money for the magazine,'' she
said. ``But I must say, it's frustrating when you're working the
turntables, trying to get people to dance, and they're staring at
screens.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a good thing that the art crowd has arrived, however,
because back in clubland, the once-monolithic techno scene has long
ago shattered into dozens of micro-genres and record sales have
gone nearly flat. There is no longer any center to the scene since
E-Werk closed two years ago and the once-underground Love Parade,
both a parade and a club festival held the second weekend in July,
has become a major pop event attracting 2 million people from
everywhere in Europe to Berlin's clubs. The events have become
thoroughly commercialized; they are announced on posters with so
many corporate logos that it's hard to figure out at times who's
playing.
</P>
<P>
   But it's the nature of undergrounds, especially those that
flourish, to become mainstream. So as Berlin's art-club scene moves
inexorably in that direction, no doubt something else is fermenting
in a back courtyard somewhere in the Friedrichshain district, a new
hot center of activity. As the weather warms up, my friends and I
will probably go there to investigate. And with a warm Beck's in my
hand, I'll no doubt be torn between fascination and wondering what
all the shouting's about. That, too, is a hallmark of the Berlin
underground.

THE NEW BERLIN: A PHOENIX RISES FROM THE RUBBLE OF HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ No major European city displays its fractured history
more visibly than Berlin. In just the 19th and 20th centuries, it
was successively headquarters of the Prussian kingdom, the second
German Reich, the Weimar Republic and the Nazi regime. It was then
flattened by Allied bombers, occupied by the four victorious powers
and divided into hostile camps, with its eastern sector becoming
the capital of the communist German Democratic Republic. And each
political moment was recorded in its buildings, avenues and empty
spaces. By the time East Germany imploded in November 1989, Berlin
resembled a sprawling museum of architectural history.
</P>
<P>
   It then promptly set out to build yet another ``new Berlin,''
this time as capital of a prosperous, democratic and single
Germany. The problems of turning two cities into one were enormous;
the challenge of starting afresh was exciting. Overnight, Berlin
became a hothouse of discussion about what could or should be done.
Renowned international architects were invited to join the debate.
The past kept blurring visions of the future, but decisions were
finally made. And in the 1990s, more than $120 billion of public
and private money was poured into construction and renovation that
have transformed Berlin's profile.
</P>
<P>
   The Reichstag, Germany's pre-Nazi parliament building, has been
rebuilt; legislators will meet there April 19 for a session marking
the return of the German government to Berlin. Nearby, a modern
Chancellery is going up, while numerous old buildings _ including
some from the Nazi era _ are being prepared to receive government
officials. Private business groups led by Daimler-Benz are close to
completing a new neighborhood at Potsdamer Platz, the heart of
1930s Berlin. The city's prewar historic center between Museum
Island and Pariser Platz is filling up with new buildings. Even the
Stalinist apartment buildings on Karl-Marx-Allee in the former East
Berlin have new facades.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with Berlin about to resume its place at the heart of the
German nation, the new city is ready to be judged. More or less. In
truth, it is not yet complete: cranes still silhouette its skyline,
while the final homes and work places of many officials and
politicians moving here from Bonn won't be ready until 2002. But
more fundamentally, the main urban and architectural decisions
defining the new Berlin have been made.
</P>
<P>
   And the verdict? Well, those hoping for a showcase of
avant-garde architecture have been disappointed. For them, a rare
opportunity has been lost. So far, only Daniel Libeskind's new
Jewish Museum has been hailed as a stunningly original building _
and its design was approved before the Berlin Wall came down. After
reunification in 1990, however, the city's powerful building
authorities opted for what they called the ``critical
reconstruction'' of historic Berlin and imposed strict guidelines
on the size and appearance of all but the federal buildings.
Obsessed with recreating a traditional ``European city,'' they left
little room for innovation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The result is dull and uninspiring,'' said Libeskind, who
still lives in Berlin. ``Now people are beginning to see what was
given to them. Dullness was the bureaucratic result of what the
planners wanted to communicate: power and order, a new `old
Berlin.' But you can't restart history by pressing a button. It
becomes a kitsch idea of history.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet from a strictly urban point of view, great strides have been
made toward reuniting the city. Remnants of the 100-mile-long
Berlin Wall remain as tourist attractions, but the deep wound it
cut through Berlin for 28 years is quickly being healed: in many
areas, it is hard to know where the wall once stood. As important,
the city's urban infrastructure is being renovated. North of the
Reichstag, for instance, the Lehrter railroad station is being
entirely rebuilt, with a vast hole announcing where a new tunnel
will lead trains in and out of the city. Another tunnel for road
traffic will keep many vehicles out of the city center, while
services like water and drainage are being modernized at huge
expense.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the net result has not been to give the city a strong new
visual identity because, perhaps strangely, Berlin has always felt
insecure about itself. It claims to be over 750 years old, but it
was never an important medieval city. It could boast powerful
figures like Frederick the Great in the 18th century and Otto von
Bismarck, the so-called Iron Chancellor, in the late 19th century,
yet when the Prussian and German rulers dreamed of a monumental
city that mirrored their might, they looked elsewhere, notably
Paris, for inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   And when Hitler dreamed of a 1,000-year Reich, he, too, felt
Berlin was somehow inadequate; he wanted it rebuilt on a pharaonic
scale and renamed Germania.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as a divided city, it lived the schizophrenia of
simultaneously symbolizing both capitalist freedom and totalitarian
order.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, as officials struggled to imagine the city's future,
Berlin's perennial identity crisis weighed heavily. And in the end,
they felt it safer to lower their sights, to shuffle through
Berlin's previous identities in search of one that was reassuring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps it was inevitable,'' said Bernard Schneider, an
architect and urban expert. ``In moments of insecurity, you rely on
regressive feelings and ideas. If you wake up after 60 years in a
coma and you're asked to dance a pirouette, you simply can't do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest of Germany _ and perhaps the rest of Europe _ has
always viewed Berlin with suspicion. True, briefly in the 1920s, it
was the decadent fun capital of Europe and a laboratory for the
Modernist architects _ Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Walter Gropius, Le
Corbusier and others _ of the Bauhaus movement.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But in thinking about Berlin of late, most West Germans do not
recall ``Cabaret'' and all that. For them, as much as Hitler or
even communism, the city represents Prussian militarism, Protestant
severity and a shift in Germany's focus from Western Europe to
Central Europe.
</P>
<P>
   This distrust surfaced when the 662-member Bundestag, the German
parliament, voted in 1991 to move the capital from Bonn to Berlin:
the resolution was adopted by a majority of just 17 votes.
</P>
<P>
   The first idea mooted was to build a new government district on
a campuslike site in Berlin. But cost became a factor, and the Bonn
government decided instead to make maximum use of existing
buildings in Berlin, notably two vast ones constructed by the
Nazis: Hitler's Reichsbank, which later served as the headquarters
of the East German Communist Party, will become the Foreign
Ministry; and Goering's Air Force Ministry, called the House of
Ministries under communism, will serve as the new Finance Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   For Berliners, it seemed natural to use these familiar
buildings, which look reassuringly Prussian with their stone
exteriors interrupted by long rows of rectangular windows. But the
Bonn government was always more sensitive to symbolism and, above
all, to a question that would color much of the debate about the
new Berlin: should Germany try to obliterate its past or learn to
live with its own (not always pleasant) history. The Communists had
already stripped these two buildings of all Nazi insignia, but
architects were appointed to try to give them a modern freshness.
In the case of the Foreign Ministry, for example, a new glass annex
is being added.
</P>
<P>
   The debate about the Reichstag proved even more complicated.
Built between 1884 and 1894 in an ornate neo-Baroque style, it
burned down _ supposedly on Nazi orders _ just weeks after Hitler
came to power in 1933. During the Battle of Berlin, it was then
reduced to ruins by Soviet artillery. The Bonn government decided
to restore it in 1961, but almost immediately the Berlin Wall went
up beside its eastern entrance. In the years that followed, the
Reichstag housed a permanent historical exhibition, but it was
never much loved. After reunification, many legislators in Bonn
thought it too small, too ugly and too Prussian to be the new home
of the Bundestag. But the yearning for continuity again won out.
</P>
<P>
   An architectural competition was organized and, in a display of
German self-consciousness about symbols of its power today, three
foreign architects were named the finalists: Norman Foster of
Britain, Santiago Calatrava of Spain and Pi de Bruijn of the
Netherlands. All three were asked to rework their proposals and,
after endless negotiations with Federal officials, Foster's design
was eventually approved. Shortly before construction began, in
1995, the Reichstag's imminent transition was announced magically
when it was wrapped by the artists Christo and Jeanne-Claude.
Today, with its signature glass dome intended to symbolize
democratic transparency (and offer splendid views over the city),
it is recognized as one of the architectural success stories of the
new Berlin. The building itself was gutted and a new brightly
lighted legislative chamber was placed at its heart.
</P>
<P>
   Bonn's debate about Berlin, however, had surprisingly little
echo in the city itself. Here, officials were less concerned with
symbolism than with creating a vibrant new city where Berliners
felt at home. And unknowingly they had prepared for reunification
in the 1980s with an urban construction program somewhat oddly
named the International Building Exhibition. It was born of concern
that West Berlin had turned its back on the wall, that its
commercial and social center was moving steadily west. Berlin
architects led by Josef Paul Kleihues were also alarmed that urban
planners in both West and East Berlin were ``deconstructing'' the
``European city'' by building wide avenues and social housing far
from the workplace. For them, Modernism had gone too far. They
favored what they called ``critical reconstruction'' of Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   The area chosen for the new buildings was to the south of
Checkpoint Charlie, one of the main accesses to East Berlin, where
contemporary architects _ among them, Aldo Rossi and Paolo
Portoghesi of Italy, Richard Rogers and James Stirling of Britain
and Peter Eisenman and Robert Venturi of the United States _ were
invited to recreate the ``European city'': a traditional
neighborhood with street corners and plazas and with privately
owned buildings of a limited height and size that mixed commercial
and residential functions. When the wall came down, then, much of
the theoretical thinking that would define the city's building
policy had been done.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without the International Building Exhibition, the post-wall
era would have been a disaster,'' Kleihues said, adding that he
always favored ``more modesty, more silence'' over monumentalism.
</P>
<P>
   It was not a disaster, but it was not uneventful. Berlin wanted
big-name international architects to work here, and these same
architects wanted to be part of the new Berlin. But the architects
soon learned that Berlin's planners had the last word on what the
buildings would look like. Some foreign architects refused to make
their design fit the guidelines and walked away. Others argued,
complained and made concessions. But most competitions were won by
Berlin architects for the simple reason that they _ and carefully
selected juries _ shared Kleihues' vision. What had begun in the
1980s as an architectural backlash against urban planners became,
in the 1990s, a running battle between traditional and contemporary
architectural esthetics.
</P>
<P>
   The first major project, the reconstruction of Potsdamer Platz,
was already being planned when the wall came down; the land had
been acquired by Daimler-Benz in 1987 as an expression of faith in
Berlin. Then, in 1990, adjacent plots were bought by Sony and the
Asea Brown Boveri group. But when Daimler-Benz turned to design
questions, it ran up against Berlin officials. The officials
accepted the idea of high-rise buildings _ albeit limiting their
height to 260 feet, or about 20 stories _ but they also insisted on
using the area's original street plan and recapturing the spirit of
a European city with mixed commercial, entertainment and
residential spaces.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, after approval of a master plan prepared by Renzo Piano
and Christoph Kohlbecker, construction began in October 1994. Piano
himself designed eight buildings, including a new music
theater-cum-casino and a high-rise building for Daimler-Benz's top
management, while Richard Rogers built other Daimler-Benz offices;
Rafael Moneo of Spain designed the new Hyatt Hotel; Hans Kollhoff
built another high-rise, and Arata Isozaki of Japan built the
Volksbank headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Today, while construction of Helmut Jahn's vast glass and steel
Sony Center advances apace, Potsdamer Platz is virtually completed
_ and it can boast big-name architects as its authors.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the result has not won unanimous approval. From afar, its
high-rises suggest a modern business district, but its narrow
streets are inevitably in shadow, while the attempt to create a
public space out of Marlene Dietrich Platz has so far been less
than successful. Still, the shopping mall is already a draw and,
once the music theater opens in June with Disney's ``Hunchback of
Notre Dame,'' things may become livelier.
</P>
<P>
   But much of the architecture in the district is listless. The
Hyatt Hotel, for instance, consists of stone walls with rows of
identical windows. Rogers' steel and glass buildings on the eastern
edge of the area are more imaginative, but even he was not
satisfied with the results.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within the limitations set, Potsdamer Platz is quite
successful,'' he said, ``but the limitations set were completely
ridiculous. I think Renzo has done brilliantly within a very
dogmatic approach. But why invite people like Renzo Piano and then
tie their hands? The result in Berlin as a whole is that having
employed some of the world's best architects, none of them has done
any of their best work.''
</P>
<P>
   For Pariser Platz and the nearby Friedrichstrasse area, city
officials were even stricter. They ruled that prewar streets and
blocks be restored, that the height of buildings be limited to 72
feet at the street and to 98 feet in total, that exteriors be
covered with stone, that glass not exceed 50 percent of facades and
that 20 percent of space be dedicated to private living space. In
this way, they hoped to recreate the scale, intimacy, density and
life style of their ``European city.'' Needless to say, architects
with an artistic bent were frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much of the center, with its stern rows of windows of the same
rectangular size, is dull and unimaginative,'' said Peter Conradi,
an architect and former politician who now heads the Chamber of
German Architects. ``I would have liked to have seen more
courage.''
</P>
<P>
   The only building on Friedrichstrasse that is different is that
of Galeries Lafayette, designed by Jean Nouvel of France. He got
away with a largely glass exterior simply because Berlin wanted the
prestige store, and Galeries Lafayette insisted on using Nouvel.
But he lamented the city's cautiousness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they went about it as if nothing had happened, as if
they were erasing history between 1933 and 1989,'' he said. ``There
are some important architectural works in the city _ Libeskind's
museum and Piano's high-rise _ but `critical reconstruction'
reflected a desire for continuity, a policy of little risk, nowhere
near as adventurous or prestigious as you might have hoped.''
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of the Brandenberg Gate, Pariser Platz _ the
western end of Unter den Linden, the monumental avenue that cuts
through historic Berlin _ is being completely rebuilt. Two bank
buildings, designed by Kleihues with stone facades and small
windows, now stand on either side of the gate. And its uniformity
is reflected at the entrance to the square by the Hotel Adlon.
Three buildings still to be completed, though, may disrupt the
current sameness. Frank Gehry's design for the Deutsche
Genossenschaftsbank provides for larger windows, although much of
his innovation will be inside the building. Christian de
Portzamparc's new French Embassy, still at the design stage, also
suggests something more modern. After heated negotiations, Guenter
Behnisch's new Academy of Arts building, tucked into a corner of
the plaza, will even have a glass facade.
</P>
<P>
   ``For once we won the battle,'' said Cornelius Hertling, the
president of the Berlin Chamber of Architects, who echoes the
criticism of official policy voiced by many international
architects. ``Pariser Platz was a baroque square with small
independent palaces, so it's all right to keep the size of the
square and the height of the buildings. But why should I be forced
to have Prussian windows? I told Portzamparc not to follow the
Prussian rules _ and he didn't. But the Adlon is retrograde to an
extent that is laughable. Once again, it's the museum approach.''
</P>
<P>
   It is an approach that has enjoyed the support of the Berlin
Senate, but its execution has been largely in the hands of one
immensely powerful city official, Hans Stimmann, who was the city's
building director from 1990 to 1997 and is now its planning
director. The 58-year-old architect-turned-urban planner has in
essence carried out Kleihues' idea of ``critical reconstruction,''
but he has added an inflexibility that even some admirers consider
excessive. And in the process he has become the nemesis of all
architects who hoped for something different.
</P>
<P>
   ``He single-handedly ruined Berlin,'' said Richard Meier, who
saw one of his projects vetoed by Stimmann in the early 1990s. ``He
got terrible, horrible results because he did not understand the
scale. But it was his view that counted. He had total authority.
When I presented my design, he said, `This isn't what we want.' So
I told him, `If you want a 19th-century architect, get a
19th-century architect.'''
</P>
<P>
   Tall, white haired, with a bushy mustache, accustomed to being
attacked by modern architects, Stimmann speaks with the quiet
conviction of a convert.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a 1968 man, interested in social and political problems,
but not in history,'' he explained. ``We associated nostalgia with
conservatives. But step by step my ideas changed. We slowly saw
that old things were not bad. And with the International Building
Exhibition, we accepted history. You know, the Berlin of 1989 was
not the result of bombing, but of politics and bad planning by
people who were against history. For me, 90 percent of old things
are better, so let's stop with experiments.''
</P>
<P>
   By ``experiments'' he meant what he calls architectural
``objects,'' free-standing buildings that may be applauded for
their sculptural value but that in his view have no place in a
traditional city.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Jewish Museum is a typical example of that,'' Stimmann
went on. ``It's a very important building as a museum, but
Libeskind tries to project his ideas for the museum on the whole
city. You can't. It doesn't work. Big architects feel like big
artists. You have to know immediately it's a Jahn building or a
Foster building. Our problem was not to build a picture collection
with a famous Picasso or a famous Jahn. A lot of architects didn't
like my guidelines, but I feel architecture should be part of
society.''
</P>
<P>
   The arguing will certainly go on but, in the battle over the
esthetics of the new Berlin, Stimmann and his backers appear to be
the winners. Now, in his new post as planning director, he is
looking to the bleak and ugly area around Alexanderplatz in former
East Berlin for the next stage of urban development. In the
meantime, though, one pending decision _ to be made jointly by the
federal and Berlin governments _ reminds again how the future keeps
being tripped up by the past.
</P>
<P>
   In 1950, East Germany demolished the vast 18th-century
Hohenzollern Palace at the eastern end of Unter den Linden and
replaced it in 1976 with a smaller _ though still large _ Palace of
the Republic, which housed the rubber-stamp parliament but also
theaters, discotheques, bowling alleys, restaurants and the like.
When the city was reunited, this building was found to be
contaminated with asbestos and was closed. Almost immediately, a
grass-roots movement began campaigning for reconstruction of the
Hohenzollern Palace. But former East Berliners _ Ossies _ were
equally opposed to demolition of the Palace of the Republic, which
represented their few good memories of the Communist regime. And
for the moment, while being slowly stripped of asbestos, the palace
stands sealed and boarded, awaiting its fate.
</P>
<P>
   For a good many Berliners, it seems, sorting out the past is
still more important than stepping into the future.

BUILDING A CAPITAL WHERE TRIUMPH IS TABOO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, April 11)  
 (also see BERLIN-WALKING, BERLIN-IDENTITY, BERLIN-CULTURE,
BERLIN-SUBCULTURE, BERLIN-ARCHITECTURE and BERLIN-VOICES)

 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ The early 19th century French writer Stendhal once
remarked of Berlin that he had no idea ``who thought of planting a
town in the middle of this sand.''
</P>
<P>
   Out of the damp sand, not far from the Reichstag, beneath the
countless cranes that are the sentinels of this city's shifting
heart, a hole has been dug. It is huge even by the standards of
this home of excavational excess; it will, so the planners say, one
day house Berlin's new central railway station, a hub of
north-south and east-west lines worthy of a European capital
reborn.
</P>
<P>
   North-south lines of any kind have been something of a taboo
here even since the Bundestag voted by a narrow margin in 1991 to
return the German capital to Berlin. The reason is that it was
along a majestic north-south axis that Hitler's architect, Albert
Speer, planned the Via Triumphalis of the Thousand Year Reich, an
avenue that was to lead to a victory arch twice the size of the Arc
de Triomphe.
</P>
<P>
   So it is perhaps not surprising that the north-south line
running through that hole will be underground. But however the city
masks its ambitions, the notion of standing at the center, of being
a ``Weltstadt'' _ a world city _ midway between Stockholm and
Venice, Paris and Moscow, is very much of Berlin: an extravagant
idea regularly summoned from the boggy plains of Prussia to provide
a beacon in an often featureless sea of provincialism.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that Stendhal's dismay is understandable even
today. From the Hohenzollerns to Hitler, ideas for a great German
city have abounded; but Brl, the Slavic word at the root of
Berlin's name, means marsh, and the lofty has tended to sag or sink
here with an eerie repetitiveness. Now, once again, Berlin has set
out to attain its long-held dream of being a European cultural
capital and, by so doing, unite Germans and overcome the past.
</P>
<P>
   The road will be a long one. Berlin's tortured history at the
nexus of 20th-century conflict has left it oddly isolated. Beyond
the city's limits, the lake-littered flatlands stretch away,
scarred still with the tracks left by Soviet tanks exercising for
the great Cold War battle that never came. Within the city's vast
sprawl, something often seems to be missing, leaving the impression
of an urban area out of proportion to its content.
</P>
<P>
   Human density, the whiff and fever of money being made, high
society, city chic, the avant-garde excitement of a Bertolt Brecht,
the sensuous intrigue of metropolitan life _ much of this seems to
have been drained from Berlin by its long postwar incarnation as an
island in a Red sea, communist in the East, subsidized in the West,
almost entirely alien to the cut-and-thrust of private initiative.
</P>
<P>
   The struggle to reinvigorate the place, give it coherence, make
it whole, remains arduous even a decade after the fall of the Wall.
Parts of the former East, particularly Prenzlauer Berg and Mitte,
are now full of trendy cafes; the club scene is lively enough; new
art galleries are opening. But Berlin, observed Bernhard Schlink, a
novelist, ``still lacks a physical or psychological center.''
</P>
<P>
   Axel Schultes, one of the architects of the new Berlin
Chancellery that Gerhard Schroeder, a Social Democrat, will occupy
later this year, is frustrated by this enduring fragmentation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is that Germany lost courage, identity and culture
because of the loss of our cities in World War II,'' he said.
``Look at Dresden, look at Berlin, and you see a facade of history,
empty behind its surface. I think a great deal of the German
anxiety comes from losing that urban fabric. And I am desperately
unhappy that it has proved so difficult to restore a palpable
texture of metropolitan life to this grayish, kaput city. Because
if we can ever regain German identity, it is here in Berlin.''
</P>
<P>
   A lot is indeed at stake in the return of the German capital to
Berlin 54 years after the fall of the Reich. Bonn, the small
Rhineland town hastily chosen as capital of the post-war German
Federal Republic in 1949, was a means to overcome the past by
avoiding it, ``a beginning, a city without a past,'' as Konrad
Adenauer put it. The town, placid and twee, betokened a muted
identity about as distant from Prussian militarism as could be
imagined. The aim, above all, was to be unthreatening.
</P>
<P>
   Berlin, by contrast, involves a more complete, and critical,
German emancipation through direct confrontation with that past;
the Foreign Ministry, for example, is moving into Hitler's former
Reichsbank and the Labor Ministry into Joseph Goebbels' Propaganda
Ministry. In this tense dialectic _ between Nazi ghosts and
ambitious metropolitan dreams, between Cold War shadows and visions
of a Germany where old East-West tensions have gone _ lies the
potential and the danger of Berlin. As a backdrop for cultural
experiment, it is unusually rich.
</P>
<P>
   It is also uncertain. The risks are evident. This is the fifth
Germany of which Berlin has been capital in the last century: the
others were Imperial, Weimar, Nazi and Communist. A restlessness
redolent of the New World has characterized the city's apparently
insatiable appetite to reinvent itself. It is interesting, and
disturbing to some, that Germany is back at war, this time at
America's side and in Kosovo, just as the move to Berlin takes
place. Certainly, this is not the act of a political midget.
</P>
<P>
   Can the city be an unthreatening expression of this new German
desire to emerge from political tutelage and find the stability
that has long eluded it? On Berlin's success depends a
``normalization'' now craved by the vast majority of Germans. This
normality is not synonymous with conformity. In fact, the often
stifling conformity of the immediate postwar generation is now
rejected by many young Germans.
</P>
<P>
   These Germans do not shun the duty of memory. But they feel
there must be a life beyond inherited guilt and shame. For many of
them, the normality of a successful ``Berlin Republic'' should be
bold where Bonn was banal, weaving together political, cultural and
intellectual threads to form a vibrant city of a revived
Mitteleuropa.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``What will distinguish Berlin from Paris or London is the fact
that it is the true meeting point of East and West, the one place
where the two mentalities are present day after day,'' said Ulrich
Eckhardt, the director of a millennium cultural festival that will
open in May. ``Berlin's future involves the return of Mitteleuropa.
If the city is to thrive, it must prove a cultural and intellectual
magnet to people from Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and
elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if two main elements of the culture of Mitteleuropa
were Germanic and Slavic, a third was Jewish. Although the Jewish
population of Berlin has grown in recent years to about 10,000,
swollen by arrivals from Russia, Hitler's work is irreversible.
Something was lost; it will not return. That loss still haunts
Berlin, and the city remains at a loss as to how to record it.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most conspicuous, and embarrassing, empty spaces of
the many in this city is a 4.9-acre site beside the Brandenburg
Gate where a Holocaust Memorial has been mooted for a decade now
without agreement being reached on what, if anything, should be
built. Michael Naumann, the top cultural official in Schroeder's
government, has spent much of his time over the last six months
trying to resolve the issue. A vociferous critic last year of plans
for a field of about 2,800 stone pillars by New York architect
Peter Eisenman and New York sculptor Richard Serra. Naumann has
since become a champion of a modified project elaborated with
Eisenman.
</P>
<P>
   ``My original esthetic and moral hesitations remain,'' Naumann
said. ``In the country where the crimes were committed, it seems to
me that any artistic expression, any iconographic gesture, cannot
adequately carry the burden of remembrance. We are known as the
nation of the perpetrators, although most of the perpetrators are
dead, and so what we do will always be questioned by others.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he has become convinced since the Schroeder
government took office of the need for a memorial that would serve
a historical and educational function. ``I did not want to be
co-opted by the conservatives, and I had underestimated the
memorial's importance to the German state,'' Naumann said. The
revised plan, on which the Bundestag will vote in May, calls for a
field with a smaller number of pillars, an exhibition space, a vast
archive that will serve as a research center for scholars and a
65-foot high wall of books.
</P>
<P>
   Already, there have been objections from Berlin Mayor Eberhard
Diepgen and from the likely next president of Germany, Johannes
Rau. The discussions could even continue for another decade. But
Naumann said the chancellor was determined to push through the
latest project. Construction would begin next year.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens, the polemics say much about the tensions still
afflicting Berlin. To be bold, culturally or architecturally,
requires a certain confidence, one that Germany and its capital
still lack. The subliminal questions persist: Can we ever be
trusted again? Will others trust us?
</P>
<P>
   Not for nothing, it seems, many of the major urban projects in
the city went to foreign architects. ``The idea was lurking
somewhere that if these foreigners built something too big or
imperial, it was not our fault,'' Schlink suggested.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the results seem mixed. The Potsdamer Platz, the
heart of prewar Berlin and then a no man's land between East and
West, has emerged as a strange hodgepodge, where some fine
buildings, like Renzo Piano's Daimler-Benz complex, appear drowned
in a sea of anonymous commercialism: McDonald's, a vast shopping
mall, movie houses and a dislocated central plaza lacking in
grandeur. But the development has proved hugely popular, one of the
few places where ``Ossis'' and ``Wessis'' really mingle, and
perhaps the lowest common denominator of today's Berliners is
indeed a taste for global brands and the trappings of America.
</P>
<P>
   That, at least, is the view of Christoph Schlingensief, one of
the most provocative young theater directors in Berlin, whose revue
``Die Berliner Republik'' is now showing at the Berlin Volksbuehne.
Largely improvised, the revue suggests a time of terrible
fin-de-siecle desperation, as a lascivious caricature of Schroeder
takes a moment off from groping every woman he can find to bang
helplessly on the glass wall of an elevator and denounce his lonely
fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Globalism is like a mirage in the desert _ you touch it and it
is gone,'' Schlingensief said. ``It suits many Germans because it
is a way out of national identity _ just look at Schroeder's
emotionless end-of-time smile. We are still very afraid of real
emotion; only the illusion of emotion is all right. Our whole
culture has no obsessions. Obsession is a fire you cannot put out.
That is the problem here in Berlin. I see nothing marked by
obsession.''
</P>
<P>
   But of course as this city has repeatedly illustrated, obsession
can be dangerous. So, for the moment, Berlin makes its way
cautiously, a touch dutifully, with its three opera houses _ the
Deutsche Oper, the Staatsoper and the Komische Oper _ side by side
with streets that speak of an incorrigible provincialism. The new
``capital of Europe'' still has no direct flights to the United
States and little prospect of any in the near future. ``Berliners
do not want urbanity,'' Schultes, the architect, said in despair.
``They want trees.''
</P>
<P>
   They have plenty of them, for various reasons, among them the
fact that Berlin has swallowed a series of villages without ever
entirely integrating them. At the turn of the century, the writer
Arthur Eloesser remarked that, ``The extremities of the city have
become so monstrously swollen the insides are suffering from a
shortage of blood.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, of course, Berlin found much blood, but of the wrong
kind, and today it still lacks what Schultes called ``the muscles
that bind.'' Out of such a binding, one senses, a great city of
culture could emerge, but a decade or two will surely be needed.
Meanwhile, the Berlin experiment remains intriguing in its
uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we at ease with each other here?'' Naumann asked. ``No,
not really. It will take decades, even centuries. But perhaps that
is a wonderful state to be in. For it keeps you perpetually on your
toes.''

 By PETER H. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ He did his best to remain anonymous, but within
days after an expert programmer released the Melissa computer virus
into the world late last month, police reported that his identity
had been cracked. Investigators used a tracking mechanism that
Microsoft Corp. had secretly installed in its Office software to
gather information on its customers surreptitiously.
</P>
<P>
   In Yugoslavia, meanwhile, messages poured onto the Internet from
the war zone, providing what appeared to be firsthand accounts of
Yugoslav atrocities against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. Privacy
advocates realized that if the Yugoslav authorities were able to
trace the identities of the writers, many lives could be lost.
Ominously, messages from some writers had stopped suddenly.
</P>
<P>
   The privacy groups moved swiftly to provide the writers with
special access to Anonymizer.com, an Internet service that allows
users to be anonymous and untraceable online, and with information
about PGP, a data encryption program so strong that the United
States prohibits its export.
</P>
<P>
   These two cases, worlds apart, underscore a growing dilemma that
now confronts the electronic world. ``Anonymity has incontestable
value in a huge number of situations, and it is constitutionally
protected,'' said Philip Reitinger, a prosecutor for the Justice
Department, speaking at a ``Computers, Freedom and Privacy''
conference here Wednesday. Moments later, during a panel
discussion, he added, ``If you're serious about prosecuting crime
on the global communications infrastructure, you have to have
traceability.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should communications on the Internet be traceable in some
circumstances? And if so, what should the rules be?''
</P>
<P>
   The issue is a broad one because anonymity is not of interest
only to criminals and dissidents, and not available only to the
technically astute. New technologies are emerging that enable even
casual Internet users to be anonymous online for the first time. At
the same time, new technologies are being deployed to gather ever
more personal information from users.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, debate has emerged over new technologies that
have been deployed to allow companies to track individual users on
the Internet. Intel Corp. embedded a unique identification number
in its Pentium III processor that would enable network operators to
identify individual computers on the Internet, and Microsoft Corp.
designed a ``globally unique identifier'' that secretly appears in
Microsoft Office documents and can be used to trace files back to a
specific person. The Microsoft Office identification number was
used in the Melissa investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Some privacy tools are being simplified and made available
commercially to a broad audience, allowing anyone to browse the
World Wide Web and use e-mail without being identified. The
technologies are morally neutral. They could be used, for example,
to commit a crime or to report one anonymously. The tools, like the
Anonymizer (www.anonymizer.com), are also useful simply for
browsing the Web without having to give up personal information to
marketers, for visiting sex-related Web sites without potential
embarrassment, posting messages on newsgroups using pseudonyms and
for avoiding spam, the bulk-mail advertising pitches that
advertisers send incessantly to e-mail addresses they have culled
from the Net.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet has shifted the balance away from privacy, and
these are attempts to bring it back,'' said David Banisar, an
officer of the Electronic Privacy Information Center
(www.epic.org).
</P>
<P>
   There are other anonymity systems in the works. At AT&AMP;T
Labs-Research in New Jersey, a system called Crowds is being tested
that operates on the premise, familiar to any New Yorker, that one
can be anonymous in a crowd. In the Crowds system, large groups of
geographically dispersed Internet users would be able to band
together and their individual Web page requests would be randomly
forwarded through a shared computer called a proxy server. The
operator of the Web site would not know which member of the crowd
submitted the request, and neither would anyone else in the crowd.
More information is available at www.research.att
.com/projects/crowds.
</P>
<P>
   At Lucent Corp.'s Bell Labs, another anonymity system called the
Lucent Personalized Web Assistant allows a Web user to create a
pseudonym for each Web site; the same pseudonym would be used on
each visit. The Web site operator would not know the visitor's true
identity but could still build a profile of the user's preferences
that could be used to tailor advertisements and content to the
customer on subsequent visits. More information about Lucent's
system is available at www.bell-labs.com/project/lpwa.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another anonymity system under development, this one at the
government's Naval Research Laboratory, is Onion Routing. An Onion
Router (www.onion-router.net) hides not only the content of
messages, but also the very fact that two people are communicating
over a public network.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more intriguing anonymity services under development
is Freedom, a Windows program developed by a Canadian company, Zero
Knowledge Systems (www.zeroknowledge.com). Freedom, which is
expected to be available for public testing next month, is similar
to the Lucent system in that it enables users to establish
pseudonyms that are consistent over time. That would allow a user
to participate freely in a discussion group without worrying about
being identified.
</P>
<P>
   Freedom is expected to cost $50 a year for five separate digital
pseudonyms (extra identities are $10 a year). These online personas
cannot be traced to reveal the user's identity.
</P>
<P>
   The technical details of the system, including strong data
encryption, masked Internet addresses and proxy servers, are hidden
behind a simple user interface, which I've tried in early form.
After a user chooses a persona by clicking on it, all identifying
information is stripped from the original request and replaced by
the information created for the pseudonym.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Millions of Internet users already employ pseudonyms; America
Online, for example, calls them screen names and allows each
subscriber to have several. But in most cases a pseudonym can be
traced to its real owner, often when the Internet company is
compelled by a court order to divulge the information or is tricked
into doing so.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the giant defense contractor Raytheon Corp. sued
more than 20 employees earlier this year for posting pseudonymous
messages about the company on the Internet. At least two employees
resigned after Yahoo, in response to a court subpoena, revealed the
true identities behind the postings. Raytheon asserts that the
messages, which contained gossip and criticisms of the company,
divulged proprietary and confidential information.
</P>
<P>
   With Freedom, not even Zero Knowledge Systems can link the
pseudonyms to a user's real identity. The company knows only that
the person has a Freedom account.
</P>
<P>
   The oldest commercial service offering anonymity, and the only
one currently available to users of any Internet-connected
computer, is Anonymizer.com. Unlike Freedom, Anonymizer does not
require the user to download or install any special software. For a
fee of $5 a month, users can process Web browsing requests and send
messages through Anonymizer's proxy servers. (There is also an
unlimited free browsing service, but Anonymizer inserts a delay,
typically 10 seconds, on page views in the free service. The paid
service has no delays.) For an extra fee, Anonymizer will also
allow users to receive e-mail responses and set up Web pages.
</P>
<P>
   In either case, the user types the address of the Web site to be
visited, and the request is sent to Anonymizer's proxy computer.
The proxy strips off the customer's identifying information and
forwards the request to the Web site, which knows only that the
request is coming from Anonymizer. The page or graphics file is
then returned to the user's computer, and the site can be
bookmarked for return visits with the anonymity intact.
</P>
<P>
   If a company is tracking Web usage by its employees _ which the
courts have ruled is legally permissible, along with reading
employees' e-mail and listening to their phone calls _ it will see
only that the user is connected to Anonymizer.com, but it will not
be able to find out what sites are being visited. For that reason,
a number of companies prohibit employee access to the Anonymizer
site. Other companies use Anonymizer regularly to visit the Web
sites of competitors and gather information, and law enforcement
agencies use it routinely to check up on people under
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the line, some commercial sites do not allow
connections from Anonymizer, either because they require visitors
to provide personal information before granting them access or
because they have had bad experiences with Anonymizer users who
abused the system with bogus credit card scams or harassing
messages. Anonymizer was forced to block its users' access to the
White House Web site because customers were sending threats to the
president.
</P>
<P>
   Anonymizer boots out customers who try to use the system to send
batches of spam, or in response to complaints from people being
harassed through the site.
</P>
<P>
   As with all of the anonymous services now being developed for
the Internet, the good has to be balanced with the bad. ``The real
world is routinely anonymous,'' said Lance Cottrell, Anonymizer's
chief executive. ``When you drive down the street, typically there
is no one photographing your license plate, no one keeping track of
where you park and how long you stay. What's unusual about the
Internet is that everything is by default logged and tracked.
What's aberrant is not the presence of anonymity on the Internet,
but that you have to take special steps to achieve it.''

TEXAS HEALTH CHIEF COURTS A NEW AGE &HT;   
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    By POLLY ROSS HUGHES 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The Texas Department of Health, state lawmakers
decided, has been looking for love in all the wrong places.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the House Appropriations Committee needled Health
Commissioner William ``Reyn'' Archer III at his agency's recent
biennial funding review about questionable state spending on a
photo lab and an expensive junket to China. Yet what most riveted
their attention was a March posting for two $76,000 positions they
quickly dubbed ``Dr. Love'' and ``Commissioner of Love.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Qualifications: ``Knowledge or the ability to comprehend and
articulate the conflicting dynamics of love and alienation as root
causes of social dysfunction and marginal health status. Knowledge
of community ethos relating to dysfunctions and spirituality of
human nature.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't know where we're going on this,'' Rep. Leticia
Van de Putte, D-San Antonio, told Archer. ``I mean, is the Dalai
Lama going to apply for the job?''
</P>
<P>
   The job descriptions for the two associate commissioners alarmed
the elected officials who said they worried about what their
constituents might think. Archer, they noted, had earlier laid
plans to shift money away from underfunded basic health services _
such as school-based clinics _ and into an untested theory to
attack root causes of ``diseases of choice, of lifestyle.''
</P>
<P>
   For Archer, the son of a powerful congressman, the showdown
proved a firsthand lesson in politics. Considered an intelligent
man of lofty ideals, the commissioner's latest vision proved too
transcendental for the Texas Legislature to comprehend. In a
stinging rebuke, the committee passed measures calling for the
start-up of four school health clinics and another restricting
Archer's ability to shift money around in his own department.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm at risk of being misunderstood, in a sense, no matter what
I say, but the fact is the goal here is to really make a difference
in Texas public health. Obviously, people can misperceive our
intentions,'' Archer told the committee.
</P>
<P>
   The health commissioner said he thinks his interest in
mind-body-spirit connections is mainstream, but several legislators
pointed out that attacking ``root causes'' of behavior takes the
idea into a new and nebulous dimension.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Archer is asking the Legislature for a $150 million
endowment from the state's tobacco settlement. Anticipated interest
of $8.4 million a year could finance a research foundation for the
next decade to prove why cultural and spiritual issues of
alienation cause certain groups to smoke, engage in risky sex, take
dangerous drugs, eschew exercise, drink excessively and eat too
much.
</P>
<P>
   Archer's interest is in ``population-based'' health initiatives
aimed at communities with such common traits as their cultural
heritage, race, and, in the case of adolescents or obese children,
their youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Archer has articulated a belief that modern public health
problems arise from disordered interpersonal relations. They are
exacerbated by a reduction in societal cohesion and a rise in
alienation, especially among young people,'' according to the
department's four-page proposal calling for the creation of the
Texas Foundation for Public Health Research.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal also says minorities and new immigrants ``continue
to bear the greater burden of certain diseases'' and ``today Texans
suffer largely from diseases of choice, of lifestyle. Roughly
speaking, a Texan can choose whether or not to place himself at
risk for these diseases.''
</P>
<P>
   Days after his legislative encounter, the commissioner sat in
his office at the health department and wondered if his idea is
perhaps ahead of its time. Clearly the choice of words in the job
description meant too many things to too many people, said Archer,
an obstetrician-gynecologist and son of U.S. Rep. Bill Archer,
R-Houston.
</P>
<P>
   To some, maybe it looked like an issue of separation of church
and state. He said he draws a distinction between spirituality and
religion that others might not understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We obviously need to be careful about being perceived as a
proselytizing agency because that cannot be our goal. We can't work
with a diverse population if we come at it from one vantage point
that you're going to believe the way we believe,'' he said. ``It
won't work.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he can't predict whether the Legislature will create the
$150 million endowment from the tobacco settlement that could be
put toward the preventive strategies he wants to try. House Bill
1676 by Rob Junell, D-San Angelo, he noted, includes language for
setting up an endowment for children's health care and grants to
local communities.
</P>
<P>
   Since the language is ``loose enough but not prescriptive,'' it
could open the door for the foundation, which would oversee grants
to local organizations and universities interested in studying and
proposing ways to strike at root causes of risky behaviors.
</P>
<P>
   ``People need to know that there's nothing radical,'' he said.
``They need to know these will help communities, not hurt them.
They don't know that yet, but we have an obligation to show that.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   At the appropriations committee earlier, Rep. Dianne Delisi, a
Temple Republican, spoke up for Archer's philosophy of public
health. She said she believes his approach could prolong life in
the next century the way polio vaccines did in this one.
</P>
<P>
   Archer then defended his concept of ``pre-primary'' preventive
medicine, saying it could help identify why Houston has the lowest
inoculation rates of any major city in the country. Is there an
identifiable cultural underpinning at work that could be addressed?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fascinating discussion, because every time I want to
talk about love and alienation, everybody wants to talk about
polio,'' said Rep. Kyle Janek, a medical doctor and Houston
Republican. ``Dr. Archer, if I can keep you on point here, I'd like
you to tell me what the lack of immunization has to do with love
and alienation.''
</P>
<P>
   Janek also asked why, when law enforcement officials have
understood the root causes of juvenile gangs for decades, no one
has figured out what to do to stop them. His scrutiny proved so
unrelenting that Archer finally gave up: ``Obviously, I'm not able
to justify it.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he quickly noted that he probably could have avoided
such pointed questions if he had simply changed the language of the
job descriptions. More than 90 people applied for each job, the
health department said, but no one has been hired for either yet.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Laredo, noted later that Archer is a
``very nice man, very pleasant man,'' who nonetheless struck a
nerve with lawmakers who didn't want basic health services cut in
their communities to make room for a concept they found
ill-defined.
</P>
<P>
   What, exactly would the $76,000-a-year people do all day, asked
Janek, who later said he found Archer's responses unsatisfactory.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say we're going to shift money away from poor people to
this global Big Brother concept is bad policy, as far as I'm
concerned. Bizarre might not be too strong a word,'' Janek said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This sounds incendiary,'' said Rep. Garnet Coleman, D-Houston,
``but what is the real agenda at this health department? He's
clashing with us in a sense that we want to provide direct services
to our constituents and we want a concrete explanation of the value
of this research he's talking about, the value of these
population-based programs that we can't get a handle on.''
</P>
<P>
   Coleman said he senses Archer has been pursuing a
``sociopolitical agenda'' at the health department. ``I believe he
has an ideology, and yes, I think he is moving forward with that
ideology. What that ideology is I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner, whose appointment two years ago was approved
by Gov. George W. Bush, was among organizers for Bush's conference
last week on ``right choices'' for youth aimed at educators,
doctors, law enforcement officials and others interested in guiding
the values of children.
</P>
<P>
   Janek, however, emphasized to Archer that it is difficult to
justify spending public money for ``love and alienation'' when the
state is already taking heat for alarming child abuse deaths and
too few child protection caseworkers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you see why we think that makes us look bad?'' he asked
Archer. ``(It) reinforces the negative perceptions people have
about government.''
</P>
<P>
   But Archer contends that mainstream medicine is showing a
growing interest in the mind-body-spirit connection. He cited
studies, including one conducted by the University of Texas M.D.
Anderson Cancer Center, that show higher healing rates for patients
with spiritual grounding.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been studies, for example, in universities where
individuals going through heart surgery who have connectedness and
have a faith in God have a significantly greater chance of survival
than those who do not. It can't be about promoting religion, but it
does need to be that we are open to the dynamics that lead to good
health,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But such thinking is relatively new for Western medicine, Janek
said, and has not been subjected to rigorous scientific research.
For the state of Texas to go forward with the idea, he said, would
make the state look foolish and reflect badly on the health
department.
</P>
<P>
   The department of health should gather data and identify public
health concerns wherever they pop up, Janek said, but the
government must always avoid temptations to intrude into the lives
of its citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as policy, twisting arms, encouraging people to be
healthy and sanctioning if they do not, that is not something I
want the department of health to do,'' he said. ``When (and if)
they want to start interfering and taking someone's personal
freedoms away, I draw the line.''

NEW BALLET STAR STEPS INTO THE SPOTLIGHT
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Don't expect the traditional wizened,
wizardly Dr. Coppelius when the Fort Worth Dallas Ballet dances the
humorous story ballet ``Coppelia'' at Bass Performance Hall this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   For this production, the magician who throws a village into
comical turmoil when he creates a life-size, lifelike doll will be
a younger, more active fellow, reinterpreted to fit the unique
combination of acting and dancing skills that Igor Dombrovsky
brings to the role.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, I thought of Coppelius as an old guy,'' Dombrovsky
says. ``Now, he's younger. He lives in his own world. He's slightly
kookier than the usual Coppelius.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the first starring role for Dombrovsky, 33, who is
finishing his second year with the company. His move into the
spotlight and his reinterpretation of Coppelius are symbolic of the
transformation the ballet has experienced this year. New dancers
are moving forward and new ideas are moving in, just as surely as a
younger version of Coppelius supplants the traditional.
</P>
<P>
   Dancers such as Maria Terezia Balogh, Todd Edson and Maria
Thomas, who for a decade defined the look of the company, are gone
or leaving. Dombrovsky and a host of other dancers are molding a
company in keeping with the vision of new artistic director
Benjamin Houk.
</P>
<P>
   Audiences at Fort Worth Dallas Ballet, long accustomed to the
Balanchine repertoire, have seen a definite break toward greater
diversity this season. This revival of the 19th-century, classical
story ballet ``Coppelia'' represents another major new ingredient
in the repertoire.
</P>
<P>
   Artistic director Houk, completing his first season at the helm
of the company, spotted Dombrovsky's ability to introduce character
development and acting into his dancing, even as a background
figure in ``Rodeo'' and ``The Nutcracker.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Kiev, Dombrovsky focused on the accordion as a
youngster. He planned on becoming a concert accordionist, a career
of the sort that could only exist in the old Soviet Union. But his
mother and father (a kindergarten teacher and sewing-machine
mechanic, respectively) were unhappy in the Soviet Union and gained
permission to emigrate to the United States when Igor was 15.
</P>
<P>
   One of the things young Igor brought with him from Kiev was a
taste for ballet, even though he had no training. Although he had
seen ballet mostly on television, he remembers seeing live
performances of ``Swan Lake'' and ``Don Quixote.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so stricken by the beauty of them that I was almost
sick,'' he recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than moving to one of the major Russian communities then
sprouting up across America, where one could live surrounded by
transplanted Russian culture, the Dombrovsky family moved to San
Antonio and began assimilating.
</P>
<P>
   After high school, Dombrovsky joined the ``Up With People''
touring musical group and began learning basic theatrical dancing.
After a year on the road, he entered college at United States
International University in San Diego, focusing first on theater
and then on musical theater, and studying ballet, tap and jazz
dancing. His first appearance in ballet was as a stepsister in
``Cinderella.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a turning point in my life,'' he says. ``I decided to
devote myself to ballet.''
</P>
<P>
   Although for many years Dombrovsky tried to avoid being labeled
as a ``character dancer'' _ a dancer who specializes in roles that
sometimes take more acting than dancing, such as the stepsisters in
``Cinderella'' or Drosselmeyer in ``Nutcracker'' _ it's not
surprising, given his background, that that's where he has landed
in the prime of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a long time, I was afraid of being called a character
dancer,'' he admits. ``I didn't want to be cast only in certain
roles. Character dancers typically aren't as concerned with clean
lines as other dancers. They are more concerned with catching the
eye of the audience.''
</P>
<P>
   But, according to Houk, Dombrovsky brings both dancing and
acting to the role to an unusual degree.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not as crotchety as the usual Dr. Coppelius,'' Houk says.
``Since he's such a capable dancer and actor, he does a lot more
than Coppelius often does.''

   ANTIBIOTICS FOR THE HEART
</P>
<P>
   Antibiotics may prove as valuable in the treatment of heart
disease as they are against ulcers, which only in recent years have
been associated with bacterial infections, according to reports in
last week's issue of ``Circulation: Journal of the American Heart
Association.''
</P>
<P>
   Antibiotic treatment reduces inflammation in the blood vessels,
which plays a much larger role in coronary heart disease than was
once thought, says Dr. Jeffrey Anderson, chief of cardiology at the
University of Utah Medical Center and a principal investigator in
the study.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now know that such factors as high cholesterol, cigarette
smoking, high blood pressure and diabetes can cause inflammation in
the blood vessels, which contributes to atherosclerosis, the cause
of heart attacks,'' Anderson says. ``If common infectious agents
such as chlamydia `rev up' the atherosclerotic inflammatory
process, antibiotic therapy could become a major breakthrough
treatment against a disease that kills more Americans each year
than any other disease.''
</P>
<P>
   More study is needed to determine the role of antibiotics in
preventing heart attacks, doctors say.
</P>
<P>
   BEST MEDICINE
</P>
<P>
   The recent film ``Patch Adams'' has renewed interest in the
effectiveness of using laughter as medical therapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``A growing number of health professionals recognize the value
of humor and are using it with patients to help relieve anxiety and
promote recovery,'' says Dr. Ron Berk, reporting in the ``Johns
Hopkins Health Insiders'' newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Laughter can help decrease anxiety and stress and improve the
perceived quality of life, important factors during times of
illness,'' Berk ways. ``Studies show that laughter may also trigger
physiological changes such as stimulating circulation, improving
respiration, boosting production of pain-reducing endorphins and
possibly even increasing immune system activity and response.''
</P>
<P>
   STRESS 'N' SNIFFLES
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have identified what may be the biological link
between stress and the common cold: interleukin-6 (IL-6), a
chemical pathway used by the immune system.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Sheldon Cohen of Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh,
who earlier found a clear link between psychological stress and
infection by respiratory viruses, says the new study provides
concrete evidence of a mind-body connection _ the biological
pathway through which psychological stress influences
upper-respiratory infectious illness.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen and his colleagues had previously established stress as a
risk factor for respiratory illness but had only been able to
speculate on the potential biological pathway that links stress to
greater risks of colds and flu.

<P>
   The 1910s began with a roar and ended with a whimper _ a
tempestuous decade of high living, high prices, the introduction of
income taxes, women's suffrage, World War I, an influenza pandemic
that killed between 20 million and 50 million people, and _ as if
to put a lid on this Pandora's box _ the proclamation of
Prohibition.
</P>
<P>
   America's economy was chugging along, having evolved from
agrarian to industrial. Immigration was at full throttle. The
number of house servants, who often came from the newly arrived
masses, continued to decline as immigrants found jobs in factories
and mines.
</P>
<P>
   Through the end of the decade, the number of domestic servants
dropped from 1.8 million to 1.4 million while the number of
households rose from 20.3 million to 24.4 million. This meant that
homemakers, once the managing directors of housework, became
responsible for the hands-on duty. But industry was there to offer
a helping hand. This was the decade that saw the first big
introduction of household appliances.
</P>
<P>
   But all was not progress. A depression in 1914-15 led the
nutrition reformers, the eat-by-the-numbers zealots of the previous
decade, to poke their noses into the eating habits of immigrants
and the poor. Concern was valid, as many immigrants lived in
cramped quarters in large Eastern cities where disease was rampant.
But food was one area where a little knowledge could be a dangerous
thing.
</P>
<P>
   One system of judging malnutrition, the Dumferline Scale, ranked
height, weight, eyesight, breathing, muscularity, mental alertness
and rosiness of complexion as benchmarks of health. This worked
fine for British and German children but was inappropriate for
olive-skinned Italians, Greeks, Turks and Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Convinced of widespread malnutrition, the school lunch program
ballooned, but the American food ideal wasn't necessarily that of
the immigrant.
</P>
<P>
   Italian immigrant John Fante recognized the two worlds of his
food.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the lunch hour I huddle over my lunch pail, for my mother
doesn't wrap my sandwiches in wax paper and she makes them too
large and the lettuce leaves protrude. Worse, the bread is
homemade; not bakery bread, not `American' bread. I make a great
fuss because I can't have mayonnaise and other `American' things,''
Fante recalled in ``American Mercury'' magazine in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   And Fante's family no doubt drank wine with its meals _ unlike
nonimmigrant families. But that, too, was about to change.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan, a Prohibitionist,
served Welch's grape juice instead of wine at a 1913 dinner for the
British ambassador. The next year, Secretary of the Navy Josephus
Daniels ordered that the Navy's traditional rum grog be replaced
with Welch's grape juice.
</P>
<P>
   By 1919, the Temperance League had won out and the sale and
distribution of alcohol was banned. In 1920, saloons were shuttered
and distilleries closed, and America would begin its Noble
Experiment.
</P>
<P>
   1910: Seventy percent of U.S. bread is baked at home, down from
80 percent in 1890. Processors employ more than 68,000 people to
can 3 billion cans of food in factories per year.
</P>
<P>
   1910: The first refrigerated tank car for wine brings California
wine to the East, but most Golden State wine is shipped by steamer
around Cape Horn in oak barrels.
</P>
<P>
   1911: The first canned chili and tamales are produced in San
Antonio by William Gebhardt. The term ``tamale pie'' first appears
in print.
</P>
<P>
   1911: Procter &AMP; Gamble introduces Crisco, the first solid
vegetable shortening. The product is a hard sell to women who had
been taught to cook with butter and lard. To promote its product,
the manufacturer suggests glazing sweet potatoes with brown sugar
and Crisco, and spreading sandwiches with Crisco mixed with an egg
yolk, Worcestershire sauce, lemon juice and vinegar. Orthodox Jews,
however, love the shortening because it is neither meat nor dairy,
so it can be used at any kosher meal. Crisco has better luck late
in the decade, when lard and butter become scarce because of the
war effort.
</P>
<P>
   1912: Ohio chocolate manufacturer Clarence Crane develops
LifeSavers as a ``summer candy'' that can withstand heat better
than chocolate. The next year, he sells the rights to the
peppermint candy to Edward Noble for $2,900. Noble develops
tin-foil wrappers to keep the mints fresh (they had been packaged
in cardboard rolls).
</P>
<P>
   1912: Nabisco introduces Oreo Biscuits to compete with the
Hydrox ``biscuit bonbons'' rolled out in 1910.
</P>
<P>
   1912: Immigrants pour into the country. Between 1910-1924, 12
million come through Ellis Island. All are examined for health
problems; 2 percent are sent back across the Atlantic. Meanwhile, 1
million emigrate from Mexico during 1910-1930. Many of these
immigrants have large families and are desperately poor, leading to
abusive child labor. Five-year-old Manuel, standing on a mountain
of oyster shells, is a shrimp picker in Biloxi, Miss. He has worked
at the cannery for a year and speaks no English.
</P>
<P>
   1912: New York deli owner Richard Hellmann begins packing his
mayonnaise in glass jars. The product is such a success that he
gives up the deli in 1915 and devotes his energy to manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   1913: General Electric markets toasters, irons and an electric
range.
</P>
<P>
   1914: The first electric refrigerator is introduced for
commercial use, but it's not until after World War I that the
miracle machines are widely available. By 1937, more than 2 million
American households have a new refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   1914: Campbell's promotes its soups as a recipe ingredient to
help the much-burdened housewife.
</P>
<P>
   1914: Lettuce, asparagus, watermelons, cantaloupes and tomatoes
grown in irrigated fields in California are transported 3,000 miles
away in refrigerated rail cars.
</P>
<P>
   1914: George Washington Carver's experiments prove the value of
peanuts and sweet potatoes in replenishing soil fertility.
</P>
<P>
   1914: The Reuben sandwich is created at Reuben's Restaurant in
New York City. (This claim, however, is hotly disputed by
Cornhuskers. Nebraskans believe the sandwich was created in 1922 by
grocer Reuben Kolakofsky during a poker game at the Blackstone
Hotel in Omaha.) (MORE) &QL;

BATTLE FLARES OVER FUNDING FOR TOBACCO EDUCATION &HT;

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    By CLAY ROBISON 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Health-care providers and advocates were of one
mind last year when the state negotiated its $17.3 billion deal
with the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   The cigarette companies' payments to the state should go to
health care or related programs, they insisted.
</P>
<P>
   Now, blessed with the windfall of riches, some health promoters
are fighting each other over how much money should initially be
spent on a key, underfunded program to discourage Texans from
smoking.
</P>
<P>
   The American Cancer Society of Texas, the American Lung
Association's Texas division and the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids
_ a single-interest, anti-tobacco group _ are waging an uphill
battle against key legislative budget-writers, the Texas Medical
Association and the rest of the state's health-care and advocacy
establishment.
</P>
<P>
   They want lawmakers to budget $82 million over the next two
years for a tobacco education program, which would include
aggressive television advertising, community outreach and other
efforts to reduce smoking.
</P>
<P>
   The cancer society insists that $82 million is necessary to make
a dent against smoking in a state as populous as Texas, where 23
percent of adults smoke and teen smoking is believed to be on the
rise.
</P>
<P>
   A proposed two-year budget for 2000-01 approved last week by the
House Appropriations Committee would set aside $200 million of the
tobacco settlement proceeds for a smoking-reduction program. But,
under related legislation, the money would be in the form of an
endowment, and only the earnings _ an estimated $20 million over
the next two years _ would actually be spent to fight smoking.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a hard time with that because we know it takes more
for a successful prevention program,'' said Cindy Antolik, director
of government relations for the American Cancer Society's Texas
division.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think there's plenty of money for health care and also
prevention in the tobacco settlement.''
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature will have about $1.8 billion in tobacco funds
either to spend outright or to establish endowments in the new
budget. The amount represents the first few payments _ plus
interest _ that cigarette companies are making under the 25-year
payout agreement they negotiated to settle a lawsuit brought by
former Attorney General Dan Morales.
</P>
<P>
   Under the House Appropriations Committee's bill, the largest
outright appropriation _ as much as $179 million _ would go to the
children's health-insurance program, which is designed to expand
health coverage for children of the working poor.
</P>
<P>
   Money also would be distributed among a number of other
health-related initiatives, including other children's health-care
needs, drugs for the Department of Mental Health and Mental
Retardation and endowments for medical schools and other university
health-education programs.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the proposed distribution follows an
agreement that Morales made last year with state Rep. Rob Junell,
D-San Angelo, and state Sen. Bill Ratliff, R-Mount Pleasant, the
Legislature's budget chairmen.
</P>
<P>
   Junell said an endowment would significantly increase the Texas
Department of Health's funding for anti-smoking efforts. The agency
had only about $1.5 million, including federal funds, to spend this
year.
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent health department survey, 43 percent of
Texas high school students, nearly one-third of middle school
students and one in four sixth-graders use tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   But Junell said the state needs time to develop new tobacco
education programs and evaluate their effectiveness before
committing more funds.
</P>
<P>
   Ratliff, whose Senate Finance Committee is still deliberating
its version of the budget, also questioned the wisdom of spending
$82 million on anti-smoking programs now. He said that it was
better to save the money for long-term use.
</P>
<P>
   ``You may have done some good for one set of kids. But if you
run out of money, what happens to the next set of kids?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   The Junell-Ratliff approach has been endorsed by the Texas
Medical Association, the Texas Hospital Association, the American
Heart Association's Texas affiliate and a host of other health-care
providers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It ensures that there will be money there forever to fund
tobacco prevention programs,'' said Tom Banning, a lobbyist for the
Texas Academy of Family Physicians, which also is part of the
so-called Coalition for a Healthy Texas, which backs the two budget
chairmen.
</P>
<P>
   Antolik said the cancer society's $82 million request, which
would include about $21 million in start-up costs for the first
year and $61 million the second year, is based, in part, on
aggressive anti-smoking campaigns in Florida, California and
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   She said Florida, the first state to use tobacco settlement
proceeds to pay for an anti-smoking program, saw smoking among
teen-agers decline by more than 2 percent in the past year, meaning
about 31,000 middle school and high school students stopped smoking
or decided not to start.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida program, initially funded at $70 million, included
television spots and other advertising, which young people helped
create, that ridiculed smoking and tobacco executives.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL ADD END)
</P>
<P>
   But the Florida effort has been mired in recent controversy,
apparently caused partly by the change in administrations from the
late Democratic Gov. Lawton Chiles to Republican Gov. Jeb Bush, the
younger brother of Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Jeb Bush budgeted $61.5 million, a 12 percent reduction, for the
program next year, and Florida legislators have been fighting over
its future.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, George W. Bush has endorsed the concept of putting
some of the tobacco funds into long-term endowments but hasn't
taken sides on the anti-smoking program.
</P>
<P>
   ``He, at last check, was continuing to be aggressively
neutral,'' Antolik said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know what works in other states,'' added Kelly Boyles,
southern regional director for the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just can't do it'' for $10 million a year, she said.

   ``Our nation cannot do everything,'' says Mr. Clinton. For
instance, it can't require all politicians talking about Kosovo to
make sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Mr. Milosevic wants to do,'' Mr. Clinton says, ``is to
keep the land of Kosovo and rid it of its people.'' America's
central cities know how to do that.
</P>
<P>
   The argument continues over the use of ground troops in Kosovo.
Can't we just talk the Serbs into using airborne forces?
</P>
<P>
   Tax tip: You might want to write ``But Not That One'' on your
1040 after your name if it's Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Using U.S. fighter planes in the Balkans has meant a suspension
of patrolling Iraq's northern no-fly zone, reports say. Maybe
that's why they call it the no-fly zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have made tremendous progress in our efforts to address the
year 2000 computer problem,'' Mr. Clinton says. Have we stretched
it out, like Social Security, so it's now a 2003 bug?
</P>
<P>
   The White House Easter egg roll this week was the 121st one in
history. One of these times we'll have to ask Strom Thurmond how it
all got started.
</P>
<P>
   For the Easter egg roll, White House volunteers prepared 7,000
eggs. At Gov. Jesse Ventura's house in Minnesota that's called
breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Aunt Ilse from Oelwein is upset. She stored her spring clothes
in the attic over the winter and somehow they shrank.

   The baseball season opened this year with a Colorado-San Diego
game played on Easter in Mexico. The surprise was the Rockies.
After all, you expect Padres to work on Easter.

   &UR; MONICA STUFF IS A BUST &LR; 
 &UR; By DAVID GRIMES &QC;  &LR;  I have been searching night and day for the good
that has supposedly come out of the Clinton scandal and I think, at
last, I've found it: Monica Lewinsky memorabilia _ even the really
tacky stuff _ is not selling well.
</P>
<P>
   I will leave it to the pundits to decide whether our democracy
has been strengthened or weakened by the scandal; what, if any,
damage the office of the president has sustained and how long, if
at all, we must continue to endure Barbara Walters' celebrity
interviews.
</P>
<P>
   All I know is if the American people, after going through all
this, are reluctant to spend their hard-earned money on Monica
Bobbing Dolls or Monica Lewinsky Down-On-Your-Knees Hot Sauce, then
there is hope for our great nation after all.
</P>
<P>
   According to an article in The Washington Post by David Segal,
entrepreneurs who hoped to use our national disgrace for personal
enrichment have been sorely disappointed. Tim Flynn of New Jersey
has been pushing Monica Lewinsky ties on the Internet but so far
has yet to sell one.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not because the ties aren't sufficiently tacky. The
$7.89, Korean-made ties feature a cigar, a brunette humanoid who
could be Monica or, perhaps, Marlo Thomas, and the word ``Tabu''
blaring out from a cheesy, fire-engine-red polyester blend.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a bomb,'' Flynn said. ``Everybody thinks Monica is hot,
and it's a big fallacy. After a certain amount of time, this stuff
is going to be worthless.''
</P>
<P>
   That certain amount of time may have expired. Why is Monica
kitsch selling so poorly? Experts say Americans are keeping their
wallets and pocketbooks tightly shut because the whole scandal was
just too ... unseemly.
</P>
<P>
   Think about it. A country that tripped over itself buying velour
Elvis wall hangings, Pope John Paul lawn sprinklers and Spiro
Agnew/Mickey Mouse wristwatches has some standards after all. Low
standards, admittedly, but standards nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   OK, I hear what you're saying. You're saying, ``Dave, it's one
thing to pass on Monica Lewinsky's Down-On-Your-Knees Hot Sauce _
there are, after all, a lot of other quality hot sauces out there _
but what if Monica gets her famous blue Gap dress back and decides
to sell it? What kind of standards will we have then, huh?''
</P>
<P>
   A good question and a fair question. For an answer let us hear
from Vredy Lytsman, a spokeswoman for the august, prestigious
auction house, Christie's: ``We're an established business, and
there are just certain things where you have to draw the line. Even
if there were a lot of money in it, we wouldn't do it. It's just
unethical.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention pretty darn nasty.
</P>
<P>
   All of which is not to say that some people aren't buying some
Monica memorabilia. A Seattle company, MMD Global Marketing Inc.,
has sold a few thousand Monica yo-yos. The yo-yos, which cost
$14.95, have the president's caricature on one side and Monica's on
the other. Each comes with a booklet of helpful hints about tricks
like ``robbing the cradle'' and ``around the office.''
</P>
<P>
   A $49 set of Russian nesting dolls bearing the likenesses of
Kenneth Starr, Henry Hyde, Linda Tripp and Lucianne Goldberg is
also selling well, according to the Post story.
</P>
<P>
   What kind of sucker buys this stuff?
</P>
<P>
   As someone who has invested a small fortune in baseball cards
only to see his collection depreciate steadily until it is now
barely worth its weight in bathroom tissue, I would seem a likely
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   And I probably would have thrown away some money by now were it
not for the fact that Bobbing Head dolls give me a migraine and hot
sauce upsets my stomach.
</P>
<P>
   The yo-yos, though ... they sound pretty cool.

   The third installment in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution's
yearlong Christianity 2000 series, a detailed look at Christianity
as we approach the millennium, is available now with an embargo
date of Saturday, April 10. This package of stories offers a
historical perspective on the church in Europe, with its roots in
Martin Luther and the Protestant Reformation, and examines why the
European church today faces serious problems. Here is a budget of
the stories and graphics in the package:
</P>
<P>
   MILLENNIUM-LUTHERAN _ On Oct. 31, 1517, Martin Luther tacked a
paper to the Palace Church door in Wittenberg, sparking a movement
that changed Christianity. But the church Luther founded finds
itself in deep trouble in Europe, where the Lutheran World
Federation reported a ``general reduction in numbers.'' And the
problem is even greater in Germany, the homeland of Protestanism,
where more than a million people have left the church rolls in the
1990s. (Gwhite, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 67. WITH PHOTOS.
</P>
<P>
   WITH
</P>
<P>
   MILLENNIUM-PROTESTANTS _ Most German Protestants spend little
time in the pews, but the history of northern Germany, the
birthplace of the Protestant Reformation, can be traced through
three churches: The Palace Church in Wittenberg where Luther nailed
the theses that started the Reformation; the Berliner Dom, or great
emperial cathedral, that survived the tremendous forces that shaped
20th century East Berlin; and, St. Michael's in Hamburg, a city
famous for its churches and its red-light district, where the
rebuilding of St. Michael's after World War II has become a major
point of pride for the city. (Gwhite, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 30. WITH PHOTOS.
</P>
<P>
   MILLENNIUM-LUTHER _ Although Catholic monk Martin Luther never
intended to form his own church, millions of Christians around the
world are now in a family of denominations that bear his name.
Millions more are in other groups _ Reformed, Methodist,
Presbyterian _ that are part of the Protestant Reformation Luther
sparked. A brief bio of Luther. Photo. (Gwhite, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 12.5.
</P>
<P>
   MILLENNIUM-BOX _ Although the government of Germany collects
funds for the Protestant and Catholic churches along with income
tax, many people have chosen to disaffiliate themselves from the
faith. And many of those who still pay money to the church seldom
attend. We take a quick look at the numbers. (Gwhite, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 7.5
</P>
<P>
   MILLENNIUM-ENGLAND _ The Church of England has become a stodgy,
picturesque part of the British Isles. It is a place tourists
visit, but a church in which few British are actually involved.
(Roughton, Cox News Service). 20.
</P>
<P>
   EDs: Two graphics are available with this package:
MILLENNIUM-CHART, A country-by-country chart of European religious
affiliation and MILLENNIUM-TIMELINE, a detailed look at the
highlights of Christianity through the Middle Ages. (Both graphics
are being produced by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution Art
Department).

   Although the government of Germany collects funds for the
Protestant and Catholic churches along with income tax, many people
have chosen to disaffiliate themselves from the faith. And many of
those who still pay money to the church seldom attend. Here's a
snapshot of the state of Protestantism in Germany today:
</P>
<P>
   -- Losing members: Studies from the Evangelische Kirche in
Deutschland (EKD), the umbrella organization of German Protestants,
show that the country's 24 regional churches lost nearly a million
members from 1992 until 1995. The hemorrhage continued, with more
than 200,000 fleeing the churches in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   -- Observing the sabbath: Of those who still identify themselves
as Protestant, few attend services although Germany has a
constitutionally protected Sunday when stores are closed. In a
December '97 report, the EKD estimated that weekly Protestant
church attendance in Germany is about 1.4 million _ or 4.9 percent
of the roughly 28 million members, except on Christmas Eve when
approximately a third of all members go to church.
</P>
<P>
   -- Beliefs track participation. A 1997 survey by the publication
Das Sonntagsblatt called ``What do the Germans believe'' showed
that 49 percent of Protestants and 35 percent of Catholics agreed
with the statement, ``I see myself as a Christian, but the church
means nothing to me.'' Six in 10 respondents to the poll said their
feelings were expressed in the statement, ``The churches have no
answers to questions that really concern me.''

<P>
   West Horsley, England _ It is a surprisingly bright morning on
the last Palm Sunday of the millennium in this village.
</P>
<P>
   Like the majority of people in this largely Christian country,
most villagers are pursuing pleasures outside in the rare English
sunshine, even though it is a holy day.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a small assembly of worshipers pull off a busy highway on
the outskirts of town, park their cars in a muddy lot and enter an
ancient church that is older than the diminishing national faith
that is practiced there.
</P>
<P>
   St. Mary's, the Anglican parish church of West Horsley, was
erected in 1030, while the Anglican Church of England is relatively
youthful by British standards at just over 450 years old.
</P>
<P>
   But the old traditions of the Church of England and the country
are sometimes blamed for the religious apathy that is now
widespread in the nation. ``Our message has soaked up the culture,
and the culture has fossilized into yesteryear,'' says the Rev.
Peter Robinson, rector of West Horsley Anglican Parish Church.
</P>
<P>
   The Anglican Church of England first began in 1534, when a
monarch _ who is better remembered for beheading his wives _ wanted
a divorce.
</P>
<P>
   England's King Henry VIII wanted out of his marriage so he could
marry his mistress, Anne Boleyn. But Pope Clement VII refused to
grant the king an annulment, so Henry broke with the papacy and
became ``supreme ruler of the faith.'' It was his daughter,
Elizabeth I, who established the independent, Anglican Church of
England by proclaiming the Protestant ``Book of Common Prayers''
the official national liturgy.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next three centuries, Anglicanism was spread throughout
the once global British empire, including the American colonies,
where it evolved into the autonomous Episcopal Church. Today the
worldwide Anglican Communion has 73 million members.
</P>
<P>
   The Anglican Church of England is structurally much as it was in
the days of Elizabeth I. The monarch, a second Elizabeth, continues
to preside over the country's official national faith. And the
church and government are still intertwined, with church law often
the law of the land.
</P>
<P>
   Although The Church of England remains the spiritual center of
Anglicanism, the major growth of the faith comes from other nations
in the worldwide Anglican Communion. The mostly evangelical
Anglicans in Africa and Asia now represent almost one third of the
church's global community.
</P>
<P>
   The 27 million member African Anglican Church often took the
lead in policy debates at the denomination's recent Lambeth
Conference, a meeting of the worldwide Anglican Communion held
every 10 years in Canterbury, England. Their conservative,
biblically literal interpretation of Anglicanism influenced the
Conference rulings to maintain the condemnation of homosexuality as
a sin and prevent the ordination of women as a clerical mandate.
</P>
<P>
   First introduced to the Anglican faith by British missionaries,
African Anglicans have now outgrown their English parent church.
``Those we ministered to now minister to us,'' says Jim Rosenthal,
spokesman for the Anglican Worldwide Communion, headquartered in
Canterbury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can foresee an Archbishop of Canterbury from Africa or
Asia,'' says West Horsley Parish's Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   The Most Reverend Right Honorable George Carey is the current
archbishop, the official head of The Church of England and the
``unifying symbol'' of the worldwide Anglican Communion. Like all
of his predecessors, he is British.
</P>
<P>
   ``A non-English archbishop is a possibility,'' said Rosenthal,
``but based on current tradition, he must swear allegiance to the
British monarch and I don't see that changing.''
</P>
<P>
   The zealous style of evangelism that Africa introduced to the
church has achieved results that would have daunted their staid
English forebears. While third world numbers boom, Anglican
religious practice in England is often as reserved and understated
as the nation's reputation.
</P>
<P>
   There are only 1.3 million members on the electoral roles of
England's 13,000 parishes, about 2.6 percent of the country's 50
million inhabitants. But according to the British government's own
1999 handbook, ``many people who rarely, if ever attend services
still regard themselves as belonging to the Church of England.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't help that local football and rugby matches are
regularly scheduled on Sunday mornings,'' says Stephen Jenkins,
press officer for the Anglican Church of England. Jenkins defends
declining church attendance statistics by pointing out that the
surveys don't take into account the habits of contemporary
believers.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson cites another reason; the ``irrelevance'' of the church
in the lives of most English citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``The church must reach out or die out,'' says Robinson. ``We
can learn a lot from our African colleagues,'' he adds.
</P>
<P>
   British churches have developed their own evangelical efforts to
combat religious indifference. Programs like the ``Alpha Course,''
promoted as a practical introduction to Christianity, have spread
throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   But these efforts are often viewed suspiciously by more
traditional, ``high church,'' Catholic-oriented British Anglicans.
``We are an island, both literally and mentally,'' says Robinson
about resistance to change in the mother country.
</P>
<P>
   For many English citizens, the most startling change of all
would be the separation of the church from the state. With 26
Anglican bishops sitting in the House of Lords and religious
education mandatory in the schools, the partnership between the two
bodies is almost seamless. But with speculation that the House of
Lords will disband and that the next monarch, Charles, will be a
``defender of faith,'' not ``the'' faith, the talk of
disestablishment also grows.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would not necessarily be a bad thing,'' says Robinson. ``A
spirit-led church that is not reliant on the government could
motivate a tremendous revival.'' While Rosenthal, of the Anglican
Worldwide Communion, agrees that parishioners need to take
ownership of their own churches, he believes the legal structure of
the English parish church system ``assures a religious center to
the community.''
</P>
<P>
   The duties of an English parish priest are principally the same
as they have been for half of this millennium. In West Horsely
Village, Robinson tends to the souls of his small congregation and
solemnizes the baptisms, weddings and funerals of his parishioners,
whether church members or not. ``By law, I must even bury atheists
if they live within my parish,'' he says with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in a pew in the rector's dusky church, the century could
just as easily be the 16th as the 20th. Aged, wooden beams secure
chapel walls that have stood almost 1000 years.
</P>
<P>
   But walking outside, the speeding cars on the highway in front
of St. Mary's are a reminder that time has moved on. And the
Anglican leaders, in England and around the planet, now prepare to
minister to a complicated new world that would have baffled and
bewildered the restless king and powerful daughter who gave birth
to their faith.

<P>
   Although Catholic monk Martin Luther never intended to form his
own church, 61.5 million Christians around the world are now in a
family of denominations that bear his name.
</P>
<P>
   Millions more are in other groups _ Reformed, Methodist,
Presbyterian _ that are part of the Protestant Reformation Luther
sparked.
</P>
<P>
   Luther was born Nov. 10, 1483, in Saxony, the son of a miner.
While studying for the law, he gave his life to God and became an
Augustinian monk.
</P>
<P>
   He reached adulthood when Europe, or the collection of assorted
countries and principalities that dominated it, was in flux. The
``new world'' had recently been discovered by Christopher Columbus.
The plague known as the Black Death periodically threatened death.
{swept the continent.? The printing press had unleashed a flood of
literature to those who could read.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, much power remained in the hands of local princes,
some of whom also served as Catholic bishops, appointed by the
pope.
</P>
<P>
   Examining the scriptures as a professor of biblical studies,
Luther became convinced that faith alone _ through the power of
Jesus _ brings about salvation. His position placed him directly at
odds with the hierarchy of the Catholic church which was, at the
time, selling indulgences or grants of forgiveness of sin.
</P>
<P>
   The more Luther studied, the greater his frustration became
until he marched down the street of Wittenberg and pounded his 95
Theses to the door of the Palace Church on Oct. 31, 1517. The
church served not only the ruling family of the region, but also
the university where Luther taught.
</P>
<P>
   The core principle of Luther's document stated that only God can
remit guilt and does so only when a sinner repents.
</P>
<P>
   Luther maintained that he intended only to stimulate discussion.
Instead, he started a firestorm that eventually led to his
excommunication by the pope, who called him ``a boar in the
vineyard of the Lord,'' and his condemnation by the Diet of Worms,
which referred to him as ``a demon in monk's garb.''
</P>
<P>
   Luther, meanwhile, continued writing and produced his own
translation of the New Testament in German.
</P>
<P>
   No longer a monk committed to celibacy, Luther married Katharina
von Bora, a former nun, on June 13, 1525. Together they had six
children and adopted four more.
</P>
<P>
   The family lived in Luther's former monastery, which had been
dissolved. It is now a museum.
</P>
<P>
   Luther died Feb. 18, 1546.

   Wittenberg: Roots of Lutherism can be traced to this German town

   RELIGION WRITER
</P>
<P>
   Wittenberg
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Schelhaas, small and earnest, pops around the counter of
a bright, warm information center to greet guests as pellets of
snow fall outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you like to see a video about Wittenberg?'' he asks.
``Twenty minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Will it tell about Martin Luther?'' a visitor wants to know.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without Luther, there is nothing to tell.''
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 31, 1517, Luther tacked his famous ``95 Theses'' to the
Palace Church door across the street from what is now Schelhaas's
little domain and sparked a movement that challenged Catholicism
and changed Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   The church has been destroyed and rebuilt twice _ first by fire,
then by Napoleon's army. The door has been replaced by a brass
replica. But Luther's nail hole still defines this town.
</P>
<P>
   As one pamphlet on Wittenberg says, ``We have the door _ and we
make a living out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Schelhaas hopes to use Luther's heritage to make this village on
the northern bank of the River Elbe into a destination for
tourists, pilgrims and scholars interested in the birth of the
Protestant Reformation. He imagines 2000 as a ``Holy Year'' in
three great centers of the faith: Jerusalem, Rome and Wittenberg.
</P>
<P>
   His efforts are accelerating as the church Luther founded finds
itself in deep trouble in Europe, where the Lutheran World
Federation reported a ``general reduction in numbers,'' and
especially in its homeland of Germany, where more than a million
people have left the church rolls in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The state of the church is at its worst in the former East
Germany _ which includes Wittenberg _ where decades of communist
rule after World War II stifled Christianity. Ten years after the
fall of the Berlin Wall, there is little evidence that religion is
making a comeback. In the former German Democratic Republic,
three-fourths of the population does not identify with any
Christian group.
</P>
<P>
   Anga Winkler, 19, illustrates the effects of communism. The high
school student from East Berlin identifies herself in terms of
religion as ``nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents aren't religious,'' she says, ``and they never
asked me what I wanted to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Such talk may have Luther spinning in his tomb below the pulpit
of the Palace Church. The crux of his famous theses is that faith
alone _ through the power of Jesus _ brings about salvation.
</P>
<P>
   From a movement within the Catholic church, Lutheranism
eventually became a separate denomination and the starting point
for the Protestant Reformation that became the dominant religious
force throughout much of Europe and North America.
</P>
<P>
   Today, each of 24 regions of Germany has its own Protestant
church _ some Lutheran, some the ``unified'' church that is both
Lutheran and Reformed, and a few Reformed. These are considered
``state churches'' and funds for them are collected by the
government along with income taxes from anyone identified as a
member.
</P>
<P>
   Some German churchmen say this official relationship has done
almost as much to damage the church in western Germany as decades
of communism did in the east.
</P>
<P>
   In America, churches compete with each other for members, said
the Rev. Uwe Hollm, 68, a retired probst _ or administrator _ of
the state church in Berlin. ``In Germany, tter the region had come
under control of Prussia. Its sanctuary, much more elaborate than
the original simple room, serves as a memorial to the Reformation.
It is lined with statues of Reformation figures and its balcony
railings feature the seals of princes who split away from
Catholicism to support Luther's movement.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Wednesday in Wittenberg, a pony-tailed pastor in
black slacks and a taupe sports coat conducted the regular mid-week
service in the famous church. He read Psalm 91 _ ``You who live in
the shelter of the Most High, who abide in the shadow of the
Almighty, will say to the Lord, `My refuge and my fortress ... '.''
_ and spoke briefly from notes.
</P>
<P>
   The statues outnumbered the congregation.
</P>
<P>
   Church of Prussian pride
</P>
<P>
   Called by a guidebook an ``ostentatious symbol of monarchical
power,'' the Berliner Dom was completed in 1905 as the cathedral of
the last German emperor, William II.
</P>
<P>
   This was the ``church of Prussian pride,'' according to Frank
Haussler, a theologian who once worked as a tour guide in the Dom.
In the days it was being built, the monarch was head of the church
as well as head of the state.
</P>
<P>
   To accommodate the royals, an underground passage led from the
palace across the street to an elaborate wooden staircase in the
cathedral, which, in turn, took the emperor to his special box.
Lest anyone miss its significance, the imperial gallery was
decorated with a gilded Prussian eagle holding a crown.
</P>
<P>
   Until the end of World War I, the royal House of Hohenszollern
used the cathedral for special family and governmental occasions.
After the emperor's abdication in 1918, officials of the new Weimar
Republic continued to hold special ceremonies in the church.
</P>
<P>
   In 1933, in an effort to influence church as well as state, the
newly empowered Adolf Hitler introduced the idea of a Reichbishop,
or national bishop, in the Berliner Dom.
</P>
<P>
   After Hitler's ignominious end, the communists in control of
East Berlin tore down the palace across the street and built a pink
glass party headquarters building on its site. That building now
stands empty, marked with graffiti. But party leaders let the Dom
stand. It remained seriously damaged from World War II bombs until
the late 1970s when repair work on the exterior began. The work
continues.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the golden cross on top of the dom shines over a unified
Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   The jewel of Hamburg
</P>
<P>
   In the back of the magnificent Michaeliskirche _ in English the
Church of St. Michael _ sexton Tobias Jahn is nearly nose-to-nose
with a tour guide. The woman, it seems, wants to show her bus load
of tourists around the ornate sanctuary of the church. Jahn is
balking because in less than half an hour the city's new Protestant
bishop _ the first woman to hold that office _ will preside over a
special service at which the Catholic archbishop is a guest.
</P>
<P>
   Jahn and the woman argue until the guide and her troupe meekly
walk down the aisle and take seats to stay for worship. Jahn goes
back to sticking worship bulletins into hymnals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Michel,'' as Hamburgers affectionately call it, is the
most famous of the churches whose towers define the skyline of the
city, which seems as much Dutch, British or Scandinavian as German.
The copper tower of the church, green with patina, greets ships
entering the port of Hamburg.
</P>
<P>
   While St. Katherine's and St. Jacob's churches were
reconstructed with modern fixtures after World War II and only the
tower of St. Nicholas remains, St. Michael's was restored to all
its former glory.
</P>
<P>
   Jahn is the church's guardian. And tourists are both boon and
bane to him and his church.
</P>
<P>
   Many Protestant churches in northern Germany stand nearly empty
on Sundays, but ``The Michel'' consistently draws a congregation of
about 500 to its 3,000-seat sanctuary. Fewer than 150 are members
of the 8,000-person parish. The rest are tourists or guests.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the church may be the city's second most famous tourist
stop, behind the famous Reeperbahn, or red-light district, just
three or four blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   Before Sunday services are over and the bishops have left the
building, tourists in sweat suits with cameras are already buying
tickets to see the church at a booth in the vestibule. Also on sale
are St. Michael's espresso cups, medallions and watches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michel is a wonderful church, the attraction of Hamburg,''
said opera mezzo-soprano Corinna Meyer-Esche. She is in the balcony
of the church for services with her daughter, Antonia, 7, who was
baptized in the church. Meyer-Esche has attended St. Michael's
occasionally since she moved to Hamburg 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   She is undaunted by the tourists. ``I think it's OK to have
them,'' she said. ``I think it's important.''
</P>
<P>
   But, she said, she comes because of ``my own history, my own
feelings. It's community.''

   The third installment in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution's
yearlong Christianity 2000 series, a detailed look at Christianity
as we approach the millennium, is available now with an embargo
date of Saturday, April 10. This package of stories offers a
historical perspective on the church in Europe, with its roots in
Martin Luther and the Protestant Reformation, and examines why the
European church today faces serious problems. Here is a budget of
the stories and graphics in the package:
</P>
<P>
   MILLENNIUM-LUTHERAN _ On Oct. 31, 1517, Martin Luther tacked a
paper to the Palace Church door in Wittenberg, sparking a movement
that changed Christianity. But the church Luther founded finds
itself in deep trouble in Europe, where the Lutheran World
Federation reported a ``general reduction in numbers.'' And the
problem is even greater in Germany, the homeland of Protestanism,
where more than a million people have left the church rolls in the
1990s. (Gwhite, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 67. WITH PHOTOS.
</P>
<P>
   WITH
</P>
<P>
   MILLENNIUM-PROTESTANTS _ Most German Protestants spend little
time in the pews, but the history of northern Germany, the
birthplace of the Protestant Reformation, can be traced through
three churches: The Palace Church in Wittenberg where Luther nailed
the theses that started the Reformation; the Berliner Dom, or great
emperial cathedral, that survived the tremendous forces that shaped
20th century East Berlin; and, St. Michael's in Hamburg, a city
famous for its churches and its red-light district, where the
rebuilding of St. Michael's after World War II has become a major
point of pride for the city. (Gwhite, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 30. WITH PHOTOS.
</P>
<P>
   MILLENNIUM-LUTHER _ Although Catholic monk Martin Luther never
intended to form his own church, millions of Christians around the
world are now in a family of denominations that bear his name.
Millions more are in other groups _ Reformed, Methodist,
Presbyterian _ that are part of the Protestant Reformation Luther
sparked. A brief bio of Luther. Photo. (Gwhite, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 12.5.
</P>
<P>
   MILLENNIUM-BOX _ Although the government of Germany collects
funds for the Protestant and Catholic churches along with income
tax, many people have chosen to disaffiliate themselves from the
faith. And many of those who still pay money to the church seldom
attend. We take a quick look at the numbers. (Gwhite, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 7.5
</P>
<P>
   MILLENNIUM-ENGLAND _ The Church of England has become a stodgy,
picturesque part of the British Isles. It is a place tourists
visit, but a church in which few British are actually involved.
(Roughton, Cox News Service). 20.
</P>
<P>
   EDs: Two graphics are available with this package:
MILLENNIUM-CHART, A country-by-country chart of European religious
affiliation and MILLENNIUM-TIMELINE, a detailed look at the
highlights of Christianity through the Middle Ages. (Both graphics
are being produced by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution Art
Department).

   Although the government of Germany collects funds for the
Protestant and Catholic churches along with income tax, many people
have chosen to disaffiliate themselves from the faith. And many of
those who still pay money to the church seldom attend. Here's a
snapshot of the state of Protestantism in Germany today:
</P>
<P>
   -- Losing members: Studies from the Evangelische Kirche in
Deutschland (EKD), the umbrella organization of German Protestants,
show that the country's 24 regional churches lost nearly a million
members from 1992 until 1995. The hemorrhage continued, with more
than 200,000 fleeing the churches in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   -- Observing the sabbath: Of those who still identify themselves
as Protestant, few attend services although Germany has a
constitutionally protected Sunday when stores are closed. In a
December '97 report, the EKD estimated that weekly Protestant
church attendance in Germany is about 1.4 million _ or 4.9 percent
of the roughly 28 million members, except on Christmas Eve when
approximately a third of all members go to church.
</P>
<P>
   -- Beliefs track participation. A 1997 survey by the publication
Das Sonntagsblatt called ``What do the Germans believe'' showed
that 49 percent of Protestants and 35 percent of Catholics agreed
with the statement, ``I see myself as a Christian, but the church
means nothing to me.'' Six in 10 respondents to the poll said their
feelings were expressed in the statement, ``The churches have no
answers to questions that really concern me.''

   West Horsley, England _ It is a surprisingly bright morning on
the last Palm Sunday of the millennium in this village.
</P>
<P>
   Like the majority of people in this largely Christian country,
most villagers are pursuing pleasures outside in the rare English
sunshine, even though it is a holy day.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a small assembly of worshipers pull off a busy highway on
the outskirts of town, park their cars in a muddy lot and enter an
ancient church that is older than the diminishing national faith
that is practiced there.
</P>
<P>
   St. Mary's, the Anglican parish church of West Horsley, was
erected in 1030, while the Anglican Church of England is relatively
youthful by British standards at just over 450 years old.
</P>
<P>
   But the old traditions of the Church of England and the country
are sometimes blamed for the religious apathy that is now
widespread in the nation. ``Our message has soaked up the culture,
and the culture has fossilized into yesteryear,'' says the Rev.
Peter Robinson, rector of West Horsley Anglican Parish Church.
</P>
<P>
   The Anglican Church of England first began in 1534, when a
monarch _ who is better remembered for beheading his wives _ wanted
a divorce.
</P>
<P>
   England's King Henry VIII wanted out of his marriage so he could
marry his mistress, Anne Boleyn. But Pope Clement VII refused to
grant the king an annulment, so Henry broke with the papacy and
became ``supreme ruler of the faith.'' It was his daughter,
Elizabeth I, who established the independent, Anglican Church of
England by proclaiming the Protestant ``Book of Common Prayers''
the official national liturgy.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next three centuries, Anglicanism was spread throughout
the once global British empire, including the American colonies,
where it evolved into the autonomous Episcopal Church. Today the
worldwide Anglican Communion has 73 million members.
</P>
<P>
   The Anglican Church of England is structurally much as it was in
the days of Elizabeth I. The monarch, a second Elizabeth, continues
to preside over the country's official national faith. And the
church and government are still intertwined, with church law often
the law of the land.
</P>
<P>
   Although The Church of England remains the spiritual center of
Anglicanism, the major growth of the faith comes from other nations
in the worldwide Anglican Communion. The mostly evangelical
Anglicans in Africa and Asia now represent almost one third of the
church's global community.
</P>
<P>
   The 27 million member African Anglican Church often took the
lead in policy debates at the denomination's recent Lambeth
Conference, a meeting of the worldwide Anglican Communion held
every 10 years in Canterbury, England. Their conservative,
biblically literal interpretation of Anglicanism influenced the
Conference rulings to maintain the condemnation of homosexuality as
a sin and prevent the ordination of women as a clerical mandate.
</P>
<P>
   First introduced to the Anglican faith by British missionaries,
African Anglicans have now outgrown their English parent church.
``Those we ministered to now minister to us,'' says Jim Rosenthal,
spokesman for the Anglican Worldwide Communion, headquartered in
Canterbury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can foresee an Archbishop of Canterbury from Africa or
Asia,'' says West Horsley Parish's Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   The Most Reverend Right Honorable George Carey is the current
archbishop, the official head of The Church of England and the
``unifying symbol'' of the worldwide Anglican Communion. Like all
of his predecessors, he is British.
</P>
<P>
   ``A non-English archbishop is a possibility,'' said Rosenthal,
``but based on current tradition, he must swear allegiance to the
British monarch and I don't see that changing.''
</P>
<P>
   The zealous style of evangelism that Africa introduced to the
church has achieved results that would have daunted their staid
English forebears. While third world numbers boom, Anglican
religious practice in England is often as reserved and understated
as the nation's reputation.
</P>
<P>
   There are only 1.3 million members on the electoral roles of
England's 13,000 parishes, about 2.6 percent of the country's 50
million inhabitants. But according to the British government's own
1999 handbook, ``many people who rarely, if ever attend services
still regard themselves as belonging to the Church of England.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't help that local football and rugby matches are
regularly scheduled on Sunday mornings,'' says Stephen Jenkins,
press officer for the Anglican Church of England. Jenkins defends
declining church attendance statistics by pointing out that the
surveys don't take into account the habits of contemporary
believers.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson cites another reason; the ``irrelevance'' of the church
in the lives of most English citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``The church must reach out or die out,'' says Robinson. ``We
can learn a lot from our African colleagues,'' he adds.
</P>
<P>
   British churches have developed their own evangelical efforts to
combat religious indifference. Programs like the ``Alpha Course,''
promoted as a practical introduction to Christianity, have spread
throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   But these efforts are often viewed suspiciously by more
traditional, ``high church,'' Catholic-oriented British Anglicans.
``We are an island, both literally and mentally,'' says Robinson
about resistance to change in the mother country.
</P>
<P>
   For many English citizens, the most startling change of all
would be the separation of the church from the state. With 26
Anglican bishops sitting in the House of Lords and religious
education mandatory in the schools, the partnership between the two
bodies is almost seamless. But with speculation that the House of
Lords will disband and that the next monarch, Charles, will be a
``defender of faith,'' not ``the'' faith, the talk of
disestablishment also grows.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would not necessarily be a bad thing,'' says Robinson. ``A
spirit-led church that is not reliant on the government could
motivate a tremendous revival.'' While Rosenthal, of the Anglican
Worldwide Communion, agrees that parishioners need to take
ownership of their own churches, he believes the legal structure of
the English parish church system ``assures a religious center to
the community.''
</P>
<P>
   The duties of an English parish priest are principally the same
as they have been for half of this millennium. In West Horsely
Village, Robinson tends to the souls of his small congregation and
solemnizes the baptisms, weddings and funerals of his parishioners,
whether church members or not. ``By law, I must even bury atheists
if they live within my parish,'' he says with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in a pew in the rector's dusky church, the century could
just as easily be the 16th as the 20th. Aged, wooden beams secure
chapel walls that have stood almost 1000 years.
</P>
<P>
   But walking outside, the speeding cars on the highway in front
of St. Mary's are a reminder that time has moved on. And the
Anglican leaders, in England and around the planet, now prepare to
minister to a complicated new world that would have baffled and
bewildered the restless king and powerful daughter who gave birth
to their faith.

<P>
   Although Catholic monk Martin Luther never intended to form his
own church, 61.5 million Christians around the world are now in a
family of denominations that bear his name.
</P>
<P>
   Millions more are in other groups _ Reformed, Methodist,
Presbyterian _ that are part of the Protestant Reformation Luther
sparked.
</P>
<P>
   Luther was born Nov. 10, 1483, in Saxony, the son of a miner.
While studying for the law, he gave his life to God and became an
Augustinian monk.
</P>
<P>
   He reached adulthood when Europe, or the collection of assorted
countries and principalities that dominated it, was in flux. The
``new world'' had recently been discovered by Christopher Columbus.
The plague known as the Black Death periodically threatened death.
{swept the continent.? The printing press had unleashed a flood of
literature to those who could read.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, much power remained in the hands of local princes,
some of whom also served as Catholic bishops, appointed by the
pope.
</P>
<P>
   Examining the scriptures as a professor of biblical studies,
Luther became convinced that faith alone _ through the power of
Jesus _ brings about salvation. His position placed him directly at
odds with the hierarchy of the Catholic church which was, at the
time, selling indulgences or grants of forgiveness of sin.
</P>
<P>
   The more Luther studied, the greater his frustration became
until he marched down the street of Wittenberg and pounded his 95
Theses to the door of the Palace Church on Oct. 31, 1517. The
church served not only the ruling family of the region, but also
the university where Luther taught.
</P>
<P>
   The core principle of Luther's document stated that only God can
remit guilt and does so only when a sinner repents.
</P>
<P>
   Luther maintained that he intended only to stimulate discussion.
Instead, he started a firestorm that eventually led to his
excommunication by the pope, who called him ``a boar in the
vineyard of the Lord,'' and his condemnation by the Diet of Worms,
which referred to him as ``a demon in monk's garb.''
</P>
<P>
   Luther, meanwhile, continued writing and produced his own
translation of the New Testament in German.
</P>
<P>
   No longer a monk committed to celibacy, Luther married Katharina
von Bora, a former nun, on June 13, 1525. Together they had six
children and adopted four more.
</P>
<P>
   The family lived in Luther's former monastery, which had been
dissolved. It is now a museum.
</P>
<P>
   Luther died Feb. 18, 1546.

   Wittenberg: Roots of Lutherism can be traced to this German town

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   RELIGION WRITER
</P>
<P>
   Wittenberg
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Schelhaas, small and earnest, pops around the counter of
a bright, warm information center to greet guests as pellets of
snow fall outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you like to see a video about Wittenberg?'' he asks.
``Twenty minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Will it tell about Martin Luther?'' a visitor wants to know.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without Luther, there is nothing to tell.''
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 31, 1517, Luther tacked his famous ``95 Theses'' to the
Palace Church door across the street from what is now Schelhaas's
little domain and sparked a movement that challenged Catholicism
and changed Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   The church has been destroyed and rebuilt twice _ first by fire,
then by Napoleon's army. The door has been replaced by a brass
replica. But Luther's nail hole still defines this town.
</P>
<P>
   As one pamphlet on Wittenberg says, ``We have the door _ and we
make a living out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Schelhaas hopes to use Luther's heritage to make this village on
the northern bank of the River Elbe into a destination for
tourists, pilgrims and scholars interested in the birth of the
Protestant Reformation. He imagines 2000 as a ``Holy Year'' in
three great centers of the faith: Jerusalem, Rome and Wittenberg.
</P>
<P>
   His efforts are accelerating as the church Luther founded finds
itself in deep trouble in Europe, where the Lutheran World
Federation reported a ``general reduction in numbers,'' and
especially in its homeland of Germany, where more than a million
people have left the church rolls in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The state of the church is at its worst in the former East
Germany _ which includes Wittenberg _ where decades of communist
rule after World War II stifled Christianity. Ten years after the
fall of the Berlin Wall, there is little evidence that religion is
making a comeback. In the former German Democratic Republic,
three-fourths of the population does not identify with any
Christian group.
</P>
<P>
   Anga Winkler, 19, illustrates the effects of communism. The high
school student from East Berlin identifies herself in terms of
religion as ``nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents aren't religious,'' she says, ``and they never
asked me what I wanted to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Such talk may have Luther spinning in his tomb below the pulpit
of the Palace Church. The crux of his famous theses is that faith
alone _ through the power of Jesus _ brings about salvation.
</P>
<P>
   From a movement within the Catholic church, Lutheranism
eventually became a separate denomination and the starting point
for the Protestant Reformation that became the dominant religious
force throughout much of Europe and North America.
</P>
<P>
   Today, each of 24 regions of Germany has its own Protestant
church _ some Lutheran, some the ``unified'' church that is both
Lutheran and Reformed, and a few Reformed. These are considered
``state churches'' and funds for them are collected by the
government along with income taxes from anyone identified as a
member.
</P>
<P>
   Some German churchmen say this official relationship has done
almost as much to damage the church in western Germany as decades
of communism did in the east.
</P>
<P>
   In America, churches compete with each other for members, said
the Rev. Uwe Hollm, 68, a retired probst _ or administrator _ of
the state church in Berlin. ``In Germany, this is not the case. If
you are born the child of Lutheran parents or a child of Roman
Catholic parents, you are in the church. You are confirmed, married
and buried. It's a very official thing. You see very few pious
people who have had a personal conversion.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollm, tall and thin, his gray hair cut like Julius Caesar,
speaks English with a bit of a British accent from time as a
minister in London. He has experienced both American and German
Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   A Hitler youth from age 9, he was devastated when he learned of
Adolf Hitler's suicide and further disturbed when he began to
realize the horrors of the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hitler was a divine person to us. If he had told me to jump
down a wall and kill myself, I would have done it.''
</P>
<P>
   After the war, in his mid-teens, Hollm said, ``I felt a deep
emptiness in my heart.'' The feeling began to dissipate at a camp
organized by American members of the Church of the Brethren in
Hamburg, near the North Sea coast. The following year he attended a
similar camp sponsored by First Presbyterian Church of Hollywood,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   From the Brethren, Hollm said, he learned about Christian
pacifism. From the Presbyterians, he learned ``that there could be
a personal relationship with God through prayer.''
</P>
<P>
   On a subsequent trip to the United States, while working with
his friends at Hollywood Presbyterian, Hollm decided to be a
minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``The call came because I saw a living, vibrant community of
Christian people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany today, he sees little evidence of life in the
churches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nominal membership is the normal thing,'' he said. ``Active
membership is the exception.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardiologist Lars Hennig, 39, who lives in the southwest section
of Berlin, considers himself a Lutheran and attends services about
once a month. ``Mostly there are some old people, not many young
people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hennig, who has visited church services in the United States,
said he is impressed with the family orientation of American
congregations _ which he says is decidedly lacking in German state
churches.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, alternative ``free churches'' not affiliated with the
state are having limited success in attracting fallen-away German
Christians.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a tendency for evangelicals to say our churches aren't
hurting like the Lutherans or Catholics, but they're hurting,
too,'' said the Rev. James Smith, Europe liaison for the
Atlanta-based Cooperative Baptist Fellowship. Figures from the
Union of Churches, a German free-church coalition, showed a
combined membership of 87,848 members, with losses of 962 people by
disaffiliation, in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Modern Germans just don't see much need for church,'' Smith
said. ``I think Europeans are just very skeptical about religion.
They don't really go to church. They don't practice anything.
They're very jealous of their free time. The weekend is holy.''
</P>
<P>
   In February, to celebrate its 100th anniversary and prepare
Berlin to assume its role as capital city of a unified Germany, the
church Smith attends, Charlottenburg Baptist Church in Berlin,
hosted a workshop for church leaders of state and free churches.
The featured speaker was one of America's most famous church growth
gurus, the Rev. Bill Hybels of Willow Creek Church in Illinois,
which regularly draws a combined attendance of more than 16,000 to
five weekend services. The church was filled, and German public
television recorded the conference to be televised in June.
</P>
<P>
   Hybels encouraged the churches to be relevant to people's lives
and to remember that their role is to change the city ``one person
at a time from within.''
</P>
<P>
   Luther had the same expectation of the church, according to
Frank Haussler, 32, a theologian and fervent Luther fan. Haussler
has degrees from the universities of Tubingen and Heidelberg _
world-renowned centers of Protestant scholarship _ but there is no
place for him as a pastor at a state church in Germany because of
declining membership.
</P>
<P>
   The German Protestant church has been consumed by
``self-secularization,'' Haussler said. Comfortable for years in
its guaranteed income, the church ``neglected its duty of preaching
the gospel to the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, while some churches are closed, many others have become
even more secular, serving almost exclusively as tourist sites or
concert halls.
</P>
<P>
   Haussler worked for a while at the Berlin Dom, the grand German
Protestant cathedral intended to rival St. Peter's Basilica, the
seat of the Catholic Church in Rome. He quit his job when the
cathedral began charging fees to tourists.
</P>
<P>
   ``And there is this big mosaic of Jesus, opening his arms,
saying, `Come to me you who are troubled','' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The fees are one way churches are trying to cope with shrinking
coffers as people in Germany increasingly take the initiative to go
through the paperwork and red tape to have themselves
``de-registered,'' or removed from the church rolls, thus ending
their obligation to pay the church through their taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Randolf Kaivies, 43, a native of West Berlin who owns a toy and
gift shop, is an example of the trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more people are jumping out of the church,'' he said.
``Me, I don't pay any more. On paper, I'm Protestant, but I don't
pay. Many people pay, not because they like it but because it's
automatic. You have to make many different processes to the
government not to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of waning membership and high unemployment, officials
estimated that between 1995 and 2000, churches will have lost 30
percent of their funds.
</P>
<P>
   The losses are threatening both congregations and historic
church buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The region of Sachsen-Anhalt, which includes Wittenberg and is
called ``Lutherland'' by the local tourist board, has an estimated
2,400 churches, many pre-dating Luther. Of those, only 5 percent
were classified as in ``a good state of repair,'' while 30 percent
``are in such bad condition that they should actually be abandoned
or demolished,'' according to a 1996 Church Buildings Conference.
</P>
<P>
   The two famous churches in Wittenberg _ the Palace Church,
rebuilt to honor the Reformation, and the Stadkirche St. Marien, or
City Church of St. Mary, where Luther preached _ escaped the
neglect specifically because of their ties to Luther.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the historic village of Wittenberg is thriving while
its region of the country suffers.
</P>
<P>
   Sachen-Anhalt is known as the poorest state in Germany in per
capita income, and 20 percent of its people are unemployed. But
Luther's old habitations, part of an industrial town of 50,000 now
often designated Lutherstadt-Wittenberg, shine with fresh, colorful
paint.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, to mark the 500th anniversary of Luther's birth, the
former East German government began a restoration program in
Wittenberg. The Wittenberg video in the information center gives
credit to celebrations of that occasion for starting the demise of
communist control of the old East Germany, officially the German
Democratic Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Since the unification of Germany, renovation has increased and
tourism is better, said Dieter Meinecke, a guide for the
information center. The East German government insisted on showing
only ``the best side of the town,'' he said. ``We had tourism, but
not the kind of tourism we can offer you now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lutherhalle, the former monastery which became Luther's
family home, is a museum. And visitors may also tour the home of
Phillip Schwarzerd, Luther's foremost lieutenant, who is generally
known as Melanchthon.
</P>
<P>
   The grandest event of the year in Wittenberg is a three-day
festival celebrating Luther's wedding, held annually in June since
1994. Local residents are chosen to portray the former monk and his
bride, a runaway Cistercian nun named Katherina von Bora. They
married in 1540.
</P>
<P>
   There are theater productions, music and handicrafts throughout
the town, drawing tens of thousands of tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Some go away with the favorite souvenirs of the visitors'
center, pairs of socks embroidered with Luther's famous saying in
defiance of the Catholic church: ``Here I stand, I can do no other,
so help me God.''
</P>
<P>
   The socks were the idea of a group of German Lutheran pastors,
Meinecke said. ``Guests are divided into two parts,'' he said.
``Fifty percent say they're great. Fifty percent say they're
horrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Efforts are under way to take advantage of Wittenberg's history
to make it a center of Protestant study. In February, Dean Bard
moved to Wittenberg to establish a center for the Evangelical
Lutheran Church in America, the largest Lutheran group in the
United States. Bard, 53, a Nebraska native, fell in love with
Berlin as a young man stationed there in the Air Force. He returned
home, attended seminary, and went back to Berlin to pastor an
English-language church.
</P>
<P>
   Bard is putting together ``substantial educational and spiritual
experiences'' for ministers, Lutheran lay leaders and college
students. He plans for the program eventually to include partner
churches from Africa and Asia. And, he hopes the center will serve
as a clearinghouse for scholars who want to tap into ``the
treasures of this area.''
</P>
<P>
   He sees the efforts to bring attention to Wittenberg as greater
than an economically motivated plan to increase tourism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a sign of something deeper going on
underneath,'' he says. ``These tangible symbols reflect deeper
realities sometimes. They're not only sprucing up the buildings,
but trying to revive the spiritual context.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The history of Christianity in Germany has been written _ and
rewritten _ in the walls and sanctuaries of its churches.
</P>
<P>
   From Catholicism to Reformation, through imperialism, Naziism
and communism, divided and reunited, churches in the land of Luther
have survived. Here are glimpses of three of them:
</P>
<P>
   Where Luther made his stand
</P>
<P>
   Martin Luther lies where he took his stand, here at the
Schlosskirche, or Palace Church, in Wittenberg. The father of the
Protestant Reformation is buried under a simple marker below the
elaborate pulpit of this old building with its wagon-wheel
chandelier and its stained-glass window of Christ on the cross.
Fresh flowers in a white pitcher honor his grave.
</P>
<P>
   On the door of this church in 1517, Luther nailed the 95 Theses
credited with inspiring the Protestant Reformation.
</P>
<P>
   In Luther's day the then-Catholic church was part of a palace of
Frederick of Saxony, known as Frederick the Wise, the ruling prince
of the region. When Luther rebelled against the pope, Frederick
strongly supported him.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the original building burned in 1760 during the Seven
Years War. It suffered severe damage again during the Napoleonic
Wars in 1813.
</P>
<P>
   Its present incarnation was completed between 1885 and 1892
under the crown prince and future Kaiser Friedrich III after the
region had come under control of Prussia. Its sanctuary, much more
elaborate than the original simple room, serves as a memorial to
the Reformation. It is lined with statues of Reformation figures
and its balcony railings feature the seals of princes who split
away from Catholicism to support Luther's movement.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Wednesday in Wittenberg, a pony-tailed pastor in
black slacks and a taupe sports coat conducted the regular mid-week
service in the famous church. He read Psalm 91 _ ``You who live in
the shelter of the Most High, who abide in the shadow of the
Almighty, will say to the Lord, `My refuge and my fortress ... '.''
_ and spoke briefly from notes.
</P>
<P>
   The statues outnumbered the congregation.
</P>
<P>
   Church of Prussian pride
</P>
<P>
   Called by a guidebook an ``ostentatious symbol of monarchical
power,'' the Berliner Dom was completed in 1905 as the cathedral of
the last German emperor, William II.
</P>
<P>
   This was the ``church of Prussian pride,'' according to Frank
Haussler, a theologian who once worked as a tour guide in the Dom.
In the days it was being built, the monarch was head of the church
as well as head of the state.
</P>
<P>
   To accommodate the royals, an underground passage led from the
palace across the street to an elaborate wooden staircase in the
cathedral, which, in turn, took the emperor to his special box.
Lest anyone miss its significance, the imperial gallery was
decorated with a gilded Prussian eagle holding a crown.
</P>
<P>
   Until the end of World War I, the royal House of Hohenszollern
used the cathedral for special family and governmental occasions.
After the emperor's abdication in 1918, officials of the new Weimar
Republic continued to hold special ceremonies in the church.
</P>
<P>
   In 1933, in an effort to influence church as well as state, the
newly empowered Adolf Hitler introduced the idea of a Reichbishop,
or national bishop, in the Berliner Dom.
</P>
<P>
   After Hitler's ignominious end, the communists in control of
East Berlin tore down the palace across the street and built a pink
glass party headquarters building on its site. That building now
stands empty, marked with graffiti. But party leaders let the Dom
stand. It remained seriously damaged from World War II bombs until
the late 1970s when repair work on the exterior began. The work
continues.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the golden cross on top of the dom shines over a unified
Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   The jewel of Hamburg
</P>
<P>
   In the back of the magnificent Michaeliskirche _ in English the
Church of St. Michael _ sexton Tobias Jahn is nearly nose-to-nose
with a tour guide. The woman, it seems, wants to show her bus load
of tourists around the ornate sanctuary of the church. Jahn is
balking because in less than half an hour the city's new Protestant
bishop _ the first woman to hold that office _ will preside over a
special service at which the Catholic archbishop is a guest.
</P>
<P>
   Jahn and the woman argue until the guide and her troupe meekly
walk down the aisle and take seats to stay for worship. Jahn goes
back to sticking worship bulletins into hymnals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Michel,'' as Hamburgers affectionately call it, is the
most famous of the churches whose towers define the skyline of the
city, which seems as much Dutch, British or Scandinavian as German.
The copper tower of the church, green with patina, greets ships
entering the port of Hamburg.
</P>
<P>
   While St. Katherine's and St. Jacob's churches were
reconstructed with modern fixtures after World War II and only the
tower of St. Nicholas remains, St. Michael's was restored to all
its former glory.
</P>
<P>
   Jahn is the church's guardian. And tourists are both boon and
bane to him and his church.
</P>
<P>
   Many Protestant churches in northern Germany stand nearly empty
on Sundays, but ``The Michel'' consistently draws a congregation of
about 500 to its 3,000-seat sanctuary. Fewer than 150 are members
of the 8,000-person parish. The rest are tourists or guests.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the church may be the city's second most famous tourist
stop, behind the famous Reeperbahn, or red-light district, just
three or four blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   Before Sunday services are over and the bishops have left the
building, tourists in sweat suits with cameras are already buying
tickets to see the church at a booth in the vestibule. Also on sale
are St. Michael's espresso cups, medallions and watches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michel is a wonderful church, the attraction of Hamburg,''
said opera mezzo-soprano Corinna Meyer-Esche. She is in the balcony
of the church for services with her daughter, Antonia, 7, who was
baptized in the church. Meyer-Esche has attended St. Michael's
occasionally since she moved to Hamburg 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   She is undaunted by the tourists. ``I think it's OK to have
them,'' she said. ``I think it's important.''
</P>
<P>
   But, she said, she comes because of ``my own history, my own
feelings. It's community.''

NATO GROUND TROOPS COULD FOLLOW TWO SCENARIOS IN YUGOSLAVIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As NATO forces unleashed a 15th day of air strikes
against Yugoslavia Wednesday, two scenarios were emerging for the
possible invasion by ground troops to force President Slobodan
Milosevic to end the war on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Clinton administration says there are no plans to
send NATO ground troops to Yugoslavia, the failure of the air war
to pressure Milosevic to withdraw his forces from Kosovo has
stirred speculation that NATO ground forces eventually will have to
complete the job.
</P>
<P>
   A NATO ground attack would face a formidable foe in Kosovo where
the Belgrade government has about 40,000 troops, 16,500 police, 300
Soviet tanks, 700 artillery pieces and 700 armored vehicles. In
addition, there are about 80,000 more soldiers, 1,200 tanks and
1,400 artillery pieces scattered throughout Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   A major goal of the ongoing NATO air campaign is to destroy much
of this military equipment that is being used to suppress or kill
ethnic Albanians. Other goals are to force Milosevic to restore
autonomy to the Yugoslav province and to allow NATO troops to
enforce a peace agreement there.
</P>
<P>
   One invasion plan _ the more wide-ranging and complex _ is being
proposed by retired Army Lt. Gen. William Odom, a former director
of the National Security Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Odom, writing in the Wall Street Journal, envisions an invasion
by 40,000 NATO troops led by tanks, sweeping south from Hungary
into Serbia down to the Yugoslav capital of Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The high-speed invasion force would travel down the same
corridor the Germans used successfully in World War II when the
Wehrmacht captured much of Yugoslavia in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Odom would couple the southward swoop with a separate thrust of
44,000 NATO troops pushing north through Macedonia to repel
Yugoslav forces stationed in Kosovo and create safe areas for
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The downside of the Odom plan is that it could take several
weeks or longer to prepare. The troops and materiel would have to
be flown into Hungary and the tanks and artillery likely would have
to move by rail and roads from Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``To put together a full-scale attack is going to take a long
time,'' said retired Army Gen. George Joulwan, the former top NATO
commander.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Cordesman, a senior military analyst at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies, pointed out that the
relatively long preparation time would allow more time for
Yugoslavia to continuing expelling or killing ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may now be too late in physical terms for a major ground
force option to save the refugees,'' said Cordesman.
</P>
<P>
   John Steinbruner, a foreign policy expert at the Brookings
Institution here, warned that a wide-scale invasion through Serbia
could spark intense fighting and destabilize the region.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbruner said such a large-scale invasion would be
``disastrous.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO would risk appearing to seek the overthrow of Milosevic, a
goal that Steinbruner asserted could divide the international
community, which currently is united behind the effort to halt the
ethnic cleansing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Protecting the population in Kosovo and establishing legal
order there is a legitimate purpose for a ground force, but
overthrowing Milosevic is not,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Serbia is the dominant republic in Yugoslavia. Kosovo is a
province of Serbia that is dominated by ethnic Albanians now under
siege from the Serbians. Two weeks of punishing NATO air raids have
failed to bring Milosevic to the peace table to sign a treaty with
the Albanian population in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   A second ground attack scenario, proposed by Joulwan, would
require around 30,000 troops and could be set in motion in less
time and would be focused on invading Kosovo to protect the ethnic
Albanian population.
</P>
<P>
   It would be spearheaded by the 14,000 NATO troops now stationed
in nearby Macedonia. They currently are training for entry into
Kosovo as part of a peace-keeping force in the aftermath of a
possible peace settlement. However, they are not outfitted with
sufficient numbers of heavy tanks and artillery needed to become an
offensive battle force.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a similar number of troops would invade Kosovo from
the west in Albania, according to the Joulwan plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the short term, we could mount an operation to restore the
territorial integrity of Kosovo, seal off and deny the Serb army
any access to Kosovo,'' said Joulwan.
</P>
<P>
   Joulwan called the option ``a much more prudent, quicker
option'' than a massive ground attack.
</P>
<P>
   The downside of the Joulwan plan is that it lacks the huge
three-to-one numerical superiority that military planners have long
favored in designing invasion forces to crush the opposition
quickly and keep U.S. casualties relatively low.
</P>
<P>
   With 40,000 Yugoslav troops in Kosovo, U.S. war planners likely
would seek a force of about 120,000 to 150,000 NATO troops,
according to retired Army Maj. Gen. Edward Atkeson, a senior fellow
at the Institute of Land Warfare in Arlington, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, an invasion from Macedonia and neighboring Albania
_ where NATO is stationing tank-killing Apache helicopters manned
by U.S. crews _ would face potential logistics logjams because of
poor road, rail and port systems, said Atkeson.
</P>
<P>
   Another potential downside of either option is the possible
repercussion for the ethnic Albanians, who have faced stepped up
attacks from Yugoslav forces since the air strikes began.
</P>
<P>
   ``If NATO has to slowly fight its way in, the ground options can
produce just as much killing (of ethnic Albanians) as the air
option,'' Cordesman said.
</P>
<P>
   While Secretary of State Albright reiterated Tuesday that there
were no plans to send U.S. ground troops into Kosovo, an offensive
force is gathering in the region. This includes:
</P>
<P>
   _ 14,000 NATO troops in Macedonia, including about 400 U.S. GIs.
The force is comprised mainly of light infantry but also includes
tanks and artillery.
</P>
<P>
   _ 2,200 U.S. Marines aboard ships in the Adriatic.
</P>
<P>
   _ a 1,200-member reinforced U.S. infantry battalion in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   _ 8,200 troops in Bosnia from the elite U.S. 1st Cavalry
Division, which has some heavy equipment such as tanks.
</P>
<P>
   _ 6,000 Italian ground troops in Albania or heading there.
</P>
<P>
   _ Two armored divisions in Germany, totalling about 24,000
troops. In addition, the United States could dispatch the 101st air
assault division and the 82nd airborne division, parts of which
could move quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Other NATO forces that could be tapped include 41,500 French
rapid reaction troops, 20,000 multi-national NATO rapid reaction
troops, the German 2nd Corps, which includes an armored division,
and five air mobile British battalions.

 &HT;    WITH SUSPECT ON THE LAM, DRUG CASE AGAINST MEXICAN GOVERNOR AN
EMBARRASSMENT

<P>
   MEXICO CITY -- Mexicans fear that one of the highest ranking
politicians to be implicated in drug trafficking will escape
justice.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Mario Villanueva's term as governor of Quintana Roo
state expired, and Tuesday evening -- after weeks of speculation --
a warrant was issued for his arrest. By that time, however,
Villanueva, had gone into hiding, as suggested by a letter his
lawyer delivered to Mexican newspapers Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Now a case that promised to become a spectacular victory for
Mexico's fight against corruption threatens to explode into a major
embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a case of international disrepute and a loss of
credibility nationally,'' Guillermo Velasco, president of the group
Mexicans United Against Delinquency, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   (optional trim follows)
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. congressional source familiar with Mexico's law
enforcement officials said: ``It's got to be embarrassing for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   (optional trim ends)
</P>
<P>
   The case against Villanueva symbolized ``hope that at last the
Mexican political system was beginning to fight impunity enjoyed by
governors and ex-governors involved in organized crime,'' said
Velasco.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement announcing the arrest warrant for Villanueva, the
attorney general's office in Mexico City said it could not detain
Villanueva sooner because he was constitutionally protected against
arrest while governor.
</P>
<P>
   The statement also said that the last confirmed sighting of
Villanueva was March 27, in the city of Merida, in Yucatan state.
</P>
<P>
   Some political observers suggest Villanueva was under
surveillance and said they find it hard to believe Mexican police
don't know where he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he did escape from their watch there should be another line
of investigation into whether it was negligence or complicity,''
said Raymundo Riva Palacio, a well-known Mexican political
columnist.
</P>
<P>
   Velasco said he's concerned that the hunt for Villanueva will
fade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember that there are thousands of arrest warrants issued
that are never carried out in Mexico,'' he said, ``and the only
explanation for that is that those who are supposed to carry them
out negotiate with criminals. We hope that this isn't happening in
this case.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter delivered to the news media by his lawyer,
Villanueva said he had left his ``turf'' to pursue his defense. The
letter does not make it clear if he is still in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Villanueva claims he is the victim of a political vendetta
because he is
</P>
<P>
   out of favor with dominant members of his party, Mexico's ruling
Revolutionary Institutional Party.
</P>
<P>
   Quintana Roo, the Caribbean coast state Villanueva governed for
six years, is home to Mexico's premiere tourist resort, Cancun.
</P>
<P>
   It has also become a haven for drug traffickers who smuggle as
much as 15 tons of cocaine a month into the United States,
according to law enforcement sources.
</P>
<P>
   Villanueva is accused of using his official airport hanger as a
transshipment point for cocaine.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A compact storm moving from Kansas into southern Iowa will cause
a variety of turbulent weather Thursday. Showers and gusty
thunderstorms will precede and accompany its fronts crossing the
Mississippi and lower Ohio Valleys. Conditions may be favorable for
a complex of severe storms in Missouri, southern Illinois and
Arkansas later in the day. These could spawn several tornadoes.
Gale force winds in the wake of the disturbance will raise clouds
of dust in Oklahoma and northwest Texas.
</P>
<P>
   A cold rain will drench sections of Nebraska and South Dakota
with wet snow possible in the Black Hills, but more likely across
the higher terrain of eastern Wyoming. Strong winds descending the
east slopes of the Rockies may cause damage in a few areas near the
Front Range as gusts surpass hurricane force.
</P>
<P>
   A thick plume of high clouds associated with a southern branch
of the jet stream will spread from east Texas across the Gulf
states. These clouds will dim the sun and keep afternoon
temperatures mainly below record high maximums.
</P>
<P>
   A weakening cool front in the Northeast will cause a few showers
in central and northern New England. Ahead of the front, it will be
very warm along the Northeast coast.
</P>
<P>
   An extraordinarily cold air mass will move southward along the
Pacific Coast into California. Snow levels will lower to near 1,000
feet in the northern coastal range. Showers may be mixed with sleet
in the Central Valley. Strong winds on the Coast will enhance the
unusual chill. The Southwest will turn dry and brighter.
</P>
<P>

   A thunderstorm with hail rumbled across parts of Los Angeles
Wednesday as a compact but potent jet stream disturbance arrived
from the Pacific. April thunderstorms affect Los Angeles only two
out of every five years, on average, but April hail is extremely
rare. By April, temperatures aloft have begun their climb toward
summer levels, limiting the possibility that any hail that might
form in a thunderstorm could survive to the ground. But very cold
air aloft was the signature of Wednesday's disturbance, a rarefied
chill that will help to spawn severe weather over the Middle West
on Wednesday.

<P>
   After NATO's air strikes against Yugoslavia, the Kosovo
Liberation Army is girding for a long guerilla war to win an
independent Kosovo now and a Greater Albania later. To Washington's
chagrin, the KLA rebels have supplanted Kosovo's moderate leaders
and won the support of most of its ethnic Albanians. The author,
who writes from inside the rebel group, says that Serbian brutality
has left the KLA bent on secession.

 &UR; By Garry Wills &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (1,600 words) As the world's only superpower, America is told
that it must act like ``a great nation,'' which still means
defending freedom around the world. That is a difficult enough task
for any nation. It is even more difficult for America, not only
because of its established Cold War pattern, but also because of
its longstanding tradition of holding aloof from global
partnerships.

   &UR; THE LONELY SUPERPOWER &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By SAMUEL P. HUNTINGTON &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   (1,300 words) American officials seem peculiarly blind to the
fact that often the more the United States attacks a foreign
leader, the more his popularity soars among countrymen who applaud
him for standing tall against the greatest power on earth. The
demonizing of leaders has so far failed to shorten their tenure in
power, from Fidel Castro (who has survived eight American
presidents) to Slobodan Milosevic to Saddam Hussein.

   (1,400 words) To report international news, the cost of a
journalistic caravan, including hotels, per diem expenses, car
rentals and local support staff, begins at about $3,000 a day.
Airfare and excess-baggage charges can easily reach $12,000. Then
there are ``extras'' such as satellite fees. New digital
technology, including smaller and lighter cameras and editing
equipment, will eventually reduce costs, but there is no indication
that the networks will use the savings to increase international
coverage.

<P>
   (1,500 words) There will always be ``trapped'' minorities, no
matter how carefully boundaries are drawn, except in the smallest
or most isolated environments. But when should secession be
supported by the international community? When massive human-rights
violations, approaching the scale of genocide, are being
perpetrated. Or when reasonable demands for minority rights have
been arbitrarily rejected by a central government.

<P>
   (2,000 words) The bloodshed in Kosovo is a symptom of the
approach, in the Dayton Accords of 1995, which strengthened
Slobodan Milosevic. In fact, Dayton plunged Serbia deeper into
ethnic chauvinism, whereby the ``sacred Serb soil'' of Kosovo
matters vastly more to Belgrade than do the Albanians who resided
there. As such, the Kosovo crisis comes as scant surprise.

</P>
<P>
   (1,500 words) The male appetite for battle has always been far
less voracious than either biologically inclined theorists of war
or army commanders might like. In traditional societies, warriors
often had to be taunted, intoxicated or ritually ``transformed''
into animal form before battle. Throughout Western history,
individual men have gone to near-suicidal lengths to avoid wars _
cutting off fingers or limbs or risking execution by deserting.

</P>
<P>
   (1,400 words) In the United States and other rich countries, a
pronounced gender gap with regard to foreign policy and national
security issues endures. American women have always been less
supportive than American men of U.S. involvement in war, including
World War II, Korea, Vietnam and the Persian Gulf War. They are
also consistently less supportive of defense spending and the use
of force abroad.

OUTRAGEOUS SHOW OF YOUNG BRITISH ARTISTS HEADS TO BROOKLYN MUSEUM
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By CAROL VOGEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Visitors to the Brooklyn Museum of Art this fall may
be in for a shock. Rather than sun-dappled Impressionist landscapes
or forthright Rodin bronzes, its classical galleries will be filled
with work by young British artists who have made a worldwide
reputation creating art that disturbs and outrages.
</P>
<P>
   Prominently featured will be Damien Hirst's infamous dead shark
floating in a tank of formaldehyde, Marc Quinn's cast of a man's
head made of his own frozen blood and Ron Mueck's sculpture of his
naked, dead father, reduced to the length of three feet.
</P>
<P>
   These works are part of ``Sensation: Young British Artists from
the Saatchi Collection,'' a show that drew record crowds and a
hailstorm of praise and criticism when it opened in late 1997 at
the staid Royal Academy of Arts in London.
</P>
<P>
   The show drew extreme reactions from both viewers and critics.
Those who liked it said it captured the excitement and innovative
talents of British art today. Those who damned the show felt its
content was offensive, intended to shock for shock's sake, or just
plain bad. Some pointed out that the show also served to increase
the value of Saatchi's collection.
</P>
<P>
   The most extreme reaction was to the artist Marcus Harvey's
depiction of Myra Hindley, who was convicted in the macabre ``moors
murders'' of children in western England in the 1960s. Protesters
splattered ink and raw eggs on the painting, saying that it
trivialized her victims' suffering and glorified her crimes.
</P>
<P>
   After London, the show traveled to the Hamburger Bahnhof in
Berlin where it was just as popular.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is truly a defining exhibition,'' said Arnold L. Lehman,
director of the Brooklyn Museum. ``Rarely can you get enough works
to accurately capture the spirit of what's happening at a specific
moment in time. Museums, especially New York museums, ought to
bring to their audiences the art happening today from all parts of
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sensation'' will be the largest exhibition in the museum's
102-year history, occupying more than 20,000 square feet of gallery
space. Among the other artists whose works will be on view are Mona
Hatoum, Sarah Lucas, Chris Ofili, Fiona Rae and Rachel Whiteread.
</P>
<P>
   All are well known figures in London, and most have been shown
internationally, exploring themes like sexual identity, feminism
and social criticism.
</P>
<P>
   The collection belongs to Charles Saatchi, the advertising
magnate who is London's most important contemporary art collector
and one of the earliest and most passionate supporters of these
artists, who are often referred to as YBA's (Young British
Artists).
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 90 works in ``Sensation'' were bought during the
1990s. They constitute little more than a sampling of his
collection of 20th-century art, which totals about 1,500 works.
</P>
<P>
   He was among the first collectors to buy these artists' works
and to show them publicly; he owns an exhibition space on Boundary
Road in London's St. John's Wood. (Some art critics who saw the
show in London said they felt it gave too much weight to the taste
of one collector.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Sensation,'' which will run from Oct. 2 through Jan. 9, has
been in the planning stages for well over a year. The size of some
of the works and the complexity of their installation has made it a
logistical and economic nightmare for the museum, with financing
being the biggest problem, museum officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The provocative nature of the work is generally thought to be
too daring for corporate sponsors and has made it difficult to
raise the $1 million necessary to mount the show.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Lehman said, a number of individuals have agreed to
contribute to the show, as has Christie's, the auction house, which
was a supporter of the Royal Academy's show. The museum is still
looking for other sponsors but would not say how much had been
raised so far.
</P>
<P>
   The show's installation will be unusually tricky, not to mention
expensive. In order to comply with New York City health and
environmental ordinances, for instance, dead animals have to be
hermetically sealed in cases of steel and glass with tubes
connected to carbon filters eliminating the smell of decay. ``Our
conservation department has been in discussions with people who
have been involved in installing these objects and are aware of
every aspect that must be dealt with,'' Lehman said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he thinks the show will cause as much of a stir as it
did in London, he added, ``I think New Yorkers are incredibly
sophisticated and believe like I do that they should be exposed to
works that are both emotionally engaging and ones that make us
think.''
</P>
<P>
   The show is likely to bring a kind of audience to the museum
that it wants to attract: young, hip people who tend to frequent
its neighbor, the Brooklyn Academy of Music.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this show is important for people of every age,'' said
Lehman. ``Brooklyn is becoming a center for contemporary art. We
have something like 4,000 artists living here. It's terrific for
them to see what their colleagues have been doing across the
Atlantic.''

 &HT;    Year 2000 radio contests to reward metro couple having 1st child
of year
 &HT;    By Diane Lore
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If you want to make a Y2K baby, now's the time.
</P>
<P>
   So light the candles, disconnect the phone and dance with
destiny on Friday and Saturday nights _ considered the optimum time
to conceive a baby slated to be born on Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're psyched,'' said Carolyn Reed, 30, who is hoping to hit
the target. ``Not many people get to witness the turn of the
century. And to have a chance to have a baby right as it starts is
very, very exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   She and her husband, Christopher, aren't the only ones with love
on their minds.
</P>
<P>
   Six couples will be marking their calendars _ and spending time
in Atlanta hotels this weekend _ as part of radio promotions at
Hot-97.5 WHTA-FM and WSB-FM, or B98.5, to create next year's first
baby.
</P>
<P>
   Tiffany and Taurus Maddox of Decatur (Ga.) already have two
children. But this weekend, they will be one of three couples
trying for another child as part of the contest held by Hot-97.5.
Out of 30 couples who wanted to participate, the three were
selected by an obstetrician on the basis of the women's cycles,
ages and history of childbearing, according to Twana James, co-host
of WHTA's morning show.
</P>
<P>
   Tiffany Maddox said they decided to enter the contest because
they had planned to have another baby anyway, and she had hoped to
have it before a spring wedding for a relative next year. ``I
thought I need to get this out of the way. And then I started
thinking it would be really great to aim for Jan. 1, 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors say, however, anything to do with the birds and the bees
is a fickle business.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the mood is right and the body is willing, less than 10
percent of the world's women of childbearing years will actually be
ovulating this weekend. And if ``you're one of the lucky women
ovulating, then you've still got to have a cooperative egg and
plenty of sperm,'' said Dr. Michael Randell, an obstetrician and
gynecologist who practices at Northside Hospital (Atlanta).
</P>
<P>
   In fact, couples only have a 25 percent to 30 percent chance of
conceiving, even if the timing is right.
</P>
<P>
   Of those who become pregnant, up to a third miscarry, doctors
say. And finally, actually hitting the date set by doctors is a
little lik winning the lottery _ only 5 percent of women actually
go into labor and give birth on their due date.
</P>
<P>
   Now, some couples might try to stack the odds by trying to
schedule their C-section on Jan. 1, but most doctors say they won't
allow it because they are more concerned about the health of the
baby than a celebration of 2000. (And Jan. 1 falls on a Saturday _
not during normal office hours.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't schedule an elective C-section just because of the
new year,'' said Dr. Stephen Blank, an obstetrician and the former
chairman of Northside Hospital's obstetrics and gynecology
department. ``And to be honest, at Northside, they're so busy
anyway, it would put an unnecessary burden on the system.''
</P>
<P>
   Northside, the region's largest baby-birthing facility, already
experiences between 30 and 50 deliveries a day, he said. ``And if
the load increases by one or two times, there's no way they're
going to be able to satisfy any more requests.''
</P>
<P>
   Couples sometimes ask to hurry along a C-section at the end of a
year so they're guaranteed a tax break, doctors say. ``So asking
for a Jan. 1 C-section would be sort of a novelty,'' Blank said.
</P>
<P>
   So let's say lots of couples succeed at creating the first batch
of Y2K babies. What might these kids be like?
</P>
<P>
   A child born right after the stroke of midnight would be a
Capricorn _ serious and tenacious, with good concentration and the
capacity to work long and hard, according to Kathryn L. Silverton,
an astrologer who also holds a master's degree in psychology. But
because the moon will be in Scorpio, the child will also be
emotionally intense, according to Carol Garlick, who writes a
column with Silverton in Aquarius, an Atlanta New Age magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe. But one thing is true: Y2K babies will face a
remarkably changing world. And _ with advances in medicine _ they
also have a good chance of seeing Jan. 1, 2100, doctors say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just think how much has happened since the last turn of the
century,'' said Reed. ``We can only imagine what a baby born on
Jan. 1, 2000, will experience. But it's very exciting to think
about.''

JOY OF E-MAIL LIGHTS UP THE LIFE OF A RETARDED TEEN-AGER

 By DEBRA NUSSBAUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   My 15-year-old son charges down the back stairway and into the
kitchen with an entrance reminiscent of Kramer entering Jerry
Seinfeld's apartment. ``We have to check my e-mail,'' he announces.
``Jenn is sending me an e-mail.''
</P>
<P>
   Several months ago we would never have heard this coming from
Zachary. While his siblings discovered e-mail long ago, it has just
become a factor in his teen-aged world. The joy of hearing ``you've
got mail'' is a new phenomenon to him.
</P>
<P>
   My son Zachary Bissinger is mildly mentally retarded and reads
and writes at about a second-grade level. He and his twin brother,
Gerry, each weighed less than two pounds when they were born in
1983. But because Gerry's lungs were developed, he was a fairly
healthy baby and is a typical, normal teen-ager (as normal as
teen-agers can be). Zach's lungs were not as well formed and he
spent seven months in Philadelphia's Pennsylvania Hospital, hooked
up to a world of modern medical technology.
</P>
<P>
   He came home from the hospital at 7 months old and by the time
he was 3, he was found to be mildly retarded. His IQ is in the 70s.
While he is very friendly and has a good vocabulary, his biggest
struggle these days is with regular social conversation. He's great
at firing questions (he could be the next Sam Donaldson), but he
has trouble forming answers to questions asked of him.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Zach _ who loves maps _ can give you
directions from just about anywhere in New Jersey to any street in
Philadelphia. He can tell you the day of the week your birthday is
on this year if you give him the date. He remembers street
addresses from 10 years ago, but it's hard for him to remember to
shave every day.
</P>
<P>
   While Zach loves Nintendo games, we could never seem to get him
interested in the computer. He has a computer in our home and two
at his dad's house, but even with the colorful games and enticing
software, Zach didn't have any interest.
</P>
<P>
   But Zach is interested in developing his social life. As a
student at Haddonfield (N.J.) Memorial High School, in the school's
special-education program on living skills, Zach and his half-dozen
school friends spend much of the day learning basic skills that
will help them get jobs. They take several classes, like gym or
nutrition, with the other high school students. Even though they
don't go to the high school dances and won't go to the prom (by
their own choice), they want to socialize and fit in.
</P>
<P>
   Zach's friends, many with Down's syndrome, listen to the
Backstreet Boys, love Leonardo DiCaprio and watch ``Dawson's
Creek.'' Zach is less hip than his classmates, but they are
bringing him into the world of pop music enough that he buys the
occasional CD.
</P>
<P>
   Most of their socializing is with one another. They go to dances
and theater rehearsals through a local organization called Hometown
Opportunities for the Mentally Handicap, which was started in the
1980s by several parents who wanted disabled young adults to have
continuing education. Ted Sery, who runs Homh (pronounced Home),
has a 31-year-old daughter who is disabled. He is active in the
group because he did not want her education and socialization to
stop at the age of 21, when school ends for many disabled people.
</P>
<P>
   When the notice came home for the Homh computer class at
Haddonfield High School's night-school program, I decided to sign
Zach up.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Zach had tried a regular high school keyboarding
class. While he and the teacher, Karen Rauba, got along famously,
the class was too much for him. With 19 other students in the
class, he found it hard to focus on the keyboard and the monitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was more of an attention problem'' than a skill problem,
Mrs. Rauba said. After a few weeks, we moved him out of the class.
</P>
<P>
   When I signed Zach up for the evening Homh class, I wondered if
a kid who had benefited so much from technology early in his life
could ever master some technology to use in his life now.
</P>
<P>
   The first few classes were the basics _ turning on the computer,
getting a log-on name and a password. The teacher, Christine
Costantino, encouraged the 13 students, who ranged in age from 14
to 40, to pick their favorite food as their password because it's
easy to remember.
</P>
<P>
   The students sat in front of the lab's Gateway computers _ each
participant was helped by a high school student _ and got a chance
to research a favorite animal. By the second class, a mother
suggested that her daughter would much rather research the
Backstreet Boys than tigers. The printer was very busy that night
with shots of the Backstreet Boys in various poses.
</P>
<P>
   Students from the high school's National Honor Society sat among
the students and encouraged them to send e-mail to one another and
to them. Zach lit up when a senior, Jenn Leonard, leaned over his
computer and said, ``Send me an e-mail, and I'll write back to
you.''
</P>
<P>
   The students, including Zach, all needed prompting from the
helpers, but they loved going to the printer and getting pictures
and just talking to the other kids. Most had no trouble maneuvering
the mouse, and no one got frustrated enough to quit before the hour
was up.
</P>
<P>
   Each student was given an address at Hotmail, the free Web-based
e-mail provider. Each e-mail address was handed out on a piece of
paper so the student could share it with friends and family and use
it to check e-mail at the class' next session.
</P>
<P>
   The students started out by doing an Internet search for a music
group. Zach typed with one finger but wanted to do it himself. Adam
Karpman, a high school junior, helped him navigate the Web. Zach's
friend Laura Klein, who is in his living-skills class, brought her
Backstreet Boys CD to class. Her mother, Joy, said that Laura had
seen ``www'' on the back and figured out that it meant she could
see the group's Web site on the computer while she played the CD.
The girls cheered when the music came out of the computer.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to classes in public schools and programs sponsored by
community organizations, it's rare to find a disabled child or
teen-ager who hasn't logged onto a computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every child with a special need will be involved with
computers one way or another,'' said Bridget Lyne, managing editor
of Exceptional Parent magazine (www.eparent.com). ``The learning
possibilities, I couldn't even begin to quantify.''
</P>
<P>
   The magazine, published since 1971 as a guide for parents of
children or young adults with disabilities or health problems, has
increased its focus on technology in the past few years. A
four-part series that started in November and covered learning
software and adaptive devices can be ordered from the magazine at
(800) 372-7368.
</P>
<P>
   The Exceptional Parent 1999 Resource Guide, which is published
every January and is available in bookstores or through the
magazine for $12, also lists technology resources. Ms. Lyne
recommends checking with local public schools or night-school
programs to see if they offer technology classes.
</P>
<P>
   Goodwill Industries International (www.goodwill.org) offers
computer training and job-skills classes at about 100 offices in
the United States, said Christine Nyirjesy Bragale, a Goodwill
spokeswoman. The classes vary in price. To find the closest local
office, call (800) 664-6577.
</P>
<P>
   The Alliance for Technology Access (www.ATAccess.org), a
nonprofit group that began 11 years ago as a consumer-driven
technology and resource center, now has 40 offices across the
country. It offers information about software and other assistive
technology, and consumers can try out the equipment at its centers.

<P>
   Brushes are important tools in any kit. Inexperienced
do-it-yourselfers tend to think that all brushes are alike. This
might seem like a logical assumption, considering that all brushes
are made up of only three components: the fibers or filling, the
handle and the ferrule.
</P>
<P>
   There are, however, significant differences in the materials
used to make these components, and they can affect quality,
performance and price. Consider the filling, for example. It is
made up of filaments bonded together, or set. Most brush fillings
are bonded with vulcanized rubber. This makes them impervious to
volatile spirits used to thin paints and clean brushes.
</P>
<P>
   Other types of brushes, washing-down brushes or paste brushes,
usually have fillings bonded together with pitch or natural resins.
Solvents will dissolve these bonding agents so the brushes can only
be used with water.
</P>
<P>
   There are a variety of different filaments used to make the
fillings. Natural fibers include bristle, horsehair, sable, ox
hair, badger hair and fiber. While most people refer to the brush
filaments as bristles, this term should be used only for brush
filaments obtained from the pelt of a boar.
</P>
<P>
   Individual boar bristles are slightly tapered with naturally
split ends commonly called flags. The flagged ends of bristles
enable them to hold more paint than other types of filaments. In
addition, bristles are very resilient so they spring back when
flexed. These qualities make natural-bristle brushes an ideal
choice for jobs with oil-based paints. They are not good for
applying water-based paints because the water in the paint swells
the bristles and distorts their shape, making it difficult to get a
smooth, even coating of latex paint.
</P>
<P>
   Horsehair is a relatively cheap filament that comes from the
mane and tail of a horse. It has neither the flagged tip nor the
resilience of bristle, so it is not used exclusively in fillings.
Instead, it is added to provide bulk and body to natural-filament
brush fillings. Ox hair is similar in quality to horsehair. It is
used to make small brushes for craft jobs, graining and sign
writing.
</P>
<P>
   Badger hair filaments are easily recognized by the color
gradation from white to black. These are fine-quality filaments
with natural resiliency and flagged tips. They are more
water-resistant than boar bristles, so they can be used with
water-based paints.
</P>
<P>
   Sable filaments come from mink, weasel or squirrel. They are
available in short lengths, so sable brushes are round, small and
suitable only for detail work and graining. Some manufacturers
offer flat sable brushes two or four inches wide. They are used
primarily by furniture refinishers for brushing on natural varnish.
</P>
<P>
   Boar bristle, horsehair, ox hair, badger hair, and sable are
natural filaments obtained from animals. Another natural filament
is fiber. It is a cheap, tough filament obtained from the stalk of
a palm tree. Fiber is rather coarse so it can be used only in
brushes designed for applying paste, whitewash, or in scrub
brushes.
</P>
<P>
   Many brushes manufactured today have fillings made up of
synthetic filaments -- usually of nylon, although other materials
are sometimes used. Modern synthetic filaments have the same taper,
resiliency and flagged tip of bristle filaments. They are durable,
hold paint well, and are usually more economical than natural
filament.
</P>
<P>
   When purchasing any brush, tug the filling gently to make sure
the filaments are firmly bound to the stock. Fan the filling
between your thumb and fingers. The filaments should spread easily,
then spring back into place. Test the resiliency of the filling by
stroking it against a surface, as if you were applying paint. The
filling should flex without losing filaments.
</P>
<P>
   Most brush handles are made of one piece of wood or molded
plastic. The base of the handle, the wide part that mates with the
filling, is called the stock. A few specialty brushes have a
separate turned handle that fits into a hole in the stock. This
handle configuration, sometimes called the Dutchpattern, is used
with round, faux-finishing and decorating brushes. Good-quality
brushes have smooth handles shaped to fit the hand and offer a good
grip.
</P>
<P>
   The handle and filling are joined by a band of metal called the
ferrule. The ferrule is secured to the handle with small nails or
rivets. When inspecting a new brush, make sure that the ferrule is
firmly attached to the handle.
</P>
<P>
   If a good brush is properly cared for, it will last a lifetime.
After using any brush, be sure to clean it thoroughly in the proper
solvent to dissolve all traces of paint or varnish from the
filling. Afterward, wash the brush in warm, soapy water to remove
the solvent. Shake out the excess water, then dry the filaments
with a towel.

SPORTS COLUMN: A NEW GOLF RIVALRY IN THE MAKING? NOT SO QUICK!
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By DAVID CARAVIELLO   
 The Herald-Journal, Spartanburg, S.C.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ It has been nearly 30 years since Arnold Palmer
has been competitive at the highest level of professional golf, and
over a decade since Jack Nicklaus last won a PGA Tour event. Yet
the rivalry between them remains the most storied of the sport's
modern era, and has left golf yearning for another to pick up where
it left off.
</P>
<P>
   Golf fans and golf media dearly want to see another
Nicklaus-Palmer type of rivalry unfold where two players rise above
an anonymous pack and battle against each other as much as the rest
of the field. Many believe the beginnings of golf's next great
rivalry will be found among the dogwoods and azaleas of the 63rd
Masters, which begins Thursday at Augusta National Golf Club.
</P>
<P>
   David Duval enters the tournament ranked No. 1 in the world. He
is on a hot streak that has seen him win four times this season and
11 times in his last 34 tournaments. Behind him is world No. 2
Tiger Woods, who has won once in the last year but becomes the man
to beat at Augusta National the minute he steps out of his courtesy
car.
</P>
<P>
   Duval and Woods are comparable in age (27 and 23, respectively),
experience (six and four years) and professional victories (11 and
10). Duval has his wraparound mirror sunglasses, Woods his menacing
stare. They are both young, photogenic, talented and marketable.
They are two stars rising at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   All are reasons why they cannot provide the kind of
Palmer-Nicklaus rivalry everyone in golf craves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think those two players will be the best for two players for
a long time,'' said Fred Couples, last year's runner-up. ``But
Arnold Palmer and Jack Nicklaus, that's a one-time thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus burst onto the scene in 1962, by which time Palmer had
already been playing professionally for seven years. Palmer was
golf's most dominant and beloved player, having won three majors
before Nicklaus arrived.
</P>
<P>
   The rivalry began when the chunky kid from Ohio knocked the king
off his pedestal in the 1962 U.S. Open Championship, and evolved to
an epic level as the two battled in nearly every major tournament
over the next 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   Woods and Duval, by contrast, are contemporaries. They have one
major title between them, Woods' victory in the 1997 Masters. Over
the decade that saw their most heated competition, Nicklaus and
Palmer combined for 14.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the reason why Arnold and I became a rivalry was
because Arnold was winning most of the major championships at that
time,'' said Nicklaus, who will miss his first Masters since 1958
because of recent hip replacement surgery. When the tournament tees
off, he'll be fishing in the Bahamas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I can't really see that there's a rivalry yet,'' Nicklaus
said. ``One fella has won one major championship, and the other
hasn't won any. That doesn't mean they aren't the two best players,
I think they are. If you want to create a rivalry, wait until one
of them wins the Masters and the next one wins the U.S. Open. Then
you've got a rivalry.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, it's tough to be rivals when you hardly ever play in
the same tournaments. Of the four events Duval has won this season,
Woods competed in one, the Players Championship. And Duval didn't
play in the Buick Invitational, the tournament Woods won this year.
</P>
<P>
   Another key factor to consider is that Woods and Duval are only
two members of a cluttered class of 20-somethings that has made the
PGA Tour deeper and more competitive than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen months ago, Duval was a perennial bridesmaid who
couldn't finish off a final round. One year ago, Justin Leonard and
Woods were supposed to be the next Palmer and Nicklaus. Two years
ago, it was Phil Mickelson and Ernie Els. The Tour has proven too
difficult for any one of them to break free of the pack, much less
two.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd certainly embrace it if it came to pass, but I think it's
hard to say that we have a rivalry right now,'' Duval said. He said
Ernie Els, Phil Mickelson and Justin Leonard also must be
considered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there a little bit of a rivalry between Tiger and David?
Yeah, probably,'' said defending Masters champion Mark O'Meara.
``But I also believe there are other fine players we cannot
overlook. And if you get so wound up in those two guys, these other
guys are going to take it.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the elements that will always set the Palmer-Nicklaus
rivalry apart is the way it began, with Nicklaus beating Palmer in
a playoff in the 1962 U.S. Open at Oakmont Country Club, in western
Pennsylvania near Palmer's hometown of Latrobe. Woods-Duval, if it
is to ever become a rivalry to begin with, needs such a defining
moment.
</P>
<P>
   That moment could come Sunday in the late afternoon, when both
players are expected to be near the top of the Masters leader
board. But, Nicklaus said, it needs to happen on its own. What
passes as a rivalry now between Woods and Duval seems almost
manufactured, a product of wishes by fans and stories by the media.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our games created the rivalry,'' Nicklaus said of he and
Palmer. ``The rivalry was not created by the media. I think that's
what has to happen with these guys. Their games have got to create
that.''

`WILL &AMP; GRACE' MAKES HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
WILL &AMP; GRACE 
Starring: Eric McCormack, Debra Messing, Sean Hayes, Megan
Mullally 
On: NBC, Thursday night at 8:30 
Rated: TVPG 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A small bit of television history will occur when ``Will &AMP;
Grace'' moves on up to Thursday nights at 8:30. No, it's not
because NBC has finally made a sensible decision by banishing
``Jesse'' to the mysterious land of Early Hiatus, where mediocre
shows go to find spiritual peace before, hopefully, dying.
</P>
<P>
   The historical moment has more to do with the fact that, with
hardly a rah-rah or a boo-hoo from gay and right-wing factions, a
sitcom about a gay man and his friends will finally take up
residence in TV's hottest neighborhood. Willfully, but gracefully,
``Will &AMP; Grace'' has inched its way from the Nowheresville of
Mondays and the Promised Land of Tuesdays to the heights of
Thursday nights, in the Nielsen-topping block that reaches from
``Friends'' to ``ER.'' It will continue to be the gayest show on
TV, and because it's on Thursdays, and because it's on NBC, and
because America finds it hard to reach for the clicker between good
shows, it will be among the most watched TV series in America every
week.
</P>
<P>
   Let's hope ``Will &AMP; Grace'' keeps its head. It's quite possible
that this move into high visibility will blow up the sort of dust
storm of controversy that plagued ``Ellen,'' but that has not hit
``Will &AMP; Grace'' so far. The ``pro-family'' folks who have been
fighting for an HC TV rating _ for ``Homosexual Content'' _ and all
the Falwell followers will probably turn up the volume on their
anti-gay lobbying and get their fax machines a-churning. And the
gay organizations that find the show's image of gay life too
``safe'' will accuse the writers of de-sexualizing the characters
to make them palatable for the homophobic public. When, they will
ask, will we see Will Truman kiss another man? When will he have
all the rights of the straight members of the sitcom community?
</P>
<P>
   Once ``Ellen'' caught the eyes of the world in 1997, it made a
wrong move by trying to force an understanding of gay life onto
viewers. After a few hysterical episodes about coming out and the
awkward moments between straights and gays, ``Ellen'' sacrificed
its good humor to educate the masses _ forgetting that few of us
turn on sitcoms to get a PhD in social issues. The show overlooked
the great subversive powers of comedy, tearing the velvet off the
pink hammer before bringing it down upon viewers' heads.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, ``Will &AMP; Grace'' is first and foremost a comedy, with
no agenda other than to cause laughter. With first-rate repartee
that is jam-packed with hip allusions, its sensibility makes me
think of Sandra Bernhard, the comic whose monologues and songs are
meaningless without a good knowledge of pop culture and an ear for
camp. This episode includes bits about Petula Clark, Tinky Winky
from ``Teletubbies,'' ``Dead Man Walking,'' the James Brolin-Barbra
Streisand marriage, Sal Mineo, Soon Yi Allen, and the song ``I
Fought the Law,'' among other icons large and tiny. The show is
very New York, very up-to-date, and very Entertainment Weekly.
</P>
<P>
   But all the cleverness would be nothing, of course, without a
strong cast of characters. The four ``Will &AMP; Grace'' regulars are
in the process of developing the kind of rich ensemble dynamic that
marks the very best sitcoms. Roommates Will and Grace are happily,
and miserably, codependent, both single and wishing for but fearing
love affairs. During the course of the season, actors Eric
McCormack and Debra Messing have been refining their chemistry,
with McCormack letting Will be more temperamental and needy, and
Messing making Grace less high strung and ``I Love Lucy''-esque.
Initially, the scripts portrayed Grace as the more pathetic of the
pair, still harboring hopes for a man who has his eye on other men.
But more recently Will has been seen moping over Grace's
independence and romantic involvement, notably a dalliance with
Will's brother. Now, the two characters are equally screwed up.
</P>
<P>
   The ensemble gains its brio from the more cartoonish supporting
turns by Sean Hayes as Jack, Will's queeny friend, and Megan
Mullally as Karen, Grace's mink-wearing assistant. Hayes brings a
winning physical comedy to Jack's barbs, swishes, and one-liners
(``Welcome to Cynical Island. Population: You''), and Mullally
takes Karen's unapologetic superficiality and indolence to
delightful new depths. Gradually, the writers have let the two
expand their unique rapport, which is bound up in sexual
attraction, cattiness, fabulousness, and an inexplicable enthusiasm
for rubbing bellies together. Also, Karen has been cultivating an
amusing dislike for Will, and Jack has been in and out of a dislike
for Grace, both of which give the group some needed quadrangular
tension.
</P>
<P>
   Along with external pressure to be more gay or less gay, ``Will
&AMP; Grace'' will now face internal pressure to dumb down its humor to
appeal to the broader Thursday night audience. ``Frasier''
succumbed to the same pressure when it replaced ``Seinfeld'' last
fall, with the writers jettisoning the sophistication that made
their show a hit in the first place. (Recently, ``Frasier'' has
recovered some of its former drollness.)
</P>
<P>
   Let's hope this ``Will &AMP; Grace'' is not a harbinger of a new
Thursday night modus. The laugh track seems a little louder, the
characters are slightly broader, and the plot devolves into the
kind of shenanigans that we generally find respite from on shows
like ``Will &AMP; Grace.'' The episode has Will becoming soulmates with
a new female friend, now that Grace is caught up in her work.
(Molly Shannon, from ``Saturday Night Live,'' is appealing as the
Grace replacement, and NBC may well be testing her out for a future
sitcom.) By the end of the half hour, Grace's insane jealousy turns
violent, and the show resorts to the sort of catfighting gimmick
that ``Dynasty'' was famous for. Not a series high point.
</P>
<P>
   If everyone can let ``Will &AMP; Grace'' be ``Will &AMP; Grace,'' NBC
will have a Thursday night troika of top-notch comedies on its
hands. Those who feel the need to futz with a sitcom should turn
their creative attentions to ``Veronica's Closet,'' the abominable
9:30 show that coasts into the Top 10 on its neighbors' ballast.
Now there's one closet that never should have been opened up.

 &HT;    Year 2000 radio contests to reward metro couple having 1st child
of year
 &HT;    By Diane Lore
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If you want to make a Y2K baby, now's the time.
</P>
<P>
   So light the candles, disconnect the phone and dance with
destiny on Friday and Saturday nights _ considered the optimum time
to conceive a baby slated to be born on Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're psyched,'' said Carolyn Reed, 30, who is hoping to hit
the target. ``Not many people get to witness the turn of the
century. And to have a chance to have a baby right as it starts is
very, very exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   She and her husband, Christopher, aren't the only ones with love
on their minds.
</P>
<P>
   Six couples will be marking their calendars _ and spending time
in Atlanta hotels this weekend _ as part of radio promotions at
Hot-97.5 WHTA-FM and WSB-FM, or B98.5, to create next year's first
baby.
</P>
<P>
   Tiffany and Taurus Maddox of Decatur (Ga.) already have two
children. But this weekend, they will be one of three couples
trying for another child as part of the contest held by Hot-97.5.
Out of 30 couples who wanted to participate, the three were
selected by an obstetrician on the basis of the women's cycles,
ages and history of childbearing, according to Twana James, co-host
of WHTA's morning show.
</P>
<P>
   Tiffany Maddox said they decided to enter the contest because
they had planned to have another baby anyway, and she had hoped to
have it before a spring wedding for a relative next year. ``I
thought I need to get this out of the way. And then I started
thinking it would be really great to aim for Jan. 1, 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors say, however, anything to do with the birds and the bees
is a fickle business.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the mood is right and the body is willing, less than 10
percent of the world's women of childbearing years will actually be
ovulating this weekend. And if ``you're one of the lucky women
ovulating, then you've still got to have a cooperative egg and
plenty of sperm,'' said Dr. Michael Randell, an obstetrician and
gynecologist who practices at Northside Hospital (Atlanta).
</P>
<P>
   In fact, couples only have a 25 percent to 30 percent chance of
conceiving, even if the timing is right.
</P>
<P>
   Of those who become pregnant, up to a third miscarry, doctors
say. And finally, actually hitting the date set by doctors is a
little like winning the lottery _ only 5 percent of women actually
go into labor and give birth on their due date.
</P>
<P>
   Now, some couples might try to stack the odds by trying to
schedule their C-section on Jan. 1, but most doctors say they won't
allow it because they are more concerned about the health of the
baby than a celebration of 2000. (And Jan. 1 falls on a Saturday _
not during normal office hours.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't schedule an elective C-section just because of the
new year,'' said Dr. Stephen Blank, an obstetrician and the former
chairman of Northside Hospital's obstetrics and gynecology
department. ``And to be honest, at Northside, they're so busy
anyway, it would put an unnecessary burden on the system.''
</P>
<P>
   Northside, the region's largest baby-birthing facility, already
experiences between 30 and 50 deliveries a day, he said. ``And if
the load increases by one or two times, there's no way they're
going to be able to satisfy any more requests.''
</P>
<P>
   Couples sometimes ask to hurry along a C-section at the end of a
year so they're guaranteed a tax break, doctors say. ``So asking
for a Jan. 1 C-section would be sort of a novelty,'' Blank said.
</P>
<P>
   So let's say lots of couples succeed at creating the first batch
of Y2K babies. What might these kids be like?
</P>
<P>
   A child born right after the stroke of midnight would be a
Capricorn _ serious and tenacious, with good concentration and the
capacity to work long and hard, according to Kathryn L. Silverton,
an astrologer who also holds a master's degree in psychology. But
because the moon will be in Scorpio, the child will also be
emotionally intense, according to Carol Garlick, who writes a
column with Silverton in Aquarius, an Atlanta New Age magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe. But one thing is true: Y2K babies will face a
remarkably changing world. And _ with advances in medicine _ they
also have a good chance of seeing Jan. 1, 2100, doctors say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just think how much has happened since the last turn of the
century,'' said Reed. ``We can only imagine what a baby born on
Jan. 1, 2000, will experience. But it's very exciting to think
about.''

SUNDAY DRIVER ON THE INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LAURI NOTARO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - ``I need your Internet address,'' she announced when
she called me. ``Want to be my cyberpal?''
</P>
<P>
   A sudden chill cut through me straight to the bone.
</P>
<P>
   With my mom? On the Information Superhighway? My mom, using
electronic technology? Are apes running the world, too?
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, she was fascinated one day by a new, bright red
light that kept flashing in her kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think your father bought this for me as a surprise,'' she
whispered as she showed it to me. ``Can you believe they make
microwaves this small now?''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's your answering machine, Mom,'' I said. ``And that
message must be important, because you've programmed that thing to
let the phone ring 46 times before it picks up. Wanna hear it?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nah,'' she said, ``If it's really important, they'll call
back.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh,'' I said, ``I bet it's the phone call I made to you when
someone was trying to break into my house in 1995. You should
listen to it, it's a good one. I cry on it and everything.''
</P>
<P>
   She also has call waiting that is nothing but a wicked myth on
her cordless phone.
</P>
<P>
   She bought a VCR that requires a drum roll, an ancient chant and
a sprinkle of fairy dust just to turn on.
</P>
<P>
   And now she was playing with e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mom,'' I said as gently as I could, ``the most technical thing
you've ever done was give your credit card number to a QVC operator
over the phone, and that's only if call waiting doesn't beep in.
You can't even control the appliances you have now. Figure out how
to work the camcorder first and then we'll move on to e-mail.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can do this,'' she asserted. ``I'm going to get `The
Complete Internet Book for Dummies.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, while you're at the bookstore,'' I added, ``pick up `The
Total Internet Guide for Idiots,' `The Absolute Internet Guide for
Jackasses' and `The Entire Internet Book of the Dead' . That should
do you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't get fresh,'' she warned me.
</P>
<P>
   A day later, I got an e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi Laurie,'' it said. ``It's Mom. I bet you didn't think I
could send you an e-mail. I'm not real crazy about QVC online, I'd
rather watch it on TV. Don't forget to e-mail me. From, Mom.''
</P>
<P>
   Two hours after that, I got a phone call.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you mad at me?'' my mother asked. ``Why haven't you
e-mailed me back? I've been waiting!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have anything to say,'' I confessed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then say that!'' she said, her voice rising. ``I love it when
the machine says, `You have mail.' It makes me feel like Meg
Ryan!''
</P>
<P>
   I felt a dark precedent coming on. I could see my mom using the
Internet to do all of her Mom's Dirty Work, because in my mom's
e-mail world, I was mute. It was her dream, a dangerous, magical
dream. I quickly imagined being barraged by her e-mail messages,
saying things to me without the potential for me to talk back to
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi Laurie. It's Mom. Clean your filthy house. From, Mom.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi Laurie. It's Mom. Go to church or go to hell. You choose.
From, Mom.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi Laurie. It's Mom. Shave your monkey armpits or you're going
to find yourself single again. From, Mom.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi Laurie. It's Mom. Why don't you answer my e-mails? From,
Mom.''
</P>
<P>
   E-mail, however, wasn't the only Internet frontier my mother
wanted to conquer. After watching the Rosie O'Donnell show, she
called me again.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's eBay on the Internet?'' she wanted to know. ``Is it
ebonics for something dirty, because I don't understand it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember the Internet auction I got addicted to last year?'' I
asked her. ``That's eBay.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to do the eBay,'' she said sternly. ``Rosie does
something on it for charity. I want to help. As long as it's not
pornographic or a perverted chat room. I don't want anyone putting
my head on a naked body like they did to Sophia Loren. I don't get
my kicks that way. Will you come over and help me do the eBay?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Only if you show me the naked picture of Sophia Loren,'' I
replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't get fresh,'' she warned.
</P>
<P>
   So I went over to help her and logged onto the site to register
her. ``You need a user name,'' I explained. ``What do you want to
use?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not my real name,'' she cautioned. ``I don't want anybody
knowing who I am.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How about . . . Sophia Loren?'' I asked. ``Or Barbra
Streisand? A clever disguise won't tip people off to who you
really, really are!''
</P>
<P>
   She shot me a look, then thought for a long, long time. ``Um . .
. Cory!'' she finally said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your dog?'' I said as I typed it in. ``I don't know, Mom.
``Entertainment Tonight'' might pick up on that. Well, it's taken
anyway. Pick something else.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How can it be taken?'' she argued. ``Cory is my dog! I want to
use that name! I need something I can remember!''
</P>
<P>
   So then she made me enter the names of all the dead dogs we've
ever had, like Bambi, Pookie, Ginger and Brandy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is dangerous, Mom. You know those all sound like porno
stars,'' I said, but she just ignored me. ``You'll be a pervert
magnet.''
</P>
<P>
   After we learned that those were also all taken, she agreed to
the next available ``Cory'' name, which was ``Cory34.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now just how am I supposed to remember that?'' she said, still
pouting. ``I'm going to have to change the dog's name! `Want a
cookie, Cory34? Look, Cory34 made a doody on the floor.' Oh, yeah.
That sounds smart. Just show me Rosie's stuff!''
</P>
<P>
   I clicked on the Rosie pumpkin head, and the new screen appeared
with the charity auctions. When my mother got a good look at what
was up for sale, she threw down her mouse and balked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rosie's out of her fat little head if she thinks I'm paying
$1,000 for Madonna's autograph!'' she said in disbelief. ``I don't
even like Madonna! That's not help! I'll help somebody, I'm not
above that, sure, here's five dollars! But this? That's like asking
for a kidney! Get me off this thing! You stop laughing at me,
Laurie!''
</P>
<P>
   When I went home later that night, I checked my e-mail. I
already knew what it said before I opened it, but I clicked on it
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi Laurie. It's Mom. If you write a column about this, I'll
kill you. From, Mom.'' &QL;

MEXICANS CROSS BORDER FOR BARGAINS ON GASOLINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DANE SCHILLER  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAREDO, Texas _ While droves of Americans cross into Mexico for
bargains on blankets and beer, increasing numbers of Mexicans are
driving to the U.S. side of the border for an inexpensive tank of
gas.
</P>
<P>
   It costs about half as much to fill up in Texas border cities as
it does across the Rio Grande in Mexico, where the government owns
the national oil company.
</P>
<P>
   The price disparity has left dust gathering on gasoline pumps
while steady streams of Mexicans head to gas stations and
convenience stores to the north.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, a gallon unleaded gasoline cost $1.03 in the
border city of Laredo; across the Rio Grande in Nuevo Laredo, the
cost was $2 per gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the American Automobile Association reported that
the average price for regular self-serve unleaded gasoline was
$1.08 per gallon nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Mayors of major Mexican border cities plan to go to Mexico City
next week to urge the federal government to subsidize gasoline
prices along the border to make them competitive with the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Jose Zarate, a spokesman for Nuevo Laredo, said the mayors
want the federal government to bring gasoline prices back under
control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some stations are on the verge of closing,'' Zarate said by
telephone. ``There is a tremendous difference. We have got to
equalize the prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts attribute the higher prices in Mexico to the
cash-strapped government siphoning away profits from the state-run
oil company, Pemex.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government tends to lean heavily on Pemex during times of
financial distress,'' said Michael Patrick, a professor at Texas
A&AMP;M International University in Laredo who specializes in border
economics. ``There is less of the pie to divide up, and the
government is still taking its fair share.''
</P>
<P>
   John Lichtblau, spokesman for the Petroleum Research Foundation
in New York City, said Mexico would use Pemex to get as much money
as it can.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is only one market there, and they (Pemex officials) can
charge whatever they want,'' Lichtblau said. ``If it costs twice as
much as Texas, that is their choice.''
</P>
<P>
   While prices at Mexican pumps are high, they are still a little
more than half of those in Europe or Japan, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Back at the pumps, there is no doubt more people are heading
north for gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone wants to know why the gasoline is not cheaper,'' said
Isabel Campos, 31, as she filled the tank of her pick-up truck in
downtown Laredo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, I need about $10 to fill the tank. There, I need $20,''
said Campos, who lives in Nuevo Laredo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of customers from Mexico,'' a manager for a
convenience store in Brownsville said by phone. ``It has increased
a lot in the past six or seven months.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Every time the producers of ``The Iceman Cometh''
want to have a light bulb changed, they need to use a three-man
crew, each member earning $43.36 an hour. To fashion the three
women's wigs they needed, the producers paid $2,250, saving at
least $750 each by having molds made of the actresses' heads and
having the hairpieces made in England. And $3,000 went for dirtying
up some of the the show's rented costumes to make them more
appropriate to the Bowery-like mise en scene.
</P>
<P>
   Such are some of the more arcane expenses behind Broadway's only
$100 ticket, for orchestra seats to the latest production of Eugene
O'Neill's barroom epic, ``The Iceman Cometh.'' The show,
transplanted from London and starring Kevin Spacey, opens Thursday
night at the Brooks Atkinson Theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iceman'' is only the third show in Broadway history to get
$100 a seat; the two-part ``Nicholas Nickleby'' did so in 1981, as
did ``Miss Saigon'' a decade later. But some Broadway veterans
suspect it is a harbinger.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, for example, the Roundabout Theater Company announced
it would increase the top price for the hit revival of ``Cabaret''
to $90. ``The Lion King'' charges $80 for a prime seat, and several
shows have had special packages that top $100 but include amenities
like private lounges, gift packs and champagne at intermission.
</P>
<P>
   Producers say the price increases are justified by rising
production expenses, costs that far eclipse dirt, wigs and bulbs.
</P>
<P>
   To illustrate this, Emanuel Azenberg, lead producer of
``Iceman,'' recently took the unusual step of opening his books and
budgets to a reporter. Many of the budget figures were estimates,
and the figures have not been audited yet by an accountant. But
several other experienced producers said the figures looked
accurate and were, if anything, somewhat lower than what they have
been paying.
</P>
<P>
   What emerges is not only Azenberg's rationale for the $100
ticket but also the intricate and sometimes laborious processes by
which ``Iceman'' and other Broadway shows spend _ and save _ money.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Iceman Cometh,'' written in 1939-40, tells the story of a
group of down-on-their-luck patrons of a seedy bar and the genial
salesman, Theodore Hickman (played by Spacey), who arrives in their
midst. Before its premier in 1946, O'Neill said it was a play
``about pipe dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   By Azenberg's figuring, it is a vision that will cost $5 million
to present on Broadway for 13 weeks. This broadly breaks out as a
$1.5 million initial capitalization to mount the show _ that is, to
bring in the stage equipment, cast it and otherwise get it ready to
open _ and $3.25 million, or $250,000 a week, in running costs.
Azenberg also expects some unbudgeted costs, like advertising for
Tony Awards.
</P>
<P>
   With the maximum potential weekly gross at roughly $500,000,
Azenberg says a sellout of the run would mean income of about $6.5
million to $6.6 million, depending on variables like possible
standing-room tickets. Subtract about 1,400 free house seats
($140,000) for Tony voters and about 300 for the press ($30,000),
and the final profit for a sellout will be roughly $1.5 million.
``A million-dollar profit, maybe, on a $1.5 million risk, is not
excessive,'' Azenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Iceman'' also presents unique challenges for a producer.
The first is its large cast: 19 actors and seven understudies. Then
there is the show's length, four and a quarter hours, which means
overtime for backstage employees and only seven shows a week. (The
Broadway standard is eight.) Finally the limited run _ 13 weeks,
the term of Spacey's commitment _ leaves a small window for
producers to earn back their $1.5 million and make a profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The play has a giant cast, it's in overtime from the get-go,
and we're only doing seven performances a week,'' Azenberg said.
``You charge any less, you're suicidal.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the show had few of the gigantic costs that typically
drive up expenses of blockbuster musicals. It has only one set, no
orchestra or pyrotechnics.
</P>
<P>
   The producers and their general manager, Abbie M. Strssler,
have scrimped and bargained to cut costs. They bought a dishwasher
for $600 to eliminate hand-washing _ and possible overtime.
Costumes were rented in England to avoid an international duty on
their purchase. And Azenberg's negotiating mantra for actors and
designers was, ``Everybody works for minimum.'' Indeed, the $1.5
million capitalization is remarkably low for a play of its size.
</P>
<P>
   Azenberg, who has been producing on Broadway for over 30 years,
said he knew sitting in the audience at the Almeida Theater in
London last May how much it would cost to move it to Broadway.
``You can do the math in about five minutes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Strassler, who oversees costs, did similar calculations. The
show has four union stagehands, each earning a weekly base of
$1,234.58 plus two hours of straight time pay a day because of the
show's length and for preshow prep work. But Ms. Strassler said the
weekly total for one backstage worker is $3,575, including base
pay, overtime, benefits, a supervision fee stipulated by the union
and a 17 percent payroll tax.
</P>
<P>
   There were other sacrifices for the art. To accommodate the set,
designed by Bob Crowley, 59 of the $100 seats were eliminated from
the front rows. That's a loss of $536,900.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing Azenberg did when committing to the show was to
ask Spacey to work for $1,135 a week, the minimum allowed by
Actors' Equity, the actors' union. He agreed, as did the rest of
the cast. (Spacey, as a producer, will also share in any profit, as
will the rest of the cast, the O'Neill estate, the director and and
the five other producers.) The director, Howard Davies, and
designers are also taking the minimum fees for their work.
</P>
<P>
   Last July, Ms. Strassler, the show's general manager, went to
London with the show's technical supervisor, who oversees
construction of the show.
</P>
<P>
   Several crucial budget decisions were made. The team realized it
would be cheaper for the producers to buy the set from the Almeida
for $35,000 and spend $15,000 to ship it to New York than to build
a new set here. Props, including dozens of glasses, were bought in
New York. The three women's wigs ran about $750 each, against $1500
to $2000 here.
</P>
<P>
   The original costumes were rented for about $3,500 and altered
for the American actors. Still, the three women's costumes were
worn out in London and were refashioned in New York at a cost of
$25,000.
</P>
<P>
   Other costumes from England arrived too clean. Ms. Strassler
said the show had to pay wardrobe workers to distress them. One
wardrobe specialist used oil and dirt to create a Bowery look.
``All I know is they came out looking really yucky,'' said Ms.
Strassler, ``and we paid for every nickle of it.'' The cost:
$3,000.
</P>
<P>
   Azenberg said that fully one-sixth of his preproduction budget,
$250,000, went to advertising, from mailings to splashy ads in The
New York Times. And $350,000 was set aside to buy or rent the stage
equipment and pay laborers to get and adapt the set, costumes,
lights and sound gear for the theater. Rental of the theater is
$10,000 a week plus an undisclosed percentage of the show's gross.
Theater owners charge producers for much of the cost of running the
theater (about $5,000) and for the salaries of a dozen or so
theater employees ($21,000).
</P>
<P>
   When a production enters a Broadway house, it finds an empty
stage. Crews have to haul in every piece of lighting and sound
equipment and the computers to coordinate it all. The initial light
budget for ``Iceman'' was $75,000, including about $20,000 to buy
bulbs, gels and other equipment. A bulb for a spotlight can run
$700, and don't even talk about burnouts.
</P>
<P>
   Replacing light bulbs is ``a major operation,'' Ms. Strassler
said. For one thing, the stage at the Atkinson is raked, so the
surface is leveled with a wedge and men support the cherry picker;
other times other equipment has to be used. Either way,
three-person crews are the norm.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of some technical elements was overestimated and others
were eliminated, including a projected announcement at the
beginning of the play asking patrons to turn off their cellular
telephones. This will save $275 a week for renting a projector.
</P>
<P>
   The set, which arrived in January, also had to be adapted at a
shop in the Bronx to fit into the Atkinson. It cost $90,000.
</P>
<P>
   Discoveries during rehearsal also swelled the budget. Four
positions not originally budgeted _ a fight director (about five
specialists do all the coaching on Broadway), a dialect coach, an
assistant director and a song teacher _ were added, costing
$15,000. Salaries and fees in rehearsal for actors, production
staff and the creative team also totaled $308,561.
</P>
<P>
   On March 29 the show had its first preview. This ended the
preproduction period and started the weekly, up-and-running
expenses, some large, some small.
</P>
<P>
   Labor, of course, is the biggest expense. Weekly salaries, from
actors to press agents, run $57,601 plus payroll tax, pension and
welfare, vacation pay and sick leave. The technical supervisor,
casting director and designers each get a weekly fee, budgeted at
$4,000. Weekly the cost is $79,489.56. Total for the entire run:
$1,033,364.20.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's miscellaneous, about $2,500 a week, from tips for
stage door staff to throat lozenges to backstage coffee. ``It's a
four-hour show,'' said Ms. Strassler. ``We can spring for coffee.''
</P>
<P>
   And when the audience sees bread and roses onstage, those are
part of the budget, too. Every night the show uses two loaves of
bread ($2.79), a jar of pickles ($1.19) and olives ($1.59) and a
dozen roses ($8-10). Because the show has two performances on
Saturday, $700 is spent to cater a meal for actors and crew.
</P>
<P>
   Even closing a show is an expense. Azenberg has budgeted
$100,000 for it, a figure Ms. Strassler says covers trash bin
rental, landfill fees, stagehands, shipping, theater restoration
and ``sending people home.''
</P>
<P>
   And if all goes well, some money is returned. The unions for the
stagehands, actors and press agents each ask for bonds and deposits
in the event that their producers can't pay their members fees. For
``Iceman,'' that means some $82,250 is frozen.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a veteran of this, I'm always grateful getting some money
back,'' Azenberg said.

A 2-WAY WATCH-PHONE DICK TRACY WOULD LOVE  
 RENT-TO-OWN COMPUTERS  
 ANTICIPATING THE HOME DVD  
 COMPUTER ON A NECKLACE  
 THOSE FUN GUYS AT MICROSOFT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Science fiction writers may have to come up with some other
symbol of the future: the watch-phone actually exists.
</P>
<P>
   Putting on the market the first timepiece that can literally
give you a wake-up call, Samsung Electronics has combined a
wristwatch and a cellular telephone into a single gadget.
</P>
<P>
   On the side of the watch-phone, called the SPH-WP10, is a tiny
speaker that broadcasts incoming calls, while a microphone on the
front of the watch permits the user to talk back. The company said
the phone's features would include voice-activated dialing, a phone
directory and a vibration alert.
</P>
<P>
   The gadget comes with a super-small processor chip and tiny
fixed antenna. Samsung said other companies had come up with
similar products but that none had come to market. It plans to
begin selling the watch-phone in April in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Will it now become fashionable for your voice mail to say,
``You've reached my watch. I'm not in right now so please leave a
message''? Alas, the answer may come more readily when the phone is
eventually introduced in the United States; that release date has
not been set yet.
</P>
<P>
   A PC for $25.99 a Month, and All the Miles Are Free
</P>
<P>
   In the spirit of the information superhighway metaphor, it seems
only fitting that, as with automobiles, it is getting increasingly
easy to lease computers rather than buy them outright.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest twist on that model, a New York company has
announced that it has created a rent-to-own plan for the latest
PCs. For $25.99 a month, plus a one-time fee of $29.99 plus
shipping and handling, Gobi Inc. sells a machine with a
300-megahertz processor, monitor, modem and Windows 98. The deal
includes Internet access, which otherwise costs around $20 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Subscribers agree to keep paying for three years (making the
total cost more than $900). They can then keep the computer for
$50, a fee that may go down, said the company's founder and chief
executive, Ganesh Ramakrishnan.
</P>
<P>
   Ramakrishnan, 26, a former anthropology and economics student
turned investment banker, said he thought that consumers would take
to leasing computers. ``A computer is not a good investment because
after two or three years, it's a totally obsolete investment,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gobi took another leaf from overzealous car dealers: hyperbole.
The company said in a news release that it planned to ``give away
computers to new Internet subscribers nationwide.''
</P>
<P>
   A Graphics Card Is Putting the Home DVD Into Range
</P>
<P>
   The venerable home video may be on the verge of a major upgrade.
Technology is emerging to make the compression of digital video
images much more affordable, which in turn will make it possible to
record, store and display digital images, and even to create home
DVDs.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, ATI Technologies announced that it was selling the
All-in-Wonder graphics accelerator card (generally speaking, such
cards help computers process and display graphics). What makes the
$170 card noteworthy is that it is the first retail product to
include new technology that makes it much more affordable to
compress digital video into MPEG form, the standard for such files.
That has been a very expensive process; the cost of creating
full-motion, full-screen digital video images has been thousands of
dollars. As the new technology, from Ligos Corp., evolves, it
should eventually enable users to capture, store and display full
motion video more easily and quickly.
</P>
<P>
   A Tiny Personal Computer So Small It Can Be Worn
</P>
<P>
   With his latest invention, Vaughan Pratt, a professor of
computer science at Stanford University, has taken one small step
for a man and one really tiny step for mankind.
</P>
<P>
   Pratt has created one of the world's smallest personal
computers. Not only can it run Windows 95 and surf the Net, but
it's also meant to be worn as a fashion statement.
</P>
<P>
   Pratt's compact computer is a mere five square inches and
four-fifths of an inch thick, but brain-wise, it dwarfs many bigger
personal digital assistants. It contains a 486 processor, 16
megabytes of RAM and a 340-megabyte hard drive. It also has ports
to connect a keyboard, monitor and modem.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is its other unusual feature: the ability to be worn
as an accessory. Pratt said one impetus behind his creation of the
puny PC was to make it wearable; it can be attached to a belt or
necklace.
</P>
<P>
   The new computer, which Pratt is temporarily calling the
matchbox PC, involves advances in the world of embedded computers.
These are computers that manufacturers put into all manner of
things big and small, like toaster ovens, cars and even watches.
Increasingly, the creators of these computers have found it
difficult to find standard software to run on them, so they have
tried to make embedded computers compatible with PC software, Pratt
said.
</P>
<P>
   What's Funny at Microsoft? Blocking Netscape's Web Site
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has the reputation of being a ruthless, cutthroat
competitor, but, hey, that doesn't mean the company doesn't know
how to have fun. In an online tutorial for Microsoft's Back Office
Server 4.0
(www.microsoft.com/backofficeserver/guide/accessfund.asp?A(EQ)2),
there is a section called Exercise 2: Control User Access to
Internet Sites that teaches customers how to block certain Web
sites. The example site used by Microsoft: www.netscape.com.
</P>
<P>
   The reference to blocking Netscape was first reported in an
online mailing list distributed by James Love, the director of the
public interest group Consumer Project on Technology. ``It
surprised me,'' Love said. ``I mean, they're being accused of
crushing Netscape. Maybe it was somebody's idea of a joke.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Breunig, group product manager for Back Office, said that
was exactly what it was. He added that the tutorial was written in
1987, well before the current antitrust suit in which Microsoft is
accused of trying to monopolize the browser market. ``At the time,
it was no surprise to anyone that we were in a competitive
environment with Netscape,'' he said. ``We thought it would be a
tongue-in-cheek thing to poke fun at our competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   Breunig pointed out that the reference to Netscape was on page
160 of a 167-page manual so customers would have to work hard to
catch the company's in joke. But if Microsoft receives enough
complaints, he said, it will remove the reference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously in the current environment, we wouldn't have chosen
Netscape,'' he added.

Cox's baseball preview.)

   BBO-HANK-HAMMER _ ATLANTA _ The Transformation of the Hammer: He
has gone from apolitical, backwoods superstar to star-crossed
middle-aged activist to the senior statesman of baseball. The Hank
Aaron that will be honored tonight on the 25th anniversary of his
career home-run record is a kindler, gentler Aaron, who has been
portrayed in any number of ways. (Stinson, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)
</P>

   GLF-MASTERS-DUVAL _ AUGUSTA, Ga. _ Perhaps the near miss at
Augusta last year led to David Duval's unbelievable domination of
the game. For years, Duval was labeled the guy who didn't have
enough moxy to win on tour, and he wore the label well in Augusta.
But when it was over, Duval began a tear that hasn't been seen in
golf since the Johnny Miller days. Now, he wants to win here.

   GLF-MASTERS-LICKLITER _ As a golfer at Wright State, Frank
Lickliter of Franklin and his college teammates were stopped at the
gate of Augusta National. They just wanted to visit the pro shop
but were told no. Instead, a guard took their orders for Master's
tournament hats and brought them out to the street. My, how things
have changed for Lickliter, who is preparing to tee off in his
first-ever Master's tournament Thursday morning. He finished 1998
among the top 10 money winners and won an invitation to Augusta. We
talk with his parents, golfing coaches and buddies in Franklin and
Wright State about Lickliter, who last month remembered where he
started by equipping his old high school team with new jackets.

<P>
   FBC-UGA-JASPER _ Jasper Sanks entered Georgia last season as one
of the most highly-publicized running backs in recent history. Many
fans thought that he might be the savior of the team at running
back, but he battled weight problems, was injured for most of the
season and was considered a major disappointment. Sanks entered
spring drills as a new player, losing nearly 20 pounds and
regaining the speed and quickness that made him a high school
All-American at Carver High in Columbus. After a frustrating
freshman year, Sanks hopes to have a better season as a sophomore.

THE IA-64 CHIP: INTEL BREAKS THE MOLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PETER WAYNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For two decades, Intel Corp. has built its astonishingly
successful computer chips on the same basic plan or architecture.
The 8086 gave way to the 286, 386, 486 and Pentium, a kind of 586,
which is why many people call this line of chips the x86.
</P>
<P>
   But all good things come to an end. Beginning next year, Intel
will begin introducing chips that follow a new plan it calls IA-64,
short for Intel's 64-bit architecture.
</P>
<P>
   The architecture of a chip is more than just wires and
transistors _ it is the structure and plan for processing
information. A computer architect specifies how big a chunk of data
a central processing unit can process at a time, what type of
mathematics can be done with the data and just how long the job
takes. It's like designing an assembly line for a data factory.
</P>
<P>
   The IA-64 architecture bears little resemblance to the old
Pentium and 486 chips. The most striking difference is that the new
chips will move data 64 bits at a time instead of 32 bits at a
time, as the current line does. The new chips are not destined for
the consumer market any time soon. Intel plans to sell the machines
to Web sites, corporate databases and other high-end users.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average user won't see one on their desktop, but when they
log into a Web site, they'll see one,'' said Ron Curry, the product
marketing manager for the new line. In other words, the servers
that hold the Web-site information may have these new chips, which
will be able to juggle more memory, more tasks and more disk space.
</P>
<P>
   Rolling out a new architecture is not easy. It is even more
difficult for Intel because its franchise is built upon supplying a
line of chips that run the same software. When Apple made the jump
from the line of chips that powered the original Macintosh to the
Power PC chips that have driven its recent computers, the company
created an unusual software emulator that allows the new chips to
simulate the old chips so people can still use their old Macintosh
programs. The transition was successful, but after five years,
Apple is just finally retiring the last bits of software for the
older machines.
</P>
<P>
   Intel is taking a different tack for its transition and
integrating a hardware-based emulator into the IA-64 chips. The new
chips will convert the old x86 software into IA-64 instructions on
their own. Curry said that kind of hardware emulation was ``the
only way you can insure real compatibility.''
</P>
<P>
   The old software will still run on the new chips, and
programmers will not need to worry about the differences if they
don't want to. Still, ambitious programmers will be able to convert
their software into IA-64 code to get greater speed.
</P>
<P>
   Changing architectures is such a complicated job for everyone
that it is a miracle that companies attempt the job at all, but the
alternative is decreased performance. Redesigning everything from
the ground up lets Intel optimize its chips to take advantage of
the latest technology.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to one of the first IA-64 chips, nicknamed Merced,
Curry said: ``Five years ago, people said to me, `Why would I ever
need 128 megabytes in my desktop machine?' Merced is able to
address terabytes of memory, and already some server guys are
talking about using it.''
</P>
<P>
   The new ways computers are used helps create a need for better
chips. Early machines strained to display some text on the screen
for word processors and spreadsheets, while it is common today for
video cards with sophisticated graphics to display
three-dimensional slime-slinging monsters. And computers once sat
like islands on desktops, but now they are tightly integrated with
the Internet. Intel would like to redesign its chips to serve these
new needs as well as possible.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest change Intel is making to its architecture is adding
new codes that tell the chip when several instructions can be
executed at the same time. They named this approach explicitly
parallel instruction computing, or Epic for short.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, it is common at tax time to run software that
checks to see if an income is above a certain level. If it is, then
the tax is computed by multiplying by one rate; if it isn't, a
lower rate is used. In the past, the computer would compare the
income level with the cutoff in one step before doing the right tax
calculation in the next step. Intel's new instruction set will
allow all three computations to be done at the same time. If the
income turns out to be above the cutoff, the result using the
higher rate of multiplication is used; otherwise, the lower figure
is used.
</P>
<P>
   That approach is faster but wasteful. The results emerge in one
step instead of two, but one-third of the computation is thrown
away. This profligacy is becoming increasingly acceptable because
more and more transistors can be squeezed onto a chip. By doing
more calculations at once, greater overall speed is possible.
</P>
<P>
   Executing multiple instructions at one time is not a new
challenge. Much of the intellectual heritage for the IA-64 comes
from supercomputing companies like Multiflow Computer and Cydrome;
they both tried to develop earlier versions of Epic computers.
After those companies failed, some of their scientists moved to
Hewlett-Packard. In the mid-'90s, Intel formed a partnership with
Hewlett-Packard that has led to the IA-64. Speaking of Multiflow
and Cydrome, Curry said: ``Certainly that technology was a
contribution to the Epic design philosophy. We tried to build upon
the best concepts available at the time and add new research that
we've done.''
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard has said it is going to take advantage of the
IA-64 chips. Software written for Hewlett-Packard's PA-RISC
computers, high-end machines that are often used as workstations,
can be quickly converted into software for the IA-64 line.
</P>
<P>
   Intel is being relatively quiet about the IA-64 line of chips
while it focuses its marketing efforts on its Pentium III chip,
which was just introduced. The first chips will not even become
available until next year, and each one will probably cost more
than many consumers pay for an entire system. High-end users, like
Web sites and graphic design firms, however, are likely to pay the
price.
</P>
<P>
   Curry said the company did not anticipate selling many IA-64
chips to consumers in the next five years. It plans to extend the
current 32-bit line, which it now calls the IA-32. ``We're working
on several 32-bit processors for consumers,'' Curry said. ``We
don't see the need for 64 bits in the consumer space anytime soon.
It doesn't mean we won't get there.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ It is hard to reconcile the quiet figure of Vito
Acconci, aspiring architect, with the swath he has cut as an artist
over the last 30 years. Can this kind-eyed 59-year-old, almost lost
among the computer-aided design stations and unopened crates in his
cavernous new Brooklyn studio, be the same man who, in his 1969
``Following Piece,'' recorded a month of days spent stalking
strangers through the streets of New York? Or who, in his infamous
``Seedbed'' installation of 1972, broadcast his erotic fantasies
about gallery-goers to them as they walked above him on a plywood
ramp and he indulged himself in privacy below?
</P>
<P>
   In his celebrated career, Acconci's Bronx-bred skepticism and
unshackled intelligence have taken him from raw poetry to body-art
performances that tested the sharpness of the edges where the
public and private worlds meet.
</P>
<P>
   Today, however, his attentions are focused on gentler things.
Vito Acconci, the enfant terrible emeritus of the downtown art
world, is using his increasingly housebroken art to put a humane
spin on contemporary architecture.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, his small team at Acconci Studio completed several
projects that are playfully at odds with the buildings in which
they are sited but in tune with the physical and psychological
needs of those who use them.
</P>
<P>
   At a new U S Airways terminal at the Philadelphia International
Airport, Acconci designed a waiting area where harried travelers
can hide within huge curls that peel from the building's terrazzo
floor. In a similar move at a convention center in Milwaukee, he
pulled the material of an exterior walkway through a glass wall,
folding it over at different points to form droopy benches and a
bus shelter. Like many of his works, his 1995 installation at
Queens College, a surreal constellation of inhabitable orbs
scattered around a small plaza, inserts a human scale that spars
with the humorless public space around it, in this case creating
sheltered nooks that fill with smoking students between classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to take the word `public' as literally as possible, so
our work should be public in the sense that it is publicly usable,
publicly available, publicly accessible,'' he said in a voice so
thick and resonant that words tend to rattle around in it before
they tumble out.
</P>
<P>
   In its impish refusal to respect traditional limitations, his
architectural work echoes the urges that drove his art. ``The main
reason to start doing art was a resentment against the `Do Not
Touch' signs in a museum,'' he said recently, between drags on the
first of a chain of Gaul-oises. ``In every other field of life, you
come across something for the first time, and you pick it up, you
turn it upside down. But in art, the tradition was: `You're here.
It's there.' So you're always in the position of desire.''
</P>
<P>
   Frustration with hands-off art led first to projects like
``Claim,'' in 1971, in which Acconci dramatized the distance
between artists and the public by wielding lead pipes and a crowbar
while sitting blindfolded at the bottom of a stairway in a SoHo
gallery. Beginning in 1980, he used a lighter touch to erase the
same boundary with a series of installations in which viewers had
to complete a sculpture by operating a system of pulleys attached
to a swing, a go-cart or a bicycle.
</P>
<P>
   From its antisocial beginnings, Acconci's work has gradually
engaged ever more with the public, culminating in his current
almost-architectural work. (While he is not trained as an architect
_ his clients are often public agencies with money for art _
Acconci's recent commissions would be the envy of any young
architecture firm.)
</P>
<P>
   Holly Solomon, the pioneering New York gallery owner, has
followed Acconci's career since the early 1970s, when he performed
regularly at a space near her original gallery at 98 Greene St. She
said recently that she thinks ``Vito Acconci, architect'' makes
perfect sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's a far-flung occupation, or preoccupation,
for Vito,'' she said. ``Instead of just stating the cruelty of
modern society, he's making a contribution.''
</P>
<P>
   Still images from a videotape of ``Corrections,'' a 1972
performance in which Acconci burned a tuft of hair from his neck
with a match, are on view through May 4 as part of the ``Sight
Gags'' exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art. The distance that
Acconci has traveled from those angrier days was evident last month
at a ceremony to honor the winners of the New York City Art
Commission design awards. Trolling through a reception at the top
of City Hall's floating spiral stairway, clad from head to toe in
black artist's fatigues, he seemed perfectly at home, despite the
fact that his only previous visit to the building had been to
protest changes to the loft laws in the 1980's.
</P>
<P>
   The award Acconci received that night at City Hall recognized
his design for a perimeter fence at the Newtown Creek sewage
treatment plant, a sprawling, 53-acre installation in Brooklyn.
Jean Parker Phifer, president of the Art Commission, said the
project was selected because of the respect it shows for its
surroundings. ``It literally brings the neighborhood into the
plant,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At Newtown Creek, as in his art, Acconci could not resist
touching things that are normally off-limits. He tried to soften
the edges of the site as a way to ``mix'' the neighborhood and the
plant. The approved design, which will be completed with an upgrade
of the plant sometime before 2010, is a skein of concrete walls
that create small parks and pools of water as they coil around the
property line.
</P>
<P>
   Where the proposed border meets the plant's visitor center, one
of a number of buildings at Newtown Creek designed by the New York
architectural firm of Polshek Partners, Acconci's aversion to
boundaries takes over in force. As designed, his walls will
penetrate the building's glass facade to enclose pockets of public
space within, even sending a low tendril around the elevator core
to form a tranquil pool.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything, we saw it as the architects inviting us in,''
Acconci said. ``Maybe this betrays an amazing innocence or false
innocence on our part, but we didn't think we were trying to attack
the building. We thought, `Let's take the building, and let's play
with the elements.'''
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, Polshek Partners, which prides itself on its
seriousness, was not amused by what some saw as Acconci's
sensationalism. The community, however, seemed thrilled. Bob
Gormley, community liaison for the Newtown Creek Monitoring
Committee, said the plant's neighbors appreciated the way he was
``tweaking Polshek's design.'' And they showed they appreciated
Acconci himself by showing up in larger than average numbers to see
his understated, poetic presentations at design panels and
community board meetings.
</P>
<P>
   At a terminal now under construction at the San Francisco
International Airport, Acconci again pushed the edge of the
envelope _ and the architects from the local office of Skidmore,
Owings &AMP; Merrill _ with a proposal for the entire complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``The expected response was, `You're trying to take over our
building,''' he said with a smile. ``We probably were.'' The
parties eventually agreed on a site in an 800-foot-long transfer
corridor, for which Acconci has designed a lighting system that
doubles as an enclosure for public telephones.

 &HT;    CLINTON BACKS CHINA'S ADMISSION TO TRADE GROUP
 &HT;    630&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On the eve of a meeting with Premier Zhu Rongji of
China, President Clinton on Wednesday strongly advocated China's
entry into the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   He also warned American politicians against turning
disagreements over his China policy into a ``campaign-driven cold
war'' against Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   China's admission into the WTO, the international body created
in 1995 to regulate international commerce, is ``profoundly in our
national interest,'' Clinton said in a hastily arranged speech to
the United States Institute for Peace.
</P>
<P>
   He said that his policy of ``principled, purposeful engagement''
of China is encouraging Beijing to open up politically and
economically.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and Chinese trade negotiators have worked furiously in
recent weeks to strike a deal that could be announced during Zhu's
visit to Washington, which ends Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The discussions have been good. We continue to move forward on
trying to narrow differences, but we're not done,'' Lael Brainard,
a senior official of the White House National Economic Council,
said Wednesday at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Clinton noted that his so-called ``strategic
partnership'' with China has come under sharp attack in recent
weeks as the campaign for the Republican presidential nomination
has gotten under way.
</P>
<P>
   One candidate, Pat Buchanan, charged Monday that Clinton's
policy ``has degenerated into willful self-delusion and craven
appeasement'' that ultimately will lead to ``confrontation and
possible conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   The president countered Wednesday that ``as the next
presidential election approaches, we cannot allow a healthy
argument to lead us toward a campaign-driven cold war with China,
for that would have tragic consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said a U.S. stance similar to the 40-year cold war with
the former Soviet Union would benefit no one ``except for the most
rigid backward-looking elements in China itself.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We should not look at China through rose-colored glasses,'' he
said, but neither ``should we look through a glass darkly to see an
image that distorts China's strength and ignores its
complexities.''
</P>
<P>
   Zhu, the third-ranking person in the Chinese communist
hierarchy, is one of China's most reform-minded leaders, according
to some experts. Because of a few leaders like Zhu, ``China today
is considerably more open than the China of 10 years ago,'' said
Richard Haas, foreign policy director at the Brookings Institution,
a public policy research center in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu's nine-day, six-city visit to the United States began
Tuesday in Los Angeles and includes a joint news conference with
Clinton on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The tour comes just weeks before the 10th anniversary of
Beijing's bloody crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in
Tiananmen Square, which has become a rallying cry for critics of
China's human rights violations.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Wednesday, Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., one
of the most outspoken critics of China, called on Clinton in his
meetings with Zhu to request the release of political prisoners
held since the 1989 massacre.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton's policy has led to increased commerce and
cultural exchanges with China, it has done little in the area of
human rights, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not about isolating China, we're about engaging China in
a principled way that promotes our values, that promotes
international security of the world and grows our economy through
exports, which are our pillars of our foreign policy,'' Pelosi
said.
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi, a political ally of the president, was joined by Rep.
Christopher Cox, R-Calif., a frequent critic. Cox expressed concern
that Clinton's conversations with Zhu would ``focus not on human
rights but on the World Trade Organization ... not on freedom of
thought but on commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   There is little about the current political atmosphere to
encourage deeper ties between Washington and Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, China has vigorously condemned NATO's bombing of
Yugoslavia, a former ally of China's.
</P>
<P>
   But the atmosphere is also rife with allegations that China has
stolen U.S. nuclear secrets and used military intelligence funds to
make illegal contributions to the Democratic Party during Clinton's
re-election campaign in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the United States is sponsoring a resolution at the
annual United Nations Humanitarian Commission in Geneva condemning
China's human rights record.
</P>
<P>
   And with the trade deficit with China continuing to widen _ it
is currently $57 billion _ American businesses have accused Beijing
of denying the United States access to its market. This accusation
that appears to be at the heart of the discussions over China's
admission to the WTO.
</P>
<P>
   ``China has broad access to our markets, as you can see from any
perusal of recent trade figures,'' Clinton noted Wednesday. ``If
China accepts the responsibilities that come with WTO membership,
that will give us broad access to China's markets while
accelerating its internal reforms and propelling it toward
acceptance of the rule of law.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is this: if China is willing to play by the
global rules of trade, it would be an inexplicable mistake for the
United States to say no,'' the president added.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu, while in Washington, is also expected to meet with
officials of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund and
key members of Congress. He also is slated to visit Denver,
Chicago, Boston and New York.

   YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO CRISIS
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-MAIN _ WASHINGTON _ President Clinton says Belgrade's
cease-fire is ``not enough'' to avert more NATO air strikes. The
president said it's not enough for Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic
to halt attacks in a Kosovo. Clinton said Milosevic must withdraw
his forces, allow Albanian refugees to return and permit an
international peace force to deploy in Kosovo. Meanwhile, a
representative from Cyprus has flown to Belgrade to try to secure
the release of three U-S captives. He told reporters he's confident
his mission will succeed. The plan is to turn the soldiers over to
American officials once they're freed. Also, NATO claims to have
hit some Serb tanks. Developing. (Deans, Cox News Service).

</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-BOSNIA _ SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Hercegovina _ Since the
airstrikes began, Bosnians have anxiously listened for the buzz of
the NATO bombers that fly over every day on their way to
neighboring Yugoslavia. But many observers worry the conflict next
door holds more than noise for this still very war-torn country. It
is hardening the ethnic divisions here, causing some to worry that
it could ultimately cause the break-up of Bosnia and the end of the
Dayton Peace Accords. Because while half the country listens to the
planes and hopes NATO will bomb the Serbs into submission and
rescue the Kosovo Albanians quickly, the other half, the Bosnian
Serb half, listens angrily to what they see as an attack on their
brethren across the border and talks of armed resistance. (Nesmith,
Cox News Service.)
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-MONTENEGRO _ PODGORICA, Montenegro, Yugoslavia _ In an
interview, Montenegro President Milo Djukanvoic says the U.S.-led
NATO air strikes are destabilizing his government. Under his
leadership, Montenegro has adopted pro-Western reforms but remains
part of the Yugoslav federation. Those reforms, and even his
well-being, are at risk as rumors of a possible coup continue to
circulate. (Holmes, Cox News Service).

   CHICK _ SANDTON, South Africa _ For Dan Cathy, as for his
father, Chick-fil-A founder Truett Cathy, doing business is as much
about helping people as it is about making money. Which is
fortunate, because the Atlanta-based fast-food chain is finding
that the economic climate in South Africa poses significant
challenges, including interest rates in the high teens and an
economy that shrank in the last quarter of last year. But there's
no denying that, in a country where unemployment is estimated at
nearly 40 percent, Chick-fil-A, by opening stores, is helping
people. Today April 8 the chain will open its third store in South
Africa, this time in a mall in Sandton, an upscale northern suburb
of Johannesburg. (Melvin, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). WITH

   MEXICO-GOVERNOR _ MEXICO CITY _ Mexico's attorney general has
issued an arrest warrant on drug-smuggling charges for the former
governor of Mexico's Quintana Roo state. But the warrant was issued
just one day after Mario Villanueva left office and confirmed in a
letter to Mexican newspapers that he had fled Mexico, fearing he
would be arrested. He says he is the victim of a political
vendetta. Authorities say he helped Mexico's Juarez drug-smuggling
cartel move tons cocaine into the United States. Mexico could now

   VIDALIA _ State Agriculture Commissioner Tommy Irvin has issued
a warning to Vidalia onion farmers: don't send onions to market too
early. Irvin mailed a letter to all registered growers this week
after an eight-member committee governing the Vidalia onion
industry expressed concern that in recent years, some farmers have
tried to rush early onions to market early in order to get the best
prices. Such onions are not fully developed, therefore they don't
have the hallmark sweetness of Vidalias and they can go bad quicker
than fully ripe onions. Fully ripe onions are expected to hit
grocery shelves in about two weeks. (Walker, Atlanta

   OCTOGENARIAN-DIES _ ATLANTA _ Grover Cleveland was president

aerobics well past her 100th birthday, Mrs. McDaniel was featured

College President Delores Cross had made tough decisions without

after her mother was committed to a mental institution; she also
overcame a stuttering problem. ``I didn't have the classic middle
class upbringing you normally associate with college presidents,''
Cross said. So, when she stood in front of an angry crowd of
faculty members on March 9 and told them that despite their pleas,
they would probably still get fired, it was not out of character.
Last Thursday, Cross fired several faculty members, fulfilling her
promise to start cleaning house to, in her opinion, restore
academic integrity at the 118-year-old historically black
institution. (Suggs, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). WITH PHOTOS.

Friedkin grins at the life-size figure that dominates the office of
one of Florida's biggest contributors to the Democratic Party. With

TCU HONORS CRUSTY AMERICAN COMPOSER
</HEADLINE>
 IVES-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WAYNE LEE GAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ For the music lovers of my generation,
composer Charles Ives will always be a hero _ a crusty American who
anticipated major innovations of modern music decades before anyone
else, and who beat the system in a way only baby boomers can
appreciate.
</P>
<P>
   We loved the way he enshrined unmistakably American materials,
such as ``Old Black Joe'' or ``Rock of Ages,'' within sturdy
traditional forms such as sonatas and symphonies.
</P>
<P>
   We loved the way that thick, almost incomprehensible dissonance
overwhelmed the listener _ only to be interrupted by a comforting
wisp of familiar melody, be it a bit of Beethoven or a scrap from
``Come Thou Fount of Every Blessing,'' ``Jesus Loves Me'' or
``Shall We Gather.'' Few composers have so successfully created a
dreamlike sensation, in which familiar reference points drift in
and out of a tangle of musical noise.
</P>
<P>
   But those of us for whom Ives stood as an affirmation of
American culture in the midst of the mess of Vietnam, Watergate and
social decadence are getting older. There are fewer and fewer of us
who grew up singing ``Rock of Ages'' to the accompaniment of an
out-of-tune piano, and who learned what a camp meeting was from
people who had really been to one. We are surely the last
generation that will hear Ives' music with this sort of emotional
attachment.
</P>
<P>
   Ives died in 1954 at 79; this week, Texas Christian University
commemorated the 125th anniversary of his birth with an ``Ives of
Texas'' festival Monday through Wesnesday.
</P>
<P>
   Born in small-town Connecticut, the son of a local bandmaster,
Ives went to Yale University and studied composition with Horatio
Parker, whose music and tastes reflected a style predominant in
Europe decades earlier. Ives quickly headed in a different
direction, writing tough, difficult music in which the beauty is
not in the sound, but in the ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Ives realized early on that he would never be able to earn a
living writing the sort of music he heard in his mind. Thus came
about the huge joke he played on the world, and the joke we still
love: He became rich as an insurance executive in Manhattan, and
spent his weekends on a farm in Connecticut, writing the music he
wanted to write without regard for fashion or trend.
</P>
<P>
   Heart disease forced his early retirement from the business
world; fortunately, he already had plenty of money. Unfortunately,
the disease also weakened his creative drive, and his long
retirement produced no new significant works.
</P>
<P>
   Was Ives really the musical Whitman, Thoreau and Lincoln all
rolled into one that we imagined? Will his music endure in the new
century?
</P>
<P>
   Some already say no.
</P>
<P>
   In his ``Companion to 20th Century Music,'' the acerbic British
commentator Norman Lebrecht dismisses Ives as ``a figure of supreme
importance in America and curiosity value elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   There is much speculation and evidence that the early advocates
of Ives in the 1930s and 1940s did a bit more than the customary
arranging, shuffling and editing to give his most powerful scores
their impact. Even composer Elliott Carter, one of Ives' early
admirers, has said that Ives added some of the modernisms in his
music retrospectively.
</P>
<P>
   Also, some of Ives' writings and comments have, in the age of
political correctness, become a bit of an embarrassment. There are
moments of poetry in his prose, but there are those sticky
paragraphs in which music that he considered bad is associated with
femininity, and music he considered good with rugged masculinity.
He refers to Chopin ``with a skirt on,'' and Richard Strauss'
``Salome'' as a ``money-getting costume of effeminate
masculinity.'' A critic in Boston who didn't take to Ives' music
was ``a nice old lady.'' On one passage of his own music, he
scrawled, ``This is music for men to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite these problems, J. Peter Burkholder, professor of
musicology at Indiana University and president of the Charles Ives
Society, points out that recordings and performances of Ives' music
are increasing _ and that the TCU event is the third Ives festival
he is attending this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Better than any American of his time, he integrated popular
music with his superb classical training,'' Burkholder says.
``There's something about the sound of an American hymn or fiddle
tune that's recognizable even if you don't know the music
beforehand. The idea that Ives' importance is only as a radical
experimenter is fading; there's real staying power in his music.''

MICROSOFT TO RELEASE NEW EDITION OF WINDOWS 98 IN FALL &HT;    
 &HT;   
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   Microsoft Corp. will release an updated version of its Windows
98 operating system this fall, though users who want its new
features will have to pay for them.
</P>
<P>
   The update's bug fixes, though, will be free for the downloading
from Microsoft's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   News of the new version, to be called Windows 98 Second Edition,
caused a stir in online discussion groups after early reports
indicated its bug fixes would only be available at an $89 cost _
the price of Windows 98 itself.
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft spokesman Peter Keller said the new version would
replace the current Windows 98 upgrade CD on store shelves. That
disk is used to go from Windows 3.1 or Windows 95 to Windows 98,
and costs $89.
</P>
<P>
   Another CD aimed at existing Windows 98 users will be sold
through the Microsoft Web site for a much smaller price tag that's
yet to be determined, Keller said.
</P>
<P>
   The updated version will be sent to computer manufacturers
sometime in the third quarter, and will show up on PCs and on store
shelves in early fall, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The bug fixes, to be bundled together into a package called
Service Pack 1, will be posted on Windows Update, a Web site that
lets Windows 98 users grab patches and fixes.

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: TWO VOICES FROM THE PAST THAT ECHO IN TODAY'S
BIAS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Among the treats of ``Writing New York,'' the new Library of
America anthology edited by Phillip Lopate, are generous excerpts
from a pair of remarkable 19th-century diaries that speak to us
from a charmed distance in a sometimes uncharmingly immediate way.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Hone (1780-1851) and George Templeton Strong (1820-75)
had much in common. As well as being inveterate and invaluable
diarists, both were successful businessmen and civic personages.
</P>
<P>
   As certified members of the city's self-designated elite they
were accustomed to running things until their set, with its
Colonial credentials and nativist assumptions, gave way to a flood
of immigrant insurgents.
</P>
<P>
   As Strong was in the throes of chronicling the decades in four
million words, the action was moving uptown from its center around
Wall Street. (``How this city marches northward!'' he exults.)
</P>
<P>
   The diarists' accounts of social, commercial and political
doings are larded with New York names: Ogden and Tappan,
Schermerhorn and Olmstead, Griswold and Astor, Fish and Field. From
such descendants of Olde New York were drawn the masters of the
Stock Exchange, who traded tips at the Union Club, the Episcopal
elders who worshiped at Trinity Church, the lords of Fifth Avenue
mansions, the guest lists for brilliant fetes, the benefactors of
the needy and the names of many city landmarks.
</P>
<P>
   But even as they were writing, the patricians were being swamped
by families of no wealth or distinction. The young profession of
urban demography found its subject as one group of newcomers gave
way to others and to still others in an inimitably American saga.
</P>
<P>
   For the 19th-century Establishment, it was an invasion of the
unwashed; that at any rate was how the best and the brightest, like
Hone and Strong, greeted the Irish who sought succor in America and
whose muscle built the city both horizontally and vertically. They
were lumped by many Anglo-Saxon Protestants as an ignorant and
superstitious mass.
</P>
<P>
   Hone, not a particularly mean-spirited man, saw the early
immigrants as an alarming element that was susceptible to
rabble-rousing incitement against ``the aristocracy,'' a word the
patricians took unironically for themselves despite their
revolutionary pretensions.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the devastating potato blight of the 1840s that gave
the city a Celtic cast, Hone wrote: ``These Irishmen, strangers
among us, without a feeling of patriotism or affection in common
with American citizens, decide the elections in the city of New
York.''
</P>
<P>
   He warned that ``the same brogue'' in which political demagogues
instructed them to shout ``Hurrah for Jackson!'' would in time be
turned to cries of ``Down with the natives!'' Everything about the
Irish seemed to invite terror or mockery. Strong called the tale of
St. Patrick's campaign against snakes ``a popish delusion.'' He
preferred to believe that the snakes perished of biting Irish
people.
</P>
<P>
   By the financial crisis of 1857, in Strong's view, the
subversive contingent included German socialists, many of whom were
out of work and were even more dangerous than the Irish. True
Americans, after all, did not gather in alehouses to listen to one
another rant their foreign-bred opinions, sometimes in a foreign
tongue.
</P>
<P>
   While admiring the charitable efforts of women of his class,
Strong had little compassion for the rowdy unemployed: ``Certainly
the destitute are a thankless set and deserve little sympathy in
their complaints.'' To counter the corruption and violence
associated with the underclass, he liked the idea of a vigilante
group of well-born respectables who would take the law into their
own hands.
</P>
<P>
   Such sentiments have been expressed, though not always so
candidly, down the decades. No immigrant group has been spared.
Being deemed a threat by self-advertised patriots is a rite of
passage in America. And hard times or political commotion, as
Strong's compelling account of the ferocious 1863 draft riots
attests, brought out truly murderous passions.
</P>
<P>
   The one group for which Strong found sympathy, out of opposition
to slavery and perhaps because the New York Irish were among their
tormentors, were blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Although he is given to racial epithets, he wrote after reports
of beatings and lynchings: ``They are the most peaceable, sober and
inoffensive of our poor, and the outrages they have suffered during
this last week are less excusable _ are founded on worse pretext
and less provocation _ than the St. Bartholomew's or the
Jew-hunting of the Middle Ages.'' Thus did another widely despised
minority, the Jews, benefit at that hour at least from not being
Irish.
</P>
<P>
   But of course neither blacks nor Jews, neither Italians nor
Latinos have been spared the cruel attentions of those who came
before. George Templeton Strong and Philip Hone were far from
vicious; by most standards they seem to have been honest dealers.
Yet like so many other Americans, they made life miserable for the
strangers who arrived among them with their odd and threatening
ways.
</P>
<P>
   So ``Writing New York'' is not altogether a cheering excursion.
But reassurance is available in the fate of the once denigrated
groups who caused the descendants of the Founders such distress and
in turn were distressed by the arrival of even more foreign-seeming
folks than themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The likes of Ralph Ellison, Isaac Bashevis Singer, Mario Puzo,
Mary McCarthy and Al Smith, among the many contributors to these
rich pages, evidence the unstoppable American odyssey that has been
both the country's dream and its nightmare.

THE EAGLE AS ICON: PREDATOR OR FAT HEN? 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PHIL PATTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even wars have logos these days, at least on television, and the
coverage of the conflict in Kosovo invariably features the Albanian
eagle, splashed across the screen like the NBC peacock.
</P>
<P>
   The eagle, carried by Kosovo's ethnic Albanians, is angular,
Gothic, almost medieval in style. With its two heads and dragonlike
claws, it seems to sum up the ancient nature of the conflicts in
the Balkans _ and the fears Americans have of an area they don't
understand. It's a feathered version of all the fears of foreign
entanglements we've worried about since Washington's farewell
address.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to national heraldry, on flags and seals, the
eagle has no competition. The bird rears from the Defense
Department seal behind Secretary William Cohen as he chats with
Katie Couric, and ripples in banners in civilian rallies in
Belgrade. In Germany recently, the eagle was the subject of debate
in the Bundestag, the German parliament, which will meet for the
first time April 19 in its new home, the restored Reichstag
building in Berlin, under the eyes of a new eagle.
</P>
<P>
   The building, given a glass dome by the architect Sir Norman
Foster, required a larger version of the federal eagle Germans have
seen for decades. That eagle was a figure iconically familiar to
Germans who grew up in the 1950s and '60s, said Bernd Polster, a
design critic, author and filmmaker, who lives in Bonn and who was
born in 1953, the year the eagle went up in the Parliament
building. ``It matched the Bauhaus architecture of the Bundestag,''
Polster said. ``It was always on the screen when TV showed speeches
from the parliament. But it was better known as the `fette henne'
or `fat chicken.'''
</P>
<P>
   The fat hen was the work of Ludwig Gies, an Expressionist
sculptor whose credentials included being officially marked as
``decadent'' by the Nazis. His flat aluminum bird, speckled with
lights, was presented as the Bundesadler, the federal eagle, as
opposed to the old imperial eagle, the Reichsadler. It came to
represent a modernized parliamentary Germany, but at the same time
the fat hen summed up the returning prosperity of the 1950s and
'60s, along with a certain plump self-satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of Europe and many Germans themselves have looked
warily at the government's move to Berlin, alert to signs of
over-aggressiveness. A leaner, perhaps meaner, eagle, designed by
Foster's office, was rejected in favor of a larger version of the
Gies eagle: a huge bird made of two and a half tons of aluminum.
The Foster bird had been criticized as aggressive and imperial _
too close to the eagles that Albert Speer set atop the buildings he
designed for Hitler. When the enlarged chicken-eagle was unveiled,
Bundestag President Wolfgang Thierse declared that it was ``as
peaceful as an eagle can be.''
</P>
<P>
   Germans have long worried about the retrograde qualities of
their eagles. Only clever updating made the imperial eagle
acceptable for the logo of Lufthansa, the national airline. That
bird seems to have been folded in half like a paper airplane and
tilted for takeoff. It suggests the eagle as phoenix, rising from
ashes.
</P>
<P>
   The Albanian eagle is the kind that the Germans are at pains to
avoid. In appearance, it is a relative of the imperial eagles of
Russia and Austria. The eagle has long been associated with empire,
topping the standards of Roman legions, heralding Russian and
Austro-Hungarian domains. It admits of many variants. The Mexican
eagle fights a snake; the American bald eagle clutches arrows in
one set of claws and olive branches in the other.
</P>
<P>
   That such ornithological subtleties should signal political
shades of meaning is testimony to the power of the image. The
American bald eagle is flourishing, well on its way to escaping
endangerment. Today, when F-15E Strike Eagles are flying, and
Screaming Eagle paratroopers may be in the wings, it's clear that
Benjamin Franklin's suggestion of the nonaggressive wild turkey as
national bird never had a chance.
</P>
<P>
   In creating the new, reassuringly nonbelligerent Berlin eagle,
the designers faced another quandary. Because of the placement of
the eagle, it is visible from both sides, and its rear end had to
be modeled, too _ no easy task. The eagle must turn tail feather
toward the former East bloc with suitable dignity. Universal as is
their heraldry, few eagles ever show their backs.

SCIENCE AND POLITICS MAPPED ON A WOMAN'S BODY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Author identification and publication notes are at end of
review.) 
(nk) 
 By MARILYN YALOM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Natalie Angier's dazzling new book calls upon biology and
evolution to celebrate the female body. Its upbeat message _ that
women are far stronger, more sexual, aggressive and adaptive than
usually given credit for _ is supported by rigorous scientific
underpinnings. In laying out her argument, she takes on those
currently fashionable evolutionary psychologists who present women
as fundamentally less interested in the joys of sex and worldly
achievement than men and therefore programmed for monogamous unions
with older, higher-status males.
</P>
<P>
   Tain't so, says Ms. Angier, a Pulitzer Prize-winning science
writer for The New York Times. Look again. What you'll see through
her eyes will startle and amaze you.
</P>
<P>
   To begin with, there are the sex chromosomes: two X chromosomes
for women, and one X and one Y for men. In the view of Ms. Angier's
father (a major presence in her psychic life), chromosomes prove
the case for male superiority: X and Y equal diversity and genius,
while X and X are ``chromosomal bores.'' Yet as Ms. Angier takes
pleasure in noting, the X chromosome is six times larger than the Y
and has a ``vastly higher gene richness.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the egg, the largest cell in the body and the only
spherical one, ``a geometer's dream'' likened to a pearl that lasts
for decades and is hard to crush. It is ``the true sun, the light
of life.'' Such flights into poetic rapture can be counted as one
of the book's stylistic strengths, along with the first-person
anecdotes that add a wryly humorous note.
</P>
<P>
   Moving from the microscopic to bigger body parts, ``Woman: An
intimate Geography'' dramatizes female anatomy and physiology. A
chapter on the evolution of the clitoris reminds us that Freud had
it all wrong: His theory that clitoral orgasm is ``infantile'' and
vaginal orgasm ``mature'' should be seen as ``a blot on history's
understanding of female sexuality.'' Instead, Ms. Angier writes,
the clitoris has no greater end than to serve women's pleasure, and
that is end enough. Unlike its drudge male homologue, the penis, on
duty for both urination and ejaculation, the clitoris is a
specialized organ capable of repeated stimulation and multiple
orgasm.
</P>
<P>
   Given these facts, we are asked to ponder why men's sexual
satisfaction is more aggrandized than women's. And we are asked to
consider the reasons that clitoridectomy is still practiced on some
two million women each year, mainly in Africa. Here Ms. Angier does
not mince her words: ``Genital cutting is an extreme abuse of human
rights. Like slavery and apartheid, it is unacceptable.'' She says
it must be fought by every possible form of political pressure.
</P>
<P>
   While the crestlike clitoris exists solely for the gratification
of its owner, the mouthlike vagina can accommodate a variety of
objects ranging from a tampon to a baby's head. The vagina is an
``ecosystem,'' easily disturbed by venereal microbes, though it is
usually healthy and robust, especially when one considers all the
fluids that flow in and out of it.
</P>
<P>
   And one must not forget that other quintessentially female body
part, the uterus. Here, too, the reader of ``Woman'' encounters a
bracing mix of fallacy, science and politics. For example, in one
of his drawings, Leonardo da Vinci established a connection from
the uterus to the breast under the mistaken Renaissance belief that
menstrual blood somehow became maternal milk.
</P>
<P>
   More to the point today is the question of ownership. Pro- and
antiabortion spokesmen claim the right to determine what may or may
not take place in the uterus. Does the uterus belong to the woman
who houses one, or, in the case of pregnant women, does it belong
to the fetus, or the fetus' representatives in the form of church
and state? Or to doctors who, Ms. Angier says, overindulge the urge
to cut by performing more Caesarean sections and hysterectomies
than are warranted? This self-proclaimed ``feminist, pro-woman''
writer takes pains to suggest that each woman should be the
mistress of her own corporeal house.
</P>
<P>
   That house includes ovaries (``gray and pitted and as lumpy as
oatmeal''), hormones (``at least 60 forms of estrogen''), breasts
(both functional and esthetic), muscles (more than 600) and fat (27
percent of the standard woman, as opposed to 16 percent of the
standard man). Though these facts can be excavated from a medical
text, they are undoubtedly more compelling in Ms. Angier's
colorful, passionate and frankly idiosyncratic account.
</P>
<P>
   The interconnections between biology and psychology are
reconfigured in fascinating chapters on female aggression, love,
pair bonding and intergenerational nurturance provided by mothers
and grandmothers, all of which are seen as adaptive in the grand
scheme of things. And it is here that Ms. Angier takes issue with
the hard-core evolutionary psychologists who claim that men are
``naturally'' more promiscuous than women and that women are
inherently more interested in stable relationships.
</P>
<P>
   ``Feeble data,'' Ms. Angier declares. Her own data, culled from
observing women and other female primates, especially baboons,
suggest different conclusions. When one remembers that women have
been traditionally punished for promiscuity, adultery and other
displays of sexual desire, it is surprising that they evidence as
much lust as they do.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Angier never hides her political agenda. Nor does she hide
the insights derived personally from her life, especially from her
experiences as a daughter, wife and mother. Her own small daughter
has made her exquisitely sensitive to kinship with ``the tribe of
woman,'' starting with their similar bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Her reflections on the fierce bonds of womanhood, extending back
to prehistoric times when foraging grandmothers may have made more
difference to the survival of progeny than unpredictable hunts
conducted by men, turns evolutionary theory toward a gynocentric
vision of human endurance: one that is no less fanciful, it must be
said, than male-centered visions. But because Ms. Angier speculates
on the basis of massive hard data, she demonstrates that the term
``feminist science'' does not have to be an oxymoron.

   When it comes to picking among the thousands of mutual funds out
there, investors want a rating system that separates the wheat from
the chaff. Unfortunately, the most popular rating services get only
half of the equation. They do a good job of pinpointing the chaff
of the investing arena, but are not much help in identifying the
wheat.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Morningstar, the Chicago financial publisher that
provides the most widely used fund rating system. Morningstar ranks
funds on a scale of one to five stars, according to their
historical, risk-adjusted performance. While the ratings thus look
backward at performance, Morningstar advises that they be used as a
first tool _ though not the only one _ in selecting a fund. And
individual investors overwhelmingly choose four- or five-star funds
when investing.
</P>
<P>
   Funds in the bottom 10 percent of their universe receive one
star, while those in the top 10 percent receive five. When
calculating the stars, Morningstar ranks on the same curve all
funds in a particular universe, say domestic equity funds,
regardless of their investing style, their objective or their
holdings' market capitalizations.
</P>
<P>
   Yet while one-star funds significantly underperform the market,
five-star funds, on average, do not outperform it, according to a
recent study.
</P>
<P>
   Let's look first at the one-star funds. The study, by
Christopher R. Blake, associate professor of finance at Fordham
University's Graduate School of Business, and Matthew Morey,
assistant professor of economics at Fordham, found that those
funds, on average, trailed the market by a large margin. The
average fund that had a one-star rating on Jan. 1, 1993, lagged
behind the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index by 8.4 percentage
points a year for the five years ending Dec. 31, 1997. (That
five-year period was one of many studied, but the results are
representative of the professors' findings.)
</P>
<P>
   That performance difference is substantial, and Morningstar can
be proud that its one-star rating was so effective at identifying
such likely underperformers.
</P>
<P>
   Impressive as that may be from an academic viewpoint, it is of
limited real-world value in helping you outperform the market: All
you can do with Morningstar's list of one-star funds is avoid them.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, at the other end of the spectrum, Morningstar's
five-star funds, as a group, do not beat the market, even if they
clearly do better than the average one-star fund. For example, the
average fund with a five-star rating on Jan. 1, 1993,
underperformed the market by 3.8 percentage points for the five
years through Dec. 31, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not the only difficulty in the rankings. According
to Professors Blake and Morey, the differences between the
performances of the average five- , four- , and three-star funds
are so small as to have very little statistical significance.
</P>
<P>
   None of the other rating services monitored by the Hulbert
Financial Digest have done any better than Morningstar in
identifying funds that will outperform. For example, the Value Line
Mutual Fund Survey, created several years ago to compete with
Morningstar, also bases its ranking on historical risk-adjusted
performance, though it looks at performance over different periods
than Morningstar does and defines risk differently. Yet, on
average, its group of highest-ranked equity funds have performed
more than one percentage point a year worse than Morningstar's.
</P>
<P>
   One of the fund-picking approaches that most profitably uses
past performance data is remarkably simple, involving no
complicated risk-adjustment or long-term historical comparisons.
This system calls for the purchase each Jan. 1 of the
best-performing diversified no-load equity fund of the previous
year. According to Sheldon Jacobs, editor of the No-Load Fund
Investor in Irvington, N.Y., such an approach would have produced a
20.2 percent return, annualized, since the beginning of 1975,
beating the Wilshire 5000 by an average of 3.2 percentage points a
year and far outpacing any competing fund selection method I know.
</P>
<P>
   But there may be less here than meets the eye. For starters,
investing in last year's winners is risky. When the approach works,
it is because the stock market exhibits short-term momentum; one
year's wave often continues into the next year. But when that wave
crashes, sooner rather than later, the funds at its crest can
sometimes be the biggest casualties.
</P>
<P>
   One measure of the heightened risk comes from Mark Carhart,
formerly an assistant professor of finance and business economics
at the University of Southern California. Carhart, now co-head of
quantitative research at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, has
studied fund performance year to year back to 1962. If fund
performance were all a matter of luck, one would expect that just
10 percent of all funds in the top performing decile one year would
repeat that performance the next year. But Carhart has found that a
greater percentage of those top performers manage to do so. Here's
the catch: He has also found that the top decile performers in any
one year are more likely to end up the next year in the  &UR; bottom &LR;  10
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, investing in last year's top performers is a
crap shoot. You might be lucky. But there also a significant chance
that you'll invest in a real clunker.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs began using the strategy in late 1991 and, though it is
not his only strategy, has been recommending it to subscribers ever
since. Over the next seven years, his portfolio that uses the
strategy lagged behind the broad market by an average of 2.2
percentage points a year. Worse yet, it was also 31 percent more
volatile.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with the popular rating systems is that they do a
poor job of distinguishing between adviser skill and mere luck. And
so it is no surprise that the top-rated funds do not meet
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Consider how funds have performed over the last five years, a
period dominated by large-capitalization stocks and by growth
investing instead of a value approach. A fund manager whose focus
over these years was small-cap value would probably look awful,
even if he outperformed the average small-cap value stock. By the
same token, the manager of a large-cap growth fund could still look
good, even if his fund has trailed the average large-cap growth
stock. The real measure of an adviser's skill is outperforming a
benchmark constructed to match all relevant aspects of his
approach.
</P>
<P>
   Morningstar is aware of this criticism and has taken some steps
toward addressing it. For example, it no longer compares
international equity funds with domestic equity funds when awarding
stars. But it still puts all domestic equity funds into the same
pot, regardless of whether they are large- or small-cap, value or
growth.
</P>
<P>
   How can investors identify which funds have truly outperformed
their peers, taking into consideration the different market caps or
investing styles? I know of no service that regularly provides such
rankings, even though several, including Morningstar and Value
Line, provide much of the data necessary to do so. In the meantime,
unless they're willing to just go with the roll of the dice,
investors should judge a fund's performance only by comparing it to
others that focus on the same kinds of securities and pursue a
similar investing style.

   RALEIGH, N.C. _ In the colorful world of Davidson County Sheriff
Gerald Hege, sex offenders don green-and-white striped uniforms
while flons sport orange and white stripes.
</P>
<P>
   Black and white stripes that hark back to a bygone era are
reserved for work crews and blue and white stripes are earmarked
for low-security misdemeanants.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're either going to be buck naked or you're going to have a
striped uniform,'' declares Hege, a Republican who has critics
seeing red.
</P>
<P>
   Among them is state Sen. Tony Rand, a powerful Fayetteville
Democrat, who is working to reverse a requirement that state
inmates sport stripes while working on Davidson County road crews
or community work squads. He argues that all state inmates should
be clothed alike in all counties.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Paul ``Jaybird'' McCrary, a Lexington Democrat who retired
in 1990 after 16 years as Davidson County sheriff, agrees. But he's
trying to stay out of the stripe strife.
</P>
<P>
   Rand's bill is the latest hand grenade in a political battle
that started last summer when the sheriff persuaded state lawmakers
that his uniform system should apply not just to county jail
inmates, but to state prisoners working in the county. Davidson
County is in North Carolina's Piedmont, near Greensboro.
</P>
<P>
   ``Security-wise, you just can't beat it,'' Hege said.
</P>
<P>
   The state Department of Correction opposed the plan, but the
sheriff found an ally in Rep. Jerry Dockham, a Republican who had
the proposal inserted into the state budget with the blessing of
Republican House leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Five months later, 91 state inmates working in Davidson County
aren't wearing stripes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been stalling,'' Hege said of state Department of
Correction officials. ``They've fought it from day one.''
</P>
<P>
   Correction officials concede that they oppose the stripes, but
say they are trying to decide whether to ask prison-run garment
factories to sew the striped uniforms or order them from the same
California company Hege uses.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the price tag could hit $10,000. That's because each
inmate has 15 uniforms _ five in his locker, five in the laundry
and five spares in storage. Add to that the range of sizes needed
and ``it can become an expensive proposition,'' said Gregg Stahl,
assistant state correction secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Correction officials are wondering where to find the money, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hege, who made headlines several years ago after painting county
jail cells pink with teddy bear trim, argues that state officials
could easily come up with $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Since Republicans no longer control the House, Rand's bill has a
good chance of passing, said Dockham. ``It is kind of frustrating
to get something done and then six months later wait to have it
undone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McCrary, who oversees public-safety spending in the House,
doesn't think much of striped uniforms. But since Hege and his
stripes are popular in Davidson County, McCrary isn't lobbying for
Rand's bill.
</P>
<P>
   State correction officials now require minimum-custody inmates
to wear green uniforms and medium- and close-custody inmates to
dress in brown. They say allowing striped uniforms for state
inmates in one county could be a Pandora's box in a state with 100
counties.
</P>
<P>
   The department also maintains that inmates in a county jail, who
are typically behind bars for 90 days or fewer, should be treated
differently from state prisoners, some of whom have been
incarcerated for years and have been promoted to minimum security
road crews and community work squads.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we view striped uniforms as being helpful in
preparing an inmate to return to the community,'' Stahl said. ``The
inmates don't like it. We expect we'll have some work stoppages and
interruptions.''
</P>
<P>
   In his push to get lawmakers to require stripes for state
inmates, Hege had in his arsenal color photos of a Davidson County
woman beaten by an escaped inmate who persuaded her to let him use
her phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he had been in stripes, she would have gone into her house
and locked the door,'' said Hege, first elected in 1994. He's had
no escapes from jail or work crews in two years _ thanks, he said,
to stripes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look like a zebra out there,'' he said. ``You can't
hide.''

   DURRES, Albania _ The Hader family of Kosovo held a pathetic
picnic Wednesday. They ground a plastic beach umbrella into a field
of rubble, laid down their coats like blankets over the rocks, and
sat single file sharing their last bottle of water and their final,
stale loaf of bread.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street, a new tent city was already packed, and the
sign on its gate directed newly arrived refugees to the next town.
But like many others, the Haders were too exhausted to keep going
so they parked their tractor in an empty lot, creating their own
makeshift refugee camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you like a sip?'' Mehmed Hader, 34, asked, extending the
water bottle. Then he pulled it back. ``No, I'm sorry. I cannot
afford to be polite. I will save your sip so later we can wash
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Albania's stark, mountainous countryside is dotted with the
wrenching images of a displaced population. The official camps and
even the unofficial ones are safe zones for the ethnic Albanians
who fled for their lives from their villages in Kosovo. But to
outsiders they look like horrific limbo zones for refugees who are
too numb to be anxious about the future.
</P>
<P>
   At the gates of the camp here, a small boy slept fitfully on a
filthy blanket Wednesday, occasionally reaching out a dirt-caked
hand for bread crumbs and stuffing them into his mouth. It was a
chilling sight.
</P>
<P>
   Many first-time visitors to the camps, even if they have
followed the exodus on television, lose their emotional grip when
they first take in the scope and detail of the situation. One macho
young man, an Albanian immigrant from Queens, thought he was
prepared, but ended up Wednesday with his head between his knees,
crying and retching.
</P>
<P>
   Albania's rutted roads wind through an almost lunar landscape,
dotted with skeletons _ shells of gutted cars, frames of half-built
houses and frail scarecrows guarding shaggy fields. But Albania,
the poorest country in Europe, is for the moment a verdant jewel to
the quarter of a million refugees who have landed here since the
Serbs began driving them from Kosovo in retaliation for NATO's
bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   It is a striking irony that this small country, whose
limitations have pushed so many Albanians to emigrate, finds itself
the save haven for a wave of grateful refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not our home,'' said Selim Nivokazi, who stood outside a
crisp green tent in the official camp here. ``But right now it is
beautiful to us. We go knocking on doors with our empty bottles,
and the people give us water and make us welcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Their flight is far too recent for the refugees to feel bored by
empty days that stretch before them like giant question marks. Even
the children do not yet seem restless; those who are not too tired
or weak play marbles between the tents while their parents trade
horror stories with other refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our six-year-old son, they held a knife to his throat,'' one
woman, Nivokazi's cousin, said, lifting the boy's neck to show
where the blade sat.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father, an old man, they hit his eye with the butt of a
gun,'' another woman answered.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Italian relief workers who set up the five-day old refugee
camp here, some 30 miles north of Tirana, quickly found themselves
in the uncomfortable situation of turning their back on those they
could not accommodate. They had to post guards at the gate, and
issue small pink tickets to refugees who wanted to leave _ and
return _ to the compound.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 220 tents, and as soon as we put one up, it was filled
with people,'' said Marco Agnoloni, who is running the relief
effort for the Italian Government. ``At night, we took the little
kids standing outside the gate and squeezed them into tents. Now we
are set to open another site, about 5 kilometers down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Some refugees arrive directly here from the border, while others
come from Tirana, after they are kicked out of the ``Sports
Palace,'' which was meant to be a soup kitchen but turned into a
kind of transit camp for elderly and disabled refugees. An indoor
arena, the gymnasium floor is carpeted with bare mattresses, and in
the bleachers, refugees stare listlessly at those lucky enough to
be stretched out on them.
</P>
<P>
   Every once in a while, the loudspeaker announces that a local
resident is offering a room, and Kosovar refugees rush down to
appeal for the lodging. Some hoteliers have turned over all their
empty rooms.
</P>
<P>
   In the countryside, Idris Cruziery, who is 34 but looks 50,
looked all day Wednesday for someone so generous but could find
only rental rooms that he could not afford. He returned to the
rubble lot here defeated, but the faces of his family members lit
up: he had a bag with bread and sausage.
</P>
<P>
   In the lot, the Cruziery family _ and cousins _ has been living
in the uncovered wagon behind their tractor, which in Kosovo they
used for transporting animals. There are 20 of them, and at night
they sleep like spoons, holding each other for warmth. The children
cough and cry until the darkness lifts. For five days, they have
not left the wagon, except to use the rubble as a bathroom; there
is not even a scrubby bush to hide behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can only wonder how long we will survive like this,'' said
one of the cousins, Floria Masraka. ``We don't know what to do
except wait for someone to come and tell us what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Masraka's 85-year-old grandmother, a brown scarf tied at
her chin, cried out, ``Is there a God?''
</P>
<P>
   No one answered her, but her great-granddaughter said, ``Look,
an ice cream man!''
</P>
<P>
   Operating out of a supermarket cart, a local entrepreneur was
scooping out cones for the refugee children, many of whom still
wore the pajamas and slippers they had fallen asleep in on the
night they were chased from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   The man was selling them: 10 cents each, a special deal, he
said, because he felt bad for the Kosovar people.

KEUHHNE TEARING UP THE COURSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ The foursome was fulsome. The last two Masters
champions were matched against the reigning United States and
British amateur champions: Mark O'Meara and Tiger Woods vs. Hank
Kuehne and Spain's Sergio Garcia. For fun, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Definitely. For lots of fun.
</P>
<P>
   It was their last practice round before Thursday's Masters gets
under way, and, to make the walk through the piney woods even here
more interesting, the pros matched themselves up against the
amateurs. And, if the scores were counted, it was no contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a great match and it was very good fun,'' the
19-year-old Garcia (the fame of his game in Spain vibrant enough to
call him the next Seve Ballesteros) said at day's end. ``Ahhh . . .
but they beat us. It was amazing. We couldn't win a hole and I
think we made like six or seven birdies in four-ball, Hank and
myself, and we didn't win a hole. I find it all amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   But if scores were not counted, the day belonged to the
amateurs. For one, none other than Jack Nicklaus himself scooted up
to them on the 15th fairway on his golf cart. Nicklaus, recovering
from hip replacement surgery, wanted to have a friendly word or two
with the whole foursome, but particularly to these amateurs.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the rumors of what Texan Hank Kuehne had done off the
13th tee already were filtering back from Amen Corner to the
clubhouse, and Nicklaus had just seen for himself what Kuehne had
done off the tee on the par-5, 500-yard 15th.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a fellow play a driver to wedge in there,'' Nicklaus
said later in his annual State of Golfdom address to the media.
``Driver to wedge!''
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus said he asked Kuehne whether it was a pitching wedge or
a sand wedge.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Oh, it was a pitching wedge.' '' marveled Nicklaus at
Kuehne's response. ``OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Garcia nor Kuehne had a clue that Nicklaus would be in
Augusta, let alone on Augusta National, this week ``and it was such
a surprise when he came up to talk to us,'' said Garcia, still
thrilled at the recollection. ``He talked to us and asked us a few
questions and wished us to have a nice week.''
</P>
<P>
   And Nicklaus could not stop bringing up up Kuehne, the
23-year-old senior at Southern Methodist University. When talking
about the changes this year to the course, Nicklaus paused in
mid-thought to marvel once again, ``Incidentally, Kuehne knocked it
right over the top (of the trees) at 13. You're going to have to
buy Augusta Country Club (which adjoins the 5th, 11th, 12th, and
13th holes of Augusta National) and move (the 13th tee) back.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus did not see what happened at the 13th tee, but for
those who did, adjectives flowed. And those who heard what
transpired on the 13th tee only added to the ballooning of the Hank
Kuehne Tale.
</P>
<P>
   Woods and Garcia each had taken out their drivers and each had
caught the trees that line the left edge of the 485-yard hole.
``And when it was Hank's turn,'' said Garcia, ``Mark (O'Meara) was
saying, `See those pine trees there. Aww, you can hit it over those
pine trees. Try.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Few golfers attempt this dangerous shot. And, most likely,
Kuehne will not try it once competition begins this morning, but
the amateur pulled out his driver, let loose and his ball flew the
trees and landed far down the left edge of the fairway, no more
than a wedge _ maybe 100 yards _ to the green.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Woods and O'Meara) were kind of joking about it on the tee,''
said Kuehne. ``They were saying, `Knock it over the gap in those
trees.' There's like a little gap there. So I did and I knocked it
over. And they said, `You're supposed to try and hit it over there,
but you're not supposed to be able to do it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   So the ball ended 100 yards from the green?
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like 105,'' said Kuehne. ``It would have been a
wedge.''
</P>
<P>
   As it was, Kuehne's drive was 100 yards farther than O'Meara's,
70 longer than Garcia's, and 60 beyond Woods's. But Kuehne picked
up the ball, played his other practice shot off the tee _ a safe
3-wood to the middle of the fairway _ and flung the ball to the
gallery, which cheered wildly. The crowd began spreading the word
anew that Woods and John Daly might have the reputation but Kuehne
is the one who can drive the ball farther than any of them.
</P>
<P>
   Woods and Kuehne had had a he-man contest off the eighth tee,
the 550-yard par 5 that is perfectly suited for a show of strength.
The fairway is wider than the Savannah River that flows nearby.
Kuehne outdrove Woods by about 25 yards, ``and that was decent,''
said Kuehne. ``That was a decent tee shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods, recounted Kuehne, ``had hit his drive pretty good, and I
was just trying to keep my drive up there but I hit it just a hair
thin. I was just trying to keep it in the fairway, you know?''
</P>
<P>
   Well, good enough to top Woods by 25 yards. ``Naww, it was about
20,'' said Kuehne. ``I pretty much hit it all day long 5 yards, 10
yards by him. Then, on 15, I really got that one.''
</P>
<P>
   Kuehne hits his tee shots so far that Augusta National officals
had to shut him off on the practice tee Monday. A huge screen, 50
feet or higher, some 285 yards from the practice tees, protects
cars along Washington Road from being pelted with golf balls.
Kuehne's drives were going over the screen so often that he was
told to pull back.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made me quit hitting,'' said Kuehne, who'll be playing in
his first Masters. ``So I can't even hit one hard the rest of the
week (off the practice tee).''
</P>
<P>
   As much as his tee shots, Kuehne's personal story once bore a
budding _ and baleful _ resemblance to that of Daly, the huge
hitter who has struggled with alcoholism. Kuehne began his golf
career at Oklahoma State, but was an alcoholic by the end of his
teens, drinking as much as a fifth of whiskey a day with many a
beer for chasers. He was involved in an automobile accident in
Stillwater, Okla., in February 1995 that broke some of his ribs and
injured another person.
</P>
<P>
   He spent time at a rehabilitation clinic in Hazleton, Minn.,
transferred to SMU from Oklahoma State, and reportedly has been
sober since his accident four years ago. Golf buffs are well aware
of the Kuehne family line. His sister Kelli, a two-time US Women's
Amateur champion, is on the LPGA Tour and his brother Trip lost in
that famous US Amateur title match to the charging-from-behind
Woods four years ago. Trip is Hank's caddie here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hank's drive there on 15 was so long,'' said Garcia, ``but he
needs to hit them a little shorter and a little straight.''
</P>
<P>
   In his most recent college golf tourney, Kuehne went 81-76-76 in
the Morris Williams Tournament in Austin, Texas, three weeks ago,
taking a horrendous 36 putts in the round of 81. And putting, not
driving, is the magic elixir at Augusta.
</P>
<P>
   But the loosey-goosey, ever-smiling, ever-laughing Kuehne will
have many an eye on him when he tees it up Thursday. And drives the
ball far, very far.

BUSH SAYS U.S. MUST END GENOCIDE IN YUGOSLAVIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MATT FLORES  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush said Wednesday it was in
America's best interest to ``stop genocide'' in Yugoslavia, but he
cautioned that the United States must have a clear strategy in
ending the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The remarks were the strongest he has used to date in commenting
about the U.S. role in the crisis that has enveloped the Balkan
region of southeastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's in our best interest to stop genocide in the
Balkans,'' said Bush, seemingly underscoring President Clinton's
rationale for U.S. and NATO involvement in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has not announced that he would seek the Republican
presidential nomination in 2000, Bush is seen as the clear
front-runner among a crowded field of announced and potential
candidates within his party.
</P>
<P>
   While he previously had expressed misgivings about the
involvement in NATO-led air raids in Yugoslavia, Bush said America
must be prepared to use whatever force is necessary to end the
conflict that was sparked by the government crackdown on ethnic
Albanians in the province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we engage, we must do so to win,'' Bush said after a
speech at the second annual Texas Charter School Conference in San
Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some principles we must remember ... There must be
an exit strategy, and the president must be clear about our
mission,'' Bush added.
</P>
<P>
   The governor also said he supported strong humanitarian efforts
to help ethnic Albanians refugees who have fled Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Serbia is the dominant republic in Yugoslavia. Kosovo is a
province of Serbia that is dominated by ethnic Albanians. Two weeks
of punishing NATO air raids have failed to bring Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic to the peace table to sign a treaty with the
Albanian population in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who last month established an exploratory committee to
gauge support for his possible candidacy, reiterated that he would
wait until the end of the state's legislative session before making
a final decision on whether he will seek the presidency. The
session ends May 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think most people know I'm very serious about it, but I
still want to go out and see,'' Bush said..
</P>
<P>
   A number of those serving on the committee worked for his
father, President George Bush.

INTERIOR DESIGNER'S WALLS WILL FINALLY SPEAK 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By MITCHELL OWENS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Few outsiders were ever allowed into the private world of Renzo
Mongiardino. Friends and family perhaps, or an associate or two,
would join the legendary interior designer quietly, for long
evening talks or small dinners at his richly moody apartment in
Milan.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, Mongiardino, who died last year at 81, lived a life
of scholarly solitude, surrounded by books, busts and brocades,
attended only by an elderly and singularly uncommunicative Sicilian
housekeeper, who sat in the kitchen, a stern figure in penitential
black, silently darning the maestro's socks.
</P>
<P>
   The mystery ends Friday for admirers who have seen Mongiardino's
work only in photographs in glossy shelter magazines or books like
``Roomscapes'' (Rizzoli, 1993), the professional memoir he wrote in
collaboration with an associate, Fiorenzo Cattaneo.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for all the excitement in Milan next week will be the
annual furniture fair, but many of the visitors to that ground-zero
event will be making a pilgrimage to the dour Palazzo Crivelli, 12
Via Pontaccio, in the center of the city, where Mongiardino's
old-fashioned genius is being feted.
</P>
<P>
   A Milanese auction house, Il Ponte Casa d'Aste, has transformed
five rooms of the 18th-century palace into an evocation of
Mongiardino's apartment, from the gas-blue Genoese wallpaper in his
bedroom to the massive bookcases in his study. The sixth room in
the show is a re-creation of a neoclassical room he designed for an
Italian client.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition opens to the public Friday and runs through
Monday, and will be followed on April 14 and 15 by an auction of
Mongiardino's possessions on display. The 697 lots range from a
half-dozen 19th-century earthenware busts (estimate: $445 to $665)
to an Empire-style stool with crossed-sword legs ($4,450 to
$5,540), designed by Mongiardino in the 1940s after one in the
Louvre. Information about the sale and show can be had by calling
(011) 39-02-72003749.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a celebration,'' said Roberto Peregalli, a former
Mongiardino associate, who conceived the pre-sale show with his
partner, Laura Rimini, a young architect, as a testament to their
mentor's powers.
</P>
<P>
   Even the more eyebrow-raising ones.
</P>
<P>
   In an age when the high-octane decoration of the past seems to
have taken a back seat to do-it-yourself home improvements, it is
surprising to learn of a master decorator whose palatial
romanticism was partly born out of felt-tip pens, burlap and
cardboard. The art of magic, visual and material, was Mongiardino's
forte, the foundation of his reputation as the world's greatest
decorator.
</P>
<P>
   Painted effects were especially associated with the designer,
who had a fondness for the Mannerist movement of early Renaissance
Italy, an era of exaggeration and artifice, when a monumental
surreality reigned supreme. His artisans used paint to create rooms
seemingly made entirely of ceramic tiles, of fragments of Turkish
carpets, of terry-cloth draperies swagged a la ancient Rome.
</P>
<P>
   For Peter Jay Sharp, a New York real estate mogul, Mongiardino,
Cattaneo and an army of Milanese artisans reinterpreted a
15th-century room paved in the wood mosaic known as intarsia. But
the thousands of pieces in Sharp's wall-to-wall panorama of
Manhattan skyline are actually paint on cheap pine boards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any story can be reality if you feel that it is,'' Peregalli
said. ``For Renzo, it was the same for a house.''
</P>
<P>
   And that soulful sense of fantasy is the reason that design
sophisticates flocked to his studio, a group of jet setters once
described as ``a kidnapper's wish list'': Baron Guy de Rothschild,
the banker; Rudolf Nureyev, the ballet idol; Lee Radziwill, the
American socialite; Gianni Versace, fashion's bad boy, and Randolph
Hearst, the publisher.
</P>
<P>
   Mongiardino's singular esthetic _ intensely romantic, vaguely
exotic and as atmospheric as the rooms described by his favorite
novelist, Honore de Balzac _ can also be seen in New York at the
Carlyle Hotel, once owned by Sharp.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, under Mongiardino's direction, the late Gaser Tabakoglu
redecorated the lower and upper galleries with kilim-carpet
banquettes and walls covered in hand-painted paper inspired by the
decorations of the 17th-century seraglio at the Topkapi Palace.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Not every tycoon, however, fell under the spell of Mongiardino's
spectacular tomfoolery. A decade or so ago, the new owner of an
English country house that Mongiardino had decorated was appalled
to discover that his study was not lined with dozens of panels of
ancient flaking Cordova leather but with artfully painted, gilded
and aged cardboard. Horrified by the subterfuge, the chatelain
ordered his new decorator to remove it immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mongiardino was a magician, a maitre de scene,'' said
Peregalli, who calls the designer ``my Socrates.'' ``He didn't
adhere to the alphabet of the past. Instead, he brought the past
into the future. He thought it was possible to continue the
artisanship of earlier centuries by using new techniques and
materials to evoke a moment in time but without reproducing it
exactly.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he was able to recall the details of obscure ceilings in
even more obscure Italian villas at a moment's notice, Mongiardino
was neither an academic nor a curator. A designer of theater and
movie sets by profession _ his work for the 1967 Franco Zeffirelli
movie, ``The Taming of the Shrew,'' which starred Elizabeth Taylor
and Richard Burton, was nominated for an Academy Award _
Mongiardino was an intellectual trawling history for flotsam and
jetsam that were the raw ingredients of his cocoonlike rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Minimalism was not part of his vocabulary. ``It is easier to
create the full room than the empty one,'' he wrote. Like his
friend and fellow esthete Mario Praz, Mongiardino had a weakness
for the past, the dustier and more cluttered, the better.
</P>
<P>
   ```Make it more like Proust, more like Balzac, more like
d'Annunzio,''' Peregalli said, recalling his late boss'
literary-minded directives to his staff.
</P>
<P>
   Mongiardino grew up in the splendor of a Genoese palace owned by
his father, a theatrical impresario who introduced color television
to Italy, and it was this house, with its shadowy spaces, glinting
gilt frames and mysterious scents _ dying lilies, faint feminine
perfumes, a bit of wet dog _ that infused his work.
</P>
<P>
   Strangely, for all the glamour associated with Mongiardino,
there is a sadness and isolation _ or self-reflection _ that
permeated his creations, a quietude that evoked ``the corrosive
breath of melancholy,'' Umberto Pasti, a friend of designer, wrote
in the auction catalog.
</P>
<P>
   His rooms were grand, certainly, with all the chandeliers and
damasks that the word implies. But as the exhibition at the Palazzo
Crivelli will doubtless prove, there was also a darker side to the
designer's vision, a sense of something left unfinished,
unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   Mongiardino's spaces _ his own and those created for others _
are expectant, waiting for something momentous to happen: a knock
at the door, a love letter read with a shaking hand. To stand in
one is to be a protagonist in an unfolding drama, in a theater
without a stage or audience.
</P>
<P>
   Few details of Mongiardino's personal life are known, outside of
a youthful liaison with his mother's maid that resulted in the
birth of his only child. In his catalog essay, Pasti refers
pointedly to an unpublished short story that Mongiardino wrote in
the 1940s and apparently continued to revise until his death.
</P>
<P>
   It is the tale of a manservant driven to suicide by his
homosexual desires in a palazzo identical to the one of the
designer's Genoese childhood, a place, Mongiardino wrote, ``where
the crystal chandelier sparkled, reflecting the sun's last rays,
which the terrazzo floor gathered into small pools as the rest of
the room sank into darkness.''
</P>
<P>
   While it might be simplistic to sift the meaning of his
decorative vision through the prism of sexuality, he was
nonetheless conscious of the importance of the sad gentility of
that house on his work, especially its entrance hall, its heart,
where his mother took tea, his father exercised, and Mongiardino
and his elder sister played games.
</P>
<P>
   ``My love for architecture probably was born in that room, and
without realizing it, I understood that everything in our lives
takes place within a space that surrounds us, therefore within
architecture,'' he once wrote. ``Even when we are in the woods, the
woods are our architecture; the light that passes among the trees
is the same light that illuminates the chandelier of my
childhood.''
</P>
<P>
   For a few days this week and next, in Milan, the chandelier of
the designer's childhood will scatter the sunlight again, before
being finally extinguished, one bust and chair at a time, until, in
the end, nothing will be left, and the sales rooms of the Palazzo
Crivelli will be empty. Paradoxically, it is the sort of poignant
moment that Mongiardino might have used as a creative springboard.
``Make it more like me,'' he might have said. ``Make it more like
me.''

 By DIANA BUTLER BASS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    During the Easter service at our Episcopal parish, my
17-month-old daughter escaped from our pew. Emma ran up and down
the aisle waving at each stained glass window and babbled happily,
``Hi Jesus! Hi Jesus!''
 &HT;    Her exuberance over the resurrection prompted giggles from even
the most stodgy of our fellow parishioners.
 &HT;    When her father returned her to her seat, she was still chatting
with Jesus in the windows. How does she know that is Jesus? Elmo
and Tinky Winky I can understand --they have videos. But Jesus?
 &HT;    Nearly every Sunday since she was born, Emma has attended church
and was baptized at three months. No wonder she recognizes Jesus.
She has heard about him her whole life.
 &HT;    When it comes to religion, some theologians have argued that
``geography is destiny.'' If you are born in a Christian country,
you will most likely be a Christian. An Islamic one, a Muslim. A
Buddhist nation, a Buddhist. And so for Emma: born of Protestant
parents in the United States, she is being shaped by Christianity.
 &HT;    In spite of growing multiculturalism, the major world religions
still dominate much the same geographical territory as in previous
centuries: Christianity dominates Europe and the Americas; Islam
holds the Middle East and North Africa; Hinduism, south Asia;
Buddhism, southeastern and eastern Asia.
 &HT;    The major regional shifts have been three: the decline of tribal
religions in South America and southern Africa, the creation of
Israel as a Jewish nation, and increased religious pluralism in
urbanized areas across the globe.
 &HT;    Historically, conflict occurs where religious regions touch.
Border areas between faiths are places of intense rivalry and
warfare. Religion gets mixed up with politics, manifest destiny and
nationalism. In these cases, religion justifies, and sometimes
creates, the conditions for violence.
 &HT;    So it is in Yugoslavia. Three historic religions meet in this
small area -- Roman Catholic western Europe, Eastern Orthodox
southern Europe and Russia, and the Islamic Mediterranean. For 2000
years, this area has traded political hands as a crossroads of
three great world religions.
 &HT;    The current conflict between Serbia and its neighbors comes as
no surprise. The Serbs are Orthodox; the Croatians, Roman Catholic;
and the Kosovo Albanians, Muslim. According to conventional wisdom,
religious conflict is inevitable -- maybe even a defect of Balkan
religious fanaticism.
 &HT;    But Yugoslavia has often defied conventional wisdom. The people
of the Balkans, the southern Slavs, have not always been at war.
They have experienced extended periods of multireligious
cooperation. For centuries, Catholic and Orthodox churches existed
alongside Islamic mosques and created a unique European religious
society long before contemporary multiculturalism.
 &HT;    Unlike their northern European neighbors, who lived in
religiously isolated nations, the Slavs learned to live with
difference. For them, geography meant a destiny of religious
pluralism -- but not necessarily conflict.
 &HT;    On occasion, pluralism resulted in conflict. Balkan
multiculturalism failed when one of the religious cultures asserted
itself against the others. But when Catholic, Orthodox, and Islamic
parties shared power or when an outside group (such as the Ottomans
or the Communists) enforced religious balance, the groups at least
tolerated each other.
 &HT;    Beginning in 1989, ascendant Serbs upset this balance. Serbia
reinvented itself as the persecuted embodiment of Christ and their
Muslim neighbors as ``Christ killers.'' They pursued a policy of
``ethnic cleansing,'' a euphemism for an Orthodox Holy War against
Islam. Militarily strong enough to enforce this program, Serbia
began to ``purify'' their society of religious undesirables and
consolidate national power.
 &HT;    Steeped in our own religious prejudices, the United States and
Europe have been slow to act in the Balkans -- clearly reluctant to
defend Muslims and condemn their Christian oppressors. However,
with this NATO action, the historic Roman Catholic and Protestant
western countries have finally sided with Muslims against the
Orthodox Serbs.
 &HT;    Not since the Crusades has a western Christian alliance
conducted such an intense military campaign -- with such overt
moral and religious overtones -- against an Eastern Orthodox
country. Pleas from Yugoslavia to stop the bombing during Eastern
Orthodox Holy Week (coming one week later than western
Christianity) met with even less sympathy than pleas from Iraq to
stop bombing their nation during Ramadan.
 &HT;    As a Christian, I grieve for innocent Serbians suffering during
this holy time. I do not, however, grieve for their guilty leaders
who, in a perversion of Orthodox Christianity, have murdered their
neighbors. While the bombs fall, I pray for the Yugoslavia that
once existed: a place where people of many faiths lived as
neighbors. If that multireligious culture is completely destroyed,
its ruins stand as a sad warning to all of us. Perhaps from the
ashes of Belgrade, we might yet see the resurrection.
 &HT;    I hope so. With religious multiculturalism increasing around the
world, Yugoslavian geography -- for good or for ill -- might be
destiny for us all.

   KIBEHO, Rwanda _ The floor of the church is now covered with
moss. The burnt-out roof is open to the sky, and in a macabre
memorial just down the hill, the corpses of people who died are now
mummified, lying twisted on shelves, some with rosaries around
their necks.
</P>
<P>
   It was five years ago Wednesday that thousands of Tutsi, one of
two major ethnic groups in Rwanda, gathered at the church here,
afraid of bands of Hutu who had begun an attempt at genocide. In
100 days, more than 500,000 Tutsi died around Rwanda, several
thousand of them here.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the leaders of Rwanda came here to give some of
the dead a proper burial, in the biggest of several memorial
services around the nation. Corpses were placed into coffins draped
with purple cloth and interred in four brick-lined pits, the same
pits where the bodies were buried by their killers five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's respect we are giving them,'' said Selestin Ntubwiriza,
50, a farmer who hid at the church in April 1994 and escaped. His
two wives and nine children did not survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't just leave our sisters and brothers where they were
scattered,'' he said. ``It's also a lesson to those who did it
never to do it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Kibeho was one of hundreds of places around the country where
well-organized bands of Hutu militia attacked their Tutsi
neighbors, mostly hacking them to death. But Kibeho holds a
distinct place in the lore of the genocide. Since the late 1970s,
villagers say they have seen apparitions of the Virgin Mary near a
soccer field on a hilltop.
</P>
<P>
   Before the genocide, the Virgin, believers say, predicted that
the hills would flow with blood. A month afterward, it was reported
on radio around Rwanda that the Virgin Mary had appeared to claim
Rwanda's Hutu President, Juvenal Habyarimana, who died when his
plane was shot down.
</P>
<P>
   The radio report was interpreted as an attempt by the Hutu
government to justify the killings. The Virgin never appeared
again, villagers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why,'' said Innocent Ruganintwari, 42, who
survived the church massacres. ``Maybe it's because so much blood
was spilled here.''
</P>
<P>
   Kibeho is also where, in April 1995, Tutsi-led government troops
cleared a huge refugee camp they claimed was full of Hutu
extremists. Human rights officials say that at least 4,000 Hutu
were killed, many shot and many trampled.
</P>
<P>
   There was no official mention of that incident Wednesday, but
President Pasteur Bizimungu told a crowd of several thousand people
that Rwandans must unite against ``injustice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We must come together to say no to another genocide,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bizimungu raised the issue of NATO airstrikes against
Yugoslavia, asking the difference between the ``ethnic cleansing''
of Kosovo Albanians and the eradication of one group of Rwandans
because of their ethnicity.
</P>
<P>
   Many in Rwanda remain bitter that outside nations did nothing to
stop the killings in 1994, and Bizimungu used that failure to
justify Rwanda's intervention in the war in Congo, where remnants
of Hutu militias are fighting on the side of Congo's president,
Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
   ``Outsiders, especially Europeans, ask us what we are doing in
Congo,'' he said. ``But I tell you, those who started the genocide,
most of them are in the Congo. Most of those who killed are in
Congo.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd was mostly Tutsi, but one of the men who helped lower
the coffins into the graves was a Hutu hotel worker, Kome
Rukeribuga. He jumped down into the pits, still covered with the
clothes of the dead, along with the others to settle the coffins
into their resting place.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives the families respect,'' he said. ``The way these
people were killed, they were chopped up and put into these
holes.''

   Q: Help settle an argument: Were the Warner brothers really
brothers? _ S.P., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: Warner Bros., now part of Time-Warner, was founded by
siblings Albert, Harry, Jack and Sam Warner in 1923.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Warner died in 1927 only hours before the studio released
``The Jazz Singer,'' the first film with synchronized dialogue and
music.
</P>
<P>
   Warner Bros. became a major studio with the introduction of
talking pictures, producing 100 films a year in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   After his brothers retired, Jack Warner became company president
in 1956 and was actively working in production until 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Warner wasn't the family's birth name: The father, Benjamin

<P>
   Q: Where does the song lyric ``aba daba daba daba daba daba daba
said the monkey to the chimp'' come from? _ V.T., Arlington, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: That's from ``Aba Daba Honeymoon,'' a 1914 song by Arthur
Fields and Walter Donovan that has been used in several movies.
</P>
<P>
   The popular vaudeville song appears in 1930's ``King of Jazz.''
Composer Saul Chaplin remembered the song 20 years later, turning
it into a duet for Debbie Reynolds and Carleton Carpenter in ``Two
Weeks With Love.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the lyrics, ``aba daba daba'' means either ``monk I
love but you'' or ``chimp I love you too.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Aba Daba Honeymoon'' is included on several song compilations:
``Best of Debbie Reynolds, Top Movie Hits _ 1950-1954'' and
``Golden Age of Hollywood.''

   Q: Where can I send a letter to Yankees manager Joe Torre? _
L.A.O., via the Internet
</P>
<P>
   A: Write to Torre in care of the New York Yankees, Yankee
Stadium, Bronx, NY 10451.
</P>
<P>
   Torre, 58, took a leave of absence from the team in March for
treatment of prostate cancer. His illness was discovered during
team-mandated tests that followed Yankees player Darryl
Strawberry's colon cancer diagnosis in October 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In three years, Torre has led the Yankees to a 302-184 record
and two World Series championships. He previously managed the New
York Mets, Atlanta Braves and St. Louis Cardinals.  &QL;

   The New York Times News Service calls to your attention a
package of stories from  &UR; Cox News Service &LR;  marking the 25th
anniversary of Hank Aaron's home run record.
</P>
<P>
   On April 8, 1974, in Atlanta, his home stadium, Aaron hit his
715th home run, to pass Babe Ruth as baseball's all-time greatest
home run hitter.
</P>
<P>
   The stories recount Aaron's career and his life since retiring
from the Braves, recall the national fascination leading up to his
record and tell what has become of the ball, bat and uniform.
</P>
<P>
   The stories are accompanied by photos, including a recent color
portrait, which are available to subscribers to the New York Times
News Service photo and graphic service (nonsubscribers can arrange

   THE HEALING OF FORGIVENESS
</P>
<P>
   Fear, revenge, jealousy, anger, prejudice. Lord God, these human
dispositions brought Jesus to the cross and to his death. They
stoke the flames of violence and destroy the bonds that would draw
mankind together today. The players are different, but the scene
appears painfully familiar: power threatened by a challenge to its
authority and a critique of its methods, and the consequence _ one
people stirred up against another to eliminate the threat. When, Oh
God, will we ever learn?
</P>
<P>
   Memories and imagination. They are the excuses that justify
human behavior that could bring peoples together for peace. Why do
we so easily hold onto hurts caused generations and centuries ago
and fail to recall the forgiveness extended to us by a God who
forgets our evil at a word? Serbs and Muslims. Whites and blacks.
North and South. Jews and Christians. Arabs and Israelis. Catholics
and Protestants. Will we ever learn, Oh God?
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time, God, you created us as one people. We
disobeyed you and went our own way. You sent prophets and plagues
to remind us of our inability. You sent your Son to show us how to
reconcile and live in peace. We continue to forget the good offered
to us by you as we refuse to forget the evils done to us by others.
We cannot heal ourselves. We cannot resolve our differences by
force or violence. Unless we turn to you, however we understand
you, all this destruction will continue. Have mercy on us, Oh God,
and do to us what we cannot do to ourselves. Heal our memories.
Soothe our pains, and make us once more a people to give you praise
and serve each other in peace.

   DIGNITY FOR ALL GOD'S CHILDREN
</P>
<P>
   Oh God, recalling the exodus from Egypt at this season of
Passover, we pray for freedom and dignity for all your children
everywhere. This year especially we pray for those who suffer in
and around Kosovo. May they soon, once again, know peace.
</P>
<P>
   As our ancestors reached the far shores of the sea and the
waters closed over the Egyptians, according to Jewish lore, the
heavenly hosts burst into song. You chastised them: ``My children
are drowning, and you sing praises?'' We cannot rejoice, Oh Lord,
as the bombs fall. Yet we know that liberty and human dignity must
be fought for, and that if no one stands up against evil, evil
triumphs.
</P>
<P>
   Master of history, too often otherwise decent people have said
little and done less as innocent populations have been slaughtered.
The Holocaust still haunts our dreams. We rejoice that this time in
Kosovo, America and its NATO allies have had the courage and
fortitude to stand against ethnic cleansing.
</P>
<P>
   Be with our American soldiers and their allies. Return them to
our homes and loved ones safely. Fill the hearts of refugees and
innocent victims on all sides with strength and hope, but confound
the plans of those who plot evil.
</P>
<P>
   May the day come speedily when peoples of every religion, race
and nation will learn to live together in mutual respect. Then
shall you reign in justice, peace and love. Amen.

   SHOWER MERCY ON KOSOVO
</P>
<P>
   All praise be to Allah, the cherisher and sustainer of worlds.
Most gracious. Most merciful. Master of the day of judgment. You
alone we worship and you alone we seek for help. Guide us to the
straight path, the path of those on whom you have bestowed your
grace, those whose portion is not wrath, and who go not astray.
Amen.
</P>
<P>
   There is no god but Allah. To him belongs all sovereignty and
praise. Oh Allah, none can prevent what you have willed to bestow
and none can bestow what you have willed to prevent. Oh Allah, it
is your mercy that we hope for. We place you before our enemies and
take refuge in you from their evils. Oh Allah, you're our support
and helper. Protect us from all evils and guide us in all our
endeavors.
</P>
<P>
   Oh Allah, there is no ease except that which you make easy. Oh
Allah, make easy the affairs of the people of Kosovo and all those
in pain. Relieve them from all their distress and hardship. Give
them patience and assist them to overcome their problems. Shower
your mercy upon them. Oh Allah, recompense them for their
affliction and replace for them whatever they have lost. Answer our
call, for none can assist them except you, the Almighty.
</P>
<P>
   Oh Allah, the creator of everything, our Lord, keep the hearts
of the oppressed and the afflicted from deviating from your path
after you have guided them aright. Grant them mercy and love from
your presence. Oh Allah, guide and assist our leaders to serve and
make prudent decisions for truth and justice for all people. All
praise belongs to you, the Lord of all worlds. Amen.

   SHELTER IN THE TIME OF NEED
</P>
<P>
   Our Father, I lay to you the dilemmas abroad. Father, I know you
have control over everything; I know that you have demonstrated
your awesome power time and time again. Master, we recognize that
in your word it speaks of wars and rumors of wars, but Lord, your
help is desperately needed.
</P>
<P>
   My God, we ask for hearts to be touched, minds to be opened, and
love to be expressed through the leadership of NATO and our
country. Our Father, we pray to you to show everyone that there is
a way to solve the problems besetting Kosovo. Show them, God, you
can work it out; you and only you can bring peace.
</P>
<P>
   Now, my Father, many are homeless, without food and fleeing to
safety. I ask that you provide protection for them; be shelter for
them; be a supplier during their time of need.
</P>
<P>
   My God, watch over the troops. See about innocent civilians.
Provide safety for them as well. Now, Father, I know that all
things work together for good, so I leave it all in your care. I
close this prayer knowing that you are a keeper and you will make
everything all right.
</P>
<P>
   This I pray in your Son's name. Amen.

   REPLACING HATRED WITH LOVE
</P>
<P>
   Oh God, our creator, who has placed in us a wondrously ordered
harmony, within which life flourishes, and whose shalom is always a
possibility _ we are deeply saddened and greatly perplexed at the
dominating presence of hatred in your creation.
</P>
<P>
   We are especially aware of the violence in Kosovo and the
destruction that hate brings. We ask your blessing on refugees and
those who work with them, on the peace process and those who seek
to negotiate it.
</P>
<P>
   We pray for the healing of nations, because we know this is your
desire. We know that you hate nothing you have made, and we pray
for us that same spirit of compassion.
</P>
<P>
   I, also, pray for myself, that hatred will be pushed out of my
life by love. My concern for Kosovo must begin with me, so I commit
now to being vigilant against hate in myself. In whatever place I
have an effect, I pledge my life to be an instrument of your peace.
Amen.

BUMPER CRANBERRY CROP DEALS OCEAN SPRAY A SETBACK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: Wis., Mich., Ore.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Back-to-back surplus harvests have taken a toll on the
country's cranberry industry, driving down prices nationwide and
leading to another round of layoffs locally.
</P>
<P>
   Ocean Spray Cranberries Inc. said Wednesday it plans to cut 100
jobs at its Lakeville headquarters by the end of the month, the
latest sign the cranberry business is in turmoil. At a time when
surplus harvests have driven down prices for the entire industry,
The layoff is the grower cooperative's third since mid-1997.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, those three layoffs will downsize Ocean Spray's
work force by 500 jobs, 335 of which are in Massachusetts
operations. Two years ago, Ocean Spray employed 2,600 workers.
</P>
<P>
   When its latest round of cuts goes into effect, Ocean Spray will
employ 1,900 workers, including 600 at its headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Another 200 jobs have been eliminated through attrition and
early retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts, the second-largest cranberry growing state behind
Wisconsin, is estimated to employ 5,500 workers in the cranberry
industry; they earn a total of about $200 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in memory, Ocean Spray has also suspended
1999 redemption payments to some growers looking to cash out Ocean
Spray stock. That decision has hurt some older growers who were
counting on the payments to help finance retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it's illegal, but I think it's immoral,'' said
Cape Cod cranberry grower Dave McCarthy.
</P>
<P>
   Growers who belong to the cooperative are required to buy stock.
Traditionally, when growers leave the cooperative, Ocean Spray buys
back the stock over five years in annual installments. It is a
tradition that regrettably and temporarily has to be suspended due
to tough times, said Ocean Spray, which claims to be under no legal
obligation to make payments within a certain time frame.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy, 60, said he expected to receive a check for nearly
$45,000 from Ocean Spray on Feb. 28, but on Feb. 27 he learned he
would not receive a check this year.
</P>
<P>
   After 20 years as an Ocean Spray grower, McCarthy left the
cooperative in 1995. He said he is still owed about $135,000.
</P>
<P>
   Ocean Spray president and chief executive Thomas E. Bullock
defended the austerity measures as necessary for Ocean Spray to
survive a difficult period and to retool itself to adjust to a
highly competitive marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``The price of cranberries has dropped like a rock,'' said
Bullock, who added: ``A lot of people are upset. It's a tough time
for the cranberry industry.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, Ocean Spray's market share of the supermarket
juice aisle dropped from 70 to 60 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, record harvests have hurt an entire industry.
Basically, North American growers have been harvesting about 7
million barrels of cranberries per year for the last two years, but
consumers are eating or drinking only about 5 million barrels'
worth of cranberry products, said David Farrimond, executive
director of the Cranberry Marketing Committee, a part of the US
Department of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   ``A surplus is a farmer's worst nightmare,'' said John Decas,
president of Decas Cranberry Co. in Wareham. ``There are just too
many damn berries.''
</P>
<P>
   Growers harvest cranberries in 100-pound barrels. In 1996, some
growers earned as much as $85 a barrel. For berries that will be
harvested this fall, barrel prices could fall to between $42 and
$48, or even lower.
</P>
<P>
   One reason Ocean Spray formed in 1930 was to protect growers
from volatile price fluctuations that affect many other crops. By
setting a yearly barrel price, the cooperative looks to smooth out
a feast-or-famine cycle for growers.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two decades, Ocean Spray has also had great success
in marketing the cranberry. There were ad campaigns with themes
like ``Crave the wave,'' and scientific studies that claimed
cranberries were good for some women with bladder complaints.
Together, these efforts transformed a Thanksgiving condiment into
the makings of a popular juice drink.
</P>
<P>
   But in creating demand for the cranberry, Ocean Spray may also
have created rivals who saw a bonanza in fruit drinks.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, after a drought shrank demand and sent
prices soaring, many farmers in Quebec turned to the cranberry.
</P>
<P>
   Ocean Spray also saw competition from Northland Cranberries Inc.
of Wisconsin, the first publicly traded cranberry company.
</P>
<P>
   (Amid tough times, Northland has seen its stock take a beating
in the last year. Shares have dropped from just above 19 last May
to 7 Wednesday, near a 52-week low.)
</P>
<P>
   With all that surplus, Ocean Spray can be underpriced by
supermarket store brands at the same time it feels the squeeze from
juice brands owned by big conglomerates such as Coca-Cola Co.
(Minute Maid) and PepsiCo Inc. (Tropicana).
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, a 64-ounce bottle of cranberry juice could sell in a
supermarket for about $2.48; now those same bottles can be two for
$3, said Farrimond of the Cranberry Marketing Committee.
</P>
<P>
   One might think consumers would now see cranberry juice as a
bargain, but lower prices haven't increased consumption, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the surge in sales of juice drinks in the early 1990s,
consumption has leveled off, added Gary A. Hemphill, vice president
of Beverage Marketing Corp., a consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps consumers prefer something else at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Ocean Spray doesn't compete just with other cranberry
companies, but with almost anyone who sells beverages _ from orange
juice to soda to iced tea and bottled water.
</P>
<P>
   For the fiscal year that ended Aug. 31, Ocean Spray reported
sales of $1.48 billion, an increase of 3 percent. Proceeds, the
word that cooperatives use for profits, were $280 million, up from
$273 million.
</P>
<P>
   Ocean Spray warned that troubles in the cranberry industry could
hurt proceeds for the current fiscal year _ and this at a time when
Ocean Spray is looking for a new distributor to deliver its
single-serve products to convenience stores.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the fiscal year, 808 cranberry growers and 121
grapefruit growers belonged to the co-op, Ocean Spray said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Ocean Spray remains bullish on the cranberry.
</P>
<P>
   It thinks sales overseas will continue to grow and that once
Ocean Spray becomes leaner and more focused, it will regain
momentum when cranberry prices stabilize.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to be optimistic,'' president Bullock said.
</P>
<P>
   No severance package has yet been formulated for the Ocean Spray
workers who will lose their jobs, but a spokesman said, ``We treat
people fairly and with dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it could be a year of hardship for many in the business.
David Gradt of Bandon, Ore., may be a case in point.
</P>
<P>
   A retired grower, Gradt said he lost a loan application for a
new home recently because Ocean Spray didn't send him a redemption
payment he expected to receive for the stock he accumulated over
his 18 years as an Ocean Spray co-op member.
</P>
<P>
   Gradt said he has heart trouble and was looking to move closer
to his cardiologist in Portland, nearly 300 miles away. But without
the money he was counting on from Ocean Spray, he said couldn't buy
a new house. Gradt, 59, said he continues to live on the cranberry
farm he has already sold.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not only out the Ocean Spray money, but we're out the
rent we're paying on the house we once owned,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of troubles in the cranberry industry, ``a one-year
hiatus'' on Ocean Spray's stock-redemption payments is a
regrettable necessity, Bullock said.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy, the Cape Cod grower, estimated that there are about 55
growers in the same fix as he and Gradt find themselves. Will they
receive a check from Ocean Spray next year? they wonder. And why
should they take a hit when Ocean Spray's proceeds _ or profits _
have risen for its last three fiscal years?
</P>
<P>
   ``What will happen next year, I don't know,'' Bullock said when
asked when growers such as McCarthy and Gradt can expect to receive
payment for their stock.

<P>
   PODGORICA, Montenegro _ After a week without air attacks here,
NATO warplanes fired on a Yugoslav army missile battery in this
tiny Yugoslav republic on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The attack came after a Yugoslav army missile was fired at NATO
airplanes that were flying over the republic on the way to bombing
runs in neighboring Kosovo, according to a State Department
official in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in the pro-Western Montenegrin government Wednesday
agreed with Washington's version of events, saying that NATO had
hit four military targets near the capital, causing no civilian
casualties and no significant damage to civilian property. The
officials said NATO planes launched missiles and bombs after they
came under fire from Yugoslav army anti-aircraft weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav 2nd Army in Montenegro, which is loyal to the
regime of the Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic, and has about
12,000 troops here, announced that NATO's missiles and bombs were
aimed at civilian targets in the city. The twisted metal remains of
what appeared, by its English language markings, to be a NATO
missile were seen by Western reporters in a residential
neighborhood in the center of Podgorica on Tuesday night. An
explosion there broke a few windows, but caused no other damage.
</P>
<P>
   The army here did not provide any information on damage to its
facilities, but a State Department official said a Yugoslav missile
launcher was destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Attacks on Montenegro have caused severe political problems for
President Milo Djukanovic, who was elected in 1997 by promising
voters that a turn to the West would bring Montenegro peace and
wealth.
</P>
<P>
   This poor mountainous republic, with a population of only about
640,000, is part of Yugoslavia, but is split between those who
support Djukanovic's shift to the West and those who believe that
Montenegrins should be loyal to their Serbian Orthodox brothers and
back the Milosevic regime in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   NATO bombings seem to have tipped the popular balance, for the
moment, at least, against Djukanovic. He and his ministers have
been on the defensive for the past two weeks. After a meeting last
Friday with army generals, government officials here agreed to
major changes in state and private television coverage of the war
in Kosovo. They issued orders that have eliminated nearly all
rebroadcasts of reports from CNN and western TV news networks.
</P>
<P>
   The bombings have also revivified the pro-Milosevic Socialist
People's Party, which was soundly beaten last year in parliamentary
elections. The party Wednesday night staged its fourth consecutive
pro-army, anti-NATO concert here.
</P>
<P>
   After the concert, several thousand noisy supporters of the
pro-Milosevic party, many of them waving a vulgar fictional
obituary of Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, marched from the
city's central square toward nearby government buildings. The crowd
broke up peacefully before reaching the government center.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Gelbard, the U.S. special envoy to the former Yugoslavia,
said in a telephone interview from Washington that the Clinton
administration is in regular contact with Djukanovic, explaining to
him why the NATO attacks have occurred on Montenegrin soil and
reassuring him of U.S. support for his government.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the very beginning of this campaign, we knew and we let
Djukanovic know, that there were certain minimal military targets
that we were going to have to hit in Montenegro, and he was well
aware of it,'' Gelbard said. ``The only time that we have actually
targeted ground installations in Montenegro was on the first and
second day of the campaign.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Gelbard added that he has told Djukanovic on several occasions,
including during a telephone conversation Wednesday, that while
there are no more planned targets in Montenegro, if missiles are
fired at NATO aircraft or if they are caught in Yugoslav ground
radar, then NATO will respond.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on Sunday night, Djukanovic said that he had
argued for months with the Americans that a bombing attack on
Yugoslavia would weaken his government and raise the willingness of
pro-Milosevic forces here to try to stage a coup. Djukanovic was
highly critical of Milosevic in the interview, but stopped short of
declaring that he wanted Montenegro to secede from Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts here agree that the bombing has firmed up
support for Milosevic and that any referendum on secession would
fail by an overwhelming margin.
</P>
<P>
   A three-member film crew for German television was detained here
on Tuesday night by army forces while filming near an army base
where one of the explosions had set some woods on fire. Five
members of a British television crew, including one American, were
also detained Wednesday by army troops near the Montenegrin town of
Niksic.
</P>
<P>
   The Montenegrin government, in sharp contrast to the authorities
in Belgrade, has welcomed foreign journalists. But the welcome ends
when reporters come across members of the Yugoslav army. Those
troops have detained at least six television crews in the past two
weeks, taking away all their equipment and, in several cases,
taking their cars.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Everyone wore black, and many wore long, tapered
gunslinger's jackets as they paid sartorial tribute, as much as
anything else, to Johnny Cash in a concert at the Hammerstein
Ballroom on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Until the last minute it was an open question whether Cash
himself would perform. In 1997 Shy-Drager syndrome, a neurological
disorder related to Parkinson's disease, was diagnosed, and Cash,
67, has been absent from stages for 19 months.
</P>
<P>
   The advertisements for the concert, which was taped for a TNT
``Masters Series'' special, did not indicate that he would attend,
and no reference was made to his impending appearance during the
two-and-a-half-hour proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Antithetical to the haunted, solitary nature of Cash's songs,
the production was nearly as Hollywood as New York gets. Actor Jon
Voight was the host, and introductions were read off a prompter by
Kevin Bacon and Tim Robbins.
</P>
<P>
   But the music was remarkably full-hearted despite numerous
retakes, sometimes of entire songs, for the cameras. Part of that
stemmed from the bar-band gusto of the Mavericks, acting as the
house band. And part of it arose from many striking versions of
Cash's simple, moving songs.
</P>
<P>
   June Carter Cash, Cash's wife, took the stage with an Autoharp
for a high point of the evening. She sang the 1963 song ``Ring of
Fire,'' reminding the audience that Cash wrote it when they first
fell in love. ``It's a scary song,'' she said. ``And he was kind of
scary at that time.''
</P>
<P>
   The song is practically a license requirement for
alternative-country bands, and somewhere along the way it has been
remade as a party tune. Ms. Cash, backed by Don Herron on fiddle
and Marty Stuart on guitar, sang it with a thin, wavering mountain
voice, bringing it back to an exhilarated, slightly paranoid poem
about losing control of one's emotions.
</P>
<P>
   U2, in Dublin while recording a new album, was represented by
its video performance of a reggae version of ``Don't Take Your Guns
to Town,'' which was followed by a film clip detailing Cash's
humanitarian work on behalf of American Indians and convicts.
</P>
<P>
   It noted that he performed for soldiers in Asia during the
Vietnam War, even though he opposed the war, and described Cash as
a man who never ``let principles stand in the way of compassion.''
The Mavericks played ``The Man in Black,'' devoted to supporting
the underdog.
</P>
<P>
   Kris Kristofferson performed Cash's ``Ballad of Ira Hayes,''
about an American Indian marine who helped raise the flag at Iwo
Jima; a marine stood behind him during the song and played taps at
the end. Then Trisha Yearwood sang Kristofferson's dissipation
anthem, ``Sunday Morning Coming Down.'' (Her typically wholesome
presentation made one wonder whether she could ever be found
drinking beer for breakfast, as the song's narrator does.)
</P>
<P>
   Brooks and Dunn, the super-successful duo of new country, played
``Ghost Riders in the Sky,'' strenuously mugging and grimacing;
more sincerely, Lyle Lovett sang Cash's sweet small-town song,
``Tennessee Flat-Top Box.'' Bruce Springsteen, touring in Italy,
sent in a video clip. He praised Cash for tearing up boundaries,
saying he combined ``the social consciousness from folk, the
gravity and humor from country and the rebellion from rock,'' and
played Cash's ``Give My Love to Rose'' alone on the acoustic
guitar, investing it with the best quiet earnestness he had.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Dylan, also appearing on film, offered a wonderfully
tossed-off band version of Cash's early song ``Train of Love''; he
took its word-stuffed chorus and raced through it, reshuffling its
accents as only he can.
</P>
<P>
   Wyclef Jean of the Fugees, with a guitar, black cowboy hat and
accompanied by a bassist, sang Cash's recent ballad about murder,
``Delia's Gone,'' in a surprisingly straight version, until he
placed the action of the song in Brooklyn and flowed into a rap
about being picked up in a Bentley. Dave Matthews performed ``Long
Black Veil,'' locating the desolation in the song, and was helped
by Emmylou Harris' backup vocals.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins, whose slicked-back hair and black suit made him look
like the young Cash, read an excerpt from the ``Johnny Cash at
Folsom Prison'' liner notes, a description of the experience of
being a prisoner. Then the lights rose on Cash standing still and
calm at center stage, in a black jacket with black stitching,
looking a bit puffy. ``Hello, I'm Johnny Cash,'' he said, giving
his customary honest-fellow introduction and facing lights and
cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in front of a quartet that included the bass player
Marshall Grant and the drummer W.S. Holland _ original members of
the Tennessee Three, his late-'50s band _ he thanked Sam Phillips
of Sun Records for giving him his first break and Don Law, his
first producer at Columbia, for artistic freedom.
</P>
<P>
   He admitted that he was astounded by the ``stretch of the
arrangements'' in the tribute concert, and mentioned that he had
not performed in a long time. ``Feels good, feels good, feels
good,'' he muttered; he introduced the musicians, and that was it
for small talk.
</P>
<P>
   What could he sing but ``Folsom Prison Blues''? He sang it
gamely, without much energy but in the same commanding low voice as
ever. Scratching out the dead-string chords of its introduction, he
followed with ``I Walk the Line.'' What could happen next but a
full-cast sing-along? The show, predictable but with brilliant
patches, will be on TNT on April 18 at 8 p.m.

AS FLORIDA'S RETIREE NUMBERS DWINDLE, SO DOES DEMOCRATIC VOTING
STRENGTH 
</HEADLINE>
  (ac) 
 By RICK BRAGG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Their accents have not faded, even after decades in the
Florida sun. It has been years since they worked on the Newark
docks, pressed shirts in New York City or argued with their
delegate in a Brooklyn union hall, but passersby can hear echoes of
Flatbush in Sam's deli in Deerfield Beach, or the Bronx on a
Broward County boardwalk.
</P>
<P>
   It is what Democrats sound like.
</P>
<P>
   These blue collar workers, office workers and small business
owners retired to South Florida condominiums during the booms of
the 1960s and 1970s, and brought their machine politics with them.
They used their condo associations and social clubs the way they
once used the meeting halls, synagogues and church basements back
home, shifting from Roosevelt, Truman and Kennedy to Carter and
Clinton, becoming a steady, swelling political force. They voted
religiously, and they voted Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me tell you, the Republican Party never did a thing for
you, me, or anybody else of our caliber,'' said Miriam Radow, a
secretary from Brooklyn who retired here in 1976 and became part of
that New Deal Democrat stronghold in northern Miami-Dade and
Broward counties.
</P>
<P>
   But with all their influence, in the State Legislature, in
Washington, in city hall, they never got anyone to build them the
thing they needed most.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fountain of Youth,'' said Mrs. Radow.
</P>
<P>
   While their New York and New Jersey accents still buzz in the
cabanas, poker rooms and shuffleboard courts, their political voice
is fading. The New Deal Democrats are dying out, being replaced in
the condominiums by Hispanics, Caribbean blacks, American blacks,
Canadians, European immigrants and younger, working people who
moved here from other parts of the country, said political experts
who have studied the change.
</P>
<P>
   It is more than merely a changing political and social
demographic in communities like Sunrise, Hallandale, Lauderdale
Lakes, Deerfield Beach and other places where most of the New York
area's retirees settled, bringing their socially liberal attitudes
on issues like abortion rights, gun control and taxes. It was these
tens of thousands of loyal condo voters who helped the Democratic
Party to keep electing governors like the late Lawton Chiles as
immigration from Cuba and retirees from more conservative states
made Florida increasingly Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between now and 2010, the Democratic Party will be losing its
most stable and loyal core,'' said Lance de Haven-Smith, a
political science professor at Florida State University who is
associate director of the Florida Institute of Government.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of casting block votes for Democrats, the new condo
residents are either less inclined to vote, cannot vote because
they are not U.S. citizens or, as in the case with Cuban-Americans
who have migrated north from Miami, usually vote Republican, said
Jim Kane, Editor of the Florida Voter, a news service that does
polling and analysis of Florida politics.
</P>
<P>
   In the Hawaiian Gardens condo, in Lauderdale Lakes in Broward
County, more than 4,000 registered voters, mostly Democrats, once
filled its rooms. But in the past decade, as Canadians and younger
families have moved in, that number of registered voters has fallen
to 2,000, said Kane. Other condos have shown similar shifts in
their makeup, all around this part of Florida, said Kane and others
who have tracked the shift.
</P>
<P>
   In just the past four years, the average age of voters in
Broward County has fallen from 64 to 57, said Kane.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not something that will have an overnight effect on
elections in South Florida,'' said Kane.
</P>
<P>
   But it does signal the end of an era. ``These old people are
primarily from the northeast, retired postal workers, garment
workers, who bought modest condominiums,'' said Kane. ``They were
primarily blue collar, people who had belonged to unions, who had
good pensions.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would rather vote for the devil himself than vote for a
Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   In a special report by the Miami Herald in March, an analysis of
voting in districts dominated by what people here call the ``condo
commandos'' found that, while these older still vote at a higher
percentage than other groups, fewer and fewer elderly residents are
voting in elections. And, the analysis predicted, it is only a
matter of time until those New Deal Democrats are no longer a major
factor in elections here.
</P>
<P>
   Political experts in Florida, and some of the people who make up
that demographic, agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``You reach a certain age, you grow infirm, or you go bye-bye,''
said Mrs. Radow, whose own age, she stressed, is nobody's business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just say I'm a senior citizen,'' she said, and adds with pride
that she still volunteers during elections, still works the phones
to get out the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Retirees are still coming to South Florida, but they are not the
same generation, or from the same world, as the ones who came south
in the 1960s and 1970s, as Mrs. Radow, or men like David Goldin.
</P>
<P>
   Goldin survived three months a German prison camp after he was
captured in the Battle of the Bulge. Voting, to him, is a not just
a right, but a duty. He voted for ideals, not for tax shelters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I've ever voted Republican,'' said Goldin, 88, a
widower who lives in Century Village, a condo in Deerfield Beach.
``I'm mad about them now, because of that impeachment. They're just
so _ what's the word? _ partisan.''
</P>
<P>
   He made his living in the garment industry, as a buyer for
retail stores, worked hard and wanted to prolong his life in the
warmth of the Florida sun.
</P>
<P>
   It worked, he said. He feels he added years to his life, and
years to the power of his vote, much to the Florida Republicans
dismay.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanics, particularly the Cubans, have been the political
force in Miami-Dade County for years. But in northeastern areas of
that county and in Broward, elderly Democrats stood tall for a
quarter-century. If they went to city council meetings to get a
stoplight at a busy intersection, they got it. Presidential
hopefuls treked to their temples. And unlike the tax-phobic
Midwesterners who retired to the Gulf Coast, they supported new
schools and libraries.
</P>
<P>
   It was the old South Florida Republicans, who held power here
before the arrival of the New Deal Democrats, who ushered in this
exodus of elderly, more liberal voters. They built the condos that
lured them here.
</P>
<P>
   But their votes were not a resource that could be replenished.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One of the crown jewels of South Florida politics has long been
the massive Century Village condo in Deerfield Beach, home to as
many as 15,000 people _ the number slips to 12,000 in the
oppressive heat of summers. Most residents are elderly, and
politically active. It has not just one Democrat club, but two.
</P>
<P>
   Presiding over that bounty of votes is Amadeo ``Trinchi''
Trinchitella, a retired bar and restaurant owner from New York. No
one gets elected in this part of Florida, everyone here says,
unless first they talk to ``Trinchi.'' The President of the United
States knows him, as have past Presidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I voted Roosevelt, Truman, Kennedy, Democrat all the way,''
said Trinchitella, the condo president and a Deerfield Beach
commissioner who is considered a master at getting out the vote.
</P>
<P>
   But he has seen that power base, once in their vibrant 60s,
begin to grow older, more infirm. ``We have fallen 2,500 votes in
the past decade,'' he said. In that decade, half of the condo has
passed away, he said, and he has worked hard to re-fill the
registration rolls with new Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not going to sit here and cry,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Trinchitella, 81 years old and recovering from heart surgery,
was too sick to make his usual hard push for votes during a
county-wide referendum on a issue to build new libraries.
</P>
<P>
   Broward averages a 22 percent voter turnout on such elections,
but the bond issue decision drew only 10 percent of voters (the
bond issue was approved). Political experts see that as another
small sign of the waning strength of the older Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   A more significant sign was the 1998 Florida Governor's race.
</P>
<P>
   Most people in Broward County still vote Democratic, but the
loss of the elderly Democrats can be found in a drop in voter
turnout, said Kane. In the 1994 race for Governor, Lawton Chiles,
the Democrat, beat Jeb Bush, the Republican, and carried the county
with 64 percent, winning 120,000 votes.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Lieut. Gov. Kenneth H. ``Buddy'' MacKay, who lost the
election to Jeb Bush, carried Broward County with 61 percent, but
with just 83,000 votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``In one time, condos made up 40 percent of the voting,'' said
Edward Pozzuoli, chairman of the Broward County Republican Party.
He believes that number has slipped to between 25 and 28 percent,
</P>
<P>
   The majority of registered voters between the ages of 35 and 50
are Republican, but overall, Democrats still outnumber Republicans
by 18 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeb Bush tried to target and spend time with seniors, but the
impact of that effort was three or four points, not a lot,'' said
Pozzuoli. ``That takes a lot of effort, so we focused on a younger
population. That's where the county is going _ the issues affecting
young familes.''
</P>
<P>
   Condos that once cost as much as $40,000, two decades ago, are
selling for as little as $16,000, as older residents die out and
leave them to their children, who do not want to retire in this
altered South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``When those families moved here, traffic wasn't that bad,
getting to the grocery store wasn't a problem,'' said Kane. ``All
of that has changed. Now they tend to go to other areas, like the
west coast of Florida.''
</P>
<P>
   That means an abundance of cheap housing here for immigrants,
who are moving in and living side by side with the older retirees.
</P>
<P>
   A long drive through South Florida proves that out. Children on
bicycles spin through older people propped up by walkers in
northeastern Dade County. In Wolfie's deli on Miami Beach, Spanish
drowns out the yiddish still being spoken at a table here and
there. From the Miami Beach condos, through Broward and up into
Palm Beach County, condos that were once filled with the elderly
now have baby strollers.
</P>
<P>
   It is a different world from the one the older Democrats made
for themselves here, with the power of their numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems as if only people my age care about the issues, and
that is ridiculous,'' said Sam Weinstein, 83, who now lives in
Deerfield Beach. ``I vote in ever single election. I started the
time I got back from the service in the F.D.R. days. I feel like
that process is dying, and it saddens me.''
</P>
<P>
   People 20 years younger see the process differently. They have
grown up with political scandal, with candidates who failed them in
many ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many times, I don't go out and vote because I know I am not
going to mame a difference,'' said Guenter Huebschmann, 60, a
registered Democrat living in Boca Raton.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats are expected, in the long term, to recoup some of
those lost votes, said Trinchitella, and that is something he and
the other older Democrats are working on.
</P>
<P>
   As their own number fade, they recruit Hispanics who disagree
with the Miami Cuban-Americans' conservatism, and try to register
people from other social and economic groups.
</P>
<P>
   And they work hard to keep the elderly voting, even if they have
to vote on walkers or wheelchairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't travel much, these days,'' said Goldin, but he can
make it as far as the voting booth.
</P>
<P>
   Political activists like Trinchitella refuse to give up, even as
they see familiar faces fade away. ``It's a slow process to catch
up,'' he said. ``I just look to the future.''

<P>
   Two weeks into the NATO air campaign against Yugoslavia, most
Americans expect the conflict there to drag on for months or years,
to involve the deployment of U.S. ground troops and to cause the
loss of American lives, according to the latest New York Times/CBS
News poll.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of Americans support President Clinton's policy in
the conflict between Serbia and Kosovo, the poll shows, with 52
percent expressing approval, 36 percent voicing disapproval and 11
percent unsure. But fewer than a third of the 811 adults
interviewed by telephone on Monday and Tuesday said they thought
the current NATO bombing campaign against the forces of Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic would stop ethnic cleansing in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember Vietnam?'' asked Jim Demarco of Dunbar, Pa., who
works for a water-supply company. One of the respondents
interviewed in follow-up sessions after the poll, he insisted,
``You can't do anything with air strikes'' by themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Suyama, a retired schoolteacher in Hawaii, reflected the
fatalistic sense that many Americans seem to feel about the events
in Kosovo. An advocate of heavier bombing, she argued that NATO
needed ``to wipe out most of Pristina and Belgrade'' _ the capitals
of Kosovo and of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the bad guy,'' she acknowledged. ``They don't want us
there. We're damned if we do, damned if we don't. It's not worth
the loss of American lives. American soldiers will be mired down
there for years.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey showed considerable public caution about the
commitment of ground troops, which Clinton has opposed from the
start. Overall, 46 percent of Americans said they favored the use
of ground troops, while 48 percent opposed it. And when given three
options _ sending ground troops, continuing air attacks or pulling
out altogether _ only 21 percent opted for ground troops. If
sending ground troops meant a lot of allied casualties, even fewer
said they would back the use of ground forces.
</P>
<P>
   Yet majorities of those interviewed in the poll, which has a
margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points,
expressed the view that any of several goals would justify the
introduction of ground troops. Among them: preventing a widespread
European war, driving Milosevic from power and stopping the further
destruction of ethnic Albanian communities in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Backing for ground forces was strongest among those who said
they had been following the fighting most closely, 55 percent, and
is slowly growing among voters in general as the bombing campaign
and the plight of refugees are dramatized on television screens.
That runs counter to the conventional wisdom that TV coverage
undercuts political leaders' ability to expose troops to danger.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Wednesday that he and his allies were ``determined
to stay united and to persist until we prevail.'' Thus far, the
public accepts that strategy, even though it doubts that Milosevic
will buckle soon.
</P>
<P>
   There were only scattered signs in the poll of the isolationism
that many Europeans profess to detect in the United States these
days. Only a little over a third of the public said that this
country lacked responsibility to do anything to help in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But there are danger signs for the president. Asked whether they
had confidence in Clinton's ability ``to deal wisely with an
international crisis,'' respondents split evenly. Forty-seven
percent said they had such confidence, but 48 percent said they
felt uneasy about Clinton. And only 28 percent _ less than a third
_ said they thought the president had a clear plan for Kosovo; most
of the rest said he was just reacting to events.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, four out of 10 voters said the president had still not
explained American policy to their satisfaction, despite repeated
statements, speeches and other comments recently.
</P>
<P>
   The poll also indicates that voters are paying unusually careful
attention to the events in Kosovo. Almost nine Americans in 10 said
they were watching developments there closely or very closely _ an
exceptionally high figure for any foreign-policy subject in the
post-Cold War era. That suggests that many people are in a
watch-and-wait mode, reserving final judgment until the conflict
has evolved further.
</P>
<P>
   If that is indeed the case, overall support for Clinton could
soften rapidly in the face of adverse developments on the ground in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, despite general approval, there is an undercurrent of
nervousness in people's comments about the president, especially
among Republicans. Tina Colbert, a 23-year-old bank worker in
Jefferson City, Tenn., near Knoxville, said she thought ``Americans
get way too involved in other countries' problems, and not enough
with our own.''
</P>
<P>
   A Republican, she added: ``I don't have a lot of confidence in
Clinton. It makes me wonder about his motives.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim Broughman, 47, who runs a cleaning company in Kannapolis,
N.C., and describes herself as a political independent, said she
thought the United States should stay out of Kosovo and attend to
domestic problems like homelessness. Although she tries to learn as
much as she can about Kosovo, she said, ``Lately, I don't know
who's telling the truth and who's not.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Phyllis McGraw, 51, an apartment manager in Jackson,
Miss., said, ``I favor helping the people, but there are times that
things are done for other reasons _ political reasons.'' Her
comments and others hinted at doubts arising from the president's
conduct in the Monica Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   Casualties, if any, will inevitably have an impact on public
support.
</P>
<P>
   Americans have not become so accustomed to televised, high-tech,
easily winnable wars that they expect the American military to win
the next one without casualties. At least as far as Kosovo, the
poll shows, attitudes are much more subtle than that.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to a hypothetical question dealing with winning wars
vs. limiting casualties, about half of those polled said the United
States and its allies should use whatever force was necessary to
win, regardless of casualties. The other half favored restraint.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to the current conflict, however, a clear majority
of Americans say they would rather risk a protracted involvement
than run the risk of casualties. Hence they oppose escalating the
current level of conflict.
</P>
<P>
   From the president's point of view, the best news in the poll,
politically speaking, is that about half of all Americans see the
war, as Clinton does, as a moral imperative. Voters who view
conflict in those terms are less likely to cut and run at the first
sign of trouble than are the pragmatists.
</P>
<P>
   The new poll found a growing sense of responsibility for
providing aid for the refugees, apparently a response to the
horrific scenes of thousands of ethnic Albanians from Kosovo forced
to live in the open, in bad weather and without adequate sanitation
or nourishment, in Macedonia and Albania. Nearly eight of 10
respondents said the United States had such responsibilities, up
from 66 percent just four days ago.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 60 percent said that it was right to airlift 20,000
refugees and care for them at the Guantanamo Naval Base in Cuba,
and 21 percent said more aid should be provided. Nearly half of
those polled said that aid to the Kosovo refugees should have begun
sooner.

<P>
   The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone
interviews conducted on Monday and Tuesday with 811 adults
throughout the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The sample of telephone exchanges called was randomly selected
by a computer from a complete list of more than 54,000 active
residential exchanges across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Within each exchange, random digits were added to form a
complete telephone number, thus permitting access to both listed
and unlisted numbers. Within each household, one adult was
designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the
survey.
</P>
<P>
   The results have been weighted to take account of household size
and number of telephone lines into the residence, to adjust for
variations in the sample relating to geographic region, sex, race,
age, marital status, education, and to reflect party strength in
the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such
samples will differ by no more than 3 percentage points in either
direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all
American adults.
</P>
<P>
   For smaller subgroups, the margin of sampling error is larger.
For example, for people who said they have been following news
about NATO air strikes ``very closely,'' it is plus or minus 5
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of
conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources
of error into the poll. Variations in the wording and order of
questions, for example, may lead to somewhat different results.

   MORINI, Albania _ Tens of thousands of refugees from Kosovo
waiting to cross the border here vanished in the middle of the
night, ordered out of a column stretching 20 miles or more by
Serbian forces and sent walking to an unknown fate.
</P>
<P>
   This shabby little border crossing, swamped for more than a week
with ragged, weeping ethnic Albanians driven from their homes, was
eerily empty Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   At 3:30 Wednesday morning, Serbian forces walked up to a jumble
of six chest-high concrete pyramids that marks the midpoint of the
no-man's land between the two customs posts, according to observers
at the border from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe. Those on the Albanian side could keep on going; those still
in the Serbian zone were ordered to turn around.
</P>
<P>
   No one here knows what happened to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no idea,'' said Jacques Franquin, a spokesman for the
U.N. high commissioner for refugees. ``We are very worried. There
is reason to be worried.''
</P>
<P>
   From observation posts in the surrounding hills, the road into
Kosovo appeared to be empty of any vehicles for two miles or so
north, Franquin said, up to the next village, Szure, which the
Serbs have been using as a dropping-off place for refugees being
transported in bus and truck convoys after being rounded up farther
inside Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, he added, there were lines of abandoned farm
tractors and cars. When the column was turned back on Tuesday
night, the refugees were backed up to the city of Prizren, about 22
miles away, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stunned aid officials here could only speculate on the latest
twist in the tactics of the Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever is happening, you can rest assured it is not to the
benefit of these refugees,'' said Eugene O'Sullivan, the chief of
the Organization for Security and Cooperation observer team based
in nearby Kukes.
</P>
<P>
   The speculation included the possibility of a new propaganda
ploy by Milosevic in which he would maintain that the ethnic
Albanians were not being systematically hounded out after all, but
were being allowed to return to their homes voluntarily. It was
also possible that the refugees were being herded back to some
collection center, either as some form of hostages or even human
shields against NATO bombing attacks or attacks by Apache
helicopters, which, unlike the bombers, can fly close to the ground
and take aim at concentrations of troops and tanks.
</P>
<P>
   During the ``ethnic cleansing'' campaign in Bosnia, Serbs used
captured U.N. soldiers as shields.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a pretty sinister turn of events,'' said Doran
Vienneau, an observer on the border. He predicted the border would
be closed for an extended period.
</P>
<P>
   Relief officials estimated that roughly 80,000 refugees were in
the line when it was turned back, based at the rate at which
refugees have been flowing through here and the length of time the
last group Wednesday morning had been on the road. NATO has
estimated there are some 300,000 people who have been uprooted from
their homes but are still displaced inside Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   From midnight until the refugees were turned back at 3:30, some
2,850 people made it out of Kosovo, making a total of 238,415 who
have crossed the border here since the Serbian campaign of
depopulating the province began. In addition, 51,850 have crossed
the even more remote and primitive mountains of the Hass District
to the northwest of here, most of them on a track over the
mountains which can only be traveled on foot because the Serbs have
mined it. That border crossing was sealed on Tuesday; the day
before, some 14,000 people crossed over.
</P>
<P>
   And, incredibly, one more man somehow wandered over the border
at midday. Ismet Hoxha said he had only encountered one Serbian
police patrol as he walked from his remote village, Gjonas. He said
the police inspected his hands _ apparently to see if he looked
tough enough to have been digging trenches for the Kosovo
Liberation Army, although most of the refugees are work-hardened
farmers _ and let him go. He said he had passed a line of empty,
abandoned tractors more than a mile long on his way.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the luckiest Albanian in the world,'' Vienneau said. ``He
should buy a lottery ticket. This is his day.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For a week and a half, this border post, with its peeling paint,
chipped concrete and broken iron gate, has been a scene of chaos as
the refugees have poured across at the rate of 20,000 to 50,000 a
day with only what they can carry. Often it is a wooden cradle,
decorated with folk patterns that is a particularly valued family
heirloom among the Albanians strapped to the back of their farm
carts. Some people have been walking for days, carrying only a
blanket or a few clothes. They cry in relief as they cross the
border.
</P>
<P>
   All have harrowing _ and strikingly similar _ accounts of being
ordered out of their houses by Serbian special policemen, soldiers
and ultra-nationalist irregulars, many wearing masks or head bands.
They are robbed at gunpoint, herded to collection centers in the
larger towns, and robbed again along the way. All of their
identification is stripped away.
</P>
<P>
   Many say they have witnessed the Serbs killing people, sometimes
apparently at random, but often in what appears to be a systematic
manner, targeting, for instance, people who housed, worked for or
otherwise aided the Organization for Security and Cooperation
observer teams in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   And there have been accounts of mass killings. While the
accounts cannot be independently verified because foreign
journalists and relief workers, including the observers, have been
expelled from Kosovo, they are being given credence here because of
their striking similarity, the specific details provided by the
refugees and the past behavior of Serbian forces during the ethnic
cleansing of Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday the crossing was empty and silent, save for a few
listless Albanian policemen and mystified aid workers. There were
only a few refugees sprawled on the hillside, now muddy and
littered with scraps of plastic, cardboard and squashed cans from
emergency ration packets, where people have rested after reaching
Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Across the empty patch of no man's land the Serbian and Yugoslav
flags flap from their poles. The Serbian forces were digging
trenches with pickaxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The refugees have been in a state of complete shock and terror
when they arrive here,'' said Vienneau, the observer at the border
post Wednesday morning. ``They are in an absolutely deplorable
state, with just the possessions they have on their backs. They
have been witness to very horrific crimes. We've had multiple
reports of people being rounded up and executed en masse. We've had
reports of constant brutalization throughout the journey here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel almost sick to my stomach because I have no idea what
happened to these people,'' he said, speaking of the missing tens
of thousands of refugees, adding:
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you imagine being the guy on the first tractor when the
Serbs said, `Go back,' and they were so close to the border. I
would say the state of terror of these people is probably
absolutely indescribable, wondering what is going to happen to
them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One can only assume that things are very bad for them at the
moment,'' he said.

RIGHTS WORKERS DESCRIBE MASSIVE EVACUATION OF REFUGEES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SKOPJE, Macedonia _ In the dead of night, tens of thousands of
ethnic Albanian refugees who had been hemmed in for days along the
Kosovo border were abruptly herded onto buses Tuesday night and
taken against their will to neighboring Albania and unknown
locations, human rights workers said.
</P>
<P>
   By dawn Wednesday, the swift forced move, carried out in less
than seven hours, left the squalid encampment in Blace, which had
been bursting at the seams with more than 40,000 refugees, a
desolate wasteland.
</P>
<P>
   In the chaotic evacuation, families were torn apart and
thousands of people forced to leave without knowing where they were
headed, according to human rights workers who were present at the
scene or helped eyewitnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We strongly condemn these involuntary displacements,'' said
Paula Ghedini, spokesperson for the UNHCR. ``This was done in a
dark night. People were terrified and had no idea where they were
being taken.''
</P>
<P>
   Local television footage showed Macedonian police, armed with
rifles and wearing white masks against the stench and disease,
pushing the refugees into a long line of buses.
</P>
<P>
   But, Gehdini added, it appeared some of the refugees _ desperate
to flee the camp's open sewers, spreading disease, and lack of food
_ seemed to prefer the evacuation to spending any more time on a
muddy hillside in Blace, just past the ``no man's land'' between
Macedonia and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   By Wednesday night, aid workers said they had traced about
10,000 people to Albania and another 10,000 to a holding center at
Stenkovec in Macedonia. The center, set up by NATO, is a transit
point from which the refugees are either sent to permanent camps or
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``We essentially cannot account for somewhere between 10,000 to
20,000 people. We don't know where they were taken,'' Ghedini said.
</P>
<P>
   The refugee camp in the border town of Blace, some 20 miles
north of the Macedonian capital Skopje, had become a worldwide
symbol of the misery and desperation of the ethnic Albanians who
had been forced out of Kosovo by the Serbian forces of Yugoslav
president Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The influx of refugees also threatened to dangerously disrupt a
delicate ethnic balance in Macedonia, which is 67 percent Slavic,
23 percent Albanian and a 10 percent mixture of ethnic backgrounds,
including Serbs. Many human rights workers said they believed the
Macedonian police had forced the refugees out to prevent the
turmoil that could ensue if tens of thousands of ethnic Albanians
settled permanently in Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   Literally overnight, the authorities appear to have emptied the
camp.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday morning, the only sign of life in the camp was an old
woman wandering through an eery haze of smoke from still-smoldering
campfires and a mangy black dog picking through piles of garbage.
The putrid smell of human feces and rotten food lingered in the
air.
</P>
<P>
   Hida Ajeta, 81, of Pristina, was the last refugee.
</P>
<P>
   She told a Globe photographer that she had been separated from
her family and was going to wait for them to return. Confused but
stubborn, she refused to leave. She explained that her sister had
grown ill in the camp and been sent to the hospital, and that she
would not leave without her.
</P>
<P>
   There was visible evidence that many had left without time to
collect their belongings. Passports, unopened packages of diapers,
baby food, clothing, blankets, pillows, and winter coats lay
discarded amid the abandoned rows of tents fashioned out of plastic
tarps and tree branches.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who are leaving on their own don't leave behind baby
food and passports,'' said UNHCR's Ghedini.
</P>
<P>
   Macedonian officials defended their decision to push the
refugees out of the encampment along the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have tried to do our utmost,'' said Tihomir Ilievski, under
secretary in Macedonia's Foreign Ministry, ``but the situation on
the border was very difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters, he said the government of the republic,
which broke away off from Yugoslavia in 1992, feared that the
situation would ``upset the ethnic balance in our country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That is why we have said from the beginning we could accept
20,000,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 125,000 refugees from Kosovo had fled to Macedonia
since the NATO airstrikes began two weeks ago, according to the UN
refugee agency, which said precise numbers were impossible to
obtain. About 45,000 were in a chain of refugee camps set up by the
UN and NATO inside Macedonia. About 10,000 had been sent to
Albania. Between 40,000 to 60,000 refugees have been absorbed into
the homes of ethnic Albanian relatives, friends and former
neighbors inside Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   The United States expressed anger at Macedonia's late-night
evacuation and reminded the government that it must adhere to
international standards in dealing with the Kosovo refugees.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman James Rubin said, ``We have sent a
strong message to the government of Macedonia that we will hold it
to the highest standard of humanitarian law and expect it to uphold
internationally accepted laws in the treatment of refugees and
evacuation procedures.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin added that the United States understands the concerns of
the Macedonian government, which faces considerable pro-Serb
sentiment from its Slav majority and fears the influx of ethnic
Albanians will swell its Albanian minority and destabilize the
nation of 2.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nevertheless, we believe that for example it's simply wrong to
separate family members or to have people not volunteer to leave
and to ship them out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said that as international relief efforts increase and
refugees are moved to other countries _ 100,000 going to various
European countries _ the crisis will ease in Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   Some 600,000 people have left Kosovo since the conflict between
ethnic Albanians and Yugoslav forces began in the Serbian province
in March last year, according to the UN refugee agency..
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman said that in addition to the closing of the
Macedonia border, Albanian authorities had closed border crossings
at the Morini and Qafe Prushit Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   A statement said, ``There were disquieting reports from inside
Kosovo that authorities there were now sending people back to their
home areas and turning them away from the Macedonian border.''

IRONY AND NARCISSISM ON `LATE, LATE SHOW' 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Check local listings for time and channel.)  
 By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``You're frighteningly like my ex-boyfriend,'' pop star Shirley
Manson told Craig Kilborn this week on CBS.
</P>
<P>
   I'm guessing Kilborn gets that a lot.
</P>
<P>
   Kilborn, the new host of ``The Late Late Show,'' could be the
prototypical ex-boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   He's the guy who started watching a ballgame with his buddies
and forgot the dinner date to meet his girlfriend's parents.
</P>
<P>
   Or the one who lent his shoulder when you were crying and held
you, until you realized he was sneaking peeks at himself in the
mirror.
</P>
<P>
   That's the persona Kilborn cultivates. But then you're also
supposed to know it's an act. Still, you can't help thinking that
the fact it's an act might be a head feint, masking the chance that
Kilborn really is a preening, insensitive, soulless automaton.
</P>
<P>
   When a TV talk show is as aggressively deconstructive as
Kilborn's ``Late Late Show,'' your head is bound to spin with these
uncertainties.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose it's David Letterman's fault. Letterman brought the
architecture of mockery to his old NBC show and later to CBS.
</P>
<P>
   He seemed to tell a media-savvy generation that TV was asinine,
his own show was stupid and, for that matter, he was probably a
jerk. So let's chisel some mirth out of all that with an ice pick.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not really very sincere,'' guest Charles Grodin said to
Letterman on Monday night, in one of their feigned sparring
matches.
</P>
<P>
   But the answer should be real enough: no. That's precisely the
point. On TV, sincerity excuses itself and goes to bed right after
the evening news.
</P>
<P>
   Remember how Letterman was a visigod _ which is to say, TV deity
_ to hundreds of thousands of guys in college frat houses and
dormitories?
</P>
<P>
   What happened to all those boys? Well, one of them was Craig
Kilborn. And now he has his own show, right behind Letterman.
</P>
<P>
   One of the differences is that Letterman hates himself, or
pretends to, or pretends to but (set ital)does(end ital) hate
himself, while Kilborn's trick is to love himself. A lot.
</P>
<P>
   In one gag, the camera catches Kilborn in midnarcissism, holding
a hand mirror and looking adoringly at himself.
</P>
<P>
   In another, he finishes his opening and then stands pensively by
a window on his woody, masculine set. In voice-over, he
congratulates himself on the progress of that night's show. This is
after the monologue and Kilborn's ``In the News'' segment. The
monologue is the most sparse around, a few lean slices of processed
joke material. If Jay Leno serves up the TV monologue equivalent of
Wagner's ``Ring'' tetralogy, then Kilborn is a quick ``Saber
Dance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the News'' apparently gets more attention. The segment is
Kilborn at his cruelest. Refugees from Kosovo have been
consistently amusing since Kilborn's show premiered last week. All
things Mexican seem to be funny, too, in the way Letterman targets
Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   On Kosovo: ``Some even believe the events unfolding in Kosovo
could lead to the ultimate horror _ another crazy Oscar acceptance
speech by Roberto Benigni.'' On a Mexican money-laundering scandal:
``The first time in history anything in Mexico has ever been
laundered.''
</P>
<P>
   Save us all from the curse of political correctness. Yet, a
modicum of taste and a teaspoon of empathy is mandatory for WASPish
men.
</P>
<P>
   Kilborn has also been poking fun at the hunk Fabio, who somehow
was plastered by a migrating goose while riding a roller coaster.
Now that (set ital)is(end ital) funny. Must these distinctions be
explained?
</P>
<P>
   Kilborn has done his best work with his guests. Shirley Manson
was a match for him, taking an airy punch in his direction when she
disapproved of something he said. Jeff Goldblum always seems to
wash in on a wave of helium. (But did Kilborn really need to ask
him, ``By the way, what are you promoting? Why are you here?'')
</P>
<P>
   Bill Murray is foolproof, and the stars of the Telemundo version
of ``Charlie's Angels'' were suited for Kilborn's leer routine.
Thursday night, Hugh Hefner.
</P>
<P>
   Here, Kilborn has been showing some spark. He listens to his
guests. He asks questions based on what they say, rather than
rattling them off an index card. There appear to be bolts of
extemporaneous give-and-take.
</P>
<P>
   This is what used to be called conversation, and once upon a
time talk shows were based on it. Kilborn seems to have the
wherewithal to handle conversation, if he chooses.
</P>
<P>
   So there is always hope for civilization on the airwaves. More
likely, though, the mask of comic irony will stay firmly in place,
and viewers will be asked to feel they're part of some big snicker.
</P>
<P>
   Then, whenever Kilborn takes his leave _ six months from now,
six years, 10 years or 20 _ we'll be as indifferent to his fate as
he is to some desperately terrified refugee in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   I mean, it won't be as if we really (set ital)knew(end ital) the
guy.

 &HT;    U.S. Air Force Troops Do Their Bit On the Ground Against
Milosevic
 &HT;    With PHOTOS 
 &HT;    By MARCIA KUNSTEL and JOSEPH ALBRIGHT 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service (at)
<TEXT>
<P>
   RINAS AIR FORCE BASE, Albania American airmen started laboring
Wednesday to turn this broken down airfield into the nerve center
of NATO's Task Force Shining Hope, the rescue mission finally
organized to save hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanian refugees
driven from their Kosovo homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told my boys I had to go away to work to help some people
out,'' said Staff Sgt. Wesley Paul Eidson, 26, of Bowdon, GA., who
left his wife and two sons back at Ramstein Air Base in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after stepping off an Air Force C-17 transport Wednesday
onto the cracked concrete runway, Eidson was burying water pipes at
the grassy air base still dotted with scores of abandoned domed
concrete bunkers, the former headquarters of the Albanian Air
Force.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to get potable water to the shower units,'' said
Senior Airman Mitch Raney, 27, of Waco, Texas, who was taking a
break with Eidson in the sunny and still warm late afternoon.
``We're still not entirely sure if it's potable ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's the only water available from the capital city Tirana
15 miles to the southeast, just as this air base that doubles as
the nation's single commercial airport is the only big field
available to handle the bulky cargo transports and mega-tons of
supplies that are beginning to ferry in aid from governments around
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Rinas airfield is but one example of the obstacles military and
relief organizations are encountering in Albania, a threadbare
nation where the best roads are awful, supplies hard to find and
equipment so marginal that aid workers said there was a single
forklift in the country just a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The American airmen and a few airwomen are taking the lead for
NATO at this site where Albanian, French and Italian military also
are working, according to the U.S. Air Force spokesman here, Master
Sgt. Michael Land, 33, of Lakeland, Fla. The first U.S. contingent
arrived at Rinas Air Base Sunday night, and by this weekend an
estimated 400 American troops will be on the ground and working.
</P>
<P>
   Their job is air traffic control and circulation and loading and
unloading humanitarian aid that comes in. On Wednesday the NATO
soldiers handled six American C-130 transports and five of
America's larger C-17 transports, along with an assortment of
planes from the Middle East to the Atlantic. Two of the wide-bodied
cargo planes one with Russian markings and another from Egypt were
still sitting on the air field.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the only K-loaders and forklifts. So we can do the
job,'' Land said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has yet to announce where it will headquarter Task Force
Hawk, the combat forces that will include 24 U.S. Apache helicopter
gunships and 2,000 support troops. The Apaches are expected to
begin arriving as early as next week in a marked escalation of the
assault on Yugoslav military forces that NATO charges have been
carrying out ethnic cleansing of the Albanian
</P>
<P>
   population across the border in Yugoslavia's suffering province
of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The men and women of Relief Force Tirana, the American component
of Task Force Shining Hope, are on a humanitarian rather than
combat mission. But some of the troops are edgy nonetheless, and
some have gotten indications that their jobs may not be limited to
digging ditches or guarding the shabby perimeter fence surrounding
the airfield.
</P>
<P>
   Staff Sgt. Noah Coon, 26, of Cocoa Beach, Fla., is a security
officer whose unit had six weeks of special training for this
assignment at Charleston Air Force Base in South Carolina, where he
is stationed. The crash course was in weapons training, map and
compass use and land navigation, Coon said, the kinds of skills
more useful out in the field, not guarding a gate as he was doing
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks a little scary, just being in a different country,
being so close to Yugoslavia,'' acknowledged Eidson, the Georgia
airman.
</P>
<P>
   Eidson said his wife back at Ramstein was frantic, at least
briefly, when she learned he was being shipped out to the NATO
operations here.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was worried we'd be in Macedonia where those guys got
captured,'' he said, referring to the three U.S. soldiers still
being held by Serb authorities who claim they had infiltrated into
Yugoslav territory during a perimeter exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is Eidson totally sanguine about the prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody knows what will happen,'' he said. ``That's what's so
scary.''

   PAIRGAIN-WEB-FRAUD (NEW YORK) _ One of the oldest frauds on Wall

site designed to look like the Internet page of Bloomberg Business
News, someone posted a fake news story that said an American
technology company called PairGain Technologies Inc. was being
taken over by an Israeli rival. The report spread to a Yahoo
message board and then to other sites frequented by stock traders,
who quickly bid up PairGain's stock by more than 30 percent. By
midday, the stock had retreated as the takeover story was debunked.

NEW TARGET DATES SET FOR RAYTHEON AIR-TRAFFIC CONTROL SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- A new national air-traffic control system being
developed by Raytheon Co. has missed its debut date at Logan
International Airport and won't enter service anytime soon, the
Federal Aviation Administration said.
</P>
<P>
   The $1 billion system was supposed to be rolled out at Logan in
December in what was touted as the first installation for the new
nationwide network.
</P>
<P>
   But slow development work and the need for input from
air-traffic controllers has forced the agency to scrap that
schedule. No new target dates have been set, for Logan or
elsewhere, said William Shumann, FAA spokesman in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, kinks that have surfaced mean that the system may not
be introduced at all at Logan, but at a civilian airport with far
less traffic, the FAA said. ``Right now, the specifics of the
entire system are up in the air, so to speak,'' Shumann said.
</P>
<P>
   Delays in the system, known as the Standard Terminal Automation
Replacement System, or STARS, have been reported before, but the
FAA previously hasn't discussed rollout dates at most airports.
</P>
<P>
   The slips at Logan were disclosed amid continuing criticism of
the project. Including maintenance contracts, STARS will cost $2.2
billion by 2025. Construction, development and installation will
account for $1 billion of that.
</P>
<P>
   The system is meant to replace an aging analog-based air-traffic
system blamed for a plethora of mishaps and near-misses. Among
other things, the FAA says the aging technology caused a 37-minute
outage at a New England tracking center in Nashua, N.H. in August,
forcing air-traffic controllers to keep track of planes with
handwritten notes.
</P>
<P>
   A team led by Raytheon, based in Lexington, Mass., was awarded
the contract for the STARS project in September 1996, and had
planned to finish the job by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   In response to a report in USA Today, the FAA also confirmed
that tests showed a component of STARS known as an ``early display
configuration'' wasn't meeting expectations. The component,
essentially an advanced radar display, is meant to provide new
features for controllers using the agency's existing radar-tracking
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The displays were scheduled to be installed in Washington's
Reagan National Airport last month, but that hasn't happened and
the agency says it plans to revise the schedule sometime this
month.
</P>
<P>
   The agency had previously mentioned problems with the displays
in early February. The agency also noted the tests reported by USA
Today were performed by a competitor of Raytheon's, Lockheed
Martin, which is trying to sell the FAA on a competing product. A
spokesman for Lockheed didn't return calls.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon spokesman David Polk defended STARS and said the system
has performed well in tests at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida. But
executives there weren't available to discuss the project in
detail, he said. Raytheon has not been penalized for the delays in
the STARS schedule, the government said.
</P>
<P>
   Other members of the group led by Raytheon include Sun
Microsystems and United Faculty Associates of Lexington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said they are more puzzled than concerned about
Raytheon's work on the contract to date. ``You've got to believe
that Raytheon will have the system up and running soon,'' said CS
First Boston analyst Peter Aseritis. ``The negative aspect is, it
was supposed to be up and running by now.''
</P>
<P>
   Shares in Raytheon fell 1 1/4 in New York Stock Exchange trading
to close at 59 3/8.

EL-AMIN STAYS WITH UCONN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The advice University of Connecticut coach Jim Calhoun gave
sophomore point guard Khalid El-Amin was simple. Wait a year.
You'll be better off in the long run. And so will we.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, after considering all the options, El-Amin, the heart
and sometimes soul of UConn's national championship team this
season, decided to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think doing it a second time will be even better,'' said
El-Amin, whose decision to return should make the Huskies one of
the preseason picks to contend for the national title again next
season.
</P>
<P>
   Several factors played into El-Amin's decision, including where
he would fall in a draft expected to be top heavy with guards, and
whether another year of college would work to his long-range
benefit.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-foot-10-inch sophomore has been a leader on the Huskies
since he arrived from Minneapolis two seasons ago. Calhoun gave
El-Amin more freedom to do things on the court than he had allowed
any freshman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Khalid is something special,'' Calhoun said more than once
during the Huskies' 36-2 championship season.
</P>
<P>
   A starter in 71 games and only the third player in UConn history
to score at least 1,000 points by the end of his sophomore season,
El-Amin ran the Huskies offense, averaging 13.8 points per game
this season as well as leading the team in assists.
</P>
<P>
   But it was El-Amin's spirit, as shown when he made key free
throws in wins over Gonzaga in the NCAA West Regional final and
over Duke in the the championship game, that drew Calhoun's praise
and affection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Khalid obviously played a major role in our national
championship journey,'' Calhoun said. ``I believe he will enjoy an
even more dynamic role as he expands his wonderful leadership
qualities.''
</P>
<P>
   With Richard Hamilton, who is likely to leave early for the NBA,
and Ricky Moore gone, El-Amin's leadership and skills will be
needed if the Huskies can come close to repeating this year's
success.
</P>
<P>
   El-Amin, who has two children, could have chosen the financial
security he expects to find in the NBA, but for the time being, he
has chosen to stay with a family of Huskies instead.

JAPAN IS FLEXING ITS MILITARY MUSCLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (kd) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ When Japan fired warning shots at suspicious boats that
ventured into its territorial waters last month, it was the
clearest signal to date that this staunchly pacifist country is
taking its gloves off.
</P>
<P>
   There is a new willingness to assume a public role in regional
defense that Japan has long shunned because of its militarist past
and the fears of neighbors it once threatened.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese legislators are openly talking about once-taboo
possibilities such as building first-strike capabilities and
putting Japanese troops in peacekeeping operations that would
expose them to combat. There are plans to buy new weapons, and
there is a heated debate about loosening restrictions on Japan's
military support for the United States in the region. There is a
renewed sense of vulnerability, too, about threats from North Korea
and even China.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government has gained the confidence and courage to speak
out about the need for a strong defense, and that's a very big
change,'' said Kenzo Yoneda, a legislator from the governing
Liberal Democratic Party who has taken a leading role in pushing
for Japanese forces to gain first-strike capability. ``The taboo on
the discussion of defense is fading.''
</P>
<P>
   The issues of defense and, more broadly, what defines the
Japanese nation, are now being debated broadly and heatedly. ``We
are increasingly concerned as a nation that our basic defense
system is inadequate,'' Yoneda said.
</P>
<P>
   The government has authorized the purchase of four sophisticated
reconnaissance satellites for deployment by 2002, and despite
China's strenuous objections, it has agreed to pay a significant
part of the research and development expenses related to building a
missile defense system for the region.
</P>
<P>
   Discussions are under way about plans to buy airborne refueling
equipment and to outfit assault ships with decks that would allow
helicopters and Harrier-type aircraft to land in mid-sea.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition Democratic Party, normally somewhat dovish, has
established a study group to come up with a policy on North Korea
that is likely to include proposals for strengthening Japan's
defense.
</P>
<P>
   For most of Japan's postwar years, Article 9 of the
constitution, which forbids all military activity except
self-defense, was sacrosanct. Now talk about changing it has
evolved from the demands of a handful of right-wing legislators to
a serious give-and-take that many feel may indeed lead to
amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a real move away from what might be considered a
pure hedgehog defense,'' said Richard J. Samuels, an expert on
Japanese defense matters and head of the Japan program at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ``In full public view,
there's this whole set of measures that the Japanese government is
taking _ sometimes with America's support, sometimes at its request
and sometimes despite its consternation _ to shift away from a
strictly defensive defense.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   To be sure, there is still a great deal of traditional
ambivalence surrounding the subject of the military here, where
many still harbor memories of the imperialistic militarism that
brought Japan into World War II and made it the scourge of its
neighbors. That ambivalence is reflected in the debate under way in
Parliament over revisions to the military guidelines that govern
cooperation between Japanese and American forces in the region,
forcing Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi and others to hint that they
may have to water down the proposed changes to get them passed.
</P>
<P>
   As they stand, the revisions would enable the Self-Defense
Forces, Japan's army, to support American troops in ``areas
surrounding Japan,'' as well as offer logistical support,
search-and-rescue operations and inspections of suspect ships. In
other words, if sparks fly in the Taiwan Strait or between North
and South Korea, Japanese forces would be required to play a
substantial supporting role.
</P>
<P>
   More than 45,000 American troops are stationed in Japan,
including an aircraft carrier and a Marine division, but the old
guidelines are sketchy on Japan's obligations to support those
troops in the event of a military crisis in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Americans regard the changes as long overdue, an effort to make
Japan shoulder responsibility for its own defense.
</P>
<P>
   But many Japanese consider the changes a sign of the waning
American interest in attending to Japan's defense concerns now that
the Cold War is over. If Japan becomes more militarily powerful,
the argument goes, it will force the United States to stay involved
in the region, if only to keep an eye on what the Japanese are
doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``China and North Korea are not really the direct cause of the
increased interest in enhancing defense capabilities,'' said
Masanori Nishi, an official at the Defense Facilities
Administration Agency. ``They're a type of reasonable excuse.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The real worry is that the American commitment or the logic
behind the American participation in the maintaining regional
stability is shaky, that it's necessary to encourage and support
American interest in the Far East,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   North Korea is helping in that effort. The two ships the
Japanese chased this week are believed to have been sent by North
Korea, which has become increasingly bellicose.
</P>
<P>
   In August, North Korea sent a projectile known as the Taepodong
soaring toward Tokyo. It ultimately landed in the Pacific Ocean,
but it riveted the attention of the Japanese public on the issue of
defense in a way that little else has.
</P>
<P>
   In that sense, the Taepodong was the biggest boon that
proponents of a stronger Japanese military policy have had in
years. Former Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, regarded as one of
the more hawkish members of Japan's political elite, has even joked
privately that he is so grateful for that incident that he half
considered sending Kim Jong Il, the North Korean leader, a present
for his birthday this year.
</P>
<P>
   How much of a threat the Taepodong posed to Japan remains in
question. The North Koreans contend that it involved a satellite
launching, a contention supported by American intelligence but
countered by Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Japan's moves, though, have alarmed its neighbors. The
Chinese government strenuously objects to Japan's planned
investment in a missile defense system, which is likely to cast its
umbrella over Taiwan, and was angry about recent remarks by a
senior Japanese politicians suggesting that the revised guidelines
would include China and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea, too, has misgivings, although it also shares with
Japan concerns about North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Some Japanese are also concerned, pointing to the similarities
between Japan's current economic woes and a depression in the early
1930s, which was brought to an end in 1935 by a rise of militarism
that pulled the economy out of its slump, fueled a brutal, regional
imperialism and ultimately led Japan into World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The parallels are immediately dismissed by those who note that
the government would have to invest vast sums of money and overcome
overwhelmingly negative public sentiment to achieve a buildup even
remotely similar to that of the early Showa era.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's nonsense,'' Motoo Shina, a legislator known for his
interest in defense matters, said of the comparison of eras. He
said Japanese business and financial interests were too widespread
now to allow the country to embark on a military adventure on
anything like the scale it did in the past. ``Look at our current
army,'' he said. ``Probably we'd even have trouble occupying
Guam.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the government recently said the four
reconnaissance satellites it intends to have in place by 2002 would
be made by Japanese manufacturers from Japanese components, which
suggests that there might be at least a bit of an economic element
to the current hawkish noises emanating from Japan. American
defense manufacturers often rely on components made abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Others say Japan's military abilities are already more
substantial than many people realize. Even though Japan has
officially spent no more than 1 percent of its gross domestic
product on defense since the 1960s, the sheer size of its economy
means that it is the second- or third-biggest spender after the
United States. Most experts contend that its real spending levels
are obscured by the practice of deferring payments for weapons
systems, shifts in exchange rates and the difficulty in assessing
how much the private sector is investing in de facto defense
production.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at Japanese defense issues from year to year, it
doesn't change much; it's pretty boring,'' said Masashi Nishihara,
a professor at the National Defense Academy. ``But if you look at
it over a five-year period, there's a big difference. No one has
paid much attention to it until last summer, but now that people
are looking, they've found out a lot has changed.''

PRODUCTION PROBLEMS LEAD TO DIP IN GM'S MARCH SALES 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By MICHELLE KREBS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ General Motors Corp. missed out on sizzling vehicles
sales in March, reporting Wednesday that its car and truck sales
fell more than 2 percent from those in the month a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Every automaker except GM, Mazda and Suzuki reported higher
sales in March, and some set March and first-quarter records.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had forecast a 2 percent gain, but GM said its total
sales fell 2.2 percent in March, to 458,345 cars and trucks,
compared with sales in the period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter, GM's car and truck sales rose 5.9 percent. GM's
share of the U.S. car and truck market stood at 29.6 percent in
March, according to Morgan &AMP; Co., an automotive research and
forecasting firm in West Olive, Mich. That is down from 32.7
percent last year and below the automaker's goal of 32 percent for
the year.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of GM fell $4.375, or nearly 5 percent, to $86.6875.
</P>
<P>
   Roy S. Roberts, GM's vice president and group executive for
North American vehicle sales, service and marketing, said he hoped
GM would end the year ``somewhere north of 30 percent'' for market
share.
</P>
<P>
   He attributed lower March sales to several factors, including
problems in GM's vehicle-ordering system for dealers, the
reorganization in January of GM's field operation, which assists
dealers, and shipping problems in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Most significant, however, GM's sales of trucks, the hottest
part of the vehicle market, dropped 5.9 percent in March compared
with sales in the month a year earlier. The sales decrease was
largely a result of GM's inability to maintain production of its
new full-size Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck to keep up with
demand.
</P>
<P>
   GM has been unable to make up truck production lost last summer
during a two-month strike at two parts plants in Michigan that
closed almost all of GM's North American assembly plants.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts estimated GM could have sold 15,000 more full-size
pickup trucks had it been able to produce them. Sales of GM's small
pickup trucks also declined, company officials said, because of
heavy incentives offered by competitors. Still, GM plans to build
250,000 more trucks this year than last year.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the strength of its new compact Oldsmobile Alero and
Pontiac Grand Am and its new midsized cars, like the Buick Regal
and Century, GM's March car sales rose 1.1 percent, to 251,539
vehicles, even though it is selling three fewer models than it was
a year ago. However, sales of GM's large cars and luxury
automobiles, another hot part of the market, fell.
</P>
<P>
   Cadillac, which held onto the luxury-vehicle leadership only by
instituting a year-end sales blitz in 1998, had a 15.7 percent
sales decline in March. Cadillac ranked fifth behind Lincoln,
Mercedes-Benz, Lexus and BMW in luxury-vehicle sales for the month
and the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Though Cadillac added the Escalade, a full-size sport utility
vehicle, to its lineup to compete against the phenomenally
successful Lincoln Navigator this year, Cadillac car sales across
the board, including the relatively new flagship Seville, were down
in March and for the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   GM, along with other automakers, vastly underestimated the
strength of vehicle sales for the first quarter and planned its
production accordingly. Instead of the market selling at an annual
rate of 15.2 million vehicles as GM had predicted, the market ran
at a rate of nearly 17 million vehicles in the quarter, said Mike
DiGiovanni, GM's chief forecaster.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, at the start of 1999, GM forecasters predicted annual
sales would total between 15 million and 15.5 million cars and
trucks. They have since increased their forecast to about 15.7
million.
</P>
<P>
   In total, automakers sold 1,536,258 cars and light trucks in
March, up 7.8 percent compared with results in the same month a
year earlier, according to Morgan &AMP; Co. Sales for the quarter
increased 10 percent above the period a year earlier.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Very few people outside of Baghdad remember the
name of Layla al-Attar. But President Clinton does.
</P>
<P>
   She was the first civilian killed by a military strike ordered
by Clinton, a cruise missile attack on downtown Baghdad in June
1993 that the president authorized to retaliate for a failed Iraqi
plot to assassinate former President Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Attar, a celebrated Iraqi painter, was crushed under a
house demolished by a misguided American missile. Four of the 23
cruise missiles fired into Baghdad to destroy the headquarters of
Iraq's intelligence service veered into a residential area. The
attack killed eight civilians, including Mrs. Attar's husband and
one of her children.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, the death of Mrs. Attar haunts the president, a man
who now wears the mantle of commander in chief more comfortably
than he did in mid-1993, but who, his aides say, still agonizes
over bringing death to innocents.
</P>
<P>
   A former top foreign policy adviser to the president said that
Clinton has learned over the years to separate his personal
feelings from his leadership responsibilities. But it was a
hard-won lesson.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has moved, for good or ill, toward not taking each death so
individually and so personally,'' this adviser said, speaking on
the condition of anonymity. ``He still orders civilian casualties
be kept to a minimum, but there has been a change in the confidence
with which he gives orders. He has become commander in chief; he
was still feeling his way in 1993.''
</P>
<P>
   This former adviser said that Clinton had developed a ``switch''
that allows him to turn off his concern not only for the lives of
civilians but for American troops as well.
</P>
<P>
   He said that Clinton is troubled by pictures, like those in
today's newspapers, of civilians whose homes were destroyed by
errant American weapons. He is also deeply troubled by the fate of
American servicemen he sends into combat, including the three
soldiers captured by Serbian troops on the Macedonia-Yugoslavia
border last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your heart gets torn apart when you see things like this, and
then you have to switch it off and put your mind in gear and
calculate it the best you can,'' the adviser said. ``The main
criteria has to be how many lives you save each way, knowing you
will be responsible for the loss of some lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Current aides portray Clinton today as confident and decisive in
dealing with military matters, in contrast to the tentative and
brooding president of his first year in office, when the Baghdad
bombing and the loss of 18 Army Rangers in Somalia unnerved him.
They say he conducts the daily meetings on the Kosovo crisis
crisply, reviewing target lists and requests from commanders in
Europe for new war-fighting equipment.
</P>
<P>
   He authorized the dispatch of 24 Apache attack helicopters to go
after Serbian tanks in Kosovo after a very brief discussion on
Saturday, a senior White House official said. On Friday, he
``almost instantaneously'' approved attacks on a set of targets
that included buildings in Belgrade and other large Yugoslav
cities, despite warnings that the strikes almost certainly would
result in some ``collateral damage,'' a military euphemism for
civilian deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say that he has undergone a conversion on the
question of civilian casualties,'' said Joe Lockhart, the
president's press secretary. ``But he knows that, even when you
have taken all the precautions, they are still part of this kind of
operation. He keeps telling people: `Don't worry about that. Worry
about what we have to do.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But critics say that while Clinton may show tactical skill at
managing the Kosovo conflict day to day, that is all he is doing _
keeping a potential strategic disaster under control 24 hours at a
time.
</P>
<P>
   The primary goals Clinton set for the Kosovo operation _ to
prevent a human catastrophe, to keep the war from spreading and to
establish an autonomous, democratic Kosovo _ are all in danger of
failing. His vow to avoid the use of American ground troops may
have to be reconsidered within days if Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic continues to withstand NATO's bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Clinton and his aides have not yet devised a plan that looks
beyond next week, a ``Plan B'' to pursue if the current air
campaign fails.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the outset,'' said Sen. Robert G. Torricelli, D-N.J.,
``this operation never had more vision than the next day.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has handcuffed himself by ruling out ground troops and
by an excessive concern for loss of life that is not shared by his
adversaries in Belgrade, said George C. Edwards III, director of
the Center for Presidential Studies at Texas A&AMP;M University. If the
stakes in the Balkans are as high as the president says they are,
Edwards argued, then he should be willing to commit the forces
necessary to do the job and to accept the destruction that
accompanies a full-fledged military campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody wants innocent people or American soldiers being
killed,'' Edwards said. ``But the emotional component has overcome
thinking through the steps that may need to be taken. When you tell
people `We're going to do this, but not that,' and then ultimately
you have to change direction, that doesn't give people confidence
in your leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``These limitations are a product of Clinton's desire
to make this operation as popular, or at least as palatable, as
possible. He believes if he rules out ground troops, people won't
believe we're going to war.''

   SECOND INTERMISSION
</P>
<P>
   Not all ladies' rooms are created equal. Restrooms in bars such
as USA Cafe _ where women have been drinking alcohol, where the
goal might be to ``hook up'' or at least spark some interest in a
potential partner _ are vastly different from a bathroom, say, at a
museum.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Saturday afternoon at the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort
Worth, a steady stream of women waited _ and waited _ for the
restroom. Most never spoke; if they did, it was to a friend.
</P>
<P>
   In one instance, two women angrily but quietly discussed the
behavior of a man they both knew. ``I am so sick of his attitude,''
one woman commented.
</P>
<P>
   Their conversation represents one way women's relationships
differ when they are in intimate, female-only spaces, says Beth
Anne Shelton, director of the women's studies program at the
University of Texas at Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just because there are no men around,'' Shelton says,
noting that there are plenty of occasions when women are alone, in
restaurants or at work, and that this kind of interaction still
won't occur. The reason it happens in women's rooms is ``that it is
a female-only space,'' she adds, ``a safe space.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you see two things (in women's rooms),'' Shelton says.
``Women sort of forget about the gender scripts of appropriate
behavior. They are less genteel, they talk about more personal
things, things that in other contexts might be viewed as somewhat
embarrassing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, a lot of their hostility toward men comes out. I don't
mean women really hate men and when they go in the bathroom it all
comes out. But often men are the butt of the jokes. It's not women
being disdainful, but the ways in which men are different are
commented upon.''
</P>
<P>
   The only other audible comments in the Kimbell ladies' room that
afternoon were about appearance _ another unifying factor for
women.
</P>
<P>
   ``She cut too many layers,'' one petite blonde noted to another
petite blonde while both fixed their hair in the mirror. ``I told
her not to cut so many layers.''
</P>
<P>
   The women observed in restrooms at the 8.0 restaurant, the Pig &AMP;
Whistle Pub, USA Cafe and the Kimbell all showed respect for one
another. They shared makeup, complimented clothing, boosted one
another's egos and handed toilet paper from stall to stall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It becomes a forum for self-deprecating yourself and
complimenting your friends,'' says Catheryn Koss, a 25-year-old
from Oklahoma City. Koss and Austinite Jenna Martin, 25, had been
in the Kimbell restroom briefly discussing Martin's bad-hair day.
</P>
<P>
   Martin recalled a time she struck up a conversation with a woman
in the bathroom of a furniture store after noting that the woman's
perfume was the same brand Martin's mother wore. ``It just totally
opened her up to me,'' Martin says.
</P>
<P>
   The ladies' room might be the great equalizer among women,
Shelton suggests. ``In a sense, a lot of what women are doing in
the bathroom is preparing for the outside world,'' she says. ``So
there is a recognition that your true essence is exposed in the
bathroom ... which serves to diminish distinctions among women.''
</P>
<P>
   Mondell's most surprising discovery, she says, was how gender
issues spanned generations of women, from high schoolers to the
elderly. ``There really is something that binds us,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ACT 3: At 11:45 p.m., Amy and Ashley return to the USA Cafe's
ladies' room along with Kelli, who carries an athletic bag full of
bikini tops and bottoms. The three rummage through the bag, grab a
handful of Lycra and pile into stall No. 2. Several other women in
the bathroom _ Sandy, Dominique and Pamela _ also have begun
changing into bathing suits.
</P>
<P>
   Amy, still in the stall: ``OK, I'm stripping!''
</P>
<P>
   Ashley, searching for her bikini bottom: ``Where's the bottom to
the white one?''
</P>
<P>
   In a few seconds the women pile out of the stall. Amy is wearing
a red, tie-dyed two-piece with fashionable trunk bottoms; Ashley
has on a floral yellow and orange suit, which looks like a
Victorian wedding gown next to Sandy's leopard-print, itsy-bitsy
thong number. Sandy, a very pretty women who works at Hooters,
begins covering her exposed parts with baby oil.
</P>
<P>
   Ashley, staring a Sandy's ample chest: ``Can I ask you, are
those fake?''
</P>
<P>
   Sandy, nonplused: ``Yeah.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashley: ``Darn. I want mine to look that good.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandy: ``Baby, you have (breasts). I was a double-A before I got
this done.''
</P>
<P>
   Amy, who meanwhile has changed into a more daring French-cut
bikini like Ashley's: ``Ashley, have you ever imagined this. I'm
half-naked in front of the whole world!''
</P>
<P>
   Ashley, lifting her face toward Kelli, who is brushing blush on
Ashley's cheeks: ``You look good, Amy. ... This is crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandy, to Ashley: ``She looks like Barbie. Baby, you don't need
more blush.''
</P>
<P>
   Amy, who doesn't normally smoke: ``I need a cigarette.''
</P>
<P>
   The women are escorted out of the restroom, offstage, each
wearing a short, sheer robe. Moblike catcalls, cheering and
applause can be heard over the beat of the music each time the
bathroom door opens.
</P>
<P>
   The lights dim as one last women enters the now-empty ladies'
room.
</P>
<P>
   Woman 6: ``God. I hate my hair.''

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ACT 1
</P>
<P>
   We first meet Ashley and Amy, our protagonists, in the ladies'
room at USA Cafe, a swinging singles spot in downtown Fort Worth.
It's a Wednesday night, and the club is kicking off its Spring
Break '99 party, which includes, among other hallowed events, a
midnight bikini contest.
</P>
<P>
   The room is packed with pods of aimlessly wandering males,
grasping beer bottles, and lip-glossed females in Lycra clothing.
The DJ is spinning the Commodores' ``Brick House:''/ ``She's
mightay, mightay, just lettin' it all hang out ...''
</P>
<P>
   Ashley and Amy _ two attractive, petite coeds who attend a
nearby private university _ are here by default. Their tropical
cruise fell through at the last minute, so they've tagged along for
the evening with Ashley's big sister, Kelli, and Kelli's husband.
At approximately 10:30 p.m., Ashley, Amy and Kelli remove
themselves from the chaos and huddle in the women's restroom.
</P>
<P>
   Ashley: ``He's a sophomore, but he's 21.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelli: ``What about the other one?''
</P>
<P>
   Amy: ``They're cute, they're both cute, but I don't like it when
he does this.'' (She lifts her arms over her head and thrusts her
hips around spastically.)
</P>
<P>
   Kelli: ``Yeah. And his teeth are all messed up.''
</P>
<P>
   They all agree the teeth are a problem, and after a brief check
of their own appearance, quickly file out of the restroom. Just
then, Woman 1 enters the ladies' room and walks to the mirror. She
tousles her bangs.
</P>
<P>
   Woman 1, frowning: ``Fluorescent lights _ the worst possible
thing you could put in a bathroom.''
</P>
<P>
   Woman 2, also frowning: ``My hair is, like, huge.''
</P>
<P>
   Fade to black.
</P>
<P>
   FIRST INTERMISSION
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Salzman Mondell's fascination with public restrooms
developed decades ago. When Mondell was a child, a momentarily
confused aunt led her into a men's lavatory. The rows of white
porcelain urinals awed the sheltered 6-year-old. ``What,'' she
asked her aunt, ``are all these fountains?''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Mondell would become an independent filmmaker based in
Dallas who would turn her lens toward the same subject, albeit a
different gender. ``The Ladies Room,'' her 1998 documentary, takes
an unflinching look at how women relate to one another in the
closed quarters of restrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Mondell contends that women speak more frankly and freely in the
ladies' room than in mixed (i.e., male-female) company. The
documentary portrays ladies' rooms as sanctuaries of a sort, where
female camaraderie blossoms and where women feel safe letting down
their emotional guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We relate to each other in a very unique way in the
bathroom,'' Mondell says, ``because there are no male rules.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Mondell began camping out in women's restrooms with a
small-format video camera, a microphone and a pretty good notion of
what she might find. She filmed scenes in more than 25 Texas
restrooms over the course of five years, camping out in places like
the ladies' rooms of the Dallas Museum of Art, J.J. Pearce High
School in Richardson, the YWCA, the Jewish Community Center, Dick's
Last Resort restaurant, a lesbian bar, and several hotels.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a pastiche of blunt repartee about sex, men, hair,
sex, mothers, eating, sex, harassment and relationships. Did we
mention sex?
</P>
<P>
   Mondell organizes the conversations under themes: ``Dating,''
``Bathroom Therapy,'' ``Mother Knows Best,'' ``Mr. Wrong,'' etc.
Her camera captured sometimes hilarious and sometimes moving
interactions between friends as well as total strangers.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, Mondell introduces a discussion group of
twentysomethings and fortysomethings that spontaneously forms in
one gleaming white restroom and generates this remark: ``I'm
involved with someone who's 19 years younger than I am,'' says a
woman in a black hat. ``He's real flexible, and that's what I like.
I've told people, I can't imagine dating 40-year-old men. They're
like half dead.''
</P>
<P>
   In another scene, a woman finds solace from two others she's
never met when she begins talking about her failing marriage. The
pseudo-therapy session ends in tears and hugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been fascinated with how you can make a friend for
the period of time you're in the bathroom,'' Mondell says. ``You're
not necessarily friends when you leave that space, but for those
minutes ...''
</P>
<P>
   In another scene, prom girls complain about their dates, like
the ``Texas Tech dumb jock'' who wore cowboy boots with his suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``My date?'' says one lovely young woman, speaking directly to
the camera, ``I hope he drowns.''
</P>
<P>
   ACT 2
</P>
<P>
   At 11 p.m., the women's restroom has become increasingly
crowded. Space in front of the mirrors that stretch over two sinks
is especially coveted. Staring at their reflections, the women
primp, applying lip liner and face powder, pulling miniature
bottles of hair spray from their purses, tousling their bangs,
flipping their heads, yanking down and hiking up various articles
of clothing. They purchase single cigarettes, sticks of gum or a
single application of lipstick from Leticia, the conscientious
ladies' room attendant who sits with a roll of paper towels in her
hands.
</P>
<P>
   A woman named Lisa has locked herself into stall No. 3, head
slumped over the toilet. When two female strangers come to retrieve
her (as a favor to the men outside the ladies' room who have been
calling Lisa's name for 15 minutes), they notice that Lisa has some
tissue paper protruding from her brassiere. They hurriedly tuck the
offending stuffing back from whence it came.
</P>
<P>
   It is into this scene that Ashley and Amy burst yet again,
laughing and breathless. The duo make a beeline to the empty stall
for the disabled and disappear. Much hilarity emanates from within.
</P>
<P>
   Narrator, entering stage left: By now, Ashley's brother-in-law
has persuaded our two protagonists to enter the bikini contest;
he's already left to retrieve a drawer-full of bikinis from
Ashley's house. With only one other person signed up and cash
prizes for the top three entrants, Ashley and Amy see an
opportunity for some quick cash. But who will wear which bathing
suit?
</P>
<P>
   Amy: ``I'm worried about the butt on the white one. How much
does it cover?''
</P>
<P>
   Ashley: ``Don't worry about it. You just won't turn around.''

DISPUTED REPORT RATES MASS., N.J. ROADS AMONG POOREST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS C. PALMER JR.  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- A university research group that regularly compares
transportation systems nationwide has ranked the Massachusetts and
New Jersey highway departments as the least efficient in the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   The University of North Carolina at Charlotte's Center for
Interdisciplinary Transportation Studies said that highway
management was most efficient in Western and Southern states. The
study's conclusions were based on five financial measures, such as
maintenance costs, and seven performance ratings, such as levels of
congestion and accident rates.
</P>
<P>
   For the six years covered by the last federal highway funding
bill, the study found, North Dakota and Wyoming got the most for
their money; New York, Hawaii, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and New
Jersey got the least, the report found.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts and Louisiana were the only states that spent more
on administration than on maintenance, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   But Massachusetts highway commissioner Matt Amorello spared no
adjectives in denouncing the study. ``This is a pointy-headed
intellectual in North Carolina compiling a report filled with
misleading bunk,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Amorello said states' different conditions and ways of keeping
records cannot be compared. He said the North Carolina professor
who conducted the study, David T. Hartgen, compared six-lane
highways in Massachusetts with one-lane highways elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't do that,'' said Amorello, adding that Massachusetts,
unlike some other states, includes pension costs in its
administrative budget. ``It's just hokum to sell reports and
probably make some money for UNC.''
</P>
<P>
   A national organization of highway departments has also taken
issue with the North Carolina center's approach in the past.

POLICE TO SEEK AGGRESSIVE DRIVERS ON HOUSTON FREEWAYS &HT;    
 &HT;   
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    By S.K. BARDWELL 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The Houston Police Department and the Metropolitan
Transit Authority Police on Wednesday launched an initiative aimed
at improving traffic safety on area freeways.
</P>
<P>
   A team of officers from both departments will be assigned to a
different freeway from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. each weekday, said Houston
Police Chief C.O. Bradford.
</P>
<P>
   Bradford said the teams will target ``speeders and aggressive
drivers who act out more between rush hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're dangerous and they provoke many complaints from
citizens. Seeing more officers on the freeway should slow down some
of them and make the roads safer for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Metro Police Chief Tom Lambert said while the main goal of the
program is safety, ``We're also looking to improve mobility. And
nothing grinds mobility to a halt faster than accidents.''
</P>
<P>
   Unmarked cars also will be used to target aggressive drivers on
the city's freeways, Bradford said Wednesday, and patrol officers
have been asked to spend their uncommitted time enforcing traffic
laws on freeways in their beats.
</P>
<P>
   About two weeks ago, HPD assigned all 40 of the motorcycle
officers in its Solo Division to focus on inspecting 18-wheelers on
the city's freeways, and HPD Lt. E.J. Smith said that move has
increased the number of truck inspections from about 100 per month
to 100 per week.
</P>
<P>
   The most common problems being found, said Smith, are bald
tires, missing mud flaps, leaking brake fluid, loads that are too
heavy, wide or high, or problems with manifests or driver's
licenses _ all violations of regulations that can be enforced by
any police officer.
</P>
<P>
   HPD's efforts to beef up highway safety come on the heels of two
particularly deadly traffic accidents on Interstate 45.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 12, four people died on the Gulf Freeway when an
18-wheeler ran into the back of a chain-reaction collision caused
by a car. On March 16, three people died on the North Freeway when
a tanker truck lost control and veered into oncoming traffic.

NICKLAUS HOPES TO PLAY IN JUNE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ Jack Nicklaus arrived at Augusta National GC
Tuesday, was taken on a tour of the course by Masters tournament
chairman Hootie Johnson, hit a shot into the par-3 12th green and
said he is hoping to play in the Memorial Tournament at the course
he designed in Dublin, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Just over two months after undergoing hip replacement surgery in
New England Baptist Hospital in Boston, Nicklaus has discarded the
cane he was using when he visited the Doral Open on March 4-5. He
now says he feels on schedule to play a tuneup event prior to the
Memorial (June 3-6) and may eye the three remaining major
championships.
</P>
<P>
   After attending Tuesday's past champions dinner, Nicklaus left
Augusta for his home in Hobe Sound, Fla., missing the Masters for
the first time since he played in the 1959 event as an amateur.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus's physical problems began to mount last fall and
intensified to the point that he decided to undergo surgery in
Boston. In a remarkable recovery the past week, he went from
exercising in a swimming pool to playing four rounds of golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to the doctor this morning,'' said Nicklaus. ``He
said, `Go ahead and push it a little more. You'll find out what you
can do and what you can't do. Your body will tell you. I'll be
playing pretty solidly probably within the next two or three weeks,
and I think I'll make the Memorial. I might even play the week
before to get a little practice. Right now, the hardest thing is
walking the nine then playing 18 in a cart to see the difference.''

   Nicklaus started to talk of maybe the US Open at Pinehurst No.
2, the British Open at Carnoustie, and the PGA Championship at
Medinah. ``I'm 59,'' he said, ``and I'm certainly not going to
compete against the kids anymore. I feeI I'm not going to be that
competitive, but I didn't do this operation for golf. I did it more
so my wife didn't have to put up with me and having my hip dominate
my life.''
</P>
<P>
   What do his colleagues feel about playing the Masters without
Nicklaus? ``It's like your wife losing the diamond out of a wedding
ring,'' said Greg Norman. ``He put the Masters on the map for the
modern-day player. He is it, the Masters. it will be a sad weekend
without him.''

ROBINSON'S FATE TO BE DETERMINED AFTER SEASON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Coach Larry Robinson's future with the Los
Angeles Kings will be determined after the season, which almost
certainly will end on April 18, with the team out of the playoffs
for the third time in his four years on the job.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the Kings decide they would like Robinson to return
next season, Robinson said Wednesday he is not certain he wants to
be back. ``I don't know,'' Robinson said following practice as his
team prepared for tonight's home game against the San Jose Sharks.
``It's been a tough year. When even my wife is finding it tough, I
don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearing the end of a season that began with great optimism, the
Kings are a dismal 28-43-5, and almost certainly would have to
finish 6-0 to have any chance at all of squeaking into the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Kings management has deferred all decisions on personnel and
coaching until after the season. Robinson, whose tenure with his
team is longer than all NHL coaches other than Detroit's Scotty
Bowman and Edmonton's Ron Low, is in the final year of his
contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I think about it,'' Robinson said when asked if he's
been contemplating the fact that these could be his final days as
the Kings' coach. ``But it's not something I let keep me up at
night. What keeps me up at night is that we're not winning hockey
games.''
</P>
<P>
   Of his uncertain status, he added, ``It's not just me going
through it. We're a close family: (assistants Jay) Leach, (Rick)
Green, (Don) Edwards. We spend a lot of time trying to find ways to
make the team win. It's very draining on all of us, not just me.
Their jobs are at stake, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson dismissed a recent report in the Toronto Sun saying
he's been telling friends he plans to take next year off and spend
it on his farm in Florida. He did say that he has discussed with
General Manager Dave Taylor the possibility of taking another
position in the Kings' organization if he isn't back as coach.
Robinson said he would enjoy working at developing prospects if he
wasn't the coach.
</P>
<P>
   He admitted the season has worn him down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talk to some of my friends back home,'' he said. ``They ask
me, `How are you?' I say, `Why?' They say, `Because you look
awful.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I never looked at whether I wanted to do (coach next year)
until my mother passed away (five weeks ago). At Christmas, I
talked to mom, and the first thing she said was `When are you
coming home?' It's sad, it was the last Christmas I had to spend
with her, and I wasn't there.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, at 47, Robinson said he wants to remain involved in
hockey.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm to leave this position, it's not to get out of the
game,'' he said. ``I still love the game.''
</P>
<P>
   LOOSE PUCKS: The Kings recalled winger Jason Podollan and goalie
Manny Legace from the Long Beach Ice Dogs and returned goalie Ryan
Bach to Long Beach. Podollan was acquired two weeks ago from
Toronto for center Yanic Perreault, and is expected to be in the
lineup tonight, his debut as a King. The moves with the goaltenders
are the result of an ankle sprain suffered by Jamie Storr last
week. ... Defenseman Garry Galley probably will miss the final six
games because of an abdominal strain. The injury had bothered him
in recent games. Trainer Peter Demers said Galley will undergo
tests to determine the proper course of treatment, with surgery a
possibility.

POOR HOUSING HURTING CHILDREN, REPORT SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOLORES KONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The doctors and nurses taking care of a boy with a
serious liver disorder thought they had everything lined up last
year when they sent him home, including a feeding tube to deliver a
sugar solution he needed through the night.
</P>
<P>
   But what they didn't factor in were the rats in the
17-year-old's apartment.
</P>
<P>
   At 3 o'clock one morning, Jorge Martinez's mother woke up to the
sound of rats scurrying around. She found the rats had chewed
through her son's feeding tube, spilling the sugar solution out
onto the floor and sending his blood sugar level dangerously low.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called the ambulance,'' said Francisca Diaz, who works at a
nursing home as a nursing assistant, and is still looking for safe,
affordable housing for her and her son. ``He was shaking. His lips
were turning blue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything medically was in place,'' said Dr. Steven Chapman,
a pediatrician at the Greater Lawrence Family Health Center and one
of Jorge's providers, in recalling the incident. ``But what
happened is, they lived in an apartment that is just not a safe
place.''
</P>
<P>
   With the worsening housing crisis across the nation, children's
health is increasingly being threatened, according to the first
comprehensive national report about the crisis's impact on health.
</P>
<P>
   The story about Jorge joins others from Philadelphia, Seattle
and elsewhere in illustrating the growing problem chronicled by two
Boston Medical Center physicians and a San Francisco housing
advocate.
</P>
<P>
   Children are showing up at hospitals and doctors' offices with
rat bites, lead poisoning or asthma from exposure to cockroaches
and other pests, according to the report. Or they're going hungry
as more family income has to go to rent, rather than to nutritious
food. Or they're failing in school because their family has to
constantly move in search of housing.
</P>
<P>
   Across America, an estimated 14 million young children live in
housing with lead paint, and 10,000 children between the ages of 4
and 9 are hospitalized for asthma attacks each year because of
cockroach infestation, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are doctors interested in housing? People have trouble
understanding,'' said Dr. Megan Sandel, a pediatric resident at
Boston Medical Center and Children's Hospital, who along with
co-author Dr. Joshua Sharfstein brought Jorge's rat-bitten feeding
tube to a news conference, where the report was released.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a factor in my patients' lives. Not to consider it,
not to ask about it, ignores a facet of their life that impacts
their health. The best medical intervention that I can do for them
is to find better housing,'' said Sandel in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Last year one of her patients, an 18-month-old girl from the
Boston area, was hospitalized with internal bleeding in her lungs,
as a result of breathing toxins from a fungus growing in the
basement of her family's apartment. Luckily, she recovered, Sandel
said. Three children in Cleveland with the same housing-related
health problem died, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   But finding better affordable, safe housing around the country
has becoming increasingly difficult, as a result of cutbacks in
housing funds, coupled with skyrocketing rents.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1976 federal housing funds have been cut by 61 percent
nationally, including a drastic reduction in so-called Section 8
housing vouchers, according to Randy Shaw, a San Francisco attorney
and housing advocate, and director of Housing America, a national
initiative launched this year to address the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been no new Section 8 in three years,'' from 1996
through 1998, said Shaw. And the recent addition of 90,000 vouchers
for 1999 pales by comparison to the 200,000 new vouchers a year
that the federal government used to average.
</P>
<P>
   US Housing and Urban Development Secretary Andrew Cuomo welcomed
the report as bolstering his agency's concerns about the housing
shortage. Cuomo, whose agency published its own study last month
detailing the difficulty families have finding good homes they can
afford, said, ``This new report confirms our warning that there is
an affordable housing crisis in this country and further, its human
impact is unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   The new report calls for increased Section 8 vouchers,
protection of existing affordable housing units and an increased
low-income housing tax credit, among other steps.

HIGH-PROFILE WAR HOLDS FEW SECRETS, WORRYING SOME EXPERTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe

<P>
   ``All warfare is based on deception.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Chinese general Sun Tzu, ``The Art of War''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AVIANO AIR BASE, Italy _ Warriors through the ages have kept
their military tactics a closely guarded secret. Winston Churchill
called truth during warfare so precious that it must be shielded by
a bodyguard of lies.
</P>
<P>
   But the wisdom of war _ from Sun Tzu 2,500 years ago to
Churchill a half-century ago _ seems to have gone unheeded by NATO
in the high-tech age of military conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Day in and day out during the conflict in Kosovo, commanders
from NATO headquarters in Brussels to US brass at the Pentagon have
given detailed explanations of their targets and their strategy.
Each nightly takeoff of warplanes is announced; new phases of the
offensive are elaborated days before they are put into place.
</P>
<P>
   ``They talk too much _ plain and simple,'' said retired US Army
Major General William Nash, who served as a commander of troops in
Bosnia from 1995 to 1996 and now directs the Washington-based
National Democratic Institute for International Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (NATO and US military commanders) tell the media so much
that it loses meaning. The daily briefings are becoming cheerleader
sessions,'' said Nash, who taught a course on media and the
military at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. ``It makes it
all a bit awkward, and a bit dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of this is a sincere desire on the military's part to
cooperate with the media,'' he explained. ``And some of it is a new
vogue in international relations, which is to talk to the other
side through live television. When they spell out the details of
sustained attacks it is designed to send a message to Milosevic
that this thing won't be stopping. They are using the media.''
</P>
<P>
   But this spin doctoring in war, many critics feel, is
ill-advised and potentially dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Spurgeon Keeny, a National Security Council member under
Presidents Kennedy and Johnson and now president of the Arms
Control Association, said daily ``boasts'' by military leaders of
the successes of the awesome power and sophistication of America's
laser-guided arsenal could have a ``boomerang effect.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Gulf War was a television advertisement for America's
military competence. The world was amazed, and it projected a sense
of omnipotence. And we're doing the same thing again in Kosovo,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if we get mired down in the Balkans, there is a danger of
a secondary impact that exposes an American vulnerability. The bad
guys will ask, ``How come if these guys are so great, they can't
stop some ragtag Serbian troops on the ground?''
</P>
<P>
   A high-ranking American military officer with experience in the
Balkans expressed even graver concerns. He said he worries that
Milosevic is taking all this information in and quietly planning a
retaliatory strike that may catch the NATO forces by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not lighting up his air defense half as much as he could.
He's waiting. And I think all this transparency helps him in
that,'' the officer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said.
``It makes this triumphalism we see in the press conferences that
much more dangerous.''

<P>
   KIRKLARELI, Turkey _ Last week, Venera Limani, an 18-year-old
university student from Kosovo's capital, Pristina, lost her home
and all her belongings. Wednesday, on the border of Kosovo and
Macedonia, she lost her family.
</P>
<P>
   As she and hundreds of other refugees waited for buses headed
for the airport at Skopje, police began to separate the crowd at
random. Ms. Limani found herself being pushed forward as a
Macedonian policeman ordered her father and stepmother, three
brothers and a sister to step back.
</P>
<P>
   ``They pushed them away and I didn't see them again,'' she said.
``I cried out, but the police weren't interested if they were
family or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, like many other refugees at a Turkish military encampment
near the Bulgarian border, Ms. Limani is waiting to see if her
family shows up. She has made sure their names are registered on
the computer list, but there's little else she can do.
</P>
<P>
   For many of the 2,768 refugees who have been brought here over
the last two days, the relief of being out of the teeming refugee
centers on the Kosovo border has been spiked with bitterness and
worry at being separated from their families.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are families coming from Macedonia whose mother and
father have gone to Norway while the sons and daughters are in
Turkey,'' said Turkhan Kazaz, a Kosovo Turk from Prizren who
managed to arrive with his family intact. ``People are getting on
planes not knowing where they were going.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the crush of refugees and their increasingly desperate
state, some confusion was probably inevitable. But some of the
refugees said the Macedonian police made no effort to keep families
together or to inform people of where they were going.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't ask us, they just told us to get in the bus,''
said Ms. Limani. ``They would say, `you go, you go, you stay.' When
we got to the airport in Skopje, they said we were going to
Turkey.''
</P>
<P>
   Merita Shala, also from Pristina, was lucky. When they tried to
separate her from her mother, she began to scream. Her mother was
allowed to join her on the bus but her brother was left behind in
Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey, which has agreed to accept 20,000 refugees from Kosovo,
moved quickly to get the refugee encampment here ready in time.
Originally built for the exodus of ethnic Turks from Bulgaria in
the late 1980s, the camp was later used to house Muslims driven
from Bosnia during its 1992-95 war; 177 of them still remain. As of
Wednesday, 900 tents had been erected, out of a planned total of
1,500, and 400 prefabricated huts were filling up fast.
</P>
<P>
   On a warm spring evening, children clambered over swings and
jungle gyms, teen-age boys played basketball while their mothers
filled buckets with water to wash the few clothes the Kosovo
families brought with them.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the heavily guarded camps, clusters of people _ some of
them Kosovo Albanians who lived in Turkey for more than a
generation _ waited to greet their long-lost relatives. Inside
there was a line for the telephones but it was not that long.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have anywhere to call,'' said Ms. Limani.
</P>
<P>
   Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit paid the refugees a visit
Wednesday, promising both to help them while they are here and to
help them return home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call you our guests, not migrants, because we want you to
return to your homes as soon as possible,'' he told the cheering
crowd. ``We will do all we can to save your homeland from this
violence.''
</P>
<P>
   As they stood in line at dinner time to fill tin pots with
chicken and rice and their pockets with oranges, the refugees said
they were grateful for the Turks' warm welcome, particularly after
the nightmarish flight from their homes in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Turks are so kind, but home is home,'' said Ms. Shala.
``We all want to go back.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Limani said that if and when she does return to Pristina,
nothing will remain of her family's apartment. When Serbian police
arrived to order them out last week, the family was given no time
to collect their belongings, not even their documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told us, `you must go quickly, quickly, quickly,' '' she
recalled, ``so we couldn't take anything. Like everyone we want to
be back in our homes, but we don't know if there will be anything
left. If the Serbs can't have our homes, they will destroy them and
we will have nothing.''

RED NORVO, 91, EFFERVESCENT JAZZMAN, DIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (kd) 
 By PETER WATROUS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Red Norvo, one of jazz's early vibraphonists and a gifted band
leader whose groups greatly influenced American music and backed
singers like Mildred Bailey, Billie Holiday and Frank Sinatra, died
on Tuesday at a convalescent home in Santa Monica, Calif. He was
91.
</P>
<P>
   Norvo helped introduce the xylophone and later the vibraphone as
legitimate jazz instruments. But playing an unusual instrument was
not what earned him, early in his career, spots in some of jazz's
most important orchestras, including the groups of Paul Whiteman,
Benny Goodman, Charlie Barnet and Woody Herman. Norvo was a genuine
improviser, effervescent, intelligent and searching, and even his
early solos reflect a literate sensibility, embracing both the
classical and jazz worlds.
</P>
<P>
   A typical Norvo solo dived and turned, nudging the harmony with
astringent dissonances. He had a way of keeping his lines happy;
they bounced with a firm sense of swing. But underneath was an
element of darkness, an exploratory urge that led his
improvisations into corners where most improvisers would not
venture. On ``Blues a la Red,'' from 1944, Norvo's solo uses odd
figures and a streamlined swing that mixed perfectly: riffs and
lines and melodies all combining for a powerful statement.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Norvo, who was born Kenneth Norville in Beardstown, Ill., sold
his pet pony to help pay for his first instrument, a marimba. He
started his career in Chicago with a band called the Collegians in
1925. In the late 1920s he joined an all-marimba band, playing the
vaudeville circuit. (He also tap-danced and played xylophone.)
</P>
<P>
   He changed his name after a vaudeville announcer pronounced it
incorrectly, and it appeared that way in Variety. ``It stuck,'' he
told an interviewer, ``so I kept it.''
</P>
<P>
   When he graduated to the Whiteman orchestra, he met Bailey, a
singer in the band, whom he married in 1930; they were nicknamed
``Mr. and Mrs. Swing'' and remained together for 12 years. They
were still friends when Bailey died in 1951.
</P>
<P>
   The couple formed their own band in 1936, using the innovative
arranger Eddie Sauter to write much of their material. They had
several hits, including ``Rockin' Chair,'' ``Please Be Kind'' and
``Says My Heart,'' and their work was well respected by musicians,
who found the arrangements sophisticated.
</P>
<P>
   But Norvo was not simply producing pop music with his wife. He
was one of the earliest musicians to take refuge in the jazz clubs
that once lined West 52nd Street in Manhattan, and he worked there
at the Famous Door with a group that had neither a drummer nor a
piano. The group and the music it played helped set Norvo's
reputation as a leader with experimental ideas, a jazz musician who
like to play quietly. The music quickly came to be called chamber
jazz.
</P>
<P>
   In 1933, the year he first recorded under his own name, he
produced some of the most unusual recorded jazz of the time,
including Bix Beiderbecke's ``In a Mist'' and his own ``Dance of
the Octopus,'' using a group that included Benny Goodman on bass
clarinet and himself on marimba, accompanied by guitar and bass.
And he was cultivating his own bands, with a fine ear for talent.
In 1934 he led a group with Artie Shaw and Charlie Barnet as
sidemen, and recorded with Chu Berry, Teddy Wilson, Bunny Berigan
and Gene Krupa.
</P>
<P>
   Norvo offered a singing spot to Frank Sinatra in 1939, but he
turned them down as he had just signed a contract with Harry James.
Sinatra and Norvo remained friends, however, and the Norvo band
influenced Sinatra's music.
</P>
<P>
   In 1944 Norvo joined Benny Goodman's sextet, and a year later
played with the First Herd of Woody Herman, an orchestra that was
proud of its harmonic innovations. It was in the middle 1940s that
Norvo moved from the xylophone, an acoustic instrument, to the
vibraphone, an electrified version. At that point he undertook an
innovative recording project, merging some of the best of the
swing-era improvisers with the leaders of the be-bop movement,
Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie.
</P>
<P>
   The session, recorded for Comet records, included Norvo,
Gillespie on trumpet, Parker and Flip Phillips on saxophones, Teddy
Wilson on piano, Slam Stewart on bass and Specs Powell and J.C.
Heard on drums. They recorded ``Hallelujah,'' ``Get Happy,'' ``Slam
Slam Blues'' and ``Congo Blues,'' and the result was some of the
most highly regarded music of the era.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, having moved to California from New York with
his second wife, Eve Rogers, Norvo decided to form a small group.
(It was hard for him to find good musicians in California at that
time.) He brought together Tal Farlow on guitar and Red Kelly on
bass. The bassist Charles Mingus, who had worked with Norvo when
his group backed Billie Holiday, replaced Kelly in 1950, and the
three produced extremely light but swinging and complicated music
that was almost shocking in its virtuosity, full of rapid tempo
changes and sophisticated harmonies.
</P>
<P>
   The band, regarded as one of the finest small groups in jazz
history, recorded for two years; later trios included the guitarist
Jimmy Raney and the bassist Red Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   Norvo kept busy even during jazz's slack periods. He worked with
Goodman in 1959 and 1961, and recorded regularly in the late 1950s,
for Contemporary, Victory and Fantasy Records. And in 1957 he
resumed his relationship with Sinatra, who would come to Norvo's
shows at the Desert Inn in Palm Springs, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   A year later Sinatra hired Norvo for the Sands in Las Vegas. It
was there that Sinatra came up with the idea of touring with Norvo,
which they did in 1959. The association lasted nearly 20 years.
Sinatra liked to have Norvo and his band at the Sands, so that he
could perform with a jazz group whenever he wanted. Norvo often
toured under the auspices of the jazz entrepreneur George Wein as
well.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s Norvo suffered partial hearing loss after an
infection and compounded the problem at a shooting range when a gun
discharged next to his ear. Surgery and a hearing aid helped him
regain some hearing. Then in the 1970s, after his wife and one of
their two sons died within a short time, he stopped playing for two
years.
</P>
<P>
   He began to work again at a club in Las Vegas and for the rest
of his career kept recording and touring regularly. A stroke in the
mid-1980s, forced him into retirement, but even in his last years
his performances were often marvels of intelligent swinging.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by a daughter, Portia Corlin of Santa Monica; a
son, Mark, and one grandchild.

PROPOSAL OFFERED TO REPEAL TEXAS' `VEGGIE LIBEL' LAW &HT;    
 &HT;   
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Legislation that would repeal a 4-year-old ban
on false disparagement of perishable foods, better known as the
``veggie libel'' law, was formally presented to a House committee
on Wednesday amid predictions it wouldn't reach the full House.
</P>
<P>
   The law, used unsuccessfully in the 1998 trial that pitted
Panhandle cattlemen against talk show host Oprah Winfrey, allows
farmers and ranchers to pursue monetary damages if their products
are publicly maligned with false information.
</P>
<P>
   In Winfrey's case, a federal judge in Amarillo never ruled on
the constitutionality of the Texas law but decided that the
cattlemen could not rely on it in their lawsuit. Left with only
standard business libel protections, the cattlemen failed in their
bid to recover damages for cattle-market losses that they
attributed to a 1996 Winfrey broadcast dealing with dangerous foods
and ``mad cow'' disease.
</P>
<P>
   While Winfrey said the outcome was a victory for free speech,
cattlemen and farmers responded that Texas needs the law to allow
recovery of damages when the target of libel is a foodstuff, not a
person. A year later, the still-raging debate led Rep. Ruth Jones
McClendon, D-San Antonio, to submit a terse bill that repeals the
1995 law. She contends other libel laws are sufficient to protect
farmers and ranchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not an anti-agriculture bill. It has more to do with
preserving our rights to free speech than disputing the rights of
food,'' McClendon said. She said the law was passed with good
intentions, but ``is unfortunately so vague and ambiguous that its
merits are very, very questionable.''
</P>
<P>
   McClendon added that ``the veggie law stifles free speech by
people like Oprah Winfrey or you or me who may not mean to harm but
who are interested only in talking about public health and safety
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Winfrey declined an invitation to testify in favor of
McClendon's House Bill 126, but Tim Bennett of Chicago, president
of Winfrey's Harpo Productions, Inc., said Winfrey supports
McClendon's repeal bill because the food disparagement law is a
``catalyst for frivolous types of lawsuits.''
</P>
<P>
   He testified that Winfrey's attempt to air a helpful debate on
food safety resulted in a protracted court battle costing several
million dollars and a chilling effect on critics of food safety.
</P>
<P>
   But the law's author, Rep. Bob Turner, D-Voss, said it is
constitutional and serves an important purpose in protecting
agricultural interests without infringing on free speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bill has made some people give some serious thought to
facts and truth in what they say. It definitely has stopped or
slowed disparaging remarks. That's for sure, and that's all I
intended the bill to do,'' Turner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Oprah case had nothing to do with the bill, really. I
never dreamed there would be an Oprah case,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At issue in Winfrey's case were her vow not to eat beef and her
allowing a guest, vegetarian campaigner Howard Lyman, to
characterize beef as unsafe. Editing of the show was criticized as
unfair to the cattle industry.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL ADD END)
</P>
<P>
   Turner said he agrees with a suggestion of Rep. Harold Dutton,
D-Houston, to authorize a post-session study of the law to
determine if it needs ``tweaking,'' particularly its legal
definition of a ``perishable'' food product. The Amarillo federal
judge had questioned whether frozen sides of beef would qualify as
perishable.
</P>
<P>
   Turner predicted the House Civil Practices Committee, which left
McClendon's bill pending without taking a vote, would not send it
to the House floor because it would be greeted by significant
opposition from members who represent rural districts.
</P>
<P>
   Testifying against McClendon's repeal bill were dairymen,
cattlemen and agriculture groups.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Dutton said serious questions remain about the wisdom
of Turner's law.
</P>
<P>
   ``We protect broccoli better than we protect people in this
state,`` Dutton said.

CHINESE PREMIER'S US TOUR COMES AMID GROWING TENSIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES A. RADIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With anti-China criticism rising in Congress and resentment of
America spreading in China, Premier Zhu Rongji's current tour of
the United States could become the most important visit here by a
Chinese leader since Deng Xiaoping donned a 10-gallon hat at a
Texas rodeo in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   US-China relations have seesawed wildly in the intervening two
decades, from unbridled optimism through most of the 1980s to
hostility and confrontation for most of the 1990s. Human rights,
trade, and the balance of military power in East Asia all are areas
of friction not likely to be resolved any time soon. President
Clinton is a short-timer beset by critics.
</P>
<P>
   And so the Chinese have sent the most personable and pragmatic
of their top leaders to try to calm the roiling waters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This visit is very important because the atmospherics are so
bad and the relationship is spiraling downward,'' says Thomas
Christenson, a specialist on US-China relations at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where Zhu will speak next
Wednesday after stops in Washington, Denver, Chicago, and New York.
``When things are going well, summits are window dressing. When
things are really bad, that's when visits like this are most
important.''
</P>
<P>
   Zhu gave indications of what Americans could expect from him
even before he left Beijing, when a proliferation of accusations
that China was backsliding on its human rights commitments and
stealing US nuclear secrets led to speculation he would cancel the
trip.
</P>
<P>
   Despite predictions that ``my forthcoming visit is unlikely to
be successful,'' he added at a rare press conference: ``I will go
anyway to lend (Americans) a chance to vent their anger or
complaints.''
</P>
<P>
   William Alford, director of East Asia legal studies at Harvard
Law School, says this ``confirms what we heard about Zhu _ that he
is fearless, and smart enough to understand what this is about. The
major purpose of this trip may be the patching up, healing, playing
to the US audience.''
</P>
<P>
   The contrast between Zhu and Chinese President Jiang Zemin is
stark. Confronted by pro-Tibet demonstrators in Bern last month,
Jiang questioned Swiss officials' ability to run their country, and
told them they had lost a friend.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, when Jiang, the last Chinese leader to visit the
United States, appeared at Harvard in 1997, questions that he would
be asked from the audience had to be submitted and screened in
advance. Zhu's representatives told MIT officials the premier
wanted the questions following his speech to be completely open.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts note that the modern history of US-China relations
has been a cycle of over-enthusiastic warmings and disillusioned
chills, and that this has been particularly true in the Clinton
Administration. The president picked a fight even before his
election, vowing to use trade as a weapon to make China respect
human rights, then backed down when China refused to yield.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Clinton Administration has really exacerbated'' the
extreme swings in American attitudes toward China ``by mishandling
China policy for so long,'' Alford said. ``Clinton really oversold
how rosy things were (on his trip to China) last summer, for
domestic political reasons, and it was a disservice to public which
has come back to haunt us.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he had not oversold, and stayed closer to the underlying
reality,'' Alford said, ``the relationship would be less vulnerable
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton himself said, in a speech in Washington Wednesday, that
Chinese and Americans often holds extreme, inaccurate ideas of each
other's motives and policies, and argued that ``we have to follow a
different course.''
</P>
<P>
   But just as the Chinese had reason to help Clinton make his trip
last summer be seen as a success in the United States, whether it
actually was or not, the US now has an interest in having Zhu's
trip play as a success in China: The premier is seen as highly
intelligent, open to Western economic ways, and above the
corruption plaguing much of Chinese officialdom.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is tough, efficient, has a sense of humor, and is
self-deprecating,'' says Merle Goldman, a Boston University
professor who specializes in Chinese intellectual history. ``Of all
the Chinese leaders, he is the one with character traits which most
appeal to Americans. He is the best emissary they could send.''
</P>
<P>
   China specialists stress that the US-China relationship is bound
to be fraught with difficulties, given the enormous differences in
the two countries' histories, economies, and political systems.
But, they add, there are also common needs _ particularly for
market access and for political stability in northeast Asia _ which
provide strong incentives to both sides to do repair work when
relations fray too badly.
</P>
<P>
   Ezra Vogel, director of Harvard's Fairbank Center for East Asian
Research, suggests that the decision to persevere with the visit
despite the deepening problems ``reflects a decision in China that
even though relations will be on a bumpy road through the next (US
presidential election) it is important to keep them on track
nevertheless.''
</P>
<P>
   It is usual for the party out of the White House to criticize
the China policy of the sitting president, Vogel said, then to
learn to deal with China when it regains the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Chinese understand they are in for a tempest over
the next 15 months,'' Vogel said, ``and then things will get down
to business.''

NEW DATA ON BABIES OF WOMEN WITH BIRTH DEFECTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (kd) 
 By DENISE GRADY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new report from Norway describes the first large study to
provide information about the lives of women with birth defects,
and the health of their children: the women are less likely than
others to have children, and those who do give birth run an
increased risk of bearing a child with the same birth defect that
they themselves have. But most children born to women with birth
defects are healthy, and they face no increased risk of any type of
defect except their mother's.
</P>
<P>
   The study, being published Thursday in The New England Journal
of Medicine, was based on the birth certificates of 459,433 women
born in Norway from 1967 to 1982, including 8,192 with birth
defects. Dr. Allen Wilcox, an author of the report and chief of the
epidemiology branch at the National Institute of Environmental
Health Science, said it would be almost impossible to conduct a
study of this kind in the United States, where about 150,000 babies
are born with birth defects each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have the capacity to link a woman's birth records to
the birth of her children,'' Wilcox said. ``The system in Norway
offers a resource for epidemiologists that doesn't exist in most
places.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Donald Mattison, medical director for the March of Dimes, a
national birth defects foundation with headquarters in White
Plains, N.Y., said: ``It's a really good study. We're going to be
talking to our chapters about this. They end up working with
professionals who give counseling to families about their own risks
and those to their children.''
</P>
<P>
   The study, he said, provides information that was not available
before and could help people to estimate the risks of passing
specific birth defects along to their children. ``And it assures
them that they're not at greater risk for something other than what
they have,'' Mattison said.
</P>
<P>
   The March of Dimes estimates that there are 3,000 to 5,000
different birth defects, but the researchers conducting the new
study sorted their subjects' defects into 24 broader categories.
The more common ones included heart defects, cleft palate, cleft
lip, club foot and limb defects. Also counted were disorders of the
spine and nervous system and Down syndrome, which causes mental
retardation. The study included only defects that were obvious
enough when a child was born to have been noted on the birth
certificate.
</P>
<P>
   Because some of the conditions were severe, death rates during
infancy and childhood were higher in the girls born with defects.
Nearly 20 percent had died by the age of 15, as opposed to only 2
percent of those without birth defects.
</P>
<P>
   The survivors with birth defects were less likely than other
women to have children of their own. By the age of 30, only 53
percent had given birth, as compared with 67 percent of the women
without birth defects.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But the researchers did not know why fewer of the women had
children: they could not tell whether the women were less likely to
find partners, or chose not to become pregnant or were physically
unable to have children.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like to distinguish whether it's social or
physical,'' said the first author of the study, Dr. Rolv Skjaerven,
of the division of medical statistics at the University of Bergen
in Norway. ``But we haven't done that yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Other researchers speculate that some birth defects might have
an unrecognized link to infertility.
</P>
<P>
   Children of the women with birth defects did have a somewhat
increased risk of being born with the same defect as their mothers,
but the number actually affected was small. Of 1,613 children born
to 1,101 women, only 62, or 3.8 percent, had birth defects. Among
children born to the other women, 2.4 percent had birth defects,
meaning that the overall risk of any birth defect occurring in
children whose mothers had birth defects was only 1.6 times that of
children whose mothers did not.
</P>
<P>
   In 26 cases, mothers and children had the same birth defects.
They were cleft palate, cleft lip, clubfoot and limb defects, and
for those conditions, the children's risk ranged from 5 to 82 times
that of a child whose mother did not have that defect.
</P>
<P>
   Those findings were not surprising, researchers said, because it
has long been recognized that those disorders sometimes run in
families.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing that was striking to us is the fact that women with
birth defects contribute such a tiny amount to the burden of birth
defects in the next generation,'' Wilcox said. Their children
accounted for only 5 out of 1,000 birth defects in the next
generation, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Betty Mekdeci, director of the Association of Birth Defect
Children, in Orlando, Fla., said, ``The good news was that these
women did not have a huge incidence of recurrence of birth
defects.''
</P>
<P>
   The lower birth rates did not surprise Ms. Mekdeci. ``Let's face
it,'' she said. ``If you're born with a major birth defect, you've
gone through a lot in your life and may not want to put a child
through it.''

HOSPITAL SUES DOCTOR WHO WANTS TO LEAVE AND TAKE PATIENTS WITH
HIM

 By RANDY KENNEDY

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It happens all the time in the legal and financial
worlds: Lawyers or stockbrokers jump from one firm to another,
taking their clients _ and the clients' money _ with them.
</P>
<P>
   But what happens if the professional is a doctor?
</P>
<P>
   When Dr. Andrew Wiznia, a highly regarded pediatric AIDS
specialist at Bronx-Lebanon Hospital, announced in February that he
would move to another Bronx hospital, Jacobi Medical Center, and
that his patients and precious Medicaid and research-grant money
would follow, Bronx-Lebanon wasted no time. It sued him and two
colleagues, not only asking for millions of dollars in damages but
also seeking to bar the doctors from treating their patients
anywhere else for six months.
</P>
<P>
   Although legal maneuvering like that may be common in the
business world, Wiznia warned in court papers that such a
prohibition could have ``potentially life-threatening
consequences'' for the vulnerable patients he sees: about 180
children who are HIV positive, some with AIDS. They are not, he
adds, ``chattel belonging to any institution.''
</P>
<P>
   But the hospital has angrily contended in memos that ``the
patients in the pediatric AIDS center belong to the hospital'' and
has put the AIDS clinic's workers on notice that it is ``incorrect
for the staff giving patients `choices''' about where they can be
treated.
</P>
<P>
   Such high-stakes turf wars, once unheard of, are becoming more
common among hospitals around the country, health care experts say.
As managed care squeezes hospitals' budgets, hospitals are
increasingly trying to woo popular doctors, hoping they will bring
with them a rich pipeline of patients and coveted research grant
money.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the competition was mainly for doctors who treated
privately insured patients, but these days competition is fierce
even for those who care for patients covered by Medicaid, the
government-financed health insurance for the poor. Those patients
were once shunned because reimbursement for their care was so low,
but now are considered a reasonable source of income.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest battles are over a particularly coveted set of
Medicaid patients whose bills are richly reimbursed.
</P>
<P>
   This set of patients calls for many surgical specialties _
obstetrics and gynecology, neurology and orthopedic surgery. And in
New York, where Medicaid payment rates for HIV and AIDS treatment
are higher than in any other state, it includes patients like the
ones Wiznia and his colleagues have treated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consequence,'' said Mark Barnes, a New York health care
lawyer and former AIDS policy official with the city's Health
Department, ``is that there's acute competition among New York City
hospitals not only for AIDS patients, but for the physicians who
treat them.''
</P>
<P>
   Although jilted hospitals, in general, tend to make some kind of
fuss over departing doctors, often threatening legal action or,
alternately, offering incentives for the doctors to stay, health
care experts said this case was unusual because Bronx-Lebanon had
actually gone to court to block Wiznia's move. The lawsuit keeps
Wiznia and his two colleagues temporarily in place at
Bronx-Lebanon, after the sides agreed to a three-week ``cooling
off'' period, which ends Friday, when a judge is scheduled to hear
a request from the hospital to keep the doctors in place longer.
</P>
<P>
   The case has also raised complex ethical questions that doctors
and hospitals must now confront at the intersection of medicine and
big business, including questions about the rights of poor,
publicly insured patients vs. wealthier, privately insured ones.
</P>
<P>
   Would anyone, for example, try to prevent private patients from
following a doctor who switched hospitals, or describe them as
belonging to the first hospital?
</P>
<P>
   And is it unfair competition, or misuse of confidential patient
records, if a doctor tells his patients that he is leaving a
hospital and that he hopes they will follow? Or is he simply being
a conscientious doctor?
</P>
<P>
   Almost all of Wiznia's patients have indicated that they are
eager to follow him and his colleagues to their new home at Jacobi.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of income Bronx-Lebanon would suffer if those patients
left is compounded because Wiznia's move to Jacobi also threatens
to strip the hospital of another huge chunk of money, more than $1
million a year in research grants from the government and from drug
companies for Bronx-Lebanon's pediatric AIDS center, one of the
busiest in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Partly because New York state's overall share of research money
from the prestigious National Institutes of Health _ the largest
contributor to Bronx-Lebanon's pediatric AIDS program _ has
declined over the last decade, such grants are as good as gold to
both private hospitals, like Bronx-Lebanon, and public hospitals,
like Jacobi.
</P>
<P>
   They are particularly important sources of income to the
hospitals in this case, both of which serve a predominantly poor
population, with many uninsured patients and few opportunities for
major philanthropic donations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without any major grant funding, the center will likely lose
patients and staff, thereby placing its immediate future in serious
jeopardy,'' the hospital claimed as part of the suit.
</P>
<P>
   The National Institutes of Health has written to the hospital to
say that when a principal holder of a grant _ such as Wiznia _
switches hospitals, generally ``the grant has moved with that
individual.'' The NIH has also called Bronx-Lebanon, asking it to
release the grant. The hospital has refused, and it now appears the
grant will remain at Bronx-Lebanon at least while the hospital
applies to have it renewed under a new doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the doctors named in the suit nor officials at
Bronx-Lebanon returned calls seeking comment for this article. But
in court documents, which include almost two months of angry
letters between the hospital and the doctors who left,
Bronx-Lebanon officials accused Wiznia of essentially arranging a
coup to steal patients and most of the AIDS center's staff.

 NEW YORK: center's staff. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They say that on Feb. 16, the day he resigned _ citing
longstanding disagreements with the hospital over grant spending
and the hospital's commitment to the AIDS center _ Wiznia also
handed over resignation letters for 19 of the center's 28 staff
members.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital contends that Wiznia essentially misled the other
staff members, and induced them to follow him by telling them that
the AIDS program was to be transferred to a ``windowless basement''
and that he was about to be fired, which the hospital says is
untrue. Wiznia denied that he misled anyone, and accused the
hospital of failing to support the clinic by not hiring necessary
personnel and not paying bills promptly. He said hospital officials
had told him that the clinic would be moved out of its offices near
the Grand Concourse.
</P>
<P>
   He added in court papers that he was not leaving because he
would make more money at Jacobi, which, he pointed out, is part of
the ``financially strapped municipal hospital system.'' The
incentive, he said, was that Jacobi would commit the resources he
felt he needed to run his program.
</P>
<P>
   The same day that Wiznia and two colleagues, Dr. Joanna
Dobrosyzcki and Dr. Michael Rosenberg, resigned, they mailed
letters to parents of their patients, reminding them that they were
legally entitled to get treatment anywhere they wanted. ``It is our
sincerest hope,'' the letter said, ``that you have been happy with
us as your medical care provider and will choose to remain our
patient.''
</P>
<P>
   Wiznia contends that this was his moral and even legal
responsibility and, indeed, that of any doctor who moves. In his
case, his lawyers say, it was even more important because he has
treated some of the infected children continuously for as long as a
decade, has detailed knowledge of their drug regimens and medical
quirks, and has earned their trust.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can hardly be said that vying to care for sick children
with AIDS is analogous to stealing confidential information from an
insurance company or misappropriating cutting-edge computer
technology,'' wrote Wiznia's lawyers, referring to cases the
hospital's lawyers had cited to condemn the doctors' actions.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Ram Kairam, Bronx-Lebanon's director of pediatrics,
argues that it was exactly the hallowed doctor-patient relationship
that Wiznia and his colleagues abused. ``He confused the sanctity
of the doctor-patient relationship with the business of the
hospital,'' Kairam said. He added: ``What would IBM say if you
stole their clients and took them somewhere else?''
</P>
<P>
   Wiznia referred calls about this article to his lawyer, Richard
Nicholson. Nicholson said Wednesday that Kairam's comments betrayed
the hospital's hard focus on money.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kids to them are poker chips,'' he said. ``The sanctity
of the doctor-patient relationship outweighs the business of the
hospital in every situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Thomas, 55, the grandfather of a 7-year-old HIV-positive
patient, said he would not think twice about sending his grandson
to Jacobi, even though he serves as the chairman of Bronx-Lebanon's
AIDS Community Advisory Board and feels a responsibility to the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in a precarious position here where I'm trying to be
neutral, but I'm going to stay loyal to the people who saved my
grandson's life,'' said Thomas, who, like many of Wiznia's
patients, speaks of him in almost reverent tones. ``Maybe there are
faults on both sides. It's like in a marriage. But you've got to
recognize the work these people have done to save lives.''
</P>
<P>
   An official with one of the foster-care agencies that represents
dozens of the young patients _ about 40 percent of the hospital's
patients are in foster care _ said every foster parent associated
with that agency quickly decided to follow Wiznia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I deal with a lot of immunologists, and he's the best one I
know,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
``We didn't even have to go to the parents. We gave them the
option, but they had already made up their minds.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, most of the parents have already asked that their
children's medical records be transferred to Jacobi.
</P>
<P>
   But Bronx-Lebanon has let the parents know that it would love to
keep their business after Wiznia and his colleagues leave.
</P>
<P>
   The end of a March 8 letter to patients' parents was reminiscent
of an old-fashioned toaster offer from a bank: Kairam announced
that the chief executive of the hospital, Miguel Fuentes, had
authorized free parking and Metropasses for patients and their
parents, and taxis for those bringing in sick children. He promised
that the hospital would improve the elevators at the clinic and
would also start serving free lunches.
</P>
<P>
   As both sides become mired in the case, Wiznia has warned
ominously that the dispute has already begun to affect the
treatment of sick children. The National Institutes of Health has
halted enrollment of new children into their clinical drug trials
at Bronx-Lebanon because of the lawsuit, he said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Wiznia wrote, an 8-month-old baby with AIDS whose
parents consented on March 15 to enroll him in a clinical trial
``is now unable to obtain this essential treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   Kairam said in an interview that Wiznia could easily enroll the
child in a similar drug trial at another hospital, and was simply
using the story of the infant to vilify Bronx Lebanon. He added
that he blamed Wiznia for the enrollment being halted.

   ``This whole thing could have been done in a peaceable manner,''
he said of Wiznia's plans to move to Jacobi. Parents of the
children who are caught in the middle of the battle say they are
just ready for it to be over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that AIDS is a business,'' said Leonard Rabb, 43, an
HIV-positive man whose 10-year-old son is also infected and has
been treated by Wiznia and his colleagues for four years. ``It's
about dollars and cents. But Andy talks to my son not just as a
doctor _ as a kind of parent. When something isn't going to work,
he's honest about it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This thing,'' he said resolutely, ``needs to get settled.''

NURTURE YOUR OUTBOARD BEFORE TROUT OPENING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEREMY BAGOTT  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Meet Bob Brown, who has owned The Anchor, a marine
hardware and small-boat retailer in Reseda, since 1956. The man
knows outboard motors. His employees are convinced his heart beats
in two-stroke cycles and that a carbureted mixture of fuel and oil
flows through his veins.
</P>
<P>
   Brown is considered the Mark McGwire of Merc, the Michael Jordan
of Johnson, the Evander Holyfield of Evinrude.
</P>
<P>
   While he knows outboards, he also knows that maintenance of the
family motor ranks right up there with worming Fido, flushing the
hot-water heater and flossing: It's mostly put off until signs of
trouble arise.
</P>
<P>
   And as the days, hours and seconds tick down to Crowley Lake's 5
a.m. flare that kicks off the Eastern Sierra trout opener April 24,
Brown implores anglers to be good to that motor. Because for some
boaters who back their trailers down the ramps at roadside venues
like Crowley, Convict and June lakes, the day will be more bane
than blessing.
</P>
<P>
   The good news? There's more than two weeks left to inspect your
boat and trailer, lay in the right supplies and get the outboard
back in commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Californians don't decommission their boats at the end of the
season. That's more a `back East' thing,'' said Brown. ``It's
because there's no real offseason here.''
</P>
<P>
   But storing an engine properly over periods of inactivity, he
assures, is !ital!not!off! the exclusive domain of Upstate New
Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   Had you done things right, you might have carefully drained the
fuel from your outboard's tank. And mounted the engine in a trash
can filled with water, then let it run in neutral until it died of
fuel starvation and the float bowl emptied.
</P>
<P>
   You took an aerosol can of fogging oil _ available at any marine
store _ and sprayed the carburetor throat and pulled the starter
cord a few times. And you removed the plugs and sent a spritz of
oil into each cylinder and pulled the starter cord a few more times
to distribute it.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, you drained and refilled the lower-unit gear lubricant.
</P>
<P>
   You !ital!did!off! do all of that, right?
</P>
<P>
   If the answer is no, and your older two-stroke has been sitting
for three months or your four-popper for more than eight months,
there could be trouble afoot.
</P>
<P>
   More on that later, but listen to those who have made boating on
the first day of trout season a tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Fishing buddies Ron Herschberger of Mar Vista and Mas Nobunaga
of West Los Angeles have done the opener for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Nobunaga, who takes his 21-foot Boston Whaler up Highway 395
every year, is big on safety, while Herschberger, whose most recent
boat was a wood-and-glass outboard with a Johnson 35, is the
Johnny-on-the-spot parts guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``My advice,'' said Herschberger, ``is to take extra shear pins
for the prop (shear pins hold the propeller in place and are
designed to shear off in the event it hits an obstruction) and
extra spark plugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Half the people up there have fouled plugs because their
carburetors aren't adjusted for high altitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobunaga focuses on issues of caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``June Lake can be dangerous if it's windy,'' he said. ``It can
be just as bad as the ocean. Stay close to shore in boats with
smaller motors. Also have life jackets, a fire extinguisher and at
least one oar, preferably two,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Now back to the specifics on what happens if you didn't properly
prep your engine for storage, and how to rectify problems that may
have developed.
</P>
<P>
   The fuel in your carburetor float bowl may have gone bad and the
carb jets could be gunked up. If you suspect this has happened,
it's best to have it checked out, said Brown, who also recommends
spending the money to replace the in-line fuel filter and
water-fuel separator.
</P>
<P>
   Here is Brown's short lecture on plugs if they haven't been
replaced in a year: Get new ones.
</P>
<P>
   If the old plugs come out oil-fouled, pitted, carbon-fouled or
otherwise look like a caddis fly hatch occurred on the electrodes,
consult a professional.
</P>
<P>
   Brown recommends attending to the grease fittings and
aggressively cleaning the motor.
</P>
<P>
   Refer to the owner's manual for the lube points and how often
they should be tended to, as well as for recommendations on
changing the lower-unit oil.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these engines are 20 and 30 years old, and the
lower-unit oil is critical,'' Brown said. ``Make sure the lubricant
is clean when you take it out. If it's not, you have to find out if
water is getting in and where it's coming from.''
</P>
<P>
   On the outboard's water pump, Brown is a stickler: ``Replace it
every year for saltwater use, every two years for freshwater.''
Most engine manufacturers agree.
</P>
<P>
   After the engine has been checked and you've pulled your boat to
the Eastern Sierra, keep in mind that some of the lakes have speed
limits. All the lakes along the June Lake Loop have a 10-mph speed
limit, except Grant Lake. Upper Twin Lake out of Bridgeport has no
speed limit, while at neighboring Lower Twin it's 5 mph. Check with
the marina at the lake in question. Most have ramp fees. As far as
boat-size restrictions, ``If you can get it into the lake,'' said
Ken Blaisdell of June Lake's Big Rock Landing, ``you can run it.''

FOR BOATS, IT'S HAUL FOR THE BEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEREMY BAGOTT  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The boat trailer leads a hard life.
</P>
<P>
   In proportion to the strength of its frame, it has to bear a
greater load than the vehicle towing it. And it's immersed in
saltwater or freshwater each time the boat is launched and
recovered.
</P>
<P>
   As the April 24 Eastern Sierra trout opener nears, boaters
should ask some hard questions of themselves, say the experts:
</P>
<P>
   _Were concrete blocks placed under the trailer's frame to take
the load off the tires and axle during storage?
</P>
<P>
   _Have all rust spots been sanded, primed and painted?
</P>
<P>
   _When were the wheel bearings last repacked and the break
linings checked?
</P>
<P>
   Whatever you have or haven't done, you'll need to thoroughly
inspect the trailer before hitching it up.
</P>
<P>
   Every good inspection starts with the shake, rattle and roll
test, which has absolutely no link to the Big Joe Turner song. It's
simply grabbing the frame and shaking the boat and trailer
strenuously a number of times, then checking all rattles for loose
hardware and breakage. The trailer should be off its blocks when
you do this.
</P>
<P>
   Follow the shake test with a careful visual examination. It is
now a good time to make sure the weight of the boat is dispersed
evenly over all rollers. If one roller isn't making contact with
the hull, loosen its bolt, push it up against the boat, then
retighten it.
</P>
<P>
   Next, check the hitch cup and ball contact. The hitch cup and
ball are at the heart of the towing operation and deserve a good
once-over. If all looks right, stick a sliver of soap between the
hitch cup and ball before hooking up the trailer; this acts as a
lubricant.
</P>
<P>
   Next, test the trailer lights and turn signals, then check the
tires for dry rot, bald spots and flat spots. Inflate the tires to
the recommended tire pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Apply waterproof grease to the winch bearings, gears and lock,
the keel roller assembly, the bracket pivots and any other moving
parts you can find.
</P>
<P>
   Repack the wheel bearings, or have them repacked professionally,
and retorque the wheel lug nuts.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, check the safety chain; replace it if it has been
dragging anywhere along its length.
</P>
<P>
   Remember to follow manufacturers' guidelines on all of the
above, first and foremost.
</P>
<P>
   Good fishing at the opener, and don't forget to remove the
cement blocks before pulling out of the driveway.

CLINTON SAYS HE WON'T CHANGE POLICY ON OPEN RELATIONS WITH CHINA &HT;    
 &HT;   
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    By JENNIFER DAY 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On the eve of meeting Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji,
President Clinton said his policy to maintain open relations with
China would not change, despite recent events that have highlighted
fault lines in U.S.-Sino relations.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu, on a nine-day U.S. tour, arrived Wednesday in Washington
where recent reports have outlined espionage, illegal campaign
contributions from Chinese military intelligence officials, and
human rights abuses. Tensions also have been exacerbated by Chinese
objections to NATO airstrikes on Yugoslavia and a U.S.-sponsored
United Nations resolution condemning human rights abuses in China.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers have criticized Clinton's approach toward China,
believing the president is wrongly putting economic growth before
human rights and military concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not change our policy in a way that isolates China
from the global forces that have begun to empower the Chinese
people to change their society and build a better future, for that
would leave the people of China with less access to information,
less contact with the democratic world and more resistance from
their government to outside influence and ideas,'' Clinton said
Wednesday at the U.S. Institute for Peace.
</P>
<P>
   As part of that policy, the Clinton administration negotiated a
civil aviation agreement expected to be signed today that would
greatly expand air service between the two countries over the next
two years, White House officials revealed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, three U.S. carriers _ United Airlines, Northwest
Airlines and Federal Express _ are permitted to provide a total of
27 flights weekly to three Chinese cities, Beijing, Shanghai and
Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
   China's three international carriers currently can operate 27
flights to 10 U.S. cities, while funneling passengers to an
additional 10 American locations through ``code-sharing''
arrangements with U.S. carriers.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement will double the number of weekly flights from each
country to 54 by April 1, 2001. A fourth American carrier will be
permitted to fly to China, and U.S. airlines will be allowed to fly
to two more cities.
</P>
<P>
   The next year, U.S. carriers may sign code-sharing arrangements
with Chinese carriers to route passengers to another 10 Chinese
cities.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese carriers will gain rights to fly to two additional
U.S. cities and sign code-sharing agreements for another 30
American destinations.
</P>
<P>
   The aviation agreement comes as negotiators are still trying to
work out a deal to allow China to join the World Trade
Organization, which enforces international trade rules.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton stressed in his speech that Chinese membership in the
trade organization is in the United States' interest because it
would open Chinese markets to American businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is this: If China is willing to play by the
global rules of trade, it would be an inexplicable mistake for the
United States to say no,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL ADD END)
</P>
<P>
   Some legislators doubt whether China's admission to the trade
organization is in U.S. interests.
</P>
<P>
   Majority leadership members from both the Senate and House, Sen.
Trent Lott, R-Miss., and Rep. Dick Armey, R-Irving, said they found
it difficult to support Chinese membership in the World Trade
Organization. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jesse
Helms, R-N.C., and Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., a ranking Democrat
on the Senate Commerce Committee, announced they would present
legislation requiring congressional approval for any deal allowing
China to join the trade organization.
</P>
<P>
   Two California representatives, Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, and
Christopher Cox, a Republican, held a joint news conference to push
Clinton to discuss human rights and allegations that China stole
U.S. nuclear secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Cox questioned whether the United States should trust China,
considering that it signed onto a human rights covenant, but
continued to crack down on democratic activists.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's the track record, why should we believe that the
(People's Republic of China) will keep its promises for the
future?'' asked Cox, who headed a panel that investigated whether
sensitive military technologies were transferred to China.

A PRACTICAL GUIDE TO THE PROFESSIONAL GUIDE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DICK FAY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ ``Montana? Sounds great, but forget hiring a
fishing guide.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure I would join my buddies drifting and fly-fishing the
Yellowstone and Madison rivers. But who needs another ``disasta in
Alaska'' experience with a guide?
</P>
<P>
   The memory of having flown a couple of thousand miles, hiring
the local angling guru and coming home with nothing was fresh. The
only thing caught was a bad attitude from our beer-sloshing,
know-it-all ``guide.'' The only bite was out of my checkbook.
</P>
<P>
   My friends reacted in their typically sensitive fashion: ``We'll
go without you, but not without a guide. We haven't got a clue
about Montana fishing, the rivers, the weather, what the trout are
feeding on, how to drift-fish _ nothing. So, the question is, how
do we find a really good guide?''
</P>
<P>
   Good question. Obviously, the system we used for the Alaska trip
_ 1.open phone book, 2.close eyes, 3.point finger _ didn't work too
well.
</P>
<P>
   It was time for another tactic _ actually asking for
suggestions. Anyone who might help _ the Bozeman Chamber of
Commerce, the local newspaper, outfitters and motel owners _ was
contacted.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it was the legwork or dumb luck, we had the fly-fishing
trip of a lifetime. We caught wild rainbow, cutthroat and German
brown trout to 20 inches on light rigs in a veritable rip of a
river. Location, weather and cooperative trout contributed, but the
real credit belonged to our guides.
</P>
<P>
   The lessons learned in finding qualified guides may help others
searching for an indelible fishing memory, including those anglers
planning to travel for the Eastern Sierra trout opener. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Who to call? &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
The answer is anyone who has had  &UR; !ital! &LR; first-hand
experience &UR; !off! &LR;  with a good guide or outfitter. Try the fly
shops, outfitters, fishing lodges and the regional guide and
outfitter associations, if any are available. The local chamber of
commerce, tourist bureau and motel and hotels can offer
recommendations. Some travel agents specialize in fishing trips.
Check the Internet and library sources for fishing articles that
identify guides by name.
</P>
<P>
   In California, fishing and hunting guides are licensed by the
Department of Fish and Game. Recreationists can request a free list
of guides by calling the DFG's License and Revenue Branch at (916)
227-2271 or writing to the branch at: 3211 S St., Sacramento, CA
95816. Or visit the DFG's Web site, www.dfg.ca.gov, and click to
``licensing,'' then ``list of licensed guides,'' for the same list.
(See accompanying story for a list of related agencies in other
Western states.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
For your protection &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Be sure to employ a licensed guide or outfitter; call the DFG to
confirm a guide is licensed.
</P>
<P>
   Northern California outfitter and guide Herb Burton is blunt
about people who claim to be great guides but won't pay the fees or
take out the performance bond that goes with a license.
</P>
<P>
   ``Licensing separates the pirates from the pros,'' Burton said.
``Why would you trust someone who won't even post a $1,000
performance bond, let alone insurance?''
</P>
<P>
   Richard L. Elliott, the DFG's chief of conservation, education
and enforcement, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most licensed guides really know what they are doing and give
their best shot to help customers. They also protect clients, by
knowing fishing regulations for each part of a river, for
instance,'' Elliott said. ``If clients get a citation for violating
a regulation, the guides can lose their licenses and their
businesses.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Before calling &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Don't touch the phone before deciding when and where you're going.
Research and identify the region and be ready to specify dates of
travel and exact fishing dates for booking a guide.
</P>
<P>
   In the high country, rivers run clearer and days are hotter in
summer; when fall colors come out, so do more dry-fly fishers.
Winter fishing brings on salmon and steelhead around the West.
Spring fly-fishing can be good in tail-water riffles, Alpine lakes,
spring creeks and anywhere there's a caddis hatch. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Have clear goals &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Dave Corcoran, co-owner of the River's Edge Outfitters in Bozeman,
Mont., suggests prospective guides describe their perfect day.
</P>
<P>
   ``That defines whether they expect a scenic adventure, intense
fishing, leisurely river float or fish-walk-and-wade,'' he said.
Determine whether you are after lots of fish _ with no guarantees,
of course _ or desire to catch only a few and learn more about
technique.
</P>
<P>
   Also, do you wish to fish dry-flies, nymphs or streamer
patterns, on rivers, spring creeks, lakes or ponds?

   ``But be flexible,'' Corcoran suggested. ``We don't control
weather, water or fishing conditions.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Hands-on help or ``Just row?'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Liz Lewis, a fishing guide with R. J. Cain &AMP; Co. of Bozeman, Mont.,
asks clients to clarify up front how much help they'll need.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let us know if you want no instruction, some instruction and
coaching or a lot of teaching and direction,'' Lewis said. ``And
remember to specify if you want a man or woman guide.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Who's going and what's needed? &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
You'll be asked how many will be in the party. Make a list by name,
gender, age, level of experience, physical limitations and
equipment requirements. Some guides provide all fishing gear;
others expect you to bring the gear or rent it from them or their
outfitter.
</P>
<P>
   Save yourself a phone call by having necessary information at
hand, such as waist and shoe sizes for wader rentals. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
When calling &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Direct, honest communication are keys to a positive outing. As you
give and take facts, check out each guide's compatibility and
competence. Evaluate them for friendliness, flexibility, enthusiasm
and professionalism. Note license number(s) and years of
experience. Ask the guide to describe an ideal trip. Request
guiding fees, inclusions, exclusions and deposits; most fly-fishing
packages are by day rate and a reservation deposit of one day's fee
is requested. Find out if fishing gear, flies, transportation to
the site and lunch are included, as well as what you must supply,
buy or rent. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
What else to ask &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Weather: What is the forecast and its impact on fishing?
</P>
<P>
   Clothes: What to wear during the excursion?
</P>
<P>
   Time and place: How long is the typical fishing day? When and
where are you to meet on the first day?
</P>
<P>
   References: Request phone numbers of clients who have been
guided within the past year.
</P>
<P>
   Accommodations: Outfitters and guides frequently can recommend
places to stay, often in several price ranges. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;

 A Faster Way to Surf the Web
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Deborah Solomon &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
You may have seen them while tooling around the Bay Area: ads on
billboards and buses that promise speedy Internet connections at an
affordable price.
</P>
<P>
   Called a digital subscriber line, or DSL, the new technology
lets home users access the Internet at speeds up to 50 times faster
than a traditional modem at a cost only two or three times that of
regular Internet service.
</P>
<P>
   The technology, which uses the same copper wires that provide
telephone service, lets users talk on the phone and surf the Web
simultaneously, without adding a second line. It also provides an
``always-on'' connection, meaning users don't have to dial their
Internet service provider each time they want to check out a Web
site.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, DSL service cost &UR;  &LR; more than $90 a month.
</P>
<P>
   But in January, prices started to tumble after Pac Bell lowered
its price on DSL service from $89 per month to $39 for unlimited
use. Customers still must pay for Internet service, which generally
costs another $10 to $20 per month.
</P>
<P>
   Pac Bell also charges a one-time fee of $198, which pays for
installation, a DSL modem and a hardware card that's installed in
the computer.
</P>
<P>
   America Online plans to offer DSL service through Pacific Bell
to Californians by the end of the year for about $20 (on top of
AOL's $20 monthly service charge). Other companies, such as Covad
Communications, Concentric Networks and Northpoint Communications,
are selling DSL to ISPs, which offer the service to small- and
medium-size businesses.
</P>
<P>
   But not everybody can get DSL, and the technology is not without
flaws. Industry watchers say DSL may not be the right solution for
every Internet user.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, DSL looks great and it's very exciting, but ... how
good it's going to be in the home market is yet to be proven,''
said Nancy Kaplan, who follows the high-speed data market for
Renaissance Worldwide, a consulting firm in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; It Has Problems
</P>
<P>
   ``You still end up with technical glitches and it's still very
new ..it definitely does have some problems.''
</P>
<P>
   DSL signals, which carry digital data, travel over the copper
phone wires that run between a customer's home to a Pac Bell
central switching office. Phone calls travel over the wire at a
very low frequency. DSL signals travel at a higher frequency over
the same wire and do not interfere with phone calls. That's why
users can talk on the phone and surf the Web simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   DSL is just one of several technologies competing to speed up
the Internet. Its closest competitor is the cable modem, which is
faster than DSL and costs about the same, but is not widely
available.
</P>
<P>
   DSL isn't available everywhere either. To get DSL, a user must
be within three miles of Pac Bell's central switching office.
That's because the farther the DSL signal travels, the more it
degrades. This limitation applies to all DSL service, because all
DSL providers in the Bay Area place their equipment at Pac Bell
central switching offices.
</P>
<P>
   While customers who live one mile from a central switching
office may get super-fast service, those who live 2.9 miles from
the office will have slower connections. Even at a distance of
three miles, Pac Bell guarantees speeds of 384 kilobits per second,
which is still seven times faster than the fastest dial-up modem.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone outside the three-mile radius is out of luck, at least
for now. Companies are working on ways to extend DSL's reach.
</P>
<P>
   Expanding Service
</P>
<P>
   By year's end, Pac Bell plans to have 262 central offices
equipped for DSL. At that point, about half of Pac Bell's customers
in California should be able to get DSL.
</P>
<P>
   Since announcing the price drop, Pac Bell has been overwhelmed
by customers who want DSL service. The company has gotten about
three times as many calls as it expected and has had trouble
accommodating the demand, officials said. Some customers say
they've waited two weeks to get service, but Pac Bell says the
maximum wait is seven days and that it is hiring more technicians
to keep up with demand.
</P>
<P>
   Once they've been hooked up, some customers have complained
about not being able to access the Internet. Others said they were
promised service and then told, on the day of installation, that
the service could not be installed because of in-home wiring
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Dimmitt, vice president of consumer marketing at Pac Bell,
said he expects that the company eventually will have 2 million DSL
customers, but declined to say how many it has now.
</P>
<P>
   Not for Big Business
</P>
<P>
   Industry experts say the DSL service is the answer for
telecommuters, most home offices and people who do a lot of Web
surfing. But they're not the answer for bigger companies or anyone
who can't tolerate temporary slowdowns.
</P>
<P>
   DSL, like cable modem and dial-up modems, suffers from
``bottleneck'' problems when thousands of users try to use the
service at once, said Greg Howard, principal analyst with the
High-Tech Resources Consulting Group in San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   Two other high-speed alternatives _ T1 and ISDN service _ do not
have as many bottleneck problems because there is one line for each
customer, although that customer may have many users. However, ISDN
is about three times slower than DSL.
</P>
<P>
   ``I subscribe to DSL at my home office and performance-wise, as
a home user, it is perfectly acceptable,'' Howard said. ``However,
as time goes on and more subscribers are added, I have to wonder
how my performance will be affected.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard said companies are working on ways to avoid bottlenecks,
but those solutions may be months away.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan agrees that DSL isn't for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The appeal of DSL is small- and medium-size businesses and
users who don't go to the Internet enough to justify the expense of
a T1 line,'' Kaplan said. ``It's unlikely that DSL is going to be
universal. It's more of an interim service that people will take
advantage of.''

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The guide doesn't control all of a fishing
trip's outcome; the client contributes greatly. Tips to ensure
things go as smoothly as possible:
</P>
<P>
   Be responsible: Meet on time; have your license, gear and
supplies ready to go.
</P>
<P>
   Be flexible: Conditions may require a change in plans, taking
you to different places than you intended.
</P>
<P>
   Expect no guarantees: No one promises big fish, or any fish, for
that matter. Be ready to catch and release where appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   Listen carefully: Hear and follow what the guide suggests,
especially in an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Drop the ego: Women usually learn faster, guides note, because
they don't have an ill-placed ``king of the river'' self-image
standing in their way as often as men do.
</P>
<P>
   Respect the guide: Treat the guide courteously and use any
equipment you borrow with care.
</P>
<P>
   Expect professionalism: You deserve what you pay for... or you
have a right to complain.
</P>
<P>
   Lighten up: Have fun. &QL;

 No Avoiding Dreaded Spam
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By David Einstein &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  Help! I am being inundated with unwanted e-mail. I'm a
computer novice and don't know what to do about this problem.
Should I change my ISP, my e-mail address, or is there some
security feature on my computer that can help?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  Welcome to the club. Almost everybody who uses e-mail
knows what it's like to log on and find your in-box stuffed full of
junk mail. Also called spam, these nuisance messages usually take
the form of advertisements for sleazy products, get-rich-quick
schemes or online pornography sites _ all pretty yucky stuff. By
some estimates, spam now accounts for more than one-quarter of all
e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Spam, like regular junk mail, is sent to thousands of people at
the same time, using mailing lists. Spammers get addresses in a
number of ways, often buying them outright from ISPs or marketing
firms.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, there's not a lot you can do to stop spam, and
changing your ISP or your e-mail address will bring only a brief
respite until spammers discover you again.
</P>
<P>
   There also is no truly effective spam-filtering software for
your PC. America Online lets you block messages from specific users
and Internet domains (the name to the right of the  &LR;  sign in an
e-mail address). But because AOL users get more spam than just
about anyone, that's not much comfort.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, says Paul Hoffman, director of the Internet Mail
Consortium in Santa Cruz, ``you just have to learn to live with
it.'' He holds out hope, however, that new anti-spam technology
might bring relief in the near future. One San Francisco company,
Bright Light Technologies, already is selling a sophisticated
spam-filtering system to ISPs and is developing one for home users.
</P>
<P>
   My advice is to call your ISP and suggest that they get the
Bright Light system or one like it. In the meantime, you have my
sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   Backup System
</P>
<P>
   Q: My old Windows 3.1 backup software doesn't work with Windows
95, and there aren't any upgrades available for it. I was
considering a Zip drive, but someone suggested using recordable
CD-ROMs instead. The discs are less expensive than Zip cartridges,
and they hold much more data. Also, the data can be transferred to
any computer that has a CD-ROM drive. Is this a reasonable
direction to go for backups?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: Seems to me you've answered your own question. CD-Rs, as
recordable CD-ROMs are known, provide excellent backup storage. A
CD holds up to 660 megabytes of data, compared with 100 megabytes
for a standard Zip cartridge. Plus, as you say, you can use them in
almost any PC, without the need for a Zip drive.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, to create CD-Rs, you'll need a CD-R drive. That's
because regular CD-ROM drives can only read information off of
discs, not put data on them.
</P>
<P>
   But prices on CD-R drives are dropping fast. A basic model can
be had for under $200, though faster models can cost nearly twice
that much.
</P>
<P>
   Switching WebTV Service
</P>
<P>
   Q: We recently got a WebTV and are enjoying it a lot. My
question is: Can we use a different Internet provider? We pay
$24.95 a month for WebTV's service, but I hear others advertised
for less.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: WebTV would like you to use its Internet service, but the
company understands that some folks won't have a local dial-up
number for WebTV in their area, while others may want to use the
same ISP they have for their home computers. And still others, like
you, are determined to get the best possible deal on Internet
access.
</P>
<P>
   So, yes, you can use any ISP with WebTV. Check out the WebTV Web
site at  &LR; www.webtv.com &LR;  for details of their OpenISP policy.
</P>
<P>
   PC Turn On
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am a new stay-at-home mother and am able to get on the
computer to access the Internet two or three times a day for short
periods. Which is better for the computer, to leave it on for eight
hours or turn it off after each use?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: Leave the computer on (but not the Internet connection).
It won't hurt your system, and you'll save the time it takes to
boot up each time you want to use it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_  &UR; E-MAIL UPDATE: &LR;  In response to a question last week about using
e-mail at work for personal messages, I noted that bosses usually
can spy on employees' mail if they want. There is a way around
that, however. If you have access to the Internet at work, set up a
Web-based mail account with Hotmail or one of the big search
engines like Yahoo or Excite. That way, your mail will never go
through your company's e-mail system.
</P>
<P>

CHINESE PREMIER'S US TOUR COMES AMID GROWING TENSIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES A. RADIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With anti-China criticism rising in Congress and resentment of
America spreading in China, Premier Zhu Rongji's current tour of
the United States could become the most important visit here by a
Chinese leader since Deng Xiaoping donned a 10-gallon hat at a
Texas rodeo in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   US-China relations have seesawed wildly in the intervening two
decades, from unbridled optimism through most of the 1980s to
hostility and confrontation for most of the 1990s. Human rights,
trade, and the balance of military power in East Asia all are areas
of friction not likely to be resolved any time soon. President
Clinton is a short-timer beset by critics.
</P>
<P>
   And so the Chinese have sent the most personable and pragmatic
of their top leaders to try to calm the roiling waters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This visit is very important because the atmospherics are so
bad and the relationship is spiraling downward,'' says Thomas
Christenson, a specialist on US-China relations at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where Zhu will speak next
Wednesday after stops in Washington, Denver, Chicago, and New York.
``When things are going well, summits are window dressing. When
things are really bad, that's when visits like this are most
important.''
</P>
<P>
   Zhu gave indications of what Americans could expect from him
even before he left Beijing, when a proliferation of accusations
that China was backsliding on its human rights commitments and
stealing US nuclear secrets led to speculation he would cancel the
trip.
</P>
<P>
   Despite predictions that ``my forthcoming visit is unlikely to
be successful,'' he added at a rare press conference: ``I will go
anyway to lend (Americans) a chance to vent their anger or
complaints.''
</P>
<P>
   William Alford, director of East Asia legal studies at Harvard
Law School, says this ``confirms what we heard about Zhu _ that he
is fearless, and smart enough to understand what this is about. The
major purpose of this trip may be the patching up, healing, playing
to the US audience.''
</P>
<P>
   The contrast between Zhu and Chinese President Jiang Zemin is
stark. Confronted by pro-Tibet demonstrators in Bern last month,
Jiang questioned Swiss officials' ability to run their country, and
told them they had lost a friend.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, when Jiang, the last Chinese leader to visit the
United States, appeared at Harvard in 1997, questions that he would
be asked from the audience had to be submitted and screened in
advance. Zhu's representatives told MIT officials the premier
wanted the questions following his speech to be completely open.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts note that the modern history of US-China relations
has been a cycle of over-enthusiastic warmings and disillusioned
chills, and that this has been particularly true in the Clinton
Administration. The president picked a fight even before his
election, vowing to use trade as a weapon to make China respect
human rights, then backed down when China refused to yield.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Clinton Administration has really exacerbated'' the
extreme swings in American attitudes toward China ``by mishandling
China policy for so long,'' Alford said. ``Clinton really oversold
how rosy things were (on his trip to China) last summer, for
domestic political reasons, and it was a disservice to public which
has come back to haunt us.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he had not oversold, and stayed closer to the underlying
reality,'' Alford said, ``the relationship would be less vulnerable
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton himself said, in a speech in Washington Wednesday, that
Chinese and Americans often holds extreme, inaccurate ideas of each
other's motives and policies, and argued that ``we have to follow a
different course.''
</P>
<P>
   But just as the Chinese had reason to help Clinton make his trip
last summer be seen as a success in the United States, whether it
actually was or not, the US now has an interest in having Zhu's
trip play as a success in China: The premier is seen as highly
intelligent, open to Western economic ways, and above the
corruption plaguing much of Chinese officialdom.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is tough, efficient, has a sense of humor, and is
self-deprecating,'' says Merle Goldman, a Boston University
professor who specializes in Chinese intellectual history. ``Of all
the Chinese leaders, he is the one with character traits which most
appeal to Americans. He is the best emissary they could send.''
</P>
<P>
   China specialists stress that the US-China relationship is bound
to be fraught with difficulties, given the enormous differences in
the two countries' histories, economies, and political systems.
But, they add, there are also common needs _ particularly for
market access and for political stability in northeast Asia _ which
provide strong incentives to both sides to do repair work when
relations fray too badly.
</P>
<P>
   Ezra Vogel, director of Harvard's Fairbank Center for East Asian
Research, suggests that the decision to persevere with the visit
despite the deepening problems ``reflects a decision in China that
even though relations will be on a bumpy road through the next (US
presidential election) it is important to keep them on track
nevertheless.''
</P>
<P>
   It is usual for the party out of the White House to criticize
the China policy of the sitting president, Vogel said, then to
learn to deal with China when it regains the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Chinese understand they are in for a tempest over
the next 15 months,'' Vogel said, ``and then things will get down
to business.''

COMMENTARY: MEANWHILE, IN ISRAEL ... 
</HEADLINE>
  (kd) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Bring an end to the expulsions and the killing in Kosovo,''
says Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel, which has a field
hospital in operation near the Macedonian border.
</P>
<P>
   ``The suffering of innocent people is unacceptable and must be
stopped immediately,'' the imposing ex-general adds, ``or even
earlier. All the people must be able to return in safety under full
autonomy, with the Serbian army out.''
</P>
<P>
   He lays great emphasis on this, monitoring my writing-down of
``immediately'' and ``autonomy,'' because of an additional concern:
``From a global view, I don't think the best solution is to change
the boundaries of Yugoslavia.'' The candid Sharon worries that a
``greater Albania'' might attract an assortment of Bin Ladenites,
Chechens and Hezbollah to complicate the control of terror in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   That may turn out to be a farsighted assessment, but it seems to
me that the separation from Serbia of most of Kosovo is fit
punishment for Slobodan Milosevic's war criminality and a just
reparation for the uprooted and bloodied Kosovars.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, running for re-election,
wants no part of that independence controversy. He says, ``The
Israeli government should not meddle in the future arrangements of
Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Like hawkish doves and dovish hawks in America, Israelis are
afflicted with cognitive dissonance about the Balkan war. Many
remember help given Jews in World War II by anti-Nazi Serbs, and do
not identify with Muslim Kosovo Liberation Army leaders; this is
overwhelmed by their loathing of the way innocents are being loaded
into boxcars, evoking remembrance of sealed trains to Auschwitz.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon, in New York Thursday, will go to Washington to confer
with Madeleine Albright, who will be focused mainly on the visit of
China's premier, Zhu Rongji.
</P>
<P>
   That's timely; one of the questions sure to be asked of Sharon
has to do with charges of the transfer of American technology. So I
put it to him: Have you guys been passing our secrets to China and
Russia?
</P>
<P>
   ``I can say without doubt,'' says the foreign minister, ``that
there is no Israeli government policy to transfer any know-how
about sophisticated U.S. technology to any third country.''
</P>
<P>
   C'mon, Arik, that sounds a little artful.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we find any Israeli individuals doing any leakage,'' he
amplified, ``we'll cut it off right away. In fact, we heard of an
Israeli satellite-launching expert, working with an American
company, who may be trying to do some business in Russia. We need
specifics, but if it's true, we'll stop it. We'll fully cooperate
with the U.S. on this.''
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow last month, Netanyahu and Sharon made clear to Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov their concern about leakage of technology
to Iran and Iraq _ ``it's a danger to Israel, to Russia, to
Europe'' _ and supported U.S. pressure on Russian institutes
helping Iran's nuclear and missile work.
</P>
<P>
   But it's clear that Arik has a fondness for Russian culture:
``my mother, working barefoot in the fields, recited Pushkin by
heart.'' He sees the Russians re-entering Middle East politics, and
wants to break the pattern of their usual 100 percent support of
the Arab side. (He's working with his Russian counterpart in a
long-shot try to spring Serbia's U.S. prisoners.) And he wants a
million more Russian Jews to immigrate to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Now we're into politics. ``The key to next month's election is
the Russian Israelis,'' goes his analysis. They want better
Russian-Israeli relations, a free economy and a strong stand
against Arab claims. ``Two-thirds of the Russian Israelis are for
Bibi now. If I can get that up over 70 percent, that's it.''
</P>
<P>
   His polls show Bibi's Likud with 38 percent, Labor's Ehud Barak
at 35 percent, the third-party candidate Yitzhak Mordechai 12
percent, right-winger Benny Begin 5, and 10 percent undecided. In
the runoff, Sharon thinks two-thirds of the Mordechai vote will go
to Barak and almost all the Begin vote will go to Bibi, with the
undecided splitting evenly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't look too good a few weeks ago,'' he concludes, ``but
now there is a fair chance we'll win. It is _ what is your
expression? _ neck by neck!''
</P>
<P>
   Whoever's neck wins, Sharon is certain, a unity government will
be formed to deal with Yasser Arafat.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Hans-Joachim Becker thought he had endured
the worst, until a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
   As a managing director at Barmag AG, a manufacturer of textile
machinery near Duesseldorf, Becker pushed his company through a
brutal restructuring that eliminated 2,000 out of 5,000 jobs in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed to work brilliantly. Sales bounced back to a nearly
record level of 1.1 billion marks last year and profit soared 49
percent, to 75 million marks.
</P>
<P>
   But now his market has collapsed because of financial crises in
Asia and Latin America. Orders for new machines have plunged 44
percent, and Becker predicts that sales this year will drop to 630
million marks, currently $347 million, from 1.1 billion marks, or
$606 million. Two hundred people were laid off last month and
another 200 may have to go before the year is over.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is absolutely no investment in this business,'' Becker
said Wednesday. ``We have millions if not hundreds of millions of
consumers who are not able to afford a new shirt.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Barmag's case is extreme, it is not unique and goes to
the heart of the challenge that confronts the European Central Bank
when it decides on Thursday whether or not to lower interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts believe that the new central bank, which has until
recently dismissed a need for rate cuts, has become sufficiently
alarmed about Europe's economic growth prospects and is about to
reverse course. The same is true for the Bank of England, which has
already cut interest rates several times in the last few months.
</P>
<P>
   A lot is at stake. As guardian of a new single currency, the
European Central Bank is worried about establishing its credibility
with financial markets. It must also deal with contradictory
trends: growth is stagnant in Germany but still strong in Spain,
Portugal and Ireland; business confidence is low in many countries,
but consumers are more optimistic than they have been in years.
</P>
<P>
   The bigger question is whether a moderate cut in interest rates
will make all that much of an improvement. Europe's biggest
problems stem from the decline in exports to Asia, Russia and Latin
America, where many countries are still in deep recession, and
those problems have very little to do with European interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We already have an expansionary monetary policy,'' said Petra
Koehler, a senior economist at Dresdner Bank here . ``Monetary
policy is not what is burdening the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, interest rates in the 11 euro-zone countries have been
at 3 percent since the individual central banks, acting in
coordinated fashion, lowered rates from 3.3 percent last December.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Europeans have cut rates less than the Federal
Reserve in the United States, the benchmark short-term rate is
still well below the American federal funds rate of 4.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Economists widely expect the Bank of England to cut its
benchmark rate by one-quarter of a percentage point, to 5.25
percent. Those who think that the European Central Bank will reduce
rates do not expect more than a quarter-point cut, which would put
the rate at 2.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Germany's economic troubles have been aggravated because exports
of machinery and equipment were its major source of growth. Like
Barmag, which makes machines that produce and weave synthetic
fibers, scores of German engineering companies put themselves
through wrenching cost-reduction programs earlier this decade.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1991 and 1997, German engineering companies cut their
combined work forces by more than one-third, to 925,000 from 1.49
million. But they also became shrewder about marketing and design,
and persuaded unions to be more flexible about overtime or weekend
work.
</P>
<P>
   Those strategies bore fruit over the last two years. Aided by a
decline in the value of the German mark, which made products
cheaper in other markets, German exports enjoyed double-digit
growth until Asian financial crises deepened early in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The problems have now sunk into many of Germany's and Europe's
biggest industries. The German chemical industry, led by companies
like BASF and Hoechst, saw exports decline by 9.5 percent in the
last quarter of 1998 and are only limping along, with selling
prices under intense downward pressure.
</P>
<P>
   For people like Becker, there is little the European Central
Bank can do to help. ``With overcapacity so high and prices so low,
there is nothing you can really do to stimulate the market,'' he
said. ``The market will come back only when the buying power of
consumers, mainly in Asia, comes back.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Economists note that manufacturing is only once facet of German
business and that Germany does not represent all of Europe.
Consumer confidence, even in Germany, is generally higher than it
has been in a long time. Although retail sales remain flat, people
are warming up to the use of credit cards, spending money on travel
and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   While most economists predict that Germany will grow less than 2
percent this year, down from 2.8 percent in 1998, Spain is growing
by 3.4 percent, Portugal 4 percent, and even France is expected to
grow by at least 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Those differences would make the European Central Bank's
decision tricky enough. But the bank is also concerned about
ensuring the credibility of the euro, which has dropped nearly 8
percent in value against the dollar since it was introduced on Jan.
4.
</P>
<P>
   Bank executives have repeatedly said that they are not concerned
about the exchange rate, viewing it merely as a result of
underlying economic trends. But they are worried about being
perceived as too relaxed on monetary policy or too vulnerable to
political pressure.
</P>
<P>
   The political pressures on the bank have in fact eased since
Germany's left-wing finance minister, Oskar Lafontaine, resigned
last month. In recent weeks, bank officials have dropped numerous
hints that they are more receptive to a rate reduction. They have
emphasized concerns about slowing economic growth and said they see
no signs of resurgent inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Economists are about evenly divided between those who expect a
rate cut on Thursday and those who do not. But investors have been
betting on a reduction _ if not on Thursday, then at the next
meeting on April 22 _ and they have expressed that view by pushing
down the value of the euro, which settled in New York Wednesday at
1.0772 to the dollar, down from 1.0848 on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not a clear decision, and there are several arguments
against it,'' said Stephan Bergheim, an economist at Merrill Lynch,
who is nonetheless betting on a rate reduction.
</P>
<P>
   A cut, he noted, would provide a bit of insurance against a
deeper economic slowdown. But it could also lower the euro's value
further and rekindle price pressures _ particularly with recent oil
price increases.
</P>
<P>
   What a rate cut would not do, he said, is rescue German industry
from its current doldrums.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main reason for the slowdown is export-related,'' he said,
``and there is not much that the ECB can do about that.''

COMMENTARY: THE OTHER AMERICA 
</HEADLINE>
  (kd) 
 By BOB HERBERT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. _ During the daylight hours the interior of
Nellie Perez's home is nearly as dark as night. She lives with her
disabled husband and five others in a dangerously rickety shack in
Guadalupe, a tiny poverty-racked town tucked in the midst of one of
the most affluent areas in America.
</P>
<P>
   Guadalupe is part of Maricopa County, one of the fastest-growing
counties in the country. Its neighbors, which include Phoenix,
Tempe, Paradise Valley and Scottsdale, are feasting on the nation's
unprecedented economic boom. Million-dollar homes and splendidly
manicured golf courses abound. Some of the malls are glittering
jewels.
</P>
<P>
   But as Andrew Cuomo, the U.S. secretary of housing and urban
development, said during a visit on Tuesday, Guadalupe is
different. It was not invited to the economic feast. ``That
wealth,'' said Cuomo, ``is not their wealth.''
</P>
<P>
   When night falls, Guadalupe, populated mostly by Yaqui Indians
and Mexican-Americans, goes to bed hungry.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Perez's home was built from scraps _ old doors, tarpaper,
chicken wire, rotted wooden planks. It is like something from the
Third World in the 19th century, not the United States on the verge
of the 21st. There is no bathroom, no running water, no electricity
and no heat. The air is so close it is difficult to breathe. When I
asked where the bathroom was, Mrs. Perez, an affable woman in her
50s, pointed across the street to a reeking outhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo stopped by the Perez dwelling during his daylong tour.
Mrs. Perez led him through the four dark and cluttered rooms. There
was no floor, only planks, or the bare ground. ``I'm sorry it's a
little bit dirty,'' Mrs. Perez said.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo has been trying to spread the word that even with the
economy booming, and the Dow hurdling the 10,000 barrier, and
millionaires being created at an astonishing rate, there are still
many Americans struggling with the equivalent of an economic
Depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``Real people are suffering,'' said Cuomo. ``And now is the time
to do something about that. Now is the time to invest in the things
we know how to do that would make their lives better, that would
bring housing and jobs to their communities _ now, when the economy
is strong and we have the largest surplus in history. If not now,
when?''
</P>
<P>
   Guadalupe is not an aberration. There are many pockets of
extreme poverty across the country. Cuomo mentioned the Indian
reservations, citing specifically the Pine Ridge Reservation in
South Dakota, home of the Oglala Sioux. He spoke of the continuing
poverty among African-Americans in the inner cities, and among
whites in parts of Appalachia and other rural areas. He spoke of
the struggles faced by poor Hispanic families in Arizona and in
Texas, especially those near the Mexican border.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dow at 10,000 almost makes the irony crueler,'' Cuomo
said. ``This phenomenon of terrific economic growth and yet so many
people just left out. There is no reason why in 1999 Americans
should be living in shacks, literally. This should be a nightmare
from the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo said his department was attempting to bring affordable
housing and economic opportunity to struggling Americans, but the
need is immense and he acknowledged that the resources available
from HUD were not nearly enough. He said he was trying to bring
more public attention to the plight of the poor. ``This is not
something you hear much about,'' he said. ``By definition the
people affected are voiceless, because they are poor. They are not
on television. They are not in the newspapers. For most Americans a
place like Guadalupe does not exist.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo seems to speak with more passion now than he did a few
years ago, and he seems more comfortable as he travels the country,
meeting with the powerful and listening to the powerless. His
message is one that has not been particularly popular for many
years now _ that the country as a whole has an obligation to do
what it can to assist those who are in danger of being left behind
economically.
</P>
<P>
   Before saying goodbye to Mrs. Perez on Tuesday, Cuomo asked if
she had ever heard of the Dow Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dow Jones?'' she said. ``What does that mean?''

ELECTRONIC FILING OF CAMPAIGN REPORTS GETS STRONG BACKING &HT;

 FILING-HNS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    By CLAY ROBISON 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Consumer and public interest groups teamed up
with lawmakers from both major parties Wednesday to strongly
endorse legislation to require state political candidates to file
their campaign finance reports electronically.
</P>
<P>
   The concept also picked up the conditional endorsement of Gov.
George W. Bush, who voluntarily filed his reports electronically
last year after the Houston Chronicle reported that he had failed
to keep a 1994 promise to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters said the requirement, which some other states already
have, would allow voters to more easily learn who is financing
races for public office by simply turning on their home computers
and connecting to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But the proposal ran into strong opposition from a key Democrat,
state Rep. Debra Danburg of Houston, chairwoman of the House
Elections Committee. She argued that it would benefit relatively
few people and require expensive software and other changes at the
Texas Ethics Commission to put in place.
</P>
<P>
   The Elections Committee heard testimony Wednesday afternoon on
several electronic filing bills but took no action.
</P>
<P>
   Among Republicans, the concept was endorsed by Lt. Gov. Rick
Perry, the House Republican Caucus and the leadership of the Texas
Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Scott McClellan said the governor ``supports
major candidates having to file electronically'' so that voters can
make ``informed decisions.'' However, the governor is not endorsing
a specific bill, and several have been filed on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are divided. Several Democratic legislators are
sponsoring electronic filing bills. But in addition to Danburg's
opposition, the Texas Democratic Party has reservations.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Cook, the party's executive director, said Democratic
leaders were concerned that modestly funded candidates would be
hurt by the requirements to file electronically, even though
several bills would exempt candidates who spend little money.
</P>
<P>
   Both major parties have opposed mandatory electronic filing in
the past.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Fred Lewis, an Austin attorney who heads a nonpartisan coalition
seeking electronic filing, said the bills would require candidates
and committees to file their finance reports by modem or diskette
for public review.
</P>
<P>
   ``That makes the data available to the public immediately
because once it's filed it can be placed on the Internet,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some candidates for statewide office and the Legislature already
voluntarily file their contribution and expenditure reports
electronically with the Texas Ethics Commission. The bills that
would require electronic filing would exempt candidates who raise
and spend only limited amounts of money.
</P>
<P>
   Even with those exceptions, Danburg said, many candidates would
have to spend a lot of money on a ``bunch of computer
technicians,'' when they could be spending the money on other
campaign activities.

   WASHINGTON _ The State Department warned nine Yugoslav

crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Commanders can be indicted, prosecuted and, if found guilty,
imprisoned not only for crimes they themselves commit, but also for
failing to prevent crimes occurring or for failure to prosecute
those who commit crimes,'' the State Department spokesman, James
Rubin, said at the opening of his press briefing Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin reiterated that the United States would provide evidence
to the international war crimes tribunal. The NATO spokesman in
Brussels, Belgium, Jamie Shea, has said repeatedly that NATO
governments would do just that.
</P>
<P>
   But tribunal officials raised questions Wednesday about whether
NATO actions matched the rhetoric, and there were also questions as
to what the tribunal was doing to gather evidence. Rubin said that
much of the evidence that the United States had against the nine
commanders came from interviews with refugees. Villagers are often
able to identify military units operating in an area, and it would
not be difficult for NATO to know the commanders of various units.
</P>
<P>
   Noticeably missing from the State Department's list of
commanders was the Yugoslav commander-in-chief and president,
Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   But speaking on the condition of anonymity, two senior American
officials, from different agencies of the government, said
Wednesday that they had no doubt that Milosevic bore responsibility
for the atrocities in Kosovo and should be indicted.
</P>
<P>
   One of them said he would personally like to deliver the
indictment to Milosevic. He added: ``I think there are a lot of
candidates that want that delivery job.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said Wednesday that he
would like to see Milosevic indicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ask me personally, I would say yes,'' he should be
indicted, Solana said in an interview with the BBC.
</P>
<P>
   That is also the view of NATO's supreme military commander, Gen.
Wesley Clark, a person who met with him recently said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   One problem the allies face in considering whether to push for
the indictment of Milosevic is political: It would be hard for the
allies to negotiate with Milosevic if he were an indicted war
criminal.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the question of evidence. The United States has
evidence that from the beginning, Milosevic sought to build a fire
wall around himself, to distance himself from indictable criminal
acts carried out against Muslims during the war in Bosnia, a senior
American official said last week.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has been in meetings where brutal operations against
civilians were discussed, but he has allowed his underlings to do
the talking, apparently fearing that the conversations might be
monitored by sophisticated listening devices, according to American
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   And whatever evidence the United States has gathered from
eavesdropping or telephone intercepts, it would be reluctant to
turn over to the tribunal for fear of exposing sources and methods,
American officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin, the State Department spokesman, said Wednesday that the
department would make some information ``of an intelligence
nature'' available to the tribunal, but he did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   At the tribunal Wednesday, the deputy prosecutor, Graham
Blewitt, expressed some irritation with the NATO allies and their
promises to help develop evidence of war crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the repeated statements out of Washington and
Brussels that war crimes were being committed in Kosovo and those
responsible would be punished, Blewitt said, ``that causes us some
frustration.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're being tantalized with this evidence,'' he said, adding
that the tribunal had not received as much as it expected from the
United States, Britain and other NATO countries based on their
public statements.
</P>
<P>
   Blewitt declined to say how much the tribunal itself was doing
to gather information.
</P>
<P>
   One tribunal official said that investigators were being taken
off other cases to work on the Kosovo cases. He declined to give
the number.
</P>
<P>
   A month ago, the tribunal had six people working on Kosovo, out
of a staff of nearly 800.
</P>
<P>
   American officials and human rights workers working among the
Kosovo refugees, who have personal accounts of atrocities, said
they did not believe that more than one tribunal investigator was
now in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin identified the Yugoslav commanders who have been warned as
follows:
</P>
<P>
   _ Col. Milos Mandic, 252nd Armored Brigade in central Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   _ Maj. Gen. Vladimir Lazarevic, Pristina Corps.
</P>
<P>
   _ Col. Mladen Cirkovic, 15th Armored Brigade, headquartered in
Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   _ Col. Dragan Zivanovic, 125th Motorized Brigade, headquartered
in Kosovska Mitrovica and Pec.
</P>
<P>
   _ Col. Krsman Jelic, 243rd Mechanized Brigade, headquartered in
Urosevac.
</P>
<P>
   _ Col. Bozidar Delic, 549th Motorized Brigade, headquartered in
Prizren and Djakovica.
</P>
<P>
   _ Col. Radojko Stefanovic, 52nd Mixed Artillery Brigade,
headquartered in Gnjilane.
</P>
<P>
   _ Col. Milos Djosan, 52nd Light Air Defense Artillery-Rocket
Regiment, headquartered in Djakovica.
</P>
<P>
   _ Maj. Zeljko Pekovic, 52nd Military Police Battalion,
headquartered in Pristina.

MARKET PLACE: MINUTES OF FED'S MEETINGS INCLUDE INTRIGUING
PHRASES 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee, the
policy-making arm of the Federal Reserve, can be more illuminating
than the cryptic utterances of the central bank's chairman, Alan
Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
   The release of the minutes from each meeting, though, is delayed
until after the next meeting is held, usually about six weeks
later. And by then the group's members _ Fed governors and some
presidents of the regional reserve banks _ have often conveyed
their thoughts to the financial markets in speeches and other ways.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the minutes from the November, December and February
meetings describe an important shift that has gone largely
unnoticed. Changes in just a few words indicate that Fed
policy-makers have all but discarded hope that the economy will
slow down significantly this year.
</P>
<P>
   If the economy does not slow, the Fed will be more likely to
raise interest rates later this year. Higher rates are used to
reduce the inflationary pressures that generally build in a rapidly
expanding economy but that have been nonexistent of late.
</P>
<P>
   Whether an economic slowdown materializes or not, the mere
expectation of one has helped persuade the Fed's policy-makers to
hold off raising short-term interest rates in recent years. With
such expectations dashed, they might have to adjust their thinking
as well, especially if inflation starts to rise moderately.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are beginning to recognize _ this is the process that you
are seeing in the minutes _ that their forecast for any type of
slowdown this year is not going to happen,'' said Ian Shepherdson,
chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they are changing their mind,'' he added, ``then it becomes
a question of when will they raise interest rates, not if they will
raise interest rates.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the minutes of the November meeting, with the
world's financial markets still in turmoil following Russia's
effective debt default, the central bank staff that prepares
economic forecasts for the policy-makers said that the economy
would slow ``to a pace appreciably below the estimated growth of
the economy's potential,'' which officials have suggested is around
2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That would mean a slowdown from the 6 percent pace of the fourth
quarter to a pace much closer to 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   By December, when American financial markets were rallying
again, the hope for such a slowdown was fading. According to that
meeting's minutes, the staff was then forecasting that growth in
the year ahead would slow ``to a pace somewhat below the estimated
growth of the economy's potential.''
</P>
<P>
   And in February, according to minutes released last week, any
suggestion of a significant slowdown seemed to vanish.
</P>
<P>
   The staff now predicted a slowdown ``to a rate commensurate with
the growth of the economy's potential,'' or about 2.5 percent
growth.
</P>
<P>
   But the policy-makers seemed to think the economy might be even
stronger than the staff suggested. Committee members, according to
the minutes, expected growth to slow ``to a pace close to or
somewhat above that of the economy's long-term potential.'' And
many members agreed that the biggest risk was that the economy
would grow at an even faster pace.
</P>
<P>
   At last week's meeting, Fed policy-makers left interest rates
alone. And they apparently left their policy indicator on neutral _
which means that in their view the next move on interest rates,
whenever that might be, is just as likely to be up as down.
</P>
<P>
   But the rising expectations for economic growth, as reflected in
their subtle word changes, may herald a change in attitude.
</P>
<P>
   Stand by. The minutes of the March meeting are scheduled for
release the third week of May.

NO AMNESTY FOR TWO MEN WHO KILLED BLACK LEADER IN SOUTH AFRICA
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ Ruling in one of its most
emotionally charged cases, South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation
Commission Wednesday denied amnesty to the two men who had
assassinated a popular black leader on the eve of South Africa's
first post-apartheid elections.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting of Chris Hani, the leader of the country's
Communist Party and the likely successor to President Nelson
Mandela, sent shock waves through the country and threatened to
derail the carefully negotiated transition from white supremacy.
</P>
<P>
   In its ruling, the commission found that the two right-wing
extremists convicted of gunning down Hani in his driveway had not
met the criteria for amnesty.
</P>
<P>
   The commission found that they had failed to tell the whole
truth about the event. And, the commission ruled, the men had acted
without the authority of the political party they belonged to,
therefore they did not have the necessary ``political mandate.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hani case has been one of the most watched cases before the
Truth Commission, drawing hundreds of spectators during weeks of
hearings in Pretoria. The Hani family, the Communist Party and the
ruling African National Congress fiercely opposed the granting of
amnesty.
</P>
<P>
   Janusz Walus, who fired the shots that killed Hani at his
Johannesburg home on Easter morning in 1993, and Clive Derby-Lewis,
who planned the killing and supplied the gun, were both sentenced
to death in 1993. But their sentences were commuted when the death
penalty was abolished by Mandela's government.
</P>
<P>
   In applying for amnesty, Derby-Lewis, a former Conservative
Party member of Parliament, said he had plotted the killing to
create chaos and spark a right-wing coup. Walus, a Polish immigrant
who fled to South Africa in 1981 to escape the communism he hated
in his homeland, said he had killed Hani to try to stop communists
taking power in his new home.
</P>
<P>
   But during hearings into their applications, both fluctuated
between combative and overly nonchalant answers. The commission,
which has the power to grant amnesty to those who had acted with
political motive and who confess all, found many of their
explanations to be less than truthful.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, it refused to believe Derby-Lewis when he said he
had bought a gun with a specially made silencer so that he would
not disturb his neighbors if he had to shoot at intruders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no hesitation in rejecting Derby-Lewis' evidence in
this regard,'' the commission said in its 25-page ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The applicants also gave several explanations for why a list of
ANC officials' names had been collected and numbered. At one point,
Derby-Lewis said this was a code so that the officials could be
discussed over the phone without mentioning names.
</P>
<P>
   Walus gave a different explanation: They were ordered according
to their enmity towards the Conservative Party.
</P>
<P>
   The commission flatly rejected these explanations, saying the
list, which included addresses and had a number 1 next to Mandela's
name, was clearly a hit list. The commission also found that the
Conservative Party had never authorized assassinations.
</P>
<P>
   Hani had been the chief of staff of the African National
Congress' armed wing. He returned home after the ANC and the
Communist Party were unbanned in 1990. He became a hugely popular
speaker in the black townships. At the time of his death, he was
ranked just behind Mandela in popularity polls.

ALBANIAN-AMERICANS SOUGHT AS TRANSLATORS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TATSHA ROBERTSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The crisis in their ancestral land hit home Wednesday
for dozens of Albanians in Boston, as the Red Cross began reaching
out to them to sacrifice a month of their time to help translate
for 20,000 refugees expected to arrive this week in Guantanomo Bay,
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Now, students, business owners and retirees in the Boston area _
the nation's second-largest Albanian American community _ are
wrestling with just how much they want their lives to be entangled
in this growing crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are saying to them `We need your help,' '' explained Renita
Hosler, spokesperson for the Boston chapter of the Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   The organization combed the Internet, and called churches and
radio shows, seeking people who speak the Albanian language and
know the Albanian culture. More than 120 callers have responded to
the plea, but most have been non-Albanians who can't speak the
language, said Hosler.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just really want to help,'' she said. ``But we need to be
prepared. We need to have speakers of the Albanian language.''
</P>
<P>
   William Botka is one who received the Red Cross's call. A
first-generation Albanian American, Botka said he and his wife,
Harriett are willing to sacrifice their time to help those in need.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need some help. This is horrendous. This has gone on much
too long,'' said Botka, a retired businessman from Framingham.
``There will be a lot of people at odds with themselves (in Cuba) _
happy to be away from where they were but still not living the kind
of life they are use to living. Nobody wants to be a refugee.''
</P>
<P>
   Albanian Americans say refugees, some already separated from
their families, are wary of living even temporarily in a place so
far from their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are mixed feelings. First of all, at least they
will be in a safe environment and some will be with their family
members,'' said The Rev. Arthur Liolin, chancellor of the Albanian
Orthodox Archdiocese.
</P>
<P>
   But Liolin and other local Albanian Americans said they were
sure the refugees are hungering for a return to a peaceful Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am absolutely sure that 99 percent of the Albanians want to
go back to Kosovo,'' said Ferik Abdullai, a native of the former
Yugoslav republic of Macedonia. ``But for them _ it's a welcome
change anywhere they go, but the bottom line is everyone wants to
go back home after the situation is resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House announced earlier this week that it was willing
to take 20,000 Kosovar Albanians as part of the NATO effort to
relocate about 120,000 refugees who would be airlifted out of the
Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Military authorities believe refugees could arrive at Guantanomo
Bay within the next two days, said Barry Higginbotham, spokesperson
for the Atlantic Fleet.
</P>
<P>
   By Thursday the first of 350 military engineers are expected to
arrive at the base to build 1500 tents which will house the
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   An additional 28 stretched tents, used in the early 1990s when
51,000 Cubans and Haitians were housed at the base, are already
available. Those tents will be used as schools, hospitals, and
kitchens, said Higginbotham.
</P>
<P>
   The local Red Cross is only anticipating that they will be
called to help out because the Boston-Worcester area, with an
estimated 60,000 Albanian Americans, is one of the largest
communities in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the local Albanians are orthodox christians, sharing the
same religion as the Serbs but not the same culture, said Liolin.
The first Albanian immigrant arrived in Massachusetts around 1886,
he said. But sometime around 1912, during the beginning of the
Balkan War, hundreds of Albanian immigrants arrived in Boston and
Worcester, creating a large community.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Red Cross officials worry they will have a hard time
recruiting a few dozen people who are willing to be away from home
for so long.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is the realistic side _ it's very hard to pack up a
suitcase and leave families and a job for a month,'' said Hosler.
``Some would like to help but they know they have their lives they
need to live.''
</P>
<P>
   Those willing to go to Cuba are likely to be retirees and
students, said Regina Szwadzka, a coordinator of International
Services for the Boston chapter of Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers must be willing to stay for a three-week assignment
and to be trained to deal with mental and psychological anguish of
the refugees, said Szwadzka.
</P>
<P>
   Even local Albanian American students, eager to help, are
worried they could miss their final exams, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullai said he wishes he could travel to Cuba but he must tend
to his Pizza restaurant in Webster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be very glad to help my people in Albania but what am
I going to do with my restaurant?'' he said. ``If I go then my
business will go.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rev. Liolin, who has been calling members of his church,
insists that many area residents of Albanian ancestry will answer
the call for help.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just starting,'' he said. ``The response is very
favorable. People really want to go.''

 &HT;    Five Georgia firms repeat Fortune 500 performances
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Home Depot, United Parcel Service, BellSouth,
Coca-Cola and Delta Air Lines turned in repeat performances this
year on the latest list of the 500 biggest U.S. corporations,
Fortune (April 26) reports.
</P>
<P>
   Ranked by sales, they were first through fifth among companies
headquartered in Georgia, for the second straight year. But while
Home Depot was tops on the Georgia list, it ranked 32nd on the list
of 500.
</P>
<P>
   The rankings are based on fiscal 1998 financial results.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, 15 Georgia-based companies are among the prestigious
Fortune 500. In order, the others are Coca-Cola Enterprises,
Georgia-Pacific, the Southern Co., SunTrust Banks, AFLAC, Genuine
Parts, First Data, Shaw Industries, Flowers Industries and AGCO.
</P>
<P>
   The top five nationally are General Motors, Ford Motor, Wal-Mart
Stores, Exxon and General Electric.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia ranks 11th in the nation as a headquarters state, with
15 companies, and metro Atlanta ranks fourth among cities with 11.
New York state and New York City topped both those lists.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Coca-Cola and Georgia-Pacific have made the most
frequent appearances on Georgia's top-five list. Starting in 1997,
economic problems in Asia and elsewhere affected Georgia-Pacific's
performance. It ranks seventh among Georgia companies on the latest
list.
</P>
<P>
   The Fortune 500 list was composed of industrial corporations
until 1995, when the magazine's editors decided to diversify the
list to reflect the increasing role of service companies in the
U.S. economy. That was the first year that BellSouth and Delta Air
Lines made the list.
</P>
<P>
   Worth mentioning...
</P>
<P>
   _ Corporations have always had a public relations problem with
populist-minded Americans, and the latest battleground is the Web.
Business Week (April 12) says hundreds of Web sites have been
created by a variety of disgruntled consumers and business critics.
The criticism is defended by the Supreme Court as a First Amendment
right, which has forced corporations to learn to fight back on the
Web, the magazine says.
</P>
<P>
   _ Many small vendors are willing to take their lumps as the
price of doing business with Wal-Mart, the world's biggest
retailer, according to Inc. (April). But Chuck Mitchell, the CEO of
a small company that makes automatic gates, took his beef against
Wal-Mart to court in David and Goliath fashion _ and got his money
back. _ The revamped Georgia Trend (April) is out with its annual
economic yearbook, which looks at Georgia's economy from the
mountains to the sea.

 &HT;    CheckFree stock riding Net's wave
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Shares of CheckFree got a boost Wednesday from the
Internet stock explosion, hitting a 52-week high and closing at
$54.06 1/4, up $7.
</P>
<P>
   The electronic and Web-based bill-payment processor's stock is
up about 26 percent the last five days, 131 percent for 1999. Since
a 52-week low of $5.75 in early October, CheckFree shares are up
840 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Terrie O'Hanlon, CheckFree's senior vice president of corporate
and investor relations, attributed the share surge to: more
attention on Web-based bill paying and receiving; increased analyst
coverage; the relative affordability of CheckFree's stock; and the
fact CheckFree is starting to be viewed as an Internet-related
stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think CheckFree is starting to be seen as a back-door
Internet play, and these stocks are starting to complement the
front door Internet stocks like Amazon.com and Yahoo!,'' she said.
``There are three Internet plays: hardware and technology
infrastructure companies like Cisco Systems; front-end companies
like Yahoo! and Excite and Amazon.com; and the companies that will
help them get content to keep customers coming back. CheckFree is
one of those.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the increase in online shopping and online stock
trading is making people more comfortable with the idea of getting
and paying their bills online.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Crest Securities Deutsche Bank Research started covering
CheckFree last month. Pacific Crest analyst Rob D. Owens rated
CheckFree a ``strong buy.''
</P>
<P>
   He expects its shares to be selling for $61 within 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank analyst James Marks rates it a ``buy'' and expects
shares to be selling for $70 within a year.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Franco, an analyst with U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray, thinks
CheckFree shares are up for two reasons, the first being a Wall
Street Journal article about Yahoo!, a media company that has the
Web's busiest site.
</P>
<P>
   The article said Yahoo! is interested in buying companies or
forming alliances.
</P>
<P>
   CheckFree announced in January it signed a distribution deal
with an Internet portal. Avivah Litan, a Gartner Group analyst,
said CheckFree's deal is with Yahoo! But CheckFree has not
commented.
</P>
<P>
   Franco thinks investors may have misread the article and
mistakenly thought CheckFree would be bought by Yahoo!.
</P>
<P>
   The second cause may be an announcement last weekend that Wells
Fargo bank has enrolled 150,000 customers in its online banking
services, Franco said.
</P>
<P>
   CheckFree has an agreement with Wells Fargo. Even though there's
no guarantee all the new enrollees would pay their bills via
CheckFree, it makes it that much more likely that CheckFree will
add customers, Franco said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the near term, it's not too exciting,'' Franco said. ``But
Wells Fargo has a long-term track record of converting these
customers over to online bill paying.''
</P>
<P>
   Franco rates CheckFree a ``strong buy'' with a six-month target
price of $53.

 &HT;    Steak take-out chain beefs up expansion plans
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Steak-Out Franchising Inc. is branching out to other
regions and perhaps other countries in an aggressive expansion
plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are basically looking at going into new markets outside of
the South,'' Don Harkleroad, president and CEO, said Wednesday.
``We think the concept is solidly proven, and now we have the
infrastructure to the point where we can support the growth.''
</P>
<P>
   The company, which operates a full-meal delivery system
specializing in steak, has 35 units under development in Colorado,
Kansas and Texas. Other markets under consideration include New
York, New Jersey and Minnesota. The company said it has had
inquiries about overseas expansion.
</P>
<P>
   There are 79 Steak-Out Charbroiled Delivery stores. The company
offers catering and takeout.
</P>
<P>
   The business was formed in 1988, and Harkleroad acquired it
several years later.
</P>
<P>
   But Harkleroad said the company, which has revenues of $62
million, plans to build on its base in this region. Plans call for
another 26 stores in the Southeast, with eight in metro Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The company also plans to move its training facility from
Columbia, S.C., to metro Atlanta.

 &HT;    DuPont to invest $220 million in WebMD
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ WebMD said Wednesday that chemical giant DuPont will
invest $220 million over five years in the Atlanta-based Internet
medical services provider and take two seats on its board.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement with DuPont is the latest in a string of big deals
WebMD has recently struck. Among others are agreements with CNN and
Lycos. The company has raised $70 million from various partnerships
since July and is planning to go public sometime this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The investment will make DuPont WebMD's largest single source of
revenue and greatly advance the company's goal of becoming the
leading brand for health care services on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be the Amazon.com of health care for the Web,''
said WebMD Chairman and Chief Executive Jeff Arnold, referring to
the Net's largest seller of books and music CDs. ``This investment
is a vote of confidence in our company.''
</P>
<P>
   What DuPont gets in exchange for its investment is a
high-profile start for a new unit called Digital Consumer Health,
which will provide online medical and health information.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the deal, DuPont becomes WedMD's exclusive
provider of information about medicines, vitamins and nutrition.
WebMD will use that information to create a new section on its
popular site dedicated to what both companies call life sciences.
</P>
<P>
   DuPont's pharmaceutical arm is one of the largest makers of
drugs and vitamins. Its brands include AIDS treatment drug Sustiva,
anticoagulant Coumadin and Revia, which helps alcoholics curb the
desire to drink.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an important new step for DuPont,'' said Kurt
Landgraf, a DuPont executive vice president. ``WebMD is the first
place consumers will meet DuPont on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Launched early last October, WebMD is a play for the attention
and pocketbooks of some 30 million people who search the Internet
for medical information. These people spend an estimated $150
billion annually on medical services, according to a recent survey.
</P>
<P>
   WebMD is trying to lure both consumers and doctors and put the
two in touch with one another through its Internet services.
</P>
<P>
   Access is free for consumers but doctors pay $29.95 a month to
use WebMD's various Internet services. More than 2,000 doctors have
subscribed to those services so far, said Arnold.
</P>
<P>
   Services for doctors include an online medical library,
real-time insurance verification and continuing medical education
courses.
</P>
<P>
   DuPont's investment will play a key role in expanding the pay
service for doctors, said Arnold. He explained that $180 million of
the money would be used to buy subscriptions for physicians. WebMD
will use those subscriptions as trial memberships for doctors as
well as in other promotional efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining $40 million buys DuPont its exclusivity as WebMD's
provider of pharmaceutical and related information.
</P>
<P>
   DuPont will also get an undisclosed equity stake in WebMD.
</P>
<P>
   The deal between WebMD and DuPont extends beyond information.
DuPont will also help recruit other pharmaceutical companies to
WebMD.
</P>
<P>
   Explained Arnold, ``DuPont will quarterback a larger effort for
us to pull the pharmaceutical industry together behind our
service.''

NATO COMMANDER SEEKS MORE AIR POWER TO PRESS ATTACK AGAINST
YUGOSLAVS

<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ NATO's senior military commander, Gen.
Wesley Clark, said on Wednesday that he wanted significantly more
American and allied warplanes to intensify NATO's attack on
Yugoslavia, and the Pentagon assured him he would get whatever he
needs.
</P>
<P>
   With the allies continuing to rule out ground forces and engaged
in a military operation tougher than expected, Clark has been
forced to seek still more air power and employ new tactics. These
have included stepped up patrols over Kosovo, luring the Serbs out
of their hiding places so they can be bombed and low-level attacks.
</P>
<P>
   As the third week of bombing began, Clark said he was
considering several options to further expand the alliance's
striking power, but declined to disclose details. A senior NATO
official said the general wanted ``vastly increased assets'' over
the 600 aircraft already involved. A major aim would be to improve
NATO's ability to bomb Yugoslav armored forces in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of Defense William Cohen, who met with Clark on
Wednesday at the general's headquarters near Brussels, said the
Pentagon would provide whatever forces the commander needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever General Clark feels he needs to carry out this
campaign successfully, he will receive,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Plans for intensifying the military campaign came as Slobodan
Milosevic has sought to exploit tensions within the Western
alliance by declaring a unilateral cease-fire and offering to
negotiate with the Kosovars.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has rejected Milosevic's proposal as sorely deficient. But
Belgrade's maneuvers have increased the pressure on the alliance to
break the will of its adversary before political factors interfere.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is no time to pause,'' Cohen said at NATO headquarters on
Wednesday. ``We will reject any settlement that freezes the results
of Milosevic's genocide.''
</P>
<P>
   Military officials noted that the Serbs did not appear to be
observing their own cease-fire. ``We've seen no change in the
pattern on the ground,'' Clark said. ``In fact, we've seen the
opposite.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the raids began on March 24, the United States and its
allies have steadily increased the number of aircraft involved in
the attack. After the Yugoslav military surprised NATO by launching
a brutal campaign to evict ethnic Albanians from Kosovo, the number
of warplanes grew from 430 to more than 600, including 75 combat
and support aircraft on the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt,
which joined the raids on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, NATO flew 439 bombing, fighting and support
missions, the largest number since the campaign began. The planes
pounded command posts, fuel depots, air defenses and, according to
a NATO military spokesman, scored its first major ``breakthrough''
against Serbian forces in the field.
</P>
<P>
   That occurred when a patrol of British Harrier jet caught a
Serbian armored column on the move north of Pristina and attacked
it with cluster munitions. The NATO spokesman, Commodore David
Wilby, said that some of the seven to 12 vehicles in that column
were damaged or destroyed. But he acknowledged that other attempts
to bomb Serb columns were not successful.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides, however, appear to be preparing for a long and
grueling fight. Yugoslavia's strategy is to ride out the allied air
strikes in the hope that NATO's unity will crack. On Wednesday,
Western military officials said the Serbs are continuing to hunker
down and hide their tanks and heavy weapons in churches, forests
and near civilian buildings.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has also received reports that the Serbs might be herding
some of the fleeing Albanians back from border areas and putting
them near Yugoslav military forces in an effort to ward off allied
attacks. Allied officials said, however, that they could not
confirm these reports. The alliance has sought to counter the Serbs
by employing new tactics. One approach, an allied military officer
said, is to maximum the element of surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Serb forces, for example, had become accustomed to leaving their
hiding places soon after allied military planes pass overhead,
trying to take advantage of gaps in the allied patrols to attack
the ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   So NATO warplanes have been changing the timing of their combat
flights to make them less predictable. Sometimes planes have been
sent soaring over Serb positions with other allied aircraft flying
close behind. NATO has also stepped up its day-time patrols, hoping
to catch Serb columns on the move.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have ramped up operations,'' Wilby said on Wednesday. ``We
are keeping aircraft over the area as long as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   British Harriers, for example, are no longer attacking in group
of six aircraft. Instead, they are attacking in pairs, which
maximizes the time they can loiter over the battlefield. The
French, too, have stepped up their low-level attacks, using Jaguar
and Super-Etendard aircraft. Even with better weather and new
tactics, Clark made it clear that Yugoslavia's military remains a
potent enemy that required still more firepower.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yugoslavia has a very, very significant military
infrastructure and a full array of military forces, with alternate
and secondary positions, with storage depots, very well concealed
and dispersed,'' he said. ``There are many, many targets that have
not been struck. We know where they are. We're coming after them.''
</P>
<P>
   At Clark's request, the United States has already dispatched
another dozen F-117 ``stealth'' fighters and five B-1 bombers. The
Pentagon has also approved the deployment of 24 Apache helicopter
gunships to Albania, though officials said it could take a week or
longer to send them.
</P>
<P>
   General Clark's request for additional air power first arose at
a meeting with the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen.
Henry Shelton, who visited NATO's headquarters on Tuesday. A
Pentagon official familiar with the discussion said that Clark felt
he could make better use of the clear skies if he had more planes.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, the official said, Clark believed the campaign
could use additional A-10 jets, designed to kill tanks, and B-1
bombers, which are able to drop enormously lethal clusters of bombs
on ground forces. Although Italy's air fields are already
overcrowded, the official said NATO could not take full advantage
of the recent good weather because it had no more planes to use.
</P>
<P>
   ''The problem is he's got more than he can handle when there's
bad weather,'' the official said, referring to the many nights NATO
has had to scrub bombing runs because of rain and clouds. ``What he
wants are more assets when there's good weather.''

 &HT;    Salon.com buys pioneer Net site
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Salon.com, the online magazine of politics, arts and
opinion, has acquired a pioneering Internet community, the Well
(www.well.com).
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the deal were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   The Well was founded in 1985 by Stuart Brand, publisher of the
Whole Earth Catalogue, and technologist Larry Brilliant.
</P>
<P>
   In the early days of the Internet, before the World Wide Web,
the Well was a hot destination for Net surfers looking to connect
with like-minded souls. It featured discussion groups on a variety
of topics including parents of children with disabilities, Grateful
Dead fans, jazz aficionados and gardening.
</P>
<P>
   The Well is a members-only (about 7,000 members) community,
which costs $10-15 per year depending on the type of service. Salon
says it will continue to operate it as a distinct online community
linked to the newly revamped Salon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Salon.com, which changed its name and added more staff and areas
to its Web site Monday, says the Well complements what Salon is
trying to do. ``The Well and Salon have a shared heritage of
stimulating conversation,'' said former Well owner Bruce Katz in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   David Talbot, Salon founder and chief executive, moved the
magazine into the limelight last year with its controversial
coverage of the Clinton impeachment scandal. Talbot saw the Well as
a model for what he said was ``community-building that the Net
makes possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Well Executive Director Gail Ann Williams said there has always
been a friendly relationship between the two companies. Cliff
Figallo, Salon's director of community development, was the Well's
second director. Another Salon staffer, Table Talk host Mary Beth
Williams, also hosts a free-lance writers conference on the Well.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are very strong ties, and we have always been very aware
of each other,'' Williams says. ``The founding members of Salon did
some of the primary planning in a private conference on the Well.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said the Well and Salon are respectful of each other's
online communities. ``The Well is an existing community, and
Salon's Table Talk is also an established community with its own
relationships. And there's no reason to mess with that,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Salon hopes to be able to draw on the Well's ability to build
and maintain a subscription-based revenue stream, but Williams says
it's too soon to say just how.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so early for us,'' she says. ``I feel like a pioneer. I
was a pioneer when I logged onto the Well in 1990, and I feel like
a pioneer again.''

AGENT TESTIFIES GANG PLANNED TO BLOW UP CITY'S POLICE HEADQUARTERS &HT;    
 &HT;   
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    By MARK SMITH 
and STEVE OLAFSON 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Believing they were being interviewed by academics
studying gang activity, members of a gang revealed plans to blow up
Freeport's police headquarters and an officer's house with stolen
explosives, a federal agent testified Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The purported college professors and graduate students who
gained the trust of the ``Vatos Locos'' _ Spanish slang for ``crazy
guys'' _ turned out to be undercover agents who secretly recorded
the gang members as they proudly discussed their activities,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They bought it hook, line and sinker,'' Freeport Police Chief
Evelyn H. Gonzalez said of the ruse by Drug Enforcement
Administration agents. Freeport is a coastal city of 13,000 south
of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The plot to use stolen plastic explosives from Fort Hood was
discussed in testimony by DEA Special Agent Wendell Campbell during
a federal arraignment hearing for David Rangel, 21, the alleged
head of the Vatos Locos.
</P>
<P>
   Rangel and 11 other gang members or relatives have been indicted
on various drug-trafficking offenses in connection with the sale of
crack cocaine. He is charged with conspiracy to distribute cocaine,
possession with intent to distribute cocaine and employing a minor
to distribute cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatos Locos planned to drill a hole in a wall at police
headquarters, plant C-4 plastic explosive and detonate it by
shooting it from a distance, Campbell testified.
</P>
<P>
   He said the gang, which has 40 to 50 members, also schemed to
use the explosives on the home of a Freeport officer and against
rival gangs.
</P>
<P>
   Although they had obtained about 4{ pounds of the explosive _ an
amount that police compared to a 500-pound bomb _ the gang members
apparently did not have a detonator. Campbell said it would be
highly unlikely that the material could be set off by shooting it.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities first learned that the gang had obtained plastic
explosives after they were found in a junked car in Clute in
January 1998. The owner of the car called police after finding the
material in a duffel bag in the car.
</P>
<P>
   After tracing serial numbers on the explosives, Campbell said,
federal agents and military authorities determined that they had
been stolen from a military stockpile at Fort Hood, an Army base in
Central Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Federal authorities destroyed the explosives and the FBI is
still investigating the theft, Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, the Freeport chief, said that even though the gang
didn't have a detonator to make the explosives lethal, police took
their threats seriously and asked federal authorities to join the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   She declined to name the officers the gang members targeted but
said they also spoke of blowing up a local bank.
</P>
<P>
   In Wednesday's hearing, before U.S. Magistrate Judge Calvin
Botley, Rangel, wearing shorts, sandals and a torn gray T-shirt,
pleaded not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Botley ordered Rangel jailed without bond, saying that Rangel
has a ``continuous history'' of criminal activity and might attempt
to flee if he were released on bond.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Botley cited a list of Rangel's prior arrests on charges
including harassment, retaliation and terroristic threats,
manufacture and distribution of cocaine, theft of services, auto
theft, aggravated assault with a firearm and delivery of a
controlled substance.
</P>
<P>
   Rangel also is unemployed and allegedly conducted the leadership
of the gang from his mother's Freeport home, Botley said.
</P>
<P>
   DEA agents have been helping to investigate the gang since 1997,
when Freeport police sought their aid, Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   Damaging evidence was gained last August and September, during
interviews when federal agents posed as out-of-state university
professors and graduate students researching the gang's activities,
Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   In several days of interviews that were secretly audio- and
videotaped, he testified, gang members identified Rangel as their
leader and described initiations known as ``click ins' or ''kick
ins,`` in which members were beaten and given bags of crack cocaine
to sell.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell said the members range in age from 15 to 25.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez said the gang members were eager to talk about their
exploits for what they thought would be an academic survey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of these gang members are pretty proud of themselves,''
she said.

ALBANIAN-AMERICANS SOUGHT AS TRANSLATORS

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The crisis in their ancestral land hit home Wednesday
for dozens of Albanians in Boston, as the Red Cross began reaching
out to them to sacrifice a month of their time to help translate
for 20,000 refugees expected to arrive this week in Guantanomo Bay,
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Now, students, business owners and retirees in the Boston area _
the nation's second-largest Albanian American community _ are
wrestling with just how much they want their lives to be entangled
in this growing crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are saying to them `We need your help,' '' explained Renita
Hosler, spokesperson for the Boston chapter of the Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   The organization combed the Internet, and called churches and
radio shows, seeking people who speak the Albanian language and
know the Albanian culture. More than 120 callers have responded to
the plea, but most have been non-Albanians who can't speak the
language, said Hosler.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just really want to help,'' she said. ``But we need to be
prepared. We need to have speakers of the Albanian language.''
</P>
<P>
   William Botka is one who received the Red Cross's call. A
first-generation Albanian American, Botka said he and his wife,
Harriett are willing to sacrifice their time to help those in need.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need some help. This is horrendous. This has gone on much
too long,'' said Botka, a retired businessman from Framingham.
``There will be a lot of people at odds with themselves (in Cuba) _
happy to be away from where they were but still not living the kind
of life they are use to living. Nobody wants to be a refugee.''
</P>
<P>
   Albanian Americans say refugees, some already separated from
their families, are wary of living even temporarily in a place so
far from their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are mixed feelings. First of all, at least they
will be in a safe environment and some will be with their family
members,'' said The Rev. Arthur Liolin, chancellor of the Albanian
Orthodox Archdiocese.
</P>
<P>
   But Liolin and other local Albanian Americans said they were
sure the refugees are hungering for a return to a peaceful Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am absolutely sure that 99 percent of the Albanians want to
go back to Kosovo,'' said Ferik Abdullai, a native of the former
Yugoslav republic of Macedonia. ``But for them _ it's a welcome
change anywhere they go, but the bottom line is everyone wants to
go back home after the situation is resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House announced earlier this week that it was willing
to take 20,000 Kosovar Albanians as part of the NATO effort to
relocate about 120,000 refugees who would be airlifted out of the
Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Military authorities believe refugees could arrive at Guantanomo
Bay within the next two days, said Barry Higginbotham, spokesperson
for the Atlantic Fleet.
</P>
<P>
   By Thursday the first of 350 military engineers are expected to
arrive at the base to build 1500 tents which will house the
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   An additional 28 stretched tents, used in the early 1990s when
51,000 Cubans and Haitians were housed at the base, are already
available. Those tents will be used as schools, hospitals, and
kitchens, said Higginbotham.
</P>
<P>
   The local Red Cross is only anticipating that they will be
called to help out because the Boston-Worcester area, with an
estimated 60,000 Albanian Americans, is one of the largest
communities in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the local Albanians are orthodox christians, sharing the
same religion as the Serbs but not the same culture, said Liolin.
The first Albanian immigrant arrived in Massachusetts around 1886,
he said. But sometime around 1912, during the beginning of the
Balkan War, hundreds of Albanian immigrants arrived in Boston and
Worcester, creating a large community.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Red Cross officials worry they will have a hard time
recruiting a few dozen people who are willing to be away from home
for so long.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is the realistic side _ it's very hard to pack up a
suitcase and leave families and a job for a month,'' said Hosler.
``Some would like to help but they know they have their lives they
need to live.''
</P>
<P>
   Those willing to go to Cuba are likely to be retirees and
students, said Regina Szwadzka, a coordinator of International
Services for the Boston chapter of Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers must be willing to stay for a three-week assignment
and to be trained to deal with mental and psychological anguish of
the refugees, said Szwadzka.
</P>
<P>
   Even local Albanian American students, eager to help, are
worried they could miss their final exams, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullai said he wishes he could travel to Cuba but he must tend
to his Pizza restaurant in Webster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be very glad to help my people in Albania but what am
I going to do with my restaurant?'' he said. ``If I go then my
business will go.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rev. Liolin, who has been calling members of his church,
insists that many area residents of Albanian ancestry will answer
the call for help.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just starting,'' he said. ``The response is very
favorable. People really want to go.''

   BOSTON -- Boston College has purchased two Georgian townhouses
on St. Stephen's Green in Dublin, the first step to what the school
hopes will ultimately become a BC campus in Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston College Center in Ireland, as it will be known when
it opens in the fall, will house the newly created BC-Ireland
Corp., as well as the school's Irish Institute, and will provide
library and administrative resources for student exchange programs.
</P>
<P>
   The plans for an Irish campus are still at least several years
away.
</P>
<P>
   But clearly, BC officials see the purchase of the property as a
badge of true green: they point out that the University of Notre
Dame, BC's traditional rival, has only rented property in Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   The school said the center would establish BC as the preeminent
US university working in Ireland, and serve as the hub of BC's
outreach to political, business, and education leaders in Ireland
and Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, it also has great symbolic meaning,'' said BC
president the Rev. William Leahy. ``It represents a recommitment to
the homeland of BC's Jesuit founding fathers who invested so much
of themselves in establishing Boston College 136 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The property, renovated 254-year-old buildings at 42 and 43 St.
Stephen's Green, is close to Grafton Street and the Irish
Parliament buildings.

 &HT;    FEARS GROW THAT RETURNING REFUGEES MAY BE USED AS HUMAN SHIELDS
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;    EDS: Optional trim at 750
 &HT;    NOTE: The State Department warned nine Serb commanders about
possible war crimes. They are named separately at the end of this
story.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON Yugoslav troops sealed a crowded Albanian border
crossing Wednesday, ordering tens of thousands of refugees fleeing
Kosovo to turn back and march into an area where NATO warplanes
have focused furious attacks in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   Amid fears that the civilians might be used as human shields,
the Pentagon said the refugees could complicate attacks on Yugoslav
troops and tanks. At the same time, the State Department warned
nine Serb commanders by name that they could be held accountable
for any war crimes their forces commit.
</P>
<P>
   The warning came on a day when NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said
Yugoslav troops had already begun holding ethnic Albanians as
``human shields,'' near artillery pieces prime targets of
increasingly aggressive NATO air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and allied forces pressed their air war into its 16th day
early Thursday, dropping bombs and firing cruise missiles at
military forces and facilities across Yugoslavia. The air campaign
seeks to end repression that has driven more than 1 million ethnic
Albanians from their homes in the province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Two explosions rocked central Belgrade around midnight local
time near Yugoslav army headquarters, the Associated Press reported
from the Yugoslav capital. There were reports of other explosions
in the industrial town of Pancevo, to the north.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, former Cypriot President Spyros Kyprianou was
scheduled to fly from Athens to Belgrade on Thursday to meet with
Yugoslavia's president, Slododan Milosevic, over the possible
release of three U.S. soldiers captured last week near Yugoslavia's
border with Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and NATO officials said they would guarantee safe passage
for Kyprianou's aircraft. They said they would welcome the release
of the Americans, but would not halt the air campaign regardless of
the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``If President Milosevic does the civilized thing and releases
them, we would welcome that,'' said Shea. ``But, as for paying a
price, of course not. The mission goes on.''
</P>
<P>
   As the number of ethnic Albanians fleeing Kosovo's borders
surged above 600,000 with more than 400,000 others believed
displaced inside Kosovo there were signs that the exodus was
triggering desperation in neighboring states.
</P>
<P>
   In Blace, Macedonia, authorities emptied a transit camp of
35,000 refugees without warning in a heavy-handed sweep so chaotic
that panicked families were separated and scant belongings left
behind as refugees were jammed into buses or forced onto aircraft.
They were transferred to camps as far away as Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Details were sketchy. But in an operation the United Nations
High Commissioner on Refugees described as ``a situation of mass
confusion,'' roughly 10,000 refugees were shunted to neighboring
Albania, 25,000 more to camps deep inside Macedonia and hundreds of
others were flown to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   The mounting refugee crisis has placed an unanticipated burden
on NATO planners reacting day by day to difficult and changing
battlefield conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The forced transfer of an estimated 25,000 refugees back into
embattled Kosovo, however, portended a potentially more ominous
crisis, some analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in trouble right now, big trouble,'' said former U.S.
Army Col. William Taylor, a defense expert at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank.
``Forget strategic bombing in that region of Kosovo,'' said Taylor.
``We're not going to hit them with air power not while they have
hostages.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking advantage of four successive nights of relatively clear
skies, NATO forces have hammered at Yugoslav army troops and police
units deployed across a swath of southwest Kosovo, roughly parallel
to the Albanian border.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, for example, officials said a column of armored
vehicles was destroyed by a massive attack that mixed supersonic
B-1 bombers, dropping wide-area tank-piercing cluster bombs, with
low-altitude strikes by A-10 Warthog jets, built to knock out tanks
and armored personnel carriers.
</P>
<P>
   F-18 Hornet and F-14 Tomcat fighter bombers flying from the USS
Roosevelt aircraft carrier in the Mediterranean also pounded troops
in the same sector, as did British Harriers and other warplanes.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and allied pilots flew 439 sorties over Yugoslavia on
Wednesday, hitting 28 fixed targets and several groups of tanks and
troops in the field, NATO air commodore David Wilby told reporters
at alliance headquarters in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today the weather remains good, and we continue to put heavy
emphasis on our operations against forces in the field,'' said
Wilby.
</P>
<P>
   Those forces have been concentrated for days in a rectangular
pocket of southwestern Kosovo. Troops have concealed tanks in
forests and abandoned buildings, near churches and, in some places,
among remaining civilian populations.
</P>
<P>

</P>

   Story Can End Here. Optional Add Follows

</P>
<P>
   By and large, though, civilians had fled the region over the
past two weeks in the face of advancing Yugoslav troops who have
shelled, torched and terrorized one village after another.
</P>
<P>
   Early Wednesday, however, Yugoslav forces sealed off the border
near the Albanian town of Morina, several miles from the southern
edge of the most intensive NATO strikes on Yugoslav ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   By late Wednesday, Pentagon officials said thousands of refugees
who had hoped to cross into Albania at Morina had been forced to
return to their ravaged villages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our understanding is they have been asked to move back into
Kosovo and they're dispersing,'' said Air Force Maj. Gen. Charles
Wald, vice director of strategic plans and policy for the U.S.
Joint Chiefs of Staff. ``We're not sure where they are.''
</P>
<P>
   That complicates efforts to hit military units from the air,
particularly through the use of wide area cluster bombs, which NATO
has resisted using in areas near civilian centers or refugee
routes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will NATO be looking for those? Of course we will,'' said
Wald. ``We always are very careful about collateral damage. That's
one of the difficulties of this mission, is where the civilians
are.''
</P>
<P>
   Without accusing Milosevic of using the refugees as human
shields, he made clear his concern over that prospect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Using refugees as a tool for his strategy obviously is
something that we as professionals aren't used to to doing or
understanding,'' said Wald. ``You'd have to get into Milosevic's
mind to see what he's trying to do with those refugees.''
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman James Rubin did not directly link his
warning on war crimes with the forced movement of civilians back
into the battle zone.
</P>
<P>
   Several hours after that development, though, Rubin said ``we're
deeply alarmed'' by the move.
</P>
<P>
   Forcing civilians into harm's way is a violation of the Geneva
Conventions, the basis of international law governing the behavior
of troops during hostilities.
</P>
<P>
   NATO is investigating alleged atrocities committed by Yugoslav
forces in nearly 50 different villages or communities across
Kosovo, where ethnic Serbs have targeted ethnic Albanians, who make
up 90 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. diplomat David Scheffer, ambassador at large for war crimes
issues, interviewed roughly 200 ethnic Albanian refugees at Blace,
Macedonia last week. He has concluded from the eyewitness reports
that Serb troops, police and paramilitary units have committed
widespread atrocities across Kosovo since NATO air strikes began
March 24.
</P>
<P>
   ENDIT
</P>
<P>
   EDS: State Department spokesman James Rubin named nine
commanders he said have recently overseen the operations in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Mandic, commander of the 252nd armored brigade, deployed in
central Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Gen. Vladimir Lazuruvic, commander of the Pristina Corps,
Third Army.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Mladin Serkovic, commander of the 15th Armored Brigade in
Pristina. (NATO has reported that this unit was one of three that
pinned down fleeing refugees in the Pagarusa Valley, where they
were repeatedly shelled.)
</P>
<P>
   Col. Dragan Djovanovic, commander of the 125th Motorized Brigade
in Pec and elsewhere. (NATO reported last week that Yugoslav tanks
virtually destroyed Pec, a centuries-old city in western Kosovo.)
</P>
<P>
   Col. Djelic, commander of the 243rd Mechanized Brigade,
headquartered in Jurasovec. (NATO reported that this unit was also
involved in the Pagarusa Valley operation.)
</P>
<P>
   Col. Delic, commander of the 549th Motorized Brigade in Prizren.
(Also involved in Pagarusa Valley.)
</P>
<P>
   Col. Stephanovic, commander of the 52nd Mixed Artillery Brigade.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Djozen, commander of the 52nd Light Air Defense Artillery
Rocket Regiment in Djakovica. (scene of some of the most intensive
repression.)
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Pekovic, commander of the 52nd Military Police Battalion in
Pristina. (Where an estimated 200,000 ethnic Albanians were rounded
up and forced into trains and buses bound for the border and
countless others have disappeared.)

NOTRE DAME PROFESSOR NEW DEAN AT BC LAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Boston College announced a new dean of its law school
Wednesday, after a long and frustrated search that began when the
former dean was forced out. The search was marked by two other
candidates falling through at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
   John H. Garvey, a professor at Notre Dame and a noted
constitutional law scholar, will take office July 1.
</P>
<P>
   A graduate of Harvard Law and Divinity Schools, Garvey has
argued many prominent cases before the US Supreme Court,
representing the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in assessing fines
against Karen Silkwood's employer, and arguing to maintain a
state's tax deduction for parents who pay parochial school tuition,
among other cases.
</P>
<P>
   Garvey has spoken extensively at conferences and law schools
around the country on constitutional freedoms, with special focus
on the difficulties faced by Catholic judges in death penalty
cases, and the problems created by paying for private school
vouchers with public school funds. He is also the author of several
constitutional law books.
</P>
<P>
   ``He and I have moral, philosophical, and religious differences,
but I just find him a remarkably open-minded, insightful kind of
person,'' said Frederick Schauer, a law professor and
constitutional law scholar who is academic dean at Harvard's
Kennedy School of Government. ``He displays a remarkable ability to
make the best arguments against his own position.''
</P>
<P>
   Schauer praised him for combining his views on his faith with
his views on the law _ a perspective, he said, that is often
missing in scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of his distinctive contributions has been trying to think
about these issues of constitutional freedoms from inside the
perspective of faith, inside the perspective of a person of
belief,'' Schauer said. ``A large number of writings about freedom
of religion tend to treat the believers as the other. With respect
to questions of belief, John is not an other.''
</P>
<P>
   BC President William P. Leahy praised Garvey for diversifying
the faculty at Notre Dame as head of the faculty appointments
committee, and for supporting student work at the intersection of
social justice and the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``John Garvey is a widely acclaimed scholar and an accomplished
teacher who cares deeply about the important role that law plays in
American society,'' Leahy said. ``We are delighted to have him join
us.''
</P>
<P>
   The dean's position has been empty since the fall of 1997, when
Aviam Soifer was forced out after disagreements with Leahy, then
the new president of BC. At the time, faculty said the
disagreements concerned relatively flat fundraising at the school.
A National Law Journal article in May 1998 suggested that Soifer,
who is Jewish, had been forced out by a ``cabal'' of priests _ a
suggestion that provoked vehement denials by professors both Jewish
and Catholic, who said they had not witnessed any anti-Semitism at
BC.
</P>
<P>
   The search was abandoned about a year ago, after two candidates
withdrew, one to assume the presidency of Grinnell College in Iowa.
The other, a minority candidate, was said to have remained at his
job in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The search resumed in August, resulting in Garvey's appointment.
</P>
<P>
   ``BC is convinced we got the very best possible candidate,''
said Jack Dunn, the BC spokesman. ``That he's Catholic isn't an
issue to us. He's clearly the best-qualified person.''
</P>
<P>
   Trouble filling the dean's chair at the law school is by no
means limited to BC. Seven law school deans were ousted from their
jobs from 1997-1998, and a quarter of the nation's 180 law schools
had vacancies in the position this year, according to the American
Bar Association. Deans cite the growing pressures of fundraising,
which has become more crucial as competition for top students and
professors has accelerated.
</P>
<P>
   Garvey has been a professor at Notre Dame, where he did his
undergraduate work, since 1994. Before that, he was a professor at
the University of Kentucky College of Law for 14 years, a visiting
professor at the University of Michigan Law School, and an
assistant to the Solicitor General at the US Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   Of BC, he said, ``It is such a great place. What legal academics
see is that it has a terrific reputation among scholars. What real
world lawyers see is that it has such a big heart. It's a place
that really takes seriously the commitment that kids ought to get
out of school and give something back to the world.''
</P>
<P>
   He was also realistic about the challenges of the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time,'' he said, ``It needs some new buildings, a
lot of money, and a lot of support.''

<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ The NATO allies opened a diplomatic
offensive Wednesday aimed at probing for signs that President
Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia might be ready to back down, and
continued to press home air attacks against Yugoslav military
targets in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   With the air campaign now in its third week, NATO officials said
foreign ministers of the 19 members would meet here on Monday to
take stock of the operation and show their determination to keep on
bombing until Milosevic accepts a political solution.
</P>
<P>
   The allies rejected Milosevic's announcement of a cease-fire in
Kosovo as ``a hollow sham,'' as the British foreign secretary,
Robin Cook, dismissively called it on Wednesday. But they also
began a flurry of diplomatic activity to see if it could just be
something more.
</P>
<P>
   The cease-fire declaration, together with a claim by the speaker
of Cyprus' Parliament that Milosevic could be ready to release
three captured American soldiers, led some allied officials to hope
the bombing campaign is beginning to erode their adversary's
morale.
</P>
<P>
   Allied warplanes took to the air 439 times between Tuesday and
Wednesday morning and bombed 28 targets throughout Yugoslavia, the
military spokesman, Air Commodore David Wilby of Britain, said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The bombers also scored what Wilby called their first major
breakthrough against Serbian armored forces that are carrying out
attacks against Albanian civilians in Kosovo, the province in
southern Serbia. Allied planes bombed a column of seven to 12
armored vehicles between Pec and the Albanian border, he said.
``Today the weather remains good,'' Wilby said, ``and this morning
we have had very encouraging results once again.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the intensified air strikes, NATO's civilian spokesman,
Jamie Shea, said the alliance is concerned by reports that the flow
of refugees across Serbian borders has stopped, and the tens of
thousands who had been backed up in Kosovo have disappeared. He
also said 50 villages in Kosovo had been set afire by Serbian
forces since Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Shea said half of the 1.8 million ethnic Albanians in Kosovo had
been driven from their homes since fighting began a little more
than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   What prompted Milosevic to say on Tuesday that he was ordering a
cease-fire was a question that many people here asked themselves.
If nothing else, Milosevic forced allied leaders to ponder yet
another set of questions. Officials here say they have no evidence
that Yugoslav and Serbian forces have actually stopped their
attacks in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that we should try to speculate what his
motivations are for calling for the cease-fire at this time,''
Secretary of Defense William Cohen told reporters flying with him
to Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe, based on what I've seen as far as the bomb damage
assessment on a daily basis, that yes, this is starting to take
hold,'' he said of the allied bombing. ``So it could be related to
the fact that he has now seen he's going to suffer considerable
pain in the coming days and weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cohen added: ``It may be that he feels he's accomplished his
mission and it's simply a charade that he's engaging in terms of,
`Well, time for peace now that I've done my job.' What we have to
do is make him understand that this is completely insufficient.''
</P>
<P>
   A French official said it was too early to conclude that
Milosevic is ready to crack. ``But the aim of the military campaign
is a political agreement, and until we get a clear answer that he
is ready for one, we have to continue the bombing,'' this official
said.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night word came from Belgrade that NATO bombs had
hit a courtyard of the headquarters of the Yugoslav army's general
staff. Many windows were blown out, but no fires were reported.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said he had no independent information about the statement
by Cyprus' acting president, Spyros Kyprianou, who has close ties
to Milosevic, that he is about to reach a deal with Belgrade about
the release of three American soldiers who were captured last week
along Serbia's border with Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to restart diplomatic cooperation with Russia on
Kosovo, officials of the United States, Britain, France, Germany
and Italy met here Wednesday with a Russian deputy foreign
minister. Diplomats said they hoped that the meeting of all six
members of the so-called Contact Group, the first since the bombing
started, would enlist Russian help in answering some of the
questions about Belgrade's intentions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is Milosevic prepared for verifiable cessation of all combat
activities and killings?'' the five western members of the group
asked in a coordinated public response to the cease-fire
announcement. ``Is Milosevic prepared to withdraw military, police
and paramilitary forces from Kosovo? Is Milosevic prepared to agree
to the deployment of an international security force? Is Milosevic
prepared to permit the unconditional return of all refugees and
unimpeded access for humanitarian aid? And, finally, is Milosevic
prepared to join in putting in place a political framework for
Kosovo on the basis of the Rambouillet accords?''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's refusal to sign an agreement worked out in March
that provides for autonomy for the ethnic Albanian population of
Kosovo under continued Serbian rule and a force of 28,000 NATO
peacekeepers brought on the allied air campaign on March 24.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing will not stop, the allies said Wednesday, until the
Yugoslav leader gives positive answers to all their questions.
``This is no time to pause,'' Cohen said. ``We will reject any
solution that freezes the results of Milosevic's genocide and
rewards his brutality.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Russia, whose leaders have urged the allies to consider
Milosevic's cease-fire proposal in a more positive light, is also
pressing diplomatic efforts of its own.
</P>
<P>
   President Boris Yeltsin sent letters to the leaders of Japan,
Canada and the five western countries in the Contact Group,
officials in Moscow said. Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said the
letters contained ``initiatives on a peaceful solution to the
conflict in Yugoslavia.'' Russia has also asked for a meeting of
foreign ministers of all eight countries to discuss the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The French Foreign Minister, Hubert Vedrine, said in Paris
Wednesday that the allies were also consulting intensively on a
strategy for seeking a political accord after the bombing stops.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is work to be done on this political solution on the
basis of the Rambouillet accord,'' he said. ``What should we adapt?
What should we keep? What form should the international security
measures take on the ground?''
</P>
<P>
   Another issue is whether, after the horrors of the past few
weeks, Milosevic is still an acceptable negotiating partner for the
allies. ``I think as each day goes by, it becomes more difficult to
arrive at a settlement with him,'' Cohen said, ``but I think that's
up to the alliance.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in the absence of a negotiated settlement, allied diplomats
say they would be ready to send peacekeepers into Kosovo even
before a Yugoslav signature on a final agreement, but only if the
Serbian forces withdraw and do not try to prevent the peacekeepers
from escorting refugees to their homes.
</P>
<P>
   And European officials say that to get Russia participate in
such an international security force, the allies might not insist
on calling it a NATO operation.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The talks Wednesday on Russia's role involved Deputy Secretary
of State Strobe Talbott, Deputy Foreign Minister Aleksandr Avdeyev
of Russia and officials of the other four Contact Group countries.
They were held at the German Embassy here, but the diplomats said
little about the talks after they ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was quite important because we are in a very
critical situation as far as developments on the ground are
concerned,'' said Gunter Pleuger, the German official who presided.
``We will continue this dialogue with the common goal of finding a
political solution to this problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The refugees seem to present the most pressing problem. Foreign
ministers of the 15-nation European Union plan to meet Thursday in
Luxembourg to decide on a proposal from the Executive Commission
for $231.5 million in relief and economic aid for the refugees and
for Albania and Macedonia, the two impoverished Balkan countries
where most of the Kosovars have fled.
</P>
<P>
   And on Friday the allies also plan to meet here with Foreign
Minister Aleksandar Dimitrov of Macedonia, whose Prime Minister on
Wednesday accused Western countries of unleashing the crisis with
the bombing and leaving countries like his to deal with the
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last 15 days after the air strikes started, Macedonia
cried out that something dramatic was going to happen,'' Prime
Minister Ljubco Georgievski said. ``The United States and European
Union have done nothing to help. We have also been forced to allow
more refugees than the limits of Macedonian acceptance.''

HOUSTON INSTITUTIONS TEAM UP TO STUDY SOCIAL FACTORS IN ILLNESS &HT;    
 &HT;

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LEIGH HOPPER 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Three academic and medical powerhouses are joining
forces to explore how social factors contribute to illness and to
develop public policies to increase wellness and productivity.
</P>
<P>
   The ambitious program, to be launched this fall, combines the
resources of Rice University, Baylor College of Medicine and the
University of Texas-Houston Health Science Center, officials
announced Wednesday. It is the first time the three have done a
major research project together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Public health people tend to think they can keep more people
from getting sick if we only control risk factors,'' said
UT-Houston Health Science Center President Dr. David Low, who
initiated the program. ``The medical people tend to think we can
help prevent people from getting sick if we control the biological
factors.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're doing is simply completing the picture, broadening
our understanding of why some people are well and some aren't by
including social, economic and environmental factors.''
</P>
<P>
   A research team led by Harvard School of Public Health professor
Alvin Tarlov will be based at Rice's James A. Baker III Institute
for Public Policy. Tarlov's position is funded by a $2 million
endowment from the Sid Richardson Foundation and distributions from
the Ray Endowment and UT-Houston, where Tarlov, who is leaving
Harvard, has accepted a professorship in the school of public
health.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Baylor College of Medicine is joining Rice to
establish an endowed chair for a scholar who will specialize in
health policy and health economics. Rice and UT-Houston will
appoint a medical sociologist and two social epidemiologists.
</P>
<P>
   ``This new effort begins with the recognition that our current
health care system is geared much too strongly to treatment of
those who are most seriously ill,'' said Rice President Malcolm
Gillis. ``Medical intervention far earlier in the process could
significantly reduce the number of people who become seriously
ill.''
</P>
<P>
   Tarlov, an internist, is a leading figure in a field known as
``social determinants of health.'' He is a professor of health
promotion and chairman of the Mind/Brain/Body/Society and Health
Initiative at Harvard. He is the former chair of University of
Chicago's department of medicine.
</P>
<P>
   He describes societal factors affecting health as those that are
``outside the skin of human beings.''
</P>
<P>
   Factors such as family structure, community, neighborhood,
workplace, income and education, as well as more abstract
influences such as a sense of fairness, a feeling of physical
security and ``the interrelationships with all living things,'' all
feed into overall health, according to Tarlov.
</P>
<P>
   He said the task in Texas will be fourfold: to understand how
all of these influences affect human health, to discover ways
cities might improve health and interventions, to propose public
and business policies that improve health, and to be a local health
improvement resource for Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Health Commissioner William ``Reyn'' Archer III applauded
the initiative _ which is similar to one he recently proposed to
state lawmakers. Legislators criticized Archer's idea to fund two
$76,000-a-year positions for researching ``root causes of social
dysfunction and marginal health status'' as too nebulous to be
funded by the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds very much like what we are trying to do,'' Archer
said. ``In the end, it's really about health and reducing the cost
of health care that we're all concerned about. Health care costs
are driving the inability of employers to provide insurance so if
we can find ways to improve health status in the community by
working on social dysfunctions, then we can reduce the cost of
health insurance and close the gap for the uninsured.''

   BLACE, Macedonia _ It was clear they had left in a hurry.
Abandoned belongings and plastic bags littered the ground. Baby
food and even identification cards were dropped in the mud.
</P>
<P>
   Overnight some 45,000 refugees were deported from the border
camp at Blace, evacuated on buses and dispersed throughout the
region. The operation, unannounced and executed by the Macedonian
authorities under the cover of darkness, was chaotic.
</P>
<P>
   Over 10,000 refugees remained unaccounted for 24 hours later, a
spokeswoman for the U.N. high commissioner for refugees said. The
organization was trying to track stories that refugees had been
sent in buses to Greece, Turkey and Albania.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are working to locate them,'' said Paula Ghedini, the
spokeswoman. ``Because it was not announced, we only found out from
other people.''
</P>
<P>
   The UNHCR has complained about the evacuation to the Macedonian
government, which has said repeatedly that it could not handle the
tens of thousands of refugees. Wednesday the Macedonian deputy
prime minister, Radmila Kiprijanova, said at a news conference than
9,500 refugees had been taken to Albania by bus and that some would
be flown to Germany.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The main bulk of the refugees, about 45,000, were dumped during
the night in new camps down the road or elsewhere in northern
Macedonia. In the chaos of the operation many families were split
up.
</P>
<P>
   After the terror of forced expulsion from Kosovo, fleeing their
homes and losing everything they own, hundreds, possibly more, lost
family members in the crush and are clamoring for news and
information.
</P>
<P>
   The camp here at Blace, for over a week home to a mass of an
estimated 65,000 people, was deserted Wednesday. The makeshift
shelters of plastic sheeting and blankets were abandoned. Nothing
moved across the hillside and fields except scraps of rubbish
blowing around. Where thousands of voices had created a constant
din, there was silence.
</P>
<P>
   The smell of thousands of unwashed bodies, crammed in close
proximity, still hung in the air. Clothes and blankets were heaped
together in a huge pile, as if people had dropped them as they
filed past to the buses. No one was crossing the border from
Serbia, and there were unconfirmed reports that the border had been
closed.
</P>
<P>
   The Macedonian authorities began loading up and busing out
refugees two days ago. For some reason they suddenly accelerated
the operation and in 24 hours cleared out over 45,000 people. They
were moved directly, bypassing the transit camps where they were to
get food, water, showers and clothing. While aid workers
interviewed here agreed that to keep the thousands at Blace would
have been impossible, they expressed concern at the methods of the
Macedonian government. They said they wanted to insure in the
future that all refugees were registered before they were moved
out.
</P>
<P>
   Some 10,000 were sent to Albania, the Macedonian government
announced Wednesday. It was not clear whether Albania, which has
been overwhelmed with more than 200,000 ethnic Albanian refugees
from Kosovo in recent weeks, had been consulted on the move.
</P>
<P>
   Another 1,500 refugees, wet mud still clogging their shoes, were
sent straight to the Skopje airport and boarded planes for Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ghedini said that she was told by aid workers that a convoy
of 20 buses crammed with refugees was observed driving as far as
the border with Greece, apparently on its way to Turkey. Greece has
offered to take 4,000 refugees and Turkey 20,000.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ghedini said there was evidence that the refugees had been
given no choice in how or where they were sent. ``We do have some
concern that some sort of pressure was used,'' she said. ``It is
not clear if they were taken forcibly, but we do know it was
involuntary. Refugees do not usually leave their possessions
behind,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   There were also numerous accounts of refugees who did not know
where they were headed and who were separated from family members
as they boarded the buses.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few miles down the road in a new tented refugee camp,
Ejup Kamerolli said he had lost two teen-age sons. ``The police
separated us as I was passing to the buses. They put the children
in the bus and made us step back. I saw them drive off but I do not
know where they went.''
</P>
<P>
   Close to tears, Kamerolli, a former policeman from northern
Kosovo, was standing with dozens of others to register lost
children at a table set up by Save the Children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not afraid they will be lost. While they are with other
Albanians they will be OK, but I just want to know where they
are,'' he said.

<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ The bombing by NATO of bridges along the
Danube in Yugoslavia has stranded scores of freighters from
Budapest, Hungary, to the Black Sea and paralyzed shipments of oil,
iron ore, soybeans and sunflower seeds to Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Though experts say the disruption will have a limited impact on
Yugoslavia itself because its trade with Western Europe is
negligible, it is likely to be painful for Hungary, Romania,
Bulgaria and Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   About 60 ships, most of them loaded with farm produce like wheat
and corn, are now stuck in Mohacs, Hungary, because they cannot get
past the bombed-out bridges to their destinations in Romania and
Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of southbound barges are also stranded. In Austria, a
leading producer of construction materials has been cut off from
its Romanian cement suppliers. Another company in Vienna, Austria,
is waiting anxiously on a bargeload of sunflower seeds, which it
uses in making oil, that has been blocked from leaving Romania.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole Danube waterway has been blocked because of the
bridges that were completely damaged in Yugoslavia,'' said Mihaly
Muller, a spokesman for the Hungarian Transportation Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrated in the ``Blue Danube'' Waltz by Johann Strauss, the
river is a major transportation link that flows 1,770 miles from
the Black Forest in southern Germany through Austria to the Balkans
and the Black Sea.
</P>
<P>
   But the attack on Yugoslavia has sliced the Danube in two,
cutting off downstream countries like Romania and Bulgaria from
their upstream markets in Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until last week, we had fairly unrestricted transit all the
way through to the Black Sea,'' said Karl Hillerer, a top manager
at Danube Shipping Co. in Passau, Germany. ``Now that has all
stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Balkan wars, Danube freight shipping has been
climbing steadily. Romania ships a wide variety of commodities,
particularly oil and iron ore. Bulgaria has built up a regular
business in ``roll on-roll off'' traffic, in which loaded trucks
are put onto ferries, carried to Austria or Germany and then driven
to their destinations. The river has also been important for
shipments of oil to the West.
</P>
<P>
   European companies are scrambling for alternative routes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an added burden that will weigh down the whole
region,'' said Gustav Poschalkote, chairman of Express
International Spedition, a shipping company in Vienna that normally
sends more than 2,000 ships a year down the river. ``It is not only
trade with Western Europe; these countries also carry out a lot of
trading with each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Shipping executives said that detours exist, but that they are
more expensive and slower. Many products can be transferred from
ships to trains, though no one is quite sure about train capacity
in Romania, and railroads are more expensive than barges. Some
could be shipped from the Black Sea through the Mediterranean and
Adriatic, but that route would be several times longer than the
Danube link.
</P>
<P>
   The disruptions have already had an impact on many companies in
Austria, long a center for business with Central European
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Lasselsberger Holdings International GmbH, a
construction-materials company based in Worth, has been importing
cement from Romania for five years. Now it has several shipments
stranded in Izmajil, near the Black Sea.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had delays time and again, but we have never come to a
complete interruption in the traffic,'' said Anton Lasselsberger,
the general manager. ``We're studying the alternatives, but we
can't say yet how much damage there might be. The big question is
how long this will last.''
</P>
<P>
   Voest-Alpine Stahl AG, a major Austrian steel manufacturer on
the river at Linz, gets much of its coal and iron ore from Central
Europe over the Danube. If deliveries become unreliable, the
company may have to depend more heavily on suppliers in other
countries. Company executives declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest disruption has been in Hungary, which has an
extensive trade with the rest of Central Europe.
</P>
<P>
   At Ferroport, one of the biggest freight-forwarding companies in
Budapest, executives predict that the city's shipping volumes will
decline by half as a result of the blockage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems that we have lost one of our legs,'' Laszlo Mester,
managing director of Ferroport, said in a telephone interview. ``We
must look for new possibilities by rail and truck. But railway
companies in the East are not prepared for this business.''

JUDGE DELAYS UTILITY'S SUIT AGAINST U.S., ORDERING SETTLEMENT
EFFORT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Minn., Nev.)   (rk) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal judge has ruled that a Minnesota utility
that is seeking $1 billion in damages from the federal government
because of a delay in establishing a nuclear waste repository must
try to reach a settlement with the Energy Department before it can
sue.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, made on Tuesday and announced Wednesday, is a blow
to the company, Northern States Power, and nine other utilities
with similar suits because such a settlement would have to be paid
from the Nuclear Waste Fund, money collected from the utilities and
set aside to construct the repository. If that fund runs short, the
department could demand more money from the utilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is essentially robbing Peter to pay Paul,'' said a lawyer
for Northern States, Michael C. Connelly.
</P>
<P>
   If the companies had been allowed to sue and won, damages could
be paid from general federal funds instead.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department signed contracts with the utilities to
bury their nuclear wastes, beginning in January 1998, in exchange
for a payment of one-tenth of a cent for each kilowatt-hour
produced by nuclear power. The department is trying to build a
repository at Yucca Mountain, Nev., near Las Vegas, but says it
cannot be ready before 2010.
</P>
<P>
   Northern States says it is running out of space for spent fuel
at its twin Prairie Island reactors, near Red Wing, Minn.
</P>
<P>
   It has built giant casks to store some wastes above ground
temporarily, but the Minnesota Legislature, resenting the extra
expense for the company's customers and fearing that the casks
could become permanent, has limited how many it can build. Northern
States expects to run out of storage by 2007.
</P>
<P>
   In his decision on Tuesday, Judge John Weise of the Court of
Federal Claims noted that ``a 12-year postponement in the
commencement of the government's promised performance would seem to
stretch the concept of `delay' to the breaking point.''
</P>
<P>
   But Weise pointed out that the contract was signed 15 years
before the Energy Department was supposed to take the waste, and
that the department is supposed to continue filling the repository
for decades, and thus ``long-time horizons are an inherent
character of the contract's design.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Anne Sullivan, the general counsel for the Energy
Department, said the decision was a precedent for the other cases
pending against the department, and suggested that if the companies
and the department reach a settlement, the department could cut
future payments by the utilities to the nuclear fund by the amount
of the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sullivan added, though, that the courts have held that three
utility companies that have already retired their reactors can seek
damages in court.
</P>
<P>
   Connelly, of Northern States, said he would appeal Weise's
decision.

WOMEN HAVE STAKE IN SOCIAL SECURITY REFORM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BRUCE RAMSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The coming reform of Social Security _ and it is coming _ is not
likely to affect everyone equally. The system already is a complex
mixture of cross-subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   Consider men and women. In most countries, women outlive men. In
the United States in 1996, for example, life expectancy at birth
was 74 for men, and 80 for women.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, any retirement plan offering the same monthly
benefits to men and women will offer higher lifetime benefits to
the average woman than the average man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women have a real stake in the Social Security debate,'' says
Rep. Barbara Kennelly, D-Conn. Kennelly, who left Congress in
January, was the ranking Democrat on the House Social Security
subcommittee and is now a counselor at the Social Security
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Men and woman pay the same 6.2 percent Social Security tax, with
another 6.2 percent contributed by their employer. But more men
than women work in the economy, and they take off less time for
their families. Women contribute only 38 percent of all Social
Security tax receipts.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, says Kennelly, ``We're 60 percent of the beneficiaries.
We've got a good deal going.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if women don't get 60 percent of the money _ it's actually
just more than half _ they get a higher rate of return on their
Social Security taxes than men do.
</P>
<P>
   Living long is one reason for that. Another is the Social
Security benefit formula, which, like the federal income tax,
favors lower incomes. Social Security's tax is regressive, because
it stops after $72,600 in earnings, but the benefit formula cancels
out that effect. The system strongly favors lower incomes. And
because women's earnings average 74 percent of men's, a greater
proportion of the average woman's salary is replaced by Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
   The system also allows the stay-at-home spouse to collect half
what the working spouse collects, even if the homemaker never paid
a penny in tax. That's a deal for women. As Kennelly says, ``How
many househusbands do you know?''
</P>
<P>
   Her conclusion is to keep Social Security much as it is.
```Let's not give up what we've got,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   There are those who would give it up for something else,
generally a system of insurance and individual accounts, often with
a guaranteed minimum. They reply first that the system mainly
favors housewives. Working women who qualify for benefits under
their husbands' taxes often find that their own taxes earned them
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Diana Furchtgott-Roth of the American Enterprise Institute,
author of the new book ``Women's Figures: An Illustrated Guide to
the Economic Progress of Women in America,'' says such women would
be much better off with individual accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they could take that tax and put it into the stock market,
they could have hundreds of thousands of dollars when they
retire,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   The reformers' major argument, though, is that the system as a
whole offers a low return on investment. Because Social Security
pays out most of the money almost as fast as it comes in, the
average American born in 1950 is earning something like a 2 percent
return. Women do better, men do worse. Big deal. It's fighting over
peanuts.
</P>
<P>
   Here we come to the half-empty, half-full debate. ``Without
Social Security,'' the agency says, ``50 percent of all
beneficiaries would fall below the poverty line.''
</P>
<P>
   That's correct. If they qualified for benefits but didn't get
them, they would be poor. But if they had invested the money in
stocks and bonds instead of paying Social Security taxes, they
might be rich.
</P>
<P>
   Today's workers won't get the option of putting 12.4 percent of
their pay into such accounts. They have to support today's
beneficiaries. Of the three plans proposed by the Advisory Council
on Social Security in 1996, the most radical would allow today's
workers to put 5 percent of their incomes, now going to tax, into
individual accounts. Even that plan would create federal deficits
for decades.
</P>
<P>
   It would, however, allow a way around the system's conundrum:
that taxes will fall short of benefits in 2014. Cutting benefits or
raising taxes are political losers. That leaves investment _ but by
government or by individuals?
</P>
<P>
   Individual accounts have a huge attraction. It's your money with
your name on it. But they are sums, not annuities. They would have
to last the average woman six years' longer than the average man.
</P>
<P>
   If saving is to be compulsory, perhaps the longer-lived gender
should be under greater compulsion. But none of the proposals I've
seen even suggests that.
</P>
<P>
   That would be discrimination.

SUPPAN FACES NEW CHALLENGE WITH ROYALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY _ Another year, another challenge for Jeff Suppan.
Could this be the year the former Red Sox righthander reaches his
potential?
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City Royals must think so, for they have put Suppan
in the rotation despite an up-and-down career that has him on his
third team in less than two years.
</P>
<P>
   Suppan wore a Boston uniform from 1993 until he was chosen by
Arizona in the 1997 expansion draft.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, after watching Suppan go 1-7 in 13 starts, the
Diamondbacks opted to drop him in favor of more consistent
veterans. Arizona signed free agents Randy Johnson and Todd
Stottlemyre this past offseason. Suppan was sold to Kansas City
last Sept. 3 and was impressive in four appearances (one start),
allowing just one run in 13 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, Suppan, No. 3 in the Royals rotation, will take
on the team with which he cut his teeth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to give him a couple of starts to see how far we
can take him,'' said Royals manager Tony Muser. ``I think it's a
good spot for him. We're taking some chances on some people and
he's one of them. We believe in his ability. But he's going to have
to back up the ability with the consistency of opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We liked him two years ago. We know he was highly thought of
by Boston. He came up and did a pretty good job. But he had a tough
time in Arizona the way he was pitching. Basically, we're trying to
get him downhill with his fastball. You can't live upstairs unless
you throw 2,000 miles an hour.''
</P>
<P>
   That Suppan is attractive to the Royals should surprise no one.
One of baseball's low-budget franchises, Kansas City has nothing to
lose. Suppan brought impressive credentials to the table in his
Boston days. Many cried foul when the Red Sox let Suppan, who
pitched 22 games for Boston escape to Arizona. But with prospects
such as Carl Pavano and Brian Rose right behind him, the Sox had to
make a decision on whom to protect for the expansion draft. They
left Suppan exposed, and he was the No. 2 pick of the Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't protect everybody,'' recalled Sox manager Jimy
Williams. ``Arizona was looking for pitching and he happened to be
there. It happens all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Suppan was openly disappointed and said he didn't understand the
system that had dictated his demise. Now he does.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter who drafts you,'' said Suppan, ``you think you'll
stay with the same team forever. I felt that way about Boston but
for me it was a quick two- or three-year experience. I've gone from
team to team. I just hope to make a name for myself here with the
Royals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today I realize that leaving the Red Sox was part of the game.
I wasn't hurt by not being protected. That's how things go
sometimes. Actually, it's been a good process for me to go
through.''
</P>
<P>
   Suppan's problems with control and location held him back in
Boston. The Diamondbacks just weren't impressed with his stuff. The
Royals think a new enviornment and a spacious park might make a
difference in his performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Command is a big part of pitching,'' said Muser. ``Also change
of speeds. If you can get your fastball to either side of the plate
and use your second pitch on even counts, you've got a chance. A
lot of guys don't have his ability.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm told there was controversy about whether to throw the
slider or curveball. People said he had a great slider at one time
and tried to go to the curveball. Maybe he got lost in between.
We're trying to get one or the other and then develop his changeup.
He's got a good one.''
</P>
<P>
   Suppan says his struggles last year with Arizona may have been a
blessing in disguise. He was sent down to Triple A and performed
well. Now he must regain command of his fastball while still being
aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did have some problems at Arizona,'' he said, ``and I
understand why they sent me down last year. But once there, I
started to iron things out. I finally felt like I was back where I
should be. The rumors started after that and I came over here and
played in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way the game is today only a few pitchers can step up and
have instant success. Kerry Wood has overpowering stuff and made it
until he got hurt. Guys like myself have to go down the middle of
the road. You struggle. You have some good games, bad games. I'm
more aggressive. I have a little better idea of what I can do out
there. Hopefully, it will help me for this season.''
</P>
<P>
   Muser said the Royals can't hope to develop a talent like Suppan
overnight. So until they do, he's worth a look.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's tough,'' he said. ``But today's kids are learning
on the major league level. We're moving them so fast and getting
them here very quickly. That's not always good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because they might have a major league arm, we move them
without insisting they have substantial success on the minor league
level. Many times, they're able to get by the many divisions of
baseball and make the big leagues without really learning those
things that get you by at the highest levels. Now we have to teach
those things.''

 &HT;    No. 2 Austin school official put on leave amid test tampering
indictment
 &HT;    By Sharon Jayson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Kay Psencik, the Austin school district's deputy
superintendent charged with tampering with state achievement test
data, was placed on administrative leave with pay Wednesday until
further notice.
</P>
<P>
   Psencik worked Wednesday, but late in the day interim
Superintendent A.C. Gonzalez issued the statement regarding her
leave and named Darlene Westbrook as acting deputy superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will continue to seek legal counsel regarding this personnel
issue, as well as the criminal indictment against the School
District, (cq-caps)'' Gonzalez said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
   Psencik and the school district were indicted Tuesday by a
Travis County grand jury on charges of tampering with governmental
record (cq-no ``a'' before governmental). The criminal
investigation, which has drawn national attention, focused on
changes made to 16 student identification numbers on the Texas
Assessment of Academic Skills. The test is at the heart of the
state's school accountability system. As a result, Blackshear,
Bryker Woods and Travis Heights elementary schools received higher
performance ratings than they deserved. The Texas Education Agency
later lowered those ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Psencik, 51, announced her retirement in February, effective at
the end of the school year. She earns $124,200 plus expenses. She
has denied wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Psencik, former district research analyst Ricky Arredondo and
four principals, including the campus leaders at the three
elementary schools, were disciplined by the superintendent for
their part in the TAAS data manipulation. Arredondo, who reported
to Psencik, pleaded no contest to the same tampering charge March
25.
</P>
<P>
   County Attorney Ken Oden said Wednesday that there was not
sufficient evidence to charge the principals. An audit said the
principals were asked to gather data that the district used to keep
some TAAS tests from being included in the accountability ratings.
</P>
<P>
   The tampering offense is a Class A misdemeanor subject to up to
a year in jail and a $4,000 fine. The district, which is liable for
a maximum fine of $10,000 for each of 16 indictments, one for each
student whose identification number was swapped, could face fines
of up to $160,000.
</P>
<P>
   Oden said he doubts the district will pay any fines. He said his
goal in holding the district accountable was to ensure that the
district gives extra TAAS help to students who need it, rather than
hide poor school performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal was to remedy a wrong,'' Oden said. ``What I'm out
for is a meaningful remedy for the schools damaged and meaningful
provisions for real help in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   In charging the district as a whole, Oden said the legal
definition of ``association'' includes ``government or governmental
subdivision,'' which is how the school district is defined in this
matter. He said his office looked at all the options under the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it became clear that a true organizational remedy couldn't
be obtained without organizational responsibility,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Austin school district may be the first school district in
the country to be indicted on criminal charges, said Julie
Underwood, general counsel for the National School Boards
Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``It probably served quite well to draw attention to a problem.
It does serve that purpose, but I question whether it will stick,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Austin school trustees will meet next week with attorneys about
the case _ during the same week of community meetings on the search
for a permanent superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   Trustee Ted Whatley said he doesn't think the indictments will
hurt the search.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it probably clears the air,'' he said. ``I think
people have been waiting to see what would happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Board President Kathy Rider said with or without an indictment,
the district has to restore the integrity of the central office.
``We already had integrity problems,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   David Justice, a Johnston High parent, said the indictments may
help in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will be good, a wake-up call,'' he said. ``It's the
same old problem. People have good intentions setting up the
testing system. What happens is as time goes on people lose sight
of what the fundamentals of the law are.''
</P>
<P>
   Brenda Urps, president of the Austin Association of Teachers,
agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that really needs to be looked at,'' she said.
``Maybe this is an eye-opener. It shows the pressure is really
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas Education Commissioner Mike Moses said Wednesday the
indictment of a Texas school district emphasizes to him how some
school districts have gotten ``off course'' over the statewide
accountability system. ``This whole situation has certainly made me
reflect on what we can do at the agency and I can do as
commissioner to set the proper tone and set the right climate for
assessment and accountability,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Moses asked 11 school districts to investigate
excessive TAAS erasures at some campuses. Houston's investigation
has resulted in personnel changes at some campuses. Dallas has
asked for more time to investigate. Of the remaining districts,
three found some irregularities, said Debbie Graves Ratcliffe, a
TEA spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   The county attorney's office also is investigating the Austin
district for data manipulation in other areas, including dropout
data.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, a legislative committee will consider a measure by
State Rep. Domingo Garcia (D-Dallas) that would make altering
student records a felony.
</P>
<P>
   ``I firmly believe the indictments will give more impetus to my
bill and what happened in Houston and what's happening in Dallas
all indicate it's a major problem and it's time we deal with it in
this legislative session,'' Garcia said.

 &HT;    Chick-fil-A stores in S. Africa aim to profit, offer aid
 &HT;    By Don Melvin
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANDTON, South Africa _ For Dan Cathy, as for his father,
Chick-fil-A founder S. Truett Cathy, doing business is as much
about helping people as it is about making money.
</P>
<P>
   That's fortunate, because the Atlanta-based fast food chain is
finding that the economic climate in South Africa poses significant
challenges, including interest rates in the high teens and an
economy that shrank in the last quarter of last year.
</P>
<P>
   But there's no denying that, in a country where unemployment is
estimated at nearly 40 percent, Chick-fil-A, by opening stores, is
helping people.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Chick-fil-A opened a store in Durban. In 1997, it
opened a store in the East Gate shopping center on the southeast
edge of Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
   Today, as mall management and local officials gather for a
celebration, the chain will open its third store in South Africa,
this time in a mall in Sandton, an upscale northern suburb of
Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
   While the volume in the first two stores has not yet lived up to
expectations, the new store will give more than two dozen South
Africans, most of whom were previously unemployed, regular jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got 25, 30 people that we took off the street,'' said
Cathy, who is president of Chick-fil-A International and executive
vice president of the chain. ``It may be a candle in the night, but
at least it's still glimmering.''
</P>
<P>
   Between the three stores, about 100 people are now employed,
said Danie van den Heever, one of Chick-fil-A's South African
partners. On a continent where each wage-earner often feeds five or
six people, about 500 lives may have been improved, he said.
</P>
<P>
   And those employees are learning skills, such as dealing with
the public and managing others, that will serve them in good stead,
van den Heever said.
</P>
<P>
   It costs about $350,000 to open a store in a mall, Cathy said,
and that is being divided between the chain, a silent partner and
van den Heever.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when many whites are leaving South Africa, van den
Heever is investing in it instead. It was a decision the
eighth-generation African made with his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sat round the table and we made a decision: What does God
want for us in the next 10 years? If we're going to stay here,
we're going to be part of the solution,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Cathy doesn't want to make money. He hopes interest
rates go down, so the stores can keep their prices low enough to do
the volume they need to do, and he hopes unemployment drops, so
more people can afford chicken sandwiches.
</P>
<P>
   ``If all those people were employed, they'd be coming in and
eating with us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Chick-fil-A decided to do business in South Africa shortly after
Cathy visited the country as part of a trade mission led by Atlanta
Mayor Bill Campbell in 1995. Company officials also took to heart
the recommendation of Donald Keough, then president of the
Coca-Cola Co., who said South Africa was fertile ground because so
many American fast food chains had stayed out of the country during
the apartheid years.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa's chicken wars may soon heat up. Kentucky Fried
Chicken, which caters more to the dinner market than lunch, has a
number of stores in South Africa. And Atlanta-based AFC Enterprises
has opened one store in Durban and plans to open one in the
Johannesburg area this year.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa is the only foreign country in which Chick-fil-A
currently does business, and the company is proceeding cautiously,
Cathy said. But the low initial volume reminds him of times when
Chick-fil-A entered new U.S. markets.
</P>
<P>
   There are no billboards with cows holding ``EAT MOR CHIKIN''
signs. The brand is not yet known.
</P>
<P>
   But Chick-fil-A is working at it, distributing free sandwiches
to mall employees in hopes of giving them the chicken sandwich
habit. Then, Cathy said, those employees may recommend the store,
or leave Chick-fil-A cups sitting around, and the word will get
out. ``This is hand-to-hand combat,'' he said. ``This is guerrilla
marketing.

YUGOSLAVIA CLOSES MAJOR EXITS FROM KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Budgeted as Yugoslavia-Soldiers)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Yugoslavia sealed off Kosovo's main border
crossings Wednesday, forcing tens of thousands of ethnic Albanians
back toward the burned villages they had been fleeing.
</P>
<P>
   US officials decried the move as a cruel attempt by Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic to give the appearance that the crisis
is over, even as NATO kept bombing the country.
</P>
<P>
   After forcing more than 400,000 refugees out to neighboring
countries, Yugoslav authorities closed the main exit routes into
Albania and Macedonia, apparently telling Kosovo refugees it was
safe for them to go home because of a unilateral cease-fire
declared Tuesday by Yugoslavia for Orothodox Easter.
</P>
<P>
   While NATO bomb blasts were heard again Wednesday night in
Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital, the acting president of Cyprus was
waiting in Athens for clearance to enter Belgrade, where he plans
to travel Thursday to seek the release of three US soliders
captured by the Serbs a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   In other developments Wednesday:
</P>
<P>
   --An unmanned US Army reconnaissance plane was downed over
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   --The US government named nine Serb commanders who could face
prosecution for war crimes.
</P>
<P>
   --Diplomatic efforts continued to try and resolve the Kosovo
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   --NATO announced its first major breakthrough against Serb
ground forces in what it called its heaviest daylong attack to
date.
</P>
<P>
   As Yugoslavia closed its borders, pushing upward of 10,000
ethnic Albanians into the interior of Kosovo province, according to
one US official, German Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping warned
that the Yugoslavs might be planning to use the civilians who were
turned back into Kosovo as ``human shields'' against NATO attacks.
</P>
<P>
   A National Security Council official, who spoke on the condition
of anonmity, said the border closings ``could well be part of
Milosevic's peace offensive. He's trying in a tragically
manipulative way to say to the Kosovo people, `the crisis is over,
you can go home now.'''
</P>
<P>
   While Kosovo's borders were being closed, Macedonia, which has
been criticized for the squalid conditions at its makeshift camp,
shipped 10,000 refugees to Albania and moved 25,000 to NATO tent
camps farther away toward the Macedonian capital of Skopje.
</P>
<P>
   On a separate front, the United States accused nine commanders
of Yugoslav military units operating in Kosovo of committing war
crimes and warned that the perpetrators would face international
justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are naming these commanders because they ought to know that
their forces, in our view, are commiting war crimes and crimes
against humanity,'' said James P. Rubin, a spokesman for the State
Department.
</P>
<P>
   He said the United States wanted the military officials to know
``the world is watching and that the war crimes tribunal is there,
and we are going to assist them in this process.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said it was up to the International War Crimes Tribunal
whether to indict anyone suspected of wartime atrocities, but the
United States would be providing detailed information and names.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement was an apparent effort to stoke division among
Belgrade's military and security forces at a time the
administration believes it is seeing some positive results from 15
days of NATO airstrikes on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said the US warning was issued Wednesday because ``we have
every reason to believe that in the coming days, terrible things''
could happen in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Cypriot leader Spyros Kyprianou waited for the green
light to enter Yugoslavia to seek the release of the three solders
captured a week ago while patrolling the Yugoslav-Macedonian
border.
</P>
<P>
   US officials said they hope he succeeds, but they vowed that
NATO airstrikes would continue regardless of the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   A top Clinton administration official told the Globe Wednesday
that Milosevic's apparent willingess to consider freeing the
soldiers falls in the same category as his cease-fire proposal and
was another sign that NATO's bombing campaign was hurting the
Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like they are trying to bargain,'' the official said.
``We are not going to let there be a backdoor approach to
negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   Samuel R. ``Sandy'' Berger, the national security adviser, was
cautious about the mission but said, ``We certainly would welcome
the release of the three American soldiers.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, addressing the Kosovo crisis during a speech
on US-China relations, said, ``It is not enough for Mr. Milosevic
to say that his forces will cease fire in a Kosovo denied its
freedom and devoid of its people.
</P>
<P>
   ``He must withdraw his forces, let the refugees return, permit
the deployment of an international security force,'' Clinton said.
``Nothing less will bring peace with security to the people of
Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, NATO said it had launched its heaviest air raids to
date, hitting an armored column in southwestern Kosovo on Tuesday
in its `first major breakthrough'' against Yugoslav ground forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear that NATO forces are beginning to inflict
increasing damage on Yugoslav forces,'' Defense Secretary William
Cohen said in Brussels, where he is meeting with NATO leaders.
``This is no time to pause.''
</P>
<P>
   Air Force Major General Charles Wald, vice director for
strategic plans and policy for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the
low- and slow-flying ``tank killer'' A-10 aircraft hit Serb forces
in Kosovo overnight Tuesday, the first time the planes, nicknamed
Warthogs, struck enemy targets in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Later Wednesday, an unmanned Army reconnaissance aircraft _ a
twin-engine plane, known as a Hunter, crashed after apparently
being shot down.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials said Albania's parliament approved NATO plans to
send in 24 US Apache attack helicopters _ a move that should
bolster the alliance's firepower against Yugoslav tanks and armor.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the air war continued, there was movement on the various
diplomatic fronts.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, a traditional ally of Yugoslavia, stepped up its search
for a political agreement over Kosovo, with President Boris Yeltsin
urging world leaders not to dismiss Belgrade's latest unilateral
proposals out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin said Yeltsin sent a letter to the leaders of the
Group of Seven _ the United States, Britain, Canada, France,
Germany, Italy, and Japan _ that spelled out Milosevic's ideas and
asked the countries to be constructive.
</P>
<P>
   US officials said they welcomed Yeltsin's efforts with
Milosevic. ``The Russians have been part and parcel of our effort
to try to find a peaceful solution to the problems in Yugoslavia
from the beginning,'' said Rubin from the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   On a separate front, the Canadian government, in a major shift
in position, said it was considering the possibility of using NATO
ground troops in Kosovo, even without a peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Canada and ground troops, Wald of the Joint Chiefs
said: ``Any prudent military planner probably would plan, not only
in this case but any case, for all possibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added. ``On the policy side, our intention is not to put
any ground troops in, period.''

 By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One of the oldest frauds on Wall Street has been
updated for the Internet age.
</P>
<P>
   Using a personal web site intended to look like an Internet page
of Bloomberg News, someone posted a fake news story early Wednesday
that said an American technology company called PairGain
Technologies Inc. was being taken over by an Israeli rival for a
hefty price. The report spread to a Yahoo message board and then to
other sites frequented by stock traders, who quickly bid up
PairGain's stock by more than 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   By midday, the stock retreated as the takeover story was
debunked, but it finished the day as the 12th-most heavily traded
on Nasdaq, ahead of such popular shares as Amazon.com and E-trade.
</P>
<P>
   The hoax, which is already under investigation by the Securities
and Exchange Commission and the Nasdaq Stock Market, shows the
startling power of Internet chat rooms and day traders, who make
rapid-fire trades in and out of relatively small stocks in which
they can easily move the price.
</P>
<P>
   Investors who were duped into buying shares at the temporarily
inflated price have suffered at least paper losses, though it could
be weeks before regulators are able to sort out who was trading.
</P>
<P>
   Bloomberg said the report was not from one of its reporters, and
the prankster had not been identified last night. PairGain, a
Tustin, Calif., maker of telecommunications equipment, and its
alleged suitor, ECI Telecom Ltd., denied that they were in merger
talks.
</P>
<P>
   False rumors about a company have percolated as long as there
have been markets, and prank announcements of takeovers have
occured during times of intense interest in the stock market, like
the late 1980s, when corporate raiders garnered headlines. But
market analysts said that the false PairGain story, which made
generous use of the scrolling text, web links and icons so familiar
to Internet users, is one of the most technologically sophisticated
examples of such fraud in years.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Elgindy, an online stock trader who operates a stock
service called Pacific Equity Investigations, called the fake
report ``incredibly believable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was detailed enough _ with quotations and remarks and
attributions _ that it reads as if it came from a press release
that the company wrote,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The fraud was well orchestrated. The posting appeared on the
Internet just a half hour before trading began on the Nasdaq
market, leaving little time for anyone to check with the companies
but enough for investors to place orders to buy shares.
</P>
<P>
   It started at 8:55 a.m. ET, on a page of Angelfire.com, a web
site operated by Lycos Inc., which allows individuals to create
their own web pages containing personal or business information.
The story first appeared not on a message board or in a chat room,
but on a personal page that could have been created by any
registered Angelfire user. The news story carried the Bloomberg.com
logo and announced that ECI had agreed to buy PairGain for $1.35
billion in cash, twice the company's market value just a day
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   How the news traveled to broader investment circles on the
Internet is not yet clear. But roughly a half hour later, a
reference to the Angelfire posting and a link to the page appeared
on a Yahoo message board devoted to investment topics, which was
quickly followed by postings on other Internet sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wahooooo!!! I knew this day would come!,'' wrote one
enthusiastic investor on the Yahoo message board for PairGain,
minutes after word of the ``takeover'' appeared. Another calculated
a takeover price of $19 a share, quite a jump from PairGain's $8.50
closing price the previous day. A third noted that PairGain's
products, which allow for high-speed transmission of data over
traditional copper wires, ``Will `pair' well'' with ECI's products
for digital communications.
</P>
<P>
   Once stock trading began, PairGain shares rose sharply on heavy
volume, peaking at $11.125. At the end of Wednesday, PairGain was
priced at $9.375, up 10 percent from $8.50 on Tuesday. And 13.69
million shares changed hands in one day, roughly 13 times its
average daily volume.
</P>
<P>
   The stock began to retreat as Internet investors began to
question the veracity of the takeover report and fell further after
PairGain and ECI denied that they had reached a deal or were even
in talks.
</P>
<P>
   The fake announcement seemed to confirm what had been rumored
for months. Charles McBrayer, the chief financial officerof
PairGain, said that the same or similar rumors have cropped up four
times in the past year. In addition, two Israeli newspapers
reported last month that ECI was in talks to acquire an American
technology company, possibly PairGain. ``On the one hand, the
Internet should be helpful to individual investors,'' McBrayer
said. ``But in this case, the fakery was done so well that it
looked little different than if the news came from a legitimate
source.''
</P>
<P>
   Signs of fraud, however, were picked up by Baker Street
Irregulars who scan many of the online chat rooms for signs of
misbegotten investment hype. By shortly after 10 a.m., one Yahoo
participant noted that the web page announcing the takeover was not
in fact part of Bloomberg's larger web site, and the real Bloomberg
site had no indication of the news. Another chipped in that
PairGain's investor relations phone number in California did not
mention there would be a major news announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Securities and Exchange Commission and the
Nasdaq market declined to comment on whether they were
investigating the hoax; as a practice, they rarely comment on
investgations. But McBrayer said he had talked with officials from
the SEC's Internet Fraud division, as well as the market
surveillance staff of the Nasdaq market, both of which were looking
into the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Payea, a spokesman for Lycos, which operates the Angelfire
web site, said the company had not yet been contacted by
regulators. He declined to indentify the individual who created the
fake web site, saying it was company policy not to release
information on members unless compelled by legal authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Angelfire said it removed the posting early Wednesday afternoon
after it was contacted by Bloomberg's lawyers. Chris Taylor, a
Bloomberg spokeswoman, said the news service's own computers were
not involved in the hoax.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Virtually anyone with Internet access can save the image from a
particular web page and then, using that template, insert their own
text to create an authentic looking but fraudulent web page. In
fact, said Payea, Angelfire removes from its site several pages a
day of users who have co-opted the copyrighted material of other
sites and drawn the ire of the material's owners.
</P>
<P>
   The relative ease with which computer users can create
sophisticated web sites has contributed to the Internet power and
attractiveness, in much the same way that the personal computer and
laser printers gave small publishing operations the ability to
produce slick documents that look professionally typeset.
</P>
<P>
   But in many ways, the investment hoax was an old tale in a new
guise. In recent years, the financial markets and news services
have been occasionally duped by false reports that seemed
authentic.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, a caller to the Nasdaq market's market surveillance
unit identified himself as the chief financial officer of Sybase
Inc. and asked that the company's stock be halted for a pending
news announcement. Trading was halted for more than a half hour
before Nasdaq officials determined the call was a hoax.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, the stocks of NWA, parent of Northwest Airlines, and
Pan Am were halted in trading on the New York Stock Exchange after
the Reuters news service reported on a fake takeover bid for both
companies. And in 1987, a financial adviser from a prominant
Cincinnati family called the Dow Jones News Service and announced a
takeover bid for Dayton Hudson, the Midwestern retailer, which the
news service reported. The bid was later determined to be a hoax,
and securities regulators brought charges of fraud against the
adviser, in 1989 barring him from the securities business.

 &HT;    Barr, Isakson lead anti-tax rally
 &HT;    By Henry Farber
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ About 50 supporters gathered on the Marietta Square on
Wednesday at an anti-tax rally hosted by Republican U.S. Reps. Bob
Barr and Johnny Isakson, who were pushing a constitutional
amendment to make tax increases harder to pass.
</P>
<P>
   Barr is attempting to build steam for a House vote on April 15
to refer the amendment to the 50 states. If ratified, federal taxes
could not be raised without approval by a two-thirds margin in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Now, taxes can be raised by simple majorities. ``The power to
tax is the most fundamental power that the government has,'' Barr
said. ``It's far too much power now.''
</P>
<P>
   The main speaker was U.S. Rep. Joe Barton (R-Texas). ``We don't
say it should be impossible to raise taxes, but it should take a
super majority,'' Barton said. ``Two-thirds makes sure that it's a
big issue and the country's behind it.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters in the crowd included Christina Jeffrey, who opposed
Isakson in the race to fill former House Speaker Newt Gingrich's
seat; Paul Ploener, leader of Concerned Taxpayers in Cobb County;
and Bob Terrell, Georgia chairman of Citizens for an Alternative
Tax System.
</P>
<P>
   Since the impeachment of President Clinton, taxes have become a
national Republican focus. ``I wish he'd push the national sales
tax as hard as he does impeachment,'' Terrell said of Barr.
</P>
<P>
   Barr responded that he is not yet ready to commit to a national
levy on sales. He said either a sales tax or flat tax would be
preferable to the current system.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ NATO has rejected Slobodan Milosevic's
latest move, a unilateral cease-fire, as insufficient for the
bombing to stop, but once again it is the Yugoslav president who is
creating the facts to which the West is responding.
</P>
<P>
   And Milosevic appears to be constructing a new form of reality
in Kosovo that will be harder for the Washington and NATO to
dismiss out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav government is essentially declaring that the crisis
is over, the Kosovo Liberation Army is vanquished, and negotiations
for an internal solution are taking place with acceptable ethnic
Albanian leaders, and as a result there is no reason, except NATO's
bombs, for refugees not to return home.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic is talking peace, urging (or forcing) refugees to
return to Kosovo and dangling the possibility of releasing three
captured American soldiers as a good-will gesture. At the same time
he continues to ratchet up the pressure on neighboring Macedonia
and sister republic Montenegro, giving the West another incentive
to stop further Balkan chaos.
</P>
<P>
   However disingenuous, cynical or even malevolent this may seem
to Western policymakers, there is enough reality in the Yugoslav
version to further divide the alliance and the six-nation Contact
Group, which includes the United States, Western European countries
and Russia, and whose task it is to deal with Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians in particular are urging NATO to consider
Milosevic's plan as a serious way to restart negotiations, at
least, and it is not easy for Washington to follow its usual
pattern and brush the weak Russians off.
</P>
<P>
   American officials have indicated that Washington is seeking
Moscow's help to find an acceptable diplomatic end to the air
campaign before NATO's 50th summit meeting three weeks from now in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Reliable information from Kosovo is almost nonexistent in
Belgrade, even as the first carefully guided reporters were bused
by the army on Wednesday into Pristina, the capital of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But the Yugoslav military and police seem to have accomplished
many of their aims on the ground in Kosovo without being too badly
mauled by NATO air power.
</P>
<P>
   Milan Bozic, minister without portfolio in the Yugoslav
government, said: ``We're offering a unilateral cease-fire in
Kosovo because we believe that the terrorists who used the NATO
bombings to put pressure on our country are now virtually
destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   His claims may be exaggerated, but the KLA has been routed and
has proven no match for Serbian armored might, even with NATO air
power in support. While the Serbs are not likely to eradicate the
KLA guerrillas, Yugoslav officials privately admit, they make the
point that the KLA is not like the well-trained and traditionally
organized Croatian army, which only needed NATO air support to see
off a demoralized Serb army in Bosnia in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``The KLA, unlike the Croats, cannot serve as NATO's ground
troops in Kosovo,'' said one Foreign Ministry official. Without
ground troops, he said, and with the KLA in retreat, ``there is no
reason for Serb forces to leave Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   The cease-fire may be a sign that Milosevic is ``rattled,'' as
the Pentagon spokesman, Kenneth H. Bacon, has said. But it is more
likely to have been a ploy to discomfit the Contact Group and
affect public opinion in Russia, Greece and Italy, the countries
that have displayed the most unease about the bombing. It is almost
inconceivable that Milosevic expected the West to follow his lead
and declare a pause in the bombing _ every Western leader had
stated publicly that NATO would ignore a unilateral Easter
cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic is following similar tactics with the three captured
American soldiers, not only using their possible release as a way
to look like a peacemaker, but also to underline Yugoslavia's
position that the conflict is _ or should be _ over, and that talks
should begin.
</P>
<P>
   In the interim, it is clear that Milosevic will try to create
his own internal political settlement for wide political autonomy
for Kosovo that will look very much like the Western-drafted peace
plan of Rambouillet, but without the introduction of NATO forces,
an element he has consistently rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic and senior Serbian officials have met with the ethnic
Albanian leader, Ibrahim Rugova, who has long advocated a
nonviolent path to real political autonomy and, ultimately,
independence. Rugova was regarded by Washington as the most
important Kosovar leader until the emergence of the Kosovar
Liberation Army as a military and political player about a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   As Rugova's influence declined, Yugoslav officials argue,
Washington switched its support to the armed insurgents of the KLA,
while continuing to insist that an independent Kosovo was not an
American goal. Rugova was part of the ethnic Albanian delegation
that signed the Rambouillet peace accords.
</P>
<P>
   NATO and American officials have consistently questioned
Rugova's current freedom of movement and speech. But Russian
officials who have spoken or met with him, including Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov and Yuri Kotov, Moscow's ambassador to
Belgrade, insist that Rugova is free to act.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Even if Rugova is not a free agent, Milosevic may simply be
using him _ as he is using the refugees _ to pressure the West into
more serious negotiations, which would have to be predicated on a
mutual cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   Rugova's apparent willingness to find an internal solution for
Kosovo, if only to save lives, has been one more nail in the coffin
of the Rambouillet plan, at least that part that envisioned a NATO
peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   Even the chief European Union negotiator at Rambouillet,
Wolfgang Petritsch of Austria, was quoted on Wednesday by InfoRadio
Berlin as saying: ``We know that both sides no longer recognize
Rambouillet as a basis. Both the Yugoslav and the Kosovo Albanian
side are of the opinion that Rambouillet is dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, French and Italian officials are talking about the
need to revise Rambouillet, and even NATO's current demands on
Milosevic to answer, as announced on Wednesday by member nations,
suggest a step back from the demands that set off this bombing war
two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Those questions were summarized on Wednesday by President
Clinton, who said: ``It is not enough now for Mr. Milosevic to say
that his forces will cease-fire on a Kosovo denied its freedom and
devoid of its people. He must withdraw his forces, let the refugees
return, permit the deployment of an international security force.
Nothing less will bring peace with security to the people of
Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   The reference to an international force instead of a NATO force
was a small but significant shift. In a little-noted resolution of
the Serbian Parliament just before the bombing, when that hardly
independent body rejected NATO troops in Kosovo, it also supported
the idea of U.N. forces to monitor a political settlement there.
</P>
<P>
   And NATO said that Milosevic must ``withdraw military, police
and paramilitary forces from Kosovo,'' not necessarily withdraw all
his forces.
</P>
<P>
   So the two sides seem to be getting closer, even as the
war-inspired language continues to steam, with both sides accusing
the other of Nazilike tactics.
</P>
<P>
   But diplomacy could also continue to fail. As a fallback
position, said one Yugoslav analyst considered close to the regime,
who spoke on the condition of anonymity, Milosevic may be willing
to endure a NATO ground invasion, on the assumption that his forces
can inflict more casualties than Washington could bear, and then
agree to a partition of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But Belgrade authorities believe, this analyst said, that it
will be difficult for NATO to put forces on the ground if Kosovo
appears, at least, to be pacified, with a form of political
autonomy and the return of a reasonable number of refugees.

<P>
   Trade officials from the United States and China are scrounging
for a deal that would allow President Clinton and Prime Minister
Zhu Rongji to announce Thursday that the two countries have come to
agreement on China's application to join the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   If the issue were narrowly about trade and economics, the two
sides would probably have little trouble shaking hands.
</P>
<P>
   China, one of the world's major trading powers, wants membership
in the organization that sets and adjudicates the rules. The
Clinton administration thinks that is just fine _ as long as China
agrees to open its borders widely to imports and foreign investors.
There is plenty of economic room for a deal.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton and Zhu are hemmed in by politics. The president
must look over his shoulders at the Republicans who want no accord
at all and the Democrats who want the deal to satisfy every one of
their constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu faces domestic problems from those within the Communist
Party who are not enthusiastic about market reforms and from
managers and workers in protected sectors who risk losing their
jobs. The problem is that neither side appears to know exactly
where the other side's bottom line lies.
</P>
<P>
   What is known is that China wants to ensure that its critical
textile and apparel industries are not discriminated against as
global quotas are relaxed.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, it is looking for enough time to conform to
international trading rules so that its authoritarian leaders can
minimize internal disruption and resistance.
</P>
<P>
   The United States wants to quickly knock down dozens of barriers
that keep American goods, services and investors out of China's
potentially vast markets. But beyond the generalities are layers of
confusing and contradictory forces.
</P>
<P>
   Take the argument by some Republicans leaders, from Gary Bauer,
a presidential hopeful, to Sen. Jesse Helms R-N.C., that China
should not be awarded entrance into the world's trading community
in the wake of human rights violations, accusations of nuclear
espionage, illegal campaign contributions to Clinton and burgeoning
trade surpluses. But to many economists, this argument makes little
sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big winner is the United States _ or at least American
corporations. The United States has few carrots to offer the
Chinese to sign a deal,'' says Nicholas Lardy of the Brookings
Institution in Washington. ``The economic benefits of WTO
membership for China are relatively meager.''
</P>
<P>
   Lardy's point is that American markets are already essentially
open to China. So are every other country's. China gains little by
entering the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   But many of China's markets are closed. High tariffs, bans on
agricultural imports, rules that shut out foreign firms and
restrict foreign investors, loose enforcement of copyright
protections and regulations that prevent foreign companies from
selling goods directly to Chinese customers combine to keep
American exports low. Last year, China ran a huge trade surplus
with the United States of nearly $60 billion, only slightly behind
Japan's.
</P>
<P>
   Though bilateral trade deficits are economically benign,
economists say, they are politically incendiary. One way for
Clinton to chip away at the trade deficit with China is to make
China friendlier to American exports.
</P>
<P>
   It is important to keep the economic argument in perspective.
Extra trade with China will not do much for the average American.
Even trade worth more than $85 billion a year between the United
States and China is simply too small _ little more than 1 percent _
to make much of a dent in an $8 trillion American economy one way
or the other.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's chief trade official, Charlene Barshefsky, has
spent years negotiating on behalf of excluded insurance,
pharmaceutical, farm and telecommunications interests. Hard
bargaining could do wonders for specific companies, even certain
sectors, but not for the economy as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   The other payoff for the United States is political. The trade
organization, whose fair-trade rules disproportionately help
American exporters, will suffer without the cooperation of China,
already one of the largest trading countries. The United States
would be better off if China were inside the World Trade
Organization tent rather than disrupting it from the outside.
</P>
<P>
   For the United States, the main drawback would be that it could
no longer easily impose unilateral sanctions for China's sins. In
most instances, the United States would be obligated to first bring
its complaint before an international judicial panel. But that is
not much of a burden: those panels have provided effective relief
so far in every case where Washington has brought valid complaints.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats will oppose China's formal entry into the global
trading regime for the same protectionist reasons they opposed a
free-trade agreement with Mexico. Yet the argument that trade with
low-wage countries hurts American workers was weak when applied to
Mexico _ the U.S.' second-largest export market after Canada _ and
weaker still when applied to a distant, less pervasive trade
partner. The data show, says Lardy, that imports from China come
largely at the expense of other Asian exporters.
</P>
<P>
   China's benefits from membership are more distant. The Chinese
are among the world's lowest-cost producers of textiles. But their
exports are limited by quotas imposed by the United States and many
other countries. These quotas will, by international agreement, be
phased out within the next few years under rules that will be set
by the World Trade Organization. China knows it can best protect
its interest if is part of the organization that will draw up the
rules.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, the big payoff of membership may well be to
consolidate China's move to the market and thereby cement Zhu's
position within the Chinese political establishment. Professor
Barry Naughton of the University of California at San Diego says
that it is ``absolutely clear that Zhu is driving toward markets.''
</P>
<P>
   As proof, he cites Zhu's willingness to see one of seven workers
in state-owned factories thrown off his job to close worthless
state-owned enterprises. Moreover, nearly all goods in China are
now traded in markets free of price controls.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows what economic model Zhu has in mind. It might
include a heavy government hand, as in South Korea. It might
include large government-run sectors in transportation and health.
``Yet Zhu's overall direction is clear,'' Naughton said. ``An
international accord that locks China into market-opening reforms
may make it easier for Zhu to fend off attempts to slide back into
government planning.''
</P>
<P>
   Though economists are mostly enthusiastic about China's entry
into the World Trade Organization, they flag possible pitfalls.
``There is danger in demanding too much from China,'' said Dwight
Perkins, a professor at Harvard. ``A country with half of its
population in agriculture cannot be expected to open up its food
markets entirely. A banking system loaded down with bad loans to
state-owned factories may not survive vigorous competition from
foreign banks.''
</P>
<P>
   Perkins is convinced that China's membership in the trade group
makes sense for both sides. But he wants the deal to give Chinese
banks and agriculture time to adjust. That means, he says, phasing
in market reforms over five or more years, though there ought to be
strict deadlines for every market-opening measure, so that China
cannot dither.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Mastel of the Economic Strategy Institute, while agreeing
that Beijing should be joining the trade group, worries that the
China lacks the discipline of markets or legally enforced rules.
</P>
<P>
   He points to Chinese violations of the trade accord it struck
with the Bush administration. China, he says, did not live up to
promises to open up government contracts to foreigners or abandon
import licenses and other trade restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If China does not obey the rules once it is inside the tent,''
Mastel warns, ``the credibility of the tent is at risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Mastel thinks that World Trade Organization panels might be
largely ineffective in monitoring economic practices in China's
closed society because they lack the power to compel the
presentation of documents. He wants the deal to include a safeguard
provision that would allow the United States to withdraw
unilaterally if it deems China out of compliance.
</P>
<P>
   Lardy of Brookings calls for a more limited safeguard that would
allow the United States to slap tariffs on its imports from China
if they soar.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of safeguards is to take the risk out of the political
calculations on Capitol Hill that stand in the way of Chinese entry
into the trade group. And that would be a small price to pay, says
Mastel, to help ``make the world's largest nonmarket economy into a
market economy _ the most important economic task on the global
agenda.'' &QL;

DRUG SURVEY OF CHILDREN FINDS MIDDLE SCHOOL A PIVOTAL TIME
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., Ohio, Mich.)  (nk) 
 By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first national drug-abuse survey to include
elementary-school children among the respondents suggests that
youngsters become more vulnerable to the lure of drugs once they
leave the familiar environment of primary school and strive to fit
into middle school.
</P>
<P>
   The new survey, by Pride, an organization based in Atlanta that
counsels schools and parents on ways to inhibit drug use among the
young, also confirms again what many researchers have long known:
that cigarettes, alcohol (primarily beer) and inhalants are used
far more by children than are marijuana or harder drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Pride _ the name is an acronym for the National Parents'
Resource Institute for Drug Education _ issued its findings
Wednesday at its national conference in Cincinnati. Until now,
drug-abuse surveys among children did not focus on those below the
eighth-grade. But Pride's survey questioned pupils from grades four
through six, and among the findings were these:
</P>
<P>
   The proportion of respondents who said they had smoked
cigarettes in the last month jumped to 7 percent of sixth-graders
from 1.6 percent of fourth-graders. Similarly 2.1 percent of
fourth-graders said they drank beer at least once a month, fewer
than half the 4.7 percent of sixth-graders who reported doing so.
Monthly sniffing of glue and other inhalants also rose between the
grades, although less so: to 2.7 percent of sixth-graders from 2.2
percent of fourth-graders.
</P>
<P>
   As for marijuana, only 0.4 percent of fourth-grade pupils
acknowledged having smoked it in the last month, as against 1.7
percent of sixth-graders.
</P>
<P>
   In discussing their findings, officials of Pride also cited
previous research, done for the National Institute on Drug Abuse,
indicating that children's risk of engaging in drug use rises when
they move from elementary school to middle school _ which,
depending on the district, begins in grade five, six or seven _ and
later from middle school to high school. Peer pressure and
association with new friends appear to be the leading causes.
</P>
<P>
   Although marijuana use among the survey's respondents was far
less common than beer drinking or cigarette smoking, the director
of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy noted a
sharp jump in monthly marijuana smoking from fifth-graders (0.6
percent) to sixth (1.7 percent).
</P>
<P>
   ``The reported dramatic increase of marijuana use between the
fifth- and sixth-grades,'' said the director, retired Gen. Barry R.
McCaffrey, ``is a real wake-up call to parents. We have got to get
the word out that the pre-teen years are the key transition period
where parents can play a critical role.''
</P>
<P>
   The findings were based on responses from 26,086 pupils at
public and private schools in 22 states during the 1997-98 school
year. Pride sent a questionnaire to the participating schools with
instructions for administering it, and all answers were anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Hall, a Pride spokesman, said the researchers had used a
test-retest method in which the pupils were asked the same
questions twice within a two-week period to catch any statistical
inconsistencies. But the schools had all volunteered to participate
in the survey, making them somewhat less representative than a
broader nationwide sample would have been.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers found that the children interviewed, who ranged
in age from 9 to 12, seemed to overestimate the number of friends
and classmates who smoked cigarettes, drank beer or experimented
with marijuana. For example, 14 percent of sixth-graders said they
believed that their friends had smoked marijuana, but fewer than 4
percent admitted having tried it themselves at some point.
</P>
<P>
   ``This misperception alone _ that everybody's doing it _ can be
a powerful motivator behind much of the drug use we see,'' said
Thomas J. Gleaton, the president of Pride. ``Youth need an accurate
portrayal of drug use that begins with correcting the misperception
that everyone is doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   The nation's foremost annual survey of youthful drug use,
Monitoring the Future, at the University of Michigan, questions
eighth-graders and up. It asks when they first began using drugs,
and their answers indicate the same leap in experimentation between
elementary school and middle school.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the latest year measured, just 0.9 percent of
eighth-graders said they had first tried marijuana in the
fourth-grade, and 4.2 percent in the sixth-grade. Similarly, 8.3
percent said they had begun drinking alcohol in the fourth-grade,
and 12 percent in the sixth-grade. And 7.8 percent said they had
started smoking cigarettes in the fourth-grade, and 12.4 percent in
the sixth-grade.

 &HT;    Panel is named to plan Freaknik
 &HT;    By Carlos Campos
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Two businessmen and two college students have been
appointed by Mayor Bill Campbell to help oversee Black College
Spring Break weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The committee will meet formally for the first time Monday, just
five days before the event kicks off, to talk about the city's
traffic plan, events, and efforts to coordinate volunteers to walk
the streets during the weekend of April 16-18, said DeWayne Martin,
Campbell's chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   The committee is composed of Charles Kelly, vice president of a
local printing and graphic design company; Yergan Jones, president
of a local sound and lighting company; Markel Hutchins, a student
at Morehouse College; and Byron Amos, a student at Clark Atlanta
University. Last year's group of 18 men and women included business
people, elected officials, police officials and students.
</P>
<P>
   Martin said it's possible additional people will be appointed to
the committee in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
   He said the reduced number of members is not a reflection of the
dwindling size of Freaknik. Martin said the city's plans to handle
crowds and traffic are no different than in previous years.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you know, there's not been as much media coverage this
year,'' Martin said. ``That's not any indication we haven't planned
as extensively as we have in previous years.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the only city-sanctioned events are a weekend street
festival on Auburn Avenue and a job fair on April 17.
</P>
<P>
   Martin said it's impossible to predict how many college students
and partygoers will converge on the city, but Kelly, co-chairman of
the committee, said he thinks fewer people will show up than in
past years.
</P>
<P>
   ``From all indications it will indeed be a smaller event this
year,'' said Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said the committee won't have to meet as much, because it
is using lessons learned from past Freakniks.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's Black College Spring Break Committee issued a report
after the event recommending that the city discourage Freaknik,
based on reports of lewd behavior, assaults on women, traffic jams
and strains on city services, such as police and sanitation.
Campbell has said on several occasions in recent weeks that people
are welcomed to the city for the event, as long as they obey the
law.
</P>
<P>
   Lori Jones, a spokeswoman for the Atlanta Police Department,
said the department is completing a traffic plan for release in the
next few days.

 &HT;    Vidalias: We will sell no onion before its time
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If you come across small onions with greenish outer
skins labeled ``Vidalia'' in the next few days, be warned before
you chomp.
</P>
<P>
   They won't have the signature sweetness of Vidalias _ or the
blessing of Georgia Agriculture Commissioner Tommy Irvin.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin issued a stern warning: Farmers attempting to send onions
to market before their time will be halted.
</P>
<P>
   He took action this week after a committee that helps govern the
Vidalia onion industry expressed concern that in recent years some
farmers have tried to rush young onions to market in order to get
the best prices.
</P>
<P>
   The onions in question are small and have had their tops chopped
off _ they are not the ``Baby Vidalias,'' which are a scallion
variety and still have their green tops.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fear selling the onions on the fresh market would damage
the reputation of the Vidalia,'' said Tina Wheeler, director of the
Vidalia Onion Committee. ``They have a more bitter taste and they
are mushy.''
</P>
<P>
   Irvin told farmers in a letter he would issue a stop-sale order
if unripe onions were discovered in the grading and inspection
process. The onions would have to be destroyed or used only in
processed foods.
</P>
<P>
   A good harvest of fully ripe Vidalia onions is expected to hit
grocery shelves in about two weeks. Then onion lovers will be able
to commence one of their favorite rites of spring _ stuffing the
sweet orbs with bouillon cubes, butter and all sorts of sauces for
roasting.
</P>
<P>
   The Vidalia onion is grown only in Georgia, in a region around
the Toombs County town of Vidalia, where the onion was first
planted in 1931. Today it yields a $90 million industry _ an
estimated 280 million pounds will be harvested this year.
</P>
<P>
   The soil conditions and climate around Vidalia produce onions
that are low in sulfur and high in water, making them milder than
most _ thus their reputation for being ``sweet.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a reputation that's sternly guarded. In 1986, the Georgia
Legislature established a 20-county region around Vidalia as the
only district where onions could belabeled ``Vidalia.

<P>
   PODGORICA, Montenegro, Yugoslavia A democratic reformer,
President Milo Djukanovic
</P>
<P>
   wants closer ties to America and Europe. Tuesday night, his
friends from NATO sent warplanes to drop bombs on his capital.
</P>
<P>
   These are difficult days for Djukanovic and his small Balkan
republic, which with Serbia
</P>
<P>
   forms the Yugoslav Federation.
</P>
<P>
   The president and his ministers openly criticize Yugoslav leader
Slobodan Milosevic, even with 10,000 or more of Milosevic's federal
troops on Montenegrin soil.
</P>
<P>
   Talk of coup or civil war is thick on the streets of Montenegro,
a plight the president
</P>
<P>
   himself concedes has caused profound concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``Montenegro is deeply divided. Tensions are running very high.
We are managing to keep
</P>
<P>
   the situation under control with great effort,'' Djukanovic told
Cox Newspapers in an
</P>
<P>
   interview Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Djukanovic has condemned Milosevic's ``ethnic cleansing'' of the
Serbian province of Kosovo and has defied Serbia by refusing to
declare a state of war against NATO.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, tensions were heightened when NATO warplanes
bombed suspected Serb military targets here. They caused no
injuries and little property damage.
</P>
<P>
   After the attack, Serb army forces frantically fired
anti-aircraft fire into the skies. Because the NATO planes were
long gone, there was suspicion the Serb forces were trying give the
impression of a battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the army did last night was not really a serious attempt
to harm NATO aircraft,'' Djukanovic said.
</P>
<P>
   His government has walked a fine line between the West and
Milosevic's government in Belgrade. He has enacted pro-Western
democratic reforms but has not called for outright independence
from Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a risky political approach,'' he said. ``By trying to
preserve a normal democratic situation in the republic we are in
very much aggravated circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal army and the national currency, the dinar, are
virtually the only aspects of life shared by Serbia and Montenegro.
But U.S.-led attacks on Serb targets have whipped up anti-NATO
sentiment in Montenegro and charges that the Western-leaning
Djukanovic is sleeping with the enemy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a part of the Montenegrin public which is strongly
resentful and they want to interpret this in typically Milosevic
style,'' he said. ``They find it much easier to just divide into
two camps: patriots and traitors.''

SOUTH CAROLINA MOVES CLOSER TO A LOTTERY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ala., N.C., Tenn., Ga., Fla.)  (mk) 
 By KEVIN SACK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A legislative measure to allow South Carolinians to
vote on the lottery hurdled its tallest obstacle Wednesday as the
Republican-majority House of Representatives passed the bill by a
comfortable margin.
</P>
<P>
   The state Senate, which is controlled by Democrats, approved a
lottery bill in January, but attached it to another measure that
would also allow voters to decide whether video poker should remain
legal in South Carolina. The House bill does not include that
amendment and the two chambers now must negotiate an agreement on a
common version.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not expect that to be difficult,'' said Nina Brook, a
spokeswoman for Gov. Jim Hodges, a Democrat who won election last
year by campaigning relentlessly for a statewide lottery that would
benefit education. Ms. Brook said Hodges favors a lottery bill that
is not encumbered by unrelated legislation.
</P>
<P>
   With Wednesday's vote, South Carolina becomes the first of four
Southern states considering lottery measures this year to win
approval for such legislation in both houses. The Legislatures in
Alabama, North Carolina and Tennessee also are debating the lottery
this spring. They are among 13 states that do not have lotteries.
</P>
<P>
   A lottery measure passed the Alabama House late last month and
is under consideration by the Senate. Neither of the chambers in
North Carolina and Tennessee has voted on the issue this year.
</P>
<P>
   Both Hodges and Gov. Don Siegelman of Alabama made the lottery
the central issue in their campaigns last year. Both are Democrats
who unseated Republican incumbents, largely by arguing that the
success of lotteries in neighboring states like Georgia and Florida
made it pointless for their states not to share in the bounty.
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina's lottery debate, the House Republican
majority was long considered the most significant impediment to
gaining the two-thirds vote needed to place a constitutional
amendment on the ballot in the 2000 general election. The House had
voted down lottery bills in previous years, and a number of
prominent Republicans, including Speaker David Wilkins, continued
to oppose the measure. ``Simply put, I don't think it's good for
the state of South Carolina to be in the business of gambling,''
Wilkins said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Typically in Southern states, Republicans have opposed gambling
measures out of both personal conviction and the need to curry
favor with conservative Christians, an active and well-organized
Republican constituency group.
</P>
<P>
   But after Hodges used the lottery issue to upset David Beasley,
the incumbent Republican governor, in last November's election,
many Republicans dropped their opposition and said they would
support giving South Carolinians the right to decide. Public
opinion polls have indicated broad support in South Carolina for
the lottery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone knew that the votes were there and that it
was inevitable, but it still was somewhat disappointing,'' Wilkins
said of Wednesday's 88-31 vote.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's vote was clearly a significant victory for South
Carolina's rookie governor, who demonstrated his interest in the
legislation by making an unusual visit to the House floor when the
debate on the lottery bill began on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Hodges said Wednesday that South Carolina's Legislature had
``made history today'' and predicted that ``South Carolina will
have a lottery with a positive vote of the people.'' He added:
``Now our next goal is to get this bill in final form in both
chambers of the Legislature, to move it on to the people.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill approved Wednesday does not specify how South
Carolina's lottery law would be written or what programs its
proceeds would benefit. But Hodges, a former lottery opponent who
became a convert to the cause while campaigning for governor, has
proposed dedicating the lottery's proceeds to college scholarships,
pre-kindergarten programs, reducing class sizes and other
educational initiatives. That would be similar to Georgia's
lottery, which began in 1993 and has been wildly popular.

RENOVATED CINERAMA THEATER REVIVES ITS GLORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ It may sound like shameless hype, but there's no other
way to say this: the survival and restoration of Seattle's Cinerama
Theater in the late 1990s is simply one of the greatest success
stories in the whole checkered history of movie theater
preservation in America.
</P>
<P>
   When the theater's 35-year lease ran out in March 1997, no
exhibitor was even vaguely interested in the once-luxurious movie
showcase in downtown Seattle. The Seattle media wrote its obituary,
and no sane observer gave the naive, grassroots
``Save-the-Cinerama'' campaign the slightest chance of success.
</P>
<P>
   But two years later, the Cinerama is not only still standing,
it's undergone a multimillion dollar renovation, and will reopen
April 23 as the most technologically advanced, state-of-the-art
cinema, not just in Seattle and the Northwest, but arguably on the
entire planet.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, in what was supposed to be the Cinerama's final
week, I took a last, sad tour of the long-neglected facility _
cringing at the water-damaged walls, crumbling screen, broken seats
and dilapidated fixtures that seemed almost beyond repair.
</P>
<P>
   Late last month, I wandered through the same space and found it
had been not just lovingly restored to its full 1963 glory, but
transformed into a kind of nirvana for movie-lovers _ a theater so
chock full of extras and innovations that it's hard to list them
all.
</P>
<P>
   The fairy godmother in this Cinderella story is, of course,
billionaire movie-fan Paul Allen, who loved the theater as a boy,
bought it on impulse, and has spared no expense in turning it into
both a museum of the old Cinerama process and a vanguard for the
new era in movie exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   And yet the fairy tale _ the story of the rise and fall and
spectacular rise again of the Cinerama Theater _ goes back before
Allen was born, and is a reflection of the meandering currents that
have shaped the history of American motion picture exhibition in
the post-war era.
</P>
<P>
   Cinerama _ the process, not the theater _ was born in 1952 with
the New York debut of ``This is Cinerama,'' a thrill-packed
travelogue that joined three separate images from three different
35mm projectors to create a single image on one giant screen,
curved at a 165 degree angle.
</P>
<P>
   Originally developed by a member of the Paramount special
effects department, the process actually debuted at the 1939
World's Fair, but it wasn't until the threat of television panicked
Hollywood in the early '50s that the company found the funding it
needed to get down to serious business.
</P>
<P>
   It was a smash success _ the three images blending together to
give an illusion of vastness and depth that no previous wide-screen
process had come close to achieving. Within a few years, Cinerama
had a system operating in an existing movie palace in almost every
major city in America.
</P>
<P>
   Through the '50s, even as Fox's single-lens Cinemascope became
the industry standard for wide-screen, Cinerama thrived as a sort
of carnival attraction, a precursor to IMAX, showing big-screen
travelogues like ``Cinerama Holiday,'' and ``Seven Wonders of the
World.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the early '60s, the decision of MGM and Cinerama to
co-produce two big-budget narrative films in the process inspired a
number of exhibitors to invest in a brand new Cinerama idea _
``dedicated'' Cinerama Theaters built from the ground up
specifically to showcase the process.
</P>
<P>
   The Martin theater chain of Columbus, Ga., built Seattle's
827-seat Cinerama in the Denny Regrade neighborhood at a cost of
one million dollars. It began construction just before the World's
Fair in 1962, and opened in January 1963, with George Pal's ``The
Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the first new downtown theater in 35 years, and was
designed for both a spacious, movie-palace luxury, and a futuristic
sleekness that reflected the 1962 World's Fair and the Space
Needle.
</P>
<P>
   The second film to play the Cinerama, the epic western ``How the
West Was Won,'' was a blockbuster hit, but it was also the end of
``three-panel'' Cinerama. Hard-pressed MGM suddenly deemed the
format too expensive to continue the partnership, and no other
studio was interested.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, in 1964, the company began producing epic films shot in
single-lens 70mm, but bearing the old Cinerama logo, and designed
to fit the specially curved Cinerama screen: films like ``It's a
Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World,'' ``Grand Prix,'' ``Khartoum,'' ``Ice
Station Zebra'' and ``2001: A Space Odyssey.''
</P>
<P>
   By the early '70s, these single-lens Cinerama films _ most of
them deluxe, hard-ticket, ``roadshow'' releases _ were also deemed
too expensive to produce, especially when Cinerama's rivals began
blowing up standard 35mm film to 70mm and passing it off as the
real thing.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, the Cinerama Company liquidated, and vanished from the
movie scene. But Seattle's Cinerama theater survived as the city's
prime venue for big-screen Hollywood epics. Even though the curved
Cinerama screen tended to distort the image at the corners,
audiences loved the place.
</P>
<P>
   For several generations of movie-goers, the Cinerama was the
theater for a big date or special outing. Something about its
convenient location, its plush seats, its wide leg-room, its
perfect sight-lines, its awesome floor-to-ceiling screen, and its
space-age-moderne decor was ... well, magical.
</P>
<P>
   Through the '80s and mid-'90s, the superstar reigned supreme. In
the wake of the big boom in science-fiction created by ``Star
Wars'' in 1977, it became known as Seattle's sci-fi showcase: the
ultimate temple to appreciate ``Blade Runner,'' ``The Black Hole''
or the revival of the ``Star Wars'' trilogy.
</P>
<P>
   But when its original 35-year lease ran out March 1997, Cineplex
Odeon _ which bought SRO in 1987 _ suddenly announced it had no
interest in a renewal. The economics of single-screen theaters no
longer made sense, and the trend was suddenly toward big downtown
multiplexes.
</P>
<P>
   When no other theater chain expressed interest in the lease and
the owner _ Rainier Properties _ began speaking of a five-story
apartment house that could be built on the site, a grassroots
preservation campaign quickly arose, led by local movie publicist
Janet Wainwright.
</P>
<P>
   For the next year, Cineplex Odeon continued to show films in the
theater without a lease, the physical decline of the doomed
facility escalated, and the ``Save-the-Cinerama'' campaign _ taken
up by several local radio personalities and a dedicated band of
volunteers _ refused to give in to the inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1998, one of the group's petitions caught the eye of
Paul Allen, who'd stopped by his local video store to buy some
DVDs. With many fond memories of the Cinerama, he signed the
petition, then, a week later, bought the theater for $3.75 million.
</P>
<P>
   When it finally reopens on April 23, the New Cinerama will be a
big step forward into the new era of movie exhibition, with the
world's first ``active'' movie posters, a breakthrough sound
system, acoustics to rival any symphony hall in the world, and
capacity for digital or ``filmless'' cinema.
</P>
<P>
   But what is perhaps even more impressive is the theater's
dedication to its own past _ including a lavish interior
redecoration so faithful to the original's space-chic motif that
the concession stand actually uses specially designed, '60s-style
popcorn and soft-drink containers.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, the restoration has gone to enormous lengths to
preserve the theater's most famous feature: its giant, curved
screen _ which will stand behind a new ``flat'' screen (more
suitable for current films), but can be exposed for revival
screenings of the great films of the Cinerama past.
</P>
<P>
   By the year 2000, the theater will restore the two side
projection booths and replace the old three-projector system, so it
will be one of only three theaters in the world capable of showing
the old three-panel Cinerama films of the '50s and early '60s.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly what place the new Cinerama will occupy in the movie
firmament of the new century is, at this point, hard to predict.
It'll be booked and managed by Boston-based General Cinema Corp.,
America's largest movie-theater chain, and ticket prices will be
comparable to the other downtown houses.
</P>
<P>
   With its past reputation and its many new innovations, it will
likely resume its former position as the special place to see a
special movie in Seattle _ to the point that getting in could be
tough. What die-hard fan will want to see ``Star Wars: Episode
One'' anywhere else?
</P>
<P>
   The theater seems destined to find its own unique place as
Seattle's ultimate movie showplace, as the West Coast's most deluxe
revival-house for the great Cinerama and 70mm films of the
Hollywood past, and as America's on-going, prototype cinema for the
new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Ten reasons Seattle's newly restored Cinerama Theater can lay
claim to being the most user-friendly, technically advanced,
state-of-the-art movie house in the world:
</P>
<P>
   - The first ``active'' movie posters, a quartet (two in the
lobby, two outside facing the street) of 42-inch-tall plasma
screens that can display both old-fashioned static one-sheets and
multimedia film trailers combining sound, music and high-resolution
video.
</P>
<P>
   - Full capability for Electronic Cinema, a pioneering new
image-delivery technology that will eventually feed digitized
motion pictures directly to projectors via disk or fiber-optic
cable _ making celluloid film obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   - A ``breakthrough'' digital sound system designed by noted
consultant Neil Grant to deliver ``the richest motion-picture
surround experience in the world,'' plus a second, old-fashioned
analog sound system that can be used for accurate presentations of
Cinerama classics.
</P>
<P>
   - Acoustics to ``rival any symphony hall in the world,'' making
use of special building materials, air diffusers, a series of
computer-designed sound baffles, and a revolutionary
sound-wave-shaped ceiling, the first of its kind in the country.
</P>
<P>
   - Rear-window captioning and assistive-listening devices for the
hard of hearing, audio narration devices for the blind and seeing
impaired, removable wide seats for the obese, and wheelchair access
to seemingly every inch of the space _ even the projection booth.
</P>
<P>
   - Two box offices.
</P>
<P>
   - A theater store that will sell movie memorabilia, soundtracks
and perhaps the equivalent of the old slick souvenir programs that
were regularly sold at roadshow engagements of films like ``The
Greatest Story Ever Told,'' and ``How the West Was Won.''
</P>
<P>
   - Seattle's first outside digital marquee, replacing the former
marquee that wrapped around the corner of Fourth Avenue and Lenora
Street.
</P>
<P>
   - An adjustable screen system _ a modern ``flat'' screen for
contemporary films that can be dismantled in eight hours to reveal
a huge, curved, early 1960s-style Cinerama screen for revivals of
both three-panel and single-lens Cinerama movies.
</P>
<P>
   - A dedication to the vanishing,
single-screen-moviegoing-experience in all its glory. No lines to
get in the tiny auditoriums down the hall. No gourmet restaurant
food or alcoholic beverages served. No noisy video games polluting
the lobby.

   MAMMOTH LAKES, Calif. _ Boating and camping often go hand in
hand in the Eastern Sierra, and anglers towing vessels for the
trout opener should have no trouble with frozen campsites.
</P>
<P>
   All major roadside lakes and surrounding campgrounds are
ice-free, a far cry from last year's opener, when resilient snow
precluded camping at Convict Lake, Crowley Lake's North Landing and
the June Lake Loop.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had so much grass growing, we had to mow it. And we had
flowers growing. Then we just got a foot of snow,'' Convict Lake
Resort general manager David DeSurra said Wednesday after a
late-season storm. ``But we're sure it's going to melt soon, the
sun is shining so bright.''
</P>
<P>
   Boat launching at Convict is free, but overnight dock spaces are
sold out. Boat rentals are $65 per day. Camping is $11 a night,
first-come, first serve, starting at 2 p.m. April 21. Information:
(760) 934-3800.
</P>
<P>
   Camping at Crowley is $20 a night or $40 for five nights, April
22-26. Launching is $12, or $30 for the season. Dock spaces are $85
for the five nights (launching not included). Boat rentals have
been booked since Jan. 4. Day-use parking is $6. Information: (760)
935-4301.
</P>
<P>
   At June Lake: Launch fees are $10 at June Lake Marina, dock
spaces are $20 a night (launching included) and a three-day boat
rental is $170. Information: (760) 648-7726. Launching is $5 at Big
Rock Landing, dock spaces are sold out (but shoreline tie-ups are
$5) and a two-day boat rental is $85. Information: (760) 648-7717.
Campsites within the June Lake Loop are $12 and managed by Pyramid
Enterprises, (800) 416-6992.

<P>
   Most campsites in the Inyo and Humboldt-Toiyabe national forests
are first-come, first-serve; reservations for those sites that have
them available can be made by calling the National Recreation
Reservation Service, (877) 444-6777 or (800) 280-2267. (Note:
Forest Service officials warn that callers have experienced
``terrible'' problems in getting through to the service and
securing reservations.)

U.S. SAYS SERB COMMANDERS COULD BE CHARGED WITH WAR CRIMES &HT;    
 &HT;   
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    By GREG McDONALD 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States warned Serb commanders Wednesday
that they could be charged with war crimes for carrying out the
brutal ``depopulation'' of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   As allied forces entered the 15th day of their bombing campaign
aimed at driving the forces of Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic out of Kosovo, there were reports of a Cypriot diplomatic
mission to Belgrade aimed at winning the release of three U.S.
soldiers who were taken captive last week by Serb troops on the
border of Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavian officials said the three were being treated well and
confirmed that Milosevic was planning to meet today with Spyros
Kyprianou, the acting president of Cyprus, who hopes to win their
release.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration welcomed the news of Kyprianou's
surprise trip to Belgrade, and State Department officials said the
United States would provide a plane to help facilitate his mission.
But they made it clear that the release of the soldiers, including
Spc. Steven M. Gonzales, of Huntsville, Texas, must have no strings
attached.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that will be acceptable is an unconditional
release,'' said State Department spokesman James Rubin.
</P>
<P>
   In a prepared statement, Gilbert and Rosie Gonzales of
Huntsville, who learned from television of the efforts to free
their eldest son, said the development ``really raises our hopes.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization headquarters
in Brussels, Belgium, made it clear that even if the soldiers are
freed, the bombing and missile attacks on Serb military targets
will continue with ``unremitting'' and ``ruthless efficiency,'' as
Air Commodore David Wilby put it.
</P>
<P>
   Wilby's remarks were reinforced by Defense Secretary William
Cohen, who was in Brussels to meet with his NATO counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO indeed intends to stay the course. This is no time to
pause,'' Cohen said, referring to what he called ongoing acts of
``unspeakable brutality'' by Milosevic's forces in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Cohen spoke with reporters, the allies again hit
targets in downtown Belgrade and throughout Serbia and Kosovo.
Serbian television reported another military headquarters building
was hit, and Pentagon officials confirmed that a small unmanned
NATO reconnaissance drone was shot down by Serb anti-aircraft fire.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, meanwhile, rejected continuing efforts by
Milosevic to end the bombing by pushing his cease-fire proposal.
Belgrade officials said it calls for the resettlement of nearly
600,000 Kosovar refugees now in camps in Albania, Macedonia and
Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not enough now for Mr. Milosevic to say that his forces
will cease fire in Kosovo, denied its freedom and devoid of its
people. He must withdraw his forces, let the refugees return,
permit the deployment of an international security force. Nothing
less will bring peace with security to the people of Kosovo,''
Clinton said in a major foreign policy address here.
</P>
<P>
   As NATO entered its third week of bombing, allied officials
reported what Wilby referred to as the most ``robust'' and
successful day`` yet for allied planes. Wilby said that 439 sorties
were flown Tuesday night, with targets ranging from Serb armored
columns to oil refineries and weapons factories in 28 areas in
Kosovo and Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Allied officials also reported that for the first time, NATO
warplanes were able to carry out low daylight attacks on several
armored units operating in Kosovo, including one column of seven to
12 vehicles. Wilby said the pilots flew close enough to have a
clear view from the cockpit as their cluster bombs hit their
targets.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the missions flown prior to Tuesday night, Wilby said,
were carried out from greater distances using guided bombs and
missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Wilby quickly added, however, that Serb forces still have
significant air defense systems, including surface-to-air missiles.
He said at least one SAM site was taken out along the border of
Montenegro on Tuesday night when it locked on to group of NATO
warplanes. Three more Russian-made MiG fighters were destroyed
during an attack on a military airstrip in Pristina, Kosovo, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Citing intelligence sources, Pentagon officials said Wednesday
that there is growing evidence of dissension within the ranks of
both the Yugoslav army and security police.
</P>
<P>
   In a message aimed at fomenting more division, the State
Department released the names of nine Serb commanders in Kosovo,
warning them that they will be held responsible for atrocities
carried out by troops under their direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are naming these nine commanders as a warning to them that
the world is watching,'' Rubin said, adding that ``in the coming
days, terrible things further could happen in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   The State Department and NATO released a report Wednesday that
will be presented to the international war crimes tribunal at The
Hague in the Netherlands outlining evidence of killings and other
atrocities by Serb forces.

Rockets guard Price has cartilage surgery
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By MICHAEL MURPHY &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
Price
</P>
<P>
   Rockets point guard Brent Price underwent surgery Wednesday to
repair torn cartilage in his right knee and is expected to be back
in time for the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   While it was thought that Matt Maloney would be activated off
the injured list, the Rockets did not make a move Wednesday to fill
Price's roster spot. They are expected to announce a move before
today's game against the San Antonio Spurs at Compaq Center.
</P>
<P>
   Price hurt his knee in Tuesday's 111-74 victory over Golden
State, tearing the right lateral meniscus on the last play of the
first half when he landed awkwardly after making a pass to Scottie
Pippen.
</P>
<P>
   Team physicians Walter Lowe and Bruce Moseley performed the
30-minute surgery Wednesday morning, finding a tear that was larger
than anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brent's surgery went well,'' Lowe said. ``This was a pretty
big tear. It was pretty much how the MRI looked, but it was a tear
that had caused a flap (of tissue) that could catch between the two
bones _ flip back and forth between them.
</P>
<P>
   ``So it was one that definitely needed to come out. It was
definitely not a repairable tear. What you do is take out the torn
part of it and leave as much good cartilage as you can. It was
probably 15 or 20 percent of that cartilage (removed with the
tear), so it was a pretty significant cartilage tear.''
</P>
<P>
   The increased severity of the tear may not add any other time to
Price's recovery schedule. There is a possibility he could be back
in two weeks, which is how long it took Charles Barkley to return
from a similar _ if less severe _ cartilage tear in his left knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nothing to really slow him down,'' Lowe said. ``As
long as he doesn't swell. It's going to be a little tougher than a
small tear like Charles had, but from the way he's recovered from
some other (injuries), he could still hold to a pretty quick
(recovery) time frame.''
</P>
<P>
   Price missed the 1994-95 season with a torn anterior cruciate
ligament in his left knee. Price's first season in Houston
(1996-97) was marred by a broken bone in his left arm and a torn
ACL in his left knee, injuries that limited him to 25 games.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe said Price wasn't in the best of spirits, but wasn't overly
depressed about suffering yet another injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I think it's good his dad (Denny Price) was in town,
because Denny is a pretty level-headed guy,'' Lowe said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brent wasn't the most excited guy I've ever seen this morning,
but he's pretty experienced with this stuff. I guess you have to
use the old adage, he took it in stride. He was sitting up, awake
in the recovery room last time I saw him, saying, `Oh, I guess it's
time to get to work.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he was as bummed as he would have been had this
been a new tear of an ACL (anterior cruciate ligament) or some
injury that would have a prolonged recovery, but I still don't
think he had the greatest day.''
</P>
<P>
   Price had scored double figures in the three games before
Tuesday's victory over Golden State and had made 14 of 26 3-point
attempts over the last nine games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just thought Brent was playing really, really positive
basketball and was a big asset for us,'' coach Rudy Tomjanovich
said. ``This happens to a lot of teams _ we've seen this all over
the league. We just have to do the best we can to step up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really feel for him. He came here as a free agent, looked at
the system and thought it was a good place for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``But a couple days into our first year here, I think it was our
third practice, he goes down (with the broken bone in his arm). And
then he works his way back and gets hurt again (left knee).
</P>
<P>
   ``He was really getting into a groove, had his role defined and
was doing a real good job at it. But it's not over. He's a tough
guy. He could still be back and still be a positive for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Scottie Pippen hopes players like Bryce Drew and Maloney will be
able to pick up the slack in Price's absence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be hard to replace what Brent does for this
ballclub, because he really goes after the ball so hard,'' Pippen
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we have some young guys like Bryce, who has been waiting
for this opportunity to get out there and play. He is going to have
to find some type niche where he is able to help this ballclub
right now. I think he will.''

PROSECUTOR DEFENDS CHARGES OF TEST TAMPERING AGAINST AUSTIN SCHOOL
DISTRICT 
</HEADLINE>
  (kd)

<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The county attorney in Austin said Wednesday that
indictments against the city's school district and a top
administrator for manipulating statewide assessment test scores
were a hard but necessary measure to prevent tampering.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Oden, the Travis county attorney, said that the indictments
handed up by a grand jury on Tuesday were the first against a Texas
school district. A nationwide school coalition said the charges
were believed to be the first in the country against a major school
district.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is that as we rely more on standardized testing
and standardized ratings for schools there is greater and greater
pressure and emphasis on obtaining the best possible rating for
your school and school district,'' Oden said. ``That provides
greater temptation to manipulate the data in a way to create the
most favorable image for your school, your district or your
state.''
</P>
<P>
   In Austin, he said, district officials succumbed to that
pressure last spring, when they scored the Texas Assessment of
Academic Skills test, which is used to rate the performance of both
students and schools. The rankings provide a gauge for how schools
are performing, and poor performance can be an embarrassment to a
district, and a temptation to manipulate data, Oden said.
</P>
<P>
   In two separate 16-count indictments, a grand jury charged that
the district and a deputy superintendent, Margaret Kay Psencik,
were involved in altering government records. A third district
employee, Ricky Arredondo, who Oden said worked in the district
offices and actually changed the records, pleaded no contest to
charges of altering government documents prior to his appearance
before the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   The indictments say changes were made in identification numbers
on results from the spring 1998 Texas Assessment of Academic Skills
test.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, Social Security numbers are used, but when those are
not available, numbers are assigned. According to prosecutors,
there was a one-week period when, if an identification number was
changed, the test score was not recorded because it was viewed as
invalid. The indictments say the ID numbers of 16 low-scoring
students were changed so their scores would be invalidated.
</P>
<P>
   The impact went even further because the school population is
divided into subgroups. If a subgroup has fewer than 30 students,
their performance is not even included in the ranking material,
Oden said. So by taking out the 16 low-scoring students, whole sets
of students were removed.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Minton, the lawyer representing Ms. Psencik, said the deputy
superintendent maintained that identification numbers were changed
as a matter of course in recording data and said she had done
nothing wrong.
</P>
<P>
   As the district officials struggled to understand what the
criminal charges would mean to them, officials acknowledged that
the situation illustrated what can happen as increased focus is
placed on school performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an inherent pressure and all school districts face it
and in this instance we crossed the line,'' said Andy Welch,
communications officer of the district, which has 77,000 students.
``The adjustments were made for the sole purpose of trying to make
those schools look better. Who was involved in that and the extent
to which they were involved and who should be punished for that is
for the criminal justice system to decide.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The school district had been aware of the situation since late
last summer when it was notified by the Texas Education Agency that
some of the test results appeared to be out of line. A consultant
was brought in by the acting superintendent, A.C. Gonzalez, who
issued a report resulting in three schools having their ratings
dropped. Two elementary schools dropped from acceptable to low
while another dropped from a top rank of exemplary to a mid-level
rank of acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   While no charges have been brought in other school districts in
the state, problems have occurred. A Houston Independent School
District teacher was fired for allegedly using an answer key to
correct student forms and two principals were reprimanded for not
making the tests more secure. In neighboring Fort Bend School
District, just outside Houston, a principal and teacher resigned in
the midst of a TAAS test-tampering investigation.
</P>
<P>
   A conviction for tampering with governmental records could
result in a fine of up to $160,000 to the school district and
Psencik faces up to a year in jail and a $4,000 fine. Ms. Psencik
was placed on paid leave Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But Oden said he viewed a fine as a last resort. He said he was
seeking organizational changes to prevent test-tampering. He was
also continuing his investigation of records manipulation.

US SEEKS TALKS WITH LIBYA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLUM LYNCH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The Clinton administration has secretly
approached Libya through a UN mediator to request the first
face-to-face talks since the two nations broke diplomatic ties
nearly two decades ago, according to senior US and Libyan
officials.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative by Washington reflects a desire to explore
improved relations with Tripoli following its handover of two
suspects in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103. But senior
administration officials cautioned that Libya's continued support
for terrorism remains an obstacle to a significant thaw in
relations between the two adversaries.
</P>
<P>
   UN Secretary General Kofi Annan delivered a request for talks
from the US representative to the United Nations, Peter Burleigh,
to Libya's UN ambassador, Abuzed Omar Dorda, more than two weeks
ago, according to sources. The discussions _ which are to focus on
UN sanctions against Libya _ would be hosted by Annan and include
the ambassadors of the US, Britain and Libya, according to Dorda.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are ready any time they are,'' Dorda said in an interview.
``Dialogue is the solution. Any normalization of relations, any
cooperation will be to the benefit of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States is planning to use the meetings to seek
further assurances from Libya that it will renounce terrorism,
adequately compensate the relatives of the Pan Am victims, and
cooperate with a Scottish court trying the Lockerbie suspects in
the Netherlands. Libya hopes to obtain guarantees that sanctions
will be lifted once and for all.
</P>
<P>
   Burleigh declined to comment on the talks. However, a senior US
official confirmed that the initiative was under consideration. The
official said it was simply one among ``a number of proposals'' to
be debated by members of the UN Security Council over the coming
months as it considers whether to lift sanctions on Libya.
</P>
<P>
   Khalil Matar, a Lebanese journalist who has covered the UN for
more than a decade, said Britain, South Africa and Saudi Arabia _
the key mediators in the current dispute with Libya _ have pressed
the US in recent months to reward Libya for its surrender of the
two suspects with face to face talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Americans initially didn't want a meeting,'' Matar said.
``They were forced into it.'' But he added that Washington's
willingness ``to sit down at the same table'' represents a tacit
recognition that ``Libya has changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Libya's ambassador said that Annan and Britain's UN ambassador,
Sir Jeremy Greenstock, are still hammering out the final details of
the negotiations. He said he did not know if the discussions were
intended to be held in secret. But he added that he hoped the
discussions would lead towards smoother ties with Washington, which
broke ties with Tripoli in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the UN Security Council voted to suspend a ban on air
travel and a series of economic sanctions imposed on Libya between
1992 and 1993. Annan is due to report on whether Libya has met its
obligations to have sanctions lifted permanently. The discussions
are aimed at helping reaching an agreement between the three
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say Libya's handover of the two Libyan intelligence
agents marked a major shift in Libya's relations with the outside
world. And it has set the stage for the diplomatic initiative in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is clearly the most significant development in US-Libyan
relations since Lockerbie,'' said Gideon Rose, deputy director of
national security at the Council on Foreign Relations. ``The
surrender of the suspects for trial is setting in motion a huge
chain of events that are going to fundamentally alter Libya's
relations with the outside world.''
</P>
<P>
   Libya has been among the top of America's list of foreign
enemies since Washington severed relations in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   It has retained a place on the State Department's list of
terrorist nations.
</P>
<P>
   Its alleged sponsorship of terrorist acts against US citizens _
primarily the killing of 189 Americans aboard Pan Am 103 _ remains
a huge obstacle to any efforts to improve Libya's relations with
Washington, said Bruce Hoffman, the head of Rand Corp.'s Washington
office.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman, the author of ``Inside Terrorism,'' said Libyan leader
Moammar Khadafy has sponsored numerous attacks against US and
British targets. But he said that while US of intelligence still
suspects Libya of developing chemical weapons agents, Tripoli has
moderated its position since the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have shied away from sponsorship of terrorism,'' said
Hoffman. ``These talks could pave the way for Libya being taken off
the list of terrorists.''
</P>
<P>
   A key obstacle of any rapproachment is the opposition of the Pan
Am 103 relatives. Many fear the case in the Netherlands will
overlook Khadafy's involvement. The handover Monday already angered
some relatives, such as Susan Cohen of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``What kind of justice is this?'' said Cohen, who lost her
20-year-old daughter in the explosion. ``This deal exonerates
Khadafy.''

 &HT;    History on tape turns 25
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHAPEL HILL, N.C. _ In a visit with an elderly glove maker, oral
historian Jacquelyn Dowd Hall was struggling to explain why she
wanted to record her recollections on a tape recorder.
</P>
<P>
   The artisan interrupted Hall with her own memorable assessment:
``You don't have to be famous for your life to be history,'' Nell
Sigmon told her interviewer.
</P>
<P>
   Those simple, eloquent words have survived as the credo of the
South's first major oral history program, today celebrating its
25th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   Historians, authors and others who trained under Hall, director
of the Southern Oral History Program at the University of North
Carolina, return to Chapel Hill for a scholarly yet emotional
reminiscence among people who gathered, word by word, strands of
the South's tumultuous past.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the hundreds of cotton mill workers, civil rights
activists, prominent politicians and common folks interviewed years
ago are now dead, creating a sense of urgency among oral
historians. They worry that ever-quickening social and economic
changes will wipe away memories worth preserving.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no use for a cotton mill ... but I had to do it. I had
to make bread and butter,'' textile worker John Wesley Snipes of
Bynum, N.C., said in 1979. His recollections were among many that
shaped ``Like a Family _ The Making of a Southern Cotton Mill
World,'' an early, influential project of the Southern Oral History
Program.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, the program's graduate students and research
associates interviewed former employees of the now-closed White
Furniture Co. in Mebane, N.C. In a collection of poignant
photographs and words published as ``Closing _The Life and Death of
An American Factory,'' photographer Bill Bamberger and writer Cathy
Davidson captured part of the essence of workers such as Don
McCall.
</P>
<P>
   Watching people punch the time clock for the last time, McCall
said, ``It's just like, you know, their feet dropped on the floor
and their hearts (dropped, too).''
</P>
<P>
   Hall, 55, said the Southern Oral History Program has
distinguished itself by focusing on more than collecting interviews
and preserving them in library archives. It has trained students to
carry on the work at other institutions, and it has taught local
history clubs, church groups and other community institutions how
to delve into their past.
</P>
<P>
   The UNC program's latest major project is ``Listening for a
Change,'' in which historians are recording stories of North
Carolinians primarily since World War II. Topics include school
desegregation in Charlotte, Hispanic migration to Durham, the
transition of Eastern North Carolina tobacco farmers and memories
of a black school in Asheville.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not an advocacy project in and of itself, but we
believe, as historians do, that understanding the past is critical
to living well and responsibly in the present,'' Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   Often the words gathered by the Southern Oral History Program
were spoken by people who otherwise might never have been heard
beyond quiet talk on front porches.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are recording the stories of people's lives that they
themselves do not even think of as history,'' said Will Jones, 29,
a UNC doctoral student. He is interviewing African-Americans who in
the 1930s and '40s worked in sawmills in North Carolina, Alabama
and Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   Bits of Atlanta's history are among the more than 2,000
interviews _ on tapes and transcripts _ in the Southern Historical
Collection on the Chapel Hill campus.
</P>
<P>
   Two cassette tapes and 67 typed pages contain the calm,
reflective voice of John Lewis, the civil rights activist who was
raised poor in Pike County, Ala., but is now a U.S. congressman
from Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``We crossed the bridge and we met a sea of state troopers,''
Lewis said in a 1973 interview, recalling the 1965 ``Bloody
Sunday'' confrontation in Selma, Ala., that led ultimately to the
triumphant Selma-to-Montgomery march. Lewis suffered a fractured
skull during the attack by deputies and state troopers wielding
clubs and bullwhips. ``I felt frightened. I felt that we had to
stay there.'' The interview with Lewis came a year before the
creation of the Southern Oral History Program, reflecting the
fledgling efforts in a field that is now soaring in popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Brokaw's best-selling book ``The Greatest Generation,''
based on recollections by World War II veterans, illustrates the
poignancy and the broad appeal of oral history, one of the oldest
methods of historical research.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is no longer simply for library archives,'' said Cliff
Kuhn, 46, assistant professor of history at Georgia State
University.
</P>
<P>
   A doctoral student who studied at UNC under Hall in the late
1970s, Kuhn ranked the Southern Oral History Program as one of the
nation's three most influential, along with the University of
California at Los Angeles and Columbia University in New York City.

BIG MONEY WINNER MAY BE BOSTON CABBIE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: Michigan, Illinois, Virgina, Georgia, Maryland)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CINDY RODRIGUEZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The winner of the $197 million lottery jackpot did not
come forward Wednesday, but drivers for a local taxi company
believe it was one of their own: an African immigrant who drives a
taxi 60 hours a week.
</P>
<P>
   John Ford, the vice president of Town Taxi in Boston, said a man
who drives one of his cabs asked a pool of cabbies at Logan Airport
Wednesday if they knew the winning numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Someone read aloud from a newspaper, ``12, 17, 22, 33 and 44,
and Big Money Ball number 25,'' and the man said with a laugh,
``That's my ticket! I won!''
</P>
<P>
   The others didn't believe him until they crowded around to look
at the ticket, according to Ford, who said he talked to two drivers
who said they have seen the ticket. ``Oh my God, you won!'' someone
screamed, and then more people started rushing over.
</P>
<P>
   The driver became frazzled, jumped into his cab and drove off.
His cab, No. 697, hadn't been found by the taxi company by
Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't find him anywhere,'' Ford said. ``We'd like to know
how he's doing. . . . I'd like to adopt him.''
</P>
<P>
   He was supposed to turn the cab in at 4 p.m., but never returned
and didn't respond to radio dispatches.
</P>
<P>
   Ford knows little about the man, and wasn't sure how to spell
his last name. Since he is an independent contractor, his name is
not listed in company documents.
</P>
<P>
   Lottery spokeswoman Susan Frigoletto said that at this point,
any speculation is purely rumor. Until the person walks into
lottery headquarters in Braintree with the winning ticket, there is
no winner.
</P>
<P>
   Frigoletto said it's not uncommon for a person to wait days,
even weeks, before walking in to claim their prize.
</P>
<P>
   ``People need to gain their composure, find an attorney,''
Frigoletto said. ``From what I've heard from winners I've met, it's
kind of like a state of shock. . . . Someone is holding on to a
piece of paper and it's worth $197 million.''
</P>
<P>
   Whoever has the ticket will win the largest jackpot in
Massachusetts history and the second largest jackpot in the
country, behind the $295 million Power Ball win last year.
</P>
<P>
   The winner can choose one lump-sum payment of $70.2 million
after taxes, or $5.1 million every year, after taxes, for 26 years.
</P>
<P>
   Six states participated in the Big Game lottery: Michigan,
Illinois, Virgina, Georgia, Maryland, and Massachusetts. The chance
of winning was 1 in 76 million.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, a sweeping banner stretched across a metal awning at
the Star Market in the Fenway, where the ticket was sold, which
read: ``WE SOLD THE $197,000 MILLION DOLLAR BIG GAME WINNING
TICKET.''
</P>
<P>
   Store Manager Martin O'Halloran said he, too, had heard the
rumor of a winning taxi driver, and said he just hopes it's someone
who works hard and needs the money. The Town Taxi where the rumored
winner works is near the Star Market where the ticket was sold.
</P>
<P>
   Back at the dispatch office for Town Taxi, dispatchers kept
talking about the cabbie who apparently won.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was me, I would've parked the cab and left,'' said Phil
Sales, a dispatcher.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, who said he doesn't know the driver well, described him as
``a kicked-back, quiet'' guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not very excitable. He's a very pleasant guy. A calm,
quiet guy,'' Ford said.
</P>
<P>
   He's in his mid-30s, married, has several children, and lives in
working-class Chelsea.
</P>
<P>
   He works the 4 a.m.-to-4 p.m. shift, and Ford said he believes
he's from Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   Ford said he works long hours, ``But not anymore.''

FOX MOVES TO RECLAIM COMMERCIAL TIME FROM ITS AFFILIATES
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a move that could help radically alter the
relationship between broadcast networks and their affiliated
stations, the Fox network is unilaterally reclaiming for itself
more than 20 percent of the commercial time now sold by its local
affiliated stations in prime time.
</P>
<P>
   The president of the Fox television network, Lawrence Jacobson,
informed the network's affiliated station owners in a letter dated
April 6 that starting July 1 it would cut back to 70 a week from 90
a week the number of 30-second commercials available for local
affiliates to sell in Fox's prime-time shows. The result will be a
shift of an estimated $50 million to $100 million a year from the
stations to the network, which is owned by the News Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The Fox move is the boldest in a series of recent moves by the
networks to try to change their traditional relationship with
affiliates, which dates back to the early days of radio, and
executives at several of the other networks said it might encourage
them to take stronger action. One senior executive at a competing
network said the Fox decision was ``a revolutionary move in this
business.''
</P>
<P>
   The broadcast networks, other than General Electric's NBC, the
industry leader, have struggled in recent years to make any profit
at all, as program costs have escalated and audiences have
continued to shift to cable television. At the same time, local
television stations are enjoying profits margins of as much as 50
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the networks, CBS, NBC and Walt Disney's ABC, still pay
affiliates an annual fee to carry their programs. The networks have
tried in recent years to adjust that fee or to receive financial
help from the stations in paying for expensive programming like NFL
games and the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   In several instances they have succeeded. But the affiliates
have resisted any attempt to eliminate or cut back the annual
compensation fees they receive from the networks.
</P>
<P>
   In a system that was established in the early days of radio,
networks provide programming to stations and they divide up the
commercial time sold for the programs, with the networks keeping
most of the slots.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the managers of Fox stations only received the letter
Wednesday, and several declined to comment until they could study
the information.
</P>
<P>
   But Dennis Fitzsimons, the president of Tribune Broadcasting,
which owns six Fox affiliates, said: ``At first glance this is
surely not in our economic interest. It's something we're going to
have to evaluate to decide what our options are. We are not
particularly happy about it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Jacobson declined to comment or to make the letter available
Wednesday. In a copy obtained by The New York Times, Jacobson told
the managers of the Fox affiliates that the network had
``determined that it is necessary to make an adjustment to the
economic relationship between the network and Fox affiliates to
take into account the ever widening imbalance in profits between
us.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter cites a clause in the Fox affiliate agreement that
allows the network to change the ratio of network and local
commercials.
</P>
<P>
   The 178 Fox affiliates may be more vulnerable to pressure than
the affiliates of other networks because many of them were weaker
independent stations whose asset value increased enormously after
they joined with Fox in the late 1980s and the network became
successful. It would also be more difficult for many of them to
defect to another network in the same city because of pre-existing
affiliation deals.
</P>
<P>
   Last year CBS, ABC and Fox all tried to win some financial
concessions from their affiliates to help pay for the new
television deal with the NFL, which will cost each of those
networks at least $500 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   CBS said it received about $50 million from its affiliates. In
exchange CBS established a floor level for the number of
commercials it would allow the affiliates to sell in prime time.
The network has achieved the most compatible current arrangement
with its affiliates.
</P>
<P>
   Fox also made a deal with affiliates to gain money to pay for
the NFL. But when ABC tried to secure help on football, it ran into
stiff resistance. One big area of dispute came over the issue of
the exclusivity that affiliates expect for network programs. ABC
wants to sell its programs to secondary markets.
</P>
<P>
   Only last week a new effort by ABC to work out an affiliate deal
to help pay for football fell through. It was affected by a deal
that NBC, which has had its own confrontations over the exclusivity
issue, struck with the USA Networks television studio, which
produces NBC's hit series ``Law and Order.''
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for a lower price for new episodes of that series,
NBC agreed to take a new series from USA Networks, and allow it to
be replayed on the USA Networks cable channel within 10 days. ABC
asked its affiliates for a ``most favored nation'' clause that
would permit it to make the same kind of deals that other networks
made. The affiliates refused and talks broke down.
</P>
<P>
   Now ABC intends to make deals with affiliates on a case-by-case
basis. One senior executive familiar with ABC's affiliate
negotiations said: ``The Fox deal has to help. The affiliates have
to see it's getting to be the Wild West out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms presented to the Fox affiliates, they would be
compelled to give back the 20 commercials, but could buy them back
for a price less than top market value. The stations would lose the
money entirely if they did not agree. To add to the pressure, Fox
said it would sell the commercials wherever it could get the best
price. That would include the local markets _ meaning Fox would be
selling against its own affiliates in some cities.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzsimons acknowledged that ``Fox is making the most powerful,
most aggressive move to change the structure of the
network-affiliate relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   But he disputed the notion that networks need to redefine their
relationship with affiliates in order to survive economically,
saying that when networks lament the lack of profits, they never
include the enormous profits being made by the stations they
themselves own, nor the profits they make in sales of shows they
own in syndication.
</P>
<P>
   As for what he thought the Fox affiliates would do in reaction
to the move, Fitzsimons said: ``I'm sure there are going to be a
lot of discussions among the stations. Everyone will be evaluating
their options.'' &QL;

MISSOURI VOTERS REJECT PLAN TO PERMIT CONCEALED GUNS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo., Kan.)  (mk) 
 By ANDREW BLUTH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Voters in Missouri have narrowly defeated the first
referendum in the nation that would have overturned a longtime ban
on concealed weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The referendum passed in all but 12 of the state's 116 counties,
but voters in St. Louis and Kansas City overwhelmingly defeated the
measure, leading to its defeat by a statewide ratio of 52-48. In
St. Louis alone, 74 percent of the votes were against the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Election officials said the 1.3 million votes cast set a state
record for voter turnout in an April election. The high turnout was
mainly attributed to activists on both sides who lobbied
relentlessly in recent weeks, saying that for the first time the
public, as opposed to politicians, would have a say in the issue.
</P>
<P>
   High-profile gun advocates like the actor Charlton Heston,
president of the National Rifle Association, made frequent visits
to the state, as did gun opponents like Sarah and James Brady, the
former press secretary for Ronald Reagan who was shot in an
assassination attempt on the former president.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton lent her voice to the campaign against
the proposition. In a recorded telephone message that backers said
was mainly aimed at women and was sent automatically to 75,000
homes statewide, the first lady said of the proposition, ``It's
just too dangerous for Missouri families.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Brady, who is chairwoman of Handgun Control Inc., a
lobbying group in Washington, called the victory ``a huge step
forward for public safety.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of putting more guns on the street is just a
disaster, and this vote shows people agree with that,'' Mrs. Brady
said. ``People in Missouri understood that this would've allowed
people to take guns into bars and stadiums and made the streets
much more dangerous. Common sense prevailed.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing broad support for a concealed weapons law among the
state's rural population, proponents played down the defeat and
vowed to continue their fight. ``You win some and you lose some,
and we've won our fair share elsewhere,'' said James Baker, the
rifle association's chief lobbyist. ``You can be sure we'll be back
in Missouri at some point, and you can be sure we're in this for
the long haul. We're not going anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign had drawn national attention and huge amounts of
resources from the rifle group, which spent close to $4 million,
more than five times what its opponents spent.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, gun opponents cited the referendum's defeat as a
major gain for their cause, saying it was part of a trend in which
they have been gaining momentum. They cited a referendum in Florida
that requires background checks for gun buyers at trade shows, and
the filing of lawsuits against gun manufacturers by New Orleans,
Chicago and other cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Election after election, referendum after referendum and poll
after poll are showing that what the gun lobby is pushing is not
what the public wants,'' Mrs. Brady said.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Clarence Harmon of St. Louis said the vote showed that
``the power of the people is greater than the power of the NRA.''
</P>
<P>
   The referendum's proponents had hoped to add Missouri to a list
of 31 states that permit concealed weapons. The Missouri
Legislature had previously passed legislation that would have
permitted concealed weapons, but Gov. Mel Carnahan, a Democrat,
vetoed the measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can be sure we will be doing everything we can to elect a
pro-gun governor in Missouri,'' said Baker, the rifle association
lobbyist. ``And I predict the citizens in Missouri will have their
right to carry concealed weapons in the not too distant future.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker said that his group and other pro-gun lobbyists would
continue to push for such laws in other states, but said that their
strategy would probably return to passing the laws through the
legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't think it makes sense to spend that kind of money
for one state's concealed weapon referendum,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Baker said immediate attention would be shifted to Colorado and
Kansas, where similar bills are likely to come out of the
Legislatures in the current sessions.

 &HT;    Geneva McDaniel, exercise fan, dies at 111
 &HT;    By Harry Thomas
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Born in the 19th century _ only 23 years after the end
of the Civil War _ Geneva O'Kelly McDaniel, 111, of Duluth caught
on early to what became a late-20th century trend _ physical
fitness.
</P>
<P>
   Asked in 1998 by a reporter for the secret of her longevity, she
replied: ``Exercise.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It keeps you fit and it's what keeps me pretty.'' After a
moment's pause she added, ``and water, lots of water. And candy.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McDaniel became a local celebrity known for teaching
aerobics well past her 100th birthday. She was featured on national
shows such as ``20/20'' and ``Late Night with David Letterman'' and
also rode in the pace car at the first Gwinnett Metro Senior
Race-Off at the Malibu Grand Prix amusement facility in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McDaniel died of pneumonia Tuesday at Briarwood Nursing
Home in Tucker. The funeral is 11 a.m. Friday at Bill Head Funeral
Home, Duluth Chapel.
</P>
<P>
   The daughter of a country doctor who died in 1957, Mrs. McDaniel
was leading 20 senior citizens in a weekday aerobics class at
Shorty Howell Park in Duluth when she was 102. Only a few years
before that, she had lead a daily exercise program at a Duluth
senior citizens center.
</P>
<P>
   That vigor earned her the attention of the national media,
especially late-night talk shows. She turned down Johnny Carson,
but appeared on Letterman's show in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think maybe she was from the last generation that had no
pesticides in their foods, the animals didn't have hormones in
them, they ate wholesome foods,'' said her daughter, Sara McDaniel
Gregory of Stone Mountain. ``Aside from that, I don't know where
her drive came from. She just would not give up.''
</P>
<P>
   Before marrying her husband and moving to Duluth, Mrs. McDaniel
_ a Walton County native _ taught briefly. Having graduated from
LaGrange Women's College as valedictorian in 1907 with a double
major in math and psychology, Mrs. McDaniel believed in education
almost as fervently as she did exercise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody ought to go to college. Women too,'' she said in a
1987 newspaper interview.
</P>
<P>
   Her daughter said that Mrs. McDaniel never forgot poems she had
learned at college. She recited several from memory at her 111th
birthday party in August.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors other than her daughter include a son, Mack Theron
McDaniel Jr. of Atlanta; seven grandchildren; and 13
great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   In lieu of flowers, the family requests contributions be made to
the First Baptist Church of Duluth, 2908 Duluth Highway, Duluth, GA
30096.

   DURRES, Albania _ The Hader family of Kosovo held a pathetic
picnic Wednesday. They ground a plastic beach umbrella into a field
of rubble, laid down their coats like blankets over the rocks, and
sat single file sharing their last bottle of water and their final,
stale loaf of bread.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street, a new tent city was already packed, and the
sign on its gate directed newly arrived refugees to the next town.
But like many others, the Haders were too exhausted to keep going
so they parked their tractor in an empty lot, creating their own
makeshift refugee camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you like a sip?'' Mehmed Hader, 34, asked, extending the
water bottle. Then he pulled it back. ``No, I'm sorry. I cannot
afford to be polite. I will save your sip so later we can wash
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Albania's stark, mountainous countryside is dotted with the
wrenching images of a displaced population. The official camps and
even the unofficial ones are safe zones for the ethnic Albanians
who fled for their lives from their villages in Kosovo. But to
outsiders they look like horrific limbo zones for refugees who are
too numb to be anxious about the future.
</P>
<P>
   At the gates of the camp here, a small boy slept fitfully on a
filthy blanket Wednesday, occasionally reaching out a dirt-caked
hand for bread crumbs and stuffing them into his mouth. It was a
chilling sight.
</P>
<P>
   Many first-time visitors to the camps, even if they have
followed the exodus on television, lose their emotional grip when
they first take in the scope and detail of the situation. One macho
young man, an Albanian immigrant from Queens, thought he was
prepared, but ended up Wednesday with his head between his knees,
crying and retching.
</P>
<P>
   Albania's rutted roads wind through an almost lunar landscape,
dotted with skeletons _ shells of gutted cars, frames of half-built
houses and frail scarecrows guarding shaggy fields. But Albania,
the poorest country in Europe, is for the moment a verdant jewel to
the quarter of a million refugees who have landed here since the
Serbs began driving them from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   It is a striking irony that this small country, whose
limitations have pushed so many Albanians to emigrate, finds itself
the safe haven for a wave of grateful refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not our home,'' said Selim Nivokazi, who stood outside a
crisp green tent in the official camp here. ``But right now it is
beautiful to us. We go knocking on doors with our empty bottles,
and the people give us water and make us welcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Their flight is far too recent for the refugees to feel bored by
empty days that stretch before them like giant question marks. Even
the children do not yet seem restless; those who are not too tired
or weak play marbles between the tents while their parents trade
horror stories with other refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our six-year-old son, they held a knife to his throat,'' one
woman, Nivokazi's cousin, said, lifting the boy's neck to show
where the blade sat.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father, an old man, they hit his eye with the butt of a
gun,'' another woman answered.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Italian relief workers who set up the five-day old refugee
camp here, some 30 miles north of Tirana, quickly found themselves
in the uncomfortable situation of turning their back on those they
could not accommodate. They had to post guards at the gate, and
issue small pink tickets to refugees who wanted to leave _ and
return _ to the compound.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 220 tents, and as soon as we put one up, it was filled
with people,'' said Marco Agnoloni, who is running the relief
effort for the Italian Government. ``At night, we took the little
kids standing outside the gate and squeezed them into tents. Now we
are set to open another site, about 5 kilometers down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Some refugees arrive directly here from the border, while others
come from Tirana, after they are kicked out of the ``Sports
Palace,'' which was meant to be a soup kitchen but turned into a
kind of transit camp for elderly and disabled refugees. An indoor
arena, the gymnasium floor is carpeted with bare mattresses, and in
the bleachers, refugees stare listlessly at those lucky enough to
be stretched out on them.
</P>
<P>
   Every once in a while, the loudspeaker announces that a local
resident is offering a room, and Kosovar refugees rush down to
appeal for the lodging. Some hoteliers have turned over all their
empty rooms.
</P>
<P>
   In the countryside, Idris Cruziery, who is 34 but looks 50,
looked all day Wednesday for someone so generous but could find
only rental rooms that he could not afford. He returned to the
rubble lot here defeated, but the faces of his family members lit
up: he had a bag with bread and sausage.
</P>
<P>
   In the lot, the Cruziery family _ and cousins _ has been living
in the uncovered wagon behind their tractor, which in Kosovo they
used for transporting animals. There are 20 of them, and at night
they sleep like spoons, holding each other for warmth. The children
cough and cry until the darkness lifts. For five days, they have
not left the wagon, except to use the rubble as a bathroom; there
is not even a scrubby bush to hide behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can only wonder how long we will survive like this,'' said
one of the cousins, Floria Masraka. ``We don't know what to do
except wait for someone to come and tell us what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Masraka's 85-year-old grandmother, a brown scarf tied at
her chin, cried out, ``Is there a God?''
</P>
<P>
   No one answered her, but her great-granddaughter said, ``Look,
an ice cream man!''
</P>
<P>
   Operating out of a supermarket cart, a local entrepreneur was
scooping out cones for the refugee children, many of whom still
wore the pajamas and slippers they had fallen asleep in on the
night they were chased from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   The man was selling them: 10 cents each, a special deal, he
said, because he felt bad for the Kosovar people.

TANDY CHIEF EXPECTED TO TAKE JUSTIN INDUSTRIES REINS
</HEADLINE>
 CEO-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MITCHELL SCHNURMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ In a move that would involve two of Fort
Worth's signature companies, Justin Industries intends to name
Tandy Chairman John Roach to oversee its transition to a new era,
sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Roach, 60, would step in for retiring Chairman John Justin,
whose company has struggled with stagnating profits while waiting
to designate a successor to Justin, 82.
</P>
<P>
   The move would return Roach to an active corporate role four
months after he retired as the longtime chief executive at Tandy
Corp., the national electronics retailer.
</P>
<P>
   Directors at Justin Industries emphasized that the appointment
has not been approved formally, a move that would require an
announcement by a company whose stock is publicly traded.
Wednesday, Roach said it is ``possible'' that the board will select
someone else to lead the organization.
</P>
<P>
   But some directors, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
board supports the plan of enlisting Roach and expects to vote at a
directors meeting April 16, the day of the annual shareholders
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Justin, who also holds the title of chief executive, announced
March 15 that he will retire at the annual meeting. He led the
company for three decades.
</P>
<P>
   Roach, who managed Tandy through tumultuous times, has been a
Justin Industries board member since 1982. He is one of three
directors named to the company's strategic planning committee,
established last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can say, with absolute certainty, that nothing is in
concrete,'' Roach said. ``If you hear anything else, it's either a
guess or conjecture.''
</P>
<P>
   Roach said he has been approached by other boards in recent
months, including one that offered him a chairman's job. He
declined to identify the company and said he is still weighing the
offer.
</P>
<P>
   Roach has said he is not interested in just sitting on boards.
He said he wants to participate only when he can have an equity
stake and make an impact.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Roach disclosed in a public filing that he had
bought 21,250 shares of Justin Industries stock, valued at about
$224,000. Previously, he owned 6,750 shares and, as a director, has
options to buy 9,000 more shares.
</P>
<P>
   Roach said he bought the additional stock in February because he
believes in the company and has been diversifying his holdings
since stepping aside at Tandy.
</P>
<P>
   He added that he recently bought shares in four energy
companies, ``and I don't expect to have a management position in
any of them.''
</P>
<P>
   If he becomes chairman of Justin Industries, Roach will not
oversee daily operations, leaving that to current executives, one
director said. But he will guide a transition that will include the
naming of a new management team and the adoption of a fresh
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Another director said the board was impressed by the succession
that occurred at Tandy under Roach's watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who brought in Len Roberts?'' the director said, referring to
the current Tandy chief executive, who is credited with
revitalizing the Radio Shack chain and turning Tandy's stock into a
high-flyer this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of him (Roberts), their whole way of doing business is
changing,'' the director said. ``Let's suppose Roach did something
like that at Justin.''
</P>
<P>
   The two companies have a long history in Fort Worth. Justin's
two primary operations, Justin Boots and Acme Brick, are both more
than a century old. Its stock is listed on the Nasdaq exchange, and
it reported sales of $440 million last year. Tandy's stock is
traded on the New York Stock Exchange, and its '98 sales totaled
$4.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies and their executives have been key players in
many civic efforts, ranging from downtown revitalization and
education initiatives to the Southwestern Exposition and Livestock
Show.
</P>
<P>
   But Justin Industries has posted stagnant sales and profits for
much of the '90s, primarily because of a downturn in its boot
business. Its stock price has plunged more than 50 percent in the
past six years while the broader stock market has been booming.
</P>
<P>
   John Justin, who worked at the company founded by his
grandfather for 61 years, is the company's largest shareholder,
with 20.2 percent of the stock.
</P>
<P>
   When he announced last month that he would step down, the
company named no successor. J.T. Dickenson, the company's
president, is 69. Edward Stout Jr., the head of brick operations,
is 73, and said this year that he will retire.
</P>
<P>
   Justin said he and the board will work on ``finalizing
management roles'' by the annual meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot comment on the selection process now,'' Justin said
this week. ``The directors will consider this issue at the board
meeting on April 16.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked about Roach, Justin said he has known him
professionally and personally for years and often admired his
record.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got off the track once or twice at Tandy, but I think he
did a good job there,'' Justin said. ``He's very familiar with our
company, because he's been a director a long time. He knows the
people we have, and he knows corporate law and proceedings.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, in a company filing, Tandy disclosed that Roach will
retire next year as chairman and director. Previously, he had not
publicly set a date for severing ties with the company.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he would leave Tandy sooner if he took the Justin
Industries post, Roach said he has held more than one chairman's
job in the past when it didn't conflict with his Tandy duties.
</P>
<P>
   Roach's career as Tandy's chief executive began in high-flying
fashion in the early 1980s, as Tandy rode the popularity of
personal computers. But beginning in the late '80s, several company
retail initiatives stumbled.
</P>
<P>
   In his final years as CEO, Roach struggled to turn around
Tandy's money-losing Incredible Universe and Computer City chains.
Incredible Universe was closed in 1997. Many Computer City stores
were closed and the rest were sold to rival CompUSA last year. From
'92 to '98, Tandy charged off more than half a billion dollars to
cover the costs of failed ventures.
</P>
<P>
   One year ago this week, Roach announced plans to step down at
the end of '98, and Roberts took on the role as the company's most
public spokesman.

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ People afflicted with vague but powerful fears
of public places are said to suffer from agoraphobia _ literally,
fear of the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   But what shall we call the creeping fear that consumer life is
subsuming all life, that commercial messages are so ubiquitous and
unceasing that they drown out other ideas?
</P>
<P>
   The recent film ``EDtv'' satirizes television and its
advertising while simultaneously serving as a vehicle for a
possibly unprecedented number of advertisements. The product plugs
are big and blatant _ cheerfully undisguised. Plugs within ads
within the story line both mock the pervasiveness of consumer life
and become part of it.
</P>
<P>
   Our capacity to consider anything too holy for commercial use is
fading fast, but hasn't entirely expired. A few people were mildly
shocked when the pope's photograph was used to market Mexican
potato chips. A weak gasp of outrage greeted news that baseball
team owners might slap ads on team uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   Even a devout free marketeer like columnist George Will
concludes that, although professional baseball games are already a
blur of commercial messages, putting ads on uniforms crosses some
invisible line into ``assaultive'' advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Some fans may fail to grasp why slapping ads on players differs
appreciably from computer-magic ``virtual'' ads that make
television viewers think they're seeing ads on a ballpark fence. Or
the ads that actually are on the fence or the scoreboard. Or within
the stadium name.
</P>
<P>
   A major beer manufacturer gives money to the cash-strapped Texas
Parks and Wildlife Department, which in turn advertises the beer.
That's kicked off a controversy, but not about the propriety of
using public resources to advertise a product. The debate focuses
on the propriety of advertising a particular product _ beer _ to
hunters, fishers and recreaters who may be under-age and who may
damage themselves and other outdoorsfolk after consuming this
particular product.
</P>
<P>
   Schools, too, are brand-loyalty training centers. Channel One
provides free television sets and ``newscasts'' filled with product
advertising. Fast-food brands take over college dorm food lines and
public school cafeterias. Beverage makers vie to be the
``official'' school drink and mark their territory _ the students,
the stadiums, etc. _ with their logo.
</P>
<P>
   Are we surprised that per capita milk consumption by children
has plummeted in recent decades while soda consumption has soared,
to something like 51 gallons a year per person? Are we shocked that
so many children ``choose'' unhealthy diets?
</P>
<P>
   Hucksterism is now part of the academic curriculum.
``Information kits'' and ``curriculum units'' allow Kellogg to
teach nutrition, the coal foundation and the oil refiners to teach
environmentalism and Campbell Soup to teach science.
</P>
<P>
   The latest development is slipping product plugs into textbooks.
The Texas PTA was horrified to discover among state-approved texts
a McGraw-Hill math text packed with corporate logos and product
plugs: toys, franchise food, snack food, theme parks, television
shows, athletic shoes.
</P>
<P>
   The PTA's legislative action director, Karen Miller, remarked
that the ``Three Rs'' of the traditional classroom are being
replaced by the ``Three Cs.'' That's commercialism, consumerism and
classism.
</P>
<P>
   A spot check indicates that about one-fourth of Texas districts
are picking the ad-packed math book, according to Debbie Graves
Ratcliffe, information officer for the Texas Education Agency.
</P>
<P>
   State law allows the agency to reject textbooks for only three
reasons, she said. These involve refusal to correct errors, failure
to meet curriculum standards and improper binding. Hucksterism
isn't mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to justify brand-name plugs, if not the clear
promotional advice. Modern American life does, after all, revolve
around brand names and marketplace choices. We're ``logo-centric.''
</P>
<P>
   Airports double as shopping malls, with commercials blaring from
waiting room televisions. The trip may be punctuated with a video
commercial for duty-free goods and a visit from flight attendants
peddling perfume and wristwatches.
</P>
<P>
   Concerts and museum exhibits promote their sponsors, public
buses are painted up as rolling commercial billboards, movie-goers
watch commercials on the big screen and public television's simple
sponsor mentions are gradually being ``enhanced'' into full-blown
commercials.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, Garry Trudeau saw it all coming. In a Doonesbury strip
from months ago, Coach tries to recruit a college football player
by touting the college's ``team Nike'' and its great gear. The
young player and his mother warm to the idea. ``Well,'' he says,
``I have always wanted to kick some Reebok butt.''
</P>
<P>
   Think he learned his brand allegiances in public school?

DOW AND S&AMP;P 500 SET RECORDS; FINANCIAL SHARES RALLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY JR.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Dow Jones industrial average and Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index set records Wednesday, led by a rally in
bank and brokerage stocks. The Nasdaq market, however, retreated
from its Tuesday high.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today there was a flip-flop,'' said David Dietze, president of
Point View Financial Services in Summit, N.J. ``People seemed to
want to take profits in technology and move into some of the more
traditional Dow names.''
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T, Citigroup, J.P. Morgan, American Express and IBM together
accounted for 70 percent of the 121.82-point gain in the Dow Jones
industrial average, which rose to 10,085.31, an increase of 1.22
percent. It was the Dow's third close above 10,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's index rose 9 points, to 1,326.89. The
technology-heavy Nasdaq fell 18.74 points, to 2,544.43, as
investors paused to cash in profits in some recent highfliers.
America Online, for example, slumped 9 1/2, to 158, but is still
more than nine times higher than it was in September. Yahoo fell 6
7/16, to 208 7/16, as investors awaited its earnings, which were
announced after the market closed.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo said net income rose to $16.4 million, or 7 cents a share,
up from $3.3 million, or 2 cents a share, in the quarter a year
earlier. Shares of Yahoo surged as much as $8.5625, to $217, in
after-hours trading.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a rush for the tried and true names,'' said Richard
Sichel, chief investment officer at Bryn Mawr Trust Co. ``People
were saying let's step in and look at something that's not selling
at a stratospheric price-earnings ratio.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts, including Thomas Galvin of Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette, said they were cheered by the fact that relatively few
companies have warned of earnings shortfalls as the spring
reporting season starts and by new-found stability in the bond
market.
</P>
<P>
   Widespread expectations of a cut in European interest rates on
Thursday also seemed to fuel Wednesday's gains in financial stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup jumped 4 11/16, to 71 11/16; Chase Manhattan rose 5
1/8, to 84 3/8; J. P. Morgan increased 1/2, to 127 7/16; American
Express climbed 3 3/16, to 126 7/8; Charles Schwab 8 3/4, to 116,
Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette rose 5 11/16, to 78, and Merrill Lynch
increased 5 3/8, to 96 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   Alcoa, reporting higher-than-expected profits, gained 2 15/16,
to 44, and Scott &AMP; Stringfellow reiterated its ``strong buy''
recommendation. But General Motors disappointed the market by
announcing 2 percent lower March sales and the stock skidded 4 3/8,
to 86 11/16 after having climbed 3 1/2 on Tuesday. Ford Motor rose
2 1/2, to 60 3/4.
</P>
<P>
   Besides GM, the only Dow stock to lose more than a point was
Philip Morris, which fell 1 3/16, to 33 9/16, after touching a
52-week low. The stock, depressed by tobacco litigation, now sells
at just over 10 times its projected earnings for this year and
yields 5.24 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Major Nasdaq decliners were MCI Worldcom, 3 9/16 lower at 86;
Oracle, down 2 1/4, to 21 7/16, and Amazon.com, down 7 1/2, to 175
3/8. Microsoft eased 3/4, to 93 5/16.
</P>
<P>
   European markets were broadly higher with the London's FTSE-1000
setting a new high of 6,473.2, after rising 57.9 points, or
nine-tenths of 1 percent. Brazil's Bovespa jumped 3.26 percent, and
Hong Kong, which traded for the first time since April 1, rose 4.89
percent.

CYPRIOT LEADER GETS NATO APPROVAL TO ESCORT U.S. SOLDIERS OUT OF
BELGRADE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By ELIZABETH BECKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The acting president of Cyprus has been given safe
passage by NATO to fly to Belgrade Thursday morning to try to bring
home the three American soldiers who were captured by Serbian
forces near the Kosovo border last week.
</P>
<P>
   Spyros Kyprianou, 66, the acting Cypriot president and speaker
of its Parliament, will fly from Athens aboard an airplane provided
by the Greek government, said Erato Kozakou-Marcoullis, the Cypriot
ambassador to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Kyprianou is not going to negotiate their release but only
to pick them up on a humanitarian mission,'' Kozakou-Marcoullis
said.
</P>
<P>
   A fervent critic of the NATO air strikes, Kyprianou conceived
this plan several days ago and then worked with the Yugoslav
ambassador to Cyprus to persuade Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic to accept it. On Tuesday, Kyprianou received word from
the Yugoslav Embassy in Nicosia that his plan to bring the three
servicemen out of their imprisonment in Belgrade had been approved.
</P>
<P>
   If the plan succeeds, Kyprianou will fly into Belgrade on
Thursday, pick up the three servicemen and then fly them to
Nicosia, where they would be handed over to the American
ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   If Milosevic releases the soldiers, it would be his second peace
gesture of the week. On Tuesday he announced a cease-fire that was
rejected by NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the capture of the servicemen on March 31, Serbian
television showed film of Staff Sgt. Andrew A. Ramirez, 24, of Los
Angeles; Staff Sgt. Christopher J. Stone, 25, of Smiths Creek,
Mich., and Specialist Steven M. Gonzales, 21, of Huntsville, Texas.
They were visibly bruised and battered.
</P>
<P>
   The three, part of a U.N. mission in Macedonia, were on a patrol
along the Kosovo border when they were captured.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Serb leaders said they would place the three men on
trial, but they later relented and said the Americans would be
treated as prisoners of war.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the White House and the Pentagon were cautious
Wednesday about the possibility that the Cypriot mission would
succeed. National Security Adviser Sandy Berger said that the
administration ``would welcome the release'' of the servicemen.
</P>
<P>
   As a country outside of NATO, Cyprus has not been part of the
allied air war and has been able to maintain its traditionally
close ties to Yugoslavia, rooted in the shared Orthodox Christian
faith.
</P>
<P>
   According to Kozakou-Marcoullis, the Cypriot leader hoped to
leave Athens Thursday between 7 and 9 a.m. He would be flying with
a member of his Cabinet but few other officials. No journalists
would be aboard, the ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
   Ioannis Kasoulides, foreign minister of Cyprus, said by phone
Wednesday night that he did not believe Belgrade had demanded a
cease-fire or that Kyprianou had requested one.
</P>
<P>
   He also expressed more caution than the confident Kyprianou. ``I
will wait until I see the three soldiers with the speaker of the
House here in Cyprus before being jubilant,'' he said.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Facing his biggest diplomatic challenge as China's
premier, Zhu Rongji arrived here Wednesday intent on surprising his
hosts.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese leaders, particularly on state visits abroad, tend to be
reserved, stiff and sometimes pompous, as if having too much fun
might betray a weakness for Western pleasures. Zhu might be
expected to follow the script. He said his aides had warned him,
after all, that he faces a ``snake pit' of hostility during his
nine-day tour of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But, testing an old axiom of American politics, Zhu is trying to
fight venom with wit. The 70-year-old premier, with his poker face
and acute timing, can be funny, especially when no one in the
audience expects him to be. In the end, that pleasant surprise
might do more to soften popular American views of China than
Beijing's offer to import more American oranges.
</P>
<P>
   When Zhu combines a wry and sometimes slightly off-color sense
of humor with his fat rolodex of ``friends'' in American political
and business circles, he can sound more like a candidate for
Congress than a Communist Party cadre.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, shortly after his arrival at Los Angeles, he
detailed trade concessions China has offered as part of
negotiations to win entry into the World Trade Organization,
highlighting one that has been of particular interest to his
Californian hosts: lifting China's ban on imports of citrus fruit.
Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who has known Zhu since the two were mayors
_ Zhu of Shanghai and Ms. Feinstein of San Francisco _ has
regularly complained about the ban.
</P>
<P>
   ``California has a woman who comes each year to China,'' Zhu
said. ``Every time she raises the same old issue about citrus
fruit.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, pausing a beat, he added, ``Thank God, from now on she
will never raise it again!''
</P>
<P>
   A short time later, he tackled allegations that China had
obtained military secrets from a spy at an American nuclear
research laboratory, one of the latest irritants in U.S.-China
relations. Describing plans for China's celebration next October of
50 years of Communist rule, Zhu said China is preparing a grand
military review and exhibitions of its latest weaponry.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I want to explain to you in advance that these weapons
were made by China itself, not stolen from America,'' he said,
eliciting giggles from his luncheon guests. The Chinese army, he
added, will consider stenciling on the sides of its missiles the
words: ``Made in China, not in U.S.A.''
</P>
<P>
   The jokes, of course, are purely style. China's critics will
almost certainly view Zhu's humor as a ploy to evade addressing the
substance of their concerns, whether about human right abuses,
unfair trade practices or pilfering of American nuclear secrets.
</P>
<P>
   But at what are expected to be tough talks this week in
Washington, Zhu's relaxed demeanor could help break the tension.
The idea, suggested one senior Chinese aide traveling with the
premier, is that a few jokes can leaven the impressions of ordinary
Americans and make critics seem dogmatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the people who hate China in this country are very
severe,'' the aide said. ``So we will be lighthearted.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In China, Zhu is better known for bluntness than for humor.
China's unelected leaders do not generally view politics as
entertainment. They hardly ever make fun of themselves in public, a
staple of Zhu's jokes when he addresses Western audiences.
</P>
<P>
   In fact the premier is not widely considered to be an eloquent
speaker in the Chinese context. He rarely uses the flowery couplets
and rhythmic idioms that constitute oral excellence in the
classical Chinese sense, preferring to delve into his subject
directly, to name names, to reach pointed conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   He even seems a little reckless, given China's periodic
political purges, when he speaks without notes. In reality,
although he comes across as spontaneous, aides say Zhu often
practices laboriously before important events, using
English-speaking underlings as a trial audience for rehearsals in
his own near-fluent English. He times his jokes and polishes
English phrases so he can deliver them to maximum effect, they say.
</P>
<P>
   Describing steps he is taking to fix China's troubled stock
market, Zhu told a crowd of Chinese-Americans on Tuesday evening
how he had courted Andrew Sheng, the head of Hong Kong's securities
regulatory office, to take up a similar post in Beijing. Zhu said
he had told Sheng that he could hire other overseas Chinese to
staff the office. China would guarantee them the same salaries they
make abroad.
</P>
<P>
   When Sheng pointed out that mainland China has an income-tax
rate several times higher than Hong Kong's, meaning salaries would
actually have to be much higher, Zhu said, he waved his
administrative wand to give his overseas brethren a break.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them they could skip paying taxes,'' the premier said
in Chinese. ``But keep this to yourselves or my American friends
will be angry.''
</P>
<P>
   Zhu also had a message for his American hosts.
</P>
<P>
   While he said that his boss, the president and Communist Party
leader, Jiang Zemin, loves Western-style opera, Zhu has other
ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jiang likes it,'' Zhu said, ``but if you bring me to see any,
I'll just take a nap.''

FACING REJECTION, MILSTEIN WITHDRAWS OFFER FOR REDSKINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Howard Milstein on Wednesday withdrew his group's
debt-laden, $803 million offer to buy the Washington Redskins from
Jack Kent Cooke's estate, after three months of occasionally
contentious wrangling with the National Football League.
</P>
<P>
   When Milstein made a final plea to the league's full ownership
in the early afternoon, the New York real estate magnate knew that
he faced rejection if he did not withdraw. The league's finance
committee had already deadlocked on his group's financing package,
3-3, and it was unlikely that the 31 owners would approve the bid
if the finance committee did not.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the four and a half hour finance committee meeting,
Milstein stayed in his hotel room, occasionally wrestling with his
advisers over whether to withdraw, said one person who discussed
the situation with him. Several times, John Zuccotti, a legal
counselor to the Milstein family, was summoned to the owners'
meeting room to answer questions.
</P>
<P>
   In a calm speech, Milstein reiterated why his bid should have
been approved, but conceded the owners' right to choose their
partners and agreed that if they felt he should withdraw he would.
When he left, the owners voted by 28 to 2 (with an abstention) to
accept his withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   Milstein rushed into a waiting limousine, but left behind a
group statement that said, ``In the end, we complied with all the
league's stated requirements and agreed to all of the league's
additional conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``The record will show that we conducted ourselves in
an honest, forthright and courteous manner _ in short _ as
gentlemen.''
</P>
<P>
   The NFL has never directly rejected a prospective owner, but has
persuaded candidate to drop out, if there were not enough votes for
approval.
</P>
<P>
   Wellington Mara, the co-owner of the New York Giants, said, ``I
guess there was a sense of relief _ not that he withdrew _ but that
the issue is settled.'' Tom Benson, the New Orleans Saints owner
and a staunch finance committee opponent of Milstein's, said, ``It
worked out just great.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Redskins still face ownership uncertainty. The Cooke
estate will restart the sale process and John Kent Cooke, the late
owner's son, will continue to oversee the team.
</P>
<P>
   Cooke, who bid $680 million for his father's sports legacy,
could bid again, as could Daniel Snyder, a Bethesda, Md.,
businessman, who was a partner in Milstein's group.
</P>
<P>
   Whether any prospective buyer will pay as much as $803 million
is uncertain, especially after the difficult process that led to
Milstein's departure.
</P>
<P>
   The Milstein bid, the largest ever made for a United States
sports franchise, was in deep trouble Tuesday night when NFL
commissioner Paul Tagliabue met with several finance committee
members and Zuccotti. Tagliabue said the bid lacked the votes for
approval and an exit strategy was formed for Milstein, his brother
Edward and Snyder.
</P>
<P>
   The key element of the plan is for the league to recover a $30
million non-refundable deposit that the Milstein group paid the
Cooke estate in exchange for a vow by Milstein not to sue the
league.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue and Robert Kraft, the chairman of the finance
committee and owner of the New England Patriots, described the
non-refundable deposit as an offensive term.
</P>
<P>
   ``A number of owners felt negatively about that,'' Kraft said.
``We want to pick our own partners.''
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue said, ``It was a penalty that wasn't justified.''
</P>
<P>
   The league disliked having the estate sell the team, but it had
no choice. It was rebuffed by the estate's trustees when it asked
to be presented with two prospective owners for approval. The
league wanted to be able to consider John Kent Cooke's bid, and
perhaps find a way to keep the team in the Cooke family.
</P>
<P>
   But the owners were presented only with the Milstein bid. Their
queasiness about embracing it centered on the steep level of bank
borrowing it would have required. They never accepted Milstein's
intention, at first, to borrow as much as $400 million against his
real estate assets, which were deemed not liquid, and not easy to
sell if the loan fell into default.
</P>
<P>
   A financing change made last week, in which Paul Milstein,
Howard's father, agreed to lend him $125 million, and not sue his
son if the loan was not paid, was deemed insufficient by the
owners. Paul Milstein also agreed to lend Edward $25 million.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue said the owners resistant to the Milstein group balked
at regarding the $150 million from the elder Milstein as equity,
and were worried that only $50 million in cash was in the deal, all
from Snyder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think of JFK, who was very well to do but always had little
cash in his pocket,'' said Kraft, who was in favor of the Milstein
financing package despite the large amount of debt. ``This group
has tremendous net worth, but most of it is illiquid or in
partnerships.''
</P>
<P>
   Other factors that entered into considering Milstein included
his litigious reputation, and his troubled 15-month tenure, with
Edward, as the half-owner of the Islanders.
</P>
<P>
   The team's legal wars with Nassau County and SMG, the Nassau
Coliseum landlord, its slashed payroll and miserable record were
not viewed with admiration.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue was pursued fairly or unfairly,'' said Jerry Jones,
the Dallas Cowboys owner, who supported Milstein. ``It was viewed
as a past sports involvement and negative issues were brought up.''
</P>
<P>
   Milstein was quiet yesterday about selling the 45 percent stake
in the Islanders that he and his brother own. If he had been
approved to own the Redskins, he would have been required to sell
the team. Now, he is likely to sell, but unlikely to break even.
The Milsteins and Steven Gluckstern paid $195 million last year for
the Islanders and the hockey team's cable television contract. &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The crisis in Kosovo is causing rifts in both
political parties and changing how both parties approach military
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans, who were internationalists committed to
defeating and containing the Soviet Union during the Cold War, are
now far more divided in their foreign policy views. Sen. John
McCain of Arizona, who is seeking the presidential nomination, has
been staking out the view that having entered the war, NATO must
now prevail, and be prepared to use ground troops if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   BUt a number of Republicans remain sharply critical of the NATO
operation. ``A lackluster air campaign has given the Serb dictator
Milosevic time to achieve most of his strategic goals in Kosovo,''
Sen. John Ashcroft of Missouri said this week, referring to the
Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic. He said President Clinton
should continue to resist committing ground troops ``particularly
given the way the operation in the Balkans has been managed to this
point.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, where the majority of Democrats opposed President
Bush's decision to wage the Gulf War eight years ago, most _ though
not all _ Democrats are rallying behind Clinton's air war against
Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me the sensible thing now is what NATO is trying
to do,'' said Rep. Dick Gephardt, the House minority leader.
``Cumulatively over time this thing will have a good effect.''
</P>
<P>
   On ground troops, he said, ``I withhold judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats like Rep. Ellen Tauscher of California and Sen.
Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey have gone further than Clinton,
saying that ground troops may be necessary.
</P>
<P>
   But one Democratic leader is harshly critical of the president
and his foreign policy team.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the outset, this operation never had more vision than the
next day,'' Sen. Robert Torricelli of New Jersey said. He said the
acceleration of the Serbian campaign against ethnic Albanians
should have been anticipated. ``There are no questions being asked
now that were not asked in advance of this operation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think President Clinton has been very poorly served by his
foreign policy advisers,'' he said, adding that he would oppose any
commitment of ground forces to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   So far the air campaign has been waged across the congressional
recess, keeping this debate from reaching a crescendo. The
administration is preparing for three days of briefings to build
support for its Kosovo policy as soon as the House and Senate
return next week. Defense Secertary Wiliam Cohen also brought
members of Congress with him to Brussels this week.
</P>
<P>
   To some degree, the party positions reflect the fact that
partisanship even infects military actions. ``Depending on who's
president, people will switch position,'' said Barbara A. Bardes, a
professor of political science at the University of Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   But the political divisions also reflect uncertainties over
America's role in a world no longer defined by the cold war. Both
parties are grappling to define the nation's vital interests and
responsibilities as the one remaining superpower.
</P>
<P>
   A quarter of a century after the liberal anti-war forces behind
Geerge McGovern in 1972 called on America to come home from
Vietnam, it is by and large the Democrats right now who are most
ardently embracing intervention. In the House and Senate votes last
month, nearly all of them backed U.S. involvement in Kosovo. Some
figures traditionally on the left say it is because of the nature
of this war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oil versus human beings,'' said Rep. David Bonior, the House
minority whip who opposed U.S. involvement in the Gulf War but does
not shy away from the deployment of ground forces in Kosovo. ``I
just think Milosevic is a person who is bent on extinguishing
people and I think we need to do everything we can militarily to
confront that.''
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt, D-Mo., who also opposed the Gulf war said, ``Some of
us think our vote on the Persian Gulf war maybe wasn't the right
vote. Maybe you learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans, meanwhile, just a month ago were
trying to capitalize on their party's traditional edge in foreign
policy. Yet Kosovo has illustrated that the Republican
internationalism that predominated during the Cold War is no longer
a unifying Republican stand.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-eight of the Senate's 55 Republicans voted against the
air campaign in a nonbinding ballot on the very eve of the strikes.
And before that only 44 House Republicans voted to endorse the use
of U.S. troops as part of a NATO peacekeeping force should a peace
settlement be reached in Kosovo. An overwhelming 173 Republicans
opposed such U.S. involvement in another nonbinding vote.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Republicans like McCain, Sen. Richard Lugar of Indiana and Sen.
John Warner of Virginia remain interventionists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a butcher loose in the backyard of NATO,'' Sen.
Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., who also falls into their camp, said this
week. ``If NATO can't deal with this, are we living a charade that
there's peace and stability in Europe?''
</P>
<P>
   But other Republicans, some of whom saw the Gulf war as an
essential national responsibility, now make arguments about the
limits of U.S. power or say that it is time to reduce the American
role in Europe. And many conservatives are arguing to build up the
United States military but then use it only in cases where
America's vital interests are clearly at stake.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should not be in Kosovo,'' Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., said
Sunday, ``as we should not have been in Bosnia.'' He said such
deployments were stretching the military too thin. ``Our concern is
we should be able to defend America in the event something happens
where our strategic interests are at stake, such as in Iraq or in
North Korea. And this is just depleting and diluting our
resources.''
</P>
<P>
   With Congress in recess, the Republican leadership has remained
muted. House Republican leaders canceled a two-day fly around of
cities to promote their budget plan this week, with aides saying
they wanted to stay in their home districts during the time of
conflict. The cancellation also allowed them to maintain a low
profile on the Kosovo mission.
</P>
<P>
   But other House Republicans are speaking out. Rep. Tom Campbell
of California, an opponent of the Kosovo intervention, said he
plans to bring to the House floor under the 1973 War Powers
Resolution a measure disapproving of the use of U.S. forces in
combat in the Kosovo conflict, which would block ground troops and
also stop the air campaign. But neither the Clinton administration
nor any of its predecessors has recognized the act as
constitutional or binding.
</P>
<P>
   Under congressional rules such a resolution could get to the
floor for a vote by the end of April. Campbell is pressing for the
speaker, Dennis Hastert, to provide a more immediate vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prospect of involvement in a civil war is very troubling
to me,'' Campbell said. ``I believe that is the accurate
description of the situation.'' He said he might also try to force
a House vote on a declaration of war to see what Congress really
has the stomach for in Kosovo.

SHARES UP 18 PERCENT AS REVLON SAYS IT IF FOR SALE

<P>
   After weeks of speculation that it was about to be sold, Revlon
Inc., the cosmetics giant, said Wednesday that it was interested in
selling part or all of the business.
</P>
<P>
   Revlon shares, which advanced more than 60 percent in two days
last month on rumors that a deal was imminent, gained nearly 18
percent Wednesday, to $23.5625, after management announced that it
was conducting a ``review of strategic alternatives'' and might
sell the beleaguered maker of Revlon, Colorstay and Almay cosmetics
and personal care products.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that if the company failed to find a bidder
willing to offer a sizable premium for the entire business, the
Almay and Ultima II brands would be the most likely to be sold.
Selling those pieces would generate some of the cash needed to stop
the bleeding on Revlon's balance sheet and enable the company,
perhaps under new management, to get back on track.
</P>
<P>
   Revlon is based in New York and is controlled by the billionaire
Ronald O. Perelman, who has an 83 percent stake in the company.
Neither he nor George Fellows, the president and chief executive,
was available for comment, according to representatives of Revlon
and of Perelman's holding company, MacAndrews &AMP; Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   Revlon, which Perelman acquired in a leveraged buyout in 1985,
is sagging under $1.7 billion in debt. It has also faced weakening
demand as drugstore chains in this country have consolidated and
pared inventory and as international competition has grown more
intense from companies like L'Oreal SA of France, maker of
Maybelline products. Revlon has been scrambling for ways to shed
the debt and increase profitability.
</P>
<P>
   In a terse statement, the company said Wednesday that it had
retained Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. and Lazard Freres &AMP; Co. LLC to assist
in reviewing options for maximizing shareholder value.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alternatives to be reviewed will include the possible sale of
one or more businesses of the company, in which event the company
anticipates that the proceeds would be used to pay down
indebtedness,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Shaum, a fixed-income analyst who follows the company for
SG Cowen &AMP; Co., said, ``There are a number of very large
multinational companies that I think would be interested in the
Revlon name.''
</P>
<P>
   Two widely mentioned as possible takers are the Dutch company
Unilever NV, which makes Elizabeth Arden cosmetics, and the Procter
&AMP; Gamble Co. in Cincinnati, the consumer products giant that makes
Cover Girl cosmetics.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Unilever had only a small presence in drugstores
and thus would not face antitrust problems. It would also be a good
fit, they said, because it would combine Revlon's strong
international brand name with Unilever's vast international
distribution. P&AMP;G is seen as a more unlikely buyer for the entire
company because it would almost certainly run into antitrust
problems.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sales of cosmetics companies typically command prices that are
between one and a half and two times sales. Revlon would probably
get ``in the range of $30 to $50'' a share, said Tim Drake, an
analyst with the Banc One Corp., which with about 330,000 shares is
Revlon's fifth-largest shareholder.
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts and industry experts said, however, that although
the Revlon name was certainly worth a premium, the company might
have difficulty getting it because potential buyers would be aware
that management is eager to reduce the debt and that Perelman is
probably looking to unload some if not all of his investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``They look troubled now,'' said Allan G. Mottus, publisher of
The Informationalist, a trade publication. ``It's always easier to
sell a company that doesn't look troubled.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, for the fourth quarter of 1998, Revlon said earnings
fell 82 percent on flat revenue. And in January, the company, whose
stock had declined by 60 percent over the last year before the
recent run-up, said it would dismiss 7 percent of its worldwide
work force, or about 1,200 people, to cut costs in the latest of a
number of reorganization attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Perelman has had not only declines in the value of his Revlon
investment in the last year, but also huge paper losses in some of
his other holdings. He is the one of the largest shareholders of
the Sunbeam Corp., the troubled home appliance maker whose stock
collapsed last year amid management turmoil and unexpectedly large
losses. Also last year, Perelman sold his controlling interest in
Consolidated Cigar Holdings at a loss.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, Perelman's favorite lieutenant, Jerry
Levin, the highly respected former chairman and chief executive of
Revlon, has been dispatched to Sunbeam, where he is now chairman
and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``His best executive is at Sunbeam and he has a lot wrapped up
in that thing,'' Mottus said. ``Ron's got his hands full.''
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, investors have been betting that for just that
reason, Perelman was looking for ways to increase Revlon's stock
price so he could eventually cash out.
</P>
<P>
   But until Wednesday the company had declined to comment on the
unusual stock activity, even after the New York Stock Exchange
asked management to respond to possible material developments that
might be causing the market reaction.

 S.F. Web Magazine Salon Buys the WELL, an Internet Community
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Dan Fost &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
It's the feel-good Internet story of the year: Salon.com, the San
Francisco online magazine, announced yesterday that it has acquired
the WELL, a pioneering online community based in Sausalito, for an
undisclosed sum.
</P>
<P>
   WELL members, a notoriously cantankerous bunch, were
surprisingly enthusiastic in their initial reactions. Their online
postings yesterday heaped praise on the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a GOOD change, a GREAT change _ I couldn't wish for
anything better for the WELL. Absolutely a great fit. Bravo!'' one
member wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Salon bought the WELL from its owner Bruce Katz, who in the past
has felt the arrows of the WELL membership. Even Katz was heartened
by the plaudits piling up: ``This is a tough crowd,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition pairs up two of the more literary-minded locales
on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Salon fancies itself ``an upscale America Online,'' in the words
of President and Publisher Michael O'Donnell. It was founded in
1995 by former staffers of the San Francisco Examiner and is
unusual on the Web because of its long thoughtful commentary on a
wide range of issues, including politics, technology, books,
parenting, travel and health.
</P>
<P>
   The WELL sponsors more than 200 online ``conferences'' where
people can discuss everything from the news in Kosovo to the
Grateful Dead. The WELL, which will mark its 14th anniversary this
year, predates any other Internet chat service, but it never quite
lived up to its economic potential.
</P>
<P>
   In the lovefest that followed yesterday's announcement, Katz
called Salon ``the perfect ones to take it over,'' and WELL
Director Gail Ann Williams said members were ``dancing on the
keyboards.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the elation stems from the common ground and similar
sense of purpose, although some of it is no doubt due to the
reassurance that the WELL will continue to exist.
</P>
<P>
   WELL members nearly mutinied after Katz, the millionaire founder
of Rockport Shoes, bought half of the WELL in 1991, and then the
rest of it in 1994 for a reported total of $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   As longtime WELL member Jim Warren of Woodside, a cyberrights
activist and founder of InfoWorld magazine, put it, ``The attempt
to purchase what had been an almost anarchistic collection of
loyalists and turn it into just another business did not work
well.''
</P>
<P>
   One part of the WELL, an Internet service provider, was sold to
a Canadian firm. A software company called WELL Engaged was also
carved off, although it remains in the same Sausalito office
complex, and Katz is still chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, WELL membership slipped from more than 10,000 to
about 7,000 today.
</P>
<P>
   Salon execs see a profitable business with potential for
expansion, but since that sort of talk sparks alarm on the WELL,
they bent over backwards to reassure members that growth would only
happen in a controlled fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to dilute it,'' said Andrew Ross, Salon's vice
president of business development. ``The WELL is very protective of
itself, and understandably so.''
</P>
<P>
   The WELL's employees _ the equivalent of eight full-timers _
will remain in Sausalito. People pay $10 or $15 per month for
memberships, and the business runs a little better than break-even,
Katz said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Salon isn't making any money, Katz said it has more
marketing muscle, with a national ad campaign in the works, and
deeper pockets. Its investors include Adobe Ventures, Hambrecht &AMP;
Quist, Borders Books and ASCII, a Japanese publishing concern.
</P>
<P>
   Salon is privately held and is tight-lipped about any plans to
go public. But it did make an important change, from a stock market
perspective, this week when it changed its name from Salon Magazine
to Salon.com.
</P>
<P>
   That's because Salon finally obtained the domain name it's long
coveted _  &LR; www.salon.com. &LR;  Salon has wanted that Web address since
its founding, but a Texas hairdresser got it first and then played
hard to get.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Salon readers had to enter the more cumbersome
 &LR; www.salonmagazine.com &LR;  or  &LR; www.salon1999.com. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Salon paid an undisclosed amount of cash and stock to the hair
salon, and also turned over one of its alternate domain names,
 &LR; www.salon.net &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   ``It was annoying and really frustrating,'' trying to get the
domain name, said Salon President and Publisher Michael O'Donnell.
``We finally had to fly to Austin.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that the salon owner is a Salon shareholder, everyone gets
along. Salon's computers help host the salon's Web site, and they
share links.
</P>
<P>
   And who knows? Maybe they could develop co-branded products. Or,
as one wag on the WELL suggested yesterday, start a new venture
that could be named Hair.net.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; HERRING HIRING: &LR;  The Red Herring, a monthly magazine devoted to the
finances of high-tech companies, is tripling its online operations.
</P>
<P>
   That means doubling the size of its 12-person online news staff.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the San Francisco magazine just hired a publisher _
Ted Gramkow, who had been advertising director at Forbes ASAP.
</P>
<P>
   It's part of what Red Herring CEO Tony Perkins sees as a boom
time for the company.
</P>
<P>
   The firm was profitable last year, magazine revenues doubled,
and publishing titan Ziff-Davis invested $3 million for what
insiders say is a 10 percent stake.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Perkins says, the Herring is ready to take its brand online
_ with news, e-commerce and a host of other ambitious projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took ZDNet, Cnet and Yahoo gazillions of dollars converting
the world to use the Internet, and that was an investment I didn't
want to make,'' Perkins says. Now that the world is ready, though,
he declares: ``We want to be the technology business and investment
portal. The time is now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Herring launched an online version of the magazine about a
year ago, but it wasn't until January that it started putting
stories on its site every day.
</P>
<P>
   Now the plan is to take the site from five stories a day up to
15.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you rest, you die,'' said Rafe Needleman, the editor of Red
Herring Online.

 PG&AMP;E Fine Called Paltry
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Carol Emert &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Consumer advocates cried foul yesterday over a proposed $440,000
sanction leveled against Pacific Gas &AMP; Electric in the wake of the
debilitating December 8 blackout in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed fine, levied by the grid-operating California
Independent System Operator, equals about 0.06 percent of PG&AMP;E's
$719 million net profit last year.
</P>
<P>
   The seven-hour power outage cost the local economy an estimated
$400 million in damages, according to a report commissioned by the
California Public Utilities Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The sanction is subject to approval by the ISO's Board of
Governors and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the equivalent of a parking ticket _ it doesn't stop
anyone from letting the meter expire next time,'' said Theresa
Mueller, a deputy city attorney for San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Nettie Hoge, executive director of The Utility Reform Network,
believes that there may be a more nefarious side to the
announcement, which was made late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   She sees it as a likely power play between two regulators, the
ISO and the PUC, which has not yet decided whether to impose
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's quite possible the ISO is trying to head off a
higher sanction by the PUC ... by coming in fast and low,'' Hoge
said. Consumer advocates have criticized the ISO as an ``old-boys
network'' that is stacked with utility-industry insiders.
</P>
<P>
   The ISO, which is governed by the California Electricity
Oversight Board, a state agency, was created last year to oversee
transmission lines in the newly deregulated energy system.
Previously, only the PUC had authority over utilities.
</P>
<P>
   Hoge said the PUC is more consumer-friendly because it is
required to deliberate in open hearings and consider public
comments as it makes policy. She said the ISO's deliberations are
in private.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Winter, chief executive of the ISO, said the fine was not
designed to influence any future action by the PUC. The purpose is
to embarrass PG&AMP;E and ``get their attention'' by ``exposing the
operation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Heath, executive director of the ISO oversight board, said
the proposed fine was meant to ``get the word out that this ISO and
the state are taking the issue of liability very seriously. ...
We're putting everyone on notice that protocols will be followed,
and if there's a violation, the ISO and the state will move forward
in sanctioning those who violate the (rules).''
</P>
<P>
   Heath said the $440,000 fine was based on the U.S. Nuclear
Regulatory Commission's fee structure of $110,000 per violation. An
ISO investigation found that PG&AMP;E was negligent in four areas of
systems maintenance and procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the small fine would be effective as a deterrent,
Heath noted that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission sanction
structure is being used only as an interim baseline until the ISO
develops its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the future, we could see something more robust; I don't
know,'' Heath said. ``That will be something we'll look at from the
state side also _ we need sanctions that are adequate to deter
future violations.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Schulte, director of the PUC's consumer services division,
had no comment on the ISO's action. The PUC is just finishing its
investigation and ``we haven't even begun to think about whether
sanctions are warranted or not,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Later this month, executives from the PUC and ISO will sit down
with PG&AMP;E officials to discuss reforms PG&AMP;E needs to adopt to
prevent future transmission problems.
</P>
<P>
   The ISO's oversight board is expected to act on the sanction
proposal and forward it to FERC for final approval in the next two
months.
</P>
<P>
   If approved, the $440,000 fine will be used to defray ISO's grid
management costs, which typically are passed along to consumers.
However, Bay Area homes and businesses are unlikely to see a
noticeable change on their energy bills because the amount is
relatively small.
</P>
<P>
   PG&AMP;E spokesman Len Anderson said the company would not comment
on the ISO sanction until it has been approved by the
organization's governing board.
</P>
<P>
   He said PG&AMP;E is undergoing an extensive review of its processes
to correct the problems that led to the blackout. But, he said, the
utility would be taking corrective action regardless of sanctions
or other actions by regulators.

 &HT;    Bush says last-day surge put campaign tally at $7 million
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush said Wednesday that the
first weeks of fund raising for his presidential campaign were
about $1 million better than he initially thought.
</P>
<P>
   On March 31, the final day of the fund-raising period, Bush
announced the campaign collected about $6 million in three weeks of
dialing for dollars. On Wednesday, he said the total that will be
on federal disclosure reports due next week will top $7 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a huge surge of money on the last day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And now, Bush _ head and shoulders the fund-raising leader among
probable GOP contenders _ has his dad on the job. Former President
George Bush was the featured speaker Tuesday evening at a Phoenix
fund-raising event that attracted more than 200 people at a $1,000
apiece.
</P>
<P>
   The event, first of the Bush presidential campaign, was a
political incursion into the hometown of two GOP rivals. Arizona
Sen. John McCain and former Vice President Dan Quayle both have
campaign bases in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle spokesman Jonathan Baron declined to comment on the
significance of Bush's ability to raise money on the former vice
president's adopted home turf.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Bush and former Vice President Quayle have a very
good relationship,'' said Baron. ``We are pleased the former
president was visiting the state. We expect candidates to campaign
everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The elder Bush had kind words for Quayle, a former Indiana
senator, last week during an Indianapolis fund-raising event for
that state's Republican Party. The ex-president said he remained
proud of his former vice president and said Quayle, ``took an
unfair pummeling from the very day I recommended him for that
job.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor plans to hit the fund-raising trail shortly after
the legislative session ends May 31, though he will have to spend
some time in Austin for the 20-day post-session period in which he
must sign or veto bills.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to having his father's occasional help, Bush is
working on tapping into the well-heeled and increasingly political
high-tech community. Next week's parade of visitors to Austin will
include a team of San Jose-based executives led by Floyd Kvamme, a
leading Silicon Valley venture capitalist. He was among 55
high-tech executives who ran an ad in the San Jose Mercury-News
this week urging Bush to seek the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The overall fund-raising effort _ aimed at raising the more than
$45 million it would take to be able to skip federal matching money
and spending caps it brings _ is dependant upon ``pioneers'' who
sign up to quickly bring in $100,000 each. Federal law limits
individual contributions to $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   So far, more than 200 ``pioneers'' have signed on with Bush.
Among those involved at high levels are longtime Bush friends
Donald Evans of Midland (the campaign finance chairman), Brad
Freeman of Los Angeles and the 13 Republican governors who have
endorsed Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In San Antonio, where he addressed a conference of charter
school operators, Governor Bush said his fund-raising success is an
early and important indicator of the viability of his presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first indication of solid support is whether or not I can
raise money,'' Bush said. ``And it appears that I'm able to do
so.''
</P>
<P>
   On issues related to his current job, the governor told the
charter school officials that they are making a difference for
Texas students. Charter schools are state-funded campuses that are
free of many state regulations. There are now 88 in Texas. Next
fall, there will be 167.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charter schools are working,'' Bush told the conference. ``We
need more of them. We must not be afraid to experiment and have
social entrepreneurship flourish.''
</P>
<P>
   After the speech, Bush re-ignited his call for similar
experimentation with a voucher system pilot program that would
allow the use of state money for private school tuition.
</P>
<P>
   A Senate committee, by a single vote, has approved such a plan.
But supporters have been unable to muster the votes to get the bill
to the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is enough uncertainty that people are nervous
about it,'' said Bush. ``And that's why I think we ought to try a
limited pilot program to answer the uncertainty.''

CHINA MAY HAVE STOLEN SECRETS FOR NEUTRON BOMB DURING CLINTON
TERM 
</HEADLINE>
  (With CHINA-NUKE-CHRONO) 
(ac) 
 By JEFF GERTH and JAMES RISEN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In early 1996, the United States received a
startling report from one of its Chinese spies. Officials inside
China's intelligence service, the spy said, were boasting that they
had just stolen secrets from the United States and had used them to
improve Beijing's neutron bomb, according to American officials.
</P>
<P>
   The spy had provided reliable information in the past, and
officials said investigators took the report seriously.
</P>
<P>
   China first built and tested a neutron warhead in the 1980s,
using what American officials have said publicly was secret data
stolen from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California,
one of America's key nuclear weapons laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   But the design did not work properly. American officials say
that China's 1988 test of the neutron bomb, which kills people with
enhanced radiation while leaving buildings intact, was not
successful.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the spy was suggesting, Chinese agents had solved the
problem by coming back to the United States in 1995 to steal more
secrets. The spy even provided details of how the information was
transferred from the United States to China, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The report prompted a federal criminal investigation, but
American officials say they have found no evidence that China has
produced an improved neutron bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Berger, who is now the National Security Adviser, was
first told of a possible new theft of neutron bomb data in 1996,
according to officials who took part in the meeting or read the
highly classified materials used to prepare for it.
</P>
<P>
   The briefing, these officials said, came weeks after the FBI
gave the Energy Department a report about the spy's information.
</P>
<P>
   David Leavy, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said
that Berger and another NSC official who attended the 1996 briefing
do not believe the neutron bomb issue was mentioned. Leavy said
that Berger did not learn of the suspicions until a more detailed
briefing in July 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The spy's report arrived as American intelligence agencies were
examining a separate suspected Chinese espionage coup: the theft of
designs of America's most modern nuclear warhead, the W-88.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure of the report about the neutron bomb is
significant for several reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Clinton administration officials have portrayed
reports of China's nuclear spying as an old story.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of public statements, administration officials have
emphasized that the loss of the W-88 design occurred in the 1980s,
which was while Republicans held the White House. They have
suggested that there is no evidence Chinese nuclear spying
continued into the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   They have also said that President Clinton acted quickly in
response to concerns about security breaches at the nuclear weapons
laboratories by issuing a Presidential order in February 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Accounts by government officials about the neutron bomb case
call both assertions into question.
</P>
<P>
   According to the officials, the April 1996 briefing of Berger
included evidence of the theft of the W-88 design, the need to
increase security at the weapons laboratories and the report about
the loss of neutron bomb data.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said Berger did not tell the President or take
any further action until more than a year later, in July 1997, when
he received a more detailed briefing about the W-88 theft, the
neutron bomb and the ongoing Chinese espionage.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, Leavy said, Berger told the President about the
security weaknesses at the laboratories and China's spying. Asked
whether he mentioned the neutron bomb case, Leavy would reply only
that ``he did not detail each and every allegation.''
</P>
<P>
   A bipartisan Congressional report on China's acquisition of
United States technology includes a detailed, but still secret,
account of Beijing's efforts to obtain neutron bomb secrets,
including reports of efforts during the Clinton Presidency. But
government officials say that the Clinton administration is
resisting requests from Congress to make the more recent material
public.
</P>
<P>
   Leavy said the administration is cooperating with Congress to
declassify as much material as possible consistent with law
enforcement and intelligence requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Several agencies, including the FBI, the Central Intelligence
Agency and the Energy Department are continuing to examine the
case.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI has not identified a suspect in the case.
</P>
<P>
   The April 1996 briefing came at a critical moment in U.S.-China
relations. The Clinton administration's continuing effort to expand
commercial and diplomatic ties with China had been upset by
Beijing's test in March of missiles off the coast of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Berger has said the April 1996 briefing was not sufficiently
detailed to prompt action.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' last month, he said the
information he was told three years ago was ``very general and very
preliminary.'' In addition, he said, ``we did not have a suspect''
in the theft of the W-88 technology.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But other officials offered a different account of Berger's
briefing. The White House said it believes the briefing occurred on
April 13, 1996, but was not sure of the exact date and has no
records of what was said that day.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said the briefing was more detailed than Berger
has described and was the culmination of a five-month inter-agency
study of the W-88 theft and related issues. ``It was a pretty
specific briefing,'' one American official who was present said.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Curtis, the deputy secretary of Energy, led the Energy
Department's delegation at the White House briefing. The main
briefer was Notra Trulock, then the Energy Department's chief of
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Trulock's briefing, officials said, specifically covered the
theft of the W-88 technology and concluded that China had likely
obtained data about the miniaturized warhead, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said Berger was also told that investigators had
identified a prime suspect in the theft and would shortly turn
their information over to the FBI for a formal criminal inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Berger and Curtis agreed that the Congressional intelligence
committees would be briefed on the W-88 matter following the
referal to the FBI (Congress was informed that summer.)
</P>
<P>
   According to the officials, the 1996 White House briefing also
discussed how the stolen technology could fit into Beijing's
nuclear strategy. Trulock suggested that China could use the W-88
technology as part of a plan to rely on the mobility of
truck-launched missiles with small warheads to better survive
nuclear attacks, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the April briefing, officials said, Trulock said
there was new information that China may recently have stolen
neutron bomb data. He was referring to the spy's report, which had
been received by the Energy Department from the FBI on March 27,
1996, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The neutron bomb intelligence was ``hot off the press,'' and it
was included to warn the White House of the possibility of
continuing Chinese espionage, one official said.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis told Trulock at the meeting to follow up the neutron bomb
information with a broader inquiry into Chinese espionage efforts
at the weapons labs, one official said.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department completed an analysis of the neutron bomb
case in July 1996, and it unearthed some intriguing connections.
The study, officials said, raised the possibility that the chief
suspect in the W-88, a computer scientist in Los Alamos, had also
been involved in the transfer to China of neutron bomb secrets.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect, Wen Ho Lee, was dismissed from his job last month
after the Energy Department said he violated security regulations.
No criminal charges have been filed against him. Officials said the
FBI has investigated the Energy Department's theory but has not
been able to establish that Lee has any connection to the neutron
bomb case.
</P>
<P>
   As they investigated further, Energy Department officials
discovered that Lee had attended a classified meeting in 1992 in
which solutions to the neutron bomb's design flaw were discussed,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI, officials said, had also found that Lee had made at
least one telephone call to the scientist at Lawrence Livermore who
was suspected of having provided the Chinese with the original
neutron bomb data in the late 1970s and early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   According to the FBI's informant, Chinese officials were
boasting in 1995 about obtaining new data from the United States
but did not specifically mention the government's weapons
laboratories. American officials say the FBI has not found any
evidence linking the weapons laboratories to the suspected theft of
neutron bomb secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials said it is difficult to evaluate China's
progress on developing a neutron bomb because they have not
detected any testing of such a weapon since 1996, when Beijing
agreed to a moratorium on tests.
</P>
<P>
   The informant's report, however, was one of several pieces of
intelligence pointing to the vulnerability of the laboratories to
espionage.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1996, shortly before he left the government, Curtis
ordered a series of measures to tighten security. But the White
House was apparently not notified of Curtis's directives, most of
which were ignored or delayed by Energy Department officials.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1997 Trulock returned to the White House to present his
wider findings to Berger, who had become Clinton's National
Security Adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Berger, in turn, now says that that briefing prompted him to
inform Clinton about China's nuclear espionage and concerns about
lab security. But late last year, in a sworn reply to the select
House committee chaired by Christopher Cox, a Republican from
California, Berger said the President was not told about the
espionage until 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to explain the discrepancy, Leavy said ``after the Cox
Committee process we've remembered more.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton says he is unaware of any Chinese espionage taking place
during his administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the best of my knowledge, no one has said anything to me
about any espionage which occurred by the Chinese against the labs,
during my Presidency,'' he said at a news conference last month.
</P>
<P>
   Leavy declined to say whether Clinton has been briefed on the
intelligence about the possible theft of neutron bomb data during
his Presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, Cox and the ranking Democrat on the committee,
Norm Dicks of Washington, wrote President Clinton requesting a
meeting to discuss their report. Leavy said the White House was
working on scheduling a meeting. The committee has completed its
work but is still consulting with the administration over how much
of its final report can be made public.

 By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CUMMING, Ga. _ Forsyth County has become the fastest-growing
county in the nation for many of the reasons that attract people to
the green edges of metropolitan areas: broad back yards for patios
and swing sets, good schools, a deep lake, all just 25 miles up the
highway from the corporate towers of Atlanta's inner suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the people moving to Forsyth County know something
else about the county that sets it apart: In a metropolitan area
where blacks are 28 percent of the population, it is almost
entirely white.
</P>
<P>
   A few new residents even know of the racial violence 87 years
ago that drove almost every black out of Forsyth County. But
officially that is considered ancient history, unrelated to the
10,000 newcomers who settled here in 1998, almost all of them
white.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't feel that racism is an issue in Forsyth County
anymore,'' said Stevie Mills, the county administrator. ``There's
been a great deal of progress made, and all races are welcome
here.''
</P>
<P>
   There are indeed no signs of overt racism in the county. But
suburban development, like so many other aspects of life in the
South, is inextricably entangled in race, and distant moments of
brutality still affect how a city grows. Longtime residents and
planners who know Forsyth County well say it is not complete
coincidence that the county, recently designated by the Census
Bureau as the nation's fastest growing, is also, according to
census figures, the whitest among populous counties nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Most whites coming here are affluent professionals who share
little of the county's historical racial animus, and know little
about it. But for many people looking for a home on Atlanta's
pre-eminent growth corridor, Forsyth County's lack of diversity _
its homogeneity _ is an attraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's kind of an unspoken truism around here,'' said Phillip
Bettis, a prominent local lawyer who grew up here. ``No one wants
to say it, but I suspect some of it is true, though it's not
politically correct.''
</P>
<P>
   Douglas C. Bachtel, a demographer at the University of Georgia
who has done forecasting for the county's planning department, said
that many people who would consider themselves tolerant were in
effect benefiting from the county's racist past.
</P>
<P>
   ``The county has become an affluent suburban bedroom
community,'' Bachtel said, ``and the people moving in have high
incomes and high educational levels. They look at the school
system, and it looks like a de facto private school. They don't
have the problems that inner-city schools have, substance abuse and
crime and that kind of thing. And in the meantime, middle-class
black families would prefer to live in neighborhoods where they
feel comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Many prosperous black families have moved to the south side of
the Atlanta area, while most of the people moving to Atlanta's
northern suburbs are white. And while northern Georgia has long
been predominantly white, Forsyth County is far less racially
diverse than its suburban neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent census figures, for 1997, showed that only 39
blacks lived in the entire county, which had 75,749 people. With a
white population of 99.3 percent, Forsyth was the whitest of the
country's 600 most populous counties.
</P>
<P>
   In the year since, the county grew by 10,381 people, or 13
percent, a rate that the Census Bureau says exceeds all others.
There are no figures for how many blacks moved in, but if blacks
kept pace with the overall growth, they would have added only four
people.
</P>
<P>
   In 1912, almost all of the 1,098 blacks who lived in the county
were driven out by vigilantes after three black men were accused of
raping and killing a white woman, Mae Crow. Two of the men were
convicted and hanged; the third was lynched. Black churches and
farmhouses went up in flames, and for decades after only a handful
of blacks dared to live in the county.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, a group of civil rights marchers came to Cumming, the
county seat, to protest racism, and were attacked by several
hundred whites. Local people said the attackers were outsiders, but
blacks said the attackers were at least abetted by county
residents. A week later, a second march drew 20,000 demonstrators
to Cumming. The publicity gave the county a national reputation for
intolerance.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, black families that have moved to the Atlanta area
in large numbers have settled in adjacent counties to the east and
south but still avoid Forsyth County.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forsyth still has a negative connotation in my mind, and in
the mind of most African-Americans around here,'' said Nelson
Rivers III, the regional director of the National Association for
the Advancement of Colored People, who took part in the 1987 march.
``Just like Memphis will forever be the place where Dr. King was
assassinated, Cumming will always be known for that march.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will take quite a while before African-Americans who know
the history will be willing to move there.''
</P>
<P>
   While blacks avoid the county, most of the people who have been
extending the metropolitan area's boundaries to the north have been
white.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, no whites said that race played a role in their
decision to move to the county, and several said they had never
heard of its reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a nice place to live, and it's not far from work,''
said Stanley Travis, a computer executive who moved to a
subdivision in the south part of the county two years ago from
Memphis. ``I didn't ask anyone how many blacks live here, if that's
what you mean.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Most subdivisions in the northern part of the county have no
black residents. There are about 2,000 Hispanic residents, many of
whom work at the poultry plants that are one of the county's
principal industries.
</P>
<P>
   Racial diversity has not been high on the agenda as the county
struggles to cope with its transformation from a quiet agricultural
outpost. Traffic moves more slowly every month, and the county is
running out of places to send its sewage. Mills, the county
administrator, said the county's water system, which served 700
customers outside Cumming in 1987, now has 19,000 customers. Even
developers did not object in November when county commissioners
imposed a 16-month moratorium on rezoning agriculture land for new
development.
</P>
<P>
   Swamped with the logistics of keeping the county afloat, leaders
say they do not know what, if anything, they should do to make the
county more racially diverse. There have been no recent reports of
racial incidents, and Rivers, of the NAACP, said he knew of no
complaints that blacks had been steered away from settling there.
</P>
<P>
   Bettis, the lawyer, who was co-chairman of a human rights panel
the county established after the 1987 march, said lengthy soul
searching helped cleanse the area of intolerance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The folks that were here at the time probably overcompensate
now to be fair,'' he said. ``I think people bend over backward to
avoid any possibility of being unfair or racist. We tell people, if
you move here, you will be welcome, and you will be protected. But
we haven't had many takers.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the few blacks to move in was Joseph Mosley, who returned
to the Atlanta area from Ohio last year and decided to take
advantage of the amenities so many whites were enjoying.
</P>
<P>
   Mosley, who works in the telecommunications industry, owns a
$350,000 house in the Deer Lake subdivision, and says he has seen
no signs of bigotry. When black friends question his wisdom of
moving to Forsyth, he says he tells them they are unfairly
stereotyping whites.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't come here to teach any lessons,'' Mosley said. ``But
if my being here teaches some people about whether an
African-American can move into a community and still uphold the
standards everyone is striving for, well, then let my presence be
an example.''

DISNEY AND MIRAMAX COLLIDE OVER CHURCH ISSUES IN FILM 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ In an embarrassment for Miramax Films, its owner,
Walt Disney Co., has termed a new Miramax movie ``inappropriate''
because of content involving Roman Catholics, and has said the film
should not be released under a Disney label.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Bob and Harvey Weinstein, co-chairmen of Miramax,
announced Wednesday that they would acquire all rights to the film,
``Dogma,'' and seek to sell it to another distributor. The film,
written and directed by Kevin Smith, who made ``Clerks'' and
``Chasing Amy,'' was described by Miramax as a satire that deals
with religious issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all agreed this is the best way for the film to be
presented,'' the Weinstein brothers said in a statement announcing
that they would personally buy the negative and film rights. ``All
of us look forward to the time when audiences will be able to see
the film; it will be properly understood and viewed for film as
film's sake.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvey Weinstein said in a telephone interview Wednesday night
that Disney did not directly ask him to shelve the film. ``What
they said is, `We have a problem,''' Weinstein said. ``So we came
up with a solution.'' He expressed concern that ``Disney is too
easy a target.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why make trouble?'' he said. ``I just thought it was time to
pre-empt the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   In setting up a corporation solely to acquire the rights to the
film and sell it to a distributor, the Weinsteins said, ``We intend
to work with a distributor that shares our vision of the film.''
The brothers also said they would seek a marketing and distribution
partner ``that will fully realize `Dogma's' potential as broad
entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   One Miramax executive said that the Weinsteins, who were
triumphal this year at the Academy Awards with films like
``Shakespeare in Love'' and ``Life Is Beautiful,'' would buy
``Dogma'' for its cost, more than $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   The film has a stellar cast including Ben Affleck, Matt Damon,
Alanis Morisette, Salma Hayek, Chris Rock, Linda Fiorentino and
George Carlin. It was described by Miramax as an adult tale about a
hero joined by a band of misfits seeking to save humanity.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of Disney executives have seen the film. One, who
spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that parts of the movie
could be construed as an attack on Catholic dogma. There has been
no official comment from the church.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the criticism, the Miramax statement said, ``While
plot points and characters may be taken out of context, appearing
as if Smith is attacking organized religion, the film should be
taken as a whole: a satire from a filmmaker who himself is a
practicing Catholic with a solid foundation of love and reverence
to faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, the writer-director, said Wednesday that ``Dogma'' was
``from first to last always intended as a love letter to both faith
and God almighty.'' He added: ``It's mind-bending that as we come
to the close of this century that anyone would still attack a work
that has yet to see the light of day without having seen it
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Miramax has collided with its owner, Disney, before, but never
quite so publicly. In 1994, Miramax released a British film,
``Priest,'' about a gay Catholic priest. The film received strong
reviews, but some Catholics demonstrated against Disney in protest.
</P>
<P>
   The following year, another film, ``Kids,'' about aimless
teen-agers, was released with an NC-17 rating, meaning no one under
17 allowed. Because of the Disney stricture that the studio would
never release an NC-17 rated film, Miramax set up its own
distribution to release the movie, which was panned by critics and
failed at the box office.
</P>
<P>
   With more and more conglomerates like Seagram, Viacom and Sony
owning independent film companies, collisions have become
inevitable between the smaller companies producing unconventional
films and their more conservative parents. Last year Seagram's
studio arm, Universal, refused to release an October Film movie,
``Happiness,'' because of its sexual themes and content. The film
was released at another company.
</P>
<P>
   It is not known whether Michael Eisner, the chairman of Disney,
has seen ``Dogma.'' But other top company executives at the
Burbank, Calif., headquarters saw the film recently. The one who
spoke on condition of anonymity said he was dismayed by it. He said
the film was ``inappropriate for all of our labels.''
</P>
<P>
   Paying tribute to the Weinsteins, Smith said, ``As per usual,
Bob and Harvey are the only ones willing to stick by us or back our
goofy little flicks.'' Smith applauded their ``great courage,'' and
said, ```Dogma' is in no way blasphemous or worthy of the mild
controversy that seems to be brewing around it.''

   INTERNET HOAX ROILS SHARES OF PAIRGAIN TECHNOLOGIES
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Pairgain Technologies shot up more than 30 percent
after someone using a personal Web site designed to look like an
Internet page of Bloomberg News posted a fake news report that said
the company was being taken over. The report spread to a Yahoo
message board and then to other sites frequented by stock traders.
By midday, the stock retreated as the takeover story was debunked.
</P>
<P>
   The hoax, which is being investigated by the Securities and
Exchange Commission and the Nasdaq stock market, shows the power of
Internet chat rooms and day traders, who make rapid-fire trades in
and out of stocks in which they can easily move the price.

   MARCH SALES FELL 2.2 PERCENT FOR GM
</P>
<P>
   General Motors missed out on sizzling vehicles sales in March,
reporting that its car and truck sales fell 2.2 percent from those
in the month a year earlier, largely because it could not keep up
with demand for its full-size pickup truck. Analysts had expected a
gain of 2 percent. Shares of GM fell $4.375, to $86.6875.
</P>
<P>
   YAHOO POSTS SOLID EARNINGS
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo, whose Internet sites range from chat rooms to search
services, said that its first-quarter earnings rose fivefold and
revenue almost tripled, buoyed by growth in advertising and
commissions from online sales. Shares of Yahoo surged as much as
$8.5625, to $217, in after-hours trading.

   DISNEY ESCHEWS FILM FROM MIRAMAX

   Walt Disney, the owner of Miramax Films, has termed a new
Miramax movie ``inappropriate'' because of content involving Roman
Catholics and said it should not be released under a Disney label.
The co-chairmen of Miramax said they would acquire rights to the
film and seek to sell it to another distributor.

   APPEAL URGED IN BANANA DISPUTE
</P>
<P>
   The powerful French farmers' union urged the European Union to
appeal a ruling by the World Trade Organization that the system for
importing and marketing bananas, which favors imports of bananas
from former European colonies over nations in Latin America, would
have to be changed. Sir Leon Brittan, the European Trade
commissioner, said the European Union reserved the right to appeal
the ruling.

   FED TEA LEAVES POINT TO RATE RISE
</P>
<P>
   Minutes from the Federal Reserve's policy-setting meetings in
November, December and February indicate that the Fed has all but
discarded hope that the economy will slow significantly. That
increases the likelihood of a Fed rate rise. Market Place.

   CONSULTANTS SPLIT OFF FROM DELOITTE
</P>
<P>
   Deloitte &AMP; Touche is expected to announce that a group of about

   VENTURE SEEKS TO BYPASS MTV

<P>
   At first glance, the joint Internet venture between Universal

record companies are trying to cut out are the traditional forms of

PHILIP MORRIS DISMISSES THREE TOP MILLER BEER EXECUTIVES
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Moving to improve the sagging fortunes of its Miller
Beer unit, which has lost market share and volume in recent years,
Philip Morris dismissed three top Miller executives Wednesday,
including the chief executive and the head of marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the dismissals of John MacDonough, the chief
executive, as well as Jack Rooney, the company's vice president for
marketing and Christopher Moore, the vice president for sales,
reflected Philip Morris' deep unhappiness with a series of
advertising campaigns that failed to ignite consumer interest in
the Miller brands.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among them was the series of ads featuring a character
called ``Dick the creative superstar,'' which came to be seen as
tiresome and off the mark. Also unsuccessful was a subsequent
campaign for Miller Lite that tried to be edgy and appeal to
20-something beer drinkers, who are considered the best hope of the
stagnant domestic beer industry, with references to animals,
bathroom humor and offbeat characters. At the same time, the ads
did not mention the brand.
</P>
<P>
   One of the latest campaigns for Miller Lite, featuring ex-sports
stars and celebrities, also missed the target. ``It's kind of like
watching paint dry,'' said Jennifer Solomon, an analyst who covers
the beer industry for Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   And a recent campaign was yanked even before it made it on air,
after wholesalers were shown the ads and gave them two thumbs down.
The incident was first reported in Advertising Age last month.
</P>
<P>
   The proof was in the pitcher. Miller's volume fell last year to
41.7 million barrels, from 42.5 million barrels in 1997, and beer
distributors became enraged with the company's management after one
misstep followed another.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the advertising gaffes, Miller initiated a price war
with its archrival, Anheuser-Busch, the maker of Budweiser. Prices
fell to record low levels, and while Miller sought to take volume
and market share away from Budweiser with the costly strategy. It
was Budweiser that prevailed, by matching the pricing and coming
out with ads that were generally seen as funnier and more
effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this context, with Miller not doing things right and Bud
doing things right, you see what happens,'' said Emanuel Goldman, a
global consumer products analyst for Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   MacDonough, 57, came to Miller exuding promise. He had been the
brand manager for Budweiser at Anheuser who told a folksy story
about leaving the company because he was not a member of the Busch
family. According to the story, August Busch 3rd asked what he
could do to persuade MacDonough to stay. MacDonough replied,
``Adopt me.''
</P>
<P>
   He will be replaced by John D. Bowlin, 48, who has been the
president and chief executive of Kraft Foods International, another
Philip Morris unit, since 1996. Bowlin was the president and chief
operating officer at Miller from August 1993 until December 1994.
``He was very well liked among the Miller distributors,'' said Eric
Shepard, executive editor of Beer Marketers Insights, a trade
journal.
</P>
<P>
   Since then Bowlin has worked at Kraft's domestic unit as well as
heading up the international business. In both Kraft jobs, Bowlin
earned a reputation as a fixer who could take troubled businesses
and set them back on course, something Philip Morris seemed to be
hoping for in Miller's case as well.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Mikulay, 47, and James Mortensen, 41, two executives from
Philip Morris USA, the domestic tobacco division, will head up,
respectively, Miller's marketing and sales. The appointments were
seen as a sign of Philip Morris' eagerness to correct the slump at
Miller.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a management change we are making in order to upgrade
Miller's performance,'' said Bob Minkoff, a Philip Morris
spokesman. While speculation is rife that Philip Morris intends to
sell Miller eventually, Minkoff said there was no plan to do so.
``If we wanted to sell it, why would we send a good team out
there?'' he said. ``It's a core business, and we believe we can
grow it.''
</P>
<P>
   In his letter to shareholders printed in the company's most
recent annual report, Geoffrey C. Bible, the chief executive of
Philip Morris, indicated his displeasure with Miller, calling its
performance ``disappointing,'' although he added that the company
was ``taking encouraging steps.''
</P>
<P>
   With only 3 percent of its profits coming from Miller, on
revenues of about $500 million, Philip Morris might be better off
without its beer business, several analysts suggested. With a 21
percent market share, Miller is dwarfed by Anheuser, which has
about 45 percent. But to get the best price, certain problems need
to be fixed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key thing they need is a compelling marketing message for
the consumer,'' said David J. Adelman, a beer analyst for Morgan
Stanley. ``There has not been a consistent, attractive message to
the core beer consumer, and that is not something that can change
overnight.'' Although the beer industry has not grown in several
years, Miller still has an opportunity to increase its volume and
market share with the right tactics, Adelman added.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cigarette industry hasn't grown since 1980,'' he said,
``and yet Philip Morris has been able to consistently grow its
share, year in and year out. Just because you have a few large
companies doesn't mean you can't have a dynamic, successful
business.''
</P>
<P>
   The management shake-up at Miller was announced after the stock
market closed. Philip Morris' shares ended trading down $1.1875, to
$33.5625.

<P>
   Proving once again that nothing is sacred, not even vacation
time, companies are zeroing in on those precious moments spent in
sunny, snowy or neon-lit spots to market consumer products.
</P>
<P>
   It is all based on the theory that people on vacation experience
a temporary suspension of certain protective mechanisms and spend
more freely. Maybe the absence of bills piled on the hall table
gives rise to such a condition. At any rate, when they are away
from home, ``Consumers are likely to open up their wallets and
spend a little more rather than living on a budget, where they are
watching their dollars and living within their means,'' said Donald
Stuart, a consultant with Cannondale Associates in Wilton, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is what might be called the Proustian effect, in
which marketers believe that a product sampled on vacation becomes
a metaphor for that short, happy period of time, once vacationers
return to their everyday lives. Thus, even though a person cannot
be on vacation forever, he or she can keep buying that product
forever instead.
</P>
<P>
   Such thinking has amalgamated into a concept known as
``destination marketing,'' in which companies pour promotion
dollars into places they have identified as prime vacation spots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, we decided to fish where the fish are,'' said Bill
Yetman, president and chief executive of Beck's North America, the
U.S. division of the German brewery. Two years ago, the company
hired extra sales representatives in seven places _ Orlando, Fla.;
New Orleans; Phoenix; Las Vegas; San Diego; southeast Florida, and
Hawaii _ and went to work promoting Beck's, one of the
higher-priced beers, in bars and hotels as well as wholesale
outlets. This year, they added the Reno-Lake Tahoe area in Nevada
to the list. San Antonio and southwest Florida are on the drawing
board.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people are going to these destinations for vacations or
conventions,'' Yetman said, ``and the ideal situation would be that
they return from Las Vegas or wherever and go back home to Omaha or
Buffalo, and at the very least associate Beck's with the pleasant
times they had at these destinations. Or become regular consumers
of Beck's.'' The idea occurred to him, he said, while swinging a
golf club in Phoenix. ``I was looking at how beautiful it was, and
thinking: `You know, people come here a lot. I should do something
with that.'''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it is impossible to tell how many people experience a
product on vacation and end up buying it regularly. But in six of
those destination markets, Yetman said, sales of Beck's, at prices
from $2.50 to $8 a bottle, rose 20 percent or more the first year.
The seventh rose as well, though not as much.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies are also in on the act. Automakers have long
placed shiny new cars inside airport arrival terminals. Godiva
chocolates, made by Campbell Soup Co., and Starbucks coffee bars
line many an airport concourse. Hotel minibars are hotly contested
display spaces for products ranging from bottled water to gourmet
potato chips, and luxury-goods makers arrange for giveaways of
their products in certain hotel rooms.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Luxury marketers absolutely recognize the importance of the
travel market,'' said Lisa Henriques Hughes, publisher of Conde
Nast Traveler, where half the ad pages have nothing to do with
airlines or accommodations, but everything to do with expensive
fountain pens, Prada bags, hefty watches and imported cars.
``Travel is such a market screen for affluence.'' It is also a big
attraction for baby boomers, she added. ``Baby boomers are now in
their prime earning years. Intellectually, we want to see the
world, and we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Bacardi-Martini USA has a destination market, the Mandalay Bay
resort in Las Vegas, where its brands like Bacardi 8 rum and B&AMP;B
liqueur will be part of tasting seminars at the hotel. ``We are
reaching the vacationer who has disposable income, who comes away
from the tasting with information and knowledge to use at home and
experiences the product in a unique and upscale environment,'' said
a spokeswoman, Laura Baddish.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the method of steering travel to particular places
in hopes of promoting one product or another. Visa has teamed up
with cities like Baltimore and San Francisco to promote the use of
the card through books of discount coupons that can be used for
hotels and restaurants. ``It's to encourage travelers to use Visa
while they are traveling,'' said Charles Mardiks, a spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Bacardi is trying something similar. In February, the company
held a conference for travel agents and tour-group leaders that
featured B&AMP;B made into a cocktail. At the same time, the room was
decorated with posters of the Palais Benedictine, a former palace
in Normandy that houses the distillery as well as an art gallery.
``When they are planning their clients' itineraries, this is one of
the activities they can go to,'' Ms. Baddish said.
</P>
<P>
   It is interesting to think about other destinations that might
work their way onto the tourist map because of consumer products
that wouldn't mind a sales boost. Could Bloomsburg, Pa., make the
cut, by virtue of the Heinz pet-food factory there? Or how about
Buena Park, Calif., which is home to a Nabisco cookie factory?
Cities could end up competing to be named ``destination markets,''
giving American companies a whole new layer of influence.

USC DECIDES AGAINST POINT GUARD BRUNNER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ No basketball players signed letters-of-intent
with USC on Wednesday, but the Trojans apparently have decided
against one player who wanted to join the team.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Brunner, a point guard from Dominguez High School, will
not be admitted to the school, although he had met with athletic
department officials recently and has worked out with some USC
players.
</P>
<P>
   Brunner played at Georgetown his freshman season and transferred
to Fresno State last year but never played for the Bulldogs.
</P>
<P>
   Late last year, Brunner avoided criminal charges in two separate
cases. In December, a Fresno County judge dismissed four felony
counts of robbery and assault against Brunner. In September, Los
Angeles prosecutors dropped charges of attempted murder and robbery
of a junior college coach.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans have three scholarships available, and are still
interested in several players.
</P>
<P>
   USC is looking at Verbum Dei point guard Marlon Parmer, who is
scheduled to make a campus visit, and Fairfax shooting guard Joe
Shipp, who is also considering California, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Another player drawing interest is Danny Brotherson, a 6-foot-3
shooting guard from Utah Valley State College in Orem, Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, it appears forward Shannon Swillis will remain with
the team. There had been speculation he would transfer, following
the departures last month of guard Quincy Wilder and forward Greg
Lakey.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ It happens all the time in the legal and financial
worlds: Lawyers or stockbrokers jump from one firm to another,
taking their clients _ and the clients' money _ with them.
</P>
<P>
   But what happens if the professional is a doctor?
</P>
<P>
   When Dr. Andrew Wiznia, a highly regarded pediatric AIDS
specialist at Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center, announced in February
that he would move to another Bronx hospital, Jacobi Medical
Center, and that his patients and precious Medicaid and
research-grant money would follow, Bronx-Lebanon wasted no time. It
sued him and two colleagues, not only asking for millions of
dollars in damages but also seeking to bar the doctors from
treating their patients anywhere else for six months.
</P>
<P>
   Although legal maneuvering like that may be common in the
business world, Wiznia warned in court papers that such a
prohibition could have ``potentially life-threatening
consequences'' for the vulnerable patients he sees: about 180
children who are HIV positive, some with AIDS. They are not, he
adds, ``chattel belonging to any institution.''
</P>
<P>
   But the hospital has angrily contended in memos that ``the
patients in the pediatric AIDS center belong to the hospital'' and
has put the AIDS clinic's workers on notice that it is ``incorrect
for the staff giving patients `choices''' about where they can be
treated.
</P>
<P>
   Such high-stakes turf wars, once unheard of, are becoming more
common among hospitals around the country, health care experts say.
As managed care squeezes hospitals' budgets, hospitals are
increasingly trying to woo popular doctors, hoping they will bring
with them a rich pipeline of patients and coveted research grant
money.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the competition was mainly for doctors who treated
privately insured patients, but these days competition is fierce
even for those who care for patients covered by Medicaid, the
government-financed health insurance for the poor. Those patients
were once shunned because reimbursement for their care was so low,
but they are now considered a reasonable source of income.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest battles are over a particularly coveted set of
Medicaid patients whose bills are richly reimbursed.
</P>
<P>
   This set of patients calls for many surgical specialties _
obstetrics and gynecology, neurology and orthopedic surgery. And in
New York, where Medicaid payment rates for HIV and AIDS treatment
are higher than in any other state, it includes patients like the
ones Wiznia and his colleagues have treated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consequence,'' said Mark Barnes, a New York health care
lawyer and former AIDS policy official with the city's Health
Department, ``is that there's acute competition among New York City
hospitals not only for AIDS patients, but for the physicians who
treat them.''
</P>
<P>
   Although jilted hospitals, in general, tend to make some kind of
fuss over departing doctors, often threatening legal action or,
alternately, offering incentives for the doctors to stay, health
care experts said this case was unusual because Bronx-Lebanon had
actually gone to court to block Wiznia's move. Neither Dr. Wiznia
nor his two colleagues had contracts with the hospital. The lawsuit
keeps Wiznia and his two colleagues temporarily in place at
Bronx-Lebanon, after the sides agreed to a three-week ``cooling
off'' period, which ends Friday, when a judge is scheduled to hear
a request from the hospital to keep the doctors in place longer.
</P>
<P>
   The case has also raised complex ethical questions that doctors
and hospitals must now confront at the intersection of medicine and
big business, including questions about the rights of poor,
publicly insured patients vs. wealthier, privately insured ones.
</P>
<P>
   Would anyone, for example, try to prevent private patients from
following a doctor who switched hospitals, or describe them as
belonging to the first hospital?
</P>
<P>
   And is it unfair competition, or misuse of confidential patient
records, if a doctor tells his patients that he is leaving a
hospital and that he hopes they will follow? Or is he simply being
a conscientious doctor?
</P>
<P>
   Almost all of Wiznia's patients have indicated that they want to
follow him and his colleagues to their new home at Jacobi.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of income Bronx-Lebanon would suffer if those patients
left is compounded because Wiznia's move to Jacobi also threatens
to strip the hospital of another huge chunk of money, more than $1
million a year in research grants from the government and from drug
companies for Bronx-Lebanon's pediatric AIDS center, one of the
busiest in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Partly because New York state's overall share of research money
from the prestigious National Institutes of Health _ the largest
contributor to Bronx-Lebanon's pediatric AIDS program _ has
declined over the last decade, such grants are as good as gold to
both private hospitals, like Bronx-Lebanon, and public hospitals,
like Jacobi.
</P>
<P>
   They are particularly important sources of income to the
hospitals in this case, both of which serve a predominantly poor
population, with many uninsured patients and few opportunities for
major philanthropic donations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without any major grant funding, the center will likely lose
patients and staff, thereby placing its immediate future in serious
jeopardy,'' the hospital claimed as part of the suit.
</P>
<P>
   The National Institutes of Health has written to the hospital to
say that when a principal researcher associ- ated with a grant _
such as Wiznia _ switches hospitals, generally ``the grant has
moved with that individual.'' The NIH has also called
Bronx-Lebanon, asking it to release the grant. The hospital has
refused, and it now appears the grant will remain at Bronx-Lebanon
at least while the hospital applies to have it renewed under a new
doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the doctors named in the suit nor officials at
Bronx-Lebanon returned calls seeking comment for this article. But
in court documents, which include almost two months of angry
letters between the hospital and the doctors who left,
Bronx-Lebanon officials accused Wiznia of essentially arranging a
coup to steal patients and most of the AIDS center's staff.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   They say that on Feb. 16, the day he resigned _ citing
longstanding disagreements with the hospital over grant spending
and the hospital's commitment to the AIDS center _ Wiznia also
handed over resignation letters for 19 of the center's 28 staff
members.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital contends that Wiznia essentially misled the other
staff members, and induced them to follow him by telling them that
the AIDS program was to be transferred to a ``windowless basement''
and that he was about to be fired, which the hospital says is
untrue. Wiznia denied that he misled anyone, and accused the
hospital of failing to support the clinic by not hiring necessary
personnel and not paying bills promptly. He said hospital officials
had told him that the clinic would be moved out of its offices near
the Grand Concourse.
</P>
<P>
   He added in court papers that he was not leaving because he
would make more money at Jacobi, which, he pointed out, is part of
the ``financially strapped municipal hospital system.'' The
incentive, he said, was that Jacobi would commit the resources he
felt he needed to run his program.
</P>
<P>
   The same day that Wiznia and two colleagues, Dr. Joanna
Dobroszycki and Dr. Michael Rosenberg, resigned, they mailed
letters to parents of their patients, reminding them that they were
legally entitled to get treatment anywhere they wanted. ``It is our
sincerest hope,'' the letter said, ``that you have been happy with
us as your medical care provider and will choose to remain our
patient.''
</P>
<P>
   Wiznia contends that this was his moral and even legal
responsibility and, indeed, that of any doctor who moves. In his
case, his lawyers say, it was even more important because he has
treated some of the infected children continuously for as long as a
decade, has detailed knowledge of their drug regimens and medical
quirks, and has earned their trust.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can hardly be said that vying to care for sick children
with AIDS is analogous to stealing confidential information from an
insurance company or misappropriating cutting-edge computer
technology,'' wrote Wiznia's lawyers, referring to cases the
hospital's lawyers had cited to condemn the doctors' actions.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Ram Kairam, Bronx-Lebanon's director of pediatrics,
argues that it was exactly the hallowed doctor-patient relationship
that Wiznia and his colleagues abused. ``He confused the sanctity
of the doctor-patient relationship with the business of the
hospital,'' Kairam said. He added: ``What would IBM say if you
stole their clients and took them somewhere else?''
</P>
<P>
   Wiznia referred calls about this article to his lawyer, Richard
Nicholson. Nicholson said Wednesday that Kairam's comments betrayed
the hospital's hard focus on money.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kids to them are poker chips,'' he said. ``The sanctity
of the doctor-patient relationship outweighs the business of the
hospital in every situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Thomas, 55, the grandfather of a 7-year-old HIV-positive
patient, said he would not think twice about sending his grandson
to Jacobi, even though he serves as the chairman of Bronx-Lebanon's
AIDS Community Advisory Board and feels a responsibility to the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in a precarious position here where I'm trying to be
neutral, but I'm going to stay loyal to the people who saved my
grandson's life,'' said Thomas, who, like many of Wiznia's
patients, speaks of him in almost reverent tones. ``Maybe there are
faults on both sides. It's like in a marriage. But you've got to
recognize the work these people have done to save lives.''
</P>
<P>
   An official with one of the foster-care agencies that represents
dozens of the young patients _ about 40 percent of the hospital's
patients are in foster care _ said every foster parent associated
with that agency quickly decided to follow Wiznia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I deal with a lot of immunologists, and he's the best one I
know,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
``We didn't even have to go to the parents. We gave them the
option, but they had already made up their minds.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, most of the parents have already asked that their
children's medical records be transferred to Jacobi.
</P>
<P>
   But Bronx-Lebanon has let the parents know that it would love to
keep their business after Wiznia and his colleagues leave.
</P>
<P>
   The end of a March 8 letter to patients' parents was reminiscent
of an old-fashioned toaster offer from a bank: Kairam announced
that the chief executive of the hospital, Miguel Fuentes, had
authorized free parking and Metropasses for patients and their
parents, and taxis for those bringing in sick children. He promised
that the hospital would improve the elevators at the clinic and
would also start serving free lunches.
</P>
<P>
   As both sides become mired in the case, Wiznia has warned
ominously that the dispute has already begun to affect the
treatment of sick children. The National Institutes of Health has
halted enrollment of new children into their clinical drug trials
at Bronx-Lebanon because of the lawsuit, he said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Wiznia wrote, an 8-month-old baby with AIDS whose
parents consented on March 15 to enroll him in a clinical trial
``is now unable to obtain this essential treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   Kairam said in an interview that Wiznia could easily enroll the
child in a similar drug trial at another hospital, and was simply
using the story of the infant to vilify Bronx Lebanon. He added
that he blamed Wiznia for the enrollment being halted.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole thing could have been done in a peaceable manner,''
he said of Wiznia's plans to move to Jacobi. Parents of the
children who are caught in the middle of the battle say they are
just ready for it to be over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that AIDS is a business,'' said Leonard Rabb, 43, an
HIV-positive man whose 10-year-old son is also infected and has
been treated by Wiznia and his colleagues for four years. ``It's
about dollars and cents. But Andy talks to my son not just as a
doctor _ as a kind of parent. When something isn't going to work,
he's honest about it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This thing,'' he said resolutely, ``needs to get settled.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With a partial trade accord with China nearly in
hand, President Clinton argued Wednesday that America would benefit
by helping guide the world's most-populous nation toward economic
stability.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's speech on relations with China came just hours before
Premier Zhu Rongji arrived here for a three-day visit, which
included an informal private meeting with the president Wednesday
night at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said Clinton planned to announce at a
joint news conference on Thursday that the two countries had
reached agreement on several issues that could help pave the way
for China to join the World Trade Organization later this year.
They said China had made broad concessions in a wide range of areas
critical to American companies, from cellular telephone providers
to insurers seeking to sell policies to 20 percent of the world's
population.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the planned announcement, China's trade minister
and American negotiators were scrambling to narrow differences in
an enormously complex deal that would require China to dismantle
state control of its economy and open state-owned firms to intense
foreign competition. But several issues remained unresolved, among
them how to enforce China's compliance with the trade agreement.
</P>
<P>
   China has sought entry to the World Trade Organization for 13
years for prestige and to guarantee it the economic protections
afforded to most trading nations.
</P>
<P>
   But any deal would require support in Congress, which at this
stage seems tenuous, given concerns over assertions that China
stole nuclear secrets, its questionable campaign contributions to
President Clinton's 1996 re-election campaign and worsening
political repression in China. Wednesday afternoon, as Zhu's
motorcade sped toward Blair House, the Senate majority leader,
Trent Lott, announced he opposed a deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Letting China into the WTO at this time shows how far this
administration is willing to go in an effort to salvage its failed
policy of strategic partnership with China,'' the Mississippi
Republican said in a statement. ``This is the wrong decision at the
wrong time.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Clinton Wednesday tried to create the basis for an
announcement of some kind of agreement, saying in a speech here,
``If China is willing to play by the global rules of trade, it
would be an inexplicable mistake for the United States to say no.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting this done and getting it done right is profoundly in
our national interest,'' Clinton said. ``It is not a favor to
China. It is the best way to level the playing field.''
</P>
<P>
   But a top administration official said that unless Zhu approved
additional concessions, Clinton could not announce a completed deal
that would include unconditional administration support for WTO
membership.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Congress would have to amend a cold war law that
allows it to vote each year on China's trade status, and Lott's
statement suggested that Congressional concerns about other topics,
from human rights to espionage, would stand in the way of any
accord. He said he did not want to let Clinton reward China with
entry into the organization because he was skeptical that even with
a deal, China would end what he said were its ``predatory'' trade
practices. The U.S. trade deficit with China was $57 billion last
year.
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles E. Grassley, R-Iowa, has introduced a bill to give
Congress 60 days to review any deal. But he too said Wednesday that
approval seemed remote. ``Republicans feel, do you want to trust
China and give them a feather in their cap while they're stealing
our military secrets?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress who visited China last week and met with Zhu
gave a preview of the Chinese leader as a tough negotiator. Sen.
Kent Conrad, D-N.D., said the Americans raised all of the sensitive
issues raging in Congress and said that Zhu's response was that
they were trying to politicize an economic issue.
</P>
<P>
   Conrad also said that unless the trade deal clearly gave America
the same access to Chinese markets that China has to American
markets, Congress would not approve it. ``Even if it's perfect, it
will be a tough challenge in this environment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mindful of anti-China sentiment in Congress, Clinton in his
speech Wednesday offered an unusually critical analysis of a
country whose leader is on his doorstep. He criticized China for
political repression, saying ``a tight grip is actually a sign of a
weak hand.'' He said China's backward industries were polluting its
countryside. But he insisted that the United States must use its
influence to coax China toward democracy and economic stability.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we focus on the potential challenge that a strong China
could present to the United States in the future,'' Clinton said,
``let us not forget the risk of a weak China, beset by internal
conflicts, social dislocation and criminal activity, becoming a
vast zone of instability in Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also tried to deflect the condemnation of his engagement
policy by Republican presidential candidates, appealing to them to
avoid ``a campaign-driven cold war'' that would give comfort only
to ``the most rigid, backward-looking elements'' in China.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Clinton has been eyeing the vast markets that
China offers to American business and has become a strong advocate
of engagement with the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
   In negotiations on the trade accord, complete agreement had been
reached by Wednesday night in one of the most contentious areas _
removing Chinese barriers to American agricultural imports,
especially wheat and meat. And there has been all but complete
agreement on other issues of market access, with China agreeing to
phase out many of its trading restrictions and high tariffs in
three to five years. Foreigners will be allowed to invest in
Chinese telecommunications companies _ but not take a controlling
interest in those firms. The weakest part of the accord involves
broader access for American banks and investment brokerages, where
one official said, ``We're going to have a lot of unhappy folks on
Wall Street.''
</P>
<P>
   Other issues still open tonight were import quotas. China has
accused the United States of trying to prolong American import
restrictions on Chinese-made textiles _ quotas that were supposed
to end in five years. The United States, responding to pressure
from Congress, now wants to extend the quota system for 10 more
years.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and China did agree Wednesday on a
civil-aviation accord that will double passenger and cargo flights
between them. Lael Brainard, a White House official who specializes
in international economic issues, said the agreement would allow an
additional U.S. airline, which she did not identify, to enter the
Chinese market and allow more American cities to have direct air
service to China.

   GENEVA, Switzerland _ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on
Wednesday put the United Nations firmly behind punishment for
ethnic purges, declaring that ``impunity is unacceptable'' for such
terrible violations of human rights.
</P>
<P>
   Annan made the statement before the U.N. Human Rights
Commission, a 53-country body that is holding its annual meeting in
Geneva to review rights violations in dozens of countries.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week Annan condemned the mass expulsions from
Kosovo, but on Wednesday he went further, saying it appeared that
some aspects of the ethnic purges in the province border on
genocide.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations has tried not to appear to back any one side
in the conflict over Kosovo, but the refugee tide has made
officials bolder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of all gross violations, genocide knows no parallel in human
history,'' Annan said. Although the United Nations has no monitors
in the province, ``the signs are that it may be happening, once
more, in Kosovo,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vicious and systematic campaign of `ethnic cleansing'
conducted by the Serbian authorities in Kosovo appears to have one
aim: to expel or kill as many ethnic Albanians in Kosovo as
possible, thereby denying a people their most basic rights to life,
liberty and security,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   He warned that violators could not hide behind the principle of
state sovereignty to avoid being held accountable.

WINNER OF MASTERS MUST SHOW TOUGHNESS AND KEEP HIS HEAD

<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ The golf course has changed, but the keys to
victory have remained the same. Whoever wins the Masters, which
begins Thursday at Augusta National Golf Club, will take a familiar
path to victory.
</P>
<P>
   The winner will need a superb week of putting on Augusta's
lightning-fast greens. He will need precise approach shots, to
avoid the sure-fire trouble spots that lead to bogeys,
double-bogeys, or worse.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps most important, the winner will need nerves of steel
on the weekend, the unshakable belief that he is tough enough, good
enough and composed enough to finish the job.
</P>
<P>
   Many hearts have been broken on Augusta's final nine holes. So
while 96 players will tee off, far fewer have a realistic chance to
win.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many have a chance of winning?'' said Fred Couples, who
won the Masters in 1992, and who tied for second last year.
``Fifty. But realistically, I'd say 10 or 12 guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Couples is on the short list of favorites, along with other
obvious choices like David Duval, Tiger Woods, Davis Love 3rd, and
last year's champion, Mark O'Meara.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike last year, when players were greeted Thursday with
winds of 30 to 35 miles an hour, the weather is not expected to be
much of a factor. Afternoon temperatures during the tournament are
expected to reach 80 degrees with little wind, and there is only a
slight chance of rain in the extended forecast. The ideal
conditions should allow more players to shoot low, which could draw
more players into contention.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, no matter what happens, don't jump to conclusions on
Thursday. The first-round leader hasn't won the Masters since 1984,
when Ben Crenshaw opened with a 67.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, the winner has to overcome at least one poor spell and
it usually happens early in the tournament. Even Tiger Woods
started with a 40 on the front nine in 1997, when he set the
tournament record (270) and won by a record-setting 12 strokes.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, O'Meara opened with a two-over-par 74 and he left the
18th green talking to himself before an emergency putting session
with his coach, Hank Haney, helped turn O'Meara around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel comfortable with my putter and I was putting
poorly,'' O'Meara said. ``On No. 10, I had an eight-footer for par,
and I didn't know whether I was going to pull it, push it or hit it
long. Basically, my confidence was very, very low. At that point,
I'm thinking to myself, `You can't be thinking this way if you want
to win a major championship, let alone at Augusta National.'''
</P>
<P>
   It speaks volumes about O'Meara's fortitude that he was able to
regroup and to win, never leading until the final hole, where he
sank the now famous 20-foot putt for birdie. Playing in his 15th
Masters last year, O'Meara drew on the knowledge he had acquired
over the years, while a younger player may have panicked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Experience is a big factor here,'' O'Meara said. ``On Sunday
last year, I just tried to play smart. It's not hard to be overly
aggressive here. You've got to wait and put your ball into certain
positions. You see the pin and you say, `I'm going to shoot at it.'
But if you miss, you pay a severe penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   The average age for Masters winners is 32.7, not good news for
Duval, who is 27, Ernie Els who is 29, or Lee Westwood, who is 25.
Of course, Woods was 21 in 1997.

   Fuzzy Zoeller was the last player to win the Masters in his
first attempt, in 1979. But what do Love, O'Meara, Nick Price,
Justin Leonard, Bernhard Langer, Jack Nicklaus, Jose Maria
Olazabal, Bob Tway, Craig Stadler and Ian Woosnam have in common?
All of them missed the cut in their first Masters. Westwood, ranked
No. 7 in the world, will be trying to win the Masters in his third
attempt, something that Woods did in 1997. But Westwood admitted
Augusta nerves have hampered him in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've watched it so many years on TV, that when I got here, I
was overwrought with the whole thing,'' Westwood said. ``A couple
of years ago, I had played nearly 72 holes by now in practice. I
wore myself out.''
</P>
<P>
   Length remains an advantage at Augusta, but average length
drivers like Nick Faldo, Olazabal and O'Meara have won this decade.
O'Meara believes what he does with the putter will be more
important than what he does with his driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who has won here didn't have a mediocre putting
week,'' O'Meara said. ``Faldo, when he won, didn't have
three-putts. Tiger, when he won, putted extremely well. Putting is
as important as anything else, in my opinion.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ This city has served itself a little slice of
architecture: the new Second Stage Theater on Eighth Avenue and
43rd Street. Designed by Rem Koolhaas, the awesomely talented Dutch
architect, in association with Richard Gluckman of New York, the
296-seat playhouse is an architectural hors d'oeuvre, really just a
piece or two of sushi on a plate.
</P>
<P>
   But it's fresh and tangy, a morsel of the sophisticated design
many New Yorkers have been craving. To paraphrase Oscar Wilde, this
latest addition to the Theater District is exquisite and leaves one
unsatisfied.
</P>
<P>
   Founded 20 years ago by Robyn Goodman and by Carole Rothman, who
remains the group's artistic director, the Second Stage, previously
on the Upper West Side, specializes in American plays. Its new
season officially opens next week with performances of ``That
Championship Season'' by Jason Miller.
</P>
<P>
   The group's new home is an oasis in our newly upgraded Times
Square neighborhood. There is no theming, no nostalgia, plaster
nymphs or gilt rosettes. It's a light, modest arena for smart,
modern playgoers.
</P>
<P>
   This is Koolhaas' second project for New York; his design for
the Lehmann Maupin Gallery in Soho was completed in 1996. The
theater, at 307 W. 43rd St., in Clinton, occupies a four-story
former bank building that had stood empty for eight years. Built in
1927, the building has trim Art Deco lines, ornamented with
stylized polychrome foliage. The Koolhaas-Gluckman design leaves
the exterior nearly intact. It incorporates many features of the
original building, a necessity dictated by the restricted budget
and one that contributes to its esthetic effect.
</P>
<P>
   The entrance is through a plain glass door on 43rd Street. An
outer lobby, painted light gray, leads to a box office within the
bank's safe, its thick steel door plainly visible.
</P>
<P>
   The theater proper is on the second floor, a tall space, once
the main banking hall. In the upstairs lobby, walls and floor are
painted screeching orange, a vibrant color at once tropical citrus
grove and toxic defoliant. We are not in Mickey Mouseland anymore.
</P>
<P>
   There is no fixed division between the upstairs lobby and the
auditorium. Rather, a large, bleacherlike wedge of seats in the
middle of the second floor defines it into different areas in one
continuous flow: lobby, stage, backstage, seating and aisles.
</P>
<P>
   The wedge, about 12 feet tall at the rear, is asymmetrically
placed and finished with epoxy resin in a deep shade of green-gray.
An aisle leads along one side of the wedge to the front of the
house. Twelve-foot-tall windows, fitted with acoustical glass,
punctuate the wall across the aisle, framing views of 43rd Street.
The wall is draped with gold velour curtains, studded with steel
grommets. At performance time, the curtains can be drawn. When left
open, the city itself is onstage here.
</P>
<P>
   So is backstage, in part. Performers reach the stage via a
second aisle, enclosed behind a side wall of translucent corrugated
plastic on the far side of the wedge. With the house lights on
behind it, this wall glows with a cheap, industrial glamour. When
the lights are off, the plastic panels take on the glint of
satin-finish steel.
</P>
<P>
   The seats are of black wood, fitted with resilient pads made
from a gel originally developed for bicycle seats. The pads are the
color of parchment, and partly translucent; the shade darkens at
the edges, like gold velvet, an effect that echoes the plush of the
curtains. A rectangular cut in the plastic wall reveals a shallow
mezzanine furnished with a dozen or so moveable chairs.
</P>
<P>
   There is no permanent stage or proscenium. Right now the theater
has both; these are part of the set. Directors and designers are
free to construct a different staging and scenic arrangement for
each production. There is generous space from which to suspend
lights, backdrops and other items from above the stage. Tracks for
theatrical lighting extend the full length and width of the
auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   The Koolhaas flair for naughtiness is restricted to two
bathrooms, set into the rear of the seating wedge and entered
through the lobby. These, too, are painted orange, with naked
fluorescent tubes glaring out from above the mirrors at eye level.
The reflection is perversely consoling: this is the worst you are
going to look all day.
</P>
<P>
   Straightforwardness filtered through a wayward imagination: this
is a Koolhaas design, all right. A theater with windows? No wall
between lobby and auditorium? These ideas may be odd to
contemplate, but they fit. They animate the intersection between
those two Vitruvian virtues, commodity and delight. So do simple
features like the gel seat pads, the strip of galvanized steel
grating used as a guardrail on one side of the wedge, the
off-center placement of a center aisle between the seats and a
quirky curve at the top of the aisle.
</P>
<P>
   As readers of Koolhaas' book ``S, M, L, XL'' may recall, the
architect has periodically flirted with the idea of writing
screenplays. But he has largely sublimated this ambition into
design. City views, saturated color, translucent surfaces, the
sculptural treatment of function and the mix of cheap, costly,
space-age and traditional materials, custom-made and off-the-peg
hardware: these disparate elements are harmoniously composed in a
serpentine flow of space, as a cinematic montage is organized in
time.
</P>
<P>
   It is a performance space for spectators as well as actors, in
the sense that clothes by Prada and Jil Sander are costumes for the
urban stage. These designers dress people for a mythology of the
present. Koolhaas and Gluckman extend that mythical element into
the architectural dimension. You can show up in Gap clothes and
absorb the full effect.
</P>
<P>
   New York is poor in such spaces. Philippe Starck's interiors for
the Royalton and Paramount Hotels are holding up well for a couple
of Zeitgeist zones. John Pawson's Madison Avenue shop for Calvin
Klein and Adam Tihany's design for Jean Georges, a restaurant on
Columbus Circle, are potential classics. The new Comme des Garcons
shop in Chelsea tries too hard, but who can blame the store's
designers for overcompensation? Perhaps they're just trying to make
up for the dullness of most retail interiors.
</P>
<P>
   Among cultural institutions, we've got the galleries Gluckman
designed last year for the Whitney Museum of American Art,
Frederick Fisher's renovations at the PS 1 Contemporary Art Center,
and that's about it. There's been no esthetically alert theatrical
space since Raimund Abraham's design for the Anthology Film
Archives in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The Second Stage is a work in progress, its completion
contingent on additional fund-raising. A small marquee has been
designed for the entrance, and there are plans to uncover and
soundproof five more of those grand windows in the auditorium,
including three behind the stage. This would make it possible to
turn the theater into a floating urban platform, hovering above the
street at dream's-eye level.
</P>
<P>
   A pity that the company's productions are limited to American
plays. Don't you want to see Beckett, Orton, Pinter, Genet and
Shakespeare staged in a house with orange bathrooms? Sure you do.
And what a gem of a showcase this theater would be for art films.
If design were a draw, the new Second Stage would become the most
sought-after screening room in town.

BOOK TALK: WHEN DEAD MEN TELL THEIR TALES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MARTIN ARNOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is often challenging and ghostly work, evaluating the wishes
of a writer who is dead, deciding whether a hidden manuscript is
worthy of display and therefore should be published.
</P>
<P>
   For authors who are important or popular, or both, there is
pressure to keep the property alive, their bodies of work available
and visible, to generate not only art but cash. To do so, there has
to be something new. Enter the literary executor, and lo and
behold, bingo, what was in the vaults is now on the bookshelves.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe even if that's not what the author wanted.
</P>
<P>
   The excerpt of Ralph Ellison's second novel this week in The New
Yorker reminds us that this summer there will be two major
posthumous literary events, the novel that Ellison had worked on
for 40 years and the publication of a new Ernest Hemingway novel 38
years after his death.
</P>
<P>
   Neither would have occurred without a truly resolute literary
executor, a role that is usually almost underground in its
covertness but has popped to the foreground because of the attack
on the publication of the Hemingway book by Joan Didion.
</P>
<P>
   Like only dictators or co-op boards, literary (or artistic)
executors have the absolute power to render, without restraint, the
property they superintend. They usually control only the writer's
or painter's or composer's creative work, not the remainder of the
estate as well. Thus they have the power to sift the work, edit it,
hide it away or hang it, sell it, open it only to scholars, donate
it to university libraries, have it published or performed. Or for
that matter to put a match to it.
</P>
<P>
   This spectral wedding between the executor and the dead writer
often raises the question, if an author didn't finish the novel, is
the novel publishable as the author's work? Is a de Kooning with
half the canvas left unpainted a de Kooning? Or supposing the
writer had every opportunity to finish and publish the work before
his or her death, and didn't, then can't _ shouldn't _ we assume
that the writer didn't want that work published, and aren't we then
required to honor that? Who owns the work? The artist or the
public?
</P>
<P>
   In Ms. Didion's recent essay in The New Yorker, she eloquently
argued that the novel to be published by Scribner in July under
Hemingway's name, titled ``True at First Light,'' was not true
Hemingway; rather, it was cobbled out of a mountain of words he had
written but clearly had not wanted published, or he would have had
it published.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a man to whom words mattered,'' Ms. Didion wrote.
``He worked at them, he understood them, he got inside them. . . .
His wish to be survived by only the words he determined fit for
publication would have seemed clear enough.'' She described this
constructing of a Hemingway novel by the author's son Patrick, a
literary executor, with the help of Scribner as ``the systematic
creation of a marketable product, a discrete body of work different
in kind from, and in fact tending to obscure, the body of work
published by Hemingway in his lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, that's certainly an absolutist viewpoint. To which Patrick
Hemingway replied: ``I think it's a very valid argument. The only
trouble is he did leave the material; he didn't destroy it. Perhaps
he didn't intend to have it published, but when people are dead
it's hard to know what they want. Somebody, some day, was going to
publish these words, and I had particular insights about this
particular work.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Scribner, an editor whose great-great-grandfather
founded the publishing house, said that he had ``no doubt that
Hemingway intended the unfinished work to be published
posthumously.'' He continued: ``He knew an intelligent public would
understand the difference between books he lived to see in print
and those he didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Hemingway did leave instructions not to publish his
correspondence (though they were ignored); he left instructions not
to publish the stories he wrote before he became what he considered
a good writer (though that directive was ignored, too). It would
seem he knew what he wanted published and what he didn't, which
adds muscle to Ms. Didion's essay. (The New Yorker also plans to
excerpt the Hemingway novel.)
</P>
<P>
   Ellison's second novel could also be debated. Ms. Didion said of
it, ``It's not written until it's written.'' But at least in
Elliosn's case there is evidence to believe that he would have
wanted it published. His ``Invisible Man'' (Random House) almost
immediately became acknowledged as a classic of American and even
world literature when it burst upon us in 1952. His second novel,
``Juneteenth,'' which was left unfinished when he died in 1994 and
was excerpted this week, will be published by Random House in June.
It was edited by his literary executor, John Callahan, professor of
humanities at Lewis and Clark College in Portland, Ore., who said,
``I was confronted with a real stack of manuscripts amounting to a
huge unfinished saga in which there were a number of potential
novels, one of which was `Juneteenth.'''
</P>
<P>
   Callahan contends that every word in ``Juneteenth'' was written
by Ellison and that all he did was use Ellison's notes to put the
novel's parts in the sequence that the writer wanted. ``If Ellison
had left instructions that he didn't want this unfinished work to
ever be published. I wouldn't have done it, but he didn't, and he
talked about the work, and Mrs. Ellison said she thought from their
talks that he wanted it published.''
</P>
<P>
   The history of publishing is full of what-ifs. Eugene O'Neill
asked his publisher, Random House, not to publish ``Long Day's
Journey Into Night'' for 25 years after his death, so his wife,
Carlotta O'Neill, who made being his widow a vocation, gave it to
Yale University Press, which published it within three years,
resurrecting the playwright's reputation and value.
</P>
<P>
   ``She probably did it for money, but if she didn't, he might not
have been resurrected,'' said Barbara Gelb, an O'Neill biographer.
</P>
<P>
   Money certainly lurks behind the shoulder of every executor.
Sessalee Hensley, fiction buyer for Barnes &AMP; Noble, said the
Ellison book would be ``a big event both in literature in general
and African-American literature, and will be one of the two big
books of June, a good healthy best seller,'' along with Thomas
Harris' sequel to ``Silence of the Lambs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The baby boomers are coming into economic power; they read
Ellison and Hemingway in their formative years, so both really
appeal to this generation,'' she said, adding: ``Every store will
have a big stack of each. They'll be floor displays in all the
stores.''
</P>
<P>
   So, yes, we'd hardly know Kafka without his literary executor,
and there is this literature thing with Hemingway and Ellison. But
these new novels are also about those floor displays. The question
of whether a dead artist owns his or her work becomes a detail.

FOR BOATS, IT'S HAUL FOR THE BEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(EDS, changes ``break'' to ``brake'' in 6th graf) 
By JEREMY BAGOTT  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The boat trailer leads a hard life.
</P>
<P>
   In proportion to the strength of its frame, it has to bear a
greater load than the vehicle towing it. And it's immersed in
saltwater or freshwater each time the boat is launched and
recovered.
</P>
<P>
   As the April 24 Eastern Sierra trout opener nears, boaters
should ask some hard questions of themselves, say the experts:
</P>
<P>
   _Were concrete blocks placed under the trailer's frame to take
the load off the tires and axle during storage?
</P>
<P>
   _Have all rust spots been sanded, primed and painted?
</P>
<P>
   _When were the wheel bearings last repacked and the brake
linings checked?
</P>
<P>
   Whatever you have or haven't done, you'll need to thoroughly
inspect the trailer before hitching it up.
</P>
<P>
   Every good inspection starts with the shake, rattle and roll
test, which has absolutely no link to the Big Joe Turner song. It's
simply grabbing the frame and shaking the boat and trailer
strenuously a number of times, then checking all rattles for loose
hardware and breakage. The trailer should be off its blocks when
you do this.
</P>
<P>
   Follow the shake test with a careful visual examination. It is
now a good time to make sure the weight of the boat is dispersed
evenly over all rollers. If one roller isn't making contact with
the hull, loosen its bolt, push it up against the boat, then
retighten it.
</P>
<P>
   Next, check the hitch cup and ball contact. The hitch cup and
ball are at the heart of the towing operation and deserve a good
once-over. If all looks right, stick a sliver of soap between the
hitch cup and ball before hooking up the trailer; this acts as a
lubricant.
</P>
<P>
   Next, test the trailer lights and turn signals, then check the
tires for dry rot, bald spots and flat spots. Inflate the tires to
the recommended tire pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Apply waterproof grease to the winch bearings, gears and lock,
the keel roller assembly, the bracket pivots and any other moving
parts you can find.
</P>
<P>
   Repack the wheel bearings, or have them repacked professionally,
and retorque the wheel lug nuts.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, check the safety chain; replace it if it has been
dragging anywhere along its length.
</P>
<P>
   Remember to follow manufacturers' guidelines on all of the
above, first and foremost.
</P>
<P>
   Good fishing at the opener, and don't forget to remove the
cement blocks before pulling out of the driveway.

NEWS ANALYSIS: KEY TO MUSIC DEAL IS E-PROMOTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (kd) 
 By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   At first glance, the new joint Internet venture between
Universal Music and BMG seems to be an effort to squeeze out the
booming online music stores, like CDNow and Amazon.com. Indeed, the
two big record companies Wednesday introduced a site, Getmusic.Com,
that does compete with these sites by selling compact disks.
</P>
<P>
   But in many ways, the middlemen that the record companies are
trying to cut out are the traditional media that promote music,
like Rolling Stone magazine, local radio stations and most
importantly MTV.
</P>
<P>
   The essence of what the companies are trying to do is to use the
interactive nature of the Internet to gather the names and e-mail
addresses of their customers so they can sell more music to them by
artists they already like and to introduce them to new ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``The promotional opportunity of the Internet, as opposed to the
commerce opportunity, is very powerful,'' said Edgar Bronfman Jr.,
chief executive of Seagram Co., which owns Universal Music.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there is no better sign of the venture's lack of
enthusiasm for online retailing than that prices on Getmusic.com
are often 20 percent higher than on CDNow and Amazon.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, Bronfman and BMG executives said that the most important
part of their venture is not Getmusic.com, the music store, but a
series of sites devoted to various music genres. These will start
with five sites developed by BMG, including Peeps.com, for hip-hop,
and Twangthis.Com, a country site.
</P>
<P>
   Peeps, in particular, has been effective in promoting new
artists. For example, the site started publicizing Britney Spears,
offering song samples that users could download, eight months
before her first album was released. It eventually collected the
names of 100,000 people who said they were interested in her music.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than 80 percent of them bought the album,'' said Kevin
Conroy, a BMG senior vice president.
</P>
<P>
   It is this capability to gain direct access to customers that
brought Universal into the venture, said Lawrence Kenswil,
president for electronic commerce at Universal Music. ``People
aren't our customers directly,'' he said. ``They are radio station
listeners, record store customers or MTV viewers. At the end of the
day, we need information about that that is not filtered by third
parties.''
</P>
<P>
   The companies hope to lure people to the genre sites with inside
information and music samples that other sites do not have. Of
course, such content is the stuff of other media outlets, notably
MTV.
</P>
<P>
   And Viacom Inc., MTV's parent, is readying a big new music site.
Fred Sieber, president of MTV Networks Online, said that it would
not be cut out of the information flow because of its longstanding
reputation with both musicians and viewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Artists will talk to us, like they have for 20 years,'' he
said. ``Nobody doesn't want their music exposed.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In addition to its promotional goals, the BMG-Universal venture
is meant to position the record companies for the day when their
customers will be able to download digital versions of records
directly to their computers or to small portable devices, though
Getmusic does not offer such downloads today.
</P>
<P>
   Illegal copies of music, using the MP3 format, are the staple of
many college dorm rooms already. But the record companies want to
impose a system that keeps the royalties flowing their way.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to control the gatekeeper,'' said Thomas Middelhoff,
chairman of Bertelsmann A.G., which owns BMG. ``In the music
business of the future, it is crucial to have direct control over
the customer downloads,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bronfman, by contrast, offers an expanded vision of how music
will be sold on line.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will buy digital music across retail channels,'' he
said. They will use kiosks in stores, push a `buy now' button on
their Internet radio stations, and they will buy using new
devices'' like portable digital players that let people listen to
downloaded music.
</P>
<P>
   It is hardly clear whether the record companies, in fact, have
the upper hand in the game going forward. Many music industry
executives envision the day when popular musicians themselves will
sell songs directly to their fans from their Web sites. Record
retailers, by contrast, argue that since they have the
relationships with customers, they are in the best position to be
the center of music buying.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the retailers who are imperiled, it's the labels,''
said Russell I. Pillar, chief executive of the Virgin Entertainment
Group, the Virgin Group unit that owns a chain of record stores and
will soon open an online music store. ``People buy artists, they
don't buy labels. So you will buy your Cher disk from
Virginmega.com or from Cher.com. You won't buy it from the label
because you don't know who the label is.''

   LOS ANGELES _ Meet Bob Brown, who has owned The Anchor, a marine
hardware and small-boat retailer in Reseda, since 1956. The man
knows outboard motors. His employees are convinced his heart beats
in two-stroke cycles and that a carbureted mixture of fuel and oil
flows through his veins.

   While he knows outboards, he also knows that maintenance of the
family motor ranks right up there with worming Fido, flushing the
hot-water heater and flossing: It's mostly put off until signs of
trouble arise.
</P>
<P>
   And as the days, hours and seconds tick down to Crowley Lake's 5
a.m. flare that kicks off the Eastern Sierra trout opener April 24,
Brown implores anglers to be good to that motor. Because for some
boaters who back their trailers down the ramps at roadside venues
like Crowley, Convict and June lakes, the day will be more bane
than blessing.
</P>
<P>
   The good news? There's more than two weeks left to inspect your
boat and trailer, lay in the right supplies and get the outboard
back in commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Californians don't decommission their boats at the end of the
season. That's more a `back East' thing,'' said Brown. ``It's
because there's no real offseason here.''
</P>
<P>
   But storing an engine properly over periods of inactivity, he
assures, is !ital!not!off! the exclusive domain of Upstate New
Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   Had you done things right, you might have carefully drained the
fuel from your older outboard's tank. And mounted the engine in a
trash can filled with water, then let it run in neutral until it
died of fuel starvation and the float bowl emptied.
</P>
<P>
   You took an aerosol can of fogging oil _ available at any marine
store _ and sprayed the carburetor throat and pulled the starter
cord a few times. And you removed the plugs and sent a spritz of
oil into each cylinder and pulled the starter cord a few more times
to distribute it.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, you drained and refilled the lower-unit gear lubricant.
</P>
<P>
   You !ital!did!off! do all of that, right?
</P>
<P>
   If the answer is no, and your older two-stroke has been sitting
for three months or your four-popper for more than eight months,
there could be trouble afoot.
</P>
<P>
   More on that later, but listen to those who have made boating on
the first day of trout season a tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Fishing buddies Ron Herschberger of Mar Vista and Mas Nobunaga
of West Los Angeles have done the opener for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Nobunaga, who takes his 21-foot Boston Whaler up Highway 395
every year, is big on safety, while Herschberger, whose most recent
boat was a wood-and-glass outboard with a Johnson 35, is the
Johnny-on-the-spot parts guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``My advice,'' said Herschberger, ``is to take extra shear pins
for the prop (shear pins hold the propeller in place and are
designed to shear off in the event it hits an obstruction) and
extra spark plugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Half the people up there have fouled plugs because their
carburetors aren't adjusted for high altitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobunaga focuses on issues of caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``June Lake can be dangerous if it's windy,'' he said. ``It can
be just as bad as the ocean. Stay close to shore in boats with
smaller motors. Also have life jackets, a fire extinguisher and at
least one oar, preferably two,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Now back to the specifics on what happens if you didn't properly
prep your engine for storage, and how to rectify problems that may
have developed.
</P>
<P>
   The fuel in your carburetor float bowl may have gone bad and the
carb jets could be gunked up. If you suspect this has happened,
it's best to have it checked out, said Brown, who also recommends
spending the money to replace the in-line fuel filter and
water-fuel separator.
</P>
<P>
   Here is Brown's short lecture on plugs if they haven't been
replaced in a year: Get new ones.
</P>
<P>
   If the old plugs come out oil-fouled, pitted, carbon-fouled or
otherwise look like a caddis fly hatch occurred on the electrodes,
consult a professional.
</P>
<P>
   Brown recommends attending to the grease fittings and
aggressively cleaning the motor.
</P>
<P>
   Refer to the owner's manual for the lube points and how often
they should be tended to, as well as for recommendations on
changing the lower-unit oil.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these engines are 20 and 30 years old, and the
lower-unit oil is critical,'' Brown said. ``Make sure the lubricant
is clean when you take it out. If it's not, you have to find out if
water is getting in and where it's coming from.''
</P>
<P>
   On the outboard's water pump, Brown is a stickler: ``Replace it
every year for saltwater use, every two years for freshwater.''
Most engine manufacturers agree.
</P>
<P>
   After the engine has been checked and you've pulled your boat to
the Eastern Sierra, keep in mind that some of the lakes have speed
limits. All the lakes along the June Lake Loop have a 10-mph speed
limit, except Grant Lake. Upper Twin Lake out of Bridgeport has no
speed limit, while at neighboring Lower Twin it's 5 mph. Check with
the marina at the lake in question. Most have ramp fees. As far as
boat-size restrictions, ``If you can get it into the lake,'' said
Ken Blaisdell of June Lake's Big Rock Landing, ``you can run it.''

 &HT;    Schuerholz holds course on bullpen
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Despite Mark Wohlers' first-outing shakiness and Mike
Remlinger's pulled back muscle, which has him on the 15-day
disabled list, Braves general manager John Schuerholz hasn't pushed
any panic buttons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're OK,'' Schuerholz said when asked if he was
looking around for any bullpen help. ``If Remlinger had a serious
injury, then I would give you another answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Remlinger is expected to heal relatively quickly from a pulled
back muscle. As for Wohlers, Schuerholz wasn't ready to close the
book on him after watching his four walks and two runs allowed in
the ninth inning of the Braves' opening day loss to the Phillies.
</P>
<P>
   ``His first outing at Turner Field had to take place sooner or
later I'm sure he was a little anxious and uptight,'' Schuerholz
said. ``It's out of the way now. Let's see how he does the next
times out. I think he'll be fine. He threw the ball hard. He threw
the ball with some quality, he just didn't have his command. I'm of
the opinion that he can get it back.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of Schuerholz's optimism otherwise comes from the way John
Rocker and Kevin McGlinchy are going about their business. They
both recorded outs against the single hitters they faced in
Monday's loss to the Phillies.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker pitched the entire spring without giving up a run. The
only number that could have caused concern was his 10 walks in 12
innings pitched, but Rocker thinks he's found the root of that
problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to do too much too soon,'' Rocker said. ``I was
really wanting my velocity to be there and I was overthrowing at
times. I was trying to do in my fourth inning what I throw after
five months, trying to spot a 95 mile-an-hour fastball. But the
last three outings I've felt real strong, real comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Springer throws
</P>
<P>
   Reliever Russ Springer threw off the bullpen mound for 15
minutes Wednesday and all went well, he said afterward. It was 12
weeks to the day since he had had surgery for a herniated disc in
his back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was as close to 100 percent as I can remember,'' Springer
said. ``Felt good. . . . I didn't hold anything back.''
</P>
<P>
   Springer plans to throw again on Friday and Sunday and, if all
goes well, leave for a rehabilitation assignment as the Braves
leave for their first road trip. The Braves should finalize those
plans in the next day or so
</P>
<P>
   Boone's luck
</P>
<P>
   It took a head-first slide into first base for an infield hit to
end Bret Boone's 0-for-7 start as a Brave. He grounded out three
times and either lined or flied out the other four. Otherwise, he
was drawing walks _ he took three of them on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it happens,'' Boone said with a shrug Wednesday
afternoon. ``I feel good though. Best I've felt to open a season,
maybe ever, as far as seeing the ball. I feel good. No hits. It's
weird.''
</P>
<P>
   Simon's start
</P>
<P>
   In his first pinch hit appearance of the season, rookie Randall
Simon came through with a base hit on Tuesday night on a line drive
to left field. It got lost in the hit barrage of the Braves' 11-3
win but it was significant for Simon, who made this team for his
left-handed bat off the bench. Also of note was that it came on an
3-1 pitch for the young hitter not known for having much patience
at the plate.
</P>

   ``In the spring I've been doing a lot of coming off the bench,''
Simon said. ``I feel like I'm getting used to it. . . . I just go
to the plate and don't try to change anything, keep swinging like
always.

 &HT;    Smoltz in command as Phillies are shut down
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After getting blasted for 17 hits by the Braves on
Tuesday night, the Phillies came back to Turner Field on Wednesday
for a pounding of a different sort. This from the right arm of John
Smoltz.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves' No. 3 starter extended the Phillies' misery for
another day by surrendering four singles in the first three innings
and nothing for the next four, commanding Atlanta to a 4-0 win.
Lucky for Philadelphia, Smoltz had to take a seat after the seventh
because of early-season pitch-count restriction.
</P>
<P>
   After dropping the season opener on Monday, the Braves have won
two in a row and 20 of the last 27 games against the Phillies.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-6 Phillies right-hander Carlton Loewer foiled the
Braves for much of the game, but he was no match for Smoltz.
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz teased the Phillies early on, giving up only a pair of
infield hits, a flare to right and one hard-hit liner up the middle
by Desi Relaford in the first three innings. But after Scott
Rolen's soft single to right in the third inning, Smoltz recorded
13 consecutive outs. He struck out eight in his seven innings of
work, throwing 63 of his 93 pitches for strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz also managed to give Greg Maddux a little run for his
money, trying to follow up Maddux's Tuesday night home run with one
of his own. Smoltz gave a ball a nice ride off his bat in the fifth
inning, but to the deepest part of the ballpark for an out in
center field.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves, who hit Loewer hard both times they saw him last
year, combining for 12 earned runs in 6 2/3 innings pitched, got
only two runs off him in the first six innings on Wednesday night
before adding a pair in the seventh. And with Smoltz pitching as
effectively as he did this spring (2.63 ERA), not to mention last
season (17-3, 2.90 ERA), that was more than enough.
</P>
<P>
   Bret Boone started the rally with his first hits of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Overcoming the frustration of an 0-for-7 start, Boone came
through with a pair of hits in his first two at-bats on an infield
hit in the first inning and a solid liner to left in the fourth
inning. He was rewarded for the second one with a gift from Marlon
Anderson. The Phillies second baseman let a Chipper Jones grounder
roll right under his glove, so Boone, who had stolen second, scored
instead of stopping at third for a 1-0 Braves lead in the fourth
inning.
</P>
<P>
   A batter later, Jordan reached on a fielder's choice. He scored
from first on a Javy Lopez double to left field, blowing right past
and Ned Yost stop sign and safely into home for a 2-0 Braves lead.

 &HT;    Aaron's return to glory
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Everyone knew Ben Selig's Ford dealership in Milwaukee
in the mid-1950s, and no one knew the place better than the Braves.
Many of them drove Selig loaner cars that were proudly provided for
the mighty heroes in a baseball-mad town.
</P>
<P>
   That provided Allan Selig, Ben's son, his first entree into the
Braves' clubhouse and, more specifically, began his relationship
with Hank Aaron. In 1954, two months after his 20th birthday, Aaron
earned the left fielder's job after starter Bobby Thomson broke a
leg. Selig, called Bud by everyone and just three months away from
his 20th birthday, spent plenty of time around that team
trouble-shooting car matters for his father.
</P>
<P>
   Selig was in the stands for Aaron's debut that Opening Day, and
Aaron quickly befriended him, beginning a close relationship that
exists to this day. Neither could have expected that both would
become giants of the game. Or that both could be so stigmatized by
their ascents to power.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Bud sympathized with me and knew what I had gone
through,'' Aaron said. ``I have to give credit to him. He helped
tone me down.''
</P>
<P>
   Tonight at Turner Field, Selig, now commissioner of baseball,
will unveil the Hank Aaron Award, which will honor the best hitter
in each league each year. The goals are varied: Selig, striving to
revitalize fan interest in a game still marked by the players
strike of 1994-95, hopes the award stimulates new public awareness;
it also salutes Aaron for breaking Babe Ruth's career home run
record 25 years ago tonight.
</P>
<P>
   But down deep, it is the commissioner's extended hand to Aaron,
an attempt to welcome the home run king back to the game he became
estranged from during the intervening decades. The Aaron Award is,
at its root, about a relationship between a poor Alabama black kid
and a Jewish Wisconsin car dealer and about a friendship nearly a
half-century old.
</P>
<P>
   ``I anguished about Hank and worried about him,'' Selig said.
``I do think Hank was greatly unappreciated.''
</P>
<P>
   It took the country's infatuation with the Mark McGwire-Sammy
Sosa home run chase last summer to contrast what Aaron went through
in 1974. The racial hate mail was ugly enough. But breaking a
record held by Ruth, a god even 26 years after his death, depressed
a large segment of baseball's following. Aaron suggests that Mickey
Mantle would have been the people's choice to hit No. 715.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the only real disappointment,'' Aaron said. ``I just
wish I could have enjoyed it as much as Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa
enjoyed the home run race last season. ... I can enjoy it now.
Twenty-five years ago, I was a bitter person.''
</P>
<P>
   That bitterness was readily apparent to fans. After his
retirement, Aaron rarely appeared at the ballpark. Although he
spent 13 seasons as the Braves vice president for player
development, after stepping down in 1989, he all but vanished from
the baseball landscape. Aaron's admission that he occasionally
re-read some of the hate letters he kept in a box in his attic was,
for many people, a sad, troubling image.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron long maintained that baseball never truly recognized his
achievement, and to watch how Major League Baseball promoted the
McGwire-Sosa saga, his point is well taken. As he took on political
causes, Aaron became more insistent that baseball improve its poor
record of minority hiring. The more outspoken he became, the more
he distanced himself from the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``As he wrote and spoke and campaigned to meet this
responsibility, a curious thing happened,'' Lonnie Wheeler, author
of ``I Had A Hammer,'' wrote in Aaron's new release, ``Home Run.''
``Critics began complaining that Henry Aaron _ the man who had
nothing to say _ had more to say than they wanted to hear.''
</P>
<P>
   Several developments have influenced Aaron's life since then.
For one, baseball's minority-hiring practices have improved, for
which he can take some credit. The passing of time might have
softened some of his edges, too. But the Hank Aaron Chasing The
Dream Foundation, an offshoot of Aaron's Youth Leadership
Foundation, has become his proudest achievement. The foundation
benefits underprivileged youths ages 9-12.
</P>
<P>
   But the game also seems to be seeking Aaron out. MLB helped
stage his gala 65th birthday party on Feb. 5, complete with
President Bill Clinton on the dais. If the McGwire-Sosa epic served
to return the spotlight to Aaron, it found a happier man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the tribute Feb. 5 speaks for itself,'' said Bill
Bartholomay, the Braves chairman of the board. ``I think what's
happening is, there is a little bit more of the history out there
now.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think baseball is different,'' Bartholomay said. ``Five
years after the labor stoppage, I think we're recognizing our
history a little bit better. People are doing things with their
baseball afterlife, and the kids are picking up on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Selig has made Aaron a personal initiative. He has done
extensive fund-raising work with the Milwaukee chapter of the
Chasing The Dream Foundation. The birthday bash, a virtual
coming-out party, bore the commissioner's fingerprints. He helped
deliver the host of baseball stars that attended.
</P>
<P>
   It all is in a stark contrast to previous baseball leadership.
Then-commissioner Bowie Kuhn was conspicuously absent the night
Aaron hit No. 715. He had made a commitment to address a Cleveland
Indians fans banquet that night, which sounds as hollow now as it
did then.
</P>
<P>
   ``What (Aaron) went through back then was so heart-breaking,''
Selig said. ``I'm so happy that, while he's alive and healthy, he
can enjoy the fruits and benefits of his great career.''
</P>
<P>
   The Aaron Award is a significant salute, for baseball has not
minted a new award since 1967. Aaron, making appearances around
major-league parks all season to help celebrate the 25th
anniversary of the home run record, also promotes the award by his
presence.
</P>
<P>
   After throwing out the first pitch in Seattle on Monday night,
he hugged Ken Griffey Jr., the current player Aaron believes to
have the best shot at 755, and the moment suggested nothing of an
aging star once angry with the world. Griffey, who turns 30 on Nov.
11, stands at 351 homers after just over 10 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Where previous MLB administrations saw nothing, Selig sees a way
to lock two baseball generations and help Aaron's legacy
simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're getting things done in a little more rational
manner now,'' Batholomay said. ``Let's put it that way. The
important thing is, it's being done.''
</P>
<P>
   Aaron admits to being ``a little more proud'' of his record now
than he once was. If he wasn't quite the hero Mantle or Mays or
even Ruth was, as some critics charged when he hit No. 715, he will
walk the field tonight with his star re-cast. Hank Aaron comes home
and his old friend Bud Selig will be there too.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been the greatest ride,'' Aaron said. ``I can say to
the fans, especially in the last 10 years, things have been just
wonderful for me.''

 &HT;    Teams' mantra on offensive line: Bigger is better
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Not until he arrived at Indianapolis for the NFL
scouting combine two months ago did San Jose State guard David
Loverne ever think of himself as anything but a big man on campus.
But as Loverne checked the other offensive linemen shoehorned into
a shuttle bus, he realized that he was the only one occupying just
one seat.
</P>
<P>
   At that moment, the 6-foot-3, 292-pound Loverne said, he felt
more like a graduate of Lilliput State.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those guys were absolute monsters,'' said Loverne, one of just
six offensive-line prospects under 300 pounds at the combine.
``They were some of the largest human beings I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   The pool of offensive linemen in this year's draft is both
gargantuan and good. In the eyes of scouts, bigger is better, and
this year, a prospect had better be bigger to gain attention.
</P>
<P>
   Retired New York Giants general manager George Young and Jets
coach Bill Parcells share what they call ``The Planet Theory'' _
there are a finite number of 300-pounders on Earth, and woe to the
team that ignores them in the draft. In the 1999 draft, however, it
might be difficult for a team to complete the proceedings without
landing at least one 300-pound blocker.
</P>
<P>
   ``There definitely are enough of them to go around,''
Philadelphia Eagles offensive line coach Keith Rowen said.
</P>
<P>
   Consider:
</P>
<P>
   _ The average weight of the 54 offensive linemen at the combine
was 317.5 pounds. The lightest of the prospects was 290 pounds and
there were 14 players 325 pounds or more and five 340 pounds or
more.
</P>
<P>
   _ The group had an average height of 6 feet 4 1/2, and just one
player was under 6-2. There were 13 players 6-6 or taller.
</P>
<P>
   _ UCLA tackle Kris Farris actually looked skinny at 6-7 7/8 and
313 pounds. Several scouts told John Tait of Brigham Young (6-6
1/8, 310), the consensus No. 1 prospect at tackle, that he should
add some upper-body bulk. Even though Aaron Gibson of Wisconsin was
a whopping 386 pounds, no one suggested he head for a sauna.
</P>
<P>
   ``Size matters,'' St. Louis offensive line coach Jim Hanifan
said. ``But it doesn't mean a thing if you can't play. These guys
are big and they can play. The quantity is there this year. It's
probably the deepest position in the draft.''
</P>
<P>
   NFL teams have selected 45 offensive linemen in the opening
round during the 1990s, second only to defensive linemen, 56. Not
since 1994 have fewer than five blockers gone off the board in
Round 1. Five or six probably will go in the opening round this
year,and even more in the second round.

 &HT;    Duval comes to Augusta on verge of greatness
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ Staring into a TV camera at the TPC at Sugarloaf
on Sunday night after an 11th win in 34 attempts, David Duval
seemed as perplexed as everyone else. Fess up, Double D. How does a
guy go from ``can't win'' to ``can't lose'' in 18 months?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what's going on,'' said Duval, Oakleys stowed on
his cap brim. ``I can't explain it.''
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the 63rd Masters, his colleagues were asking Duval
questions like, ``When are you going to take some more time off?''
and, ``What's your schedule for the rest of the year?''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, David, if you're skipping the Texas swing, point
me to the DFW Airport. Around putting greens and practice ranges
lately, they spare no hyperbole.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's probably having a better run than anybody I've seen on
Tour,'' Lee Janzen said. ``Not since Watson in the early '80s.
Maybe the mid-70s. It's just incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I read all those quotes last week about him coming to Atlanta
to warm up,'' Brad Faxon said. ``Now he's winning his warm-ups.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Calcavecchia said, ``I hate to compare him to Nicklaus, but
I really think he has the greatest mind since Nicklaus.''
</P>
<P>
   People who watch Duval on television and declare him robotic
should have been in the interview room Tuesday at Augusta National.
People remembering him from less mature days at Georgia Tech, once
holding the 54-hole lead of the BellSouth Classic, should have been
there, too. The new David Duval _ golf's No. 1 player on the
greatest run in two decades _ is joking and laughing as he lugs all
the loot to his Jacksonville Beach branch. He is confident, yet
modest. He will deflect any comparisons with Nicklaus or Palmer or
Miller. Nope, he hasn't done enough yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've won 11 out of probably 120,'' Duval said, drawing
reference to those now-ancient times, when he went winless for 92
events before October 1997. ``I might be in the process of being a
star or whatever, but not like Tiger (Woods),'' the 27-year-old
Duval said. ``Tiger is a star. Tiger is outside the game.''
</P>
<P>
   That could change today, as Duval, clearly installed as the
favorite, stalks his third tournament win in a row and a green
jacket.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's beating us every week, which is a negative for us,''
Janzen said, ``but the positive part is that he is showing us that
the sky's the limit.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Atlanta win, Duval hit only the range and the
short-game area Tuesday. He played 18 holes Wednesday morning and
then the par-3 tournament. The serious research came three weeks
ago during two rounds at Augusta National. On his first attempt at
the four altered holes and new rough, he shot a 5-under-par 67. The
second day he bogeyed the first five holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stopped keeping score,'' Duval said, laughing. ``I beat one
of the assistant (pros) and got beat by two of the others.''
</P>
<P>
   Ready to get started today, Duval also wants to build on last
year's Masters. Draining and disappointing as it was to finish a
stroke behind Mark O'Meara, Duval emerged without a need for
psychotherapy. The guy who won birdied three of the last four
holes; a bogey on 16 and two pars doesn't quite qualify as a
disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``What would I do differently? Seriously?'' Duval said. ``Have
him not make a 20-footer and I get in a playoff? Am I satisfied I
did everything I could? Absolutely. ... What it does is tell me
that I can win that golf tournament. I mean, there is no question
in my mind that I can win that golf tournament. Doesn't mean I'm
going to, but I have the ability to.''
</P>
<P>
   Everybody seems to agree. Paul Stankowski suggested last week
that Duval ``is our only shot for a Grand Slam.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval has done everything but win a major. He has shot a Sunday
59 to win. He has won four times in eight 1999 events. He has won
enough money to purchase the TV rights to the Masters, if not the
title itself. Interestingly, if Duval could have one shot to reload
last year, it would not be the ball at the 16th that remained on
the right slope, almost guaranteeing the final-round three-putt.
Worse was the birdie that got away at the par-3 fourth on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just brutal,'' he said. ``Front pin, right over the bunker. I
had it 3 feet straight up the hill, and I didn't even hit the
hole.''
</P>
<P>
   From a technical standpoint, he has improved his chipping and
putting greatly, combining them with a murderous long game. He is
leading the PGA Tour in seven categories _ money, scoring, birdies,
greens in regulation, putting, total driving and all-around. Beyond
that, Duval has learned not to force a shot when in contention or
fret over a bad one. When asked Tuesday why he is such a
``dullard,'' Duval laughed it off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other players might get fired up by getting upset,'' he said.
``That doesn't do me right. It doesn't serve me well. ... I can't
rehit a shot. I can only move forward.''
</P>
<P>
   When the final numbers are totaled, one-putts will mean more
than one-liners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a fan before I got on tour, and Tom Watson was my
favorite player,'' Janzen said. ``Watching him on TV, I thought he
was very quiet. Now that I know him, I don't think he's quiet at
all. ... I guess when David decides, everybody will get to know
him.

 &HT;    Lickliter's hard, long work results in him `living an absolute
dream'
 &HT;    By Ron Jackson and Lawrence Budd
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Franklin native Frank Lickliter Jr. tees off this
morning in his first Masters tournament nine years after a guard
refused to let him and his Wright State University golf teammates
onto the historic Augusta National golf course.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, the Raiders tried to visit the Masters course in
Georgia between rounds at a nearby college tournament. Augusta's
fabled fairways, lined with flowering azaleas, dogwoods and
magnolias, are an exclusive sight few golfers get to enjoy. All
Masters players have to be invited and tickets _ even to practice
rounds _ are just as hard to come by.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guard house was the closest we got. They didn't buy our
line that we wanted buy some things at pro shop,'' recalled coach
Fred Jefferson. ``The guard said, `We'll bring it out.' Frank and
the rest of the golfers were disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   For Lickliter, 29, matching strokes with the world's greatest
golfers at the first major tournament of the year represents the
latest _ and greatest _ proof that his years of practice are paying
off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just another step,'' said his dad, Frank Lickliter Sr.
``Actually he's treating the Masters like it's another tournament.
He thinks he belongs out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Lickliter began the journey to Augusta in earnest at 13, when he
resolved to become a professional golfer. During high school, he
spent endless hours driving golf balls into a makeshift driving
range his father built in the basement of their Main Street home.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made a lot of sacrifices. He didn't worry about the prom,
or homecoming or any dances. He didn't have a lot of dates in high
school. He was focused on golf. That was his passion,'' said his
mother, Maryann.
</P>
<P>
   As ``Frankie'' walks to the first tee at Augusta and hears the
roar of the crowd today, his parents will be there behind the
yellow ropes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is always a special thrill when they introduce him on the
first tee and announce he's from Franklin, Ohio. We're very proud
of that,'' his mother said.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than risk disturbing his son's concentration, the elder
Lickliters will weave through the gallery at Augusta National,
picking unobtrusive vantage points, usually half a hole ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to have anything to do with him during the
tournament. It's not good for him. Rarely do we speak during the
tournament,'' his dad said.
</P>
<P>
   Lickliter's father, a retired computer repairman at AK Steel,
could hardly afford a country-club membership. Father and son would
walk to nearby Anthony Wayne Elementary School for practice
sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I taught him anything, it was the value of practice and the
need to work on his game everyday. I taught him the work ethic,''
his father said.
</P>
<P>
   After Lickliter resolved to become a pro, his father bought him
a membership at the Shaker Run Golf Club in Turtlecreek Twp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him I would subsidize his golf if he played every
day,'' Lickliter said. ``He didn't have to worry about a summer
job. I still remember going to pick him up at Shaker and seeing a
solitary figure in the twilight on the driving range. It was always
Frankie working on his swing.''
</P>
<P>
   Lickliter still holds the Shaker Run course record, which he set
in 1994, needing only 65 strokes for 18 holes.
</P>
<P>
   As a freshman at Franklin High School, he earned the No. 1 spot
on the golf team.
</P>
<P>
   ``He worked harder than any athlete I coached in any other
sport. He was just relentless, even as freshman. He had a musty
basement and he and his father built a small driving range down
there where he would hit golf balls into the net year round,'' said
coach Kevin Hollon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other coaches and players were in awe of his hand and wrist
movement, even at that young age. What was surprising, he didn't
have the country-club upbringing,'' Hollon said.
</P>
<P>
   As a junior, Lickliter placed fourth in the state and led the
team to a sixth-place finish. In his senior year, he claimed the
district and regional individual titles and led the Wildcats to a
seventh-place state finish. He also placed seventh individually in
the state tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Beth Williams grew up with the Lickliter children.
</P>
<P>
   She recalled a statement a teen-age Lickliter scrawled on a
bedroom mirror in permanent ink: ``I can sink any putt.''
</P>
<P>
   At Wright State, Lickliter won seven Division I tournaments. He
was the first Wright State golfer to appear in the NCAA Division I
tournament (1989) and helped the Raiders become the university's
first team to participate in an NCAA Division I tournament (1990).
In 1996 he was inducted into the Wright State University Athletic
Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``He worked harder than any golfer we've had here. He was always
seeking out tougher competition and always learning. Some of the
drills I use for my golfers now I learned from Frank,'' the coach
said.
</P>
<P>
   From 1991 to 1995, Lickliter played the Nike Tour, the minor
league of pro golf. Occasionally he would turn to his parents for
help in making ends meet between paydays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankie had some hard times, living on a shoestring budget,''
his father said. ``There were times Maryann and I scraped up $1,000
for him to go to Florida and play. He'd call and say, `I'm down to
$200 and I would tell him to come home. It took him a little bit
longer than everybody else to reach the tour,'' said his father.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Lickliter won the Boise Open, a breakthrough victory
with a $45,000 purse, then graduated from the PGA's qualifying
school. In 1996, he joined the PGA Tour and last year he finished
45th on the money list.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Lickliter lives in an exclusive Gulf Coast golf community
in Florida, north of St. Petersburg, and enjoys a life of luxury.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is living an absolute dream,'' his father said. ``He's
living in a half-million dollar house in Sawgrass and drives a
$100,000 Hummer.''
</P>
<P>
   He is engaged to his secretary, Diane Owen.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Lickliter finished second, winning $302,400, at
1999 AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am.
</P>
<P>
   ``He signed over 500 autographs during that tournament,'' his
mother said with a proud smile. Family friend Norma Kennard said
she's hardly a golf fan, but plans to watch the Masters on TV
today.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are proud of him. He's spoken well for our small town,''
she said.

 &HT;    Family feel pervades par-3 tournament
 &HT;    By Michelle Hiskey
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Golf's most famous caddie has a new bag, but he didn't
carry it Wednesday. Mike ``Fluff'' Cowan, the mustachioed former
worker bee fired by Tiger Woods and hired by Jim Furyk, took the
afternoon off. In his place was the pro's freckled 15-year-old
cousin, Dave Furyk of South Park, Pa., shouldering the five clubs
needed in the Masters par-3 tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really a great experience, just being with my cousin _
and getting to putt on No. 9,'' said Dave, who got to roll a
10-footer. Not many people can say they did that at Augusta
National.
</P>
<P>
   The casual competition afforded players the chance to allow
their families and friends a walk inside the ropes. Stewart Cink's
father, Rob, from Alabama, tended the flag for him. Stefan Langer
caddied for dad Bernhard. Corey Pavin and Fred Funk walked up the
fairway with their little boys. Mark Calcavecchia's 9-year-old
daughter, Britney Jo, donned a small white jumpsuit, her blond hair
in a ponytail _ just like some of the regular caddies.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe a little bit of Fluff rubbed off on the whippersnappers.
Six-year-old Andrew Perry, who toted four clubs for his dad, Chris,
knew just how to spin his newfound fame. ``Do you want my
autograph?'' he piped up.
</P>
<P>
   Durant par-3 champ
</P>
<P>
   If the Masters jinx holds, Joe Durant will not win Sunday. He
won the par-3 tournament with a 5-under 22, and no player who has
won it has gone on to take the Masters. Gary Player, Scott Verplank
and Mark Brooks finished a stroke behind. Georgia Tech star Matt
Kuchar recovered enough from a stomach bug to ace the 55-yard
second hole. Fuzzy Zoeller holed out his tee shot on the ninth
hole. Tournament favorite David Duval, on the other hand, made sure
he was nowhere near the lead. He turned in a 14-over 41.
</P>
<P>
   Slower play expected
</P>
<P>
   Expect Thursday's threesomes to take as long as an hour longer
to complete the round than the traditional twosomes. The ``time
par'' for a threesome is 4 hours, 45 minutes, Masters competition
chairman Will F. Nicholson Jr. said. ``I don't think it's going to
be a five-hour round,'' Nicholson predicted. The move to threesomes
was made to accommodate the large 96-player field. Those groupings
remain the same Friday, with start times in reverse order, because
some pros requested a chance to play in the morning at least one
day so they could avoid spike marks on the greens.
</P>
<P>
   Tee times of note
</P>
<P>
   Gene Sarazen, 97, Byron Nelson, 87, and Sam Snead, 86, tee off
at 8 a.m. today as honorary starters. Here's when the golfers with
Georgia ties go off: Davis Love III of Sea Island, 9:32 a.m.; Matt
Kuchar of Georgia Tech, 10:16 a.m.; Larry Mize of Columbus, 10:49
a.m.; Tommy Aaron of Gainesville, 11 a.m.; Billy Andrade of
Atlanta, 1:01 p.m.; and Stewart Cink of Smyrna, 1:45 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Streaks alive
</P>
<P>
   Doug Ford adds to his record of most starts at the Masters _ 47
this week, while Arnold Palmer is only one behind. Billy Casper and
Gary Player will be playing their 42nd. All past winners attended
the Champions Dinner on Tuesday night, with no adverse reactions to
the sushi and sashimi appetizers ordered by defending champ Mark
O'Meara _ not even Sam Snead, who is more comfortable fishing with
bait, not eating it.

 &HT;    Lickliter a long way from Franklin, Ohio
 &HT;    By Gary Nuhn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ For golfers, this is the place you must be in
early-mid April to justify your existence. This is where
immortality awaits, here at Augusta National Golf Club, here among
the pines and the flowers and the ghosts.
</P>
<P>
   And thus did Frank Lickliter, having missed the cut last week at
the BellSouth Classic, drive down Magnolia Lane on Saturday in his
Hummer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Might be the first Hummer that's ever been on the grounds,''
said Steve Jones.
</P>
<P>
   And how did that drive feel?
</P>
<P>
   ``Another good day,'' Frank Lickliter said, ``in a good year.''
</P>
<P>
   A very good year. Three months into the season, the kid who grew
up in Franklin is 21st on the PGA Tour money list at $506,806.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember watching the Masters with my dad when I was a
kid,'' Lickliter said. ``It was even before I played golf. I
remember Fuzzy winning it. And Ballesteros.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be 1979 and 1980 when Lickliter was 9 and 10.
</P>
<P>
   He started playing when he was 13.
</P>
<P>
   Now it was Wednesday, a day before the 63rd Masters, and
Lickliter, 29, was standing in the Augusta National locker room,
hunched over his new putter with the sterling silver face that
famous craftsman Scotty Cameron spent a month making.
</P>
<P>
   Baby, won't you look at me now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey,'' he said to Rocco Mediate, ``it's got my initials on
it.''
</P>
<P>
   And there they were, on the putter head: ``F.L.''
</P>
<P>
   So I said, here's this kid from little Franklin, who grew up to
become Cinderella at the Masters, and he went into the Bill Murray
monologue from ``Caddyshack,'' complete with the faux-Scottish
accent.
</P>
<P>
   Lickliter qualified for his first Masters by finishing fourth at
last year's PGA. Mark O'Meara saw him in the locker room and said,
``Congratulations on making the Masters.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hadn't thought about it until then,'' Lickliter said. ``And
even after he said it, it didn't really sink in.''
</P>
<P>
   It sank in Saturday when he drove in off Washington Road and
down through the Magnolias and those huge above-ground roots that
stretch forever, just like the roots of this game.
</P>
<P>
   Impressed? Apparently.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I've driven in since then,'' Lickliter said, ``I've
come through Magnolia Lane. I haven't taken the back way to the
players' parking lot.''
</P>
<P>
   He knows Masters tradition, and as he has tapped into it during
his practice rounds.
</P>
<P>
   On No. 9, he studied where Greg Norman's ball hit next to the
cup in 1996, then spun 90 feet back off the green. ``Three feet
from being perfect,'' Lickliter said. ``A little greed out here can
be a bad thing.''
</P>
<P>
   At 10, he recalled the 60-foot sidewinding putt Ben Crenshaw
made in 1984 en route to victory. ``I looked at that line,''
Lickliter said, ``and I just thought, `Unbelievable.' ''
</P>
<P>
   At the 12th, in the middle of Amen Corner, he paused on the bank
in front of the green where Fred Couples' ball fell short, but
somehow stayed out of Rae's Creek in 1992 on his way to the
championship. ``I dropped a couple of balls right in that spot and
every one rolled into the creek,'' Lickliter said. ``I'll tell you
what: Freddie got lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   On 16, he walked in Jack Nicklaus' bear tracks from the
45-footer uphill that won it in 1975. ``I've seen that putt on Golf
Channel,'' Lickliter said. ``I love those old tournaments on Golf
Channel.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight years out of Wright State; Hummer in the parking lot;
Cinderella at the Masters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a dream,'' Frank Lickliter said, 25 hours from his
12:50 p.m. Thursday tee time. ``I'm lucky enough to be living a
dream.

SPORTS COLUMN: EISENHOWER TREE RE-EMERGES AS FACTOR IN THE MASTERS
</HEADLINE>
   (See also GLF-MASTERS) 
(rk) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA , Ga. _ Of the thousands of trees that decorate the
Masters at Augusta National, it's the only one with a name: the
Eisenhower Tree, or Ike's Tree.
</P>
<P>
   It's a big, wide loblolly pine with sprawling boughs that, from
the 17th tee, blocks the left side of the fairway the way Shaquille
O'Neal blocks the lane. And when Dwight D. Eisenhower was president
of the United States and an Augusta National member, his tee shot
there invariably plunked into that tree.
</P>
<P>
   At a 1956 board meeting, the president even stood up and
demanded that the tree be chopped down. Hearing that, Clifford
Roberts, then the club's crusty chairman, quickly adjourned the
meeting. ``To protect the club's property,'' Roberts explained.
</P>
<P>
   So much for the power of the presidency at Augusta National, but
the president's name was instantly attached to that tree. And now,
with the tee moved back 25 yards this year on what is now the
425-yard 17th hole, the Eisenhower Tree is suddenly as intimidating
to the Masters golfers as it was to the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before,'' Tiger Woods was saying on Tuesday, ``I never thought
about that tree.'
</P>
<P>
   Precisely the point. Until this year, Woods, John Daly, David
Duval and golf's other long hitters would bomb their tee shots
above and beyond the Eisenhower Tree as if it weren't even there.
</P>
<P>
   Now the long hitters must think about making sure their tee
shots soar above it. And the shorter hitters must make sure to keep
their tee shots out where the fairway curls around it. ``I probably
can't hit it over the Eisenhower Tree now,'' said Mark O'Meara, who
birdied the 17th and 18th holes to win last year. ``I probably have
to work around it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Masters' most significant hole alterations in one year,
the golfers now must stop and think and maybe think again on No. 2,
No. 11, No. 15 and No. 17 instead of just swinging away.
</P>
<P>
   And for the first time, Augusta National has grown some rough to
make the golfers think even more.
</P>
<P>
   Cut at a neat one and three-eighths inches, it's hardly the four
to five inches of thick, tangled rough at a United States Open, but
it's enough to both hurt and help _ to make the golfers stop and
think, especially on their shots out of the rough to the green, and
to keep a wandering tee shot from bounding too far into the
slippery pine straw.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ball's not going to go as far,'' Fred Couples said, ``but
it'll be tough judging your second shots.''
</P>
<P>
   With a new tee adding 25 yards, No. 2 is now 575 yards, but only
Woods, Daly, Duval and the other long hitters are likely to risk
drawing their tee shots beyond the gaping bunker 325 yards away at
the right corner of the par-5 dogleg left.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they can hit a perfect drive down the hill on the left
side, more power to them,'' said Tom Fazio, the Masters' consulting
architect. ``If not, they're either in trouble or it's now a much
longer second shot.''
</P>
<P>
   At No. 11, still a 455-yard downhill par-4, the green has been
raised 2 feet to avert a repeat of the flood that washed out the
green in 1990 when Rae's Creek overflowed. The green was also
extended to create a treacherous back-left pin position.
</P>
<P>
   At No. 15, the par-5 of 485 yards where Gene Sarazen's
double-eagle two in 1935 soared over the pond in front of the
green, 20 loblolly pines averaging 35 feet in height were installed
to the right of the fairway, out where most tee shots land.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mounds on the right side of that fairway are gone,'' Fazio
said. ``The big hitters used to slingshot their tee shots off those
mounds. And if they're in or behind those trees on the right, they
probably won't have a shot to the green.''
</P>
<P>
   Those trees should be a new factor, especially Sunday when the
Masters boils down to the closing holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea was not only to make 15 play a little longer,'' Fazio
said, ``but also to narrow the width of the ideal landing area, at
least in the minds of the golfers.''
</P>
<P>
   And when the leaders get to the 17th tee on Sunday, they will be
staring at the Eisenhower Tree.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 17th hole has needed something,'' said Jack Nicklaus, the
six-time Masters winner who will not be playing this week while he
recuperates from hip surgery. ``The 17th has been playing too short
and too easy for a 17th hole for quite a few years.''
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere, President Eisenhower must be chuckling.  &QL;

 &HT;    Limit on contributions pending in House
 &HT;    By Scott S. Greenberger
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Undaunted by constitutional restrictions and a
skeptical House speaker, supporters of campaign contribution lmits
testified Wednesday that caps are the only way to dissipate a cloud
of corruption hovering over Texas politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point you have to ask: Are these sums of money so
obscene that there's an appearance of corruption in the entire
system?'' said Frank Newton, dean of the Texas Tech School of Law.
</P>
<P>
   Newton and a parade of activists from government watchdog groups
urged the House Elections Committee to endorse a bill filed by Rep.
Tom Uher (D-Bay City), which would limit contributions in races for
the Texas House and Senate. The House Committee on Elections left
the bill pending.
</P>
<P>
   Many believe that large contributors have too much influence on
the political process in Texas. Some suggest that even if there
isn't a direct link between contributions and public policy, the
appearance of corruption dampens political participation.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents argue that limiting contributions is akin to
restricting free speech, and that limits would benefit wealthy
candidates willing to pump their own money into a campaign. Efforts
to enact contribution limits in Texas _ one of a handful of states
without them _ have foundered in recent legislative sessions, and
the Uher bill faces long odds.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Pete Laney pointed to campaign finance reform as
one of his top priorities at the beginning of the session, but he
said last month that ``there's probably not enough folks in either
house'' to pass a contribution limit. Instead, Laney said, the
Legislature should concentrate on improving disclosure laws.
</P>
<P>
   Uher's bill also has to pass constitutional muster: The U.S.
Supreme Court has ruled that contribution limits can be
unconstitutional if set too low. The Uher measure debated Wednesday
would put a $1,000 cap per election on individual House
contributions to House candidates or political action committees.
The limit for Senate candidates would be $2,000. Newton and other
supporters said the limits in the Uher bill are in line with caps
in other states that have withstood legal challenge.
</P>
<P>
   But one member of the committee, Rep. Jerry Madden
(R-Richardson), said he believes that any contribution limits
``break into someone's right to participate in the process.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I honestly believe that disclosure is the best way,'' Madden
said.
</P>
<P>
   At an early morning news conference, Madden joined
representatives and senators of both parties to endorse bills that
would require electronic filing of campaign finance records, which
would then be posted on the Internet.

MENDOZA STARTS THINGS ROLLING AND IRABU WRAPS IT UP AS YANKEES TOP
A'S
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Ramiro Mendoza will return to the Yankees'
bullpen once Hideki Irabu's probation expires and Andy Pettitte
recovers from his various injuries. The Yankees are undoubtedly a
better team with the versatile and durable Mendoza available in
relief, after all.
</P>
<P>
   But they are pretty good when Mendoza starts, too. He pitched
eight scoreless innings, allowing only five singles and a walk in
the Yankees' 4-0 shutout of the Oakland Athletics Wednesday. And,
Mendoza justified manager Don Zimmer's decision to start him
instead of Irabu.
</P>
<P>
   But Irabu had a small share of satisfaction, as well, pitching
the final inning and twice moving to cover first base on ground
balls to the right side, with a smile on his face.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' starting pitching is a potential weakness: Pettitte
is on the disabled list; Irabu is effectively imprisoned in the
bullpen because of his recent misdeeds, and the 30-something aces,
Roger Clemens and David Cone, are holding up the staff.
</P>
<P>
   But the starting pitching, which anchored the 125-victory season
in 1998, was spectacular in the first three days here: Clemens,
Orlando Hernandez and Mendoza permitted only 12 hits and six runs
in 212/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   After Irabu pitched the ninth inning, the Yankees gulped down
ribs and beans on plastic plates and headed home. They will play
their home opener Friday against the Detroit Tigers, with David
Cone pitching against Beiker Graterol, a 24-year-old player who has
spent six seasons in the minor leagues and has never seen Yankee
Stadium in person.
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza's turn in the rotation does not come up again until
April 13, but Irabu might pitch then, and barring injury, Mendoza
could be back in the bullpen by month's end.
</P>
<P>
   Not that he deserves such a fate. Joe Torre, the Yankees'
manager, argued last June that Mendoza did nothing to lose his spot
in the rotation, but Hernandez supplanted him anyway through an
executive order, and the Yankees were a better team as a result.
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza has grumbled privately about his fate, but never
outwardly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will say this: With the game he pitched today, he's liable
to have something to say,'' Zimmer said. ``He hasn't done much of
anything wrong since he's been here.''
</P>
<P>
   Derek Jeter said: ``Mendoza can pitch. He knows he can pitch.
Everybody knows he can pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Yankees love to play behind him, because of his
machine-gun style of pitching, firing strikes one after another,
working fast and forcing opposing hitters to swing. Mendoza threw
only 104 pitches in his eight innings, 13 pitches an inning. The
American League average last year was 16 pitches an inning.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching in this way, second baseman Chuck Knoblauch said,
``keeps your defense in the game,'' makes them concentrate and
anticipate with each pitch knowing there is a very good chance the
ball will be hit to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why you saw some plays being made that were
extraordinary,'' Knoblauch said.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch, who made three great plays in Tuesday's 7-4 victory,
took a hit away from Ben Grieve in the fifth inning Wednesday.
Jeter ranged far to his left to rob Tony Phillips in the sixth.
Oakland had a runner at first and one out in the fifth, with the
Yankees leading 3-0, when A.J. Hinch slugged a long drive to deep
center.
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Williams got a good jump on the ball, but it still
appeared as if the ball had gone over his head _ until he reached
up with his glove hand, on a dead run, and speared the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza said he was a little tired in the eighth, with his pitch
count nearing 100, and with two outs and a runner at first,
Phillips smashed a high drive toward the left-field corner.
</P>
<P>
   But Chad Curtis tracked the ball, sprinting, glancing at the
wall he was charging and then at Phillips' liner, back and forth,
until he caught the ball a step in front of the fence, banging into
the wall. The defense, Mendoza suggested later, was the difference
in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Irabu started warming up during the eighth inning, and the way
Zimmer figured it, if Irabu could pitch an inning with a
respectable lead, maybe he would have a chance to get his
confidence back and regain some confidence in the eyes of his
teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza got through the eighth with a 4-0 edge, and Irabu was
waved into the game for the bottom of the ninth. He threw hard and
pitched well. It was his first step out of purgatory. And the first
step toward the return of Mendoza to the bullpen, in spite of his
success.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very good today,'' Irabu said. ``He was great.''

DUVAL SETS STANDARD AT THE MASTERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ Augusta National Golf Course has two sides.
There's the one the public sees, and the one you have to get close
to if you are to appreciate it.
</P>
<P>
   Which makes Augusta National the perfect analogy for the two
golfers most likely to subdue her this week.
</P>
<P>
   The back nine (second nine in Masters-speak) you've surely seen.
Only Tiger Woods' smile is more photogenic. It is Amen Corner and
Gene Sarazen's double eagle 2.
</P>
<P>
   The first nine is inscrutable. It is an elevated tee and tilted
greens and Bruce Devlin's double eagle 2.
</P>
<P>
   When you think of the Masters, you think of Augusta National's
back nine because the tournament committee _ which contours the
television coverage _ deigns it so. Likewise, when you think of
golf superstars you think of Woods because a mighty marketing
machine has dictated that you do.
</P>
<P>
   The truth? The front nine deserves your attention and so does
David Duval, who is playing so well you wouldn't be at all
surprised to see him eschew the Hogan Bridge at the 12th green and
walk across Rae's Creek.
</P>
<P>
   Duval has played in eight tournaments in 1999 and prevailed in
four, his .500 winning percentage unsurpassed by either Woods, the
Washington Capitals, the Phoenix Suns, the Cincinnati Reds, Silver
Charm, NATO forces in Kosovo or FOX network programmers.
</P>
<P>
   No one who drives for dough, with the possible exception of Jeff
Gordon, has kept pace with Duval, who has finished first in 11 of
his past 34 starts. He is one of only three players over the past
30 years to win at least three PGA Tournaments in three consecutive
years, joining Jack Nicklaus and Tom Watson, both future Hall of
Famers.
</P>
<P>
   And yet when it comes to owning Madison Avenue, Duval is a few
signatures shy of a deed. When Woods turned professional after his
sophomore year at Stanford he enlisted the services of agent Hughes
Norton who, in turn, removed Duval from his client Rolodex, the
better to concentrate on making Woods rich and famous.
</P>
<P>
   He succeeded so well that Woods last year deemed him expendable,
removing Norton from his Rolodex. Woods can _ and does _ turn his
charisma on and off like a television camera, smiling when it suits
him and scowling when it doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   Duval is different. He learned at a painfully early age that
life itself is the richest reward.
</P>
<P>
   When he was 9, his 12-year-old brother Brent was diagnosed with
a blood disorder. Duval donated bone marrow in an effort to save
his brother's life but Brent's body rejected it and five months
later he died, in May of 1981.
</P>
<P>
   If smiles for the longest time were hard for Duval to
manufacture, can you blame him?
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Woods, who wears his emotions like endorsements, Duval
continues to keep his feelings largely under wraps. That doesn't
mean he's unapproachable and it shouldn't make him unmarketable.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe in his next life Duval will be an air traffic controller.
He certainly was unflappable the other day when he sat down in the
interview room and the first question posed to him was not really a
question at all:
</P>
<P>
   ``There's kind of a perception out there that you're somewhat of
a dullard.''
</P>
<P>
   That would have been the end of the interview session for a lot
of athletes. Not Duval. After a long pause, the man who oozes so
little emotion exuded a lot of character.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's the perception, that's fine,'' he said evenly.
``That's how I try to play. I try not to make mistakes ... I try to
keep the stress level as minimal as I can.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 Woods won his first (and only) major here in startling
fashion. His 12-stroke victory sent his marketing machine into
overdrive and sent Masters officials scurrying to the drawing board
to ``Tiger-proof'' the course.
</P>
<P>
   Woods has four PGA victories since then. Duval has posted that
many victories in the past three months. The way he has been
playing, the only way to Duval-proof any course, including Augusta
National, might be to plant more flowers and pray the pollen rouses
the allergies that prompted Duval to don the wraparound sunglasses
that have become his trademark.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might be in the process of becoming a golf star or whatever
you want to call it,'' Duval said. ``But I'm not like Tiger in the
sense that Tiger is a star. He (transcends) the game. I don't see
myself that way and I don't think I ever will.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I might seem uncomfortable (with the concept).''
</P>
<P>
   Goodness knows you can find, without too much fuss, professional
athletes with far worse failings than that. That Duval is the No. 1
golfer on the planet and feels undeserving of a pedestal may be all
the more reason he belongs there.
</P>

 &HT;    Anti-gang bills approved in Texas
 &HT;    By Mike Ward
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Six bills designed to curb Texas' growing crime
wave from prison and street gangs were approved Wednesday, even as
a legislative fight surfaced over a key element of the crackdown _
the creation of a statewide computer network to track gang members.
</P>
<P>
   During a three-hour hearing at the Capitol, a standing-room-only
crowd of law enforcement officials from across Texas argued against
giving locally elected officials such as city councils a say in
whether to participate in the network.
</P>
<P>
   And the Senate Criminal Justice Committee obliged, deleting a
provision that would have allowed for local public hearings on the
issue. But state Sen. Royce West, author of the anti-gang bills,
said he intends to raise the issue again when the bills are debated
by the full Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very important issue _ what kind of information
would be kept, whether it should be kept at all _ and I think that
should be the subject of lively and spirited debate on the local
level,'' said West (D-Dallas). ``I think this database is a key
part of dealing with these gangs. But there are issues of privacy
and of checks and balances that we must also address.''
</P>
<P>
   Under West's original bill, city councils and county
commissioners' courts could have opted not to join the computer
network. And once they were part of it, they could not have pulled
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The meat and potatoes of gang enforcement in Texas is gang
intelligence . . . the database, the files, the photos, the
information that allows officers to track and investigate cases,''
said Kim Ogg, head of the Houston mayor's anti-gang office.
``There's much more at stake here than just a gang database.''
</P>
<P>
   Explained Chuck Brawner, president of the Texas Municipal Police
Association: ``If we allow local governments the option of opting
out . . . we will not have a statewide database.''
</P>
<P>
   Much the same sentiment was echoed by Sgt. Wes McBride, head of
gang enforcement for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department,
whose computer network is one of several prototypes for what Texas
wants to create.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no other group in this country that kills and maims
as much as criminal street gangs,'' he said. ``Cities and towns
that opt out (in California) . . . become sanctuaries for gang
members.''
</P>
<P>
   Under current Texas law, local police departments and sheriff's
offices are allowed to keep their own files on gang members but
there is no statewide network of that information. But because that
law expires in September, a new law allowing those files must be
passed _ or they will all have to be destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   While most police officials opposed the computer database bill
at Wednesday's hearing _ they disliked provisions that would have
allowed adults listed in the database as gang members to challenge
that in court, and cautioned against letting privacy concerns
outweigh police needs _ they overwhelmingly supported the other
five elements of the anti-gang plan.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmen from Austin to Dallas to Houston to Corpus Christi
attended the lengthy Wednesday hearing, underscoring the importance
of the gang issue _ and the bills _ in the legislative session. A
key program of the current legislative session, the anti-gang plan
was prompted by a two-year study by a Senate panel headed by West
of Texas' growing problem with gangs _ criminal street groups and
prison gangs that police say now include more than 84,000 members
statewide.
</P>
<P>
   Unanimously approved by the committee were bills that would
require prison officials to notify local lawmen when prison gang
members are released from prison, would bolster training so parole
officers can more closely supervise prison gang members once they
are freed from behind bars, create a statewide police task force to
track gangs and would create a restricted Internet site to allow
police to better exchange investigative tips about gangs.
</P>
<P>
   Also approved was a bill that would make it a crime for the
first time to solicit membership in a criminal street gang.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas needs to be proactive against gangs, certainly, but I am
also aware of abuses by a minority of law enforcement agencies who
_ how shall I say it _ have invaded the privacy rights of
individuals and we need to have a system of checks and balances to
prevent that,'' West said. ``Inclusion in this database should be
based on conduct, not on characteristics.

SPORTS COLUMN: DON ZIMMER IS NO MERE CARETAKER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Ohio, Mass.)  (mk) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ The Yankees return for their home opener with
two victories and one loss. And by the way, who gets credit for the
Yankee record until Joe Torre comes back?
</P>
<P>
   Don Zimmer gave his opinion Wednesday with the wisdom of Solomon
_ and not Solomon Hemus, the former manager of the Cardinals,
either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe gets the wins; I get the losses,'' Zimmer decided.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it is not up to Zimmer to cede the good side of the
record to his buddy, who is recuperating from cancer surgery. The
Elias Sports Bureau, record-keeper to the world, will have the
final say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every case is different,'' said Steve Hirdt of Elias
Wednesday. ``It's not just a matter of who calls the hit-and-run
play. If somebody doesn't manage for a day because his daughter is
graduating from school, he's still the manager. We'll wait until
the situation resolves itself to make a decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre will be back in a couple of weeks, and Zim portrays
himself as a mere seat-warmer, but the old passion has kicked in.
</P>
<P>
   He is so intense about managing that his body quivered at the
end of Tuesday night's game, his breathing shallow, his voice
husky. He has called for daring plays on the bases, he has made
hunch decisions about his left fielder, and he stuck with Ramiro
Mendoza Wednesday, even when The Boss of All Bosses seemed to be
pushing for his new best friend, Hideki Irabu.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer's instincts were perfect. Mendoza pitched eight scoreless
innings and then Zimmer used Irabu in the ninth inning and received
three straight outs to wrap up a 4-0 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like it was 10-0,'' Zimmer said later, of his trust
for Irabu. ``It was 4-0. Things can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing happened, and Zimmer did not gloat about winning a game
with the more prepared pitcher while rehabilitating the psyche of
another pitcher. In his mind, he merely supervised another victory
for Torre's record.
</P>
<P>
   But underneath? You could hear the old boy's heart thumping.
After trying to hold back his emotions, Zimmer has allowed himself
to be what he is, a throwback to the old days when managers
actually sat around and talked baseball rather than give tight,
little press availabilities.
</P>
<P>
   With his garrulous streak and his slight limp from an arthritic
knee, Zimmer is starting to blur with Casey Stengel, for whom he
played one historic month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can make a living telling the truth,'' Casey used to say.
</P>
<P>
   When told he is sounding more and more like Casey, Zimmer said,
``That's a compliment,'' and indeed it is. He played for Casey in
the spring of 1962, for the Worst Team in the History of Baseball _
Casey won 40 but the Mets lost 120.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit the dog out of the ball in spring training and Casey
kept smiling at me like I was gonna hit .400,'' Zimmer recalled.
``I got one hit on opening day and we lost. I got one hit the next
day and we lost. Then I went 0 for 30 and we still lost.''
</P>
<P>
   One day, Zimmer recalled, he was in the shower, and Casey showed
up and gave an elaborate wink.
</P>
<P>
   ``Casey said something like, `You're gonna like it, short-center
field, it's good for you,'' and I said, `Casey, I don't know what
in the world you're talking about,' and he said, `Oops, I forgot to
tell you, we just traded you to Cincinnati.'''
</P>
<P>
   It was good for Zimmer. Nobody knew it, but his father was ill,
and he got to play at home for the rest of the season. He said he
has been lucky like that all his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I managed at Fenway Park; I managed at Wrigley Field'' _ and
tomorrow he manages in Yankee Stadium, 51 years after his first
opening day.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't remember his first game at Cambridge, Md., in the old
Eastern Shore League, ``but I sure as heck remember the third game.
I couldn't hold onto a ball, and finally I snagged one and I threw
it clear up against the outhouse behind first base.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sending the local paper to my father back home in
Cincinnati and he called me and said, `Your third game in pro ball,
and you've already set a league record _ six errors in one game.'''
</P>
<P>
   Now it is 51 years later, and Zimmer is opening another season.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know how ballplayers are out day by day?'' Zimmer said.
``That's the way it is with me. I just want to make it to May 1.''
</P>
<P>
   He will turn the team over to Torre, but he will privately
relish these precious days, when he got to do something he still
loves so much.

U.S. WARNS ON ANTIGUA MONEY LAUNDERING
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Treasury Department warned banks Wednesday to
be especially careful of financial transactions routed through
Antigua and Barbuda, saying that changes in the Caribbean nation's
law ``threaten to create a haven for money laundering.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before the changes, the operations of about 50 offshore
banks in the Caribbean islands had been watched with suspicion by
U.S. officials, James E. Johnson, the undersecretary for
enforcement, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, the islands weakened their anti-money-laundering
law, to the dismay of American officials. Amendments heightened
bank secrecy, hobbled investigators and put up obstacles to
international cooperation, Johnson said. Supervision of the
offshore banks was entrusted to a new agency, the International
Financial Sector Authority, whose six-member board includes four
executives from the offshore banks being regulated _ a conflict of
interest that invites abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, the Embassy of Antigua and Barbuda issued a
statement acknowledging the Treasury Department's concerns. Prime
Minister Lester Bird said his government had set up a committee to
propose changes in the law to satisfy American concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said the status of money-laundering enforcement is
watched by big narcotics traffickers. ``If you're a narcotics
trafficker, you can move your drugs and never get any powder on
your fingers and profit tremendously,'' he said. ``But money tends
to stick.''
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, he said, banking laws that make it easier for a
trafficker to do business with hard-to-trace money are the bane of
law enforcement, adding that lax banking laws also increase the
danger of bank frauds involving millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said Treasury officials hoped that Antigua and Barbuda,
a former British colony of about 64,000 people situated southeast
of Puerto Rico, would reverse course and toughen its law.
</P>
<P>
   In the embassy statement, Bird said his government did not want
to antagonize the United States, ``but at the same time we would
like the offshore financial sector to serve our economic
interest.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We would welcome the help of the United States in achieving
this objective,'' he added.

JUDGE RULES U.S. PENSION GUARANTOR CAN BE SUED BY WORKERS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   After reading a memo leaked by a whistle-blower, a federal judge
reversed her opinion Wednesday and ruled that the federal agency
that takes over failed pension plans has a responsibility of
loyalty to workers in such plans and can be sued for violating that
duty.
</P>
<P>
   The memo showed that the agency, the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corp., organizes its budget and regards its activities differently
from the way it had presented itself in court while defending
against a lawsuit brought by the Association of Former Pan Am
Employees.
</P>
<P>
   The association contends that the agency has delayed determining
how much its members are due and has shortchanged them hundreds of
millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an important victory for people in failed pension
plans who can now sue to remove'' the pension agency if it does not
fulfill its duty of loyalty, said Harvey M. Katz of New York, the
lawyer for the association.
</P>
<P>
   The pension agency has repeatedly sought to dismiss the
class-action lawsuit on the ground that it operates as a government
agency and is not subject to the duty of loyalty imposed on private
companies as pension plan trustees.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1998, Judge Loretta A. Preska of U.S. District Court
in Manhattan threw out all but one of the claims that the pension
agency stands in the same shoes as any other pension-plan trustee
and is therefore subject to the Employee Income Retirement Security
Act, the 1974 law that regulates pension plans.
</P>
<P>
   In all but one area she accepted the agency's argument that it
operates as an arm of the government in most activities and ruled
that it was largely immune from such litigation.
</P>
<P>
   But in a five-page opinion issued Wednesday, Preska said she was
reversing herself after reading the leaked memo. The memo, the
judge wrote, suggested that the pension agency ``itself views
benefit calculation as a trustee function'' that is separate from
its government functions.
</P>
<P>
   The memo was leaked by an employee of the pension agency who is
known only as Jim Dough. The employee, together with the Pan Am
employees association, is pressing a separate federal suit in
Baltimore on behalf of the pension agency against one of its
biggest contractors after accusations of overbilling.
</P>
<P>
   Preska's ruling is the latest blow to the agency, which was
harshly criticized last month by its inspector general and which
will be the subject this summer of Senate hearings into delays in
determining the benefits due the 450,000 workers in the failed
pensions plans it administers.
</P>
<P>
   The Pan Am employees association is suing the pension agency,
saying that eight years after the airline filed for bankruptcy is
too long for many of its 45,000 members to be told how much they
are due so they can begin appealing the benefit determinations..
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The agency's executive director, David M. Strauss, traveled to
Las Vegas, Nev., and New York a year ago to lobby with labor
leaders to cut off financing for the lawsuit, which he said lacked
merit.
</P>
<P>
   James Keightley, the pension agency's general counsel, said
Wednesday that it ``has fulfilled all of its obligations under the
law to Pan Am participants'' and that ``we are confident that,
after further review, the court will find that claims of fiduciary
breach are without merit.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that by the end of this month, the last benefit
determinations should be issued to participants in the largest Pan
Am plan, and he noted that the pension agency was paying $100
million a year in benefits to 16,000 former Pan Am workers.
</P>
<P>
   The agency says that most of the problems addressed in the
lawsuit and the inspector general reports were inherited from
President George Bush's administration and that they are being
aggressively resolved under the Clinton administration.

WASHINGTON RELIEF AGENCIES SEE SUFFERING UP CLOSE

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ During the day, John Schenk says his new surroundings
look positively inviting: sun-splashed sidewalk cafes at which to
lounge and Mediterranean temperatures with which to warm his
Northwest-chilled bones.
</P>
<P>
   But distance or darkness shatters that image of Podgorica,
Montenegro. A few hours away in the mountains, refugees from Kosovo
huddle on the concrete floors of factories and crowd into mosques
for shelter, driven out of their homeland by Serb forces. At night,
war comes to Podgorica _ NATO bombs exploded Tuesday in the middle
of the Montenegrin capital and set hillsides aflame outside the
city.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bit of a tinderbox,'' Schenk, a Tacoma resident, said
Wednesday by telephone from Podgorica. But a tinderbox in need of
relief. That's where Schenk comes in.
</P>
<P>
   Schenk works for World Vision, a charity based in Federal Way,
Wash.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the response to support Schenk's work and that of other
World Vision workers has been strong, said spokesman Dean Owen.
</P>
<P>
   The results have been much the same at World Concern, a charity
based in North Seattle. ``My phones have been ringing off the hook
here,'' said Rick Dennler, who was answering calls Wednesday. ``The
response has been tremendous as far as the outpouring of people who
want to contribute. From my perspective, it seems to be every bit
as a good as the response to Hurricane Mitch.''
</P>
<P>
   People have been donating blankets, clothing and other items,
supplies that will be packed and sent to a network of churches in
Albania and Macedonia for distribution.
</P>
<P>
   What's spurring the giving is simple, Kelly Miller said from the
World Concern warehouse. Images of human suffering on newspaper
front pages and the nightly television news have touched people.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tell a story,'' Miller said, ``and people respond.''
</P>
<P>
   For John Schenk, 50, the images only begin to tell the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are exhausted and traumatized when they arrive here,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   He met one group of nine people who traveled for 30 hours in
winter weather, over mountains and without sleep, to escape Serb
forces in Kosovo. The oldest member of the group was a 64-year-old
woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``So you can imagine the state the people are in when they
arrive,'' Schenk, 50, said.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of Montenegro have opened their homes, businesses and
churches to refugees, Schenk said.
</P>
<P>
   World Vision is trying to supply people with food, blankets and
the basics of human sanitation. Making the job harder is that
relief flights from the West aren't getting into Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to get supplies in country, but it's getting scarcer
and scarcer,'' he said. ``Prices in the stores have doubled in the
last few days.''
</P>
<P>
   One plan is to buy enough flour and yeast to provide bread to
2,500 people for two weeks. Tuesday, World Vision had found a
seller for 20 tons of flour.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, someone ``bought it out from under us,'' Schenk
said.
</P>
<P>
   World Vision is putting together family packs of food to feed
seven people for a week and trying to line up woodstoves, pots and
cooking utensils.
</P>
<P>
   Relief workers like Schenk also watch their backs. ``We're
maintaining a very low profile.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S government has urged Americans to get out of Montenegro,
and the Montenegrin government has suggested the same thing, saying
it can't guarantee their safety.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Yugoslav troops loyal to President Slobodan Milosevic
have moved into residential neighborhoods in Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   Schenk is a Canadian, but, he says, that may not make much
difference. ``People don't ask you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel vulnerable. If we start feeling profoundly unsafe, then
we will be leaving. Right now it just requires somes wisdom and
prudence.''
</P>
<P>
   World Vision is well on its way to raising the $2 million it
needs for Kosovo relief, Owen said. In addition to Montenegro, the
relief agency hopes to be up and running with an operation in
Albania by the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
   World Vision is only accepting donations of money. Wednesday, it
was getting 40 to 50 calls an hour from contributors. In the past
week, callers and those using its Internet site have contributed
$300,000 in the United States and $140,000 in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   World Vision can be reached at 888-511-6565 or at
www.worldvision.org.
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle, World Concern is using contributions of money to buy
items like infant formula. But it is also accepting goods. The
charity especially needs new baby bottles and nipples and
disposable diapers. It also needs blankets and clothing, especially
shoes, socks and underwear.
</P>
<P>
   World Concern's cash donation number is 800-739-9800. Its Web
site is www.worldconcern.org.

POLICE SAY MAN IN CUSTODY MAY HAVE COMMITTED 51 RAPES
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ANDREW JACOBS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A 38-year-old man who the police say may be
responsible for the largest series of rapes in recent years was
arrested and charged in four of those attacks Wednesday, the
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The man, Issaac Jones, who investigators say may have attacked
as many as 51 women in the Bronx, upper Manhattan and Mount Vernon
in Westchester County since 1993, was captured Tuesday afternoon as
he tried to sell a Bronx pawnbroker several pieces of jewelry he
had stolen from one victim, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   It was during the search for a suspect in the rapes that four
officers from the Police Department's Street Crime Unit shot and
killed Amadou Diallo on Feb. 4 as he entered his home in the
Soundview section.
</P>
<P>
   When Jones was caught, he was with a woman whom Police
Commissioner Howard Safir described as an associate. Jones, who has
been charged with four counts of rape and eight counts of robbery,
violently assaulted and robbed many of his victims, who ranged from
age 13 to 53, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has confessed to the crimes that he has been charged
with,'' Safir said at a news conference. ``Debriefing is
continuing.'' Jones voluntarily gave investigators a blood sample,
and Safir said that results of a DNA analysis would probably link
him to the other attacks, which were marked in part by the
distinctive method of the crimes. He said 17 of the unsolved rapes
had already been linked by DNA.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said that Jones was previously convicted of sodomy
in 1983 and robbery in 1989. He was released from prison in 1993,
and remained on parole until 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The police said the first of the series of rapes occurred in
August 1993 and that the most recent one was this Valentine's Day,
when two women were sexually assaulted and robbed in the elevator
of their building in the Washington Heights section of Manhattan.

JURY AT CONSPIRACY TRIAL SHOWN FLIGHT 800 SEATS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va.)   (nk) 
 By JOHN T. McQUISTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ The twisted remains of four passenger seats
from the wreckage of Trans World Airlines Flight 800, which
exploded and crashed off Long Island in 1996, were entered as
evidence Wednesday in the trial of a couple charged with conspiring
to steal parts of the wreckage to prove their theory that the
jetliner was downed by an errant Navy missile.
</P>
<P>
   ``They look like seats from Flight 800,'' said Capt. Terrell
Stacey, a former TWA pilot, as he stepped from the witness stand to
take a closer look at the shredded metal and foam. Stacey appeared
as the chief government witness against the defendants, James
Sanders, 53, and his wife, Elizabeth, 52, of Williamsburg, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Stacey told the jury in federal District Court here that he had
stolen the seating material from a government hangar in Calverton,
on Long Island, at the repeated insistence of the Sanderses. He
said the Sanderses wanted the material because it contained a
powdery reddish-orange substance that they believed was evidence of
a missile explosion. The government, which has rejected the missile
theory, says its tests proved that the powder was fabric glue.
</P>
<P>
   The Sanderses are charged with conspiring with Stacey and then
helping him to steal the pieces of wreckage. If found guilty, they
face up to 10 years in prison. They were charged under a law
approved by Congress in 1996 that makes it a federal crime to steal
pieces of a civil aircraft involved in a crash. Stacey, under his
plea agreement, was charged with theft of government property, a
misdemeanor, and has been promised leniency when sentenced.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Stacey said that as an employee of TWA for 33 years, he had come
to know most of the members of the crew of Flight 800, who were
among the 230 people killed in the crash, and that like Mrs.
Sanders, a flight-attendant supervisor and training instructor, he
was anxious to find the cause of the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   He testified that he took part in the ``conspiracy'' because of
his former friendship with Mrs. Sanders, who was an employee of TWA
for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The parts that I took were dangling down off the seats,''
Stacey said, pointing to the wreckage on display in the middle of
the courtroom. Most of the fabric and cushioning was missing from
the seats, torn away by the explosion and crash. Some of the pieces
were held together by wire and set on a makeshift wood base. Tags
attached to the bent armrests indicated that the seats were from
row 17.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of the wreckage had a chilling effect on the
courtroom and held the gaze of the jurors until Judge Joanna
Seybert asked that the the pieces be taken away.

ARNOLD F. HABIG, 91, BUILDER OF A BILLION-DOLLAR COMPANY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Ind. Ky.)   (rk) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arnold Francis Habig, who built a small Indiana woodworking shop
into Kimball International Inc., died on March 29 at Memorial
Hospital in Jasper, Ind., his birthplace and seat of the
diversified billion-dollar company. He was 91.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in Jasper as the third oldest of 10 children, he held
a variety of odd jobs in his youth, delivering newspapers and baked
goods, cleaning offices, running a movie-theater projector and
working in a Coca-Cola bottling plant. In 1926 he graduated from
Spencerian Business College in Louisville, Ky., and worked briefly
as an accountant there.
</P>
<P>
   Returning home, he went to work at Jasper Machine Works. Then in
1928 he joined the Jasper Wood Products Co. as an accountant and
rose to become plant manager and a director. He stayed until 1950,
when he was elected a director and president of the Midwest
Manufacturing Co.
</P>
<P>
   He also took over as plant manager of that company, which had
some two dozen employees and a 25,000-square-foot production plant.
The company, which changed its name to the Jasper Corp., quickly
grew under his guidance into a leading maker of wood cabinets for
America's top manufacturers of television sets and phonographs.
</P>
<P>
   Sales more than quadrupled to $748,000 in 1950, and it had
profit of $39,000. By comparison, Kimball International _ the name
adopted in 1974 _ posted $1.03 billion in sales and reported net
earnings of $55 million for 1998, with Habig's sons holding top
positions in the company.
</P>
<P>
   In 1950, the Jasper Corp. bought the W.W. Kimball Co. of
Chicago, a venerable but ailing maker of pianos and organs founded
in 1857. As a division of Jasper and then Kimball International it
regained its position as a leading manufacturer of keyboard
instruments, and in 1966 acquired Boesendorfer of Vienna, often
called the Rolls-Royce of concert grands.
</P>
<P>
   At plants in eight states and four more abroad, Kimball's more
than 9,000 employees manufactured a wide variety of consumer
durables under its family of brand names, including furniture and
audio speaker systems, as well as veneer, plywood and wood
components.
</P>
<P>
   Habig introduced a profit-sharing system to provide nest eggs
for company employees and scholarship programs for their children.
He was active in community affairs and supported various charities,
particularly in the arts and education.
</P>
<P>
   He led the company as president and then chairman from 1950
until 1990, when he formally retired from Kimball's board. But he
remained active in the company, most recently in a consulting role
with the title of assistant to the chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Habig's first wife, Mary Ann Jahn Habig, died in 1972. They had
been married for 44 years. That year he married Barbara T.
Cukierski, who survives. Other survivors are three sons and three
daughters from his first marriage: Thomas L., Douglas A., and John
B., all of Jasper, and the vice chairman, chairman and chief
executive, and senior vice president for electronics operations,
respectively; Nancy Habig, also of Jasper; Barbara Jane Habig of
Bloomington, Ind., and Marilyn Schultheis of Evansville, Ind.;
three brothers, Anthony and Jerome, of Jasper, and Francis, of High
Point, N.C.; 12 grandchildren, and 17 great-grandchildren.

 Concealed-weapons issue ran into impenetrable opposition in urban
areas  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIT WAGAR  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Supporters of concealed handguns in Missouri
can blame their loss in Tuesday's election on surprisingly vigorous
opposition from urban voters and weaker-than-expected support in
several key rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri voters defeated Proposition B by about 44,000 votes, or
52 percent to 48 percent, thanks largely to an outpouring of
anti-gun votes in St. Louis County. Proposition B would have
allowed Missouri residents to carry concealed firearms for the
first time since Jesse James terrorized the state. And, like James,
the proposition was more popular in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   But the proposition's rural support wasn't strong enough to
offset anti-gun sentiment in the state's two largest metropolitan
areas.
</P>
<P>
   Rural areas make up about 62 percent of Missouri's population.
Voters there favored concealed guns 60 percent to 40 percent. But
voters in Kansas City and St. Louis opposed the measure by an even
larger margin: 65 percent to 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Weaker-than-expected support in the Springfield area and
northwestern Missouri also played important roles in the measure's
defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Gun advocates had hoped for low voter turnout, in the belief
that concealed-weapons supporters would dominate the polls during
an April election with no other major statewide issue on the
ballot.
</P>
<P>
   However, the emotions generated by the gun-rights debate sparked
a record April turnout of 1.3 million voters. Secretary of State
Rebecca Cook had predicted a turnout of 900,000, or about 25
percent of registered voters.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis County, where 70 percent of voters opposed concealed
guns, provided two of every nine votes cast in the election and
nearly one of every three votes against Proposition B. Within the
St. Louis city limits, 74 percent voted no.
</P>
<P>
   Within the Kansas City limits, 72 percent opposed the
proposition. Jackson County, overall, voted concealed weapons down
61 to 39 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Myers, campaign manager for Missourians Against Crime, said
Tuesday he expected the rural vote to make up for a poor showing in
the cities.
</P>
<P>
   But Bob Hodgdon, a board member of the National Rifle
Association from Overland Park, Kan., said he was surprised by how
badly the vote turned out in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know headquarters was worried about St. Louis from the
start,'' Hodgdon said. ``I thought it would lose by much less.''
</P>
<P>
   But even in some rural areas, support was mixed. In the 19
counties of northwestern Missouri, 48.2 percent of the voters
opposed concealed handguns. In Buchanan County, where St. Joseph is
the biggest city, 57 percent voted against it.
</P>
<P>
   Hodgdon attributed the weak showing in northwestern Missouri to
the influence of the Kansas City media, which editorialized against
concealed guns.
</P>
<P>
   In Greene County, dominated by Springfield, gun advocates had
hoped for a big win. Even pro-gun radio ads by John Ashcroft, the
Republican U.S. senator from Springfield, didn't generate
widespread support.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal passed by fewer than 3,000 votes in Greene County,
with 47 percent voting against it.
</P>
<P>
   Gun-control advocates couldn't keep from gloating over Missouri
voters' rejection of concealed weapons, despite the NRA's spending
nearly $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got to be a good day when you win after being outspent
5-1,'' said Brian Morton, a spokesman for Handgun Control Inc. in
Washington. ``No matter how much money they spent, Missouri voters
could see through the extremist positions of the NRA.''
</P>
<P>
   The NRA, which had earlier called the election a showdown over
Second Amendment rights, on Wednesday downplayed the significance
of the vote. The group blamed Democratic Gov. Mel Carnahan for the
outcome and criticized him for meddling in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did everything he could do to defeat this measure,'' NRA
spokesman Bill Powers said. ``This crosses the line to where it
becomes a mistrust of the people of the state.''
</P>
<P>
   That comment perplexed many anti-gun workers, some of whom had
privately criticized Carnahan for not having actively opposed
concealed weapons. Carnahan, who had threatened to veto
concealed-weapons legislation for years, kept a low profile on the
issue after the legislature passed a bill submitting it to a public
vote.
</P>
<P>
   Many observers thought he was trying to downplay his opposition,
to avoid offending rural voters in next year's campaign for U.S.
Senate against Ashcroft.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan spokesman Chris Sifford found the NRA criticism
somewhat confusing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It obviously doesn't make a lot of sense for an organization
in Fairfax, Va., to criticize the governor for being involved in a
public policy issue in Missouri,'' he said. ``This is a group that
pumped millions of dollars into a Missouri campaign from out of
state.''
</P>
<P>
   Hodgdon said the NRA originally planned to spend $3.5 million on
the Missouri election. The group pumped in at least another
$250,000 as the campaign went down to the wire.
</P>
<P>
   Hodgdon tried to put a good face on the outcome. He said the
campaign provided an opportunity to publicize the arguments for
legalizing concealed handguns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well over 600,000 Missourians supported concealed-carry,''
Hodgdon said. ``We came so close to being a majority, and the
people learned so much about it. Before the process started, I
think the public would have been overwhelmingly against us.''
</P>
<P>
   The defeat of the measure to legalize concealed firearms in
Missouri resounded across the state line in Kansas. State Rep.
Candy Ruff of Leavenworth said Wednesday that her bill to allow
concealed weapons in Kansas also will die.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a lot of work to do educating people,'' said Ruff, a
Democrat.

DALLAS MAY HAVE BROKEN SALARY CAP RULES
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The National Football League is investigating accusations that
the Dallas Cowboys violated the league's salary cap rules. The team
could face multimillion-dollar fines and even the temporary loss of
services of the players in question.
</P>
<P>
   The salary cap is considered a vital element that helps maintain
the integrity of the game. Some league executives believe salary
cap violations are almost as damaging to the competitive nature of
pro football as drug use by its players. That is why the league
offers a $1 million reward to anyone with proof that a team is
violating salary cap rules.
</P>
<P>
   Last month it was reported that the Cowboys had reached
multiyear contract agreements, but did not sign center Mark
Stepnoski, wide receiver Raghib Ismail or linebacker Quentin
Coryatt. The Cowboys did not deny the deals had been reached.
</P>
<P>
   Once an agreement has been consummated between a player's agent
and a team, the league urges the team to sign the player to a
contract as soon as possible. After the contract is signed, league
rules stipulate that it must be submitted to the league office
within 24 hours and, subsequently, every team in the league is made
aware of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Several teams said they recently contacted the agents for
Stepnoski, Ismail and Coryatt and were told that each player was no
longer interested in their teams. The teams said they conducted
their own investigation and determined that some sort of
arrangement had been reached between the Cowboys and three players.
</P>
<P>
   At that point at least several teams complained to the league
office. Those teams told the NFL they believed the Cowboys had
reached a verbal or written agreement with the three players, but
had not signed them to a contract to circumvent cap rules.
</P>
<P>
   At least two teams believe the Cowboys, about $255,000 under the
$59 million salary cap, may have hidden a deal with the three
players because they did not have the room to sign them, but wanted
to make sure other teams did not sign them.
</P>
<P>
   The league, prompted by the complaints, began to explore the
situation themselves, according to team executives, union officials
and agents.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL confirmed they are looking into the matter but had no
further comment.
</P>
<P>
   The league is examining whether the Cowboys made two separate
violations, officials said. First, not reporting a contractual
agreement within 24 hours and second, circumventing the salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   Initial offenses for either violation usually incur a warning
from the league. It is not known if Dallas has previously been
warned. Or, if the league feels the violations are serious enough,
Commissioner Paul Tagliabue could fine the Cowboys as much as $2
million or even temporarily revoke any contract Ismail, Stepnoski
and Coryatt may have agreed to.
</P>
<P>
   There is currently no proof the Cowboys have broken any rules. A
team spokesman said the Cowboys have been contacted by league
officials regarding Coryatt, but the league was satisfied with the
teams' explanation about his presence at the Cowboys training
facility even though he was not signed. (Coryatt was visiting a
friend on the team.) They have not been contacted about the other
two players, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The players have not agreed to terms or signed any contracts
and, therefore, could not have violated any rules, the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Cowboys are guilty, it is almost impossible to
police many of the salary cap rules. It is too easy to cheat and
too hard to prove.
</P>
<P>
   Still, team and league executives said they believe there is
anecdotal evidence the Cowboys do have an agreement and are indeed
breaking the rules. They point to the fact Ismail and Coryatt have
recently been house-hunting in Dallas and that all three players
stopped listening to inquiries from other teams.
</P>
<P>
   What also caused the ire of at least two teams was that they
were interested in a Dallas restricted free agent they would not
identify. The Cowboys have the right of first refusal and can match
any offer made to one of their restricted free agents.
</P>
<P>
   The two teams believe the Cowboys would be near or over the
salary cap if the three contracts were signed, thus, Dallas would
not be able to match an offer made to the restricted player.
</P>
<P>
   The three players could be important for Dallas this coming
season. Stepnoski is a former Pro Bowl player, Ismail would add
speed to the team's receiving corps and Coryatt is a former
first-round pick with the Indianapolis Colts.

PLEA OF NOT GUILTY ENTERED TO CHARGES IN ONE OF 5 HOMICIDES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRISTINE VENDEL and LYNN FRANEY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The man suspected in the killings of five men
pleaded not guilty Wednesday in one of the homicides amid tight
security after police received several death threats against him.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors charged Gary Beach this week with first-degree
murder and armed criminal action in the death of Kenneth Gulley,
45, of Independence. Gulley's body was one of five found Monday in
Beach's rental house at 4275 Jefferson St. Police released the
identity of the fifth victim Wednesday: Jeral B. Nickerson, 61, of
Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have said Beach, 56, is the only person suspected in
the homicides.
</P>
<P>
   Beach was arrested Tuesday morning a few blocks from his house.
He was questioned by police and placed in the city jail to await
arraignment.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives escorted Beach from the jail to the Jackson County
Courthouse on Wednesday morning, but deviated from the usual
routine because of the threats. Police said several persons called
a tips hotline overnight, claiming they planned to kill Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives escorted Beach to an unmarked police vehicle with
darkened windows and loaded him into the vehicle in an area not
readily accessible to the public. They left police headquarters
earlier than normal and drove Beach past waiting reporters and
photographers.
</P>
<P>
   Prisoners are usually escorted past photographers in an open
garage area and loaded into a van.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the multiple threats, we didn't want to take any
chances,'' said Detective Al DeValkenaere, who drove Beach to his
court appearance.
</P>
<P>
   DeValkenaere said Beach said nothing during the brief trip.
</P>
<P>
   At the courthouse, a hostile spectator whispered an expletive to
Beach as he walked by.
</P>
<P>
   Beach entered his plea of not guilty and was taken to the
Jackson County Jail, where he is being held without bond.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they were still trying to determine whether each
victim had been shot with the same weapon. Court records showed
Gulley died from a gunshot wound to the face and police initially
said it appeared each victim died from gunshot wounds.
</P>
<P>
   A gun was recovered from Beach's car when he was arrested, but
police have not said whether it is thought to be the murder weapon.
Relatives said Beach traded two handguns to his brother for a 9mm
pistol two weeks ago. Police searching Beach's house found 9mm
cartridge casings near the bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities don't think all five victims were killed at the same
time, but they declined to reveal when each victim died or in what
order. Besides Gulley and Nickerson, the other victims were
Christopher Conrad, 27, of Overland Park; Mark Nelson, 28, of
Kansas City; and Mike L. Davis, 32, of Kansas City. Nelson and
Davis lived with Beach and Nickerson had lived with Beach in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   Police met with the victims' family members Wednesday night to
brief them on the progress of the homicide investigation. Family
members declined to comment afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and neighbors said Nickerson, the last victim
identified, was a quiet, private man who caused no one harm.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was strait-laced,'' said Ken Ruhnke, who lived across the
street from Nickerson in the 3600 block of Jefferson Street. ``He
went to work every day. He was like clockwork. Very routine.''
</P>
<P>
   Nickerson drove for a limo service for years, working closely
with fellow limo driver Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Nickerson was a close friend of Beach. For years, waitresses
served them meals almost every day at Nichols Lunch, a 24-hour
restaurant at 39th Street and Southwest Trafficway. Waitresses said
they usually ate with Davis, who was Beach's stepson and who lived
with Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Nickerson had moved a couple of weeks ago from his rental home
to an apartment at Roanoke Parkway and Jarboe Street, friends said.
</P>
<P>
   New owners had bought the well-kept two-story house on Jefferson
he had rented for more than a decade, and didn't want to rent it
out.
</P>
<P>
   So he was forced to move, which he was upset about, neighbors
said.
</P>
<P>
   Friends said Nickerson was diabetic and had a regular lunch he
loved _ ``cheeseburger, hold the fries, salad with diet dressing.''
</P>
<P>
   He was always nicely dressed and treated people kindly.
</P>
<P>
   Ruhnke said Nickerson had few visitors to his home.
</P>
<P>
   In another development Wednesday, police determined a stolen car
that was left with its engine running on the street next to Beach's
house last week was not related to the homicides.

1,000 DELOITTE CONSULTANTS LEAVE FIRM TO FORM COMPANY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (rk) 
 By MELODY PETERSEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Big Five accounting firms may be too successful at what was
once a secondary business: consulting.
</P>
<P>
   Deloitte &AMP; Touche, a unit of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, is
expected to announce Thursday that a group of about 1,000 of its
consultants, who provide companies with temporary, experienced
accountants, will leave the firm and create their own company.
</P>
<P>
   The consultants said they have had to turn down an increasing
number of proposals because they involved providing accountants and
financial managers to companies that Deloitte &AMP; Touche audited.
</P>
<P>
   Federal securities regulators have raised concerns about similar
arrangements in the past because they could be creating conflicts
of interest for auditors.
</P>
<P>
   Auditors must be independent because their job is to review the
financial statements companies have prepared. Conflicts can arise
when an accounting firm's consultants are helping to prepare those
financial statements since the auditors could be seen as reviewing
their own work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were getting more and more requests from Deloitte &AMP; Touche
audit clients that we could not do because of independence
concerns,'' said Donald B. Murray, who helped create what has
quickly grown into a $100 million consulting business for Deloitte.
``It was becoming more and more of an issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The consultants would not disclose how much they paid Deloitte &AMP;
Touche to leave. Their new company, Resources Connection, is based
in Santa Ana, Calif. The private transaction closed on April 1.
</P>
<P>
   All of the nation's five largest accounting firms have
consulting practices where they supply accountants to companies on
a contract basis. In some cases, the accounting firms agree to take
over the company's entire accounting and finance department in what
is referred to as outsourcing arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, companies worldwide spent more than $7 billion to
outsource their accounting and finance departments, said Eric
Blantz, an analyst at Dataquest, a consulting firm in Lowell, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Five accounting firms, he said, are among the top 10
providers of the outsourcing of accounting work, which includes
activities such as billing customers and providing internal
auditors.
</P>
<P>
   Ernst &AMP; Young, for example, has a joint venture with Shell
International, a unit of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group. The venture,
called Tasco Europe, performs the accounting work for Shell's
businesses and also offers its services to companies across Europe.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Murray said many of the accountants who work for Re:sources
Connection were once auditors at Deloitte or at other Big Five
firms. Many of the accountants also have held top accounting and
finance jobs at companies.
</P>
<P>
   At Deloitte, and now at Re:sources Connection, the
accountants-turned-consultants are hired by companies that need
accounting experts to manage a complicated job like combining the
company's accounting records with those of another company that has
just been acquired.
</P>
<P>
   In December, another group of consultants left Deloitte &AMP;
Touche. Those consultants, who helped form a new company called EPS
Solutions, also offer outsourcing services.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think some of the things they had wanted to do at Deloitte,
they couldn't do because of independence concerns,'' Murray said.
</P>
<P>
   Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu said its global consulting revenues had
grown at a rate of 40 percent last year to $3.24 billion.

CHARGES DROPPED FOR DEMONSTRATORS WHO PROTESTED DIALLO SHOOTING
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By PAUL ZIELBAUER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A Manhattan Criminal Court judge dismissed disorderly
conduct and other charges Wednesday against the 1,166 demonstrators
arrested during last month's wave of daily protests over the police
shooting of Amadou Diallo.
</P>
<P>
   After the court session, defense lawyers welcomed the
dismissals, which came as no surprise, because the Manhattan
district attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau, announced last week that
he was likely to ask a judge to throw out the charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``The demonstrations at Police Plaza have set a new national
standard as a way of making people take notice of a critical issue
that confronts us,'' said Michael A. Hardy, one of four lawyers who
addressed a bank of television cameras and reporters on a sidewalk
outside the court building Wednesday. ``That is the issue of the
relationship between law enforcement and the minority communities
all across this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Police Commissioner Howard Safir said that he was
against automatic dismissal of the charges, a view he reiterated
Wednesday. ``The courts should have adjudicated this,'' Safir said.
``I have a lot of respect for District Attorney Morgenthau. He and
I usually agree. This time we disagree.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said on Saturday that he could see both
sides of the disagreement, but a spokeswoman said Wednesday that
Giuliani supported the judge's decision. ``The protesters'
detention, which in some instances was for up to 10 hours, is
equivalent to a form of punishment,'' said the spokeswoman, Sunny
Mindel.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the 1,166 people, including a handful of politicians and
celebrities, blocked the entrance to 1 Police Plaza and certain
Wall Street buildings during three weeks of peaceful but systematic
protests last month. The demonstrations ended March 29, two days
before the four white police officers who fatally shot Diallo, an
immigrant peddler, on Feb. 4 were arraigned on second-degree murder
charges.

STARWOOD STOCK ADVANCES 3 PERCENT ON UPGRADE BY MERRILL LYNCH
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Nev., N.J.)   (nk) 
 By EDWIN McDOWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The shares of Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide Inc. rose
$1.1875, or 3 percent, Wednesday to $31.25, after Merrill Lynch
upgraded its rating on the company's stock.
</P>
<P>
   Also adding to the increase in Starwood shares was the belief
among some institutional investors, who attended a luncheon on
Tuesday at which the featured speaker was Barry S. Sternlicht,
Starwood's chairman, that Sternlicht intended to sell the Caesars
hotels and casinos.
</P>
<P>
   Several people close to the company said that Sternlicht was in
discussions with Arthur M. Goldberg, chairman of the Park Place
Entertainment Corp., about the possible sale of Caesars. But the
people did not know the sale price or asking price for Caesars,
perhaps the best-known name in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Park Place, the newly formed gambling company resulting from
Hilton Hotel's spinoff of its gambling business and Park Place's
merger with the Mississippi gambling operations of Grand Casinos
Inc., is the world's biggest gambling company.
</P>
<P>
   A Starwood spokesman, Jim Gallagher, declined Wednesday night to
comment on those talks. But speaking generally, he said, ``Starwood
has often said that with the creation of shareholder value as its
goal, everything we own is for sale at the right price.'' That
includes its Desert Inn property in Las Vegas, which has been on
the block for some time.
</P>
<P>
   Jason N. Ader, a lodging analyst at Bear, Stearns, has valued
Caesars at about $3 billion. In an assessment of Sternlicht's
remarks at the luncheon, he said that another possibility could be
a spin out of gambling to shareholders like Hilton. ``In the Hilton
spinoff,'' Ader said, ``we quickly saw the value of the two
separate parts exceed the prespin-out value of the combined
company.''
</P>
<P>
   Starwood has also been in talks about the possibility of buying
the Prime Hospitality Corp. of Fairfield, N.J., a hotel owner and
management company with some 160 properties in 30 states and the
Caribbean. Gallagher also declined to comment on that matter.
</P>
<P>
   Sternlicht has publicly expressed disappointment with the
company's gambling results from last year, as industry margins were
affected by increased competition and, in Las Vegas especially, a
downturn in the number of high-rollers from Asia. But after
Starwood acquired Sheraton in February 1998, Sternlicht said he
would take about 18 months to learn the gambling business better
before making any important decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Ader, the host of Tuesday's luncheon in Manhattan at Starwood's
new hotel, said that Sternlicht implied that ``he has concluded
that two businesses should eventually separate,'' and that he
seemed troubled by the earnings volatility that comes from Caesars
heavy reliance on baccarat and that sector's limited growth
prospects.
</P>
<P>
   But others in attendance drew a different conclusion. One
person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that
Sternlicht's lamentations about the volatility of baccarat appeared
to reinforce the probability of Starwood's selling Caesars.

Big hitters still own Masters edge
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By EDDIE SEFKO &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
AUGUSTA, Ga. _ There have been so many changes at Augusta National
Golf Club this year, such as the inch-long fuzzy rough that can
play havoc with shots aimed from it to those treacherous greens.
</P>
<P>
   Also new is the added length on two par-5s and pine trees
between Nos. 15 and 17 that popped up like a Chia forest to provide
previously forgiving spaces a bit more bite.
</P>
<P>
   Threesomes teeing off this morning for only the second time in
Masters history. No Jack Nicklaus. Both rare oddities.
</P>
<P>
   The next thing you know, there's going to be a windmill on the
11th green that will gobble up golf balls and spit them back out up
the fairway. Or, at the very least, tennis courts.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the alterations at one of golf's most
history-conscious sites, some things never change.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, a segment of an interview with Masters tournament
chairman Hootie Johnson on Wednesday yielded this exchange:
</P>
<P>
   Question: Would you mind telling us how many African-American
and how many female members there are at Augusta National?
</P>
<P>
   Johnson: ``Well, that's a club matter, ma'am, and all club
matters are private.''
</P>
<P>
   Question: Are there female members?
</P>
<P>
   Johnson: ``That's a club matter and all club matters are
private, ma'am.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, we'll take that as a ``no.''
</P>
<P>
   Some traditions stand tall amid the dogwoods and azaleas.
</P>
<P>
   Another one that survives the attempts to bring it down is the
fact that the big-knockers still have the best chance of winning
the Masters when tournament play opens this morning.
</P>
<P>
   Taking out bunkers along the par-5 15th means shorter, more
accurate drivers can't use the mounds to get extra distance.
Similarly, the additional 20 yards on No. 2 means only the longest
hitters will be able to get on or handy to the green in two shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the changes are beneficial to all the long hitters, no
doubt about it,'' Tiger Woods said. ``Some of the short hitters
could use the mounds on No. 15 and they aren't there now. They'll
be hitting 3-woods or long irons into that green. No. 17 is a huge
advantage for a long hitter. I don't even think about that
Eisenhower Tree, and the shorter hitters have to go around it.
That's a tough shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods joins David Duval as the heavy favorites to win the 63rd
Masters. Whether their rivalry blossoms this week like the redbuds
surrounding the 16th hole depends much on whether either or both of
them can make a run at the green jacket come Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   And the new Augusta plays right into the hands of both players,
along with Ernie Els, John Huston, Greg Norman and others who can
put the ball into orbit _ or at least beyond Ike's Tree on the
newly conformed 17th hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming here, having length is a good deal,'' Fred Couples
said. ``I've done well and finished seventh or 10th or whatever
here just because I hit the ball a long way.''
</P>
<P>
   While nobody's certain what to expect out of the new Augusta,
the guess is that scores will rise slightly, mainly because the
changes won't really change the course for long hitters, but will
penalize short-knockers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish they hadn't had to make the changes simply because of
(the evolution) of equipment,'' said Nicklaus, who will be missing
his first Masters in 41 years because he has not fully recovered
from hip-replacement surgery. ``But I think that the changes that
have been made are quite good.
</P>
<P>
   ``The changes are going to add a stroke, probably two strokes to
the field. I think No. 2 will play half a stroke harder per round
and I think No. 17 will play half a stroke harder per round. So I
think the course is probably one stroke tougher per round.
</P>
<P>
   ``But as good as these guys are, if they get the right
conditions, they'll still shoot low scores.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Couples: ``In my opinion, I think scores will go up. But I
would say there are only so many guys who have a real chance at
winning. My four or five would start with David Duval. I think
Vijay Singh is going to be up there. I'll go with Tiger Woods and
Ernie Els.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked where he would fit in the ratings, Couples said: ``I'm No.
1. I never predict myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval, of course, is going for his third victory in a row,
having already collected winner's checks at the Players
Championship and BellSouth Classic over the past two weekends.
</P>
<P>
   Duval has no real worries coming into the the tournament. He
dismissed any speculation that, after winning the last two events
on Tour, he might be lacking enough fuel in the tank to stay
mentally in gear for the year's first major championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't have to rely on adrenalin here,'' Duval said. ``If you
can't get worked up and ready to play here, you need to do
something else.''
</P>
<P>
   One person who isn't worked up is defending champion Mark
O'Meara. He could spend the rest of his career basking in the
memory of sinking that 20-foot putt on No. 18 to win last year's
Masters and nobody would blame him. His birdie-par-birdie-birdie
finish last year catapulted him to a dream year. He won the British
Open in addition to the Masters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just trying to enjoy this week,'' O'Meara said, but
quickly added he didn't want people to get the wrong impression
about his focus. ``I'm prepared. I feel like I'm playing better now
than I was last year coming in. With golf, anything can happen. But
I definitely want to enjoy the week.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether everybody enjoys all the newness at venerable Augusta is
another subject. But regardless of whether the changes favor long
hitters, the movers and shakers at Augusta are pleased with the
results of the face lift.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we hope to do is keep up with golf and the game of
today,'' Johnson said. ``The guys are hitting it longer and they're
in better condition and the equipment is better. We're attempting
to strengthen the golf course to stay in tune with the times.''
</P>
<P>
   In that respect, Augusta is trying to keep up with progress in
the game of golf.
</P>
<P>
   Now, about those female members

Duval is latest in can't-miss line
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By FRAN BLINEBURY &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ Along with all of the other changes at Augusta
National this year _ the new trees planted along the right side of
the No. 15 fairway, the extra yardage added to the tee shots on
Nos. 2 and 17, the 1]-inch rough around the course _ you stroll
down Magnolia Lane and almost expect to see David Duval's profile
painted on the roof of the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   After all, this is the Duval Open. Or so we are led to believe
by the covers of all the hype machines.
</P>
<P>
   Sports Illustrated: ``David Duval is on fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Golf World: ``Can David slay Goliath?''
</P>
<P>
   Golfweek: ``Duval! Four!''
</P>
<P>
   And the numbers shout just as loud. The ones that tell us that
while spring is barely two weeks old, Duval has already won four
tournaments on the PGA Tour this year and is ranked No. 1 on both
the money list and in the computer rankings of the world's best
players.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes according to form this weekend, Duval will blitz
straight down the middle of the fairways with his laser-straight
drives, have them singing hosannas in Amen Corner with his feathery
putting touch, slip into the green jacket early Sunday evening and
then hop aboard a military transport plane that will carry him to
Kosovo, where he'll take care of the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, maybe another golfer will step into Duval's path and
detour the victory parade.
</P>
<P>
   ``David Duval is playing better,'' Tiger Woods said. ``We'll
see.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, premature coronations have a way of making the would-be
kings left to feel like jokers. What Duval is right now is Duke on
the eve of the NCAA basketball tournament. All that's left to do is
actually win the thing. The Blue Devils were the hottest things
since the invention of the wheel until Connecticut came along to
play the role of the nail that punctured their tire.
</P>
<P>
   It is the nature of this sports business. There is always going
to be another version of the biggest and baddest on the block, the
unbeatable monster. That is, until somebody comes along to beat it.
</P>
<P>
   Just two years ago, Woods strode onto Augusta National and
brought the hallowed course to its knees, shooting a Masters'
record 270 and winning by another record 12 shots over Tom Kite.
That performance, to hear all of the descriptions and read the
analyses, effectively ended competitive golf as we know it straight
through the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
   The aftermath brought word that golf courses would have to be
``Tiger-proofed'' in order to maintain a competitive balance in the
game.
</P>
<P>
   The afternmath from April of 1997 also brought this: four tour
wins by Woods and 11 by Duval, who is now either the next great
thing or the latest flavor of the month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it would be a disappointment if I didn't win,''
Duval said. ``I'd consider it a disappointment if I didn't
contend.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see,'' said Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Duval had a chance a year ago until Mark O'Meara sank a 20-foot
putt on the last hole to win by a stroke. Now he returns as the
smokingest gun to draw on Augusta National since Arnold Palmer in
1960 and Johnny Miller in 1974 both entered the Masters with four
tour victories already in their pockets.
</P>
<P>
   Not that golf needs much more to make it a sizzling sport
entering the 21st century. But a Woods-Duval rivalry could send it
into orbit.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, it could be the first of its kind. For while Sam
Snead, Ben Hogan and Byron Nelson were all born in the same year,
1912, there were real-life intrusions _ World War II, a devastating
injury to Hogan and the early retirement of Nelson _ that cut down
what could have been a glorious rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer was 10 years older than Jack Nicklaus when the Golden
Bear began to roar, Nicklaus had a decade on Tom Watson and, by the
time Nick Faldo and Greg Norman started warring, both golfers were
already in their mid-to-late 30s.
</P>
<P>
   Now we have Duval, 27, and Woods, 23, sitting in the top two
positions in the computer rankings, a pair of aces from the same
generation, familiar with the same slang and the same popular
music, maybe ready to square off for years and years to come.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger is the flamboyant one, known for wearing red and showing
his emotions on the course. Duval is the controlled one, never
changing his expression and his favorite Sunday outfit is a cool
blue.
</P>
<P>
   Duval wears his trademark Oakley sunglasses. Woods wears his
trademark megawatt smile. Duval has those 11 wins overall. But
Woods has a win in a major.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at the two of them and it really is what it's all
about,'' Norman said.
</P>
<P>
   That and living up to the hype.

Their condo associations and social clubs were just like the
meeting halls and church basements back home, and they became a
steady, swelling political force, and they voted for Democrats. But
now the New Deal Democrats are being replaced by immigrants from
Latin America, the Caribbean, Canada, Europe, as well as American

they are less likely than others to have children, and those who do

birth defect as the mother. However, most give birth to healthy
children, and their children are not at increased risk for any type
of defect except the mother's. The study, based on birth

News, someone posted a fake news story that said an American
technology company called PairGain Technologies Inc. was being
taken over by an Israeli rival. The report spread to a Yahoo

   KOSOVO-LOGO (Undated) _ Even wars have logos these days, at
least on television, and the coverage of the Kosovo war invariably
features the Albanian eagle, splashed across the screen like the
NBC peacock. The Albanian eagle, angular, Gothic, almost medieval
in style, with its two heads and dragonlike claws, seems to sum up
the ancient nature of the conflicts in the Balkans _ and the fears
Americans have of an area they don't understand. It's a feathered
version of all the fears of foreign entanglements we've worried
about since Washington's Farewell address. By Phil Patton.
</P>
<P>
   MOTORCOACH-RESORT (Undated) _ A few miles, as the pelican flies,
from the warm green waters of the Gulf of Mexico, tan bodies
gathered round a patio table. The conversation paused when an
engine rumble neared. A new neighbor was moving onto Southern
Breeze Drive. ``Nice,'' Kraig Brechbuhler said as the newest home
on the block rolled by, its burgundy-and-gold sides sparkling in
the noon sun. In the gated community known as Pelican Lake
Motorcoach Resort, not only do the neighbors come and go, but so
also do the homes. No Winnebagos here, however. This resort is
exclusively for luxury motor coaches, most of them longer than 37
feet. They look like tour buses for rock stars. By Diane Ketcham.

COLLECTIONS OF OF MUSIC FOR THE SPIRIT
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   The first piece of music some children are likely to hear is not
a popular tune or even a lullaby, but a hymn. A mother's favorite,
or the choir's rendition at a family christening or wedding or
funeral, can conquer time and elevate the soul.
</P>
<P>
   ``Onward, Christian Soldiers'' is a common favorite, especially
for people who grew up before some denominations decided that it
sounded hostile and pulled it from their hymnals. Perhaps a fan
would like to hear it again or know more about it _ author, date,
background. That presents a problem. No matter that many people
find hymns to be the most moving form of music; they're not going
to encounter them on the top 40 during drive time. Religious radio
stations do their part, but their air time is limited.
</P>
<P>
   Well, here's a tip: the Cyber Hymnal, at tch.simplenet.com.
``Are you choosing hymns for a worship service, but don't know what
they sound like? Now you can find out,'' it announces with a
revival preacher's enthusiasm. The free site has more than 1,600
Christian hymns and gospel songs from many denominations. It
includes lyrics, background information, photos, links, MIDI sound
files and scores for downloading.
</P>
<P>
   ``Onward, Christian Soldiers'' is listed by title, with the
following information. ``Words: Sabine Baring-Gould, 1864.
Baring-Gould wrote this hymn for a procession of children marching
between two villages in his parish on Whitsunday (he later said he
dashed off the lyrics in under 10 minutes).'' The composer was Sir
Arthur Sullivan (1871), and the music is ``St. Gertrude.'' There
are pictures of both men and a MIDI file for the tune. There are
indexes by title, author or composer (20 hymns by Sullivan are
provided) and tune (two other hymns also use ``St. Gertrude).''
</P>
<P>
   Don't have a favorite hymn? The Cyber Hymnal will surf for you,
playing one after another at random. Perhaps its most entertaining
page is Hymn Trivia. By far the most popular hymn, based on Web
traffic, is ``Amazing Grace.'' The tune most often used in hymns is
``Duke Street.'' The most prolific author is probably Frances Jane
(Fanny) Crosby (1820-1915), who the site says wrote more than 8,000
hymns, the last one the day before she died at age 95. The site
also lists 10 hymns (including ``Onward, Christian Soldiers'') that
were heard in movies that won or were nominated for Academy Awards.
</P>
<P>
   There are many other hymn sites on line. A beautiful one is
Traditional Catholic MIDI files
(www.homestead.com/midicatholic/Catholicinformation.html), by Don
Wyckoff. The Eastern Catholic Liturgical Music site
(www.homestead.com/Easterncatholichymns/SpasiHospodi.html) offers
hymns and other music from the Byzantine, Ukrainian, Armenian,
Maronite and other Eastern rites. The Christian Classics Ethereal
Library at Wheaton College (ccel.wheaton.edu/(NU)Hymns) has the
words to the Protestant Episcopal Hymnal of 1916, John Wesley's
``Collection of Hymns, for the Use of the People Called
Methodists,'' other collections and 200 sound files.
</P>
<P>
   Enthusiasm is everything in a hymn. Hymn sites are as apt to be
created by devout individuals as by religious organizations or
colleges.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to hear the old hymns I sang as a child,'' Brian M.
Ames wrote by e-mail about the Ames Hymn Collection
(junior.apk.net/bmames/hymnsjs.htm). Ames' site begins with ``The
Woods,'' which he wrote in memory of his father, Jay Walter Ames,
who died Feb. 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I enjoy most about my hymn site is when I see it bring
comfort to the suffering,'' Ames wrote via e-mail. ``I have made a
point to overlook differences, welcoming the use of my hymns by
those of various views and life styles.
</P>
<P>
   ``One site, operated by a Baptist fundamentalist, has a link to
my site not too far from links to pages describing the evils of the
Roman Catholic Church, of which I am an adherent. Another site,
operated as a ministry to gays and lesbians, was so expectant of
rejection in their request to use my music that it nearly broke my
heart. At yet another site, several of my hymns have been used to
create a touching memorial to a deceased mother. To me, this is
what hymns on the Web should do.''

Rockets remember Spurs
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By MICHAEL MURPHY &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
Leave it to Charles Barkley to take the first verbal swing in the
ongoing feud between the Rockets and San Antonio Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs return to Compaq Center tonight for the first time
since they beat the Rockets by 17 points March 2, and Barkley
believes there is a score to settle between the Midwest Division
rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Spurs have a good team, but we owe them a game,
actually,'' Barkley said. ``They came here and spanked us pretty
good. That was actually pretty much our wakeup call for the season.
They humiliated us last time here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their goals are a little bit different than ours. They just
want to play well _ we want to win championships. Yeah, their goals
are different than ours.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs might argue that point _ they are the league's hottest
team, winning 17 of their last 19 games. The streak has moved the
Spurs up to the No. 3 seed in the Western Conference playoff
picture, just ahead of you know who.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rockets are itching for a chance to exact a little
revenge, especially when they look back on that 99-82 loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely,'' said Hakeem Olajuwon. ``We lost to them in that
last game here and I don't think we want to form that kind of
habit, for them to think that they can come in here and win. We
have to change that.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially considering the schedule over the next couple of
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets play San Antonio tonight at Compaq Center and then
hit the road for Sunday's game at Utah. Then it's on to Minnesota
to play the Timberwolves on Monday, then home games against
Vancouver (April 14) and Portland (April 15).
</P>
<P>
   ``We're starting to play much better teams right now,'' Scottie
Pippen said. ``We're looking at San Antonio, then we have to go
into Utah and then we have Minnesota (on the road). It's going to
get a little hectic for us, but it's that time of the season when
we have to start playing against some stiffer competition so we can
start to figure out where we are as a team and if we're really
getting better.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs will be a pretty good measuring stick.
</P>
<P>
   With 7-0 Tim Duncan and 7-1 David Robinson up front, the Spurs
have enough size to bother an inside-oriented team like the
Rockets. Add the fact that the teams are fierce rivals, a facet
that got a bit spicier when the Spurs picked up former Rocket Mario
Elie during the offseason, and you have the necessary ingredients
for a big game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always a rivalry because of the matchups,'' Olajuwon
said. ``It's balanced because you have great big men on that team
and we play the same style of basketball. Our strengths are their
strengths, so it's always a battle against them.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is exactly what Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich expects.
With the playoffs less than a month away, Tomjanovich is looking
for a little playoff-type intensity when the teams hit the floor
tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a good team, and they were struggling when we played
them earlier in the season,'' Tomjanovich said. ``But they've got a
tremendous run going here. They have two of the best big men in the
game and they have a lot of competitors on that team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to be a playoff-intensity type (of game).
And we need that. We have only 16 games left so it's going to be
good for not only our rookies but even our veterans.''
</P>
<P>
   A big plus with the season winding down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 10 (games) at home and six on the road,'' Tomjanovich
said. ``We do have some tough opponents, but that should also be a
positive to get us in a playoff-type mentality going down the
stretch. And there are going to be some big challenges, because
we're going to go against teams we're in the (playoff) race with.''
</P>
<P>
   Which has been one of the knocks against the Rockets this season
_ their record against upper-echelon teams.
</P>
<P>
   Against the other top seven teams in the West (Utah, Portland,
San Antonio, Minnesota, Phoenix, Seattle and the Los Angeles
Lakers), the Rockets are 4-8 overall and 0-6 on the road. And the
Rockets lost to three of the top three teams in the East _ at
Miami, at Orlando and at home to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   So getting a good win against a tough opponent like San Antonio
could get the Rockets started off on the right foot in that regard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to beat good teams,'' Tomjanovich said. ``To
get anywhere, you're going to have to do it. To get anywhere in the
playoffs, you're going to have to beat somebody. Hopefully, we'll
have the home-court advantage in the first round, but we don't know
that yet because it's one hell of a race.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had great races at the top, in the middle and down at
the bottom of the playoff seedings, so this is going to be an
exciting last month of the season.''

FORMER IBM OFFICIAL FACES CHARGES IN FRAUD CASE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz., Fla., N.Y.)  (rk) 
 By ANTHONY RAMIREZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A former IBM executive in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., and a Fort
Lauderdale, Fla., man who bought discontinued computer parts were
indicted Wednesday by a federal grand jury on charges that they
were part of a continuing conspiracy to swindle the company out of
at least $20 million worth of surplus computer equipment, including
huge mainframe computers.
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury also charged that outsiders provided company
insiders with more than half a million dollars in cash and other
bribes, including a Florida condominium, to promote the scheme.
</P>
<P>
   As part of its business, IBM contracts with outside companies to
sell or dismantle parts that are used, discontinued or otherwise
deemed to be surplus. Those companies agree to share with IBM any
money from the sale of recycled parts and are forbidden to sell
parts scheduled for scrap.
</P>
<P>
   But a federal jury, sitting in White Plains, charged in a
five-count indictment that Robert St. Germain, 55, who managed
IBM's Reutilization Department in Poughkeepsie, and Lawrence
Laspina, 41, a Fort Lauderdale man who operated at least four
computer parts companies, conspired with others to profit from the
sale of surplus parts.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment alleges that St. Germain conspired to commit tax
fraud and transport fraudulently obtained property across state
lines and that Laspina obstructed justice by destroying or
concealing documents sought by the grand jury. Each of the most
serious charges carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison,
a $250,000 fine, and a penalty of twice the gain from the offense,
as well as restitution.
</P>
<P>
   The office of Mary Jo White, the U.S. attorney for the Southern
District of New York, said, without elaboration, that 11 defendants
in related cases have entered guilty pleas to tax fraud, conspiracy
and other charges.
</P>
<P>
   Herbert Haddad, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney, declined to
say how the scheme was discovered but noted that ``this is still an
open case with a continuing investigation.'' He said that even
though St. Germain left IBM in 1993, he was also indicted in acts
that continued through Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, Wednesday's indictment charges that St. Germain,
while at IBM from 1990 to 1993, negotiated and entered into
contracts with a company called Recycler's Consulting Group Inc.,
or RCG. An ``owner of RCG'' who was identified only as
``Co-conspirator 1'' bribed St. Germain and other employees to sell
surplus computer parts, the indictment states. Laspina joined with
this co-conspirator to bribe St. Germain and others, according to
the indictment.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear why RCG was not indicted. Barbara Guss, the
assistant U.S. attorney handling the case, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas M. Connelly, a Phoenix lawyer representing Laspina, said
that his client did not bribe anyone or obstruct justice. He said
Laspina did buy parts from RCG, but it was RCG that had the
contractual obligations with IBM. ``He is not an officer, director
or principal with RCG,'' Connelly said.
</P>
<P>
   His client, Connelly said, was simply buying parts from
authorized IBM brokers, including RCG.
</P>
<P>
   Peter L. Maroulis, the lawyer for St. Germain, did not return
phone calls seeking comment. Ian Colley, a spokesman for IBM,
declined to comment.

CHINA MAY HAVE STOLEN SECRETS FOR NEUTRON BOMB DURING CLINTON
TERM 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: SUBS 11th graf, The disclosure ..., to ADD reference to
`previously unknown 1996 intelligence' report.) 
 (With CHINA-NUKE-CHRONO) 
(ac) 
 By JEFF GERTH and JAMES RISEN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In early 1996, the United States received a
startling report from one of its Chinese spies. Officials inside
China's intelligence service, the spy said, were boasting that they
had just stolen secrets from the United States and had used them to
improve Beijing's neutron bomb, according to American officials.
</P>
<P>
   The spy had provided reliable information in the past, and
officials said investigators took the report seriously.
</P>
<P>
   China first built and tested a neutron warhead in the 1980s,
using what American officials have said publicly was secret data
stolen from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California,
one of America's key nuclear weapons laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   But the design did not work properly. American officials say
that China's 1988 test of the neutron bomb, which kills people with
enhanced radiation while leaving buildings intact, was not
successful.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the spy was suggesting, Chinese agents had solved the
problem by coming back to the United States in 1995 to steal more
secrets. The spy even provided details of how the information was
transferred from the United States to China, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The report prompted a federal criminal investigation, but
American officials say they have found no evidence that China has
produced an improved neutron bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Berger, who is now the National Security Adviser, was
first told of a possible new theft of neutron bomb data in 1996,
according to officials who took part in the meeting or read the
highly classified materials used to prepare for it.
</P>
<P>
   The briefing, these officials said, came weeks after the FBI
gave the Energy Department a report about the spy's information.
</P>
<P>
   David Leavy, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said
that Berger and another NSC official who attended the 1996 briefing
do not believe the neutron bomb issue was mentioned. Leavy said
that Berger did not learn of the suspicions until a more detailed
briefing in July 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The spy's report arrived as American intelligence agencies were
examining a separate suspected Chinese espionage coup: the theft of
designs of America's most modern nuclear warhead, the W-88.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure of this previously unknown 1996 intelligence
report about the neutron bomb is significant for several reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Clinton administration officials have portrayed
reports of China's nuclear spying as an old story.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of public statements, administration officials have
emphasized that the loss of the W-88 design occurred in the 1980s,
which was while Republicans held the White House. They have
suggested that there is no evidence that Chinese nuclear spying
continued into the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   They have also said that President Clinton acted quickly in
response to concerns about security breaches at the nuclear weapons
laboratories by issuing a presidential order in February 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Accounts by government officials about the neutron bomb case
call both assertions into question.
</P>
<P>
   According to the officials, the April 1996 briefing of Berger
included evidence of the theft of the W-88 design, the need to
increase security at the weapons laboratories and the report about
the loss of neutron bomb data.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said Berger did not tell the president or take
any further action until more than a year later, in July 1997, when
he received a more detailed briefing about the W-88 theft, the
neutron bomb and the ongoing Chinese espionage.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, Leavy said, Berger told the President about the
security weaknesses at the laboratories and China's spying. Asked
whether he mentioned the neutron bomb case, Leavy would reply only
that he did not detail ``each and every allegation.''
</P>
<P>
   A bipartisan Congressional report on China's acquisition of
United States technology includes a detailed, but still secret,
account of Beijing's efforts to obtain neutron bomb secrets,
including reports of efforts during the Clinton Presidency. But
government officials say that the Clinton administration is
resisting requests from Congress to make the more recent material
public.
</P>
<P>
   Leavy said the administration is cooperating with Congress to
declassify as much material as possible consistent with law
enforcement and intelligence requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Several agencies, including the FBI, the Central Intelligence
Agency and the Energy Department are continuing to examine the
case.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI has not identified a suspect in the case.
</P>
<P>
   The April 1996 briefing came at a critical moment in U.S.-China
relations. The Clinton administration's continuing effort to expand
commercial and diplomatic ties with China had been upset by
Beijing's test in March of missiles off the coast of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Berger has said the April 1996 briefing was not sufficiently
detailed to prompt action.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' last month, he said the
information he was told three years ago was ``very general and very
preliminary.'' In addition, he said, ``we did not have a suspect''
in the theft of the W-88 technology.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But other officials offered a different account of Berger's
briefing. The White House said it believes the briefing occurred on
April 13, 1996, but was not sure of the exact date and has no
records of what was said that day.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said the briefing was more detailed than Berger
has described and was the culmination of a five-month inter-agency
study of the W-88 theft and related issues. ``It was a pretty
specific briefing,'' one American official who was present said.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Curtis, the deputy secretary of Energy, led the Energy
Department's delegation at the White House briefing. The main
briefer was Notra Trulock, then the Energy Department's chief of
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Trulock's briefing, officials said, specifically covered the
theft of the W-88 technology and concluded that China had likely
obtained data about the miniaturized warhead, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said Berger was also told that investigators had
identified a prime suspect in the theft and would shortly turn
their information over to the FBI for a formal criminal inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Berger and Curtis agreed that the congressional intelligence
committees would be briefed on the W-88 matter following the
referal to the FBI (Congress was informed that summer.)
</P>
<P>
   According to the officials, the 1996 White House briefing also
discussed how the stolen technology could fit into Beijing's
nuclear strategy. Trulock suggested that China could use the W-88
technology as part of a plan to rely on the mobility of
truck-launched missiles with small warheads to better survive
nuclear attacks, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the April briefing, officials said, Trulock said
there was new information that China may recently have stolen
neutron bomb data. He was referring to the spy's report, which had
been received by the Energy Department from the FBI on March 27,
1996, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The neutron bomb intelligence was ``hot off the press,'' and it
was included to warn the White House of the possibility of
continuing Chinese espionage, one official said.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis told Trulock at the meeting to follow up the neutron bomb
information with a broader inquiry into Chinese espionage efforts
at the weapons labs, one official said.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department completed an analysis of the neutron bomb
case in July 1996, and it unearthed some intriguing connections.
The study, officials said, raised the possibility that the chief
suspect in the W-88, a computer scientist in Los Alamos, had also
been involved in the transfer to China of neutron bomb secrets.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect, Wen Ho Lee, was dismissed from his job last month
after the Energy Department said he violated security regulations.
No criminal charges have been filed against him. Officials said the
FBI has investigated the Energy Department's theory but has not
been able to establish that Lee has any connection to the neutron
bomb case.
</P>
<P>
   As they investigated further, Energy Department officials
discovered that Lee had attended a classified meeting in 1992 in
which solutions to the neutron bomb's design flaw were discussed,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI, officials said, had also found that Lee had made at
least one telephone call to the scientist at Lawrence Livermore who
was suspected of having provided the Chinese with the original
neutron bomb data in the late 1970s and early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   According to the FBI's informant, Chinese officials were
boasting in 1995 about obtaining new data from the United States
but did not specifically mention the government's weapons
laboratories. American officials say the FBI has not found any
evidence linking the weapons laboratories to the suspected theft of
neutron bomb secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials said it is difficult to evaluate China's
progress on developing a neutron bomb because they have not
detected any testing of such a weapon since 1996, when Beijing
agreed to a moratorium on tests.
</P>
<P>
   The informant's report, however, was one of several pieces of
intelligence pointing to the vulnerability of the laboratories to
espionage.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1996, shortly before he left the government, Curtis
ordered a series of measures to tighten security. But the White
House was apparently not notified of Curtis's directives, most of
which were ignored or delayed by Energy Department officials.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1997 Trulock returned to the White House to present his
wider findings to Berger, who had become Clinton's National
Security Adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Berger, in turn, now says that that briefing prompted him to
tell Clinton about China's nuclear espionage and concerns about lab
security. But late last year, in a sworn reply to the select House
committee headed by Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., Berger said the
president was not told about the espionage until 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to explain the discrepancy, Leavy said ``after the Cox
Committee process we've remembered more.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has said he was not aware of any Chinese espionage
taking place during his administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the best of my knowledge, no one has said anything to me
about any espionage which occurred by the Chinese against the labs,
during my Presidency,'' he said at a news conference last month.
</P>
<P>
   Leavy declined to say whether Clinton has been briefed on the
intelligence about the possible theft of neutron bomb data during
his Presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, Cox and the ranking Democrat on the committee,
Norm Dicks of Washington, wrote President Clinton requesting a
meeting to discuss their report. Leavy said the White House was
working on scheduling a meeting. The committee has completed its
work but is still consulting with the administration over how much
of its final report can be made public.

<P>
   Time passes _ of course, one is prompted to ask, what else is
time to do? Time blurs. Time enhances. Time tricks us. But it
doesn't really stand still, no matter what we read or hear or feel.
</P>
<P>
   Time has elevated Henry Aaron, at long last, to his rightful
place as one of baseball's deities. Twenty-five years after he
broke Babe Ruth's career home run record, on April 8, 1974, the
recognition that was oddly denied him at the moment has come to
this most unassuming of players. Undiluted, unquestioned,
uncluttered by trivia, Aaron is honored now as the greatest
performer of his era.
</P>
<P>
   His teammates, Warren Spahn and Eddie Mathews, said so. The
revered Ted Williams, the precise Stan Musial and the adored Mickey
Mantle said so. The two most dominant pitchers of his generation,
Sandy Koufax and Bob Gibson, said so. More important, time says so.
</P>
<P>
   The past has become an ally, not his enemy. No longer does he
chase Babe Ruth's ghost through a long, winding, fog-shrouded
alley. The comparisons to Mantle and Willie Mays are still there,
but the numbers are in and they all shout the same name: Hank
Aaron. He was a power hitter who could steal bases, an outfielder
who made hard catches look easy.
</P>
<P>
   Mantle, among others, observed that if Henry had spent his
career in such media centers as New York or Los Angeles, instead of
such outposts as Milwaukee and Atlanta, there would have been no
debate about his greatness.
</P>
<P>
   The longest countdown the game had known began in earnest in
April 1971, when Aaron drilled his 600th homer off Gaylord Perry of
the Giants. At age 37, he would clear the fence 47 times, a
personal best, and bat .327. For the better part of four years, or
roughly the time it took Michelangelo to paint the ceiling of the
Sistine Chapel, the media and the public would track his progress.
</P>
<P>
   He continued to plod away, placing one stone atop the other,
while millions kept score. It was to be the lengthiest chase scene
in sports. He conducted himself handsomely, seldom if ever rude, if
not always accommodating. The pressures that surrounded him were
unknown to Ruth, for two reasons. Unlike the Babe, Hank had a goal
to pursue, creating enormous suspense in the process.
</P>
<P>
   And communications on the planet had undergone a radical change
in 40 years. Radio and television carried the news instantly to
every corner of the globe, and the computer had invaded even that
holy sanctuary, the baseball press box.
</P>
<P>
   An army of journalists tested his capacity to cope. Despite all
the new notoriety, Henry continued to drive a Chevrolet. His
wardrobe was still modest and his lifestyle anything but lavish. He
was sensitive about giving anyone the impression that he was a big
shot. He had the normal vanity of one who excelled at his work, but
high-rolling was a tender subject.
</P>
<P>
   He went to lengths to avoid the appearance of immodesty,
recalling vividly the thin days of his childhood in Mobile, Ala.,
where his father was a laborer on the dry docks, supporting a wife
and eight kids.
</P>
<P>
   Adrift at 17 with the Indianapolis Clowns of the Negro League,
Henry caught the eye of scouts for the Boston Braves and the New
York Giants, and the teams competed for him. The Giants offered
$150 a month. The Braves went to $350. So, for $200 a month, the
Giants walked away from the man who would one day smash more home
runs than Ruth. In the process, they lost the chance to present an
outfield that would have included Mays and Aaron.
</P>
<P>
   Up until the time he signed with the Braves and was shipped to a
farm club, Henry had never ridden in an airplane. His meal
allowance was $2 a day. The players ate mostly out of grocery
stores.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he was hunting down the Babe, Aaron was among the
highest salaried stars at $200,000 a year, but still underpaid. His
mail reflected the fierce resistance of the same purists who
rejected Roger Maris. But the hate mail and death threats poured in
as well, from the bigots who were inflamed by the idea of a black
Alabaman eclipsing the Babe. They were a flyspeck _ it was hoped _
of the population.
</P>
<P>
   When Hank finished the 1973 season with 713 home runs, the sport
was left dangling by its thumbs. You half expected the Braves to
transfer him to the Manned Space Center in Houston, where he would
be kept in quarantine, shielded from anyone bearing germs. On
visiting day, his family would talk to him through a glass
partition.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, a mild storm developed when the Braves announced Henry
would be held out of the opening series of the 1974 season at
Cincinnati, thus assuring a sellout in Atlanta for the home opener,
and beyond. The commissioner, Bowie Kuhn, responded by ordering
Aaron to play all three games against the Reds, or face a severe,
if unidentified, penatly.
</P>
<P>
   Henry not only played, but predictably hit his 714th homer off
Jack Billingham on opening day to tie the record.
</P>
<P>
   Now the scene shifted to Fulton County Stadium, on the night of
April 8, with a full house that did not include the commissioner.
In the fourth inning, Aaron stepped in to face lefty Al Downing of
the Dodgers. Milo Hamilton, now the familiar voice of the Houston
Astros, was calling the game on radio for Atlanta. The home plate
umpire was Satch Davidson, a Houston resident since his retirement.
</P>
<P>
   As he left the batter's box, Aaron said to Dusty Baker, who
followed him in the batting order: ``I'm tired of all this. I'm
ready to get it over with.''
</P>
<P>
   And, now, here's Milo:
</P>
<P>
   ``The crowd is up all around. The pitch to him bounced it up
there, ball one (loud boos). Henry Aaron in the second inning
walked and scored. He's sitting on 714. Here's the pitch by Downing
swinging there's a drive into left-center field. That ball is gonna
beee OUTA HERE! IT'S GONE! IT'S 715! THERE'S A NEW HOME RUN
CHAMPION OF ALL TIME, AND IT'S HENRY AARON ''
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of 53,775 exploded in rapture. Among the enduring sights
of that evening was a young Atlanta relief pitcher, Tom House,
catching the ball in the bullpen and racing down the foul line to
home plate to hand the priceless souvenir to Aaron, who was being
embraced by his mother and swarmed by his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   And so the deed was done by the player his fans called The
Hammer.
</P>
<P>
   As much as he prizes the most extended of all power records, as
much as he enjoys being called The Home Run King, he points out
softly that it is only a part of his story. He ranks first on the
all-time list for runs batted in, extra base hits and total bases,
second in runs scored, third in hits (behind Pete Rose and Ty
Cobb.)
</P>
<P>
   He was not exactly shortchanged in the glory department. He was,
after all, admired by millions and swept into the Hall of Fame on
the first ballot.
</P>
<P>
   But he was not larger than life, as Ruth was. He lacked the
showmanship of Mays or the boyish charm of Mantle or the temper of
Ted Williams.
</P>
<P>
   He was understated and effortless in the style of Joe DiMaggio.
He played the game as if it was an art, not a competition. He was
grace in a gray flannel suit. Mays was a bit of a ham. Aaron was as
smooth as a swan gliding along a lake. Williams attacked the ball.
Aaron got it to cooperate with him.
</P>
<P>
   He hit 755 home runs in 23 years, without ever producing 50 in a
season. His homers were usually line drives, not the high, soaring
swats of Ruth or the orbital explosions of a Mark McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   He hit his first home run off Vic Raschi of the Yankees on April
23, 1954, and his last off Dick Drago of the Angels on July 20,
1976. In the years since he retired, his poise and skills as a
speaker have grown dramatically. He moved into the executive
offices of the Braves, and has spoken out frequently on baseball's
failure to address minority hirings. He feels secure about his
place in baseball lore.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron was a tough out because he had a classic stroke and was
rarely out of control. He weighed 180 and his home runs were the
results of quick wrists, not strength. He had patience and sharp
eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Hank once fouled off a dozen pitches against Sandy Koufax, who
finally stepped off the mound, rubbed up the ball and called down
to him: ``Hank, it's me and you now. I'm going to throw my best
fastball right down the middle, and you're either going to hit it
out of the park or not out of the park. But there will be no more
foul balls.''
</P>
<P>
   On the next pitch, Aaron popped up.
</P>
<P>
   Then and now, the essence of the sport was the great hitter
against a great pitcher. This element, and more, is captured in a
superb coffee-table book called Home Run, My Life in Pictures,
celebrating the 25th anniversary of Aaron's record.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Gibson provides a rare, lovely, funny insight: ``Aaron had
reached base somehow. He was going to steal second on me, and I
went into my stretch. A lot of guys tried to time me. Well, I went
into my stretch and I looked over my shoulder, and he started
running. I turned around and chased him. I got within about four
feet from him, and he was standing there facing me
</P>
<P>
   ``We both were standing still. He would fake to the left and I'd
fake to the left. He'd fake to the right and I'd fake to the right.
I started grinning and I said, ``I got you now.' And he started
laughing, then he just fell on the ground and I touched him.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not often, in his illustrious 23-year career, that anyone
caught Henry Aaron off base.
