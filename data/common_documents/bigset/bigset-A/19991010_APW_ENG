<HEADLINE> Second Funny Car Win for Johnson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILLINGTON, Tenn. (AP) -- Tommy Johnson Jr. defeated Team Castrol  
on Sunday at the AutoZone Nationals presented by Pennzoil to claim 
his second Funny Car victory of the season in his third straight 
final-round appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson covered the Memphis Motorsports Park quarter-mile in  
4.996 seconds at 300.33 mph to defeat Tony Pedregon in the final, 
90 minutes after beating Winston points leader John Force, 
Pedregon's teammate. 
</P>
<P>
	Doug Herbert, Mike Edwards, Angelle Seeling and Brad Jeter won  
their pro categories at the $1.7 million race, the 19th of 22 
events in the $40 million NHRA Winston Drag Racing Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Herbert defeated Jim Head in a classic tire-smoking battle for  
his fourth victory of the season and second straight. Herbert drove 
his Snap-on Tools dragster to a 5.635 at 261.22, while Head lost 
traction and posted a slower 6.242 at 279.85. 
</P>
<P>
	Edwards claimed his second consecutive victory in Pro Stock,  
using a holeshot start to defeat Richie Stevens. Edwards ran 6.976 
at 197.59 in his Dewco Performance Camaro Z28 and crossed the 
finish line just in front of the quicker Stevens, who covered the 
distance in 6.935 at 197.22. 
</P>
<P>
	Seeling also used a holeshot to score her fifth Pro Stock  
Motorcycle victory of the season, defeating Fred Collis, who made 
his NHRA debut. Seeling, who moved into the Winston points lead 
with the win, posted a 7.398 at 178.50, while Collis ran a quicker, 
but losing 7.370 at 177.37. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeter won his second Pro Stock Truck title of the season,  
running 7.605 at 176.67 to defeat fellow Chevy S-10 driver Randy 
Daniels, who slowed with a 8.786 at 114.53.

<HEADLINE> Doctor Starts Work at 55 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Dr. Robert Lopatin's prescription for a  
fulfilling, no-regrets life: Don't be afraid of change, and never 
pass up an opportunity to try something new. 
</P>
<P>
	He's taken a healthy dose of his own medicine. At 55, Lopatin is  
fresh out of medical school, one of the oldest first-year residents 
in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	He works 100-hour weeks, including exhausting overnight calls,  
alongside colleagues young enough to be his children, while 
physicians his own age may ponder retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	Why bother?  
</P>
<P>
	Lopatin dreamed as a boy of becoming a doctor, but put his  
interest in medicine aside during college and eventually went into 
business with his father. The two ran a women's clothing company 
for 27 years. A year or so after they sold it in the early 1990s, 
Lopatin decided it wasn't too late to fulfill his longtime dream. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like nirvana,'' he said. ``I feel like I died and was  
born again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When, at age 51, he began studying at the Albert Einstein  
College of Medicine, he was older than most of his professors -- 
even older than the school itself. But he felt completely at home. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just thrilling, this feeling of picking up the pieces  
of something one had left aside,'' he recalled. ``I felt somewhat 
out of place as an older person, but as a student I felt absolutely 
in my element.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now half a year out of med school, Lopatin has just started a  
four-year residency at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx. A 
bachelor, he has moved out of his Manhattan apartment to live 
closer to the hospital and says it's hard to find time for friends 
and family. 
</P>
<P>
	But he wouldn't have it any other way.  
</P>
<P>
	``When you're older, once you do make a commitment to something  
... there's more purposefulness,'' he said. ``Things stay more in 
perspective.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lopatin admits the hours are tough. Six-thirty a.m. to midnight  
workdays are common, and graveyard shifts are required four times a 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	But he believes his maturity helps him practice better medicine,  
and colleagues and patients agree. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a fabulous intern because he has a true devotion to what  
he's doing,'' says his supervisor, Dr. Lawrence Brandt. ``Being 
older, he sees things from a different perspective. ... Patients 
immediately latch onto his positive qualities and see someone who 
they can trust.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ramona Cosme, 86, was treated recently by Lopatin and said she  
felt more comfortable with him than she would with a twenty- or 
thirty-something doctor. 
</P>
<P>
	``He really worries about the patients,'' she said in Spanish.  
``A person of a certain age has already gone through experiences of 
life ... and had a chance to reflect upon them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lopatin's late leap to medicine was completely in character for  
a man whose life has been a continuous quest for education. 
</P>
<P>
	After long days working as a garment industry executive, he  
studied art history at Columbia University at night, completing all 
the requirements for a Ph.D. except his dissertation. He studied 
clothing production at the Fashion Institute of Technology and took 
classes in Spanish, French, Italian, German and Yiddish. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never been out of school,'' he explained. ``It just makes  
me feel alive; that's who I am.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When he left the garment industry in 1991, he headed straight  
for the classroom, though medicine wasn't yet on his mind. He 
studied Shakespeare and Latin, took calculus, enrolled in a U.N. 
training program for Spanish language interpreters. 
</P>
<P>
	Still intrigued by art history, he joined an archeological dig  
in Belgium in 1992. At a friend's wedding in Zurich, he happened to 
sit near a young man who'd just finished medical school. Talking 
with him reminded Lopatin of his own boyhood dream. 
</P>
<P>
	``How many times is a person ... genuinely free to be able to  
restart their life?'' he asked. ``I said to myself, 'I have to at 
least pursue it ... because if I don't I will be forever filled 
with self-reproach. I will have failed myself.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Lopatin entered a New York University pre-med program and was  
soon taking classes in biology, chemistry and physics. 
</P>
<P>
	He knew right away he'd made a good choice.  
</P>
<P>
	``It took a lot of ... imagination to do it, to get myself to do  
it, but once I undertook it, it just felt so right,'' he said. ``I 
felt I was home again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So what comes next?  
</P>
<P>
	Even now, Lopatin doesn't expect his career path to be straight.  
He says he might like to study for a master's degree in public 
health and get involved in international health care policy. 
</P>
<P>
	One thing's for sure: ``I'll die a doctor, whenever that  
comes.''

<HEADLINE> Relief Workers Get Lesson on Kids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When Dr. Karen Olness packed her bags to go  
help care for Rwandan refugees fleeing genocide, she threw in five 
toys. The payoff came soon enough: several hundred injured orphans 
enjoying a few minutes of pleasure in a hospital that had lacked 
even a single plaything. 
</P>
<P>
	For healthy Kurdish toddlers who fled Iraq, she recalled, it  
took little more than a week before they began suffering from 
malnutrition that could leave their developing brains permanently 
damaged. 
</P>
<P>
	In such humanitarian disasters, children require special  
physical and emotional care that too many ``otherwise heroic'' 
relief workers do not understand or know how to address, said 
Olness, a pediatrician with 30 years' experience in working with 
children who have escaped wars or natural disasters. 
</P>
<P>
	She has developed a new handbook of practical advice so relief  
workers can better protect youngsters' health. The guide, unveiled 
Sunday at a meeting of the American Academy of Pediatrics, is part 
of a campaign that beginning next year will send experts like 
Olness to disaster sites around the world to train relief workers. 
Funding the effort is the charitable Johnson &AMP; Johnson Pediatric 
Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	``Children are not little adults,'' said Olness, a Case Western  
Reserve University doctor. 
</P>
<P>
	Children become malnourished and dehydrated faster than adults,  
and are far more susceptible to disease. They also seem especially 
vulnerable to psychological trauma. 
</P>
<P>
	But, she said, research shows there are ways to mitigate the  
danger; some are fairly simple, such as recognizing a child's vital 
need for play or easy checks for malnutrition. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most often governments and others worry about the adults  
because those are the folks who complain. The kids tend to get 
lost,'' said Dr. Errol Alden of the pediatrics group. 
</P>
<P>
	As the number of humanitarian disasters has grown from about six  
a year in the 1980s to over 15 a year this decade, ``we've become 
more and more concerned,'' Alden said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those concerns:  
</P>
<P>
	--Even brief periods of severe malnutrition can damage a young  
child's brain, resulting in long-term learning disabilities or 
other problems. Even if a refugee camp seems to have adequate food, 
adults may steal unaccompanied children's share, and young children 
absorb nutrition in smaller doses so a once-a-day camp ration could 
still leave toddlers starving. 
</P>
<P>
	--Children's immature immune systems are vulnerable to disease.  
Lack of vitamin A from malnutrition increases chances of death from 
measles, which commonly sweeps through refugee camps. Children do 
not understand hygiene, easily spreading diarrheal diseases and 
playing in contaminated water supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	--Children may not be able to explain to relief workers if they  
have a lifethreatening food allergy. 
</P>
<P>
	--Children orphaned or separated from family suffer particular  
psychological trauma, and need protection from exploitation and 
abuse. In addition, youngsters ages of 7 to 12 are at a critical 
stage in learning the concepts of right and wrong. Displaced 
children without appropriate role models can grow up with a warped 
sense of morality. 
</P>
<P>
	Relief workers reading the Helping the Children handbooks --  
which will be available in several languages -- will learn that 
children and nursing mothers should get priority in distributing 
existing food. They will find advice on ways to figure how to 
preserve young children's rations for multiple feedings and on 
immunizing refugee children. 
</P>
<P>
	The handbook offers easy health exams to catch malnutrition  
early -- pressing a thumb against a child's foot for a few seconds 
to see if the skin properly bounces back is one example. 
</P>
<P>
	Olness says relief workers also must remember that little things  
such as bringing toys and providing children the security of a 
daily routine greatly relieve stress. She recalled giving Kosovo 
refugees paper and crayons, and they sat under a tree making 
therapeutic pictures of their experiences. 
</P>
<P>
	Such things ``may not seem like top priorities, but they can  
make a huge difference,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Dixie Union Wins Norfolk Stakes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARCADIA, Calif. (AP) -- Dixie Union, ridden by Alex Solis, went  
wide on the turn and still overtook Forest Camp in the stretch for 
a half-length victory Sunday in the $200,000 Norfolk Stakes at 
Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
	Dixie Union covered the mile on the turf in 1:35.79.  
</P>
<P>
	Forest Camp, who took the lead soon after the start but was  
passed by Dixie Union near the sixteenth pole, finished four 
lengths in front of Anees. New Advantage, Slayton and Radix Alis 
completed the order of finish in the race for 2-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kentucky-bred Dixie Union, trained by Richard Mandella,  
earned $120,000. 
</P>
<P>
	This was Dixie Union's first race around two turns. His first  
loss in four tries was to Forest Camp in last month's Del Mar 
Futurity, where he lost by five lengths. 
</P>
<P>
	Dixie Union paid $10.40, $2.40 and $2.10. Forest Camp returned  
$2.10 and $2.10, while Anees paid $2.10 to show.

<HEADLINE> Jets Brace for Jaguars Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J (AP) -- The Jacksonville Jaguars aren't  
looking at the New York Jets as just another opponent. They're 
approaching Monday night's game as an opportunity to slap down a 
championship contender. 
</P>
<P>
	Sure, the Jets are 1-3 and racked with injuries. Never mind,  
according to the Jaguars (3-1), who still believe the road to their 
first Super Bowl could go through the Meadowlands. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you win, it puts those guys farther from making the  
playoffs,'' Jacksonville receiver Keenan McCardell said. ``That's a 
team capable of getting on a run. Knock them out early and you 
won't have to deal with them later.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Jets were reeling, ready for a knockout, before winning  
their first game last weekend at Denver. Coincidentally, it was the 
Broncos who knocked them out of the playoffs in last season's AFC 
title game, and it was the Jets who knocked the Jags out of the 
playoffs the previous week. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, New York believes it has some life. Beating Jacksonville  
would reinforce those feelings and keep the Jets looking up and 
feeling up. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just like a loss causes you to second-guess,'' linebacker  
Bryan Cox said, ``a win causes you to exude confidence. You can put 
yourself on a roll, that's what winning does, it adds a certain 
amount of confidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both teams' confidence should come from the performances of  
their defenses. Although their offenses were touted coming into the 
season, New York's has sputtered greatly due to injuries, while 
Jacksonville's has been inconsistent since an opening rout of San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	The defenses have turned around some games, most notably last  
week in the Jets' victory at Denver, when they forced six 
turnovers, and in the Jaguars' win at Pittsburgh, when they held 
the Steelers to 216 yards of offense. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacksonville is far more aggressive on defense under new  
coordinator Dom Capers, the former Carolina head coach who came to 
prominence while overseeing Pittsburgh's superb defenses earlier in 
the decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not totally different, but we do have different people  
who are performing and performing well,'' coach Tom Coughlin said. 
``We don't have as many health issues. Guys are on the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got guys like Carnell Lake, Gary Walker, Fernando  
Bryant, Tony Brackens being able to stay healthy. Lonnie Marts is 
making his contribution. It's a matter of different people, playing 
with confidence, and guys who are meeting the physical challenge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It will present a strong challenge to the Jets, who might have  
star receiver Wayne Chrebet back from a broken foot. That would 
make quarterback Rick Mirer's job a lot easier. 
</P>
<P>
	Mirer hasn't hurt the Jets the last two weeks, but he hasn't  
been sensational, either. New York will settle for solid from the 
man who has replaced Vinny Testaverde (torn Achilles' tendon). 
</P>
<P>
	And Jacksonville would settle for the same from its struggling  
attack, from quarterback Mark Brunell to the running backs, 
receivers and line. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason we've struggled is the little things,'' Brunell  
said. ``I don't know if it's pressing too much or not enough. We've 
got to get it going. Everyone realizes that. No one is more 
disappointed in it than we are as players, because we think we've 
got a pretty good offense. We'll get it going. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of times in my career, we've been in a slump.  
Fortunately, all those times, we've come out of it. We've grown and 
we've learned. This is no different. We've got some improving to do 
and we'll do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If they do it Monday night, one potential playoff thorn might be  
as good as removed.

	UFCW Labor Union Backs Gore  
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The board of the United Food and Commercial  
Workers voted unanimously today to put its 1.4 million members 
behind Vice President Al Gore in his bid for the Democratic 
presidential nomination. The endorsement came at the urging of John 
Sweeney, president of the AFL-CIO labor federation, who met 
privately with the UFCW board today to press Gore's case. UFCW 
President Doug Dority spoke with both Gore and Democratic rival 
Bill Bradley over the weekend. Presidents of the AFL-CIO's biggest 
unions, including the UFCW, will vote to recommend the federation's 
overall endorsement, which in turn will be decided by all 68 member 
unions.

	Mexico Flooding Death Toll at 333  
</P>
<P>
	VILLAHERMOSA, Mexico (AP) -- Angry over sandbagging that has  
swamped their neighborhoods and furious that the government hasn't 
done more to help, hundreds of people in Tabasco's flooded capital 
clashed today with police. Many were beaten and arrested. The death 
toll, according to officials in the affected states, stands at 333. 
But hundreds more were missing, and unofficial counts by local 
newspapers -- based in part on witness accounts -- put the death toll 
as high as 600. President Ernesto Zedillo has called the flooding 
Mexico's worst disaster in a decade.

	Israel To Open Gaza Route Next Week  
</P>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- A safe passage route for Palestinian travel  
between Gaza and the West Bank was expected to open in a week, 
Palestinian and Israeli officials said Sunday. The 27-mile passage, 
allowing thousands of Palestinians to visit each other, would be 
the most substantive result of the peace process revived last month 
by Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser 
Arafat.

	GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- Chechnya's President Aslan Maskhadov  
outlined a peace plan Sunday to end the fighting in his breakaway 
republic, and promised to crack down on renegade warlords if Russia 
withdraws its troops from Chechen territory. He called on Russia to 
immediately end ``all combat actions,'' and said the two sides 
should observe the basic principles of a peace accord that ended 
the 1994-96 Chechen war. Russia did not respond immediately but was 
expected to reject several of Maskhadov's keys points, including 
the withdrawal of Russian forces.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Unabomber Ted Kaczynski insists in an interview  
that he is not crazy, and says he would have preferred the death 
penalty to life in prison. ``I'm confident that I'm sane,'' he 
tells Time magazine in its Oct. 18 issue, on newsstands tomorrow. 
The interview coincides with the imminent release of Kaczynski's 
book-- ``Truth Versus Lies,'' published by Context Books.

	Report: Castro Let Jews Go To Israel  
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Cuban President Fidel Castro agreed to a secret  
deal that allowed 400 Jews to emigrate to Israel, The Sunday 
Telegraph reported. Speaking on condition of anonymity, an Israeli 
official confirmed the report and said 400 immigrants arrived more 
than a year ago and have been living in the southern coastal city 
of Ashkelon. Cuba has no formal ties with Israel, having broken off 
relations after Israel's victory in the Yom Kippur War in 1973, so 
the exit visas were granted through Canada, the London-based 
newspaper said.

	Schroeder's Party Recovers in Berlin Vote

	BERLIN (AP) -- Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's Social Democrats  
recovered from a string of losses and held their own in local 
elections Sunday, ensuring that the party would retain a stable 
minority in Berlin's local government. The ballot also marked a 
triumph for incumbent mayor Eberhard Diepgen, who was certain to be 
appointed to a fourth term after a strong vote for the conservative 
Christian Democrats.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House dispatched Cabinet members  
today to press the Senate to put off voting on a nuclear test ban 
treaty headed for rejection, saying a defeat would endanger 
nonproliferation efforts. One Republican opponent, Sen. Jon Kyl of 
Arizona, voicing widespread GOP concerns about verification, said 
he welcomed a chance ``to go back to the drawing board.'' He 
predicted certain defeat of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty if 
the expected vote Tuesday goes forward.

<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- The Chicago Bears defeated the Minnesota  
Vikings 24-22 today by forcing five turnovers and turning three of 
them into touchdowns. Chicago improved to 3-2 under new coach Dick 
Jauron. Minnesota, which reached the NFC title game last year, fell 
to 2-3. Bears quarterback Shane Matthews completed 19 of 28 passes 
for 184 yards and two touchdowns before pulling his right hamstring 
while scrambling early in the fourth quarter.

<HEADLINE> Mets' Benitez To Be Fined </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Armando Benitez, who nearly blew Game 4 of the  
NL playoffs for the New York Mets, will be fined for showing up 
only a half-hour before game time. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't come late without a fine,'' Mets manager Bobby  
Valentine said Sunday, a day after the Mets completed their 
first-round series win over Arizona. ``There will be a fine, and 
we'll handle that internally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because Game 3 was played Friday night and Saturday's game  
started just after 1 p.m. EDT, batting practice was optional before 
Game 4. Players were required to be in uniform for pregame 
stretching at about 11:45 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would say he was at least 45 minutes later,'' Valentine  
said. ``It wasn't the greatest news before a game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Valentine didn't seem interested in the reason for the  
tardiness. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure he was not there on time because he left his house  
late,'' Valentine said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he had not yet spoken with the reliever and Valentine  
wouldn't talk about the amount of the fine. 
</P>
<P>
	``The discipline is really none of anybody's business,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	After Benitez finally arrived at Shea Stadium, Valentine's  
concern was finding out whether he was healthy and available to 
pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	Benitez entered in the eighth inning with a 2-1 lead, but  
allowed a two-run double to Jay Bell. He then pitched the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was really happy to see the second inning,'' Valentine said,  
referring to the ninth. ``I was on pins and needles to make the 
decision to have him go out there, not because they hit two balls 
solid, because that I was unsure of his condition. So I rolled the 
dice to send him out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Valentine and general manager Steve Phillips did not  
know if third base coach Cookie Rojas would be fined for his 
altercation with left field umpire Charlie Williams in the bottom 
of the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
	After Williams called Darryl Hamilton's liner with two on foul --  
replays showed it was the correct call -- Rojas argued vehemently. 
After he was ejected, the coach gave Williams a two-handed push and 
needed several Mets to restrain him. 
</P>
<P>
	NL president Len Coleman planned to review videotape of the  
argument on Monday.

<HEADLINE> Report: Castro Let Jews Go To Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Cuban President Fidel Castro agreed to a secret  
deal that allowed 400 Jews to emigrate to Israel, The Sunday 
Telegraph reported. 
</P>
<P>
	An Israeli official confirmed the report. Speaking on condition  
of anonymity, the official said 400 immigrants arrived more than a 
year ago and have been living in the southern coastal city of 
Ashkelon. Most are students and hope their parents still in Cuba 
will be allowed to emigrate as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba has no formal ties with Israel, having broken off relations  
after Israel's victory in the Yom Kippur War in 1973, so the exit 
visas were granted through Canada, the London-based newspaper said, 
citing unnamed sources in Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	There has been no mention of the Jewish immigration in Cuba's  
government-controlled news media. Officials with Cuba's Foreign 
Ministry were not available for comment on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Castro is known to want to improve Cuba's image abroad and  
encourage Washington to consider lifting the nearly 40-year-old 
economic embargo wrecking the nation's economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The official said he expected that other Jews who want to leave  
Cuba would be allowed out by next June. 
</P>
<P>
	Castro, accused of supplying arms to Palestinian terror groups,  
has long been hostile to Israel. While he never cracked down on 
Jews, the country officially embraced atheism in 1962, forcing many 
to shy away from public worship. 
</P>
<P>
	In the early 1990s, however, the constitution was changed to  
make the government secular. For the first time, believers of all 
faiths were accepted in the Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the Cuban government is desperate for new trading  
partners. The fall of communism cut off $6 billion in annual aid 
from the Soviet Union, Margalit Bejarano, of the Hebrew University 
in Jerusalem, was quoted as telling The Sunday Telegraph. 
</P>
<P>
	``Castro is seeking out new economic ties, including ones with  
Israel,'' Bejarano was quoted as saying. ``He has no choice but to 
change policy to survive ... The people need dollars, and they 
believe that letting Jews go would make a good impression on 
Washington.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most Cuban Jews are descendants of Polish and Russian Jews who  
fled pogroms at the turn of the century. While most in the Jewish 
community initially supported Castro after his 1959 revolution, 
many left Cuba after he turned toward socialism and their 
businesses were expropriated or shut down. 
</P>
<P>
	In the four decades since Castro's revolution, the Jewish  
community in Cuba has shrunk from 15,000 to 1,500. There is no 
rabbi or Jewish school. There are just three synagogues in Havana 
and one kosher butcher. 
</P>
<P>
	The original contact between the Cubans and the  
quasi-governmental Jewish Agency in Israel, which brings Jews to 
the country, was made through the World Union of Jewish Students, 
the Israeli official said. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the Jewish Agency, Michael Jankelowitz, declined  
to comment on the newspaper report.

<HEADLINE> Blues 4, Oilers 2 / Hockey Game Story  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDMONTON, Alberta (AP) -- Geoff Courtnall's tie-breaking goal at  
15:19 of the third period lifted the St. Louis Blues to a 4-2 
victory over the Edmonton Oilers on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Louis center Pierre Turgeon became the 55th NHL player to  
reach 1,000 points with a power-play goal at 13:23 of the second 
period, tying the game 2-2 at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Pavol Demitra and Michal Handzus also scored for St. Louis,  
which won its second in a row to improve to 2-2-0-0. Doug Weight 
and Ryan Smyth scored for the Oilers (1-2-1-1). 
</P>
<P>
	Goalie Tommy Salo made 34 saves for Edmonton. Jamie McLennan  
faced just 21 shots in the St. Louis goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Weight jammed in his own rebound to open the scoring 4:49 into  
the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Demitra scored on a 2-on-1 break with Jochen Hecht following an  
Oilers giveaway at the St. Louis blue line. Hecht made a fine pass 
across to set up the goal at 9:04 of the first, tying the game 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Smyth was credited with a goal following a video review. He went  
to the net, fell in the crease and St. Louis captain Sean Pronger 
pushed the puck behind McLennan at 8:13 of the second. 
</P>
<P>
	Handzus clinched the win with 2:26 left in the third on a weak  
backhander in a shorthanded situation.

<HEADLINE> Reform Party Factions Spar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Reform Party leaders kept up their sniping at  
one another Sunday, using Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura and 
presidential hopeful Pat Buchanan as targets in a factional fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura, the party's highest-elected official, raised no  
objections to developer Donald Trump's potential candidacy for the 
party's presidential nomination. But Ventura questioned whether he 
could back Buchanan, who is considering leaving the GOP 
presidential race to seek the Reform Party nod. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the outgoing Reform Party chairman, Russell Verney, said  
Ross Perot, the party's presidential nominee in 1992 and 1996, has 
not ruled out a third run. 
</P>
<P>
	The loudest voices behind the internal bickering belonged to  
Verney and his successor, Jack Gargan, a Ventura ally who takes 
over Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Verney again pressed for Ventura to quit the party, citing  
comments the former wrestler made in a recent interview in Playboy 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other things, Ventura said organized religion is for  
``weak-minded people'' and that the Navy's Tailhook sexual 
harassment scandal was ``much ado about nothing.'' Ventura later 
said his remarks about religion referred to extremists and has said 
repeatedly since that he doesn't condone the actions at Tailhook. 
</P>
<P>
	Verney, speaking Sunday on NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' said  
Ventura's statements were ``an affront to the values of the members 
of the Reform Party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Gargan wondered why Verney was not condemning Buchanan with  
the same vengeance. A new book by the political commentator argues 
that Adolf Hitler was not a direct threat to the United States 
after 1940, a year before the United States entered World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	``How come we don't hear this righteous indignation that he  
(Buchanan) should be thrown out,'' Gargan asked. 
</P>
<P>
	``First, he's not a member of this party,'' Verney responded.  
``And second, if he's a member of this party and he's embodied as 
the leadership of this party in the public's mind, he will be held 
-- everyone will be held to the same standard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both Gargan and Ventura questioned whether the organization  
should nominate Buchanan. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very different on social issues,'' Ventura said on ABC's  
``This Week.'' ``Mr. Buchanan likes to put social issues to the 
forefront. We in the Reform Party traditionally have never done 
that, and I agree with that. I don't like putting social issues out 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Buchanan and Trump talk about seeking the Reform  
nomination, Verney said party founder Perot has not ruled out 
another presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ross Perot is one of the most effective communicators in  
America,'' Verney said on CNN's ``Late Edition.''

<HEADLINE> Gasoline Prices Dip Half a Cent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Gasoline prices dipped about half a cent  
nationwide over the past two weeks as crude oil prices took a dive, 
an industry analyst said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The weighted average nationwide as of Friday was $1.3288, down  
.53 cents per gallon from a Sept. 24 survey, said Trilby Lundberg, 
director of the Lundberg survey of 10,000 gasoline stations across 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The drop in gas prices follows a climb of more than 14 cents per  
gallon that started in early June, Lundberg said. The main reason 
for the decrease at the pump was the $4 per barrel decrease in 
crude oil price, Lundberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Crude oil prices may have risen too fast and too soon for  
global demand,'' Lundberg said. ``It's impossible to say where it 
will go from here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The price for a barrel of crude oil was $25 two weeks ago on the  
New York Mercantile Exchange, Lundberg said, but it is now less 
than $21 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lundberg survey showed a national average price for self  
service regular unleaded gasoline of $1.2777. Mid-grade unleaded 
was $1.3756 and premium unleaded was $1.4602. 
</P>
<P>
	For full service regular unleaded, the survey showed the average  
price was $1.6153 with mid-grade at $1.7008 and premium at $1.7753.

<HEADLINE> United States 4, Brazil 2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Mia Hamm scored the go-ahead goal in the  
60th minute as the United States beat Brazil 4-2 on Sunday, 
clinching the U.S. Women's Cup tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	With play around the Brazilian goal, Hamm took a left-footed  
cross from Kristine Lilly and fired with her left foot from about 
15 yards out. The goal was her second of the game, the record 114th 
of her international career and gave the Americans a 3-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Lilly added a penalty-kick goal in the 88th minute after Cindy  
Parlow was fouled inside the penalty area. 
</P>
<P>
	The win gave the United States a sweep of the four-team  
round-robin tournament. However, this win was nothing like earlier 
easy victories over South Korea, by 5-0, and Finland, by 6-0. This 
time, a crowd of 35,211 at the University of Louisville's Cardinal 
Stadium saw the home team get a serious test. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brazilian striker Nildinha scored both her team's goals, as  
her team penetrated the interior of the American defense for more 
than half a dozen scoring chances in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
	The win was the Americans' 18th straight in international play  
since a 2-1 loss to China on April 25. The Americans are now 25-2-2 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States opened the scoring in the 18th minute, when  
Parlow got the ball ahead on a throw-in to Joy Fawcett, who touched 
it back to Hamm in the center of the goal area. Hamm juggled the 
ball momentarily, then shot right-footed to score from about 10 
yards out. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil responded on back-to-back goals by Nildinha. The first,  
in the 21st minute, came off an assist by Roseli, who got the ball 
ahead to Nildinha on a breakaway past American defender Christie 
Pearce. 
</P>
<P>
	Nildinha's shot past American goalie Brianna Scurry was the  
first score given up by the Americans in 636 minutes of soccer, 
dating back to the July 1 World Cup quarterfinal against Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine minutes later, Nildinha scored again when Cidinha dropped a  
pass from midfield behind the American defense and Nildinha buried 
the ball in the corner of the goal. It was the first time the 
Americans had trailed in a game since the Germany game, when they 
fell behind before winning 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
	Nildinha had a third breakaway chance, in the 24th minute, but  
Scurry stretched high to save a shot from about 20 yards out. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans got the equalizer in the 38th minute, when Lilly  
took a feed from Sara Whalen from about 20 yards out, turned and 
calmly fired an angled bullet high and past Andreia, the Brazilian 
goalie. 
</P>
<P>
	In the second half, the U.S. defense clamped down, and didn't  
surrender a shot on goal until the 81st minute, when Scurry made a 
spectacular save on a shot by Fabiana. 
</P>
<P>
	In the early game, Finland downed South Korea 3-0 as the South  
Koreans suffered their third straight shutout of the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Heidi Kackur opened the scoring in the 18th minute, shooting  
from point-blank range to the right of the goal off a cross from 
Christina Forssell. 
</P>
<P>
	Susana Heikari scored Finland's other goals, in the game's 58th  
and 84th minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korea had a chance to end its scoring drought on a penalty  
kick by Yu Jin Kim in the 89th minute, but her shot went wide right 
and the South Koreans finished the tournament having been outscored 
12-0.

<HEADLINE> Details About Post-Traumatic Stress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Post-traumatic stress disorder can occur as an acute disorder  
soon after the trauma,or have a delayed onset in which the symptoms 
occur more than 6 months after the trauma. 
</P>
<P>
	It can occur at any age and can follow a natural disaster such  
as flood or fire, a man-made disaster such as war or imprisonment, 
or violence such as assault or rape. Such events produce stress in 
anyone, but not everyone will develop the syndrome. The cause is 
not known, but psychological, genetic, physical, and social factors 
may contribute. 
</P>
<P>
	To be diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, the  
American Psychiatric Association says symptoms from each of these 
groups must severely interfere with your life for at least a month: 
</P>
<P>
	--Intrusion: The traumatic event suddenly ``intrudes'' into your  
life, often in vivid flashbacks or nightmares. You may have 
inexplicable sudden onslaughts of emotion. 
</P>
<P>
	--Avoidance: You may feel numb and avoid close ties with others  
as well as situations that remind you of the trauma. Depression, 
``survivor's guilt,'' shame and feelings of failure and 
unworthiness are common. 
</P>
<P>
	--Hyperarousal or hyperalertness: You may begin to act as if you  
were constantly threatened, becoming irritable, ``on guard'' or 
explosive for no reason. Difficulty concentrating or remembering, 
exaggerated ``startle reactions,'' insomnia and panic attacks are 
common.

<HEADLINE> WNBA Seeks Funds During NBA Lockout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Seattle's WNBA expansion team has sold the 5,500  
season tickets it needed to secure a franchise, but coach Linn Dunn 
isn't celebrating. 
</P>
<P>
	The reason: The Seattle City Council is asking for more money  
for the team's three-year lease agreement at KeyArena, and team 
officials say they can't afford it. 
</P>
<P>
	Council president Sue Donaldson has drafted the proposal asking  
for an additional $50,000 a year from the team, which is scheduled 
to begin play next season. If the city council passes it Monday, 
Dunn says Seattle may not have a team after all. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who is Sue Donaldson?'' Dunn asked. ``I don't understand why  
she is doing this. Does she really want to be responsible for 
killing the WNBA's chance to come to Seattle? We won't have a team 
if this happens, I can tell you that right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The WNBA team -- which has no players, name or mascot yet -- faced  
an Oct. 15 deadline to sell 5,500 season tickets and get a 
contracted arena for games. 
</P>
<P>
	With high-profile support from fans like Gov. Gary Locke -- who  
announced last Wednesday that he and his wife were sending in their 
$50 deposits for two season tickets -- the team garnered about 5,900 
ticket pledges by Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	But it might not matter.  
</P>
<P>
	While team officials thought they had a deal with the city,  
Donaldson said there is no agreement signed yet. The original 
proposal sought only expenses, such as ushers, from the team, she 
said, and the additional $50,000 per year is for actual rent. 
</P>
<P>
	Donaldson said the city is cautious after losing revenues from  
KeyArena during the NBA lockout at the start of the 1998-99 season. 
The city estimated it lost $3 million in revenue because of games 
not played by the Seattle SuperSonics. The council sought $341,144 
from the team, but the Sonics won in arbitration and paid only 
$34,000 for the 16 games that weren't played at the arena. 
</P>
<P>
	``We learned from dealing with the Ackerley Group and the NBA  
that we want to make the contract very clear,'' Donaldson said. 
``We don't feel the city should be manipulated again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Council member Peter Steinbrueck said the city is just trying to  
make sure it doesn't get burned if games get canceled. 
</P>
<P>
	``We shouldn't get stuck with these bills,'' Steinbrueck said.  
``There is a desire on the council to make a tighter contract with 
the WNBA because of the NBA. We all want the WNBA here, but it 
needs to be fair and equitable for both parties involved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Team officials complained about the last-minute nature of the  
proposal -- five days before Friday's deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a deal, and we moved forward on that deal,'' said Karen  
Bryant, the team's senior director of operations, who says the city 
and the team came to an agreement in June. ``To change it in the 
11th hour. ... Sue Donaldson owes an explanation to this 
community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Operating under Full House Sports &AMP; Entertainment, the business  
arm of both Seattle's WNBA and Sonics teams, a budget was set to 
bring the team to Seattle. Full House set ticket prices based on 
the team's budget, so adding another $50,000 per year in rent would 
sink the team, Bryant said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not going to happen,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Sonics pay $874,000 to use the arena. The WNBA team is  
paying considerably less than the $700,000 the city charges 
concerts, ice shows and other events -- an agreement to help the 
team get started.

<HEADLINE> Asians Caught Up in Space Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Throughout the Cold War, Asia kept pretty much to  
the ground as the United States and Soviet Union staged their 
ballyhooed battle for the moon. Now Asian nations are quietly 
caught up in a space race of their own. 
</P>
<P>
	While Japanese astronauts have traveled to outer space aboard  
American and Russian craft, China could soon become the first Asian 
nation to launch a man or woman there. And North Korea, though 
impoverished by famine, claims to have put into orbit an unmanned 
satellite singing the praises of its Great Leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Most ambitious of all has been Japan, which has sent a satellite  
around the moon, has a probe on its way to Mars and is the only 
Asian country to join the U.S.-led international space station. 
</P>
<P>
	But as the race speeds up, Japan is having some trouble staying  
ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until now, Japan's just been honing its space technology,''  
said Fujio Nakano, author of a newly published book on the nation's 
space industry. ``From here on out, we have to get into mass 
production, commercial development.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like the Cold War space race, Asia's ambitions are motivated  
more by strategic factors -- albeit with a post-Cold War twist of 
commercialism -- than by lofty scientific goals. 
</P>
<P>
	China, with a new rocket and a refurbished space center, is  
seeking to improve its satellite communications and develop 
space-based weapons. It is also counting on a highly secretive 
manned space program to put it on a technological par with the 
West. 
</P>
<P>
	In North Korea's case, whether the communist nation actually put  
a satellite into orbit last summer or was merely testing a 
long-range ballistic missile remains a matter of some debate. 
</P>
<P>
	But it is clear the politically isolated and otherwise backward  
country is rapidly improving the range and capabilities of its 
rockets -- and using that progress to extract concessions from the 
outside world. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Washington lifted long-standing economic sanctions  
against North Korea in an attempt to persuade the Pyongyang regime 
not to test long-range missiles. 
</P>
<P>
	The move was prompted by U.S. fears that North Korea was  
preparing a missile more powerful than the one it apparently lobbed 
over Japan last year. Experts say the improved Taepodong II would 
be able to reach Alaska and Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese officials prefer not to comment on whether they are  
being drawn into a regional space race. But government reaction to 
the new threat from North Korea indicates that is indeed the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo has vowed to launch the nation's first spy satellites in  
2003 and, with the help of the United States, set up a 
state-of-the-art regional missile defense system. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without that (North Korean) missile, none of this would have  
happened,'' said Hideshi Takesada of Japan's National Institute for 
Defense Studies. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the stress on strategic satellites is a new and  
controversial one for Japan. The nation currently relies entirely 
on U.S.-gathered intelligence, and a pacifist constitution combined 
with public wariness make it difficult to expand Japan's military 
role. 
</P>
<P>
	Until now, science has been the focus of Japan's space program,  
which has successfully put a satellite in orbit around the moon and 
docked two satellites in space by remote control -- a first, 
according to NASDA, Japan's space agency. 
</P>
<P>
	But the program has been plagued by bureaucratic wrangling, cost  
overruns and technical difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
	From rockets shutting down on the launch pad to the delayed  
liftoff of the country's first lunar probe, Japan's space program 
has had trouble lately just getting off the ground. Its latest 
attempt to launch a satellite was delayed for the third time last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had some problems,'' admitted Tatsushi Izumi of the  
Science and Technology Agency's Space Policy Division. He said 
Japan is trying to do too much with its $2.4 billion space budget. 
``We need to prioritize our goals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many experts say technical snags are a normal part of any space  
program and nothing to worry about. Writer Nakano said he is 
confident the new H-2A rocket, which Japan plans to launch soon on 
the commercial market, will put it on the level of European 
commercial launchers. 
</P>
<P>
	``For Japan, a country with so few resources, the  
knowledge-based space industry is irreplaceable,'' he said. ``The 
sense of competition is just about to begin.''

<HEADLINE> Despite Losses, Miami Optimistic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CORAL GABLES, Fla. (AP) -- The Miami Hurricanes lost their fifth  
straight game against Florida State and are on a three-game losing 
streak for only the second time in 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
	And they still have Virginia Tech and Syracuse, two ranked  
opponents, on their schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	But Miami coach Butch Davis isn't worried.  
</P>
<P>
	The Hurricanes (2-3), the only team to face No. 1 Florida State  
and No. 2 Penn State already this season, have one of the toughest 
schedules in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Their losses were by a combined 18 points. And they led in all  
three of their defeats, including blown fourth-quarter leads 
against the Nittany Lions and East Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis sees signs that his team, which fell from 19th to 24th in  
the rankings Sunday, is close to fully recovering from the 31 
scholarships it lost to NCAA sanctions between 1995 and 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``Two years ago the light at the end of the tunnel looked a long  
way off,'' said Davis, recalling an embarrassing 47-0 loss in 
Tallahassee in 1997. ``Today the light looks a hell of a lot 
closer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He just needs more quality players.  
</P>
<P>
	``Depth certainly is missing to a certain extent,'' Davis said  
Sunday, a day after the 31-21 loss to the Seminoles. ``Depth in 
some of the position places and experience, but that's what this 
season and seasons bring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This season still could bring a lot more for Miami.  
</P>
<P>
	After five nonconference games, the Hurricanes play seven  
straight Big East opponents beginning with Temple on Saturday. 
Winning the conference title would ensure Miami a spot in the Bowl 
Championship Series. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like two seasons,'' Davis said. ``We had five  
nonconference games, and those are over with. Now we've got to turn 
our attention to seven consecutive conference games and look at 
this as a fresh start. We're 0-0, and we'll see what happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Hurricanes hope to see quarterback Kenny Kelly play like he  
did against the Seminoles. He completed 27 of 41 passes for 370 
yards and three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Kelly threw his ninth interception of the season, Davis  
said he had the best performance of his two-year career. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kenny played extremely well,'' he said. ``He showed a lot of  
poise, a lot of maturity. He made outstanding decisions with the 
football. He threw it out of bounds, avoided sacks and didn't try 
to force things that could have conceivably turned into 
interceptions. He played like we expect him to play for the next 
two years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That could mean an eventual win against the Seminoles.  
</P>
<P>
	But for now, the Hurricanes will have to settle for being  
labeled the best three-loss team in the country, a distinction that 
means little to the players. 
</P>
<P>
	``They only give away consolation prizes in game shows,''  
linebacker Rod Mack said.

<HEADLINE> Grocery Store Chain, Union in Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- A union representing Cincinnati-area workers  
in the nation's largest grocery store chain continued negotiations 
Sunday after calling off a planned strike. 
</P>
<P>
	Kroger Co.'s five-year contract with the United Food and  
Commercial Workers Local 1099 expired at midnight Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Jagers, a spokesman for Cincinnati-based Kroger, confirmed  
Sunday that negotiations were ongoing. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are making progress. But I have no idea when they'll be  
finished,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Union spokesman John Marrone said Saturday that the decision to  
strike would be on a meeting-to-meeting basis. He could not be 
reached for comment Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract being negotiated covers 8,400 employees in Kroger's  
grocery and meat sections in southeastern Indiana and the 
Cincinnati area. Drugstore and general merchandise division 
employees have a separate contract. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Yanks Dominating Like Last October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Since everything else the New York  
Yankees have done this year has been compared to 1998, it's only 
fair to point out these guys were as good if not better in the 
first round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The reigning World Series champions wrapped up their second  
straight first-round sweep of the Texas Rangers with a 3-0 victory 
Saturday night. New York allowed just one run in three games -- just 
like last year -- while scoring five more. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's incredible,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre said. ``Last year  
we did the same thing and I remember saying this was the toughest 
series for us because you don't want to go through this ballclub 
again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Best of all, they did it without playoff ace David Cone breaking  
a sweat. 
</P>
<P>
	Cone, who could use the extra rest, would've started Game 4  
against Texas. Instead, he'll likely pitch the opener of the AL 
championship series Wednesday night at Yankee Stadium against 
either Cleveland or Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're throwing the ball well, and our best money pitcher  
hasn't even come out of the bag yet,'' Game 3 winner Roger Clemens 
said. ``It'll be interesting to see what spark he gives us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York, which has won 10 straight postseason games, has used  
first-round victories over Texas as a springboard to World Series 
titles in 1996 and '98. 
</P>
<P>
	But the hunt for a third title in four years and 25th overall  
carries the added burden of following one of baseball's best teams 
ever. The '98 Yankees won 114 regular-season games and swept San 
Diego in the Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Although this team won 16 fewer games from April to October --  
the biggest falloff in the AL -- it still has a chance for a better 
postseason. Beating last year's 11-2 playoff run won't be easy, but 
sweeping Texas at least makes it possible. 
</P>
<P>
	``You see guys are just determined to get it done, whether it's  
going to get a ball or cut a ball off,'' Clemens said. ``That's 
what these games are about now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York pitchers controlled this series by shutting down Texas  
hitters. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers, who led the majors with a .293 average in the  
regular season, batted just .152, including 0-for-13 with runners 
in scoring position. They were shut out twice in three games after 
being blanked seven times in 162 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Starters Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez, Andy Pettitte and  
Clemens each went at least seven innings, and relievers Jeff Nelson 
and Mariano Rivera did the rest. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they would've shut out any team they faced,''  
shortstop Derek Jeter said. ``They were just on top of their game, 
hitting their spots and not letting anybody get on base.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees led 20 of the 27 innings this series thanks largely  
to improved hitting by Jeter and Bernie Williams. After going 
1-for-20 against Texas last year, the duo went 9-for-22 with six 
RBIs and five runs. 
</P>
<P>
	Both also came through in the field, especially Saturday. Jeter  
made a nice play to get the final out, and Williams chased down the 
three hardest-hit balls by the Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeter and Williams were on base in the first inning when Darryl  
Strawberry drove in the game's only runs with a two-out homer. 
</P>
<P>
	The drive awoke a lifeless New York dugout and left Texas facing  
a deficit it didn't have the confidence to overcome. 
</P>
<P>
	Pitching like a five-time Cy Young Award winner should, Clemens  
made the lead hold up by allowing just three singles in seven 
shutout innings. The Rangers reached second only once, and that 
threat ended on the next pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens' first postseason win since 1986 began making up for a  
mediocre regular season and reminded critical Yankees fans why he 
was acquired from Toronto in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this turns the page on everything that happened this  
year,'' Torre said. ``This is the pitcher we traded for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Almost overshadowed is the dramatic reversal by Strawberry, who  
this time last year only gave New York inspiration as he fought 
colon cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Having beaten the disease and endured another arrest and  
suspension, the king of comebacks said this homer ``probably is at 
the top of the list after all I've been through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great feeling,'' he said. ``This team is always  
accomplishing a lot. We play as a team, as hard as we can and we 
win. I think everybody appreciates what we've done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the Yankees and New York Mets both among the final four  
teams for the first time, the city already is abuzz over the chance 
for a Subway Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry, who has won a World Series with both teams, can only  
imagine the scene. 
</P>
<P>
	``You got to think, `How crazy will it be in New York?' '' he  
said ``As far as the fans and the rivals, Mets fans and Yankees 
fans, you wonder if the city can control that.''

<HEADLINE> Indians Floored in Boston Massacre </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The Indians left Cleveland hoping for a sweep.  
Now, they're just hoping to survive. 
</P>
<P>
	A lost weekend at Fenway Park, capped by a jaw-dropping 23-7  
disaster on Sunday night in Game 4, has set up a decisive fifth 
game in the AL division series at Jacobs Field. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a scenario Cleveland fans couldn't have imagined after the  
Indians won the first two games over the Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	Not when Boston ace Pedro Martinez had a bad back.  
</P>
<P>
	Not when Nomar Garciaparra's injured wrist kept him out of Game  
3. 
</P>
<P>
	Not when the New York Yankees were waiting.  
</P>
<P>
	But a funny thing happened to Cleveland on the way to the AL  
championship series. The Indians failed to put away a reeling 
opponent, and now they're the ones staggering home. 
</P>
<P>
	``All those runs they scored tonight don't mean a thing  
tomorrow,'' catcher Sandy Alomar said. ``It was embarrassing. It 
was humiliating. But we start over 0-0 and forget about it. Tonight 
is over already.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians weren't just beaten. They were knocked flat by the  
kind of offensive assault they're famous for. And even when the Red 
Sox went up by 13 runs after four innings, they didn't let up. 
</P>
<P>
	It was as if they were trying to score enough runs to win both  
Games 4 and 5 at once. 
</P>
<P>
	For a while, the five-time defending AL Central champions looked  
more like the old Indians. The ones who regularly lost 100 games a 
year as baseball's sorriest franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston's fans rubbed it in, too. In the final innings, they  
chanted, ``Man-ny's hitless'' at Indians slugger Manny Ramirez, who 
drove in 165 runs this year but is now 0-for-15 in the series with 
seven strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, they used up all their runs tonight,'' reliever  
Steve Karsay said. ``Everyone in this clubhouse knows we have a 
Game 5 still. We've got Charlie Nagy, a big-game pitcher, out there 
with the ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what happened,'' he said. ``If you would have  
told me this would have happened during the season, I would have 
said, `No way.' Not with the guys we've got.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland manager Mike Hargrove's decision to start ace Bartolo  
Colon in Game 4 on three days' rest backfired miserably. Colon, so 
dominant in Game 1 -- eight innings, 11 strikeouts -- had never 
pitched on such short notice in his career. 
</P>
<P>
	It showed. He only got three outs.  
</P>
<P>
	Colon was wild from the outset. He walked Jose Offerman leading  
off the first before giving up a two-run homer to John Valentin, 
who drove in seven runs. Colon retired the next three batters in 
order, but was battered in the second as the Red Sox held in-game 
batting practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Colon gave up five straight hits, the final one being Jose  
Offerman's two-run homer that made it 7-2 and forced Hargrove to 
start using pitchers he had hoped to save for a possible Game 5. 
</P>
<P>
	Colon walked to the dugout shell-shocked, as were all the  
Indians, who after blowing out Boston 11-1 in Game 2 needed just 
one win to advance to their third straight ALCS and fourth in five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bartolo didn't have his overpowering fastball,'' Alomar said.  
``And he didn't have his breaking ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove said he didn't think the short rest hurt Colon at all.  
</P>
<P>
	``Bartolo's a good competitor,'' Hargrove said. ``He's a strong  
young man. I just think it was one of those nights for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians are now counting on Nagy to get them into the next  
round. Nagy won Game 2, pitching seven strong innings to improve 
his career mark to 10-1 against Boston, including 3-0 in the 
postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove didn't have much choice in starting Colon. He lost Game  
3 starter Dave Burba to injury in the fourth inning on Saturday and 
had to use Jaret Wright in long relief. 
</P>
<P>
	Because Hargrove elected to leave part-time starters Dwight  
Gooden, Mark Langston and Chris Haney off his roster for this 
round, Cleveland was left with a bullpen full of relievers. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be one of several decisions Hargrove is sure to be  
second-guessed over, and one he'll be thinking about on the long 
plane ride home. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything that we threw up there they hit,'' Hargrove said.  
``When it came down, it wasn't where we were standing.''

<HEADLINE> Cigar Craze Over, Analysts Say </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Two years ago, cigars were all the rage.  
</P>
<P>
	Buoyed by glossy magazines touting stogies as an accessory of  
the hip elite, sales skyrocketed. In 1996, sales of premium, 
hand-rolled cigars jumped 67 percent. In 1997, they leapt another 
30 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Cigar night at the Mansion Hill Inn, which boasted the longest  
continuously running cigar night in the country, couldn't compete 
with the dozens of restaurants and bars offering their own 
promotions. 
</P>
<P>
	``EVERYBODY was doing a cigar event,'' Steve Stofelano, Jr. said  
of his restaurant's 1996 decision to stop offering theirs. 
</P>
<P>
	But indications now are that the fad is fading out, and fast.  
</P>
<P>
	Across the Hudson River in Troy, J. Cabrella Inc., a  
two-year-old cigar shop, has filed bankruptcy, citing more than 
$71,000 in obligations to creditors. 
</P>
<P>
	Love of the Leaf, a shop five miles north in Loudonville,  
snuffed its operation months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Clearance deals are the norm at cigar shops across the region.  
</P>
<P>
	And in bars and restaurants, cigar nights aren't the draw they  
once were. Stofelano decided to offer one this past Father's Day. 
It was a wonderful night, he said, but he had to struggle to get 30 
guests. And the ones who came were the old regulars, not the young 
and trendy. 
</P>
<P>
	For them, cigars have come and gone. ``Everybody, if you will,  
has been there, done that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the same story 200 miles west in Rochester, where  
restaurateur Ziad Wehbe isn't bothering to replenish cigar stocks 
at Oasis Mediterranean Bistro. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think anyone cares about them any more,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The ``cigar great awakening'' was bound to crash, said Gerald  
Celente of Trends Research Institute in Rhinebeck, N.Y. The boom 
was marketing-driven, rather than consumer-driven, and reality 
couldn't sustain the imagery. Especially among women. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very unfeminine, and they stink,'' he said. ``Despite all  
the hype and the glossy advertising, women were never going to 
become cigar smokers en masse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And cigar smoking has a heavy ``repulse factor,'' that makes  
cigar smokers a nuisance at parties and restaurants, Celente said. 
</P>
<P>
	For 1999, analysts predict a 10 percent fall in sales of premium  
cigars. Three cigar companies -- JR Cigar, Inc.; General Cigar 
Holdings and Dimon, Inc., showed quarterly revenues down 
significantly from the same period in 1998. Holt's, another cigar 
company, saw its stock rating downgraded by Prudential Bache. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact is there's a limited market out there, and its  
saturated,'' Brown Brothers Harriman Analyst Roy Burry said. 
</P>
<P>
	The cigar business crested in 1964, when Americans were smoking  
9 billion yearly. By 1992, government health warnings had caused 
the industry to fall some 77 percent, to 2.1 billion cigars yearly. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, suddenly, things changed. There was a 14.6 percent jump in  
sales in 1994, followed by a 31 percent rise in 1995. In 1996, 
sales of premium, hand-rolled cigars jumped 67 percent. In 1997, 
they leapt another 30 percent. The Cigar Association of America 
didn't compile figures for 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was seen as one of life's affordable little luxuries, like  
fine wines and single malt scotches,'' Sharp said. 
</P>
<P>
	The soaring economy didn't hurt. Imports poured in from some 18  
countries, and new outlets continued to sprout. Prices climbed. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the newest ones were too late, said Lee Zyniecki.  
Zyniecki, who has owned Edleez Tobacco for 19 years, is somewhat of 
an icon among tobacconists locally and nationally. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will never go back to what it was during the bonanza. All  
these people were gung-ho. Now that's come back down,'' she said. 
What's left are the ones who have been smoking cigars all along, 
and these customers tend to be loyal to vendors who know about the 
business and can obtain good cigars when no one else can. 
</P>
<P>
	``The craze is over,'' said Norman Sharp, president of the Cigar  
Association of America.

<HEADLINE> Ventura OKs Assisted Suicide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura says he  
would want the option of assisted suicide if he were terminally ill 
-- an exception, he says, to his comments in Playboy magazine that 
he has ``no respect for anyone who would kill himself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another exception he makes: if someone were so mentally ill,  
they couldn't judge what they were doing. 
</P>
<P>
	Otherwise, suicide makes no sense because if someone is at the  
point of considering suicide, ``it can only get better,'' Ventura 
said.

<HEADLINE> Hingis Wins Porsche Tennis Tourney </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FILDERSTADT, Germany (AP) -- Top-ranked Martina Hingis captured  
her seventh title of the year and added another Porsche to her car 
collection Sunday when she beat Mary Pierce 6-4, 6-1 in the final 
of the Porsche Grand Prix. 
</P>
<P>
	Hingis also won the $520,000 indoor tournament in 1996, her  
first professional singles title, and in 1997. She needed just 65 
minutes to earn this year's first prize, a convertible. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still have a little place in the garage,'' she said. ``It's  
always special to play here, where I won my first title.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fourth-seeded Pierce has been practicing with Hingis for a  
week but it didn't help her. 
</P>
<P>
	After trading breaks of serve, Pierce dropped her serve again in  
the seventh game and never recovered. 
</P>
<P>
	Under pressure from Hingis, she could not hold serve at the  
start of the second set. She saved three break points in the third 
game but a forehand winner by Hingis made it 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
	Hingis then had to save two break points to hold for 4-0.  
</P>
<P>
	With Pierce serving to stay in the match, Hingis forced her into  
a backhand error that gave Hingis a match point. 
</P>
<P>
	A hard-hitting rally ended with Pierce's forehand sailing wide.  
</P>
<P>
	``All in all, I am happy with the way I played here this week,''  
said Pierce, who won here in 1993 but is still without a title this 
year. She settled for $40,000.

<HEADLINE> Coach: Warrick's Heisman Hopes Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Florida State coach Bobby Bowden feels  
that Peter Warrick's Heisman Trophy hopes are over. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's probably blown,'' Bowden said Sunday after Warrick's  
legal troubles forced him to miss the Seminoles victory over Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	If Warrick returns to the Seminole lineup this season, Bowden  
said he shouldn't worry about any honors. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would tell him to take a very back seat, a very back seat,''  
Bowden said when asked his advice for Warrick. ``You go out there 
and play the best you can play and don't even think about the 
Heisman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick and Georgia Tech quarterback Joe Hamilton had been among  
the leaders in the chase for the Heisman, college football's most 
coveted individual award. 
</P>
<P>
	But Warrick's chances may have disappeared with his arrest last  
week on a grand theft charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick, teammate Laveranues Coles and a Dillard's department  
store clerk were charged Thursday after the clerk allegedly sold 
them $412.38 worth of clothing for $21.40. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles, who already was on probation for other violations of team  
rules, was kicked off the team and Warrick was suspended until his 
legal status is determined. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick was scheduled for an initial court appearance Monday,  
but his attorney, John Kenny, said he has filed a written notice of 
appearance, and neither he nor his client would be in court. 
Normally, a trial would be set at least six weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick apologized for his actions Saturday and then watched his  
teammates defeat Miami, 31-21. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no way we should make a hero out of this thing,''  
Bowden said. Warrick ``needs to sweat a little bit. But again I 
hope he comes back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden expects to hear little from Warrick about his criminal  
case but advised him, ``Don't hide from it. It's there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Bowden said Warrick can make the most of a second chance --  
if he gets one. 
</P>
<P>
	``You go out there and just play the best you can and try to get  
the most out of this year you can get,'' Bowden said.

<HEADLINE> White House Hopefuls Lobby for Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *Associated Press Writer-    	
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The urgent calls to United Food and  
Commercial Workers President Doug Dority came back-to-back -- Vice 
President Al Gore on Friday, Bill Bradley on Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The candidates' personal appeals were, other union officials  
said, pretty typical of the last-minute lobbying over the AFL-CIO 
endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
	Dority's reply to each was just as typical of the dynamic at  
work on the eve of the 13-million-member labor federation's 
biennial convention: I will support Al Gore, but ... 
</P>
<P>
	``An endorsement a couple of months from now may be the most  
impactful way to proceed,'' Greg Denier, Dority's senior assistant, 
said late Saturday. ``It's a matter of practical, political 
consideration that there has to be some consensus building and on 
the question of early endorsement, obviously there's not 
consensus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By Sunday afternoon, after AFL-CIO President John Sweeney  
pressed Gore's case in a private meeting, the UFCW board voted 
unanimously to endorse Gore. Dority, whose union represents 1.4 
million workers, immediately hit the phones to lobby fellow union 
presidents. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore campaign chairman Tony Coelho, arriving in Los Angeles late  
Sunday for last-minute lobbying, found his task suddenly lighter. 
He said the UFCW's turn all but assured Gore the federation's 
endorsement when the executive council and full convention vote 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The UFCW endorsement makes it look very good. Now we just work  
on the rest of them to get them to endorse or abstain,'' Coelho 
said. Remaining holdouts include the United Auto Workers, Teamsters 
and Electrical Workers, labor officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Explaining the UFCW vote, Denier said that the news media had  
driven the stakes so high that his union didn't want a ``no'' vote 
to be misinterpreted ``as weak support for Gore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sounding satisfied, Sweeney said the votes are moving his way.  
``More and more people are realizing that it's really not early,'' 
he told a reporter. 
</P>
<P>
	How did the stakes mount so high? Interviews with several labor  
operatives suggest that Gore, despite a history of regular 
attention to union meetings and conventions, waited too long to 
place his calls to key labor leaders and seal their support. In the 
meantime, Bradley and his top operatives -- campaign manager Gina 
Glantz and strategist Will Robinson, both with their own long, 
professional ties to organized labor -- aggressively worked the 
phones. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley's message -- ``All I'm asking is that you give me some  
time'' before going with Gore -- began to stick among labor leaders 
not necessarily pro-Bradley but committed to letting the decision 
come from members not yet focused on the 2000 election. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that Bradley is closing in on -- or edging ahead of -- Gore in  
the key states of New Hampshire and New York, Gore allies fear 
another delay in the AFL-CIO endorsement that they have sought 
since February would be too big a blow to his already flagging 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Gore wouldn't get it, I think it would be very, very  
harmful to Gore,'' acknowledged Gerald McEntee, president of the 
American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, and 
Gore's chief backer at the convention. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bill Bradley and his folks have worked very hard. If there is  
an endorsement, Bradley is hurt, but not as much,'' McEntee said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sept. 27, both campaigns made separate presentations to the  
AFL-CIO's executive council, the 15 to 20 presidents of the largest 
affiliated unions, in a suite at the Hay-Adams Hotel across from 
the White House. Both camps showed slides of their polling data, 
fund raising, organizational structure and strategies for winning 
both the Democratic nomination as well as the general election. 
</P>
<P>
	One Gore ally present for both sessions, speaking on condition  
of anonymity, called Bradley's presentation ``surprisingly 
credible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Gore's problem, if you were to ask him and he were to be  
honest with you, is that the campaign underestimated how hard this 
(endorsement) would be and sort of took it for granted,'' Teamsters 
political director Michael Mathis said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the week or so leading up to the convention, not only did  
Gore hit the phones, but Coelho enlisted the top Democrat in the 
House, Richard Gephardt of Missouri -- about as pure a labor hero as 
the Democrats have -- to make some calls, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the huge chore of moving Gore's campaign from Washington  
to Tennessee in the space of one week, Coelho and campaign manager 
Donna Brazile flew here. Bradley aides closely monitored the 
back-room wrangling from his New Jersey headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerry Shea, governmental affairs assistant to Sweeney, said Gore  
has gotten a bum rap and, given how hard he has worked -- in the 
White House and in Congress before then -- to advance labor 
interests, should not have been expected to work so hard for an 
endorsement that many view as inevitable still. 
</P>
<P>
	``The union presidents wanted to be asked, every president  
wanted to be called,'' said Shea. ``People were holding him to a 
higher standard.''

<HEADLINE> Papers Show Yanks' Hernandez Older </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Those who were planning to wish New York Yankees  
pitcher Orlando Hernandez a happy 30th birthday this week may be 
too late -- by four years. 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez, whose nickname is ``El Duque,'' has said he was born  
on Oct. 11, 1969. But court documents filed in Havana in connection 
to his divorce say he was born in 1965, New York magazine reports 
in its Oct. 18 issue, on newsstands Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	That would mean Hernandez turns 34 Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	The divorce decree was filed in February 1997. A copy of the  
decree and an English translation recently came to light as part of 
a child-support case brought by Hernandez's ex-wife, Norma. The 
couple's 7 1/2-year marriage ended 10 months before Hernandez fled 
Cuba in December 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez has acknowledged the legitimacy of the decree in court  
papers filed in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	He was 17-9 with a 4.12 ERA this season with the Yankees, and  
was the winning pitcher last Tuesday against the Texas Rangers in 
the opening game of the playoffs.

<HEADLINE> Offense Eyed in Rangers' Elimination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- The Texas Rangers will spend the winter  
facing the bizarre dilemma of trying to fix something they don't 
really think is broken. 
</P>
<P>
	Again.  
</P>
<P>
	For the second straight year, the powerful offense that carried  
the Rangers into the postseason fell asleep in the playoffs. Texas 
scored one run in a three-game sweep by New York, exactly like last 
October. 
</P>
<P>
	``I cannot explain what happened,'' said Rafael Palmeiro, who  
challenged for the Triple Crown all season, then had just three 
singles in the playoffs. ``I'll think about it all winter and maybe 
tell you why in spring training. Right now, it's kind of hard to 
believe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers won 95 games, the most in franchise history, behind  
an offense that averaged 5.83 runs per game and hit a majors-best 
.293. 
</P>
<P>
	In the playoffs, they batted .152 and were shut out twice,  
mainly because they went 0-for-13 with men on second or third. 
Texas' only run came on a solo homer by Juan Gonzalez in Game 2, 
and the Rangers have just two runs in their last 60 innings in the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see this as a step backwards,'' manager Johnny Oates  
said. ``I know that our goal is to move forward and win a world 
championship. I'm confident that it will happen here soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a few months to analyze what went on this playoff and  
see how we can score. It seems like we had no problem scoring most 
of the year, yet come these three games we can't smell home 
plate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pitching and defense, the usual cornerstones for success in  
baseball, have never been Texas traditions. Bashing baseballs has 
always been the Rangers style, for better or worse -- mostly worse. 
</P>
<P>
	But in 1996, they slugged their way to their first division  
title and even won their first playoff game. Three years and two 
division titles later, Texas still has just one postseason win. 
</P>
<P>
	The 3-0 loss Saturday night was the Rangers' ninth straight in  
the playoffs against the Yankees. Even though New York went on to 
win the World Series in '96 and '98, that's of little consolation. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are certain teams throughout history in all sports that  
have a nemesis,'' shortstop Royce Clayton said. ``They happen to be 
ours.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The same old, same old is hurting the Rangers off the field,  
too. 
</P>
<P>
	Attendance this season was down from last year, with fewer than  
40,000 fans attending crucial games in late September. Although the 
playoff game sold out, ticket sales went very slowly. And 
television ratings for the two road games were down 19 percent from 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Owner Tom Hicks isn't the kind of guy to let things fall into a  
rut. 
</P>
<P>
	Hicks -- who is merging the Rangers' front office with the  
business side of his Stanley Cup champion hockey team, the Dallas 
Stars -- said in the spring that Oates and general manager Doug 
Melvin would be held accountable if Texas flopped again in the 
first round. 
</P>
<P>
	Their jobs are likely safe, though, considering Hicks gave them  
contract extensions a few weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	First, they'll have to decide whether to re-sign their own  
potential free agents: lineup regulars Todd Zeile, Mark McLemore 
and Tom Goodwin, plus Aaron Sele, their winningest pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodwin is the most likely to go because the Rangers may need  
his outfield spot for Ruben Mateo, their best prospect since 
Gonzalez. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Rangers do make a major shakeup, it could be Mateo  
replacing Gonzalez, who is facing a club option for 2000. Melvin 
may be more willing than ever to listen to trade offers for the 
two-time AL MVP. 
</P>
<P>
	A more likely move is the signing of a free agent pitcher, the  
top candidate being Kenny Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas has lacked a left-hander in the rotation since he left.  
Rogers remains close friends with Palmeiro, and his successful 
return after five seasons in Baltimore may convince Rogers to come 
back to his original team. 
</P>
<P>
	How much more money Hicks is willing to put towards the Rangers  
could determine their offseason moves. Texas began the season with 
a $74.9 million payroll, baseball's fourth-highest. 
</P>
<P>
	``He deserves better than what we've put out so far,'' Clayton  
said. ``I just hope he gives us a chance. Knowing his desire to 
win, I don't think he's going to let this ballclub dissolve.''

<HEADLINE> Cowboys' Irvin Injured, Leaves Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Dallas Cowboys receiver Michael Irvin was  
taken off the field on a stretcher Sunday after getting hit on the 
head in the first quarter against Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvin caught a short pass from Troy Aikman, tried to shake a  
tackle from Bobby Taylor and was hit on the head by safety Tim 
Hauck as he hit the ground. As Taylor tackled Irvin, Hauck's 
shoulder pad collided with the side of Irvin's helmet, twisting his 
head awkwardly as it hit the artificial turf. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cowboys said Irvin sustained trauma to the head and neck and  
had movement in his extremities. He was taken by ambulance to the 
spinal unit of a hospital. Team owner Jerry Jones accompanied Irvin 
in the ambulance. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvin moved his fingers and appeared to be talking as he lay on  
his back for more than 10 minutes. He was fitted with a neck brace 
and loaded onto a stretcher as his teammates circled in prayer 
across the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Incredibly, the fans at Veterans Stadium cheered when they first  
realized Irvin was down. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Cowboys' prayer group broke up, Deion Sanders  
nervously circled his fallen teammate while medical staff attended 
to him. Emmitt Smith and Erik Williams stood closest to Irvin. 
After several minutes, Jones came down on the field and walked 
toward the ambulance as Irvin was loaded into the back and driven 
away.

<HEADLINE> First Lady: End Trafficking of Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	REYKJAVIK, Iceland (AP) -- First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton  
issued a call to end the international trade in prostitution on 
Sunday during her last stop in a weeklong European tour. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking at a conference on women and democracy in Iceland's  
capital, she decried a system that allows girls to be lured from 
home with the promise of jobs, ``trafficked like drugs across state 
lines and sold into prostitution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We are working to stop trafficking of women and girls in this  
region and around the world,'' she said. ``No government and no 
citizen can rest until we stop this modern form of slavery, protect 
its victims and prosecute those who are responsible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The speech was her most outspoken of the tour, which also took  
her to Italy, Slovakia and Poland. Although she is a likely 
candidate for a U.S. Senate seat from New York in next year's 
elections, Mrs. Clinton has generally avoided directly commenting 
on U.S. political issues during the trip. The White House says the 
trip is not linked to domestic politics. 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of her address, more than 300 delegates gave Mrs.  
Clinton a standing ovation. They included representatives from the 
United States, Russia, the Nordic countries, Latvia, Lithuania and 
Estonia. 
</P>
<P>
	Since arriving in Iceland on Friday night, Mrs. Clinton has met  
with President Olafur Ragnar Grimsson and visited the U.S.-Iceland 
Defense Force at its Keflavik Base. About 2,500 U.S. troops are 
stationed at the NATO base under the terms of a 1951 defense 
agreement between the two nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Poor weather prevented her from visiting the Westman Islands on  
Saturday, so Prime Minister David Oddson instead took her on a tour 
of downtown Reykjavik. Later, she saw the ``Islendigur,'' the ship 
that will sail to North America next year to commemorate explorer 
Leif Ericsson's voyage to the continent in the year 1000. 
</P>
<P>
	She also toured the country's Thingvellir National Park and was  
presented with two Icelandic horses, which are to be given to an 
American school.

<HEADLINE> Surprise Starts Dot NHL Landscape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Vancouver Canucks are playing like they're trying to make up  
for the last few years. Same for the San Jose Sharks and Florida 
Panthers. 
</P>
<P>
	Topped by the Canucks' 3-0 record, those three are among the  
team surprises after the first week of the NHL season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's time to get a little bit excited,'' coach Mark Crawford  
said after Vancouver's 4-1 win over Montreal on Saturday night gave 
the Canucks their best start since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to get carried away with ourselves. We know  
we've got a long way to go. ... But right now, the confidence can 
keep building for us if we continue to adhere to what we're 
doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Canucks have reason to feel good about themselves these  
days. They've missed the playoffs for three straight years and have 
been at the bottom of the Western Conference two seasons in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	Their 3-0 start is one win short of their best in franchise  
history. The Canucks' three-game winning streak is also their 
longest since February 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's only three games in, but we've been playing really hard.  
We've bought into a system and we've got to keep on riding it,'' 
Todd Bertuzzi said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sharks and Panthers both feel pretty good, too, after strong  
starts. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sharks began the season with three straight victories for  
the first time in their history before losing 3-2 to defending 
Stanley Cup champion Dallas on Saturday night. The Panthers are 
2-0-1 after Saturday night's 2-2 tie with the Detroit Red Wings. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sharks, who finished seventh in the Western Conference last  
year, have never had a winning season in their eight years in the 
NHL. The Panthers, Stanley Cup finalists in 1996, have missed the 
playoffs for two straight seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday night's performance was a gutsy effort by the Panthers,  
who rallied from a 2-0 deficit to tie one of the NHL's tougher 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``Getting down 2-0 to one of the premier teams in the league and  
certainly one of the best defensive teams, I'm very happy to come 
back and tie this thing,'' Panthers coach Terry Murray said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles Kings are another team trying to forget the  
past, and doing a pretty good job of it. They're at 3-1-1 in the 
midst of a seven-game road trip to start the season, including a 
2-2 tie Saturday night at Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kings missed the playoffs last season for the fifth time in  
six years, including last year when they went 32-45-5. 
</P>
<P>
	``We talked about calling this a good trip if we won tonight,''  
said Kings coach Andy Murray. ``Now it goes a step below a great 
trip but a few steps above a good trip.''

<HEADLINE> Buchanan May Jump to Reform Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- If presidential hopeful Pat Buchanan  
jumps to the Reform Party, he is likely to bring with him a legion 
of supporters who could substantially change the face of the party, 
political analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
	The question for Reformers is whether that influx will make them  
more competitive with the two established parties or make them 
look, as one observer suggests, like ``cranks and malcontents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan is widely expected to announce by month's end that he  
is bolting the Republican Party to seek the Reform presidential 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Some say the commentator would energize the party, bring in new  
members and create a lively contest. Others say his strongly 
conservative views on social issues would turn off voters and make 
it difficult to recruit candidates even as his supporters seize 
control of the party. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven Schier, a political science professor at Carleton College  
in Northfield, Minn., said Buchanan and his followers would bring 
organization to a party with roots in Texas billionaire Ross 
Perot's 1992 presidential bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan also might get the 5 percent of the vote necessary for  
the party to keep its federal campaign funds, which total $12.6 
million for the 2000 presidential race. 
</P>
<P>
	But Schier argued that Buchanan also would narrow the party's  
appeal and make it ``look like a refuge for cranks and 
malcontents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan and his staff declined to comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota's Reform governor, Jesse Ventura, would prefer another  
candidate, possibly former Connecticut Gov. Lowell Weicker or New 
York developer Donald Trump. 
</P>
<P>
	Trump is forming a committee to explore a run and had a dinner  
meeting with Ventura. Weicker balked at seeking a spot on the 
ticket. 
</P>
<P>
	Dean Barkley, a former Reform Senate candidate who advised  
Ventura in the 1998 campaign, was of two minds about a Buchanan 
candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no doubt this is going to bring more attention and  
energy to our presidential contest than I could dream of, 
especially if it gets into an honest contest between two players,'' 
said Barkley, a member of Ventura's Cabinet as director of the 
state planning agency. 
</P>
<P>
	But if Buchanan joins the party and doesn't play down his  
conservative social views, ``it becomes very problematic,'' Barkley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reform Party, although sharing many of Buchanan's economic  
stands, has been largely libertarian on abortion, gay rights and 
other social issues that have animated him in three presidential 
campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, Ventura referred Sunday to those stands in questioning  
whether he could support Buchanan's candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very different on social issues,'' Ventura said on ABC's  
``This Week.'' ``Mr. Buchanan likes to put social issues to the 
forefront. We in the Reform Party traditionally have never done 
that, and I agree with that. I don't like putting social issues out 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his new book, Buchanan raises questions about the U.S. entry  
into the war against Nazi Germany, saying the Third Reich was no 
threat to the United States after 1940. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew Research Center for the People  
and the Press, said Buchanan's candidacy probably would not improve 
the image of the Reform Party. 
</P>
<P>
	In a Pew poll before the book's release, 7 percent said there  
was a good chance they would vote for Buchanan. Twenty-five percent 
said there was some chance and 63 percent said there was no way 
they would vote for Buchanan. 
</P>
<P>
	Pat Choate, who was Perot's vice presidential running mate, is  
urging Buchanan to join the Reformers, saying he would draw 
millions of voters by focusing on the economy and foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Buchanan above and beyond that is feisty, he's a fantastic  
debater and in the minds of the American public he will give the 
Reform Party equal status with the Democrats and Republicans,'' 
Choate said. 
</P>
<P>
	Party chairman Russell Verney, who is close to Perot, said that  
even if Buchanan brings supporters, he won't overwhelm the party. 
</P>
<P>
	``It isn't as though somebody, and I don't care if they have the  
4th Armored Division with them, can come in and take over the 
party,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	There already are signs that some are unhappy with Buchanan. The  
New Hampshire Reform Party canceled a meeting because of an 
expected flood of Buchanan supporters seeking to become delegates. 
</P>
<P>
	Anyone who requests a ballot can vote in the party's primary. It  
would take a two-thirds vote of national convention delegates to 
set aside the ballot decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Incoming party chairman Jack Gargan is concerned that if  
Buchanan gets enough delegates to next summer's convention in Long 
Beach, Calif., he will be able to overturn a nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he will be a strong candidate, but I certainly want to  
see three or four others,'' Gargan said. He also wants to change 
the convention rules when he takes office in January.

<HEADLINE> Doctor Starts Work at 55 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Dr. Robert Lopatin's prescription for a  
fulfilling, no-regrets life: Don't be afraid of change, and never 
pass up an opportunity to try something new. 
</P>
<P>
	He's taken a healthy dose of his own medicine. At 55, Lopatin is  
fresh out of medical school, one of the oldest first-year residents 
in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	He works 100-hour weeks, including exhausting overnight calls,  
alongside colleagues young enough to be his children, while 
physicians his own age may ponder retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	Why bother?  
</P>
<P>
	Lopatin dreamed as a boy of becoming a doctor, but put his  
interest in medicine aside during college and eventually went into 
business with his father. The two ran a women's clothing company 
for 27 years. A year or so after they sold it in the early 1990s, 
Lopatin decided it wasn't too late to fulfill his longtime dream. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like nirvana,'' he said. ``I feel like I died and was  
born again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When, at age 51, he began studying at the Albert Einstein  
College of Medicine, he was older than most of his professors -- 
even older than the school itself. But he felt completely at home. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just thrilling, this feeling of picking up the pieces  
of something one had left aside,'' he recalled. ``I felt somewhat 
out of place as an older person, but as a student I felt absolutely 
in my element.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now half a year out of med school, Lopatin has just started a  
four-year residency at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx. A 
bachelor, he has moved out of his Manhattan apartment to live 
closer to the hospital and says it's hard to find time for friends 
and family. 
</P>
<P>
	But he wouldn't have it any other way.  
</P>
<P>
	``When you're older, once you do make a commitment to something  
... there's more purposefulness,'' he said. ``Things stay more in 
perspective.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lopatin admits the hours are tough. Six-thirty a.m. to midnight  
workdays are common, and graveyard shifts are required four times a 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	But he believes his maturity helps him practice better medicine,  
and colleagues and patients agree. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a fabulous intern because he has a true devotion to what  
he's doing,'' says his supervisor, Dr. Lawrence Brandt. ``Being 
older, he sees things from a different perspective. ... Patients 
immediately latch onto his positive qualities and see someone who 
they can trust.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ramona Cosme, 86, was treated recently by Lopatin and said she  
felt more comfortable with him than she would with a twenty- or 
thirty-something doctor. 
</P>
<P>
	``He really worries about the patients,'' she said in Spanish.  
``A person of a certain age has already gone through experiences of 
life ... and had a chance to reflect upon them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lopatin's late leap to medicine was completely in character for  
a man whose life has been a continuous quest for education. 
</P>
<P>
	After long days working as a garment industry executive, he  
studied art history at Columbia University at night, completing all 
the requirements for a Ph.D. except his dissertation. He studied 
clothing production at the Fashion Institute of Technology and took 
classes in Spanish, French, Italian, German and Yiddish. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never been out of school,'' he explained. ``It just makes  
me feel alive; that's who I am.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When he left the garment industry in 1991, he headed straight  
for the classroom, though medicine wasn't yet on his mind. He 
studied Shakespeare and Latin, took calculus, enrolled in a U.N. 
training program for Spanish language interpreters. 
</P>
<P>
	Still intrigued by art history, he joined an archeological dig  
in Belgium in 1992. At a friend's wedding in Zurich, he happened to 
sit near a young man who'd just finished medical school. Talking 
with him reminded Lopatin of his own boyhood dream. 
</P>
<P>
	``How many times is a person ... genuinely free to be able to  
restart their life?'' he asked. ``I said to myself, 'I have to at 
least pursue it ... because if I don't I will be forever filled 
with self-reproach. I will have failed myself.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Lopatin entered a New York University pre-med program and was  
soon taking classes in biology, chemistry and physics. 
</P>
<P>
	He knew right away he'd made a good choice.  
</P>
<P>
	``It took a lot of ... imagination to do it, to get myself to do  
it, but once I undertook it, it just felt so right,'' he said. ``I 
felt I was home again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So what comes next?  
</P>
<P>
	Even now, Lopatin doesn't expect his career path to be straight.  
He says he might like to study for a master's degree in public 
health and get involved in international health care policy. 
</P>
<P>
	One thing's for sure: ``I'll die a doctor, whenever that  
comes.''

<HEADLINE> US Gymnasts Barely Make Medal Round </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TIANJIN, China (AP) -- A recurring bar problem nearly cost  
America's women gymnasts a chance at a World Championships medal. 
</P>
<P>
	Not even aware of their perilous position, Vanessa Atler, the  
last American to compete, clinched a place for the United States in 
the six-team medal round with a 9.762 Sunday in the floor 
exercises. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the fifth best score of the qualifying round in that  
event, and was enough to lift the Americans into fifth place, 
behind defending champion Romania, Russia, Ukraine and China. They 
also were safely into the top 12 that qualify for next year's 
Olympics in Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, it was the 17-year-old Atler who had problems on the  
uneven bars. Falls in that event cost her the national championship 
this year and last. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, she made no mistake, scoring 9.475, while U.S.  
champion Kristen Maloney faltered, falling the wrong way out of a 
handstand. The mistake wasn't apparent to the audience, but she 
scored only 8.975. 
</P>
<P>
	In the same event, Jamie Dantzscher managed only 8.312 as she  
lost her grip on the lower bar at one point. Elise Ray recouped 
vital points with a .600, and later contributed 9.612 in the floor 
exercises. 
</P>
<P>
	Maloney and Atler both scored 9.612 on the balance beam, and  
Maloney had 9.750 on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's competition ``just got all the jitters out,'' said the  
17-year-old Atler, who stood seventh in the individual standings 
with 38.367. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're all really inexperienced, we were all really nervous,''  
Atler said. ``Now that we've got it done, and we know what it's 
like, we can just go out there and have fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Atler said she wasn't aware of the importance of her final floor  
exercise, and Maloney added: ``We didn't really look at the 
scoreboard. We wanted to focus on our routines.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I always get a little nervous, especially being second to the  
last and last on every event. ... But I know I can hit for our 
team,'' Maloney said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the four best scores from five gymnasts in each event  
count toward the total, Atler's 7.762 on the floor made a 
difference of 0.625 to the U.S. score, which was just 0.313 ahead 
of sixth-place Australia and 0.594 better than non-qualifier Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	The medal round comes Tuesday, and coach Kelly Hill said, ``We  
have time now to work out the glitches and we will be fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joining Atler in the 36 who will compete for the individual  
all-around title were Ray, 12th in qualifying with 37.848, and 
Maloney, 16th with 37.768. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. women's team finished sixth in the last World  
Championships in 1997, down sharply from its 1996 Olympic gold 
medal. 
</P>
<P>
	It is competing without Jennie Thompson, third placer in the  
U.S. championships. She reinjured her left ankle in practice here, 
and was replaced by 16-year-old Morgan White. 
</P>
<P>
	In men's qualifying, three-time defending champion China made a  
strong start, leading with 230.546 points to 224.322 for Ukraine, 
224.245 for Germany and 223.733 for Spain after 17 of the 47 teams 
had competed. 
</P>
<P>
	Strong rivals including Russia, Belarus, the United States and  
Japan were not scheduled to compete until Monday.

<HEADLINE> Local Votes Boost Social Democrats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's Social Democrats  
recovered from a string of losses and held their own in local 
elections in Berlin on Sunday, according to television exit polls. 
</P>
<P>
	The conservative Christian Democrats, led by Berlin mayor  
Eberhard Diepgen, posted gains in the German capital and remained 
the dominant party in local government, the exit polls showed. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Social Democrats held on to second place with 23  
percent, virtually unchanged from the last Berlin election four 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The results of the last major electoral test this year were  
shaping up as a relief for Schroeder, whose popularity has slid 
since he introduced an austerity budget that would cut cherished 
social programs. 
</P>
<P>
	He has insisted that the changes -- including cuts in jobless and  
welfare benefits -- are needed to bring down the national debt and 
secure Germany's economic health. 
</P>
<P>
	The former East German communists, apparently picking up leftist  
voters upset by the Social Democrats' move toward the political 
center, won 17.5 percent, a gain of about three percentage points, 
the exit polls showed. 
</P>
<P>
	The environmentalist Greens, Schroeder's junior partner in the  
year-old federal coalition, were at 10.5 percent, down from 13 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Schroeder had declared Berlin, with its 2.4 million eligible  
voters, a national test. At his party's final campaign rally Friday 
night, he said a strong result for the Social Democrats was 
``important not just for this city, but important for the entire 
country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The results indicated that Diepgen, lacking an outright  
majority, would continue his 8-year-old coalition with the Social 
Democrats as junior partner. 
</P>
<P>
	Significantly for Schroeder, that would keep Berlin's four seats  
in the 69-seat upper house of parliament from shifting to the 
conservative opposition, avoiding fresh legislative obstacles for 
the government's plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the Social Democrats lost in four state elections  
and in local balloting in North Rhine-Westphalia, which includes 
the Ruhr valley industrial heartland, one of the party's oldest 
strongholds.

<HEADLINE> Planes Prepare for Antarctic Rescue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) -- Two U.S. Hercules LC-130 cargo  
planes, equipped for a perilous landing at the Antarctic, arrived 
in New Zealand on Sunday to prepare to rescue a polar research 
station's American doctor with a lump in her breast. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Air National Guard planes arrived in Christchurch,  
the gateway to the Antarctic for nations carrying out research 
projects on the polar ice. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Jerri Nielsen is the only physician for a crew of 41  
researchers at the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station. She has been 
treating herself with chemotherapy since mid-July, when drugs and 
medical equipment were air-dropped during a howling snowstorm. 
</P>
<P>
	The two Hercules planes, manned by three crews, will remain in  
Christchurch until Tuesday before flying south to the McMurdo 
station on the Antarctic coast, where they will wait for the 
temperature to rise above minus 58 degrees before one of them 
attempts the risky 1,600-mile round trip to rescue Nielsen. 
</P>
<P>
	Temperatures are already rising and the wait is not expected to  
be long. Polar darkness and extreme cold means people do not leave 
the South Pole from February through October. 
</P>
<P>
	A replacement doctor for the station and a team of medics to  
treat Nielsen are on one of the planes, which have skis to allow 
them to land on the ice at Amundsen-Scott base. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane that flies there won't stay any longer than absolutely  
necessary in the fast-changing and hostile Antarctic weather. 
</P>
<P>
	``They will have a half-hour on the ground -- if that -- then  
they'll be out of there,'' said Arthur Brown, a spokesman for the 
National Science Foundation, which runs the base. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers at the South Pole are studying climate changes,  
astronomy and ozone hole depletion. 
</P>
<P>
	The five-day trip to New Zealand started last Wednesday in New  
York. The planes hopped from one U.S. air base to another, 
refueling along the way. Two planes made the trip in case one 
suffers mechanical problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The LC-130s' crews are New York Air National Guard members who  
specialize in flying and landing in Antarctica, making about 270 
missions each season.

<HEADLINE> Trophy Last Thing on Hamilton's Mind </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The Heisman Trophy was the last thing on Joe  
Hamilton's mind. 
</P>
<P>
	The Georgia Tech senior quarterback was struggling through his  
worst game of the season, committing four turnovers. But then he 
led a last-minute drive to tie the game and scored on a 6-yard run 
in overtime to beat North Carolina 31-24 on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Heisman?  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not concerned with it. That's a postseason award. All  
we're doing now is looking forward to winning the rest of the 
season,'' Hamilton said. ``I had a tough game, but that's why it's 
a team game. I don't win by myself and I don't lose by myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton, who has guided the Yellow Jackets high-powered offense  
that averages 41 points and 515.8 yards per game, made it happen 
when it counted. 
</P>
<P>
	Tech moved to 4-1 overall, 2-1 in the Atlantic Coast Conference.  
However, the Yellow Jackets fell one spot to No. 8 with the narrow 
victory over the Tar Heels (1-4, 0-4 ACC). 
</P>
<P>
	With 1:10 left and the Yellow Jackets trailing 24-21 in  
regulation, Tech took over on its own 2-yard line and no time outs 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton completed 3-of-4 passes for 73 yards, including two of  
32 and 35 yards to Kelly Campbell, and ran six yards to the Tar 
Heels 19 with eight seconds left in regulation. 
</P>
<P>
	Freshman Luke Manget, who had missed two earlier field goals of  
40 yards and 39 yards, came on and hit a 36-yarder to tie it with 
five seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I caught it a little high. I was loooking up and  
praying that it wasn't going to get blocked,'' said Manget. 
</P>
<P>
	In overtime, Tech took over on the Tar Heels 25 and kept it on  
the ground. Phillip Rogers ran twice for 11 yards and Hamilton 
twice for 14, the last a six-yard quarterback draw for the lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Then Tech's defense took over, stopping the Tar Heels on four  
plays for the win. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton completed 14-of-26 pass attempts for 273 yards and two  
touchdowns, but had two interceptions. He also ran for 77 yards on 
14 carries, but had two fumbles. 
</P>
<P>
	For the season, Hamilton has completed 79 of 117 passing  
attempts for 1,347 yards and 12 TDs with four interceptions. He's 
rushed 68 times for 321 yards and another six scores. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Hamilton's game was his worst of the year, it went much  
better than his counterpart. The Tar Heels lost starting 
quarterback Ronald Curry for the season in the second quarter with 
a torn Achilles. 
</P>
<P>
	Curry scored on a 30-yard scamper before he was injured.  
</P>
<P>
	Tech, held scoreless for the first time all season in the  
opening quarter, fell behind 13-0 before Hamilton connected on the 
47-yard scoring bomb with Campbell 49 seconds before halftime. 
</P>
<P>
	The duo gave the Yellow Jackets their first lead on their first  
possession of the second half on a 59-yard TD strike.

<HEADLINE> NFL Injury Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Dallas receiver Michael Irvin injured his neck and spinal cord  
in Philadelphia on Sunday and was carried off the field in a 
stretcher, but he was able to move his hands and feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvin was taken to a hospital, where tests showed swelling in  
the spinal cord and a herniated disc. 
</P>
<P>
	Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, who rode in the ambulance with Irvin,  
refused to speculate about the seriousness of the injury. The 
hospital didn't release any information. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt that he needed me, because I knew his family would want  
me to be there to give them information,'' Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another star receiver, Denver's Shannon Sharpe, broke his left  
collarbone against Oakland. It wasn't immediately known how long 
Sharpe would be sidelined. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvin caught a short pass from Troy Aikman in the first quarter,  
tried to shake a tackle from Bobby Taylor and was hit on the head 
by safety Tim Hauck. As Taylor tackled Irvin, Hauck's shoulder pad 
collided with the side of Irvin's helmet, twisting his head 
awkwardly as it hit the artificial turf. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvin was scheduled to spend the night in the hospital, then  
return to Dallas on Jones' jet as early as Monday. Cowboys doctor 
Robert Vandermeer said the herniated disc probably was an old 
injury that wasn't caused by the collision. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvin moved his fingers and appeared to be talking as he lay on  
his back for more than 10 minutes. He was fitted with a neck brace 
and loaded onto a stretcher as his teammates circled in prayer 
across the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Many fans at Veterans Stadium cheered when they realized Irvin  
was down. Players on both sides said they were disgusted. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know our fans pride themselves on being tough, but that  
wasn't tough,'' Eagles receiver Charles Johnson said. ``That was 
just plain ignorant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas' Emmitt Smith said: ``It disgusted me to death. This is  
just a game. Life, paralyzation and death are a reality. Sport is 
sport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Eagles went on to beat the Cowboys 13-10.  
</P>
<P>
	Sharpe was injured in the third quarter against the Raiders,  
adding to the Broncos' long list of serious injuries this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharpe, who has gone to seven consecutive Pro Bowls and is tied  
for first among NFL tight ends with three 1,000-yard receiving 
seasons, was hit by two defenders and landed hard as he attempted 
to catch a pass from Brian Griese. 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos already are missing running back Terrell Davis and  
linebacker John Mobley for the season. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Louis running back Marshall Faulk injured a hip in the first  
quarter of the Rams' 42-20 victory over San Francisco. He returned 
later, but had just 6 yards on seven carries. 
</P>
<P>
	In the same game, 49ers defensive lineman Marvin Washington was  
knocked out for the season with a ruptured quadriceps tendon. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago quarterback Shane Matthews played well in the Bears'  
24-22 victory over Minnesota before pulling his right hamstring 
while scrambling early in the fourth quarter. He completed 19 of 28 
passes for 184 yards, two TDs and no interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	New Orleans quarterback Billy Joe Hobert missed most of Sunday's  
20-17 loss to the Atlanta Falcons after getting a neck stinger on a 
second-quarter sack, the same injury he suffered a week earlier in 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike last week, when Hobert was carted off, he walked off the  
field Sunday after remaining down for several minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	The battered Detroit defense got more bad news during a 20-10  
loss to San Diego. Starting middle linebacker Stephen Boyd left the 
game with a strained arch, defensive tackle Luther Elliss strained 
his groin and backup linebacker Andre Collins sprained an ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	Baltimore managed just 246 yards in offense in a 14-11 loss to  
Tennessee as Pro Bowl left tackle Jonathan Ogden missed most of the 
game after straining his neck.

<HEADLINE> Handheld Devices Spur Internet Boom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- The boom of the Internet will be further fueled by  
newer, cheaper browsing devices appearing on the market as well as 
by industry investments that will greatly expand transmission 
capacity, government and business leaders said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Wu Jichuan, Chinese minister of information industry, told the  
global meeting that China had made great strides in expanding its 
telecommunications networks, but that much work remains to be done 
to give more Chinese access to the Internet and other services. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nearly a quarter of administrative villages have no access to  
telephone service yet,'' Wu said. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry leaders at the United Nations-sponsored Telecom 99, the  
biggest gathering yet of information technology industries, noted 
that products such as the new WAP-based mobile phone may be part of 
the solution for China and other developing countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The cellular phone, using the ``Wireless Application Protocol,''  
allows the user to see information from the World Wide Web in the 
phone's small display window. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM chief executive officer Louis Gerstner said the new devices  
and other handheld ``networked'' products -- personal digital 
assistants and pagers -- were helping to shift the focus from the 
personal computers made by IBM and others. 
</P>
<P>
	``The PC itself isn't dead, but it's no longer occupying center  
stage,'' Gerstner said. 
</P>
<P>
	He noted predictions that there will be 600 million PCs in the  
world by 2003, but said they would be joined by more than 2 billion 
handheld devices and many billions of cars, TVs, tools, appliances 
and vending machines all on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``In short, we're seeing a proliferation of millions and  
millions of new -- and much lower-cost, much easier to use -- access 
points, putting the Net within reach of masses of people who could 
never afford a PC,'' Gerstner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Senior officials of the Finnish cellphone manufacturer Nokia  
Corp. told reporters their new WAP-based mobile 7110 handset should 
be available to some consumers in Europe within the next few weeks. 
It is expected to launched in the United States next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Another manufacturer, Alcatel, is planning to market a WAP-based  
mobile phone in mid-October. 
</P>
<P>
	Volker Jung, a member of the managing board of Siemens AG, said  
his company will be pushing to increase its share of the world 
mobile phone market and would be adding WAP-based services. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerstner said another change will be wrought by ``the gazillions  
of dollars of investment'' in increased ``broadband,'' or 
high-speed, transmission facilities that will speed access to the 
World Wide-Web. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerstner said other industry leaders he talks to know that  
``bandwidth will be nearly as plentiful as sugar or pork bellies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Roth, chief of Nortel Networks, said a just-released study  
sponsored by his company forecast ``an explosion of bandwith in 
Western Europe -- with Internet users rising from 38 million today 
to 150 million by 2005.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That won't be a minute too soon in terms of time wasted waiting  
for Web connections, Roth said. ``An estimated 2.5 billion hours 
were wasted in 1998 while people waited for Web pages to 
download.''

	TIANJIN, China (AP) -- The United States needed Vanessa Atler's  
final 9.762 in floor exercises Sunday to advance to the medal round 
of the World Gymnastics Championships. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Flyers' Center Frustrated by Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Philadelphia Flyers center Rod Brind'Amour  
was depressed and frustrated Sunday while in rehabilitation after a 
second hairline fracture was found in his left foot. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I was a day or two away from maybe getting a really  
good practice in, then I find out it's rebroke ... worse than it 
was originally. Now, I'm basically starting all over,'' Brind'Amour 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's real frustrating and depressing watching the team on TV  
and you're not even a part of it being out like this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brind'Amour is expected to be out 3-6 weeks with the second  
fracture, which was discovered in an X-ray at Pennsylvania Hospital 
on Thursday while doctors were checking the recovery of his first 
fracture from a September game. 
</P>
<P>
	Brind'Amour skated in practice Wednesday and thought he was  
getting better. 
</P>
<P>
	``It didn't feel very good, but I just didn't know how much pain  
I was supposed to skate with. I've had other injuries and played 
through them,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, Brind'Amour continued his weight training and  
cardiovascular workouts on a stationary bike with a cast on his 
foot, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He sustained the first hairline fracture on Sept. 25 during the  
opening period of the Flyers' 4-2 exhibition loss at New Jersey. He 
was placed on injured reserve Oct. 2, ending the longest 
consecutive-game streak in the NHL.

</P>
<P>
	BLOOMINGTON, Ill. (AP) -- State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance  
Co., which has long prided itself on customer service, is now in a 
battle to maintain its reputation. 
</P>
<P>
	The insurance company's image took a hit last week when an  
Illinois jury decided the company required the use of inferior auto 
body parts to repair its customers' cars. 
</P>
<P>
	The company acted quickly by announcing it will temporarily  
suspend use of aftermarket auto parts -- which are modeled on 
manufacturers' parts but made without access to factory 
specifications. 
</P>
<P>
	State Farm also had to reassure its employees of the 70-year-old  
company's good intentions. That job fell to Chairman and CEO Edward 
B. Rust, who asserted firmly the insurer is an honest one. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let me assure you of something you already know,'' he said  
Friday in speech to managers at the company's Bloomington 
headquarters beamed by satellite to 120 other locations. ``Our 
company did not commit fraud. It's our policy to make sure our 
customers understand that we spify generic parts and that we 
guarantee them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rust spoke only hours before a judge awarded $730 million to  
State Farm policyholders in a class-action lawsuit over the use of 
generic replacement parts in auto-body repairs. Williamson County 
Circuit Judge John Speroni's award was on top of a $456 million 
jury award believed to be the largest ever against an insurance 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics say aftermarket parts are not as good as those made for  
automakers. The lawsuit accused State Farm executives of concealing 
that information while flooding customers with brochures promoting 
the parts as a high-quality, low-cost alternative. 
</P>
<P>
	State Farm is the fifth-largest insurer in the country, with  
$24.2 billion in assets. 
</P>
<P>
	In his talk to managers, Rust recounted how years ago the  
company discovered repair shops were using generic parts in place 
of brand name parts to repair claimants' autos. He said the company 
took action in 1987 to assure policyholders were not getting 
cheated. 
</P>
<P>
	``We took the lead in establishing an organization that would  
test parts and certify them if they meet quality standards at least 
as good as the brand name parts,'' he said. ``That organization is 
CAPA, the Certified Auto Parts Association. It exists today, and 
CAPA-certified parts are specified on our repair estimates.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rust's pep talk helped ease the concern of at least one of the  
company's 76,500 employees nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we are all concerned about the fact that it (the  
jury's decision) makes us look like maybe we are not doing 
something that's appropriate when really we are,'' said Peggy 
Burton, a supervisor at the company's Bloomington headquarters. ``I 
think its reassuring to hear him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One consumer advocate said any reaction by consumers against  
State Farm would be misplaced. 
</P>
<P>
	Clarence Ditlow, executive director of the Center for Auto  
Safety, a brainchild of consumer advocate Ralph Nader, said State 
Farm deserves credit for its use of generic parts and making 
certain they are of high quality. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the early days the parts weren't very good,'' Ditlow said.  
``Today they are a whole lot better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ditlow said his organization is on the side of State Farm on the  
issue of generic parts, noting that the only other time the 
organization has backed the insurance industry was when it pressed 
for laws requiring auto bumpers to withstand impacts at 5 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Ditlow contends generic auto parts are safe and help lower the  
cost of auto repairs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Consumers should be very upset,'' he said of the jury's  
decision. ``It doesn't matter to the insurer. The consumers will 
pay for this one way or another.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rust said the decision to suspend use of generic parts was  
temporary. And he said the company will appeal the jury's decision 
and the judge's ruling, warning workers it will take years before 
the case is resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	``They had to act quickly,'' Steve Goldstein of the Insurance  
Information Institute, a trade group, said of State Farm's decision 
to stop using generic parts. ``In this day and age, no matter how 
good you are, your reputation can be destroyed very quickly. If 
people think you are not putting safety first, they will move 
quickly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Goldstein said any negative view of State Farm is  
probably part of an overall lack of good will for the insurance 
industry. He noted policyholders give insurance companies a large 
amount of money in preparation for the worst possible outcome, the 
loss of a home, a car or a family member. 
</P>
<P>
	``That doesn't engender good will,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Because State Farm is a mutual insurance company owned by the  
policyholders and not traded publicly, the only way fallout from 
the jury's decision can be shown is if policies are canceled. 
</P>
<P>
	One analyst says that is unlikely.  
</P>
<P>
	``State Farm is known throughout the industry as a  
consumer-friendly type company,'' said insurance analyst Adam 
Klauber of Cochran, Caronia Securities. He said the jury's decision 
``is definitely a notch against the company. But in reality, it's 
probably not a defining event that will change the public's image 
of the company.''

<HEADLINE> Wineries Complain of Federal Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The purple grapes at the Joseph Phelps  
Vineyards site on the Internet look so moist they might drip off 
the screen. Customers reluctant to trudge to the store can order a 
bottle online from the northern California company. 
</P>
<P>
	But the ease of such direct sales, whether by phone or computer,  
has sparked a constitutional debate in Congress over the 
enforcement of local alcohol laws. Proposed legislation would give 
state authorities the power to ask federal courts to block 
shipments to states where they are outlawed. 
</P>
<P>
	Vintners nationwide are fighting the proposal as an assault on  
the growing Internet portion of their business. Direct sales by 
phone or Internet account for an estimated $500 million of the $17 
billion industry and are crucial to smaller wineries that lack the 
marketing to put their product on store shelves. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, prominent Internet companies oppose the legislation  
as a threat to electronic commerce; supporters deny that. 
</P>
<P>
	The fear is that curtailing wine sales could lead to  
restrictions on other highly regulated products such as cars or 
airline tickets, said Ben Isaacson of the Association for 
Interactive Media, which includes America Online and MCI WorldCom 
as members. 
</P>
<P>
	``This particular piece of legislation could serve as a  
precedent setter,'' Issacson said. 
</P>
<P>
	But without the legislation, state prosecutors say they have  
trouble pursuing charges against out-of-state companies. House and 
Senate conferees are negotiating whether to approve the legislation 
as part of a juvenile-justice bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``This new black market in alcohol is dangerous,'' said the  
sponsor, Rep. Joe Scarborough, R-Fla. ``It is bootlegging.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Television news crews in dozens of cases across the country have  
found that teen-agers could buy beer and wine by phone or the 
Internet using their parents' credit cards. Twenty-one state 
attorneys general endorsed the legislation as a way to end that 
access. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not asking for any new federal laws regarding the  
transportation or distribution of alcohol; we are merely asking for 
the power to enforce our own state laws already on the books,'' 
said Virginia Attorney General Mark Earley. 
</P>
<P>
	But vintners were skeptical of any widespread criminal activity.  
Internet brands tend to cost more than bottles at the corner store 
and delivery takes days, making impatient youths unlikely 
customers, they say. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just doesn't happen,'' said Tom Shelton, president of  
Phelps Vineyards in St. Helena, Calif., which sells 10 percent of 
its 100,000 cases a year via the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	California has allowed wine shipments to its residents for 36  
years. Of 10,000 complaints investigated each year about minors 
trying to buy alcohol, the state Department of Alcoholic Beverage 
Control received only one involving an attempt to buy through the 
mail, said Manuel Espinoza, the agency's chief deputy director. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms already has  
the power to revoke the license of a winery or distillery if the 
company violates a state's liquor laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Vintners contend the proposed legislation, coupled with  
stiffened local penalties, will scare producers off the Internet. 
Five states already outlaw interstate shipments and 23 others 
prohibit shipment by common carriers such as Federal Express or 
United Parcel Service. 
</P>
<P>
	``These rules are manipulated at the local level,'' Shelton  
said. ``That's very dangerous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not so, according to David Dickerson, spokesman for the Wine and  
Spirits Wholesalers of America. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not because legislators are interested in protecting  
wholesalers; what they're protecting is the ability to enforce 
their laws,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the dispute boils down to a squabble within the  
industry. Since Prohibition ended, states have strictly regulated 
alcohol sales so that producers sell to wholesalers, who sell to 
retailers, who sell to consumers. The Internet allows wineries to 
bypass wholesalers and retailers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think Congress has any business helping liquor  
distributors get away with monopolizing the business,'' said Rep. 
George Radanovich, R-Calif., who owns a winery. ``I view it as a 
direct assault on the Internet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wineries complain that under the system they can't get on store  
shelves, as the number of wholesalers has plummeted from 11,000 to 
300 in the last four decades. At the same time, the number of 
wineries grew from 375 to 1,800, with nearly half in California and 
producing 90 percent of the country's wine. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sheer arithmetic tells you a retail store cannot possibly have  
even the shelf space to offer more than a mere sample of this 
multitude of American wines,'' said Sen. Dianne Feinstein, 
D-Calif., who opposes the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``Congress should be working to promote and encourage electronic  
commerce, not taking steps which could stifle and chill its 
growth,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Dispute Over Minority Judges Grows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The volatile mix of ideology, politics and  
race has given new prominence to the long-simmering dispute between 
the White House and the Republican Senate over confirmation of 
President Clinton's choices for federal judgeships. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Senate rejected a black nominee for the federal bench  
on a strict party-line vote, Clinton called the action a disgrace. 
And he did not let the matter drop. He repeated his criticism over 
the weekend in a speech to a Hispanic group and cited the case of 
Richard Paez, a Mexican-American, nominated for a federal appeals 
court vacancy more than three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am deeply dissatisfied with the Senate's partisan handling  
of some of my minority nominees,'' Clinton said at the annual 
meeting of the national Hispanic Leadership Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans angrily counter that race has not been a factor in  
the holdup of the Paez nomination or the rejection of the 
nomination of Ronnie White, the first black to sit on the Missouri 
Supreme Court, for a federal judgeship. Nominated by Clinton 27 
months ago, White was turned down on a 54-45 vote -- all Republicans 
voting to reject the nomination and all Democrats supporting it. 
</P>
<P>
	White's detractors, led by Missouri's two Republican senators,  
argued he was opposed by law enforcement groups because he had too 
often dissented on death penalty rulings. 
</P>
<P>
	Missouri law enforcement officers, said Sen. John Ashcroft,  
R-Mo., ``are entitled to judges who will enforce the law as it is 
written, and not reach for loopholes that benefit criminals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Angry Democrats, however, said Republicans had distorted White's  
record on capital punishment. Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle 
of South Dakota called it a ``dark day'' in the Senate. ``The vote 
tells minority judicial candidates, 'do not apply.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Lott, R-Miss., shot back that Clinton had ``impugned the  
integrity'' of the Senate and ``should be ashamed'' of his 
suggestion that race played a part in GOP votes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate's second-ranked Republican, Sen. Don Nickles of  
Oklahoma, asked whether Democrats had applied a ``color test'' in 
1991 when they voted against Clarence Thomas' nomination to the 
Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	In his speech to the Hispanic Leadership Conference, Clinton  
alluded to the political stakes when he told the group that America 
increasingly ``will look like you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To warm applause, Clinton said Saturday that Hispanics are  
moving quickly ``into the mainstream of American life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The national Hispanic population of 31 million is expected to  
overtake the non-Hispanic black population to become the largest 
minority group by the end of 2004. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats have long contended that Republicans use political  
stalling tactics to keep Clinton nominees off the federal bench, 
and that minority and women nominees have fared the worst. 
Republicans respond that trouble occurs only when Clinton nominates 
candidates who are unacceptably liberal. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats cite recent findings by the bipartisan Constitution  
Project that the Senate during the 1997-98 session took an average 
186 days either to accept or reject white nominees, but 246 days 
for minorities. Moreover, the rejection rate was 14 percent for the 
92 white, and 35 percent for the 31 minority nominees. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, after a stormy debate, Frederica Massiah-Jackson  
withdrew her nomination to be the first black woman to sit on the 
federal bench in Philadelphia just days before a Senate vote she 
was likely to lose. Senate Republicans said she was soft on crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Wade Henderson of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights said  
that while minorities and women may face obstacles because they 
tend to be more liberal than the average white male judge, there 
still ``appears to be a double standard'' in the Senate's handling 
of nominees such as White. 
</P>
<P>
	Just before the White vote, Latino groups joined Democrats to  
demand action on two nominees to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, 
Paez and San Francisco attorney Marsha Berzon. Paez has been in 
limbo longer than any other nominee, and Berzon since January 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, the Judiciary Committee chairman  
responsible for moving judge nominations through the Senate, noted 
that 45 percent of the judicial nominees reported to the Senate 
floor this year have been women or minorities.

<HEADLINE> Austria, Haider Seek Common Ground </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Austria's interior minister strayed from  
his Social Democratic Party's assurances against forming a 
coalition with the far right-wing Freedom Party, saying instead 
that there may be common ground between the two parties. 
</P>
<P>
	Interior Minister Karl Schloegl told the news magazine Format in  
an issue due on newsstands Monday that the gulf between his party 
and that of conservative Joerg Haider may not be so wide to 
preclude working together. 
</P>
<P>
	``In politics, nothing can be permanently shut out,'' Schloegl  
was quoted as saying. ``I am, however, skeptical that (Haider) 
personally is acceptable to us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since last weekend's national election, in which the  
anti-immigrant Freedom Party won 27 percent of the vote, the Social 
Democrats have vehemently denied that they would consider forming a 
coalition with Haider's group. 
</P>
<P>
	Most exit polls show that the constituency of Haider, son of a  
Nazi party member, is young working-class men who fear that EU 
expansion and a liberal immigration policy will cost them their 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Freedom Party campaign included in its platform restricted  
immigration. Some of the party's election posters were criticized 
as being blatantly anti-foreigner. 
</P>
<P>
	With the counting of votes still incomplete, the Freedom Party  
is competing closely for second place with the conservative 
Austrian Peoples Party -- until now the junior coalition partner 
with the Social Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Counting of absentee votes will decide final placings, but the  
People's Party has threatened to go into opposition should it 
finish third. The final result is expected Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Schloegl also criticized the opposition Greens and Liberal Forum

<HEADLINE> Broncos' Sharpe Fractures Collarbone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Denver tight end Shannon Sharpe fractured  
his left collarbone late in the third quarter of Sunday's game 
against the Oakland Raiders, adding to the Broncos' long list of 
serious injuries this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharpe, who has gone to seven consecutive Pro Bowls and is tied  
for first among NFL tight ends with three 1,000-yard receiving 
seasons, was hit by two defenders and landed hard on the ground as 
he attempted to catch a pass from Brian Griese. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharpe, who has seven straight 50-catch seasons, was unable to  
hold on to the pass and had to be helped off the field. 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos already are missing running back Terrell Davis and  
linebacker John Mobley for the season.

<HEADLINE> First Drug To Treat Stress Disorder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                          *BY PHIL GALEWITZ   	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- After watching one of his firemen die in the  
line of duty, fire Chief John Soave became withdrawn, had trouble 
sleeping and was bothered by flashbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors diagnosed him with post-traumatic stress disorder, a  
psychiatric condition once associated only with combat veterans, 
but now known to affect millions of people who experience car 
accidents, sexual assaults and other horrible incidents. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of his treatment, Soave was prescribed Zoloft, a drug  
first approved in 1992 for depression. 
</P>
<P>
	``It helped calm me down,'' said Soave, of Stoughton, Mass.,  
whose been taking Pfizer's once-a-day pill for two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on its early success, Zoloft later this year is expected  
to become the first prescription medication specifically approved 
by the federal government for post-traumatic stress. 
</P>
<P>
	A Food and Drug Administration advisory panel on Friday approved  
the drug's expanded labeling, and the agency usually follows its 
advice. However, despite Soave's success, panelists cautioned the 
drug so far seems to help only women, not men with the anxiety 
disorder. 
</P>
<P>
	Health experts say the approval will be both symbolic-- by  
drawing more attention and perhaps research dollars to the disorder 
-- and it will have the practical effect of leading more doctors to 
prescribe the medication and make patients more accepting of it. 
</P>
<P>
	It is estimated that about 7 percent of Americans will suffer  
from post traumatic stress at some point in their life. 
</P>
<P>
	Psychiatrists, who believe Zoloft makes patients more amenable  
to the counseling necessary to overcome their disorder, say the FDA 
approval would help increase awareness of the disease that often 
goes untreated. That's because drug companies like Pfizer typically 
spend heavily educating consumers and doctors about a condition 
once they win expanded labeling. 
</P>
<P>
	After the FDA approves a drug for one disease, doctors can  
prescribe it for any purpose, though pharmaceutical firms can only 
market it for the specific condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Mental health experts applaud Pfizer's attempt to get the  
additional FDA approval for Zoloft. 
</P>
<P>
	But Pfizer has its own motivations.  
</P>
<P>
	Zoloft is Pfizer's second leading selling drug, behind blood  
pressure pill Norvasc. Zoloft, which is expected to record $2.1 
billion in sales this year, is locked in a battle with several 
other antidepressants including Eli Lilly's top seller Prozac and 
SmithKline Beecham's Paxil, which is a close third. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the three drugs are similar, the companies have tried to  
differentiate them by getting approved for conditions beyond 
depression. SmithKline, for example, this summer won federal 
approval to market Paxil to treat social phobia or extreme shyness. 
Eli Lilly is seeking FDA approval to market Prozac for the most 
severe form of premenstrual syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
	Expanding the uses of an existing drug is one of the most common  
methods pharmaceutical firms use to build profits. It's 
considerably cheaper and less risky than developing a new drug. 
</P>
<P>
	The expanded labeling should give a small boost to Zoloft sales,  
said Alex Zisson, a securities analyst with Hambrecht &AMP; Quist. More 
significantly, he said, it will help Pfizer improve its ties with 
psychiatrists. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good way to keep the thought leaders in the psychiatric  
community happy with the company,'' Zisson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Patients who suffer from post-traumatic stress experience a wide  
variety of symptoms including nightmares, flashbacks and intrusive 
recollections -- patients think about the events that caused the 
trauma even though they don't want to. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts stress Zoloft helps with the symptoms but is not a cure.  
Only counseling helps patients get over the trauma. Women are more 
likely than men to develop the condition, though researchers are 
not sure why. 
</P>
<P>
	``The drug is quite helpful,'' said Dr. Bessl vanderKolk, a  
psychiatrist at Boston University. ``It helps people to be less 
there and more here; it helps people live in the present and be 
less overwhelmed by their past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A study of 187 post traumatic stress patients found that those  
who took Zoloft had significantly fewer symptoms than those taking 
a dummy pill, according to a report presented at the American 
Psychiatric Association meeting earlier this year. Patients had 
fewer feelings of hopelessness and memory impairment. 
</P>
<P>
	The most common side effect shown in the studies was insomnia  
and dry mouth. The study was funded by Pfizer. 
</P>
<P>
	Soave, who resigned as fire chief in January 1998, was not a  
part of the study. He said Zoloft and counseling have helped him 
deal with the emotional toll of the fatal fire that occurred in 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``It never goes away, but the impact is much lower than what it  
was.''

<HEADLINE> Delay of Test Ban Treaty Vote Sought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House dispatched Cabinet members  
Sunday to press the Senate to put off voting on a nuclear test ban 
treaty headed for rejection, saying a defeat would endanger 
nonproliferation efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	One Republican opponent, Sen. Jon Kyl of Arizona, voicing  
widespread GOP concerns about verification, said he welcomed a 
chance ``to go back to the drawing board.'' He predicted certain 
defeat of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty if the expected vote 
Tuesday goes forward. 
</P>
<P>
	Three Cabinet members and the president's top military officer,  
pleading the administration's case on the Sunday talk shows, said 
rejecting the treaty would prevent the United States from taking 
the lead in halting the global spread of nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are in a situation right now where we're about to send a  
signal to the rest of the world that we are not as serious about 
controlling the spread of nuclear weapons as we should be,'' 
Defense Secretary William Cohen said on NBC's ``Meet the Press.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said on ABC's ``This  
Week'' that the United States needs ``a tool that will prevent the 
other countries from testing. We believe that we have a reliable 
stockpile (of nuclear weapons). We don't need to test more and we 
want others not to test.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Cohen's side was Gen. Henry H. Shelton, chairman of the Joint  
Chiefs of Staff, who sought to assure the public that the treaty 
would not handicap the United States militarily. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the national security were in any way going to be damaged,  
the joint chiefs would never recommend that we ratify this 
treaty,'' Shelton said. 
</P>
<P>
	And Energy Secretary Bill Richardson joined Cohen and Albright  
in saying the Senate should not act on the treaty without benefit 
of full hearings. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we have now is the need to explain it to the Senate, to  
the Congress,'' he said on Fox. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate opponents led by Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.,  
have said the vote will proceed unless President Clinton withdraws 
the treaty and promises not to resubmit it. 
</P>
<P>
	Kyl contended a defeat would strengthen the United States' hand  
in negotiations with other countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the Senate must vote on this treaty and defeat it,''  
he said on ``Fox News Sunday.'' ``This treaty is not of the same 
caliber as previous arms control treaties.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The treaty would impose a blanket international ban on all  
nuclear test explosions. Supporters estimate they are 15 to 20 
votes short of the two-thirds majority needed for ratification. 
</P>
<P>
	The treaty has been signed by 154 nations, including the United  
States, but ratified by only 48. It will not go into effect if the 
United States does not ratify it. 
</P>
<P>
	Some congressional conservatives argue the United States should  
not give up its right to conduct nuclear tests. But Clinton and 
Democratic leaders say that substantive issue has gotten lost in 
partisan politics. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton sent the signed treaty to the Republican-led Senate two  
years ago. Leaders had refused to hold debate on it before now. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think for the Senate to take it up and just have a couple of  
days of hearing and vote is not a responsible course of action,'' 
Cohen said. ``My own judgment is that we will be seen as being 
frivolous and cavalier by many other nations around the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kyl said senators have had more than enough time to study the  
issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``The treaty is not verifiable,'' he said. ``It has no  
enforcement mechanism whatsoever. ... No president has ever asked 
the United States to submit itself to a treaty in perpetuity that 
would prevent us from testing our nuclear weapons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen and Albright also said it is true that the United States  
cannot detect all nuclear tests conducted by other countries. But 
it can detect test blasts above a certain level, and experts 
believe those below that would not pose a danger to the United 
States.

<HEADLINE> California Signs Nursing Ratio Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- California will set nurse staffing  
requirements for all hospitals for the first time and allow only 
licensed workers to perform certain medical tasks under a bill 
signed Sunday by Gov. Gray Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	The California Nurses Association described the measure as ``a  
landmark bill that will make California the first state in the 
nation to require safe hospital staffing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is one of the most significant days in the history of  
nursing,'' Kay McVay, president of the nursing group, said in a 
written statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic governor also signed bills aimed at controlling  
the proliferation of new telephone area codes and starting a 
low-cost auto insurance test program in Los Angeles and San 
Francisco counties as he faced a midnight Sunday deadline to act on 
bills passed this year by the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
	The text of the nursing law does not specify minimum  
nurse-to-patient ratios, but instead requires the state Department 
of Health Services to set those standards. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, the state sets nurse-patient ratios only for critical  
care units and neonatal intensive care units. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis said he signed the bill with the understanding that the  
author, Democratic Assemblywoman Sheila Kuehl, will sponsor a 
followup bill delaying its implementation until 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure also will bar hospitals from assigning unlicensed  
workers to perform certain procedures, including administering 
medication, and it will prohibit hospitals from shifting nurses 
trained in one unit to another unit without adequate preparation. 
</P>
<P>
	Health industry lobbyists had strenuously opposed the bill,  
arguing that hospitals should make staffing decisions and that 
state intervention would only drive up treatment costs.

<HEADLINE> Colt To End Consumer Handgun Orders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Colt's Manufacturing Company will  
virtually stop taking orders for commercial handguns before the 
month is over, Newsweek reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing industry sources it did not name, the newsmagazine said  
in editions that hit newsstands Monday that the West Hartford-based 
gunmaker also will lay off as many as 300 of its 700 union workers 
in Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven Sliwa, president and chief executive of Colt's, could not  
be reached for comment by The Associated Press. A telephone message 
was left at his home Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Calling Colt's the biggest victim of lawsuits filed against the  
gun industry, Newsweek reported that the cash-squeezed company is 
having trouble paying its vendors and hopes to avoid the damage of 
a possible jury verdict by abandoning the handgun business -- at 
least for now. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to focus on what we know we can make money on, without  
taking that risk,'' a Colt's executive told Newsweek. ``It's 
extremely painful when you have to withdraw from a business for 
irrational reasons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colt's will keep making military and collectible guns, which are  
the bulk of its business, Newsweek reported. And its new startup 
company -- iColt -- plans to market a ``smart gun,'' which can be 
fired only by the owner, sometime next year.

<HEADLINE> 600 Gather at Matthew Shepard Vigil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- About 600 people gathered Sunday night for  
a candelight vigil honoring Matthew Shepard, the gay college 
student who was fatally beaten and tied to a post a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``We on this campus, in Laramie and in Wyoming, are people of  
peace, of inclusiveness,'' the Rev. Roger Schmit, of St. Paul's 
Newman Center, told people on the University of Wyoming campus. 
</P>
<P>
	One of two men accused in the slaying, Aaron McKinney, 22, goes  
on trial Monday on charges of first-degree murder, kidnapping and 
aggravated robbery. 
</P>
<P>
	The other suspect, Russell Henderson, 22, pleaded guilty in  
April to felony murder and kidnapping and received two life 
sentences. 
</P>
<P>
	Shepard, 21, was lured from a bar Oct. 7, 1998, driven to a  
remote prairie, tied to a fence, pistol-whipped into 
unconsciousness and left to die on the freezing plains. 
</P>
<P>
	He died on Oct. 12, 1998, and McKinney's trial begins amid  
several memorials commemorating the one-year anniversary of his 
death.

<HEADLINE> Georgia Had Odd Gov. Race in 1947 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The dead voted, one ``governor'' was hanged in  
effigy, another tried to rule from a Capitol information desk, the 
state seal disappeared and national magazines sneered. 
</P>
<P>
	For 63 days, until a court ruling settled the matter, three men  
-- all Democrats -- laid claim to the Georgia governor's office in 
1947. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia politics in the 1940s were sport and entertainment.  
</P>
<P>
	One of the most flamboyant figures was Eugene Talmadge, who by  
1946 had already served three terms as governor. He was not in 
office that year, but was itching to return. 
</P>
<P>
	His previous terms had provided endless cracker barrel debate  
over such things as the time he declared martial law around the 
Capitol and used armed security men to establish his power over a 
recalcitrant highway department. 
</P>
<P>
	His evangelical-style stump speeches promised low taxes, small  
government, white supremacy, a $3 car tag and special benefits for 
veterans. 
</P>
<P>
	But Talmadge was 62 and ailing. As a contingency, people close  
to him quietly mobilized a write-in campaign for his 33-year-old 
son, Herman. 
</P>
<P>
	They were banking on a provision of the Georgia Constitution  
which stipulated that if no ``person'' won a majority vote, the 
Legislature would choose a governor from among the other leading 
candidates. They theorized that if Eugene Talmadge died, he could 
not be considered a person. 
</P>
<P>
	Talmadge easily won -- and died Dec. 21, before taking office.  
</P>
<P>
	His son claimed the governorship.  
</P>
<P>
	But M.E. Thompson, who had just been elected Georgia's first  
lieutenant governor, said he should become acting governor. And 
incumbent Gov. Ellis Arnall announced he would relinquish the 
office only to Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
	On Jan. 14, the Legislature met to canvass the vote and found  
that, out of three candidates, Herman Talmadge was third. 
</P>
<P>
	But then the canvassers turned up 58 more write-in votes for  
Talmadge from Telfair County, the Talmadge home. 
</P>
<P>
	Talmadge was elected governor by the Legislature and went to  
claim the office from Arnall. 
</P>
<P>
	Jimmy Bentley, a young Talmadge volunteer, was a witness to the  
proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ellis came out and Talmadge said to him, `I've come to claim  
the governor's office.' Ellis says to him, `I don't accept this. I 
consider you an impostor,''' Bentley recalled. ``Talmadge said, 
`Thank you,' and turned and instructed a state trooper to be sure 
that Arnall got to his home safely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Time magazine reported the pro-Talmadge crowd charged the door  
and an Arnall aide's jaw was broken. 
</P>
<P>
	The next day, the two men sat 20 feet apart, Arnall in his  
office and Talmadge in an anteroom. 
</P>
<P>
	When Arnall left for the night, Talmadge had the office locks  
changed. So the next morning, Arnall commandeered an information 
desk in the Capitol rotunda and governed from there. 
</P>
<P>
	Within a few days, Arnall resigned in favor of Thompson but  
Talmadge still occupied the office. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even the South had never seen anything quite like the  
Caesarean operation by which Hummon (for the Georgian pronunciation 
of Herman) was jerked out of obscurity ... and installed in the 
governor's mansion in his pappy's place,'' said Time magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	There were lawsuits and protests. University students hanged  
Talmadge in effigy. 
</P>
<P>
	The state seal, needed for official documents, couldn't be  
found. Secretary of State Ben Fortson later revealed he had hidden 
it beneath the seat of his wheelchair because he didn't know who 
was governor. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, The Atlanta Journal hit the streets with the headline  
``Telfair Dead Were Voted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 58 late Telfair County votes, 34 had been cast in  
alphabetical order, some of the alleged voters had been dead for 
years, and some of the living said they hadn't gone to the polls. 
</P>
<P>
	No one ever was prosecuted for voter fraud. Talmadge wrote in  
his 1987 autobiography that he never told his workers to steal 
votes. 
</P>
<P>
	On March 19, the state Supreme Court said Talmadge supporters  
had misconstrued the Constitution, and ruled 5-2 that Thompson was 
head of state until a special election could be held for the 
remainder of Eugene Talmadge's term. 
</P>
<P>
	The special election was held Sept. 8, 1948, and Herman Talmadge  
won. He was elected to a full term in 1950, then ran successfully 
for the Senate in 1956, serving until 1980 when he was defeated 
after being denounced by the Senate Ethics Committee for 
mismanagement of his office finances.

<TEXT>
<P>
	LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- A Ukrainian-Russian rocket carrying a  
U.S. satellite roared off a launch platform in the Pacific, the 
first commercial liftoff for the Sea Launch Co., an international 
consortium led by Boeing. 
</P>
<P>
	The 200-foot-tall Zenit-3SL rocket rose off the oceangoing  
platform late Saturday at a point near the equator, carrying the 
7,600-pound satellite for DirecTV. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was beautiful,'' said Anne Eisele, a Boeing spokeswoman who  
watched from Sea Launch headquarters in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	The self-propelled launch pad, accompanied by a support ship, is  
a former oil drilling platform. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the Earth moves faster at the equator, rockets launched  
there have an advantage in reaching orbit with heavier payloads. 
</P>
<P>
	The DirecTV satellite reached geosynchronous orbit, one that  
keeps it over the same place on Earth, about 62 minutes after 
liftoff. 
</P>
<P>
	Sea Launch has orders for 19 more launches through 2003.  
</P>
<P>
	The company's partners are Boeing Commercial Space Co. of Kent,  
Wash.; Norwegian ship builder Kvaerner Maritime; Russia's RSC 
Energia, and Ukrainian rocket maker KB Yuzhnoye/PO Yuzhmash. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ukrainian company provides the first two stages of the  
rocket and Energia builds the upper stage. Boeing performs the 
spacecraft integration.

<HEADLINE> Red Sox Shine in Prime Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- No, they didn't change uniforms. And no, that  
wasn't Manny Ramirez driving in all those runs. 
</P>
<P>
	That really was the Red Sox setting major-league postseason  
records with 23 runs and 24 hits against baseball's highest scoring 
team since 1950, the Cleveland Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	And the seven RBIs? Boston's John Valentin got those, not  
Ramirez, whose 165 RBIs were the most in the majors since 1938. 
Valentin did it with two homers, a double and a single, all in the 
first four innings. 
</P>
<P>
	He had plenty of company as Boston pounded five Cleveland  
pitchers in a 23-7 win Sunday: Trot Nixon and Jose Offerman each 
drove in five runs, Jason Varitek went 4-for-5 with three RBIs and 
a postseason record five runs, and Mike Stanley went 5-for-6. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox hope they have enough strength left to swing the  
bats some more in Monday night's decisive fifth game in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	At least they got there -- on a day in which they outscored 19  
NFL teams. 
</P>
<P>
	A day earlier, that seemed about as unlikely as Valentin getting  
a hit. 
</P>
<P>
	They totaled three runs and 11 hits in losing the first two  
games at Cleveland, and he was 0-for-10 going into the bottom of 
the sixth of Game 3 with the score at 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Then everything changed.  
</P>
<P>
	Valentin's solo homer put the Red Sox ahead, but the third  
baseman's second costly throwing error of the series allowed 
Cleveland to tie the game in the seventh Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	No problem.  
</P>
<P>
	Valentin came up again in the bottom of the seventh and broke  
the tie with a two-run double. That started a six-run inning that 
gave the Red Sox a 9-3 win. 
</P>
<P>
	And on Sunday, he and the Red Sox earned several lines in next  
year's postseason record book. 
</P>
<P>
	The previous record for most runs in a postseason game was 18 by  
the New York Yankees in an 18-4 win over the New York Giants in the 
1936 World Series. The previous record for most hits in a 
postseason game was 22 by Atlanta against St. Louis in Game 7 of 
the 1996 NL Championship Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Valentin's seven RBIs tied the division series record held by  
former teammate Mo Vaughn, who did it in last year's opener at 
Cleveland, and Seattle's Edgar Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
	His 11 total bases broke the division series record of 10 shared  
by Vaughn and Eric Karros of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Valentin accomplished something that may be more amazing.  
</P>
<P>
	He came to bat in each of the last three innings Saturday and  
each of the first four Sunday. In those seven straight appearances, 
he homered, doubled, lined out to right, homered again, singled, 
homered yet again and doubled. 
</P>
<P>
	That added up to four runs and 10 RBIs in a span of just seven  
innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Pretty good for a player who hit just .253 with 12 homers and  
wasn't assured of a spot on the postseason roster until he returned 
from the disabled list on Sept. 23. He went on it Aug. 31 with 
tendinitis in his left knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Rookie Wilton Veras played well in his place. But Valentin  
assured his playoff spot by ending the season with a five-game 
hitting streak and staying healthy. 
</P>
<P>
	He finally was stopped Sunday when he struck out -- swinging, of  
course -- against Sean DePaula in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
	Valentin was due up in the seventh, but with the score 21-6,  
manager Jimy Williams sent up Donnie Sadler to pinch hit. 
</P>
<P>
	Naturally, Sadler doubled.

<HEADLINE> GOP Lawmaker Criticize Bush </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Republican lawmaker said Sunday that  
continued attacks by George W. Bush could hurt him on Capitol Hill 
should the GOP front-runner become president. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope that he doesn't get in a mode of attacking those of us  
in the majority party who are working very hard to do the people's 
business and then expect to come to the Washington as the president 
and work with us,'' Rep. Ray LaHood, R-Ill., said on CBS's ``Face 
the Nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Jimmy Carter tried that when he was elected president, running  
against the Congress and couldn't get anything done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, in what was widely seen as an opportunity to move to the  
political middle, recently criticized the House Republicans' plan 
to alter a tax credit for the working poor in order to help balance 
the budget. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after that, a second GOP presidential contender, Sen.  
John McCain, joined in, saying lawmakers were picking on the 
working poor rather than special interest groups that contribute 
money to the party. 
</P>
<P>
	LaHood, who has endorsed Bush and helped raise campaign funds,  
said such comments would not lay the groundwork for positive 
relations between Congress and a Bush White House. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those of us who support George Bush want him to do well,''  
LaHood said. ``But we also want to be part of that winning team. 
You don't do it by knocking those of us who are working 12 to 14 
hours a day trying to do the people's business in Washington. If he 
has differences with us as the majority party, we ought to sit down 
in a closed door room and talk about them. We are not trying to 
balance the budget on the backs of the poor. That simply is not 
true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GOP presidential hopeful Gary Bauer said Bush was talking like a  
liberal Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
	``When does the governor start attacking Al Gore or Ted Kennedy  
or the Democratic Party?'' Bauer said on CBS' ``Face the Nation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks to me like he's trying to get the nomination of the  
Democratic party, devoting his energy to attacking good Republican 
conservatives. He's the front-runner in the party. If he has a 
problem with something going on in Congress, pick up the phone and 
say something about it, but don't provide fodder for the Democrats 
to use in 2000 to defeat our party,'' Bauer said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bush campaign did not immediately respond Sunday to a  
request for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the criticism from Bush and McCain, Rep. Tom DeLay of  
Texas, the third-ranking House Republican, said on NBC's ``Meet the 
Press'' that House GOP leaders still were considering the tax 
credit change.

<HEADLINE> Georgia Had Odd Gov. Race in 1947 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The dead voted, one ``governor'' was hanged in  
effigy, another tried to rule from a Capitol information desk, the 
state seal disappeared and national magazines sneered. 
</P>
<P>
	For 63 days, until a court ruling settled the matter, three men  
-- all Democrats -- laid claim to the Georgia governor's office in 
1947. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia politics in the 1940s were sport and entertainment.  
</P>
<P>
	One of the most flamboyant figures was Eugene Talmadge, who by  
1946 had already served three terms as governor. He was not in 
office that year, but was itching to return. 
</P>
<P>
	His previous terms had provided endless cracker barrel debate  
over such things as the time he declared martial law around the 
Capitol and used armed security men to establish his power over a 
recalcitrant highway department. 
</P>
<P>
	His evangelical-style stump speeches promised low taxes, small  
government, white supremacy, a $3 car tag and special benefits for 
veterans. 
</P>
<P>
	But Talmadge was 62 and ailing. As a contingency, people close  
to him quietly mobilized a write-in campaign for his 33-year-old 
son, Herman. 
</P>
<P>
	They were banking on a provision of the Georgia Constitution  
which stipulated that if no ``person'' won a majority vote, the 
Legislature would choose a governor from among the other leading 
candidates. They theorized that if Eugene Talmadge died, he could 
not be considered a person. 
</P>
<P>
	Talmadge easily won -- and died Dec. 21, before taking office.  
</P>
<P>
	His son claimed the governorship.  
</P>
<P>
	But M.E. Thompson, who had just been elected Georgia's first  
lieutenant governor, said he should become acting governor. And 
incumbent Gov. Ellis Arnall announced he would relinquish the 
office only to Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
	On Jan. 14, the Legislature met to canvass the vote and found  
that, out of three candidates, Herman Talmadge was third. 
</P>
<P>
	But then the canvassers turned up 58 more write-in votes for  
Talmadge from Telfair County, the Talmadge home. 
</P>
<P>
	Talmadge was elected governor by the Legislature and went to  
claim the office from Arnall. 
</P>
<P>
	Jimmy Bentley, a young Talmadge volunteer, was a witness to the  
proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ellis came out and Talmadge said to him, `I've come to claim  
the governor's office.' Ellis says to him, `I don't accept this. I 
consider you an impostor,''' Bentley recalled. ``Talmadge said, 
`Thank you,' and turned and instructed a state trooper to be sure 
that Arnall got to his home safely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Time magazine reported the pro-Talmadge crowd charged the door  
and an Arnall aide's jaw was broken. 
</P>
<P>
	The next day, the two men sat 20 feet apart, Arnall in his  
office and Talmadge in an anteroom. 
</P>
<P>
	When Arnall left for the night, Talmadge had the office locks  
changed. So the next morning, Arnall commandeered an information 
desk in the Capitol rotunda and governed from there. 
</P>
<P>
	Within a few days, Arnall resigned in favor of Thompson but  
Talmadge still occupied the office. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even the South had never seen anything quite like the  
Caesarean operation by which Hummon (for the Georgian pronunciation 
of Herman) was jerked out of obscurity ... and installed in the 
governor's mansion in his pappy's place,'' said Time magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	There were lawsuits and protests. University students hanged  
Talmadge in effigy. 
</P>
<P>
	The state seal, needed for official documents, couldn't be  
found. Secretary of State Ben Fortson later revealed he had hidden 
it beneath the seat of his wheelchair because he didn't know who 
was governor. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, The Atlanta Journal hit the streets with the headline  
``Telfair Dead Were Voted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 58 late Telfair County votes, 34 had been cast in  
alphabetical order, some of the alleged voters had been dead for 
years, and some of the living said they hadn't gone to the polls. 
</P>
<P>
	No one ever was prosecuted for voter fraud. Talmadge wrote in  
his 1987 autobiography that he never told his workers to steal 
votes. 
</P>
<P>
	On March 19, the state Supreme Court said Talmadge supporters  
had misconstrued the Constitution, and ruled 5-2 that Thompson was 
head of state until a special election could be held for the 
remainder of Eugene Talmadge's term. 
</P>
<P>
	The special election was held Sept. 8, 1948, and Herman Talmadge  
won. He was elected to a full term in 1950, then ran successfully 
for the Senate in 1956, serving until 1980 when he was defeated 
after being denounced by the Senate Ethics Committee for 
mismanagement of his office finances.

<HEADLINE> Lone Star State Laments Texas Losses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	While New Yorkers dream of a Subway Series, fans in the Lone  
Star State can only lament of what might have been. 
</P>
<P>
	Hopes for an I-45 World Series or maybe a fourth Texas vs. New  
York championship series this year were squashed over the weekend 
when the Houston Astros and Texas Rangers were eliminated from the 
first round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	In case you're counting, that makes them 0-for-ever in playoff  
series. 
</P>
<P>
	Good karma was the best reason to think 1999 would be different.  
</P>
<P>
	After all, the Dallas Stars won their first Stanley Cup, the San  
Antonio Spurs won their first NBA title and the Houston Comets 
ruled the WNBA for the third time in the league's three years. And 
don't forget the individual achievements of Lance Armstrong and 
Michael Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers roared into the postseason with 95 wins, their most  
ever, and one of the most potent offenses in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	They limped out by scoring a grand total of one run in three  
losses to the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas lost 3-0 in the finale Saturday night, extending the  
club's playoff losing streak to nine straight -- all to the Yankees. 
Home fans have yet to see the Rangers win a postseason game in four 
tries. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no jinx,'' Rafael Palmeiro of the Rangers said. ``We  
just didn't do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just getting to the playoffs was impressive enough considering  
all the injuries and illness the Astros endured along the way to 
their third straight NL Central title. 
</P>
<P>
	After splitting two games in Atlanta, there was hope Friday that  
Houston would go up 2-1 in the best-of-5 series. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Braves held off a bases-loaded, no-outs jam and won 5-3  
in 12 innings, then won 7-5 Saturday in what turned out to be the 
final baseball game in the Astrodome. 
</P>
<P>
	The Astros will play outdoors, on grass at Enron Field next  
year. Maybe that will change their luck. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're a winning team,'' first baseman Jeff Bagwell said.  
``We'll come through sooner or later.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even the biggest optimist in the Lone Star State knew the odds  
were heavily against an all-Texas World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	But it would have been fitting for one of them to make the  
League Championship Series against either the New York's Mets or 
Yankees considering the NHL, NBA and WNBA championships were fought 
between teams from Texas and New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Alas, with no chance for Texas to win a fourth pro sports title,  
there's only one thing left for Texans to root for: a fourth finals 
loss by a New York team.

<HEADLINE> Broncos' Brister, Loville Injured </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- The Denver Broncos, already beset by  
injuries, got even more bad news before Sunday's game against the 
Oakland Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
	Bubby Brister, who was named the starting quarterback on  
Wednesday after backing up Brian Griese for the first four weeks of 
the season, was sidelined when he felt rib pain in his pregame 
warmups. 
</P>
<P>
	Brister strained an oblique muscle in his left side during a  
non-contact practice on Friday, though he was unclear how the 
injury occurred. Brister still planned to start until Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Griese, who struggled while the Broncos lost their first four  
games, was reinstalled as the starter. 
</P>
<P>
	Derek Loville, who was expected to start in place of injured  
tailback Terrell Davis, was inactive for the Raiders game. Loville 
is bothered by a strained left hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting in place of Loville was rookie Olandis Gary.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Army Disarms Mosque Bomb </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) -- Army experts recovered a time bomb  
Sunday from a mosque in Dhaka, three days after a mosque bombing 
killed six people in Bangladesh's southwest, a military commander 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bomb was found lying in a mosque inside the headquarters  
complex of the Jamaat-e-Ahmadiyya in the Bangladeshi capital, said 
army Maj. Ahsan. 
</P>
<P>
	Ahmadiyya Muslims, a minority sect, first saw the bomb when they  
went to the mosque to offer early-morning prayers. They informed 
police, who called in the army. 
</P>
<P>
	The sect was founded in late 1880s by Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, who  
claimed to be Islam's last prophet. The majority Sunni Muslims 
usually target the Ahmadiyyas for not recognizing Mohammad, the 
founder of Islam, as the last prophet. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, a group called Khatme Nabuyat, or the Last Prophet,  
held a rally in Dhaka asking the government to declare Ahmadiyyas 
non-Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Sunday that three people were detained for  
questioning in Friday's bomb blast, which killed six people at an 
Ahmadiyya mosque in the southwestern city of Khulna. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, military experts diffused a time bomb found in a  
candy box during Friday prayers in an Ahmadiyya mosque in Dhaka's 
northern Mirpur district. 
</P>
<P>
	The experts also defused an antitank land mine found in a  
leather box on Friday at the reception desk of Dhaka's Janakantha 
newspaper office. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities stepped up vigilance at mosques and movie houses  
across Bangladesh, the country's police chief Ayub Siddiqui said. 
Home Minister Mohammad Nasim met with high-level security officials 
on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Cubs Pitcher Reveals Heart Defect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Chicago Cubs pitcher Kerry Wood has a dime-sized  
hole in his heart, a condition that probably will not affect his 
baseball career, the Chicago Tribune reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 22-year-old Wood, the 1998 NL rookie of the year, missed the  
entire season after blowing out his right elbow in March. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, however, Wood learned he had a condition called  
atrial septal defect, which can cause a gradual weakening of the 
heart and cut life expectancy to 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right before spring training I got a viral infection and my  
system got really worn down,'' Wood told the Tribune. ``I woke up 
one morning at 5 in the morning and I was really sick. I'd been 
sick the last couple of nights, not able to keep anything down. I 
was worn down, so I ended up going to the hospital.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a hospital in Mesa, Wood said, ``they couldn't keep my blood  
pressure up, so they did some tests on my heart and found a little 
hole . . . and it was leaking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors discovered the hole in the wall separating the two upper  
chambers. Doctors often recommend that the hole be closed at some 
point -- Wood's doctors told him his would have to be fixed by the 
time he was 30 or 40. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood chose not to have surgery right away.  
</P>
<P>
	``Most (people with ASD) survive,'' Dr. Keith Horvath, assistant  
professor of cardiothoracic surgery at Northwestern University 
Medical School, told the Tribune. 
</P>
<P>
	``From a surgical point of view, it's a very low-risk thing to  
fix. Most of the time if people have one, they become symptomatic 
by the time they're in their 30s, or a lot of times at 2 or 3,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cardiologists call ASD a ``silent killer'' because it affects a  
person over a long period. But they said there is no danger of Wood 
collapsing on the mound while pitching, even if the hole goes 
unfixed. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a Hank Gathers or Reggie Lewis (situation),''  
Horvath said, mentioning two star athletes who died unexpectedly of 
heart ailments at young ages. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood, who tied a major league record with 20 strikeouts in a  
game in 1998 while going 13-6, later learned that his mother, 
43-year-old Terry, also had ASD. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood said he will have an echocardiogram (an ultrasound of the  
heart) done every year. Horvath said Wood probably can wait to have 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to balance the risk and the benefit,'' he said. ``How  
long is his career going to be? Can he wait a few years? Sure, 
probably. But at some point, what can happen is that the blood ends 
up going in the wrong direction, and it leads to congestion in the 
lungs. You develop high blood pressure in the lungs. The problem is 
we can't treat that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wood intends to return to the Cubs next season.  
</P>
<P>
	``The thing that's motivated me the most are the people who've  
said I'm not going to come back,'' he said. ``I've had a lot of 
support from fans and other players when I've gone on the road, a 
lot of concern. Guys who have never met me before (are) coming up 
to me and asking me how I'm doing, wishing me well and for a quick 
and healthy recovery. That's very uplifting, and the fan support 
has been tremendous. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's going to drive me the most is all the people who are  
saying I'm not going to be the same, I'm not going to come back,'' 
he said.

<HEADLINE> Socialists Lead Portugal Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LISBON, Portugal (AP) -- Buoyed by a robust economy and a  
confident mood among many Portuguese, the governing Socialist Party 
was returned to power by a comfortable margin in the country's 
general election Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the center-left Socialists fell short of the outright  
majority in parliament, which they said they needed to enact a 
long-promised package of important reforms. They will rule as a 
minority government. 
</P>
<P>
	The Socialist Party won 44 percent of the vote, according to  
official results and with more than 95 percent of ballots counted. 
That gives them at least 111 seats in the 230-seat Republican 
Assembly, Portugal's parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	The main opposition, the center-right Social Democratic Party,  
received 32 percent of the vote, giving them 79 seats. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven seats, pertaining to voters abroad and districts in  
Portugal that boycotted the election, were to be announced in 
coming days. Projections said the Socialists would get only two of 
those seats. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister and Socialist leader Antonio Guterres said voters  
did not grant him an overall majority in parliament because they 
wanted him to be attentive to the proposals of opposition parties. 
</P>
<P>
	He urged the opposition to ``help the Portuguese to live better  
and help Portugal to develop and undertake the changes needed for 
it to play its role in Europe and the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Socialists say they want to press ahead with wide-ranging  
reforms in the tax, social security, justice and health sectors. 
They say they were unable to deliver the reforms in their previous 
mandate because they were a minority government. 
</P>
<P>
	The Communist Party/Green Party coalition collected 10 percent  
of the vote and 17 seats, the conservative Popular Party snared 9 
percent and 14 seats, and the Leftist Bloc got 2.5 percent and two 
seats. 
</P>
<P>
	In the last general election in 1995, the Socialists took 112  
seats compared with 88 seats for the Social Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the Social Democrats' poor showing, party leader Jose  
Durao Barroso said he would not resign. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past four years, the Socialists have overseen a buoyant  
economy. Economic growth is forecast at 3.3 percent this year, 
ahead of the European Union average of 3 percent. Inflation is down 
to 2 percent, and the jobless rate is 4.9 percent, half the EU 
average. 
</P>
<P>
	Proving doubters wrong, Portugal made the grade for membership  
of the euro, Europe's single currency. Adding to a growing sense of 
confidence, the country hosted the $2 billion Expo 98 world's fair, 
and in 1998, writer Jose Saramago became the first Portuguese 
writer to win the Nobel Prize in literature. 
</P>
<P>
	Campaigning over the past two weeks was muted because political  
parties and the electorate were distracted by events in East Timor, 
a former Portuguese colony that is a cherished public issue. Also, 
the death last week of famed 'fado' singer and national icon Amalia 
Rodrigues prompted three days of national mourning.

<HEADLINE> Relief Workers Get Lesson on Kids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When Dr. Karen Olness packed her bags to go  
help care for Rwandan refugees fleeing genocide, she threw in five 
toys. The payoff came soon enough: several hundred injured orphans 
enjoying a few minutes of pleasure in a hospital that had lacked 
even a single plaything. 
</P>
<P>
	For healthy Kurdish toddlers who fled Iraq, she recalled, it  
took little more than a week before they began suffering from 
malnutrition that could leave their developing brains permanently 
damaged. 
</P>
<P>
	In such humanitarian disasters, children require special  
physical and emotional care that too many ``otherwise heroic'' 
relief workers do not understand or know how to address, said 
Olness, a pediatrician with 30 years' experience in working with 
children who have escaped wars or natural disasters. 
</P>
<P>
	She has developed a new handbook of practical advice so relief  
workers can better protect youngsters' health. The guide, unveiled 
Sunday at a meeting of the American Academy of Pediatrics, is part 
of a campaign that beginning next year will send experts like 
Olness to disaster sites around the world to train relief workers. 
Funding the effort is the charitable Johnson &AMP; Johnson Pediatric 
Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	``Children are not little adults,'' said Olness, a Case Western  
Reserve University doctor. 
</P>
<P>
	Children become malnourished and dehydrated faster than adults,  
and are far more susceptible to disease. They also seem especially 
vulnerable to psychological trauma. 
</P>
<P>
	But, she said, research shows there are ways to mitigate the  
danger; some are fairly simple, such as recognizing a child's vital 
need for play or easy checks for malnutrition. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most often governments and others worry about the adults  
because those are the folks who complain. The kids tend to get 
lost,'' said Dr. Errol Alden of the pediatrics group. 
</P>
<P>
	As the number of humanitarian disasters has grown from about six  
a year in the 1980s to over 15 a year this decade, ``we've become 
more and more concerned,'' Alden said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those concerns:  
</P>
<P>
	--Even brief periods of severe malnutrition can damage a young  
child's brain, resulting in long-term learning disabilities or 
other problems. Even if a refugee camp seems to have adequate food, 
adults may steal unaccompanied children's share, and young children 
absorb nutrition in smaller doses so a once-a-day camp ration could 
still leave toddlers starving. 
</P>
<P>
	--Children's immature immune systems are vulnerable to disease.  
Lack of vitamin A from malnutrition increases chances of death from 
measles, which commonly sweeps through refugee camps. Children do 
not understand hygiene, easily spreading diarrheal diseases and 
playing in contaminated water supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	--Children may not be able to explain to relief workers if they  
have a lifethreatening food allergy. 
</P>
<P>
	--Children orphaned or separated from family suffer particular  
psychological trauma, and need protection from exploitation and 
abuse. In addition, youngsters ages of 7 to 12 are at a critical 
stage in learning the concepts of right and wrong. Displaced 
children without appropriate role models can grow up with a warped 
sense of morality. 
</P>
<P>
	Relief workers reading the Helping the Children handbooks --  
which will be available in several languages -- will learn that 
children and nursing mothers should get priority in distributing 
existing food. They will find advice on ways to figure how to 
preserve young children's rations for multiple feedings and on 
immunizing refugee children. 
</P>
<P>
	The handbook offers easy health exams to catch malnutrition  
early -- pressing a thumb against a child's foot for a few seconds 
to see if the skin properly bounces back is one example. 
</P>
<P>
	Olness says relief workers also must remember that little things  
such as bringing toys and providing children the security of a 
daily routine greatly relieve stress. She recalled giving Kosovo 
refugees paper and crayons, and they sat under a tree making 
therapeutic pictures of their experiences. 
</P>
<P>
	Such things ``may not seem like top priorities, but they can  
make a huge difference,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Industrial Area to Double </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- Jordan's largest duty-free industrial zone  
plans to double its capacity to meet demand from customers in the 
United States and Europe, an official said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Al-Hassan Qualified Industrial Zone comprises 83 companies  
and factories, employing 5,000 people. It will double its size 
early next year to keep up with customer requirements, QIZ 
director-general Mohammed Itmeh said. 
</P>
<P>
	The zone, located 54 miles north of the capital, Amman, near the  
city of Irbid, was established two years ago by Jordan-Israel joint 
ventures. Its products are exempt from U.S. taxes and customs 
duties. 
</P>
<P>
	Itmeh said that last year the QIZ exported and sold goods worth  
$507 million, 60 percent of which was sold to U.S. and European 
markets. Its products are mainly clothes, food, textiles, 
engineering goods, plastic, rubber, chemical products, and luggage.

<HEADLINE>  Yanks Dominating Like Last October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Since everything else the New York  
Yankees have done this year has been compared to 1998, it's only 
fair to point out these guys were as good if not better in the 
first round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The reigning World Series champions wrapped up their second  
straight first-round sweep of the Texas Rangers with a 3-0 victory 
Saturday night. New York allowed just one run in three games -- just 
like last year -- while scoring five more. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's incredible,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre said. ``Last year  
we did the same thing and I remember saying this was the toughest 
series for us because you don't want to go through this ballclub 
again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Best of all, they did it without playoff ace David Cone breaking  
a sweat. 
</P>
<P>
	Cone, who could use the extra rest, would've started Game 4  
against Texas. Instead, he'll likely pitch the opener of the AL 
championship series Wednesday night at Yankee Stadium against 
either Cleveland or Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're throwing the ball well, and our best money pitcher  
hasn't even come out of the bag yet,'' Game 3 winner Roger Clemens 
said. ``It'll be interesting to see what spark he gives us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York, which has won 10 straight postseason games, has used  
first-round victories over Texas as a springboard to World Series 
titles in 1996 and '98. 
</P>
<P>
	But the hunt for a third title in four years and 25th overall  
carries the added burden of following one of baseball's best teams 
ever. The '98 Yankees won 114 regular-season games and swept San 
Diego in the Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Although this team won 16 fewer games from April to October --  
the biggest falloff in the AL -- it still has a chance for a better 
postseason. Beating last year's 11-2 playoff run won't be easy, but 
sweeping Texas at least makes it possible. 
</P>
<P>
	``You see guys are just determined to get it done, whether it's  
going to get a ball or cut a ball off,'' Clemens said. ``That's 
what these games are about now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York pitchers controlled this series by shutting down Texas  
hitters. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers, who led the majors with a .293 average in the  
regular season, batted just .152, including 0-for-13 with runners 
in scoring position. They were shut out twice in three games after 
being blanked seven times in 162 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Starters Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez, Andy Pettitte and  
Clemens each went at least seven innings, and relievers Jeff Nelson 
and Mariano Rivera did the rest. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they would've shut out any team they faced,''  
shortstop Derek Jeter said. ``They were just on top of their game, 
hitting their spots and not letting anybody get on base.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees led 20 of the 27 innings this series thanks largely  
to improved hitting by Jeter and Bernie Williams. After going 
1-for-20 against Texas last year, the duo went 9-for-22 with six 
RBIs and five runs. 
</P>
<P>
	Both also came through in the field, especially Saturday. Jeter  
made a nice play to get the final out, and Williams chased down the 
three hardest-hit balls by the Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeter and Williams were on base in the first inning when Darryl  
Strawberry drove in the game's only runs with a two-out homer. 
</P>
<P>
	The drive awoke a lifeless New York dugout and left Texas facing  
a deficit it didn't have the confidence to overcome. 
</P>
<P>
	Pitching like a five-time Cy Young Award winner should, Clemens  
made the lead hold up by allowing just three singles in seven 
shutout innings. The Rangers reached second only once, and that 
threat ended on the next pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens' first postseason win since 1986 began making up for a  
mediocre regular season and reminded critical Yankees fans why he 
was acquired from Toronto in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this turns the page on everything that happened this  
year,'' Torre said. ``This is the pitcher we traded for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Almost overshadowed is the dramatic reversal by Strawberry, who  
this time last year only gave New York inspiration as he fought 
colon cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Having beaten the disease and endured another arrest and  
suspension, the king of comebacks said this homer ``probably is at 
the top of the list after all I've been through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great feeling,'' he said. ``This team is always  
accomplishing a lot. We play as a team, as hard as we can and we 
win. I think everybody appreciates what we've done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the Yankees and New York Mets both among the final four  
teams for the first time, the city already is abuzz over the chance 
for a Subway Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry, who has won a World Series with both teams, can only  
imagine the scene. 
</P>
<P>
	``You got to think, `How crazy will it be in New York?' '' he  
said ``As far as the fans and the rivals, Mets fans and Yankees 
fans, you wonder if the city can control that.''

<HEADLINE> Michigan State Fans Revel in Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- Exhilarated Michigan State fans  
celebrated their team's victory over Michigan without a major 
ruckus. 
</P>
<P>
	East Lansing police processed 41 people through city jail  
between 7 p.m. Saturday and 6 a.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would say it was a typical home-football night,'' said East  
Lansing police Lt. John Benson. ``It was busy but nothing 
horrendous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Spartans upset the visiting Wolverines, 34-31.  
</P>
<P>
	As of about 6 p.m. Saturday, police had issued about 150  
tickets, largely for minors possessing alcohol, disorderly conduct 
and public urination, state police Capt. Tony Kleibecker said. 
State police could not provide an updated figure Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, more than 125 people were charged in riots that  
followed the Michigan State basketball team's loss to Duke in the 
NCAA Final Four. The riots caused an estimated $238,000 in damages 
with eight cars torched and 24 windows broken in downtown 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Compared to that, it was a cakewalk,'' Benson said.  
</P>
<P>
	Michigan State campus police said there were arrests on campus,  
but would not release the number.

<HEADLINE> Tigers May Be Ready To Hire Garner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The Detroit Tigers are thought to have  
interviewed former Milwaukee manager Phil Garner in recent days 
about the possibility of leading their club into a new ballpark 
next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no comment on that,'' Tigers' general manager Randy  
Smith said Sunday night. ``This is a delicate subject right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garner, fired in August after eight years at Milwaukee, would  
replace Larry Parrish, who led the Tigers to a disappointing 69-92 
record during his first full season as a major league manager. That 
left them a distant third in the AL Central behind the Cleveland 
Indians and Chicago White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until a formal announcement is made, I can't comment on  
anything,'' Smith said. ``And I'm not saying there's going to be a 
formal announcement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith met last Monday with Tigers owner Mike Ilitch and club  
president and CEO John McHale Jr. The three discussed whether they 
would retain Parrish for another season. 
</P>
<P>
	McHale said after that meeting that no timetable had been set  
for a decision. He noted, however, that it was in everyone's best 
interest to have it done as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got together last Monday and agreed we'd say nothing about  
anything until we had something to announce,'' Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	Garner and Smith are thought to have met either Friday or  
Saturday. If the interview went well, it is possible an 
announcement could come early this week. 
</P>
<P>
	A message left at Garner's home by The Associated Press wasn't  
returned. Parrish, who returned to his home in Haines City, Fla., 
after the season ended, was on a hunting trip. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tigers, who got by on a lowly $35 million payroll this  
season, are expected to take a payroll in excess of $50 million 
next season into Comerica Park, a $300 million ballpark under 
construction about a mile from Tiger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	To manage that kind of investment, the Tigers might want someone  
with more experience than Parrish -- even if their record is no 
better than the one Parrish fashioned. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brewers fired Garner in the midst of the seventh straight  
losing season in his eight years in Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	Garner, like Parrish, could have been the victim of having to  
work with a small-market payroll. The situation in Milwaukee, like 
Detroit, was made worse by some poor personnel decisions by the 
front office. 
</P>
<P>
	Garner's best season was his first, 1992, before the payroll gap  
between clubs got extreme. That season, he almost guided the 
Brewers past Toronto for the AL East title. Milwaukee now plays in 
the NL Central. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Tigers are determined to dump Parrish and don't hire  
Garner, there are other candidates out there. They could include 
Atlanta batting coach Don Baylor or Jim Riggleman, fired last 
Monday by the Chicago Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith knows and likes Riggleman. In 1993, Riggleman managed the  
San Diego Padres when Smith became the club's GM in mid-season. 
Riggleman left the Padres after that season for the Cubs, where he 
had two winning seasons in five years.

<HEADLINE> Oregon Wine Outlook Said Promising / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUNDEE, Ore. (AP) -- After a shaky start, things are looking good  
this year for Oregon's wine grape crop, and observers say it's a 
pretty sight indeed. 
</P>
<P>
	Unblemished fruit hangs swollen on the vine, soaking up sunshine  
that started late but now is working overtime. Picking has begun in 
some regions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a miracle September,'' said Allen Holstein, vineyard  
manager for Argyle Winery. ``That saved our bacon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the start of September, growers were worried. The season was  
late and hopes for warm, dry weather weren't high. Vineyards 
bustled with workers thinning the grape clusters, so the fruit that 
remained on the vine would fully ripen. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's harvest was 14,700 tons. This year's estimate is for  
17,000 tons, and some predict it could be more. 
</P>
<P>
	Holstein said the yields would have been better yet had growers  
not thinned when they did, in expectation of a late harvest under 
cooler, wetter conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Oregon has about 8,000 bearing acres of wine grapes and about  
9,000 additional acres planted. The most widely grown varietal 
remains pinot noir with chardonnay No. 2, followed by pinot gris. 
</P>
<P>
	Brad Biehl, director of viticulture for King Estate Winery in  
Eugene, said, ``The fruit is spotlessly clean. Pests? Disease? 
There's absolutely none. Zero. We're set up for a really good 
year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prices, particularly for pinot noir, are princely. Oregon's  
premier wine grape commands anywhere from $1,450 to $2,000 or more 
a ton. The grape does especially well here, in France's Burgundy 
district and on the California coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Biehl said Pinot gris has brought $1,250 a ton for the past two  
years. He estimated King Estate will harvest 600 tons of Pinot gris 
and 500 tons of pinot noir. 
</P>
<P>
	The Oregon Wine Advisory Board put the number of wineries in the  
state at 136 and vineyards at 383. 
</P>
<P>
	The growth even startles those steeped in the industry, such as  
Ed Hellman, Oregon State University district extension agent. He 
sees new names and labels popping up everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
	``There're a lot of new ones going in and most existing  
vineyards are expanding,'' Hellman said. ``We're still definitely 
in a growth phase, and if anything, it looks like it's 
accelerating.'' 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	WICHITA, Kan. (AP) -- Kansas farmers are expected to harvest a  
record 405.6 million pounds of sunflowers this fall, Kansas 
Agricultural Statistics says. 
</P>
<P>
	That would make this fall's crop 52 percent bigger than last  
year. 
</P>
<P>
	In its monthly crop estimate, KAS reported Friday that Kansas  
growers planted 85,000 more acres into sunflowers this year, 
bringing the total harvested acreage to 260,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunflower yields are also expected to be up 2 percent from a  
year ago, with an anticipated average of 1,560 pounds per acre.

<HEADLINE> Lauer Wishes Gumbel Good Luck </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- NBC ``Today'' host Matt Lauer is wishing the  
best for his morning show predecessor-turned-rival Bryant Gumbel. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant will be co-hosting CBS's new ``Early Show,'' set to debut  
at 7 a.m. on Nov. 1 from a new storefront studio in the General 
Motors building across from Central Park. Jane Clayson will be 
Gumbel's co-host. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love the guy,'' Lauer said in the Oct. 16 issue of TV Guide.  
``I want nothing but the best for him. I know he feels the same for 
me. I know he's going to put on a quality show. Other than that, 
what can I say except we both have a job to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not everyone is feeling neighborly toward Gumbel and his new  
show. In September, a posh Fifth Avenue hotel went to court in a 
bid to stop CBS from using the plaza in front of the General Motors 
Building for the ``Early Show,'' citing potential annoyances.

<HEADLINE> N.J. Wins Qtr. of Brennan Income </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Calling the disgraced penny-stock tycoon a  
``big crook,'' a Superior Court judge ordered Robert Brennan to pay 
25 percent of his income to the state. 
</P>
<P>
	The amount, which Brennan's bankruptcy attorney argued was  
excessive, will go toward paying the $45 million Brennan owes from 
a settlement of stock fraud charges reached earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why is that excessive?'' Superior Court Judge Philip M.  
Freedman asked on Friday. ``I mean, this man spent $3,000 in a 
liquor store last month.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Looking over a state-supplied list of Brennan's ``lifestyle  
expenditures'' for June and July -- the list includes a $2,829.10 at 
the Spring Lake Bottle Shop; more than $1,900 in fees at three golf 
courses; and $586.71 at Brielle Florist -- Freedman continued, ``The 
only bill I see here that the average person pays is a payment to 
Allstate Insurance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brennan did not appear in court on Friday. Messages that were  
left for his attorney, Gerald H. Gline, and for Brennan at the Due 
Process Golf Club on Saturday were not immediately returned. 
</P>
<P>
	According to court documents, Brennan earns about $388,000 per  
year as a consultant at the Due Process Golf Club in Colts Neck. 
The property, now a golf course, is owned in a partnership between 
Brennan and his three adult sons. 
</P>
<P>
	The state had filed a motion this week to recoup some of the $45  
million Brennan owes from the settlement he signed in June with the 
state Bureau of Securities to avoid a criminal trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The money is to compensate the investors state regulators  
believe Brennan swindled. In the settlement, Brennan denied 
wrongdoing, but consented to a finding that he used ``substantial 
influence'' at two brokerages to make ``unreasonably excessive 
profits'' in low-cost stocks in which he held an undisclosed 
interest from 1988-95. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to granting New Jersey's request for a quarter of  
Brennan's income, Freedman also said he will grant the state 
$18,000 from one of Brennan's bank accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Brennan, 56, became nationally known in the 1980s through  
television commercials for his First Jersey Securities Inc. in 
which he stepped from a helicopter and told investors to ``come 
grow with us.'' The company has been inactive since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	He declared bankruptcy in 1995, when a federal judge in New York  
ruled that he cheated First Jersey investors and ordered him to pay 
what is now more than $78 million to the Securities and Exchange 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	But despite the bankruptcy and judgments against him, Freedman  
said Brennan ``still lives at a standard of living that any other 
person, other than a few, would be happy to have.''

	Bosnian Serbs May Withdraw Lawsuit  
</P>
<P>
	BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) -- The Bosnian Serb Assembly  
on Sunday endorsed a proposal to withdraw a lawsuit against 
Yugoslavia for aggression and genocide in connection with the 
1992-95 ethnic war here. The case was filed by the Sarajevo 
government six years ago in the World Court in The Hague. At the 
time, the government was Muslim-dominated. Now, the Bosnian Serbs 
want to withdraw the suit.

	GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- Russia is expected to reject several key  
points of Chechnya President Aslan Maskhadov's proposed peace plan 
brought forth Sunday to end the fighting in his breakaway republic. 
Russia did not respond immediately, but will likely reject the 
withdrawal of Russian forces, which entered Chechnya two weeks ago. 
Maskhadov said the two sides should observe the basic principles of 
a peace accord that ended the 1994-96 Checen war.

	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- A grass-roots conservative Republican  
organization today failed to agree on which GOP presidential 
candidate it would endorse. The first National Federation of 
Republican Assemblies convention ended with a vote in which 
publisher Steve Forbes got 164 votes, or 62.4 percent, with Pat 
Buchanan getting 99 votes, or 37.6 percent. But Forbes fell short

the New York Knicks decided to bench him for their first exhibition 
game. Sprewell said he had simply ignored the Knicks' phone 
messages as he drove across the country, doing a 36-hour stretch 
solo from Oakland to Milwaukee. As for ignoring calls from the 
Knicks, who were wondering what he was doing, he said, ``That's 
what agents are for.''

<HEADLINE> Czech Premier: Breakup a Mistake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) -- Czech Premier Milos Zeman says the  
1993 breakup of Czechoslovakia was an ``irreversible mistake,'' the 
newspaper Lidove Noviny reported in its weekend edition. 
</P>
<P>
	The Czechoslovak federation broke up peacefully on Jan 1, 1993,  
after Slovakia demanded more autonomy from the federal capital in 
Prague. Known as the ``velvet divorce,'' it was the subject of 
bitter debate not only between the two sides but also within the 
Czech and Slovak areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Zeman, who criticized the split at the time, met with Slovak  
Premier Mikolas Dzurinda in Prague on Thursday. He said the 
complicated process of working out a financial settlement should be 
final by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	There is little friction over the issue today, but looking back,  
Zeman called the breakup a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a decision that cannot be taken back and despite that I  
call it a mistake ... a mistake that is irreversible,'' he told the 
paper. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether the Czech Republic and its people would be better  
off in a still-federal Czechoslovakia, Zeman said, ``from a 
geopolitical point of view that is certainly so,'' but added that 
he supported Slovakia's membership in NATO as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
	When the nations were splitting, Zeman had sought a confederal  
arrangement that both the Czech and Slovak governments considered 
unfeasible.

<HEADLINE> Patricia Neal Loves Sci-Fi Classic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Patricia Neal says she watched herself in the  
1951 science-fiction classic ``The Day the Earth Stood Still'' for 
the first time on a wide screen Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``This reminds me of the Oscars. I love it!'' the 73-year-old  
Academy Award-winning actress told the cheering crowd that gathered 
at Omaha's Indian Hills Theater, which has a 70-foot screen. 
</P>
<P>
	The celebrity screening was a benefit for a local child advocacy  
organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Former child star Billy Gray, who played Neal's son in the film  
and later starred in the television series ``Father Knows Best'' as 
Bud, escorted Neal to the show. 
</P>
<P>
	One of her many fans, Ron Barta, told Neal: ``You still have the  
sexiest voice I've ever heard.'' 
</P>

	``Thank you, dear,'' Neal replied. ``Keep spreading that  
rumor.''

<HEADLINE> Commercial Satellite Reaches Orbit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- A Ukrainian-Russian rocket carrying a  
U.S. satellite roared off a launch platform in the Pacific, the 
first commercial liftoff for the Sea Launch Co., an international 
consortium led by Boeing. 
</P>
<P>
	The 200-foot-tall Zenit-3SL rocket rose off the oceangoing  
platform late Saturday at a point near the equator, carrying the 
7,600-pound satellite for DirecTV. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was beautiful,'' said Anne Eisele, a Boeing spokeswoman who  
watched from Sea Launch headquarters in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	The self-propelled launch pad, accompanied by a support ship, is  
a former oil drilling platform. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the Earth moves faster at the equator, rockets launched  
there have an advantage in reaching orbit with heavier payloads. 
</P>
<P>
	The DirecTV satellite reached geosynchronous orbit, one that  
keeps it over the same place on Earth, about 62 minutes after 
liftoff. 
</P>
<P>
	Sea Launch has orders for 19 more launches through 2003.  
</P>
<P>
	The company's partners are Boeing Commercial Space Co. of Kent,  
Wash.; Norwegian ship builder Kvaerner Maritime; Russia's RSC 
Energia, and Ukrainian rocket maker KB Yuzhnoye/PO Yuzhmash. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ukrainian company provides the first two stages of the  
rocket and Energia builds the upper stage. Boeing performs the 
spacecraft integration.

<HEADLINE> Battle Brews Over Slot Machines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARSON CITY, Nev. (AP) -- When it comes to gambler-enticing  
graphics and animation on slot machines, state regulators say 
cartoon flirt Betty Boop might be OK -- but a ``South Park'' theme 
is just too kid-friendly. 
</P>
<P>
	So Nevada officials are considering a rule to ban artwork based  
on cartoons, comic strip superheroes or other images that suggest 
slots are child's play. 
</P>
<P>
	While some slot makers say it's a Mickey Mouse idea, Gaming  
Control Board Chairman Steve DuCharme says the plan stems from 
genuine concern over marketing that goes too far in targeting 
minors. 
</P>
<P>
	``The manufacturers have been reporting to us that they've been  
seeking licensing arrangements for various cartoon characters -- 
Saturday morning cartoon characters that no adult I know watches,'' 
said DuCharme. ``I don't know how you justify having a Saturday 
morning cartoon character as your theme on a gaming device.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We think developing a new customer base is fine -- as long as  
they're all over 21 years of age,'' DuCharme said. Twenty-one is 
the legal age to gamble in Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
	Themed slots aren't new. Some already in casinos feature  
graphics or animation based on Monopoly, Yahtzee, Elvis Presley and 
1930s icon Betty Boop. 
</P>
<P>
	New slots in the works are based on the Pink Panther, ``I Dream  
of Jeannie,'' ``The Munsters,'' ``The Three Stooges'' and other TV 
or movie hits. There's even one slot topped by a dancing toy 
chicken. Others have full-size heads of Lurch and Uncle Fester from 
``The Addams Family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DuCharme started thinking about a limit on slot themes when he  
saw a proposed machine based on ``South Park'' cartoon characters. 
He also fretted about suggested devices that featured comic book 
superheroes. 
</P>
<P>
	All slot machine designs must be approved by the three-member  
Gaming Control Board. Until now, themes haven't been a big issue, 
and new game approvals typically have taken only a few minutes out 
of lengthy agendas at monthly public meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	Without a uniform standard on slot themes, DuCharme said the  
board and its testing laboratory must make case-by-case 
determinations on each slot concept that's presented. The lab 
staffers' main job is to check out inner workings of slots to 
ensure the games give players a chance to win and aren't vulnerable 
to cheaters. 
</P>
<P>
	With a standard, ``it doesn't fall on the lab manager or one  
person on the Control Board to say 'I think Mr. Magoo is OK but I 
think Teletubbies is not OK' -- without some way of articulating 
what the difference is,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian McKay of Reno-based International Game Technology, the  
world's leading slot manufacturer, is against the board's proposal, 
which is to be discussed at a hearing in Las Vegas on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I won't say it's ridiculous,'' McKay said. ``But there's no  
need for such a regulation because the Control Board already has 
the authority to OK any game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``And our games are not designed for children by definition,''  
McKay adds. ``Slot machines are designed, developed and marketed 
for adults.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed regulation is pitting more than just the industry  
types against the regulators. There are also some differences among 
members of the Nevada Gaming Commission, which will have final say 
on any rule that the Control Board approves. 
</P>
<P>
	While a majority of the commission favored the board's plan for  
hearings on the proposed regulation, Commissioner Augie Gurrola is 
against the idea. He agrees with the industry argument that the 
state already has the power to reject any slot motif that is deemed 
unsuitable. 
</P>
<P>
	IGT pulled back its ``South Park'' slot because of the Control  
Board's concerns, but is going ahead with other concepts such as 
``The Addams Family'' slot, subject to a final endorsement from the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooke Dunn of Las Vegas-based Shuffle Master, currently testing  
its Three Stooges slot, thinks that regulators should avoid what 
could turn into a drawn-out process of setting standards for slot 
themes. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a Mickey Mouse regulation because it's not  
necessary,'' Dunn said. ``This is a very competitive market these 
days. If it's not geared to adults, if it doesn't fit an adult 
image, they're not going to play the game and it won't stay on the 
casino floor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dunn also questions why slot machines are singled out. He says  
major hotel-casinos in Las Vegas are not hassled because of their 
use of themes designed, in part, to bring in families. 
</P>
<P>
	``What about the big clown that's been in front of Circus Circus  
for 25 years? What about Treasure Island? Isn't that a children's 
story?'' he asked. ``What about the MGM and its Wizard of Oz theme? 
Lions and tigers and bears, oh my!''

<HEADLINE> Surprise Starts Dot NHL Landscape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Vancouver Canucks are playing like they're trying to make up  
for the last few years. Same for the San Jose Sharks and Florida 
Panthers. 
</P>
<P>
	Topped by the Canucks' 3-0 record, those three are among the  
team surprises after the first week of the NHL season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's time to get a little bit excited,'' coach Mark Crawford  
said after Vancouver's 4-1 win over Montreal on Saturday night gave 
the Canucks their best start since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to get carried away with ourselves. We know  
we've got a long way to go. ... But right now, the confidence can 
keep building for us if we continue to adhere to what we're 
doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Canucks have reason to feel good about themselves these  
days. They've missed the playoffs for three straight years and have 
been at the bottom of the Western Conference two seasons in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	Their 3-0 start is one win short of their best in franchise  
history. The Canucks' three-game winning streak is also their 
longest since February 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's only three games in, but we've been playing really hard.  
We've bought into a system and we've got to keep on riding it,'' 
Todd Bertuzzi said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sharks and Panthers both feel pretty good, too, after strong  
starts. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sharks began the season with three straight victories for  
the first time in their history before losing 3-2 to defending 
Stanley Cup champion Dallas on Saturday night. The Panthers are 
2-0-1 after Saturday night's 2-2 tie with the Detroit Red Wings. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sharks, who finished seventh in the Western Conference last  
year, have never had a winning season in their eight years in the 
NHL. The Panthers, Stanley Cup finalists in 1996, have missed the 
playoffs for two straight seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday night's performance was a gutsy effort by the Panthers,  
who rallied from a 2-0 deficit to tie one of the NHL's tougher 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``Getting down 2-0 to one of the premier teams in the league and  
certainly one of the best defensive teams, I'm very happy to come 
back and tie this thing,'' Panthers coach Terry Murray said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles Kings are another team trying to forget the  
past, and doing a pretty good job of it. They're at 3-1-1 in the 
midst of a seven-game road trip to start the season, including a 
2-2 tie Saturday night at Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kings missed the playoffs last season for the fifth time in  
six years, including last year when they went 32-45-5. 
</P>
<P>
	``We talked about calling this a good trip if we won tonight,''  
said Kings coach Andy Murray. ``Now it goes a step below a great 
trip but a few steps above a good trip.''

<HEADLINE> Gasoline Prices Dip Half a Cent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Gasoline prices dipped about half a cent  
nationwide over the past two weeks as crude oil prices took a dive, 
an industry analyst said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The weighted average nationwide as of Friday was $1.3288, down  
.53 cents per gallon from a Sept. 24 survey, said Trilby Lundberg, 
director of the Lundberg survey of 10,000 gasoline stations across 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The drop in gas prices follows a climb of more than 14 cents per  
gallon that started in early June, Lundberg said. The main reason 
for the decrease at the pump was the $4 per barrel decrease in 
crude oil price, Lundberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Crude oil prices may have risen too fast and too soon for  
global demand,'' Lundberg said. ``It's impossible to say where it 
will go from here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The price for a barrel of crude oil was $25 two weeks ago on the  
New York Mercantile Exchange, Lundberg said, but it is now less 
than $21 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lundberg survey showed a national average price for self  
service regular unleaded gasoline of $1.2777. Mid-grade unleaded 
was $1.3756 and premium unleaded was $1.4602. 
</P>
<P>
	For full service regular unleaded, the survey showed the average  
price was $1.6153 with mid-grade at $1.7008 and premium at $1.7753.

<HEADLINE> Officials Discuss Chinese WTO Entry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- Top trade officials from China and the European  
Union on Sunday discussed China's bid to join the World Trade 
Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Pascal Lamy, the new EU trade commissioner, said after the  
meeting that he hopes EU-Chinese trade negotiations will now 
resume. He gave no date, though. 
</P>
<P>
	Discussions were suspended after NATO's May 7 bombing of the  
Chinese Embassy in Belgrade during the alliance's air war on 
Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Lamy's meeting with Chinese Foreign Trade Minister Shi  
Guangsheng, on the sidelines of an EU-Asia trade ministers 
conference, underlined both sides' interest in a new push to get 
China into the world trade body. 
</P>
<P>
	But several ministers made plain that China's goal to join  
before a new round of world trade talks starts Nov. 30 is probably 
unrealistic. 
</P>
<P>
	``My hunch is that it might be difficult,'' said Thai trade  
minister Supachai Panitchpakdi. 
</P>
<P>
	In that case, China should be admitted to the round as an  
observer, said Supachai, designated as the WTO's next 
director-general. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States and the 15-nation EU are pushing for more  
market-opening moves by China before backing its membership bid, 
which requires approval of all 134 WTO nations. 
</P>
<P>
	EU officials say the bloc particularly wants cuts in Chinese  
tariffs on automobiles, ceramics, textiles and glass products as 
well as greater opening in retailing and financial services. 
</P>
<P>
	China has been trying to join the group for 13 years. Last week,  
China and the United States made little apparent progress on 
China's WTO bid in their first substantial negotiations since May. 
</P>
<P>
	At the two-day Berlin talks, ministers from the EU and 10 Asian  
nations remained at odds over demands from rich countries to 
discuss labor standards and environmental rules for developing 
nations in the new round. 
</P>
<P>
	Some developing countries see such rules as a way by rich  
nations to protect their industries against cheaper competition, 
particularly from the Far East. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be a big problem,'' Supachai said. ``Several  
developing countries have expressed the view that if the word 
'labor' is mentioned, they would walk out of the meeting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Such proposals could be discussed, however, if they are  
``presented in a way that is not binding.''

<HEADLINE>  Commercial Satellite Reaches Orbit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- A Ukrainian-Russian rocket carrying a  
U.S. satellite roared off a launch platform in the Pacific, the 
first commercial liftoff for the Sea Launch Co., an international 
consortium led by Boeing. 
</P>
<P>
	The 200-foot-tall Zenit-3SL rocket rose off the oceangoing  
platform late Saturday at a point near the equator, carrying the 
7,600-pound satellite for DirecTV. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was beautiful,'' said Anne Eisele, a Boeing spokeswoman who  
watched from Sea Launch headquarters in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	The self-propelled launch pad, accompanied by a support ship, is  
a former oil drilling platform. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the Earth moves faster at the equator, rockets launched  
there have an advantage in reaching orbit with heavier payloads. 
</P>
<P>
	The DirecTV satellite reached geosynchronous orbit, one that  
keeps it over the same place on Earth, about 62 minutes after 
liftoff. 
</P>
<P>
	Sea Launch has orders for 19 more launches through 2003.  
</P>
<P>
	The company's partners are Boeing Commercial Space Co. of Kent,  
Wash.; Norwegian ship builder Kvaerner Maritime; Russia's RSC 
Energia, and Ukrainian rocket maker KB Yuzhnoye/PO Yuzhmash. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ukrainian company provides the first two stages of the  
rocket and Energia builds the upper stage. Boeing performs the 
spacecraft integration.

<HEADLINE> BBC Can't Air George Michael Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- George Michael refused to let the British  
Broadcasting Corp. air footage from his NetAid performance after 
technical glitches marred his show. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael was among dozens of performers to appear at three  
overlapping fundraising concerts Saturday in London, Geneva and New 
Jersey. The events were organized by the United Nations Development 
Program and broadcast live on the Internet, where viewers were 
encouraged to donate money to help the world's impoverished. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael's show at London's Wembley Stadium was blighted by  
technical problems that led him to prohibit the BBC from showing 
any part of his performance when the network screened concert 
segments, said Andy Stephens, Michael's manager. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would love to have shown it to his fans, as we are  
completely satisfied with it, and we are disappointed that we were 
not allowed to use it,'' a BBC spokesman said, speaking with 
customary anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephens said the technical glitches may be able to be patched  
up for future broadcasts.

</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Sir Nigel Broackes, former chairman of engineering  
conglomerate Trafalgar House and the man who began the rejuvenation 
of London's Docklands district, died Sept. 28. He was 65. 
</P>
<P>
	No cause of death was given.  
</P>
<P>
	Using a legacy from his grandfather, Broackes dabbled in  
property development, initially with little success. But he used 
his last asset, a small apartment block, to gain control of a new 
company, Trafalgar House, and built it into a world leader in 
technology-based engineering services and international 
construction. He served first as managing director, then as 
chairman from 1969-92. He was knighted in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Trafalgar House has annual sales of more than $4 billion,  
has 28,000 employees and owns the Cunard cruise line and London's 
Ritz Hotel.

	PALM HARBOR, Fla. (AP) -- Manfredo Fest, a jazz pianist and a  
pioneer of the Brazilian bossa nova movement that swept the world 
in the 1960s, died Friday while awaiting a liver transplant. He was 
63. 
</P>
<P>
	Fest, a native of Brazil, had lived in the Tampa Bay area since  
1987. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics credit Fest and other musicians such as Joao Gilberto,  
Antonio Carlos Jobim and Luiz Bonfa with helping revolutionize 
Brazilian and international pop music by refining bossa nova from 
samba in the early 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	He arrived in this country in 1967 and set about developing a  
blend of Brazilian and American jazz. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important to have a trademark,'' Fest said in 1997. ``If  
I came to the United States to play American jazz, I'd be only one 
more in the crowd.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Legally blind since birth, he worked for two years as arranger  
and keyboard player for Sergio Mendes' Brazil 66. He also played 
with Lee Ritenour and Floria Purim.

	MESA, Ariz. (AP) -- Dwight W. Patterson, a rancher and civil  
leader responsible for bringing the Chicago Cubs spring training 
camp to the Phoenix area, died Friday. He was 87 
</P>
<P>
	Patterson served on the city's junior chamber of commerce and  
became the first ``chief'' of the HoHoKams service organization, 
which guaranteed the Cubs $22,000 if they came to Mesa for spring 
training in 1951, then arranged for the Cubs to play at Rendezvous 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
	With the exception of one spring in California and a handful in  
Scottsdale, the Cubs have trained in Mesa ever since. The team 
attracted 176,000 fans to their camp last spring.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Lee Richardson, an American actor in stage, film  
and television work noted for his English accent, died Oct. 2 of 
cardiac arrest after complications from a perforated ulcer. He was 
73. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson was a fixture on the New York stage and in regional  
repertory roles for more than 40 years. He was born in Chicago but 
performed in so many roles with an English accent that he was 
widely assumed to be British. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson read the works of Shakespeare and Noel Coward as a  
soldier in the Army Air Corps during World War II. He moved to the 
Goodman Theater School in Chicago after the war. 
</P>
<P>
	By 1954, he was appearing regularly on the television drama  
anthologies ``Playhouse 90'' and ``Studio One.'' He performed with 
George C. Scott in Central Park in the 1962 production of ``The 
Merchant of Venice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He later became a founding member of the Guthrie Theater in  
Minneapolis, working with Jessica Tandy, Hume Cronyn and Rita Gam, 
among others. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson was nominated for a Tony Award in 1973 for his  
performance in ``Vivat! Vivat Regina!'' and appeared in John 
Huston's ``Prizzi's Honor.''

<P>
	GLASTONBURY, Conn. (AP) -- Robert Waite, a Williams College  
historian who brought the psychoanalytic approach to books about 
Hitler, died Oct. 4. He was 80. 
</P>
<P>
	Waite was one of the first proponents of analyzing events in  
Hitler's early life in Freudian terms to explain his behavior later 
in life. His most influential book was ``The Psychopathic God: 
Adolf Hitler'' (1977). 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe that the career of Adolf Hitler raises questions  
that can be answered neither by psychology nor by history working 
alone,'' Waite said in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
	Waite collected everything he could about Hitler's psychological  
behavior and pulled it together in a single study, said Robert Jay 
Lifton, a psychiatry professor at the Graduate Center of the City 
University of New York. 
</P>
<P>
	But Waite was criticized for undervaluing external influences  
such as European history, Christian anti-Semitism and ideology in 
explaining Hitler. Some of the evidence presented and analyzed by 
Waite, including claims about Hitler's sexual preferences and an 
autopsy report that Hitler had only one testicle, were suspect, 
critics have said.

</P>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Martin Bartner, the publisher of The  
Star-Ledger who helped the newspaper expand into the state's 
largest during his 46-year career there, died Sunday at his home in 
Verona. He was 69. 
</P>
<P>
	The paper did not release the cause of death.  
</P>
<P>
	Bartner, who began working at the paper part time as a  
teen-ager, eventually rose to director of advertising, then was 
named associate publisher in 1980 and publisher in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a remarkable man. In rough times, faced with great  
challenges, he exuded optimism, helping us to carry forward,'' said 
Donald E. Newhouse, president of The Star-Ledger. ``In the best of 
times, he was modest and unassuming, giving credit for successes to 
his associates.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Born in Newark on Aug. 11, 1930, Bartner was an only child whose  
parents owned a small, dry goods store. While attending Belleville 
High School, he became The Star-Ledger's student correspondent, 
calling in sports scores for 10 cents per column inch. 
</P>
<P>
	After graduating from New York University, where he majored in  
journalism, Bartner returned to The Ledger to cover sports full 
time. But by 1951, married and planning a family, Bartner switched 
from reporting for what was then regarded as ``a racing and scandal 
sheet'' to advertising -- his true calling. 
</P>
<P>
	Following a two-year stint in the Army, Bartner returned to The  
Star-Ledger in 1955 and was sent to its sister paper, the Jersey 
Journal. After several promotions in the advertising department, he 
went back to The Ledger in 1965 as manager of classified ads. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Willse, who became editor of The Star-Ledger four years ago,  
recalled Bartner as ``the best publisher an editor could ask for, 
and a great friend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include his wife, Audrey; a son, Douglas; a daughter,  
Lisa Coleman; and three grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
	Funeral services will be held Monday at Temple B'nai Jeshurun in  
Short Hills. Interment will follow at the Beth David Memorial Park 
in Kenilworth.

<HEADLINE> Penn State Looks for Improvement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) -- Indiana has been dealt with. Iowa has  
been tossed aside. Now it starts getting serious for Penn State in 
the Big Ten. 
</P>
<P>
	A 31-7 victory over Iowa on Saturday got the No. 2-ranked  
Nittany Lions warmed up for what's ahead, starting with Ohio State 
next Saturday at home. They also have games left with Purdue, 
Michigan and Michigan State, along with Illinois and Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	That's a tough stretch and it comes after Penn State (6-0  
overall, 2-0 Big Ten) had trouble putting away an Iowa team that's 
last in the league in offense and looked helpless a week earlier in 
a 49-3 loss at Michigan State. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a lot to work on still,'' quarterback Kevin Thompson  
said. ``Every week, no matter how good we win or how much we win 
by, we're always going to have something we're going to work on and 
focus on the following week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There's plenty to focus on with what's coming up. At Iowa (1-4,  
0-2), Penn State led only 14-7 midway through the third quarter. It 
took a 47-yard touchdown run by Eric McCoo, a goal line stand and a 
key penalty for the Nittany Lions to break it open. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to get better -- a lot better -- and quick,''  
linebacker LaVar Arrington said. 
</P>
<P>
	Penn State did run the ball better than it has all year, rushing  
for 341 yards, but it wasn't until the fourth quarter that the 
Nittany Lions had success running straight ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	Before that, they got most of their yardage on McCoo's run,  
Eddie Drummond's 68-yard touchdown run on a reverse and No. 2 
quarterback Rashard Casey's scrambling. McCoo finished with 130 
yards on 13 carries. Casey had 65 yards in eight attempts. 
</P>
<P>
	``We ran the same plays we've been running,'' McCoo said. ``We  
just executed better. I got more yardage. I ran more. There were 
bigger holes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other than two interceptions and a missed field goal, Penn State  
coach Joe Paterno found little to harp about. 
</P>
<P>
	``Against Michigan State, they got behind so fast, it was 21-0,  
10 minutes into the game,'' Paterno said. ``They didn't get a 
chance to show much. So it was tough to figure out what we were 
going to get. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew they had a couple of good backs. I thought their  
quarterback played a heck of a football game. I kept telling our 
guys, `He's going to throw one to us, he's going to throw one to 
us' and he didn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Iowa quarterback Randy Reiners completed 18-of-30 passes for 192  
yards and a touchdown with no interceptions. He was sacked four 
times. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's about time,'' said Penn State linebacker Brandon Short.  
``We started getting some of that pressure like we used to get back 
in the good old days. I think we confused them a little bit with 
our blitzes. We ran a few different things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Short made a big play when he hauled Reiners down by the ankle  
on fourth-and-goal at the Penn State 2-yard line on the first play 
of the fourth quarter. A touchdown would have cut the lead to 
21-14. 
</P>
<P>
	``Overall I'm pleased,'' Paterno said. ``I think that was a good  
win for us.''

<HEADLINE> Intranet Links Colo. Telecommunity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Beginning next spring, Jon Lowry will be able to  
wake up, switch on his computer and get the results of last night's 
neighborhood Little League game. 
</P>
<P>
	He also could get a reminder about his turn for the car pool,  
check out a library book or even send a request to the area 
pharmacist to refill his prescription. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowry is a resident of one of the nation's first  
telecommunities, which links businesses, residents, schools and 
government offices via an intranet system, a computer Web site 
available to a smaller number of users. 
</P>
<P>
	The community's high-speed telecommunications system already  
allows Lowry, 51, an Advanced Digital Information Corp. executive, 
to work from home, transferring data at nearly 100 times the speed 
of a regular modem. Eventually, he will be able do video 
conferencing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great,'' Lowry said. ``When I do work from home, it  
certainly has made me more productive. No more dial-up, no more 
messing with the modem or having to wait to get connected. I log in 
once, and then I'm online all day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The telecommunity has been constructed on property at a former  
Air Force base in eastern Denver that coincidentally shares Lowry's 
name. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 200 homes are connected to a digital broadband  
fiber-to-the-curb network and, within the next five years to seven 
years, 4,000 homes and apartments will be connected to the 
Intranet. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowry also will link an office park, several schools and  
businesses to the intranet, allowing people to manage much of their 
lives from home. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Frieden, a telecommunications professor at Penn State  
University, expects to see an increase in fiber optic cable 
installation, particularly in high-income areas and new 
developments. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just like shared-tenant services or intelligent office parks,  
telecommunities are an attempt to carve out a competitive advantage 
in real estate,'' said Robert Frieden, a professor of 
telecommunications at Penn State University. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowry is one of at least seven telecommunities nationwide, with  
dozens more ready to be launched. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the first, Celebration, was built by Disney three years  
ago and is 30 minutes outside of Orlando, Fla. More than 700 homes 
are already connected and students this fall are e-mailing their 
homework to teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Reiman, president of the Broadband Group, a consulting firm,  
said the idea of including advanced home wiring in initial 
architectural plans is winning converts slowly. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't believe phone and cable companies are necessary  
innovative ... so we are pushing the envelope,'' he said. ``One 
reason is because most network providers never anticipate the type 
of appetite for high bandwidth services that our communities 
demonstrate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The amenities come with no additional investment to the  
homeowner, and are provided by U S West -- in the case of Lowry -- 
Cox Communications and AT&AMP;T. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Dresch, director of telecommunications market analysis for  
J.D. Power Associates in Westport, Conn., said from the standpoint 
of telecom companies there are several benefits to getting involved 
early. 
</P>
<P>
	``Customers are prone to purchase multiple services from a  
single provider, mostly out of convenience,'' he said. ``They 
prefer to receive a single bill, and to deal with one company when 
they have problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With technology advancing at such a rapid rate, a house equipped  
with conventional television, phone and electrical wiring is 
obsolete, said Anthony Moiso, president and chief executive officer 
of Rancho Mission Viejo, a 4,000-acre Ladera Ranch community in 
Orange County, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	In-home structured wiring has been added to the design  
guidelines for every home to be built at the development. It will 
enable residents to watch a videotape of satellite program from 
multiple televisions throughout the house and to centralize all 
computers to one printer, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Imagine ... using security sensors to monitor and control home  
lighting or temperature settings via the Internet,'' he said. 
``That's the potential benefit of advanced home wiring.''

	Schroeder's Party Recovers in Berlin Vote  
</P>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's Social Democrats  
recovered from a string of losses and held their own in local 
elections Sunday, ensuring that the party would retain a stable 
minority in Berlin's local government. The ballot also marked a 
triumph for incumbent mayor Eberhard Diepgen, who was certain to be 
appointed to a fourth term after a strong vote for the conservative 
Christian Democrats. At a time when Schroeder's austerity plans 
have unsettled Germans, Berliners appeared to opt for the more 
reassuring figure.

	Anger Grows in Flooded Mexican City  
</P>
<P>
	VILLAHERMOSA, Mexico (AP) -- Angry over sandbagging that has  
swamped their neighborhoods and furious that the government hasn't 
done more to help, hundreds of people in Tabasco's flooded capital 
clashed today with police, who beat and arrested many of them. 
President Ernesto Zedillo, who has called the flooding Mexico's 
worst disaster in a decade, toured the stricken areas on Friday and 
yesterday and pledged to send more civilian and military personnel 
to help the victims throughout states along the Gulf of Mexico.

	N. Korea Denounces US Missile Test  
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- North Korea denounced the United  
States today for testing a defense missile system over the Pacific, 
and vowed to build up its own defense capabilities. ``This (the 
test) shows that the U.S. policy to stifle North Korea has not in 
the least changed,'' said a commentary in a newspaper for the 
ruling Workers' Party. The U.S. Air Force earlier this month 
launched an unarmed missile and destroyed it with an interceptor 
rocket over the Pacific in its first test of a proposed missile 
defense system. North Korea rattled nerves in Asia last year when 
it test-fired a long-range missile over Japan.

<P>
	GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- Chechnya's leader outlined a peace plan  
today to end the fighting in his breakaway republic. Chechen 
President Aslan Maskhadov also promised to crack down on renegade 
warlords if Russia withdraws its troops from Chechen territory. 
Maskhadov called on Russia to immediately end ``all combat 
actions,'' and said the two sides should observe the basic 
principles of a 1997 peace accord that ended the 1994-96 Chechen 
war. Maskhadov's plan appears unlikely to make much headway with 
the Russians.

	Delay Sought for Test Ban Vote  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House dispatched Cabinet members  
today to press the Senate to put off voting on a nuclear test ban 
treaty headed for rejection. One Republican opponent, Sen. Jon Kyl 
of Arizona, predicted certain defeat of the Comprehensive Test Ban 
Treaty if a Tuesday vote goes forward. Three Cabinet members and 
the president's top military officer said rejecting the treaty 
would prevent the United States from taking the lead in halting the 
spread of nuclear weapons.

<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Thousands of people sang hymns and prayed in a  
supermarket parking lot in west London today, remembering 40 people 
killed nearby five days earlier when two passenger trains collided. 
Worshippers at churches across the country said special prayers, 
while forensic experts sifted through the charred remains of one 
carriage of the express train that collided with another train 
about two miles west of London's Paddington Station.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- The drug Zoloft, approved in 1992 to treat  
depression, is expected later this year to become the first 
prescription medication specifically approved by the federal 
government for post-traumatic stress. A Food and Drug 
Administration advisory panel on Friday approved the drug's

breaking a 17-game losing streak against the 49ers and improve to 
4-0. The heroes for the Rams were Kurt Warner, who threw five 
touchdown passes, and Isaac Bruce, who caught four, fitting for a 
team that had been repeatedly beaten by Joe Montana and Steve Young 
throwing to Jerry Rice, a more renowned ``80'' than the oft-injured 
Ram.

Cowboys 13-10 today for their first victory in almost a year. Doug 
Pederson hit Charles Johnson for a 28-yard touchdown as the Eagles 
came back from a 10-point deficit in the fourth quarter. It was 
Philadelphia's first offensive touchdown after 18 quarters without 
one, dating to the first quarter of the season-opening loss against 
Arizona.

<HEADLINE> N.Korea Denounces U.S. Missile Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- North Korea denounced the United  
States on Sunday for testing a defense missile system over the 
Pacific, and vowed to build up its own defense capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
	``This (the test) shows that the U.S. policy to stifle North  
Korea has not in the least changed,'' said a commentary in Rodong 
Sinmun, a newspaper for the ruling Workers' Party. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will build our defense capabilities with high vigilance  
against the perfidious acts of the U.S.,'' it said. The report was 
carried by the North's official foreign news outlet, the Korean 
Central News Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Air Force earlier this month launched an unarmed  
missile and destroyed it with an interceptor rocket over the 
Pacific in its first test of a proposed missile defense system. 
</P>
<P>
	The system is designed to destroy missiles launched by rogue  
states or terrorists. Western countries, including the United 
States, have suspected North Korea, Iran and Syria of developing 
long-range missiles capable of hitting the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	But the North Korean commentary said Pyongyang was only trying  
to defend itself, whereas Washington was ``the aggressive force 
trying to hurt North Korea.'' 
</P>
<P>
	North Korea rattled nerves in Asia last year when it fired a  
long-range missile over Japan. This summer, the United States, 
Japan and South Korea feared that the North would test a new 
missile capable of reaching Alaska or Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States lifted some restrictions last month on trade,  
travel and banking in the reclusive communist country. In response, 
North Korea said it would freeze test-launches while its government 
negotiated with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Late last month, though, North Korea said it would still  
test-launch a missile if necessary.

<HEADLINE> Czech Premier: Breakup a Mistake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) -- Czech Premier Milos Zeman says the  
1993 breakup of Czechoslovakia was an ``irreversible mistake,'' the 
newspaper Lidove Noviny reported in its weekend edition. 
</P>
<P>
	The Czechoslovak federation broke up peacefully on Jan 1, 1993,  
after Slovakia demanded more autonomy from the federal capital in 
Prague. Known as the ``velvet divorce,'' it was the subject of 
bitter debate not only between the two sides but also within the 
Czech and Slovak areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Zeman, who criticized the split at the time, met with Slovak  
Premier Mikolas Dzurinda in Prague on Thursday. He said the 
complicated process of working out a financial settlement should be 
final by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	There is little friction over the issue today, but looking back,  
Zeman called the breakup a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a decision that cannot be taken back and despite that I  
call it a mistake ... a mistake that is irreversible,'' he told the 
paper. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether the Czech Republic and its people would be better  
off in a still-federal Czechoslovakia, Zeman said, ``from a 
geopolitical point of view that is certainly so,'' but added that 
he supported Slovakia's membership in NATO as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
	When the nations were splitting, Zeman had sought a confederal  
arrangement that both the Czech and Slovak governments considered 
unfeasible.

<HEADLINE> First Drug To Treat Stress Disorder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                          *BY PHIL GALEWITZ   	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- After watching one of his firemen die in the  
line of duty, fire Chief John Soave became withdrawn, had trouble 
sleeping and was bothered by flashbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors diagnosed him with post-traumatic stress disorder, a  
psychiatric condition once associated only with combat veterans, 
but now known to affect millions of people who experience car 
accidents, sexual assaults and other horrible incidents. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of his treatment, Soave was prescribed Zoloft, a drug  
first approved in 1992 for depression. 
</P>
<P>
	``It helped calm me down,'' said Soave, of Staughton, Mass.,  
whose been taking Pfizer's once-a-day pill for two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on its early success, Zoloft later this year is expected  
to become the first prescription medication specifically approved 
by the federal government for post-traumatic stress. 
</P>
<P>
	A Food and Drug Administration advisory panel on Friday approved  
the drug's expanded labeling, and the agency usually follows its 
advice. However, despite Soave's success, panelists cautioned the 
drug so far seems to help only women, not men with the anxiety 
disorder. 
</P>
<P>
	Health experts say the approval will be both symbolic-- by  
drawing more attention and perhaps research dollars to the disorder 
-- and it will have the practical effect of leading more doctors to 
prescribe the medication and make patients more accepting of it. 
</P>
<P>
	It is estimated that about 7 percent of Americans will suffer  
from post traumatic stress at some point in their life. 
</P>
<P>
	Psychiatrists, who believe Zoloft makes patients more amenable  
to the counseling necessary to overcome their disorder, say the FDA 
approval would help increase awareness of the disease that often 
goes untreated. That's because drug companies like Pfizer typically 
spend heavily educating consumers and doctors about a condition 
once they win expanded labeling. 
</P>
<P>
	After the FDA approves a drug for one disease, doctors can  
prescribe it for any purpose, though pharmaceutical firms can only 
market it for the specific condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Mental health experts applaud Pfizer's attempt to get the  
additional FDA approval for Zoloft. 
</P>
<P>
	But Pfizer has its own motivations.  
</P>
<P>
	Zoloft is Pfizer's second leading selling drug, behind blood  
pressure pill Norvasc. Zoloft, which is expected to record $2.1 
billion in sales this year, is locked in a battle with several 
other antidepressants including Eli Lilly's top seller Prozac and 
SmithKline Beecham's Paxil, which is a close third. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the three drugs are similar, the companies have tried to  
differentiate them by getting approved for conditions beyond 
depression. SmithKline, for example, this summer won federal 
approval to market Paxil to treat social phobia or extreme shyness. 
Eli Lilly is seeking FDA approval to market Prozac for the most 
severe form of premenstrual syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
	Expanding the uses of an existing drug is one of the most common  
methods pharmaceutical firms use to build profits. It's 
considerably cheaper and less risky than developing a new drug. 
</P>
<P>
	The expanded labeling should give a small boost to Zoloft sales,  
said Alex Zisson, a securities analyst with Hambrecht &AMP; Quist. More 
significantly, he said, it will help Pfizer improve its ties with 
psychiatrists. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good way to keep the thought leaders in the psychiatric  
community happy with the company,'' Zisson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Patients who suffer from post-traumatic stress experience a wide  
variety of symptoms including nightmares, flashbacks and intrusive 
recollections -- patients think about the events that caused the 
trauma even though they don't want to. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts stress Zoloft helps with the symptoms but is not a cure.  
Only counseling helps patients get over the trauma. Women are more 
likely than men to develop the condition, though researchers are 
not sure why. 
</P>
<P>
	``The drug is quite helpful,'' said Dr. Bessl vanderKolk, a  
psychiatrist at Boston University. ``It helps people to be less 
there and more here; it helps people live in the present and be 
less overwhelmed by their past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A study of 187 post traumatic stress patients found that those  
who took Zoloft had significantly fewer symptoms than those taking 
a dummy pill, according to a report presented at the American 
Psychiatric Association meeting earlier this year. Patients had 
fewer feelings of hopelessness and memory impairment. 
</P>
<P>
	The most common side effect shown in the studies was insomnia  
and dry mouth. The study was funded by Pfizer. 
</P>
<P>
	Soave, who resigned as fire chief in January 1998, was not a  
part of the study. He said Zoloft and counseling have helped him 
deal with the emotional toll of the fatal fire that occurred in 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``It never goes away, but the impact is much lower than what it  
was.''

<HEADLINE> Deutsche Telekom in U.S. Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- Deutsche Telekom, seeking a major international  
partner, is in talks with Ameritech Corp. and SBC Communications, 
whose merger has just been cleared by U.S. authorities, a newspaper 
reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Welt am Sonntag gave no details on what linkup might be planned.  
Deutsche Telekom spokesman Ullrich Lissek said: ``Right now, 
everybody is negotiating with everybody. But we don't get involved 
in speculation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The former German state telephone monopoly has struggled to  
branch out into a global player since being partly privatized in 
recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	SBC and Ameritech are set to become the largest U.S. local phone  
company through a merger worth more than $70 billion, one of the 
largest in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a magazine said Deutsche Telekom wants to dump its  
loss-making Global One partnership with France Telecom and U.S. 
long-distance provider Sprint. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprint will have to leave Global One once its planned $115  
billion merger with MCI WorldCom -- the biggest in corporate history 
-- goes ahead, Focus magazine quoted Telekom chairman Ron Sommer as 
saying. 
</P>
<P>
	And ``if the French offer a good price, they can have Global  
One,'' he said, adding that Telekom had the means for a major 
linkup. 
</P>
<P>
	``Theoretically, we could link up with one of the three big  
telephone companies in the United States -- though that doesn't mean 
we're interested,'' Sommer told Focus. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom chief Bernie Ebbers reportedly said he has major  
plans to take on European telecom operators on their own turf. 
</P>
<P>
	By building up its own network, WorldCom would have excellent  
chances of grabbing business from companies such as Deutsche 
Telekom or Spain's Telefonica, Der Spiegel magazine quoted Ebbers 
as saying.

<HEADLINE> White House Hopefuls Lobby for Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *Associated Press Writer-    	
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The urgent calls to United Food and  
Commercial Workers President Doug Dority came back-to-back -- Vice 
President Al Gore on Friday, Bill Bradley on Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The candidates' personal appeals were, other union officials  
said, pretty typical of the last-minute lobbying over the AFL-CIO 
endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
	Dority's reply to each was just as typical of the dynamic at  
work on the eve of the 13-million-member labor federation's 
biennial convention: I will support Al Gore, but ... 
</P>
<P>
	``An endorsement a couple of months from now may be the most  
impactful way to proceed,'' Greg Denier, Dority's senior assistant, 
said late Saturday. ``It's a matter of practical, political 
consideration that there has to be some consensus building and on 
the question of early endorsement, obviously there's not 
consensus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By Sunday afternoon, after AFL-CIO President John Sweeney  
pressed Gore's case in a private meeting, the UFCW board voted 
unanimously to endorse Gore. Dority, whose union represents 1.4 
million workers, immediately hit the phones to lobby fellow union 
presidents. 
</P>
<P>
	Presidents of the AFL-CIO's biggest unions, including the UFCW,  
are expected to vote Wednesday whether to recommend the 
federation's overall endorsement, which in turn will be decided by 
all 68 member unions. 
</P>
<P>
	Denier explained that the news media had driven the stakes so  
high that UFCW didn't want a ``no'' vote to be misinterpreted ``as 
weak support for Gore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sounding satisfied, Sweeney said the votes are moving his way.  
``More and more people are realizing that it's really not early,'' 
he told a reporter. 
</P>
<P>
	How did the stakes mount so high? Interviews with several labor  
operatives suggest that Gore, despite a history of regular 
attention to union meetings and conventions, waited too long to 
place his calls to key labor leaders and seal their support. In the 
meantime, Bradley and his top operatives -- campaign manager Gina 
Glantz and strategist Will Robinson, both with their own long, 
professional ties to organized labor -- aggressively worked the 
phones. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley's message -- ``All I'm asking is that you give me some  
time'' before going with Gore -- began to stick among labor leaders 
not necessarily pro-Bradley but committed to letting the decision 
come from members not yet focused on the 2000 election. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that Bradley is closing in on -- or edging ahead of -- Gore in  
the key states of New Hampshire and New York, Gore allies fear 
another delay in the AFL-CIO endorsement that they have sought 
since February would be too big a blow to his already flagging 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Gore wouldn't get it, I think it would be very, very  
harmful to Gore,'' acknowledged Gerald McEntee, president of the 
American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, and 
Gore's chief backer at the convention. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bill Bradley and his folks have worked very hard. If there is  
an endorsement, Bradley is hurt, but not as much,'' McEntee said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sept. 27, both campaigns made separate presentations to the  
AFL-CIO's executive council, the 15 to 20 presidents of the largest 
affiliated unions, in a suite at the Hay-Adams Hotel across from 
the White House. Both camps showed slides of their polling data, 
fund raising, organizational structure and strategies for winning 
both the Democratic nomination as well as the general election. 
</P>
<P>
	One Gore ally present for both sessions, speaking on condition  
of anonymity, called Bradley's presentation ``surprisingly 
credible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Gore's problem, if you were to ask him and he were to be  
honest with you, is that the campaign underestimated how hard this 
(endorsement) would be and sort of took it for granted,'' Teamsters 
political director Michael Mathis said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the week or so leading up to the convention, not only did  
Gore hit the phones, but campaign chairman Tony Coelho enlisted the 
top Democrat in the House, Richard Gephardt of Missouri -- about as 
pure a labor hero as the Democrats have -- to make some calls, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the huge chore of moving Gore's campaign from Washington  
to Tennessee in the space of one week, Coelho and campaign manager 
Donna Brazile planned to fly to the convention to solidify support. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley aides closely monitored the back-room wrangling from his  
New Jersey headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerry Shea, governmental affairs assistant to Sweeney, said Gore  
has gotten a bum rap and, given how hard he has worked -- in the 
White House and in Congress before then -- to advance labor 
interests, should not have been expected to work so hard for an 
endorsement that many view as inevitable still.

	``The union presidents wanted to be asked, every president  
wanted to be called,'' said Shea. ``People were holding him to a 
higher standard.''

<HEADLINE> Hyundai May Build Plant in N.Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Hyundai group officials will visit  
North Korea this week to discuss a plan to build a large-scale 
industrial park in the reclusive communist country, company 
officials said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 20-member delegation will arrive in the North on Saturday  
for a 10-day visit to conduct field research on several candidate 
towns on North Korea's southwest coast, close to border with South 
Korea, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement was made after Chung Ju-yung, founder and  
honorary chairman of the Hyundai group, received approval for the 
plan from North Korean leader Kim Jong Il during his five-day visit 
to the North earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyundai plans to relocate 800 to 900 garment plants, assembly  
plants for cars, televisions and other electronic products and use 
surplus South Korean electricity for the factories. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan reflects the growing business links between North Korea  
and the largest South Korean conglomerate. Under a $942 million 
deal, Hyundai launched a sightseeing cruise of a scenic North 
Korean mountain in November. 
</P>
<P>
	Relations between the two Koreas remain largely frozen because  
of political and military tensions. They are still technically at 
war, having signed no peace treaty at the end of the 1950-53 Korean 
War.

<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Sir Nigel Broackes, former chairman of engineering  
conglomerate Trafalgar House and the man who began the rejuvenation 
of London's Docklands district, died Sept. 28. He was 65. 
</P>
<P>
	No cause of death was given.  
</P>
<P>
	Using a legacy from his grandfather, Broackes dabbled in  
property development, initially with little success. But he used 
his last asset, a small apartment block, to gain control of a new 
company, Trafalgar House, and built it into a world leader in 
technology-based engineering services and international 
construction. He served first as managing director, then as 
chairman from 1969-92. He was knighted in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Trafalgar House has annual sales of more than $4 billion,  
has 28,000 employees and owns the Cunard cruise line and London's 
Ritz Hotel.

</P>
<P>
	PALM HARBOR, Fla. (AP) -- Manfredo Fest, a jazz pianist and a  
pioneer of the Brazilian bossa nova movement that swept the world 
in the 1960s, died Friday while awaiting a liver transplant. He was 
63. 
</P>
<P>
	Fest, a native of Brazil, had lived in the Tampa Bay area since  
1987. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics credit Fest and other musicians such as Joao Gilberto,  
Antonio Carlos Jobim and Luiz Bonfa with helping revolutionize 
Brazilian and international pop music by refining bossa nova from 
samba in the early 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	He arrived in this country in 1967 and set about developing a  
blend of Brazilian and American jazz. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important to have a trademark,'' Fest said in 1997. ``If  
I came to the United States to play American jazz, I'd be only one 
more in the crowd.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Legally blind since birth, he worked for two years as arranger  
and keyboard player for Sergio Mendes' Brazil 66. He also played 
with Lee Ritenour and Floria Purim.

<P>
	MESA, Ariz. (AP) -- Dwight W. Patterson, a rancher and civil  
leader responsible for bringing the Chicago Cubs spring training 
camp to the Phoenix area, died Friday. He was 87 
</P>
<P>
	Patterson served on the city's junior chamber of commerce and  
became the first ``chief'' of the HoHoKams service organization, 
which guaranteed the Cubs $22,000 if they came to Mesa for spring 
training in 1951, then arranged for the Cubs to play at Rendezvous 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
	With the exception of one spring in California and a handful in  
Scottsdale, the Cubs have trained in Mesa ever since. The team 
attracted 176,000 fans to their camp last spring.

</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Lee Richardson, an American actor in stage, film  
and television work noted for his English accent, died Oct. 2 of 
cardiac arrest after complications from a perforated ulcer. He was 
73. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson was a fixture on the New York stage and in regional  
repertory roles for more than 40 years. He was born in Chicago but 
performed in so many roles with an English accent that he was 
widely assumed to be British. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson read the works of Shakespeare and Noel Coward as a  
soldier in the Army Air Corps during World War II. He moved to the 
Goodman Theater School in Chicago after the war. 
</P>
<P>
	By 1954, he was appearing regularly on the television drama  
anthologies ``Playhouse 90'' and ``Studio One.'' He performed with 
George C. Scott in Central Park in the 1962 production of ``The 
Merchant of Venice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He later became a founding member of the Guthrie Theater in  
Minneapolis, working with Jessica Tandy, Hume Cronyn and Rita Gam, 
among others. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson was nominated for a Tony Award in 1973 for his  
performance in ``Vivat! Vivat Regina!'' and appeared in John 
Huston's ``Prizzi's Honor.''

</P>
<P>
	GLASTONBURY, Conn. (AP) -- Robert Waite, a Williams College  
historian who brought the psychoanalytic approach to books about 
Hitler, died Oct. 4. He was 80. 
</P>
<P>
	Waite was one of the first proponents of analyzing events in  
Hitler's early life in Freudian terms to explain his behavior later 
in life. His most influential book was ``The Psychopathic God: 
Adolf Hitler'' (1977). 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe that the career of Adolf Hitler raises questions  
that can be answered neither by psychology nor by history working 
alone,'' Waite said in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
	Waite collected everything he could about Hitler's psychological  
behavior and pulled it together in a single study, said Robert Jay 
Lifton, a psychiatry professor at the Graduate Center of the City 
University of New York. 
</P>
<P>
	But Waite was criticized for undervaluing external influences  
such as European history, Christian anti-Semitism and ideology in 
explaining Hitler. Some of the evidence presented and analyzed by 
Waite, including claims about Hitler's sexual preferences and an 
autopsy report that Hitler had only one testicle, were suspect, 
critics have said.

<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Morris West, a best-selling Australian  
thriller writer, died Saturday of heart failure while working on 
his latest novel, his son said. He was 83. 
</P>
<P>
	The creator of novels including ``The Devil's Advocate,''  
``Children of the Sun'' and ``Shoes of a Fisherman'' died while 
working ``The Last Confession.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Born in Melbourne, West wrote 27 novels, as well as screenplays,  
radio dramas and plays. His works, which have been translated into 
27 languages, have sold more than 60 million copies worldwide.

	 *Martin Bartner    	
</P>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Martin Bartner, the publisher of The  
Star-Ledger who helped the newspaper expand into the state's 
largest during his 46-year career there, died Sunday at his home in 
Verona. He was 69. 
</P>
<P>
	The paper did not release the cause of death.  
</P>
<P>
	Bartner, who began working at the paper part time as a  
teen-ager, eventually rose to director of advertising, then was 
named associate publisher in 1980 and publisher in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a remarkable man. In rough times, faced with great  
challenges, he exuded optimism, helping us to carry forward,'' said 
Donald E. Newhouse, president of The Star-Ledger. ``In the best of 
times, he was modest and unassuming, giving credit for successes to 
his associates.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Born in Newark on Aug. 11, 1930, Bartner was an only child whose  
parents owned a small, dry goods store. While attending Belleville 
High School, he became The Star-Ledger's student correspondent, 
calling in sports stores for 10 cents per column inch. 
</P>
<P>
	After graduating from New York University, where he majored in  
journalism, Bartner returned to The Ledger to cover sports full 
time. But by 1951, married and planning a family, Bartner switched 
from reporting for what was then regarded as ``a racing and scandal 
sheet'' to advertising -- his true calling. 
</P>
<P>
	Following a two-year stint in the Army, Bartner returned to The  
Star-Ledger in 1955 and was sent to its sister paper, the Jersey 
Journal. After several promotions in the advertising department, he 
went back to The Ledger in 1965 as manager of classified ads. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Willse, who became editor of The Star-Ledger four years ago,  
recalled Bartner as ``the best publisher an editor could ask for, 
and a great friend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include his wife, Audrey; a son, Douglas; a daughter,  
Lisa Coleman; and three grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
	Funeral services will be held Monday at Temple B'nai Jeshurun in  
Short Hills. Interment will follow at the Beth David Memorial Park 
in Kenilworth.

<HEADLINE> Canada, Haiti Qualify for Gold Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Canada and Haiti emerged from the final day  
of a four-team round-robin playoff with berths in the CONCACAF Gold 
Cup soccer tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Carlo Corazzin's two first-half goals gave Canada a 2-1 victory  
over Haiti on Sunday in the first game of the doubleheader and a 
group-high seven points. 
</P>
<P>
	Haiti qualified despite Cuba's 3-1 victory over El Salvador in  
the second game. 
</P>
<P>
	Haiti and Cuba tied for second with four points each, but  
Haiti's 1-0 victory over Cuba on Friday night determined the final 
berth. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gold Cup, the championship for North America, Central  
America and the Caribbean, will take place Feb. 12-27 in Los 
Angeles, Miami and San Diego. A draw will take place Wednesday in 
New York to place the 12 teams in groups. The United States has an 
automatic berth as the host nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Corazzin scored his first goal in the ninth minute when he  
volleyed Marc Bircham's cross off his left foot from 6 yards. In 
the 43rd minute, Corazzin volleyed Jim Brennan's cross with his 
right foot inside the left post. 
</P>
<P>
	Haiti's Johny Descolines broke the shutout when he redirected  
Chrismonor Thelusma's corner kick in the 48th minute. But Haiti had 
to play with 10 men after Thelusma received a red card in the 75th 
minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba's Serguey Prado scored the winning goal in the 75th minute  
when he volleyed Pedro Baez's cross from 10 yards. Teammate Andres 
Roldan added the final goal in second-half injury time. 
</P>
<P>
	Manuel Bobadilla gave Cuba a 1-0 lead in the 44th minute but  
Raul Diaz Arce's penalty kick tied the score three minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
	El Salvador played without midfielder Mauricio Cienfuegos, who  
was suspended for one game after receiving a red card Friday night 
against Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Also suspended were teammate Carlos Castro Borja and head coach  
Mario Perez, who vehemently protested Cienfuegos' ejection at the 
end of the first half Friday night.

<HEADLINE> Study of Three-Strikes Law Vetoed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO (AP) -- Gov. Gray Davis vetoed a bill on Sunday  
ordering a study of the cost and benefits of California's 
six-year-old three-strikes prison sentencing law, which requires 
terms of 25 years to life for a third felony conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	In his written veto message, Davis praised the three-strikes law  
and said the state Department of Justice, the RAND Corporation and 
others have already studied it and the new study was unlikely to 
produce new information. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis said violent crime has dropped 35 percent since enactment  
of the three strikes law.

<HEADLINE> 6 Students Hit by Truck and Killed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLLEGE STATION, Texas (AP) -- Six college students getting out  
of their cars or walking along a highway on their way to a 
fraternity party were killed early Sunday by a pickup truck whose 
driver who had fallen asleep, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident happened just after midnight about two miles west  
of the Texas A&AMP;M University main campus, said police Maj. Mike 
Patterson. 
</P>
<P>
	The victims -- four students from Baylor University, one from  
Texas A&AMP;M and one from Southwest Texas State -- were among a group 
of people who were going to a party at the Tau Kappa Epsilon house 
along a four-lane highway. Some had just parked on the road 
shoulder and the pickup sideswiped two parked cars and struck a 
third. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses said parties at the fraternity often draw large crowds  
of people who must park on the shoulder of the highway, which has a 
65-mph speed limit. 
</P>
<P>
	The man driving the pickup, also a Texas A&AMP;M student, had just  
taken his girlfriend home and was returning to campus when he fell 
asleep and veered off the road, Patterson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We could hear screaming and stuff but at first we didn't have  
any idea he was running over people,'' said Daniel Lara, a 
22-year-old student who lives next door to the fraternity. ``We 
walked out and saw bodies all over the place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Their shoes were in perfect place from where they were  
walking,'' said Arissa Hill, a Blinn College freshman who was going 
to the party. 
</P>
<P>
	The driver, 18-year-old Texas A&AMP;M student Brandon Kallmeyer, was  
not injured and apparently had not been drinking, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Patterson said investigators will present evidence to Brazos  
County prosecutors without recommending charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The victims were identified as Emily Hollister, 18, Tricia Calp,  
18, Dolan Wastel, 22, and Erika Lanham, age unknown, all Baylor 
students; William Flores, 22, of Southwest Texas, and Ted Bruton, 
21, of Texas A&AMP;M. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other people were hospitalized, but their injuries did not  
appear to be life-threatening.

<HEADLINE> Red Sox Peak in Prime Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- No, they didn't change uniforms. And no, that  
wasn't Manny Ramirez driving in all those runs. 
</P>
<P>
	That really was the Red Sox setting postseason records with 23  
runs and 24 hits against baseball's highest-scoring team since 
1950, the Cleveland Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	And the seven RBIs? Boston's John Valentin got those, not  
Ramirez, whose 165 RBIs were the most in the majors since 1938. 
Valentin did it with two homers, a double and a single, all in the 
first four innings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sure, I had a great night. I'm very happy,'' Valentin said,  
``I'll smile a little bit later, but the team goal is to try to 
win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He had plenty of company as Boston pounded five Cleveland  
pitchers in a 23-7 win Sunday: Trot Nixon and Jose Offerman each 
drove in five runs, Jason Varitek went 4-for-5 with three RBIs and 
a postseason record five runs, and Mike Stanley went 5-for-6. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a great day for a lot of players,'' Valentin said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox hope they have enough strength left to swing the  
bats some more in Monday night's decisive fifth game in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	At least they got there -- on a day in which they outscored 19  
NFL teams. 
</P>
<P>
	A day earlier, that seemed about as unlikely as Valentin getting  
a hit. 
</P>
<P>
	They totaled three runs and 11 hits in losing the first two  
games at Cleveland, and he was 0-for-10 going into the bottom of 
the sixth of Game 3 with the score at 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Then everything changed.  
</P>
<P>
	``Val's a gamer,'' center fielder Darren Lewis said. ``He's  
obsessed with the game. He's into every inning, every pitch, every 
at-bat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Valentin's solo homer put the Red Sox ahead in the sixth inning  
Saturday, but the third baseman's second costly throwing error of 
the series allowed Cleveland to tie the game in the seventh 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	No problem.  
</P>
<P>
	Valentin came up again in the bottom of the seventh and broke  
the tie with a two-run double. That started a six-run inning that 
gave the Red Sox a 9-3 win. 
</P>
<P>
	``These last two games are the most exciting games I've seen in  
a long time,'' said Bret Saberhagen, who will pitch Game 5 on three 
days' rest against Charles Nagy. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, Valentin and the Red Sox earned several lines in next  
year's postseason record book. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything we threw up there they hit,'' Cleveland manager  
Mike Hargrove said. ``When it came down, it wasn't where we were 
standing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The previous record for most runs in a postseason game was 18 by  
the New York Yankees in an 18-4 win over the New York Giants in the 
1936 World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	The previous record for most hits in a postseason game was 22 by  
Atlanta against St. Louis in Game 7 of the 1996 NL championship 
series. 
</P>
<P>
	Valentin's seven RBIs tied the division series record held by  
former teammate Mo Vaughn, who did it in last year's opener at 
Cleveland, and Seattle's Edgar Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
	His 11 total bases broke the division series record of 10 shared  
by Vaughn and Eric Karros of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Valentin accomplished something that may be more amazing.  
</P>
<P>
	He came to bat in each of the last three innings Saturday and  
each of the first four Sunday. In those seven straight appearances, 
he homered, doubled, lined out to right, homered again, singled, 
homered yet again and doubled. 
</P>
<P>
	That added up to four runs and 10 RBIs in a span of just seven  
innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Pretty good for a player who hit just .253 with 12 homers and  
wasn't assured of a spot on the postseason roster until he returned 
from the disabled list on Sept. 23. He went on it Aug. 31 with 
tendinitis in his left knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Rookie Wilton Veras played well in his place. But Valentin  
assured his playoff spot by ending the season with a five-game 
hitting streak and staying healthy. 
</P>
<P>
	He finally was stopped Sunday when he struck out -- swinging, of  
course -- against Sean DePaula in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
	Valentin was due up in the seventh, but with the score 21-6,  
manager Jimy Williams sent up Donnie Sadler to pinch hit. 
</P>
<P>
	Naturally, Sadler doubled.  
</P>
<P>
	``Tonight,'' Valentin said, ``was a special night for the Red  
Sox.''

	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Two years ago, cigars were all the rage.  
</P>
<P>
	Buoyed by glossy magazines touting stogies as an accessory of

<P>
	Cigar night at the Mansion Hill Inn, which boasted the longest  
continuously running cigar night in the country, couldn't compete 
with the dozens of restaurants and bars offering their own 
promotions. 
</P>
<P>
	``EVERYBODY was doing a cigar event,'' Steve Stofelano, Jr. said  
of his restaurant's 1996 decision to stop offering theirs. 
</P>
<P>
	But indications now are that the fad is fading out, and fast.  
</P>
<P>
	Across the Hudson River in Troy, J. Cabrella Inc., a  
two-year-old cigar shop, has filed bankruptcy, citing more than 
$71,000 in obligations to creditors. 
</P>
<P>
	Love of the Leaf, a shop five miles north in Loudonville,  
snuffed its operation months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Clearance deals are the norm at cigar shops across the region.  
</P>
<P>
	And in bars and restaurants, cigar nights aren't the draw they  
once were. Stofelano decided to offer one this past Father's Day. 
It was a wonderful night, he said, but he had to struggle to get 30 
guests. And the ones who came were the old regulars, not the young 
and trendy. 
</P>
<P>
	For them, cigars have come and gone. ``Everybody, if you will,  
has been there, done that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the same story 200 miles west in Rochester, where  
restaurateur Ziad Wehbe isn't bothering to replenish cigar stocks 
at Oasis Mediterranean Bistro. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think anyone cares about them any more,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The ``cigar great awakening'' was bound to crash, said Gerald  
Celente of Trends Research Institute in Rhinebeck, N.Y. The boom 
was marketing-driven, rather than consumer-driven, and reality 
couldn't sustain the imagery. Especially among women. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very unfeminine, and they stink,'' he said. ``Despite all  
the hype and the glossy advertising, women were never going to 
become cigar smokers en masse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And cigar smoking has a heavy ``repulse factor,'' that makes  
cigar smokers a nuisance at parties and restaurants, Celente said. 
</P>
<P>
	For 1999, analysts predict a 10 percent fall in sales of premium  
cigars. Three cigar companies -- JR Cigar, Inc.; General Cigar 
Holdings and Dimon, Inc., showed quarterly revenues down 
significantly from the same period in 1998. Holt's, another cigar 
company, saw its stock rating downgraded by Prudential Bache. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact is there's a limited market out there, and its  
saturated,'' Brown Brothers Harriman Analyst Roy Burry said. 
</P>
<P>
	The cigar business crested in 1964, when Americans were smoking  
9 billion yearly. By 1992, government health warnings had caused 
the industry to fall some 77 percent, to 2.1 billion cigars yearly. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, suddenly, things changed. There was a 14.6 percent jump in  
sales in 1994, followed by a 31 percent rise in 1995. In 1996, 
sales of premium, hand-rolled cigars jumped 67 percent. In 1997, 
they leapt another 30 percent. The Cigar Association of America 
didn't compile figures for 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was seen as one of life's affordable little luxuries, like  
fine wines and single malt scotches,'' Sharp said. 
</P>
<P>
	The soaring economy didn't hurt. Imports poured in from some 18  
countries, and new outlets continued to sprout. Prices climbed. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the newest ones were too late, said Lee Zyniecki.  
Zyniecki, who has owned Edleez Tobacco for 19 years, is somewhat of 
an icon among tobacconists locally and nationally. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will never go back to what it was during the bonanza. All  
these people were gung-ho. Now that's come back down,'' she said. 
What's left are the ones who have been smoking cigars all along, 
and these customers tend to be loyal to vendors who know about the 
business and can obtain good cigars when no one else can. 
</P>
<P>
	``The craze is over,'' said Norman Sharp, president of the Cigar  
Association of America.

<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Jason Kreis scored in 82nd minute Sunday  
night to give Dallas a 2-1 victory over the Tampa Bay Mutiny, 
giving the Burn second place in the MLS' Western Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Dante Washington also scored for Dallas (19-13), which will have  
home-field advantage in their upcoming conference semifinal series 
against the Chicago Fire. 
</P>

	Manny Lagos scored for the Mutiny (14-18), who finished third in  
the Eastern Conference. Tampa Bay will face the Columbus Crew in 
the opening playoff round.

<P>
	Kreis, the MLS scoring champion, tied D.C. United's Roy Lassiter  
for the league lead in goals with his 18th from 10 yards out. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington gave the Burn a 1-0 lead from 15 yards in the 16th  
minute. Dallas appeared to get a break on the goal after replays 
showed Washington may have been offside on the play. 
</P>
<P>
	Lagos got the equalizer in the 71st minute, scoring from 10  
yards after pulling off some nifty footwork to get around 
goalkeeper Matt Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	The Burn were without starters Ariel Graziani (Ecuador) and  
Jorge Rodriguez (El Salvador) due to national team commitments. 
Tampa Bay's Raul Diaz Arce, who has 13 goals, also missed the game

<HEADLINE> CAW Votes To Accept Daimler Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Canadian Auto Workers union members voted  
overwhelmingly to accept a three-year contract with DaimlerChrysler 
AG, union officials announced Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract, which calls for a 3 percent wage increase in each  
year of a three-year package, a $1,000 (Canadian) signing bonus, an 
improved retirement package and other benefits, was approved by 94 
percent of the union members who voted, the CAW said in a news 
release. 
</P>
<P>
	The union had threatened to strike over DaimlerChrysler's  
refusal to force a supplier to recognize the union in the 
supplier's plant. A tentative agreement was reached Tuesday night -- 
about two hours before a strike deadline -- even though the CAW did 
not make any progress on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	The CAW is now negotiating with General Motors of Canada Ltd.  
and has set a strike deadline of midnight, Oct. 19. 
</P>
<P>
	In the United States, the United Auto Workers and Ford Motor Co.  
on Saturday announced a tentative agreement on a new four-year 
contract. Workers at General Motors Corp. and Delphi Automotive 
Systems are expected to complete voting on their new contract this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler workers in the U.S. approved their contract last  
month.

<HEADLINE> Arizona QB Returns to Game </HEADLINE>

<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Arizona quarterback Jake Plummer injured his hip  
in the third quarter of Sunday's game against the New York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
	Plummer hurt his left hip when he was tackled on the Cardinals'  
first possession of the third quarter with Arizona leading 14-0. He 
went to the locker room for X-rays, which were negative, and 
returned to the game with 4:05 left and Arizona leading 14-3. 
</P>
<P>
	Plummer, still recovering from a sprained right thumb he injured  
in the preseason, was having his best game of the season before 
suffering the hip pointer. He had completed 13 of 18 passes for 156 
yards and touchdown with no interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	Going into the game, Plummer was the lowest-rated starting  
quarterback in the NFL with two touchdown passes and 13

<HEADLINE> Broncos 16, Raiders 13 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- The Denver Broncos lost another Pro  
Bowler to injury when tight end Shannon Sharpe fractured his 
collarbone, yet somehow managed to finally win a game in the 
post-John Elway era. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Griese, the last-minute replacement for his own  
replacement, did a pretty decent Elway impersonation as the Broncos 
blew a 13-point halftime lead before bouncing back to win 16-13 
over the Oakland Raiders on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Griese, benched earlier in the week but forced back into the  
starting role by Bubby Brister's rib injury, threw for 234 yards 
and led the Broncos (1-4) on an Elway-like drive at the end of the 
first half. 
</P>
<P>
	``We lost Shannon, we didn't have Terrell (Davis), we could have  
had a lot of reasons, all sorts of excuses, to lose,'' Griese said. 
``But I think this team is tired of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Denver held the Raiders (2-3), who entered the weekend with an  
NFL-best 148 yards per game on the ground, to 55 yards rushing. The 
Broncos also had six sacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to put this nightmare behind us,'' offensive guard  
Gennaro DiNapoli said of the Raiders, whose three losses have been 
by a total of eight points. ``We're going to be fighting an uphill 
battle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jason Elam kicked field goals of 48, 47 and 26 yards for the  
Broncos, who also got a 3-yard scoring pass from Griese to Rod 
Smith. Michael Husted kicked field goals of 47 and 19 yards for the 
Raiders, who also scored on a 21-yard pass from Rich Gannon to 
Derrick Walker. 
</P>
<P>
	But the victory came at a huge cost to the Broncos, already  
missing running back Terrell Davis and linebacker John Mobley for 
the season. Sharpe, a seven-time Pro Bowler, was knocked out of the 
game late in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharpe, who was held without a reception in the game, was hit by  
two defenders and then landed hard on the grass. Broncos coach Mike 
Shanahan said he expects Sharpe to be out 7-9 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems like there's still a hex on us,'' Denver defensive  
tackle Trevor Pryce said. ``We lost Shannon. There's something 
going on. But we keep fighting through it. And that's what you've 
got to have, man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Griese, winless as a starter in the first four games of the  
season, got his job back when Brister -- who strained an oblique 
muscle in his left side during a passing drill Friday -- felt pain 
during warmups before Sunday's game. 
</P>
<P>
	Griese went 17-of-29 and drove the Broncos 57 yards in 40  
seconds late in the first half for their only touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was thrust into a tough situation and responded,'' Raiders  
coach Jon Gruden said. ``He played magnificently.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rookie Olandis Gary had 20 carries for 64 yards for Denver. He  
was a late replacement for Derek Loville, who was slated to replace 
Davis but strained his left hamstring during the week. 
</P>
<P>
	Elam gave the Broncos a 3-0 lead with his 48-yarder midway  
through the first quarter. Elam added his 47-yarder late in the 
second period, after the Raiders failed on fourth-and-1 at the 
Denver 14. 
</P>
<P>
	Husted missed a 53-yard field goal with 56 seconds left in the  
half, and Griese was 4-for-4 as he marched the Broncos down the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
	Griese completed a 7-yard pass to Ed McCaffrey, a 33-yarder to  
Smith and a 14-yarder to third-string tight end Byron Chamberlain 
to get the ball to the Oakland 8. Griese ran to the 3, then found 
Smith alone at the back of the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
	Trailing 13-0 at halftime, Oakland left the field to a chorus of  
boos. 
</P>
<P>
	The Raiders broke a 62-minute scoring drought, extending back to  
the third quarter of their loss a week earlier at Seattle, when 
Gannon lofted a scoring pass to Walker with nine minutes left in 
the third period. 
</P>
<P>
	Husted's 47-yard field goal made it 13-10 and a 78-yard punt  
return by former Broncos player Darrien Gordon set up the tying 
field goal, a 19-yarder by Husted on the first play of the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver responded with an 11-play drive, culminating in Elam's  
26-yard field goal. The drive included a 15-yard penalty on Raiders 
linebacker Greg Biekert for a late hit on Griese. 
</P>
<P>
	Oakland's final drive ended when Tory James intercepted a pass  
by Gannon, who went 25-of-36 for 248 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Raiders offensive tackle Mo Collins injured a ligament in  
his right knee in the first quarter and is expected to miss about 
two weeks. ... Denver cornerback Ray Crockett sprained his left 
knee in the third period. The extent of the injury was not known. 
... The Broncos were 2-of-12 on third-down conversions. The Raiders 
were 3-of-13. ... Raiders receiver Tim Brown, who needed 86 yards 
to become the 16th NFL player with 10,000 yards in receptions, 
caught six passes for 51 yards. ... Eleven players caught passes 
for the Raiders, including Gannon -- who caught a deflection of his 
own pass. ... Shanahan, fired by the Raiders in 1989, is 8-1 
against them since taking over at Denver in 1995.

<HEADLINE> GOP Lawmaker Criticizes Bush </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Disturbed by George W. Bush's criticism of the  
Republican-led Congress, a GOP lawmaker is drawing comparisons with 
another Southern governor who ran against Capitol Hill while 
seeking the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Ray LaHood, R-Ill., cited the example of President Carter,  
a former Georgia governor, in urging Bush to stop attacking 
congressional Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope that he doesn't get in a mode of attacking those of us  
in the majority party who are working very hard to do the people's 
business and then expect to come to the Washington as the president 
and work with us,'' LaHood said Sunday on CBS' ``Face the Nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Jimmy Carter tried that when he was elected president, running  
against the Congress, and couldn't get anything done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, the Texas governor and front-runner for the GOP  
presidential nomination, recently criticized the House Republicans' 
plan to alter a tax credit for the working poor in order to help 
balance the budget. ``I don't think they ought to balance their 
budget on the backs of the poor,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	LaHood, who has endorsed Bush and helped raise campaign funds,  
said criticizing GOP lawmakers would not lay the groundwork for 
positive relations between Congress and a Bush White House. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, he wants to win the nomination,'' LaHood said. ``I  
don't fault him for that, but I don't think you do it by knocking 
the majority party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another Republican presidential candidate, Sen. John McCain of  
Arizona, echoed Bush's criticism of the proposal to spread out the 
payment of earned income tax credits to balance the budget. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason the Republicans went after the working poor is they  
wouldn't go after the special interests,'' McCain said on CBS. 
``They won't take them on because of the big money that controls 
the party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said Sunday that the Senate would not go along with such a  
plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Other Republican presidential rivals aimed their fire at Bush.  
</P>
<P>
	``If you've got a front-runner in your party that is using the  
language of American liberalism to critique the Congress, that's 
got to be bad news for the election,'' Gary Bauer told CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	``That phrase, 'Don't balance the budget on the backs of the  
poor.' That is a classic Ted Kennedy, Barney Frank, Democratic 
National Committee line that they've been using for 30 years every 
time Republicans try to bring some fiscal responsibility to 
Washington.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bush campaign did not respond immediately to a request for  
comment.

<HEADLINE> Los Padres Fires Almost Controlled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BIG SUR, Calif. (AP) -- Firefighters were gaining on two  
wildfires in the Los Padres National Forest that were started by a 
lightning storm a month ago along the central California coast. 
</P>
<P>
	One fire had burned nearly 34,850 acres and was 75 percent  
contained Sunday. The other had burned about 48,815 acres, and 
firefighters expected to have it contained by Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The fires have forced the evacuations of dozens of people,  
including the monks of the New Camaldoli Hermitage monastery, and 
cost an estimated $56 million to fight. Two thousand firefighters 
have been battling the blazes, which started Sept. 8. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Trinity Alps Wilderness in Northern California,  
lightning-sparked fires had consumed 108,363 acres by Sunday, and 
officials said firefighters there continued to make progress toward 
containing them.

<HEADLINE> Delay of Test Ban Treaty Vote Sought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House dispatched Cabinet members  
Sunday to press the Senate to put off voting on a nuclear test ban 
treaty headed for rejection, saying a defeat would endanger 
nonproliferation efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	One Republican opponent, Sen. Jon Kyl of Arizona, voicing  
widespread GOP concerns about verification, said he welcomed a 
chance ``to go back to the drawing board.'' He predicted certain 
defeat of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty if the expected vote 
Tuesday goes forward. 
</P>
<P>
	Three Cabinet members and the president's top military officer,  
pleading the administration's case on the Sunday talk shows, said 
rejecting the treaty would prevent the United States from taking 
the lead in halting the global spread of nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are in a situation right now where we're about to send a  
signal to the rest of the world that we are not as serious about 
controlling the spread of nuclear weapons as we should be,'' 
Defense Secretary William Cohen said on NBC's ``Meet the Press.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said on ABC's ``This  
Week'' that the United States needs ``a tool that will prevent the 
other countries from testing. We believe that we have a reliable 
stockpile (of nuclear weapons). We don't need to test more and we 
want others not to test.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Cohen's side was Gen. Henry H. Shelton, chairman of the Joint  
Chiefs of Staff, who sought to assure the public that the treaty 
would not handicap the United States militarily. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the national security were in any way going to be damaged,  
the joint chiefs would never recommend that we ratify this 
treaty,'' Shelton said. 
</P>
<P>
	And Energy Secretary Bill Richardson joined Cohen and Albright  
in saying the Senate should not act on the treaty without benefit 
of full hearings. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we have now is the need to explain it to the Senate, to  
the Congress,'' he said on Fox. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate opponents led by Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.,  
have said the vote will proceed unless President Clinton withdraws 
the treaty and promises not to resubmit it. 
</P>
<P>
	Kyl contended a defeat would strengthen the United States' hand  
in negotiations with other countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the Senate must vote on this treaty and defeat it,''  
he said on ``Fox News Sunday.'' ``This treaty is not of the same 
caliber as previous arms control treaties.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The treaty would impose a blanket international ban on all  
nuclear test explosions. Supporters estimate they are 15 to 20 
votes short of the two-thirds majority needed for ratification. 
</P>
<P>
	The treaty has been signed by 154 nations, including the United  
States, but ratified by only 48. It will not go into effect if the 
United States does not ratify it. 
</P>
<P>
	Some congressional conservatives argue the United States should  
not give up its right to conduct nuclear tests. But Clinton and 
Democratic leaders say that substantive issue has gotten lost in 
partisan politics. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton sent the signed treaty to the Republican-led Senate two  
years ago. Leaders had refused to hold debate on it before now. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think for the Senate to take it up and just have a couple of  
days of hearing and vote is not a responsible course of action,'' 
Cohen said. ``My own judgment is that we will be seen as being 
frivolous and cavalier by many other nations around the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kyl said senators have had more than enough time to study the  
issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``The treaty is not verifiable,'' he said. ``It has no  
enforcement mechanism whatsoever. ... No president has ever asked 
the United States to submit itself to a treaty in perpetuity that 
would prevent us from testing our nuclear weapons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen and Albright also said it is true that the United States  
cannot detect all nuclear tests conducted by other countries. But 
it can detect test blasts above a certain level, and experts 
believe those below that would not pose a danger to the United 
States.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Eyes Rebound With Films </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Actress Carol Cheng's nickname was ``Cheng:  
Nine Projects.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She didn't do nine movies a year. That was the average number of  
films she was involved in on any given day at the height of her 
career -- and that of Hong Kong's film industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``There used to be checks waiting for me at production  
companies. They were mine if I wanted to sign,'' she says. 
</P>
<P>
	Those checks stopped flowing when the Asian economic crisis  
struck and the Hong Kong film industry found itself overburdened 
with debt piled up in producing too many mediocre movies for the 
market to bear. 
</P>
<P>
	Film production dried up. Hong Kong made just 92 films last  
year, compared with 200 at its peak in 1993. The industry now 
supports just 1,000 people, instead of 8,000 before the financial 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	But the city's film industry -- where Hollywood actors Jackie  
Chan, Sammo Hung, Michelle Yeoh, Chow Yun-fat and Jet Li and 
director John Woo got their starts -- is showing a few signs of 
life. 
</P>
<P>
	Several local blockbusters, such as ``A Man Called Hero'' and  
``Gen X Cops,'' packed people into theaters over the summer, and 
U.S. film companies have bought North American distribution rights 
for both. 
</P>
<P>
	With the region's financial crisis abating, many are asking if  
Hong Kong movies are ready for a revival. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's awakening, but there's still a long way to go,'' says  
Raymond Wong, a veteran actor, director and producer. ``The 
problems didn't appear suddenly one day, so they're not going away 
in one day either.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong films flourished in the late 1980s, when the uncertain  
political climate in the territory gave filmmakers much creative 
fodder. 
</P>
<P>
	Cheng made it big with a series of comedies, portraying a  
strung-out former communist soldier who emigrated from mainland 
China to sophisticated Hong Kong. They were full of cliches and 
slapstick humor, but metaphors of the mainland's impending takeover 
of the then British colony loomed large. 
</P>
<P>
	By the early 1990s, money was flooding in from overseas  
investors, all wanting a slice of the lucrative market. The 
conventional wisdom was that if a movie was from Hong Kong and 
featured an A-list star like Cheng, it was sure to make money. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hong Kong movies were so popular investors needed to buy film  
'futures,''' says Manfred Wong, producer of ``A Man Called Hero.'' 
``They were so eager they paid you cash before you even had an idea 
to sell to them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That propelled the movie industry in a city with a population of  
just under 7 million into the world's No. 3 filmmaking spot, after 
India and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Hong Kong actors and directors perfected their skills  
during the boom before leaving for better money and bigger projects 
in Hollywood in recent years. Filmmakers also created a genre of 
adrenaline-pumping action, with movies like Chow's ``A Better 
Tomorrow'' and Chan's ``The Police Story'' becoming Western cult 
hits. 
</P>
<P>
	But success dragged down quality. Poor scripts and sloppy  
production became the norm in the rush to get movies into theaters. 
Blockbusters were the worst, with the demand of investors for 
expensive big stars leaving directors with little money for scripts 
and production work. 
</P>
<P>
	Cheng says many actors realized there were putting out poor  
films, but ``everyone was trying to make as much as they could 
while they were still hot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``In a way we are responsible (for the slump) because we've  
given the audience so much bad stuff. Obviously they're not going 
to come back,'' she says. 
</P>
<P>
	And they haven't.  
</P>
<P>
	``I always want to support local films, but there just really  
isn't much worth seeing,'' says Tammy Cheung, an independent 
filmmaker who teaches film studies at the Hong Kong Arts Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Poor quality aside, the film industry also has been hurt by  
worsening copyright piracy in Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	Pirated video CDs are available for as little as 64 cents -- with  
audience noise from theater in the background -- almost from the 
moment a movie is released on the big screen. 
</P>
<P>
	That seriously cuts receipts from selling video and TV rights,  
which normally contribute two-thirds of a movie's revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	Some critics say the Asian financial crisis has been good for  
the business. With investment money hard to come by, movie people 
are putting their best into projects that do get financed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Only the fittest survived,'' says Lau Wai-keung, who directed  
``A Man Called Hero,'' a high-tech extravaganza adopted from a 
popular comic. 
</P>
<P>
	Benny Chan, who directed Jackie Chan's ``Who Am I?,'' rounded up  
$25 million to make ``Gen-X Cops.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To keep within the budget, Chan hired three rookie actors to  
play the trio of police school dropouts chasing down international 
terrorists, but invested heavily on computer-generated effects. The 
film won critical acclaim and was one of the summer's biggest 
box-office hits. 
</P>
<P>
	``You want to give them a reason to go to your film instead of  
some standard Hollywood movie,'' Chan says. ``People don't just go 
see a film just because so-and-so is in it.''

<HEADLINE> Bryant Gumbel To Co-Host CBS Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- NBC ``Today'' host Matt Lauer is wishing the  
best for his morning show predecessor-turned-rival Bryant Gumbel. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant will be co-hosting CBS's new ``Early Show,'' set to debut  
at 7 a.m. on Nov. 1 from a new storefront studio in the General 
Motors building across from Central Park. Jane Clayson will be 
Gumbel's co-host. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love the guy,'' Lauer said in the Oct. 16 issue of TV Guide.  
``I want nothing but the best for him. I know he feels the same for 
me. I know he's going to put on a quality show. Other than that, 
what can I say except we both have a job to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not everyone is feeling neighborly toward Gumbel and his new  
show. In September, a posh Fifth Avenue hotel went to court in a 
bid to stop CBS from using the plaza in front of the General Motors 
Building for the ``Early Show,'' citing potential annoyances.

<HEADLINE> 'Double Jeopardy' Tops Box Office / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ``Double Jeopardy'' won the box office battle  
of marital betrayal films. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ashley Judd-Tommy Lee Jones movie about a vengeful woman  
striking back at her double-crossing husband was the No. 1 film for 
the third straight weekend, taking in $13.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Double Jeopardy'' edged ``Random Hearts,'' which debuted in  
second place with $13.1 million. ``Random Hearts'' stars Harrison 
Ford and Kristin Scott Thomas as unlikely lovers thrown together 
after their cheating spouses are killed in a plane crash. 
</P>
<P>
	``Superstar,'' with Molly Shannon in a big-screen story about  
her ``Saturday Night Live'' character Mary Katherine Gallagher, 
opened in fifth place with $9 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Three Kings,'' the tale of American soldiers on a treasure  
hunt at the end of the Gulf War, dropped one spot to third place 
with $11.7 million in its second weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Another take on infidelity, the dark family satire ``American  
Beauty,'' remained strong with $9.2 million for fourth place. The 
film went into wider distribution at 1,226 theaters, up about 500, 
and averaged $7,504 a screen, compared with $4,652 in 2,913 
theaters for ``Double Jeopardy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Double Jeopardy,'' which has grossed $65.8 million in 17 days,  
and ``Random Hearts'' competed for the adult date crowd. Both 
movies drew well with men and women and played strongly to 
movie-goers 25 and older. 
</P>
<P>
	With more of an action edge, ``Double Jeopardy'' had the  
advantage over ``Random Hearts,'' a slow-paced melodrama. 
</P>
<P>
	``That thriller aspect is what is bringing people into the  
theaters,'' said Paul Dergarabedian, president of Exhibitor 
Relations Co. Inc., which tracks movie-ticket sales. ``Whereas 
'Random Hearts' had more of a romance angle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A two-hour, 11-minute character study, ``Random Hearts''  
received generally poor reviews describing it as dull. 
</P>
<P>
	Unusual for Ford, who's known for action-adventure films that  
appeal mainly to men, the movie drew a bigger female audience, said 
Ed Russell, executive vice president for publicity at Sony 
Pictures, which distributed ``Random Hearts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Harrison Ford has so much appeal with every audience,'' said  
Robert Bucksbaum, a box-office analyst with Reel Source Inc. ``It's 
incredible that he can do so well with romance when his main forte 
is action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bruce Willis ghost story ``The Sixth Sense'' remained in the  
top 10 for the 10th straight weekend. The film was No. 6 with $6.1 
million and has grossed $242.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at North  
American theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. Final 
figures to be released today. 
</P>
<P>
	1. ``Double Jeopardy,'' $13.6 million.  
</P>
<P>
	2. ``Random Hearts,'' $13.1 million.  
</P>
<P>
	3. ``Three Kings,'' $11.7 million.  
</P>
<P>
	4. ``American Beauty,'' $9.2 million.  
</P>
<P>
	5. ``Superstar,'' $9 million.  
</P>
<P>
	6. ``The Sixth Sense,'' $6.1 million.  
</P>
<P>
	7. ``Blue Streak, $5.5 million.  
</P>
<P>
	8. ``Drive Me Crazy,'' $3.7 million.  
</P>
<P>
	9. (tie) ``Elmo in Grouchland,'' $2.1 million.

<HEADLINE> Jets Brace for Jaguars Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J (AP) -- The Jacksonville Jaguars aren't  
looking at the New York Jets as just another opponent. They're 
approaching Monday night's game as an opportunity to slap down a 
championship contender. 
</P>
<P>
	Sure, the Jets are 1-3 and racked with injuries. Never mind,  
according to the Jaguars (3-1), who still believe the road to their 
first Super Bowl could go through the Meadowlands. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you win, it puts those guys farther from making the  
playoffs,'' Jacksonville receiver Keenan McCardell said. ``That's a 
team capable of getting on a run. Knock them out early and you 
won't have to deal with them later.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Jets were reeling, ready for a knockout, before winning  
their first game last weekend at Denver. Coincidentally, it was the 
Broncos who knocked them out of the playoffs in last season's AFC 
title game, and it was the Jets who knocked the Jags out of the 
playoffs the previous week. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, New York believes it has some life. Beating Jacksonville  
would reinforce those feelings and keep the Jets looking up and 
feeling up. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just like a loss causes you to second-guess,'' linebacker  
Bryan Cox said, ``a win causes you to exude confidence. You can put 
yourself on a roll, that's what winning does, it adds a certain 
amount of confidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both teams' confidence should come from the performances of  
their defenses. Although their offenses were touted coming into the 
season, New York's has sputtered greatly due to injuries, while 
Jacksonville's has been inconsistent since an opening rout of San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	The defenses have turned around some games, most notably last  
week in the Jets' victory at Denver, when they forced six 
turnovers, and in the Jaguars' win at Pittsburgh, when they held 
the Steelers to 216 yards of offense. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacksonville is far more aggressive on defense under new  
coordinator Dom Capers, the former Carolina head coach who came to 
prominence while overseeing Pittsburgh's superb defenses earlier in 
the decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not totally different, but we do have different people  
who are performing and performing well,'' coach Tom Coughlin said. 
``We don't have as many health issues. Guys are on the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got guys like Carnell Lake, Gary Walker, Fernando  
Bryant, Tony Brackens being able to stay healthy. Lonnie Marts is 
making his contribution. It's a matter of different people, playing 
with confidence, and guys who are meeting the physical challenge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It will present a strong challenge to the Jets, who might have  
star receiver Wayne Chrebet back from a broken foot. That would 
make quarterback Rick Mirer's job a lot easier. 
</P>
<P>
	Mirer hasn't hurt the Jets the last two weeks, but he hasn't  
been sensational, either. New York will settle for solid from the 
man who has replaced Vinny Testaverde (torn Achilles' tendon). 
</P>
<P>
	And Jacksonville would settle for the same from its struggling  
attack, from quarterback Mark Brunell to the running backs, 
receivers and line. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason we've struggled is the little things,'' Brunell  
said. ``I don't know if it's pressing too much or not enough. We've 
got to get it going. Everyone realizes that. No one is more 
disappointed in it than we are as players, because we think we've 
got a pretty good offense. We'll get it going. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of times in my career, we've been in a slump.  
Fortunately, all those times, we've come out of it. We've grown and 
we've learned. This is no different. We've got some improving to do 
and we'll do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If they do it Monday night, one potential playoff thorn might be  
as good as removed.

<HEADLINE> AFL-CIO To Offer Members Web Access </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Card-carrying union members soon will have  
access to a special Internet gateway designed to connect workers 
with one another, address labor-related issues and serve as a 
high-tech organizing tool, the AFL-CIO said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will be a revolutionary tool for communications,'' said  
Morton Bahr, president of the Communications Workers of America. 
``Can you imagine being able to ask million of Internet users to 
boycott a product or bombard an elected official with protests?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Web site, which is scheduled to be up and running by Dec. 1,  
is an attempt to create an electronic community for the AFL-CIO's 
68 affiliated unions. The AFL-CIO also was to announce Monday a 
program that will offer affordable computers and Internet access to 
union members. 
</P>
<P>
	The union plans to make Internet access available to union  
members for no more than $14.95 a month, said Ray Abernathy, an 
AFL-CIO spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Union members will be able to finance the purchase of a computer  
for as low as $600, union officials said. The goal is to bring 
families online for less than $30 a month, Abernathy said. 
</P>
<P>
	``With workingfamilies.com, we're helping bridge the growing gap  
between the technological 'haves' and 'have-nots,' and we're also 
giving working families new ways to connect with one another and to 
make their voices heard,'' said John Sweeney, AFL-CIO president. 
</P>
<P>
	Labor officials hope the portal site will become an electronic  
meeting place for the AFL-CIO's 13 million union members and a 
high-tech organizing tool.

<HEADLINE> GOP Group Can't Agree on Endorsement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- A grass-roots conservative Republican  
organization on Sunday failed to agree on which GOP presidential 
candidate it would endorse. 
</P>
<P>
	The first National Federation of Republican Assemblies  
convention ended with a vote in which publisher Steve Forbes got 
164 votes, or 62.4 percent, with Pat Buchanan getting 99 votes, or 
37.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	But Forbes fell short of the group's by-law requiring a  
two-thirds majority for NFRA endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-day NFRA convention in Kansas City drew 274 delegates  
from 33 states. On Saturday they held a rally and straw poll that 
featured speeches by GOP hopefuls Forbes, Buchanan, Gary Bauer and 
Alan Keyes. None of the candidates stuck around for Sunday's 
voting. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFRA, started in 1996, is a grassroots organization devoted  
to advancing conservative issues such as school prayer, an end to 
legalized abortion and tax reform. 
</P>
<P>
	Though all GOP candidates were invited, front-runner George W.  
Bush, Elizabeth Dole, John McCain and Orrin Hatch skipped the 
event. 
</P>
<P>
	All eight candidates were on Sunday's first ballot, but a series  
of votes narrowed the field to the two finalists, Forbes and 
Buchanan.

<HEADLINE> Mich. St. Gets Big Boost From Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	How big was Michigan State's win over Michigan?  
</P>
<P>
	Big enough for the Spartans to leap into the top five of The  
Associated Press' Top 25 college football poll for the first time 
in 32 years. 
</P>
<P>
	With its 34-31 win over the Wolverines on Saturday, Michigan  
State (6-0) jumped six places to No. 5 in this week's AP poll. 
Michigan (5-1), meanwhile, fell seven spots to No. 10. 
</P>
<P>
	It also marks the first time the Spartans have been ranked in  
the top 10 since finishing the 1987 season at No. 8. The last time 
Michigan State cracked the top 5 was a No. 3 ranking on Sept. 18, 
1967. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State (6-0) and Penn State (6-0) remained 1-2 for the  
fourth straight week following balloting Sunday by the 70 sports 
writers and broadcasters on the AP panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Nebraska (6-0), a 49-14 winner over Iowa State, moved up one  
spot to No. 3, followed by No. 4 Virginia Tech and Michigan State. 
Mo. 6 Tennessee, No. 7 Florida, No. 8 Georgia Tech, No. 9 Kansas 
State and Michigan rounded out the top 10. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seminoles, who beat Miami 31-21 on Saturday, had 63  
first-place votes and 1,743 points, while the Nittany Lions, 31-7 
winners over Iowa, had six first-place votes and 1,678 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Virginia Tech (5-0), which routed Rutgers 58-20, had the other  
first-place vote. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> D'Backs' Season Falls Flat at Finish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- One-hundred victories. The first team to make the  
playoffs in just its second season. The biggest one-year turnaround 
in baseball history. NL West champions. 
</P>
<P>
	All of those accomplishments were little consolation to an  
Arizona Diamondbacks team that felt it was destined for more, a 
team that played some of its worst baseball of the season in its 
first-round loss to the New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this team was as good as the San Diego team I played  
on that went to the World Series,'' Steve Finley said. ``We had a 
team that could have won the World Series, but we didn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So much went wrong at the end. Randy Johnson couldn't win a  
playoff game, again. Omar Daal's longest season ever showed in a 
tired arm. The bullpen failed. Tony Womack dropped a fly ball that 
could forever haunt him. Finley almost robbed Todd Pratt of what 
proved to be the deciding home run, yet came up empty-handed. 
</P>
<P>
	In the painful aftermath of Saturday's 4-3, 10-inning loss,  
Johnson reminded everyone of what the team had accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a great regular season. We won 100 games,'' he said.  
``We don't need a complete turnaround. We showed the people of 
Arizona what good major league baseball is all about. We have 
nothing to be ashamed of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson spoke confidently of what lies ahead.  
</P>
<P>
	``With the talent we have on this team, no question we will be  
back,'' he said. ``It's not going out on a limb with the players, 
the leadership, the coaches and the ownership we have, that we will 
be back in the playoffs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet there are many things that must fall neatly into place for  
Arizona to make a return trip to the postseason. Matt Williams, Jay 
Bell, Luis Gonzalez and Finley had among their best, if not the 
best, seasons of their career. A repeat performance from all might 
be too much to ask. 
</P>
<P>
	For the most part, Arizona avoided serious injuries.  
</P>
<P>
	Johnson turned 36 on Sept. 10. He had a marvelous season -- 364  
strikeouts and a 2.48 ERA -- but he threw a career-high 271 2-3 
innings. Maybe that had something to do with his shaky performance 
in Game 1 of the playoffs, when he lost his sixth straight 
postseason decision, a major-league record. 
</P>
<P>
	How many more years will he be able to perform at such a high  
level? 
</P>
<P>
	Then there's Todd Stottlemyre, whose strong performance in Game  
2 was one of Arizona's few postseason bright spots. He will be 35 
next May. The final results of his risky experiment of coming back 
without surgery from a 70 percent tear in his rotator cuff are not 
in. He knows the arm could go at any time. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams turns 34 next month. Bell will be 34 in December. The  
window of opportunity for them won't be open for too many more 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	There is the question of Womack's psyche after his Bill  
Buckner-like blunder Saturday that allowed New York to tie the game 
3-3 in the eighth inning. He was not thrilled with being moved from 
second base to right field to begin with, and he had a miserable 
series at the plate (2-for-18). 
</P>
<P>
	Having traded Tony Batista for Dan Plesac, the Diamondbacks  
could use some stability at shortstop. The bullpen is not blessed 
with depth. 
</P>
<P>
	Andy Benes, who lost his spot in the rotation in the postseason  
and didn't throw a pitch against the Mets, has a clause in his 
contract that allows him to become a free agent at the end of this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	At first base, the Diamondbacks must decide whether to stick  
with strong-hitting rookie Erubiel Durazo or give the job back to 
Travis Lee. Lee, who struggled through a bad year at the plate, 
then sprained his ankle, wasn't even with the team in the playoffs. 
He was left off the 25-man roster and went home to Washington 
state. 
</P>
<P>
	Diamondbacks manager Buck Showalter could move Lee to the  
outfield, or the Diamondbacks could trade him, a tough decision for 
a franchise that gave the young player a $10 million signing bonus 
and expected him to be a cornerstone for years to come. 
</P>
<P>
	There seems little question Arizona will be active in the  
offseason. That is the method of operation of owner Jerry 
Colangelo, who spent $118.9 million on free agents and pulled the 
trigger on the trades that brought Womack, Gonzalez and closer Matt 
Mantei to Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	The Diamondbacks aren't cash-rich. Colangelo had to go back to  
the team's investors for $24 million to meet short-term cash-flow 
needs. But if there is a way, he will try to pull off the deals and 
signings he and those who work for him think the team needs to 
improve. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we weren't disappointed, that would be a problem,''  
Colangelo said. ``As an organization, we have to do the things we 
need to do so we can advance further. We have to grieve a little 
bit, too. We need to get this loss off our chest, roll up our 
sleeves and get ready for spring training.''

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Guerrillas Attack Militia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- Lebanese guerrillas launched a series of  
attacks on Israeli and allied militia outposts Sunday in southern 
Lebanon, but no casualties were reported, Lebanese security 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The attacks were claimed by the Iranian-backed Hezbollah group,  
the pro-Syrian Shiite Muslim Amal movement and the Lebanese 
Resistance Brigades, a guerrilla faction supported by Hezbollah. 
</P>
<P>
	In separate statements issued in Beirut, the three groups said  
the guerrillas fired rockets and mortar shells at posts manned by 
Israeli forces and militiamen of the Israeli-backed South Lebanon 
Army in an Israeli-occupied border zone in south Lebanon. They 
claimed ``direct'' and ``confirmed hits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lebanese officials in towns near the attacks confirmed them, but  
said there were no casualties. 
</P>
<P>
	The officials, speaking on customary condition of anonymity,  
said Israeli troops and SLA militiamen retaliated by shelling 
suspected guerrilla hideouts near villages facing the occupied 
zone. No casualties were reported from the retaliatory shelling. 
</P>
<P>
	Israeli officials did not immediately give a reaction.  
</P>
<P>
	Hezbollah, or the Party of God, is the most active guerrilla  
group fighting to oust 1,500 Israeli soldiers and the 2,500 SLA 
militiamen from the occupied zone. Israel contends that the zone, 
set up in 1985, is necessary to protect its northern towns from 
cross-border guerrilla attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has pledged to withdraw  
Israeli troops from south Lebanon by next July.

	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Chicago Bears quarterback Shane Matthews  
pulled his right hamstring in the fourth quarter against the 
Minnespota Vikings Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Matthews pulled up on a scramble, grabbed his right leg and  
limped out of bounds. He was replaced by rookie Cade McNown. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Unabomber Tells Magazine He is Sane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Unabomber Ted Kaczynski insists in an interview  
that he is not crazy, and says he would have preferred the death 
penalty to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm confident that I'm sane,'' he tells Time magazine in its  
Oct. 18 issue, on newsstands Monday. ``I don't get delusions and so 
forth. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had very serious problems with social adjustment in  
adolescence.... But it would have to be distinguished between an 
organic illness, like schizophrenia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The interview coincides with the imminent release of Kaczynski's  
book-- ``Truth Versus Lies,'' published by Context Books. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaczynski was sentenced in 1998 to life without parole for  
conducting an anti-technology bombing campaign that killed three 
people and injured 22. He pleaded guilty to avoid a trial at which 
his lawyer had planned to offer an insanity defense. But the guilty 
plea also saved him from being sentenced to the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about the prospect of spending life in prison, the former  
Montana forest recluse says he is not optimistic about life in 
general. ``I do not want to live long. I would rather get the death 
penalty than spend the rest of my life in prison,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaczyinski also spoke about his brother, who turned him into  
authorities. When asked what he would say to his brother, David, 
Kaczynski replies: ``I would just turn my back and wouldn't talk to 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He says if their roles had been reversed, and he had suspected  
David of being the Unabomber, ``I would have kept it to myself.''

<HEADLINE> Lynch Goes for More Tender Approach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- What could the director of such dark and moody  
films as ``Eraserhead'' and ``The Elephant Man'' possibly see in 
the tale of an old man who rides his lawn mower across Iowa? 
</P>
<P>
	Tenderness, says David Lynch, the director of the new Disney  
film ``The Straight Story,'' due out Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I responded to the emotion in it,'' Lynch says in The New York  
Times' Sunday editions. ``Then I felt it would be the correct thing 
to do. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt its yearning for pure, intense feeling represented  
something that was in the air. I don't know what's in the air is 
also a desire to have a break from sex and violence or, rather, a 
yearning for more tender, more direct storytelling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lynch isn't the only filmmaker to break from dark plot twists  
recently to spin one to a family audience: David Mamet's ``The 
Winslow Boy'' is a British period piece about a penny crime and the 
legal chaos that follows, and Wim Wenders' ``Buena Vista Social 
Club'' is an uplifting concert movie.

<HEADLINE> Stars 3, Sharks 2 / Hockey Game Story  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Pavel Patera and Jere Lehtinen each  
scored goals in the final 5:40 as the Dallas Stars beat San Jose 
3-2 Saturday night, snapping the Sharks' season-opening three-game 
winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
	Rebounding from a 3-0 loss at Anaheim Friday night, the Stars  
finished up their road trip with their fourth win in five games 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
	With 5:40 remaining, Patera converted Dallas' go-ahead score,  
streaking into the slot to knock in a rebound from a shot by Mike 
Keane. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than 1 1/2 minutes later, the Stars went up 3-1 when Lehtinen  
picked up a loose puck and skated in to beat goaltender Steve 
Shields from up close. 
</P>
<P>
	San Jose pulled back to within one when Owen Nolan scored his  
sixth goal of the season. Nolan, who has at least one goal in his 
first four games, wristed a shot past goaltender Manny Fernandez 
with 2:49 left. The Sharks pulled Shields and added an extra 
attacker with 52 seconds but Fernandez fended off San Jose's late 
flurry. 
</P>
<P>
	Trailing 1-0, San Jose evened the score with 4:30 remaining in  
the second when Stephane Matteau ended a scramble in front of the 
net with his second goal of the season, sending the puck through 
goaltender Fernandez's legs. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas came out strong, outshooting San Jose 16-6 in the first  
period and scoring on a power-play goal by Jamie Langenbrunner. He 
was positioned by the left post and redirected a shot from Derek 
Plante into the net past Shields. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars had a go-ahead goal disallowed with 11:34 left in the  
second. Shields fell into the net after blocking a second straight 
shot, loosening it from its moorings an instant before Brad 
Lukowich chased the rebound down and sent it back toward the net.

<HEADLINE> US Gymnasts Barely Make Medal Round </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TIANJIN, China (AP) -- A recurring bar problem nearly cost  
America's women gymnasts a chance at a World Championships medal. 
</P>
<P>
	Not even aware of their perilous position, Vanessa Atler, the  
last American to compete, clinched a place for the United States in 
the six-team medal round with a 9.762 Sunday in the floor 
exercises. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the fifth best score of the qualifying round in that  
event, and was enough to lift the Americans into fifth place, 
behind defending champion Romania, Russia, Ukraine and China. They 
also were safely into the top 12 that qualify for next year's 
Olympics in Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, it was the 17-year-old Atler who had problems on the  
uneven bars. Falls in that event cost her the national championship 
this year and last. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, she made no mistake, scoring 9.475, while U.S.  
champion Kristen Maloney faltered, falling the wrong way out of a 
handstand. The mistake wasn't apparent to the audience, but she 
scored only 8.975. 
</P>
<P>
	In the same event, Jamie Dantzscher managed only 8.312 as she  
lost her grip on the lower bar at one point. Elise Ray recouped 
vital points with a .600, and later contributed 9.612 in the floor 
exercises. 
</P>
<P>
	Maloney and Atler both scored 9.612 on the balance beam, and  
Maloney had 9.750 on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's competition ``just got all the jitters out,'' said the  
17-year-old Atler, who stood seventh in the individual standings 
with 38.367. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're all really inexperienced, we were all really nervous,''  
Atler said. ``Now that we've got it done, and we know what it's 
like, we can just go out there and have fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Atler said she wasn't aware of the importance of her final floor  
exercise, and Maloney added: ``We didn't really look at the 
scoreboard. We wanted to focus on our routines.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I always get a little nervous, especially being second to the  
last and last on every event. ... But I know I can hit for our 
team,'' Maloney said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the four best scores from five gymnasts in each event  
count toward the total, Atler's 7.762 on the floor made a 
difference of 0.625 to the U.S. score, which was just 0.313 ahead 
of sixth-place Australia and 0.594 better than non-qualifier Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	The medal round comes Tuesday, and coach Kelly Hill said, ``We  
have time now to work out the glitches and we will be fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joining Atler in the 36 who will compete for the individual  
all-around title were Ray, 12th in qualifying with 37.848, and 
Maloney, 16th with 37.768. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. women's team finished sixth in the last World  
Championships in 1997, down sharply from its 1996 Olympic gold 
medal. 
</P>
<P>
	It is competing without Jennie Thompson, third placer in the  
U.S. championships. She reinjured her left ankle in practice here, 
and was replaced by 16-year-old Morgan White. 
</P>
<P>
	In men's qualifying, three-time defending champion China made a  
strong start, leading with 230.546 points to 224.322 for Ukraine, 
224.245 for Germany and 223.733 for Spain after 17 of the 47 teams 
had competed. 
</P>
<P>
	Strong rivals including Russia, Belarus, the United States and  
Japan were not scheduled to compete until Monday.

<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- The music of rhythm and blues pioneer Louis  
Jordan was revived, studied and celebrated over the weekend here. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, scholars and music industry insiders gathered at  
Case Western Reserve University to discuss the life and legacy of 
the singer and sax-playing bandleader. That night, musicians tipped

<HEADLINE> CAW Votes To Accept Daimler Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Canadian Auto Workers union members voted  
overwhelmingly to accept a three-year contract with DaimlerChrysler 
AG, union officials announced Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract, which calls for a 3 percent wage increase in each  
year of a three-year package, a $1,000 (Canadian) signing bonus, an 
improved retirement package and other benefits, was approved by 94 
percent of the union members who voted, the CAW said in a news 
release. 
</P>
<P>
	The union had threatened to strike over DaimlerChrysler's  
refusal to force a supplier to recognize the union in the 
supplier's plant. A tentative agreement was reached Tuesday night -- 
about two hours before a strike deadline -- even though the CAW did 
not make any progress on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	The CAW is now negotiating with General Motors of Canada Ltd.  
and has set a strike deadline of midnight, Oct. 19. 
</P>
<P>
	In the United States, the United Auto Workers and Ford Motor Co.  
on Saturday announced a tentative agreement on a new four-year 
contract. Workers at General Motors Corp. and Delphi Automotive 
Systems are expected to complete voting on their new contract this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler workers in the U.S. approved their contract last  
month.

<HEADLINE> Woman Beats Man in Boxing Match </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Man vs. woman in the ring turned out not to be a  
fair fight, after all. 
</P>
<P>
	Margaret McGregor won every round on every card of her  
four-round, history-making bout Saturday night against Loi Chow, a 
jockey who showed virtually no boxing skills. 
</P>
<P>
	McGregor, a 36-year-old hometown favorite from Bremerton, Wash.,  
towered over Chow and threw combinations that racked up points, 
even if they didn't seem to do any damage. 
</P>
<P>
	All three judges scored the bout 40-36 in McGregor's favor.  
</P>
<P>
	McGregor, in a red sports bra and gold trunks, landed a right to  
the head in the first two-minute round, then a four-punch 
combination. Chow responded by bouncing away. He kept bouncing all 
over the ring, smiling and doing not much else. 
</P>
<P>
	Chow, 0-3, hardly posed a worthy opponent. The 33-year-old from  
Vancouver threw punches awkwardly, covered up most of the fight, 
and landed only a few punches. Listed as 5-foot-2, he seemed a head 
shorter than the 5-4 McGregor. 
</P>
<P>
	McGregor, 4-0, threw punches like a trained fighter, even if she  
never came close to hurting Chow. She was the busier fighter 
throughout the bout, and never looked intimidated by Chow or the 
occasion. As the fourth round came to a close, the crowd chanted, 
``Margaret, Margaret,'' and she responded with a combination to the 
body. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was like my dream was coming true right before my eyes,''  
McGregor said of those chants. ``This is the biggest day of my 
life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd of 2,768 roared with delight at the decision in her  
favor, but booed Chow for his defensive, lackluster effort. 
</P>
<P>
	``I fought my best tonight,'' McGregor said. ``All I want to do  
is keep getting better and better. I don't care who it is, I'll 
fight anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chow's blood pressure was high an hour before the fight card  
started, and the doctor told him to rest a while before taking it 
again to make sure he was OK. Chow passed the test the second time. 
</P>
<P>
	Chow blamed his loss on his high blood pressure, saying that his  
blood pressure actually peaked at 185 over 115 before he took some 
medication to bring it down. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't feel right,'' Chow said. ``I don't think I got  
whipped. I hit her with a couple of good shots.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked what, if anything, the bout proved, Chow responded with a  
smile and a bit of bravado: ``It proves a woman cannot hurt a 
man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked the same question, McGregor said: ``Just that I'm a  
winner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A lot of fans, though, attached more significance to the fight.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's breaking a lot of barriers. I feel like I'm  
taking part in this big event in history,'' said Rosemarie Moore, 
18, Seattle, attending her first fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``Women are saying, `Hey, we're just as good as you.' We've come  
a long way. 
</P>
<P>
	Another fan disagreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a good thing for boxing,'' said Sherman Daniels, 47,  
from Renton, Wash. ``With all the controversy, this might be the 
first and the last time a man and woman fight.''

<HEADLINE> Suspect Charged in Chicago Killings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A man was charged on Sunday with killing three  
women on the city's South Side, the first big break in an 
investigation into a string of serial killings and rapes in several 
poverty-stricken neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
	Ronald Macon has been in jail since August awaiting trial on a  
separate rape charge. Police said DNA evidence linked him to three 
of 13 women slain in the area since 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Cmdr. Frank Trigg said Macon confessed on videotape to  
the killings. 
</P>
<P>
	Police announced during the summer that DNA evidence pointed to  
four separate attackers preying on prostitutes and drug addicts. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is going to continue because the perpetrators are still  
out there, but we're certainly going to pause and acknowledge the 
significance of this,'' Trigg said. 
</P>
<P>
	The three women were killed this year. Angelnetta Peeples, 43,  
was found Feb. 20. She had been strangled and hit in head. Linda 
Soloman, 36, who was found April 14 in a stairwell, also had been 
strangled and hit in the head. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosezina Williams, 50, was found strangled in a dumpster on June  
21. 
</P>
<P>
	Macon was being held on a $1.25 million bond for the previous  
rape charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Charged with three counts of murder, authorities said he could  
face the death penalty if convicted. They said they might also 
charge him with rape. 
</P>
<P>
	Police had been frustrated in finding suspects in the string of  
killings despite the DNA evidence. Few in their neighborhoods knew 
the women or were willing to talk to police. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, authorities thought they had a break when they  
arrested three men and charged them with the March 1998 slaying of 
LaCreesha Avery, 27. 
</P>
<P>
	Avery, who was beaten, raped and strangled, was found wrapped in  
one of the suspects' sheets in the South Side area where the other 
bodies were found, police said. DNA evidence connected her to one 
of the other victims, according to police. 
</P>
<P>
	But authorities later said DNA samples from the three men showed  
no connection to the unsolved killings.

<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Drivers who floor it when the light turns red  
may soon be opening the mail to find themselves caught in the act 
on film. 
</P>
<P>
	About 250 cameras are trained on intersections from Baltimore to  
San Diego and that number is expected to double annually, suppliers 
say. 
</P>
<P>
	Police love the ever-vigilant cameras, which they say reduce  
red-light running and relieve officers from intersection stakeouts. 
Local governments love them because they bring in millions of 
dollars in traffic fines. But privacy advocates worry about the 
introduction of yet another piece of technology to monitor the 
everyday activities of Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	The cameras, long used in Europe and other countries, were slow  
to catch on in the United States. But in the five years since 
cameras went up in New York City, they have spread to nearly 50 
cities and 10 states. They have generated an estimated $90 million 
in gross revenues, according to Lockheed Martin IMS, a major 
supplier. 
</P>
<P>
	Few states have embraced the cameras as enthusiastically as  
Maryland, where experienced drivers know a green light means wait 
for the red-light runners to clear the intersection. 
</P>
<P>
	Baltimore has a dozen cameras and has signed up for 48 more,  
which will make it one of the largest users in the nation. The 
number of red light cameras elsewhere in Maryland is expected to 
grow from 75 to 200 by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
	Traffic safety advocates say it's about time. Each year,  
red-light running accounts for about 260,000 crashes, 121,000 
injuries and more than 800 deaths nationwide, according to the 
Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. Fatal crashes at 
intersections with traffic signals have risen 24 percent, from 
1,888 in 1992 to 2,344 in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``Red-light running is an extension of the kind of aggression  
we're seeing more and more in everyday life,'' said Richard 
Retting, a traffic safety engineer at the Insurance Institute. 
``People in a hurry tend to not to want to stop if they have the 
choice. The tradeoff is somebody saves a few seconds, but 
increasingly puts someone else at risk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An Insurance Institute study found that red-light violations  
dropped 40 percent in Fairfax, Va., and Oxford, Calif., after 
cameras were introduced in 1996 and 1997, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	Police in Howard County, a wealthy suburb of Baltimore and  
Washington, D.C., found the number of red lights run at four 
intersections dropped 57 percent five months after cameras were 
introduced last year. At one intersection, collisions dropped from 
15 in 1997 to eight last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very effective, sustained program for changing driving  
behavior to make roads safer,'' said Lt. Glenn Hansen, who runs the 
county's program. ``It frees up officers to handle other needs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A camera snapped 75-year-old John Lobell's picture as he drove  
to a church meeting in Howard County last year. He thought the 
light was yellow, until he opened the mail two weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no questioning it,'' he said. ``There's nobody to  
argue with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a wake-up call to all of us to slow down and pay  
more attention to traffic,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cities and counties using cameras allow firms, such as  
Electronic Data Systems of Plano, Texas, and Lockheed Martin IMS, a 
subsidiary of the Bethesda-based defense giant, to do a job once 
done exclusively by police. 
</P>
<P>
	When a car speeds through a red light at any of 20 intersections  
in Howard County, a magnetic relay beneath the pavement sends a 
signal and the shutter on a $50,000 German-made camera pops open 
twice. A computer notes the time, date, vehicle speed and amount of 
time the light was red. 
</P>
<P>
	Each day, a company technician retrieves the film, scans the  
negatives into a computer, looks up the license plate number and 
draws up a ticket. The ticket is verified by a civilian police 
employee and sent to the registered car owner. 
</P>
<P>
	What if a lead-footed friend borrows the car and runs a red  
light? In Maryland, as in most states, drivers can go to court and 
testify they weren't behind the wheel. In New York, the registered 
owner is liable. 
</P>
<P>
	At busy intersections, the money can add up.  
</P>
<P>
	Howard County's cameras generated at least $1.37 million between  
February 1998 and May 1999. Baltimore's six red-light cameras have 
issued more than 9,500 tickets -- adding up to $700,000 in fines -- 
in less than six months. 
</P>
<P>
	The 30 cameras on the clogged streets of New York generate about  
$8 million in annual gross revenue and about $1.5 million in 
profits for the city, according to Jack Fleming of EDS. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockheed Martin IMS estimates red-light cameras in the United  
States will have generated $100 million by 2000. Averaging ticket 
prices and traffic patterns across the country, each camera issues 
a $50 citation every two hours, says the company, which of course 
has a financial interest in promoting the cameras. 
</P>
<P>
	All that money worries the American Automobile Association,  
which believes the job of stopping red-light runners is best left

<HEADLINE> Red Sox Peak in Prime Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- No, they didn't change uniforms. And no, that  
wasn't Manny Ramirez driving in all those runs. 
</P>
<P>
	That really was the Red Sox setting postseason records with 23  
runs and 24 hits against baseball's highest-scoring team since 
1950, the Cleveland Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	And the seven RBIs? Boston's John Valentin got those, not  
Ramirez, whose 165 RBIs were the most in the majors since 1938. 
Valentin did it with two homers, a double and a single, all in the 
first four innings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sure, I had a great night. I'm very happy,'' Valentin said,  
``I'll smile a little bit later, but the team goal is to try to 
win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He had plenty of company as Boston pounded five Cleveland  
pitchers in a 23-7 win Sunday: Trot Nixon and Jose Offerman each 
drove in five runs, Jason Varitek went 4-for-5 with three RBIs and 
a postseason record five runs, and Mike Stanley went 5-for-6. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a great day for a lot of players,'' Valentin said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox hope they have enough strength left to swing the  
bats some more in Monday night's decisive fifth game in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	At least they got there -- on a day in which they outscored 19  
NFL teams. 
</P>
<P>
	A day earlier, that seemed about as unlikely as Valentin getting  
a hit. 
</P>
<P>
	They totaled three runs and 11 hits in losing the first two  
games at Cleveland, and he was 0-for-10 going into the bottom of 
the sixth of Game 3 with the score at 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Then everything changed.  
</P>
<P>
	``Val's a gamer,'' center fielder Darren Lewis said. ``He's  
obsessed with the game. He's into every inning, every pitch, every 
at-bat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Valentin's solo homer put the Red Sox ahead in the sixth inning  
Saturday, but the third baseman's second costly throwing error of 
the series allowed Cleveland to tie the game in the seventh 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	No problem.  
</P>
<P>
	Valentin came up again in the bottom of the seventh and broke  
the tie with a two-run double. That started a six-run inning that 
gave the Red Sox a 9-3 win. 
</P>
<P>
	``These last two games are the most exciting games I've seen in  
a long time,'' said Bret Saberhagen, who will pitch Game 5 on three 
days' rest against Charles Nagy. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, Valentin and the Red Sox earned several lines in next  
year's postseason record book. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything we threw up there they hit,'' Cleveland manager  
Mike Hargrove said. ``When it came down, it wasn't where we were 
standing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The previous record for most runs in a postseason game was 18 by  
the New York Yankees in an 18-4 win over the New York Giants in the 
1936 World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	The previous record for most hits in a postseason game was 22 by  
Atlanta against St. Louis in Game 7 of the 1996 NL championship 
series. 
</P>
<P>
	Valentin's seven RBIs tied the division series record held by  
former teammate Mo Vaughn, who did it in last year's opener at 
Cleveland, and Seattle's Edgar Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
	His 11 total bases broke the division series record of 10 shared  
by Vaughn and Eric Karros of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Valentin accomplished something that may be more amazing.  
</P>
<P>
	He came to bat in each of the last three innings Saturday and  
each of the first four Sunday. In those seven straight appearances, 
he homered, doubled, lined out to right, homered again, singled, 
homered yet again and doubled. 
</P>
<P>
	That added up to four runs and 10 RBIs in a span of just seven  
innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Pretty good for a player who hit just .253 with 12 homers and  
wasn't assured of a spot on the postseason roster until he returned 
from the disabled list on Sept. 23. He went on it Aug. 31 with 
tendinitis in his left knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Rookie Wilton Veras played well in his place. But Valentin  
assured his playoff spot by ending the season with a five-game 
hitting streak and staying healthy. 
</P>
<P>
	He finally was stopped Sunday when he struck out -- swinging, of  
course -- against Sean DePaula in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
	Valentin was due up in the seventh, but with the score 21-6,  
manager Jimy Williams sent up Donnie Sadler to pinch hit. 
</P>
<P>
	Naturally, Sadler doubled.  
</P>
<P>
	``Tonight,'' Valentin said, ``was a special night for the Red  
Sox.''

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Reform Party leaders kept up their sniping at

<P>
	Also, the outgoing Reform Party chairman, Russell Verney, said  
Ross Perot, the party's presidential nominee in 1992 and 1996, has 
not ruled out a third run. 
</P>
<P>
	The loudest voices behind the internal bickering belonged to  
Verney and his successor, Jack Gargan, a Ventura ally who takes 
over Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Verney again pressed for Ventura to quit the party, citing  
comments the former wrestler made in a recent interview in Playboy 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other things, Ventura said organized religion is for  
``weak-minded people'' and that the Navy's Tailhook sexual 
harassment scandal was ``much ado about nothing.'' Ventura later 
said his remarks about religion referred to extremists and has said 
repeatedly since that he doesn't condone the actions at Tailhook. 
</P>
<P>
	Verney, speaking Sunday on NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' said  
Ventura's statements were ``an affront to the values of the members 
of the Reform Party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Gargan wondered why Verney was not condemning Buchanan with  
the same vengeance. A new book by the political commentator argues 
that Adolf Hitler was not a direct threat to the United States 
after 1940, a year before the United States entered World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	``How come we don't hear this righteous indignation that he  
(Buchanan) should be thrown out,'' Gargan asked. 
</P>
<P>
	``First, he's not a member of this party,'' Verney responded.  
``And second, if he's a member of this party and he's embodied as 
the leadership of this party in the public's mind, he will be held 
-- everyone will be held to the same standard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both Gargan and Ventura questioned whether the organization  
should nominate Buchanan. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very different on social issues,'' Ventura said on ABC's  
``This Week.'' ``Mr. Buchanan likes to put social issues to the 
forefront. We in the Reform Party traditionally have never done 
that, and I agree with that. I don't like putting social issues out 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Buchanan and Trump talk about seeking the Reform  
nomination, Verney said party founder Perot has not ruled out 
another presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ross Perot is one of the most effective communicators in  
America,'' Verney said on CNN's ``Late Edition.''

<HEADLINE> 'Kato' Kaelin Settles Libel Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The man who became the nation's most famous  
house guest during the O.J. Simpson murder trial, Brian ``Kato'' 
Kaelin, has settled his $15 million libel lawsuit over the National 
Examiner's headline: ``Cops Think Kato Did It!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kaelin's lawyer, Gary Bostwick, wouldn't say how much Globe  
Communications Corp. agreed to pay. The settlement was entered into 
federal court records Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaelin was Simpson's house guest when the former football star's  
ex-wife and her friend were stabbed to death in 1994. Simpson was 
acquitted of criminal charges but later found liable in a civil 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Examiner headline ran a week after Simpson was  
acquitted. 
</P>
<P>
	While the tabloid argued that it never accused Kaelin of murder  
and ``it'' in the headline meant perjury, a federal appeals court 
last year ruled that the headline alone could be grounds for libel.

<HEADLINE> NY Cardinal Too Weak for Mass </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Radiation therapy left Cardinal John O'Connor,  
spiritual leader of New York's 2.2 million Catholics for the past 
15 years, too weak to celebrate Mass at St. Patrick's Cathedral on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first service he had missed since having a brain  
tumor removed last month. 
</P>
<P>
	``I used to think that I knew what it was to be tired. After  
having received all but the final radiation treatment, I now 
realize that at my most exhausted, I could have run the marathon in 
comparison with the tiredness that can come with radiation 
treatment,'' O'Connor said in a statement read Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The cardinal, who has said he does not have cancer, has been  
receiving radiation treatment since the surgery. He has said he 
plans to retire when turns 80 in January. 
</P>
<P>
	``Advising you of my exhaustion has little to do, as such, with  
my surgery. It has everything to do with the post-operative 
radiation,'' the statement said. ``Although my pride does not 
accept delays in getting back to work fully, God always has the 
last word. I hope to see you next Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The cardinal's spokesman, Joe Zwilling, said O'Connor ``has been  
unfailingly positive'' and ``in exceptionally good humor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He would not comment on the cardinal's medical prognosis.

<HEADLINE> Lynch Goes for More Tender Approach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- What could the director of such dark and moody  
films as ``Eraserhead'' and ``The Elephant Man'' possibly see in 
the tale of an old man who rides his lawn mower across Iowa? 
</P>
<P>
	Tenderness, says David Lynch, the director of the new Disney  
film ``The Straight Story,'' due out Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I responded to the emotion in it,'' Lynch says in The New York  
Times' Sunday editions. ``Then I felt it would be the correct thing 
to do. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt its yearning for pure, intense feeling represented  
something that was in the air. I don't know what's in the air is 
also a desire to have a break from sex and violence or, rather, a 
yearning for more tender, more direct storytelling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lynch isn't the only filmmaker to break from dark plot twists  
recently to spin one to a family audience: David Mamet's ``The 
Winslow Boy'' is a British period piece about a penny crime and the 
legal chaos that follows, and Wim Wenders' ``Buena Vista Social 
Club'' is an uplifting concert movie.

<HEADLINE> Mich. St. Gets Big Boost From Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	How big was Michigan State's win over Michigan?  
</P>
<P>
	Big enough for the Spartans to leap into the top five of The  
Associated Press' Top 25 college football poll for the first time 
in 32 years. 
</P>
<P>
	With its 34-31 win over the Wolverines on Saturday, Michigan  
State (6-0) jumped six places to No. 5 in this week's AP poll. 
Michigan (5-1), meanwhile, fell seven spots to No. 10. 
</P>
<P>
	It also marks the first time the Spartans have been ranked in  
the top 10 since finishing the 1987 season at No. 8. The last time 
Michigan State cracked the top 5 was a No. 3 ranking on Sept. 18, 
1967. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State (6-0) and Penn State (6-0) remained 1-2 for the  
fourth straight week following balloting Sunday by the 70 sports 
writers and broadcasters on the AP panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Nebraska (6-0), a 49-14 winner over Iowa State, moved up one  
spot to No. 3, followed by No. 4 Virginia Tech and Michigan State. 
Mo. 6 Tennessee, No. 7 Florida, No. 8 Georgia Tech, No. 9 Kansas 
State and Michigan rounded out the top 10. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seminoles, who beat Miami 31-21 on Saturday, had 63  
first-place votes and 1,743 points, while the Nittany Lions, 31-7 
winners over Iowa, had six first-place votes and 1,678 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Virginia Tech (5-0), which routed Rutgers 58-20, had the other  
first-place vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Alabama was No. 11, followed by No. 12 Mississippi State, No. 13  
Texas A&AMP;M, No. 14 Georgia, No. 15 Marshall, No. 16 Syracuse, No. 17 
Wisconsin, No. 18 Ohio State, No. 19 Texas, No. 20 Purdue, No. 21 
BYU, No. 22 Mississippi, No. 23 East Carolina, No. 24 Miami and No. 
25 Southern Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia fell four places after its 37-20 loss to Tennessee.  
</P>
<P>
	Mississippi and Southern Mississippi, the two new entries this  
week, join Mississippi State in the AP poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota and Southern California dropped out of the Top 25.  
With USC gone, the Pac-10 has no teams in this week's Top 25. 
</P>
<P>
	In the USA Today/ESPN coaches' poll, the top 5 are: Florida  
State, Penn State, Nebraska, Virginia Tech and Tennessee.

<HEADLINE> AFL-CIO To Offer Members Web Access </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Card-carrying union members soon will have  
access to a special Internet gateway designed to connect workers 
with one another, address labor-related issues and serve as a 
high-tech organizing tool, the AFL-CIO said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will be a revolutionary tool for communications,'' said  
Morton Bahr, president of the Communications Workers of America. 
``Can you imagine being able to ask millions of Internet users to 
boycott a product or bombard an elected official with protests?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Web site, which is scheduled to be up and running by Dec. 1,  
is an attempt to create an electronic community for the AFL-CIO's 
68 affiliated unions. The AFL-CIO also was to announce Monday a 
program that will offer affordable computers and Internet access to 
union members. 
</P>
<P>
	The union plans to make Internet access available to union  
members for no more than $14.95 a month, said Ray Abernathy, an 
AFL-CIO spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Union members will be able to finance the purchase of a computer  
for as low as $600, union officials said. The goal is to bring 
families online for less than $30 a month, Abernathy said. 
</P>
<P>
	``With workingfamilies.com, we're helping bridge the growing gap  
between the technological 'haves' and 'have-nots,' and we're also 
giving working families new ways to connect with one another and to 
make their voices heard,'' said John Sweeney, AFL-CIO president. 
</P>
<P>
	Labor officials hope the portal site will become an electronic  
meeting place for the AFL-CIO's 13 million union members and a 
high-tech organizing tool.

<HEADLINE> Sprewell Explains Absence From Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Latrell Sprewell finally offered a feeble  
explanation Sunday for missing the first week of training camp, and 
the New York Knicks decided to bench him for their first exhibition 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without any practice time, he's just not going to be ready to  
play,'' said coach Jeff Van Gundy, who met with Sprewell and 
general manager Scott Layden for 45 minutes Sunday morning at the 
team's practice facility. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell said he had simply ignored the Knicks' phone messages  
as he drove across the country, doing a 36-hour stretch solo from 
Oakland to Milwaukee, arriving before dawn Wednesday, and then 
continuing on to New York on Thursday with his brother and a 
friend. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell nonchalantly explained that he drove instead of taking  
a flight because he wanted to pick up some things in Milwaukee and 
he wanted to be sure that his car, a Mercedes-Benz sedan, made it 
to New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's just me. I like doing things myself,'' he said. ``I  
wasn't trying to send a message.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for ignoring calls from the Knicks, who were wondering what  
he was doing, he said, ``That's what agents are for.'' Yet Sprewell 
admitted that he did not keep in close contact with his agent, 
Robert Gist. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy and Layden refused to divulge many details of the  
meeting, but they did disclose that the team had fined Sprewell 
``an appropriate and significant'' amount for failing to join the 
team for training camp in Charleston, S.C. If they fine him for all 
the practices he missed, it would total $40,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the Knicks had the day off Sunday. Sprewell will  
join them for his first practice -- it will be the team's 10th -- on 
Monday at Madison Square Garden before the team holds a public 
scrimmage. Sprewell will not play in the exhibition opener Tuesday 
night in Uniondale, N.Y., against the Philadelphia 76ers, but he is 
not officially suspended. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how our team is going to react,'' Van Gundy said.  
``I think Latrell most likely will need to address the situation to 
his teammates, and how the team from the inside handles it will be 
between them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell said his lateness had nothing to do with his contract  
situation. Entering the final year of a four-year deal that will 
pay him $9 million this season, Sprewell is eligible to sign an 
extension during the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Madison Square Garden president Dave Checketts said over the  
summer that the Knicks were eager to begin discussing an extension, 
although it is unclear now if the Knicks will be a little more 
reluctant to commit as much as $60 or $70 million to Sprewell in a 
long-term deal. 
</P>
<P>
	What also remains to be seen is how this episode affects  
Sprewell's relationship with Van Gundy following a season in which 
they didn't see eye to eye on the question of whether Sprewell 
should have been a starter or a sixth man. Van Gundy didn't move 
Sprewell into the starting lineup until the Eastern Conference 
finals against Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think relationships are important unless they affect  
performance,'' Van Gundy said. `Performance and winning is what 
we're about, and to do that there's certain commitments and 
responsibilities that everybody has to submit to. This is not just 
about one person, it's everybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For now, Sprewell, Layden and Van Gundy are keeping details of  
their discussion private, hoping that the controversy will blow 
over so they can move forward. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to share my thoughts,'' Van Gundy said. ``I  
shared them with him, and I think that's what's appropriate.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Industrial Area to Double </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- Jordan's largest duty-free industrial zone  
plans to double its capacity to meet demand from customers in the 
United States and Europe, an official said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Al-Hassan Qualified Industrial Zone comprises 83 companies  
and factories, employing 5,000 people. It will double its size 
early next year to keep up with customer requirements, QIZ 
director-general Mohammed Itmeh said. 
</P>
<P>
	The zone, located 54 miles north of the capital, Amman, near the  
city of Irbid, was established two years ago by Jordan-Israel joint 
ventures. Its products are exempt from U.S. taxes and customs 
duties. 
</P>
<P>
	Itmeh said that last year the QIZ exported and sold goods worth  
$507 million, 60 percent of which was sold to U.S. and European 
markets. Its products are mainly clothes, food, textiles, 
engineering goods, plastic, rubber, chemical products, and luggage.

<HEADLINE> GOP Lawmaker Criticize Bush </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Republican lawmaker said Sunday that  
continued attacks by George W. Bush could hurt him on Capitol Hill 
should the GOP front-runner become president. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope that he doesn't get in a mode of attacking those of us  
in the majority party who are working very hard to do the people's 
business and then expect to come to the Washington as the president 
and work with us,'' Rep. Ray LaHood, R-Ill., said on CBS's ``Face 
the Nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Jimmy Carter tried that when he was elected president, running  
against the Congress and couldn't get anything done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, in what was widely seen as an opportunity to move to the  
political middle, recently criticized the House Republicans' plan 
to alter a tax credit for the working poor in order to help balance 
the budget. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after that, a second GOP presidential contender, Sen.  
John McCain, joined in, saying lawmakers were picking on the 
working poor rather than special interest groups that contribute 
money to the party. 
</P>
<P>
	LaHood, who has endorsed Bush and helped raise campaign funds,  
said such comments would not lay the groundwork for positive 
relations between Congress and a Bush White House. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those of us who support George Bush want him to do well,''  
LaHood said. ``But we also want to be part of that winning team. 
You don't do it by knocking those of us who are working 12 to 14 
hours a day trying to do the people's business in Washington. If he 
has differences with us as the majority party, we ought to sit down 
in a closed door room and talk about them. We are not trying to 
balance the budget on the backs of the poor. That simply is not 
true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GOP presidential hopeful Gary Bauer said Bush was talking like a  
liberal Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
	``When does the governor start attacking Al Gore or Ted Kennedy  
or the Democratic Party?'' Bauer said on CBS' ``Face the Nation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks to me like he's trying to get the nomination of the  
Democratic party, devoting his energy to attacking good Republican 
conservatives. He's the front-runner in the party. If he has a 
problem with something going on in Congress, pick up the phone and 
say something about it, but don't provide fodder for the Democrats 
to use in 2000 to defeat our party,'' Bauer said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bush campaign did not immediately respond Sunday to a  
request for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the criticism from Bush and McCain, Rep. Tom DeLay of  
Texas, the third-ranking House Republican, said on NBC's ``Meet the 
Press'' that House GOP leaders still were considering the tax 
credit change.

<HEADLINE> White House Hopefuls Lobby for Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *Associated Press Writer-    	
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The urgent calls to United Food and  
Commercial Workers President Doug Dority came back-to-back -- Vice 
President Al Gore on Friday, Bill Bradley on Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The candidates' personal appeals were, other union officials  
said, pretty typical of the last-minute lobbying over the AFL-CIO 
endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
	Dority's reply to each was just as typical of the dynamic at  
work on the eve of the 13-million-member labor federation's 
biennial convention: I will support Al Gore, but ... 
</P>
<P>
	``Doug is leaning towards the view that an endorsement a couple  
of months from now may be the most impactful way to proceed,'' said 
Greg Denier, Dority's senior assistant. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a matter of practical, political consideration that there  
has to be some consensus building and on the question of early 
endorsement, obviously there's not consensus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the issue seemed settled to AFL-CIO President John Sweeney,  
who said Sunday he expected the labor federation to back Gore. 
``The delegates to the convention are moving toward an 
endorsement,'' Sweeney said on ABC's ``This Week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, interviews with several labor operatives suggest  
agreement that Gore waited too long to place his calls to key labor 
leaders and seal their support for an early nod. In the meantime, 
Bradley and his top operatives -- campaign manager Gina Glantz and 
strategist Will Robinson, both with their own long, professional 
ties to organized labor -- aggressively worked the phones. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley's message -- ``All I'm asking is that you give me some  
time'' before going with Gore -- began to stick, especially among 
labor leaders committed to letting the decision come from members 
not yet focused on the 2000 election. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that Bradley is closing in on -- or edging ahead of -- Gore in  
the key states of New Hampshire and New York, Gore allies fear 
another delay in the AFL-CIO endorsement that they have sought 
since February would be too big a blow to his already flagging 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Gore wouldn't get it, I think it would be very, very  
harmful to Gore,'' acknowledged Gerald McEntee, president of the 
American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, and 
Gore's chief backer at the convention. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bill Bradley and his folks have worked very hard. If there is  
an endorsement, Bradley is hurt, but not as much,'' McEntee said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sept. 27, both campaigns made separate presentations to the  
AFL-CIO's executive council, the 15 to 20 presidents of the largest 
affiliated unions, in a suite at the Hay-Adams Hotel across from 
the White House. Both camps showed slides of their polling data, 
fund raising, organizational structure and strategies for winning 
both the Democratic nomination as well as the general election. 
</P>
<P>
	One Gore ally present for both sessions, speaking on condition  
of anonymity, called Bradley's presentation ``surprisingly 
credible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Gore's problem, if you were to ask him and he were to be  
honest with you, is that the campaign underestimated how hard this 
(endorsement) would be and sort of took it for granted,'' Teamsters 
political director Michael Mathis said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the week or so leading up to the convention, not only did  
Gore hit the phones, but campaign chairman Tony Coelho enlisted the 
top Democrat in the House, Richard Gephardt of Missouri -- about as 
pure a labor hero as the Democrats have -- to make some calls, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the huge chore of moving Gore's campaign from Washington  
to Tennessee in the space of one week, Coelho and campaign manager 
Donna Brazile flew to the convention in hopes of solidifying 
support. 
</P>
<P>
	Sweeney was pressing Gore's case Sunday in a round of one-on-one  
meetings with reluctant union presidents. Bradley aides closely 
monitored the backroom wrangling from his New Jersey headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerry Shea, governmental affairs assistant to Sweeney, said Gore  
has gotten a bum rap and, given how hard he has worked -- in the 
White House and in Congress before then -- to advance labor 
interests, should not have been expected to work so hard for an 
endorsement that many view as inevitable still. 
</P>
<P>
	``The union presidents wanted to be asked, every president  
wanted to be called,'' said Shea. ``People were holding him to a 
higher standard.''

<HEADLINE> Hyundai May Build Plant in N.Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Hyundai group officials will visit  
North Korea this week to discuss a plan to build a large-scale 
industrial park in the reclusive communist country, company 
officials said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 20-member delegation will arrive in the North on Saturday  
for a 10-day visit to conduct field research on several candidate 
towns on North Korea's southwest coast, close to border with South 
Korea, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement was made after Chung Ju-yung, founder and  
honorary chairman of the Hyundai group, received approval for the 
plan from North Korean leader Kim Jong Il during his five-day visit 
to the North earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyundai plans to relocate 800 to 900 garment plants, assembly  
plants for cars, televisions and other electronic products and use 
surplus South Korean electricity for the factories. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan reflects the growing business links between North Korea  
and the largest South Korean conglomerate. Under a $942 million 
deal, Hyundai launched a sightseeing cruise of a scenic North 
Korean mountain in November. 
</P>
<P>
	Relations between the two Koreas remain largely frozen because  
of political and military tensions. They are still technically at 
war, having signed no peace treaty at the end of the 1950-53 Korean 
War.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Serbs May Withdraw Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) -- The Bosnian Serb Assembly  
on Sunday endorsed a proposal to withdraw a lawsuit against 
Yugoslavia for aggression and genocide in connection with the 
1992-95 ethnic war here. 
</P>
<P>
	The case was filed by the Sarajevo government six years ago in  
the World Court in The Hague. At the time, the government was 
Muslim-dominated. 
</P>
<P>
	After signing of the 1995 Dayton peace accord, the country was  
divided into two entities -- the Bosnian Serbs' ``Republika Srpska'' 
and the Muslim-Croat Federation. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the Bosnian Serbs want to withdraw the suit.  
</P>
<P>
	A session of the Bosnian Serb Assembly was called by the Bosnian  
Serb member of the multiethnic Bosnian presidency, Zivko Radisic. 
</P>
<P>
	The Muslim members of the Assembly said voting on this matter  
was unconstitutional and left the session. Later, a 61-8 vote 
declared the lawsuit was ``destructive for the life and vital 
interests of Republika Srpska and all Serb people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bosnian radio in Sarajevo linked the decision by the Assembly to  
a visit by Radisic and other Bosnian Serbs to Belgrade, where they 
met with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	A statement issued in Belgrade after the meeting said officials  
discussed the implementation of peace and economic and cultural 
cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Only those naive citizens really believe they discussed  
culture,'' Bosnian radio said Sunday. Milosevic, it claimed, was 
using the Bosnian Serbs to get rid of the lawsuit against him.

<HEADLINE> Dispute Over Minority Judges Grows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The volatile mix of ideology, politics and  
race has given new prominence to the long-simmering dispute between 
the White House and the Republican Senate over confirmation of 
President Clinton's choices for federal judgeships. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Senate rejected a black nominee for the federal bench  
on a strict party-line vote, Clinton called the action a disgrace. 
And he did not let the matter drop. He repeated his criticism over 
the weekend in a speech to a Hispanic group and cited the case of 
Richard Paez, a Mexican-American, nominated for a federal appeals 
court vacancy more than three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am deeply dissatisfied with the Senate's partisan handling  
of some of my minority nominees,'' Clinton said at the annual 
meeting of the national Hispanic Leadership Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans angrily counter that race has not been a factor in  
the holdup of the Paez nomination or the rejection of the 
nomination of Ronnie White, the first black to sit on the Missouri 
Supreme Court, for a federal judgeship. Nominated by Clinton 27 
months ago, White was turned down on a 54-45 vote -- all Republicans 
voting to reject the nomination and all Democrats supporting it. 
</P>
<P>
	White's detractors, led by Missouri's two Republican senators,  
argued he was opposed by law enforcement groups because he had too 
often dissented on death penalty rulings. 
</P>
<P>
	Missouri law enforcement officers, said Sen. John Ashcroft,  
R-Mo., ``are entitled to judges who will enforce the law as it is 
written, and not reach for loopholes that benefit criminals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Angry Democrats, however, said Republicans had distorted White's  
record on capital punishment. Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle 
of South Dakota called it a ``dark day'' in the Senate. ``The vote 
tells minority judicial candidates, 'do not apply.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Lott, R-Miss., shot back that Clinton had ``impugned the  
integrity'' of the Senate and ``should be ashamed'' of his 
suggestion that race played a part in GOP votes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate's second-ranked Republican, Sen. Don Nickles of  
Oklahoma, asked whether Democrats had applied a ``color test'' in 
1991 when they voted against Clarence Thomas' nomination to the 
Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	In his speech to the Hispanic Leadership Conference, Clinton  
alluded to the political stakes when he told the group that America 
increasingly ``will look like you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To warm applause, Clinton said Saturday that Hispanics are  
moving quickly ``into the mainstream of American life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The national Hispanic population of 31 million is expected to  
overtake the non-Hispanic black population to become the largest 
minority group by the end of 2004. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats have long contended that Republicans use political  
stalling tactics to keep Clinton nominees off the federal bench, 
and that minority and women nominees have fared the worst. 
Republicans respond that trouble occurs only when Clinton nominates 
candidates who are unacceptably liberal. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats cite recent findings by the bipartisan Constitution  
Project that the Senate during the 1997-98 session took an average 
186 days either to accept or reject white nominees, but 246 days 
for minorities. Moreover, the rejection rate was 14 percent for the 
92 white, and 35 percent for the 31 minority nominees. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, after a stormy debate, Frederica Massiah-Jackson  
withdrew her nomination to be the first black woman to sit on the 
federal bench in Philadelphia just days before a Senate vote she 
was likely to lose. Senate Republicans said she was soft on crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Wade Henderson of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights said  
that while minorities and women may face obstacles because they 
tend to be more liberal than the average white male judge, there 
still ``appears to be a double standard'' in the Senate's handling 
of nominees such as White. 
</P>
<P>
	Just before the White vote, Latino groups joined Democrats to  
demand action on two nominees to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, 
Paez and San Francisco attorney Marsha Berzon. Paez has been in 
limbo longer than any other nominee, and Berzon since January 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, the Judiciary Committee chairman  
responsible for moving judge nominations through the Senate, noted 
that 45 percent of the judicial nominees reported to the Senate 
floor this year have been women or minorities.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Warns Wash. State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) -- If Washington state doesn't become more  
friendly to business, Boeing may take its future ventures -- and 
jobs -- somewhere else, a top executive of the state's largest 
private employer warned. 
</P>
<P>
	In blunt words, Debby Hopkins, Boeing's chief financial officer,  
said Washington doesn't stack up to most other places where Boeing 
has plants. And while Boeing was founded in Seattle and its 
employees love the quality of life here, the company can't afford 
to be sentimental. 
</P>
<P>
	``Compared to everywhere else we do business, Washington is  
below average,'' Hopkins said Friday. ``To remain a global leader 
for aerospace -- and a global leader for other industries -- 
Washington has to rank a whole lot higher than that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said Washington companies suffer from high unemployment  
taxes, government fees and a lack of plans to improve education, 
infrastructure and promote business. 
</P>
<P>
	Things will only get worse, she said, if voters approve  
Initiative 695, a measure on the November ballot to cut the state's 
vehicle excise tax to a flat $30 fee and to require voter approval 
of all new state or local fees or taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure would cut more than $2.4 billion from the state's  
transportation budgets over the next six years, she said. That 
would make already snarled traffic worse, crippling companies that 
need to ship goods and get employees to work, and the burden of 
making up the lost taxes would ultimately fall on business, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hopkins spoke to the Greater Seattle Chamber of Commerce's  
annual leadership conference in Spokane. She reminded the audience 
that at a similar gathering eight years ago, former Boeing Chairman 
Frank Shrontz shook business and government leaders with the 
warning that Puget Sound could turn into ``an aerospace rust 
belt,'' if they didn't help Boeing stay competitive. 
</P>
<P>
	``There have been some changes since Frank Shrontz made that  
speech,'' Hopkins said. ``But not enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hopkins said Boeing wants the state to be a leading aerospace  
center, as well as a global leader in software, trade, 
biotechnology, agriculture and other business. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have deep roots in this community. But we also have deep  
roots elsewhere. We have major investments in communities like St. 
Louis, Southern California, Mesa, Wichita, El Paso, Salt Lake City, 
Toronto and Brisbane, Australia. Just to name a few.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hopkins, who joined Boeing last year, has been leading the  
company's effort to improve its profitability. Although it's 
unlikely Boeing would abandon its massive aircraft assembly plants 
in the Seattle area, there are not many incentives to expand 
further in the region, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing employs 202,000 people worldwide, with only about 81,000  
in Washington. Because of its merger with McDonnell Douglas and 
acquisition of Rockwell's aerospace units, it finds itself with too 
many underutilized plants, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a recent Boeing study on the cost of doing business,  
Washington came out 16th among the 27 states where Boeing has 
plants and employees. Washington only managed that rating because 
of historically low energy rates, Hopkins said. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we look at where to grow our business, we'll look  
everywhere: around the country, around the globe,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to grow in Washington. Unfortunately, right now,  
Washington isn't a top competitor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Washington has the fourth-highest unemployment insurance tax in  
the nation, nearly three times the national average, she said, and 
ranks ninth of all 50 states in fees and assessments on business. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our labor costs in Washington are among the highest in the  
nation,'' she said. ``When you add it up, it's not the best 
environment for business.''

<HEADLINE> 600 Gather at Matthew Shepard Vigil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- About 600 people gathered Sunday night for  
a candelight vigil honoring Matthew Shepard, the gay college 
student who was fatally beaten and tied to a post a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``We on this campus, in Laramie and in Wyoming, are people of  
peace, of inclusiveness,'' the Rev. Roger Schmit, of St. Paul's 
Newman Center, told people on the University of Wyoming campus. 
</P>
<P>
	One of two men accused in the slaying, Aaron McKinney, 22, goes  
on trial Monday on charges of first-degree murder, kidnapping and 
aggravated robbery. 
</P>
<P>
	The other suspect, Russell Henderson, 22, pleaded guilty in  
April to felony murder and kidnapping and received two life 
sentences. 
</P>
<P>
	Shepard, 21, was lured from a bar Oct. 7, 1998, driven to a  
remote prairie, tied to a fence, pistol-whipped into 
unconsciousness and left to die on the freezing plains. 
</P>
<P>
	He died on Oct. 12, 1998, and McKinney's trial begins amid  
several memorials commemorating the one-year anniversary of his 
death.

<HEADLINE> Astros Hope New Stadium Brings Luck </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- It all seems so familiar: another division title,  
another playoffs flop. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe a change of scenery will help the Houston Astros, who move  
from the Astrodome to Enron Field next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll be glad to leave the Astrodome,'' pitcher Jose Lima said.  
``I don't know if it's a curse or not. It's nothing against the 
Astrodome but we don't want to come back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Why?  
</P>
<P>
	``We don't win here in the playoffs,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	After fighting through an injury-and-illness filled season to  
win their third straight NL Central title, the Astros repeated 
their postseason disappearing act. The Killer B's -- Craig Biggio, 
Derek Bell and Jeff Bagwell -- combined to hit .143 (5-for-35) with 
no RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I refuse to say it's choking,'' Bagwell said. ``All I can tell  
you guys is I did the best I could. I just didn't get the hits when 
I needed to. But one thing you've got to understand is it's not 
that easy to get here. We're a winning team. We've won three 
division titles and we'll come through sooner or later.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta swept the Astros in 1997, and San Diego beat Houston in  
four games last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure if we get in next year, the stigma we came in with  
this year will come in even greater,'' Astros manager Larry Dierker 
said. ``I don't see any reason why that can't be turned around, but 
the hard thing is having to spend six more months to try to get 
back in again. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes, a team will get in once and go all the way, and in  
our case, we've been in three years in a row and we haven't made it 
past the first step.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It will be another year's wait, too, for Bagwell and Biggio.  
</P>
<P>
	``You can say whatever you want about Baggy and me not  
hitting,'' Biggio said. ``But we came a long way during the season 
and it's a team thing. It wasn't for any lack of effort.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bagwell, a contender for MVP in the regular season, is a career  
.304 hitter but he's only hitting .128 in the playoffs. Bagwell hit 
42 homers and stole 30 bases in the regular season, joining Barry 
Bonds as the only players to accomplish the feat twice in major 
league history. 
</P>
<P>
	Biggio led the majors with 56 doubles and became the first NL  
player since Joe Medwick in 1937 to hit 56 doubles. Biggio is a 
.292 career hitter in the regular season but only .119 in the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell slumped to .236 this season and played in only one game  
against the Braves. He's hitting .094 for the Astros in the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite their playoff failure, the Astros head into the  
offseason with a positive feeling about the difficulties they 
overcame to win the division on the final day of the regular 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Astros had 14 players spend time on the disabled list  
including two, Ricky Gutierrez and Jack Howell, who were there 
twice. Biggio and Bagwell were the only opening day starters who 
didn't go on the DL. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston played the the entire season with All-Star left fielder  
Moises Alou, who hurt a knee before spring training. His 
replacement, Richard Hidalgo, missed the final two months with an 
inflamed left knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Third baseman Ken Caminiti hobbled through much of the season  
with a strained right calf muscle and didn't blossom until the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the staff got hurt.  
</P>
<P>
	Dierker collapsed in the dugout from a seizure on June 13 and  
had brain surgery to malformed blood vessels. Hitting coach Tom 
McCraw took a three-month leave for treatment of prostate cancer 
and first-base coach Jose Cruz missed 34 games while receiving 
treatment for an irregular heart beat. 
</P>
<P>
	The Astros survived on a strong 1-2-3 pitching rotation of Mike  
Hampton (22-4), Lima (21-10) and Shane Reynolds (16-14) and closer 
Mike Wagner (39 saves). Scott Elarton and Jose Cabrera showed great 
promise. 
</P>
<P>
	Hampton's 22 victories broke the previous franchise record of  
21, set by Joe Niekro in 1979. The Astros hit 168 homers, a club 
record, and they drew a franchise record 2,706,017 fans at home. 
</P>
<P>
	``We came up a little short but I think we're getting more out  
of our players' abilities,'' general manager Gerry Hunsicker said. 
``But unless we're able to step up and get a couple more players, 
it will be hard to take the next step. I think we've been the 
underdogs and as long as the other teams are spending $10 million 
and $20 million more than we are, it's hard to think we won't 
continue to be the underdogs.''

<HEADLINE> Study: Machine Tool Spending Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Spending on machine tools in August fell 1.5  
percent from the previous month and was down 11 percent from the 
year-ago August, according to a study by two industry groups 
released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies spent an estimated $435 million for machine tools in  
August, the Association for Manufacturing Technology and the 
American Machine Tool Distributors' Association said in a joint 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	That fell well short of the $442 million for July and the $489  
million spent in August 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Year to date, machine tool consumption is down 35 percent from  
the same period a year ago, totaling $3.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``The year-on-year decline has slowed somewhat as traditional  
markets, such as autos, prop up the market,'' said Don F. Carlson, 
AMT president. ``However, a bottom to this downturn rests with 
calming customers' apprehensions on consumer spending and with a 
building on the fragile recovery in Asia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts consider demand for machine tools a reliable indicator  
of the strength of the manufacturing sector and the overall 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Statistics are compiled from figures submitted by companies  
participating in the U.S. Machine Tool Consumption report.

	When Williams arrived at Fenway Park before the game, he left  
Garciaparra, who is nursing a bruised right wrist, out of his 
starting lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	Then Garciaparra showed up, tested his wrist and decided he  
could play against Cleveland, after all. So Williams wasted little 
time making room in his lineup for the AL batting champion. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I know is, he came into my office and said he was ready to  
play,'' Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
	So he put Garciaparra at shortstop and removed backup Lou  
Merloni, who was due to bat sixth. Garciaparra took his usual 
cleanup spot, and first baseman Mike Stanley was dropped to sixth. 
</P>
<P>
	Garciaparra went 1-for-3 before Merloni pinch-hit for him in the  
sixth with Boston leading 18-6. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox lost the first two games of the best-of-5 division  
series with Garciaparra. He went 2-for-3 with a homer in Game 1 but 
was 0-for-3 in Game 2. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox avoided a sweep with a 9-3 win Saturday. Merloni,  
who spent most of the season at Triple-A Pawtucket, went 2-for-3 
with a run and an RBI. 
</P>
<P>
	Garciaparra, hurt when hit by a pitch from Baltimore's Al Reyes  
on Sept. 25, led the AL with a .357 batting average. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians ``have to think about'' pitching against  
Garciaparra, Boston second baseman Jose Offerman said. ``It's 
something they were talking about (Saturday) when they found out he 
wasn't in the lineup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams didn't put him in originally.  
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't want to put a lot of added pressure on this kid,''  
the manager said. ``The trainer taped his wrist and he went out the 
tunnel, and after he got done hitting, he came back and said he 
could play. So I changed the lineup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams wasn't worried that Garciaparra might sustain  
additional damage. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there was any doubt in my mind that I'd be hurting this  
kid,'' Williams said, ``then I wouldn't put him in there in the 
first place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garciaparra missed the last five regular-season games after  
playing in the opener of a doubleheader at the Chicago White Sox in 
which Boston clinched the wild-card berth. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston's other injured star, pitcher Pedro Martinez, reported  
improvement after throwing for eight minutes before Sunday's game. 
On Saturday, the Cy Young Award shoo-in stopped throwing after 
about one minute after experiencing discomfort from a strained 
muscle beneath the right shoulder blade he hurt in the opener. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't hurt the kid,'' said Williams, who plans to start  
Bret Saberhagen in Game 5. ``Just don't think it's wise to start 
him. I don't even know if he can pitch at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got to wait,'' Martinez said. ``I just hope the way I  
threw for eight minutes today, I can throw for eight more from the 
mound'' Monday.

<HEADLINE> Garciaparra Late Addition to Lineup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Red Sox manager Jimy Williams arrived at Fenway  
Park on Sunday, thought about a lineup and decided to leave injured 
Nomar Garciaparra out of it. 
</P>
<P>
	Then Garciaparra showed up, tested his bruised right wrist and  
decided he could play against Cleveland, after all. So Williams 
wasted little time making room in his lineup for the AL batting

after about one minute before Saturday's game after experiencing 
discomfort from a strained muscle beneath his right shoulder blade 
that he hurt in the opener. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams preferred to focus on Sunday's game rather than look  
ahead to a possible fifth game in Cleveland and whether Martinez 
could pitch in it. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's all I can focus on,'' Williams told reporters. ``When I  
was a little kid, I liked to play marbles. A lot of you people 
think I've lost mine. I don't know. I still got them at home in a 
big old brandy snifter. I really do.''

<HEADLINE> Packers Retire White's Jersey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- Reggie White left the game much more  
quietly than he played it. 
</P>
<P>
	White, the controversial but sublimely talented defensive end  
who retired last season, was honored by the Green Bay Packers on 
Sunday night with a jersey retirement ceremony at halftime of the 
Packers' game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers at Lambeau Field. 
</P>
<P>
	White is the fifth player to have his jersey retired by the  
Packers, and the first since 1983. He joins Don Hutson, Tony 
Canadeo, Bart Starr and Ray Nitschke. 
</P>
<P>
	Packers GM Ron Wolf introduced White by simply saying, ``Reggie  
White, legend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White wept openly as his framed jersey was unveiled to chants of  
``Reg-gie!'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I have been privileged to be a part of this,'' White said. ``I  
will always be a Green Bay Packer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Green Bay mayor Paul Jadin renamed his city ``White Bay'' for 24  
hours, and Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson declared Reggie White Day 
in the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the game, White ran to the center of the field to the  
raucous cheers of the sellout crowd. He also participated in the 
pregame coin toss with the Packers' captains. 
</P>
<P>
	White was elected to the Pro bowl a record 13 straight times  
from 1986-98. He was the NFL's Defensive Player of the Year in 1987 
and 1998, and he is football's career sacks leader with 192.5. 
</P>
<P>
	He joined the Packers as an unrestricted free agent in 1993,  
automatically endearing himself to the legions of Packers fans who 
thought their small-town team couldn't get big-name talent. White 
is the Packers' career sacks leader with 68.5, and he played a 
large role in leading Green Bay to its Super Bowl win in January 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he came to fame as the pre-eminent defensive lineman of  
his era, White was just as notorious for several years of 
statements which were widely viewed as sexist, homophobic and 
racist. White is an ordained minister who has publicly opposed gay 
marriage and women reporters in the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
	White had stirred a minor controversy earlier in the week when  
he said he would have preferred to be honored on Nov. 1, when 
former Packers coach Mike Holmgren brings his Seattle Seahawks to 
Lambeau Field for a Monday night game. 
</P>
<P>
	White also said the NFL tends to honor black stars less  
flamboyantly than white players like John Elway, whose retirement 
ceremony was held by the Broncos earlier this season. White later 
backed away from that remark.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Eyes Rebound With Films </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Actress Carol Cheng's nickname was ``Cheng:  
Nine Projects.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She didn't do nine movies a year. That was the average number of  
films she was involved in on any given day at the height of her 
career -- and that of Hong Kong's film industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``There used to be checks waiting for me at production  
companies. They were mine if I wanted to sign,'' she says. 
</P>
<P>
	Those checks stopped flowing when the Asian economic crisis  
struck and the Hong Kong film industry found itself overburdened 
with debt piled up in producing too many mediocre movies for the 
market to bear. 
</P>
<P>
	Film production dried up. Hong Kong made just 92 films last  
year, compared with 200 at its peak in 1993. The industry now 
supports just 1,000 people, instead of 8,000 before the financial 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	But the city's film industry -- where Hollywood actors Jackie  
Chan, Sammo Hung, Michelle Yeoh, Chow Yun-fat and Jet Li and 
director John Woo got their starts -- is showing a few signs of 
life. 
</P>
<P>
	Several local blockbusters, such as ``A Man Called Hero'' and  
``Gen X Cops,'' packed people into theaters over the summer, and 
U.S. film companies have bought North American distribution rights 
for both. 
</P>
<P>
	With the region's financial crisis abating, many are asking if  
Hong Kong movies are ready for a revival. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's awakening, but there's still a long way to go,'' says  
Raymond Wong, a veteran actor, director and producer. ``The 
problems didn't appear suddenly one day, so they're not going away 
in one day either.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong films flourished in the late 1980s, when the uncertain  
political climate in the territory gave filmmakers much creative 
fodder. 
</P>
<P>
	Cheng made it big with a series of comedies, portraying a  
strung-out former communist soldier who emigrated from mainland 
China to sophisticated Hong Kong. They were full of cliches and 
slapstick humor, but metaphors of the mainland's impending takeover 
of the then British colony loomed large. 
</P>
<P>
	By the early 1990s, money was flooding in from overseas  
investors, all wanting a slice of the lucrative market. The 
conventional wisdom was that if a movie was from Hong Kong and 
featured an A-list star like Cheng, it was sure to make money. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hong Kong movies were so popular investors needed to buy film  
'futures,''' says Manfred Wong, producer of ``A Man Called Hero.'' 
``They were so eager they paid you cash before you even had an idea 
to sell to them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That propelled the movie industry in a city with a population of  
just under 7 million into the world's No. 3 filmmaking spot, after 
India and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Hong Kong actors and directors perfected their skills  
during the boom before leaving for better money and bigger projects 
in Hollywood in recent years. Filmmakers also created a genre of 
adrenaline-pumping action, with movies like Chow's ``A Better 
Tomorrow'' and Chan's ``The Police Story'' becoming Western cult 
hits. 
</P>
<P>
	But success dragged down quality. Poor scripts and sloppy  
production became the norm in the rush to get movies into theaters. 
Blockbusters were the worst, with the demand of investors for 
expensive big stars leaving directors with little money for scripts 
and production work. 
</P>
<P>
	Cheng says many actors realized there were putting out poor  
films, but ``everyone was trying to make as much as they could 
while they were still hot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``In a way we are responsible (for the slump) because we've  
given the audience so much bad stuff. Obviously they're not going 
to come back,'' she says. 
</P>
<P>
	And they haven't.  
</P>
<P>
	``I always want to support local films, but there just really  
isn't much worth seeing,'' says Tammy Cheung, an independent 
filmmaker who teaches film studies at the Hong Kong Arts Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Poor quality aside, the film industry also has been hurt by  
worsening copyright piracy in Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	Pirated video CDs are available for as little as 64 cents -- with  
audience noise from theater in the background -- almost from the 
moment a movie is released on the big screen. 
</P>
<P>
	That seriously cuts receipts from selling video and TV rights,  
which normally contribute two-thirds of a movie's revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	Some critics say the Asian financial crisis has been good for  
the business. With investment money hard to come by, movie people 
are putting their best into projects that do get financed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Only the fittest survived,'' says Lau Wai-keung, who directed  
``A Man Called Hero,'' a high-tech extravaganza adopted from a 
popular comic. 
</P>
<P>
	Benny Chan, who directed Jackie Chan's ``Who Am I?,'' rounded up  
$25 million to make ``Gen-X Cops.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To keep within the budget, Chan hired three rookie actors to  
play the trio of police school dropouts chasing down international 
terrorists, but invested heavily on computer-generated effects. The 
film won critical acclaim and was one of the summer's biggest 
box-office hits. 
</P>
<P>
	``You want to give them a reason to go to your film instead of  
some standard Hollywood movie,'' Chan says. ``People don't just go 
see a film just because so-and-so is in it.''

<HEADLINE> NFL Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	With nine straight losing seasons, the St. Louis Rams have the  
longest streak of futility in the NFL. Now they have another 
distinction -- the league's only undefeated team. 
</P>
<P>
	Kurt Warner threw five touchdown passes, including four to Isaac  
Bruce, as the Rams beat San Francisco 42-20 on Sunday to break a 
17-game losing streak against the 49ers and improve to 4-0. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been waiting all my career to watch my quarterback take a  
knee to beat this team,'' said defensive tackle D'Marco Farr, a 
sixth-year Ram who had been 0-10 against the 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
	New England and Dallas got their first losses Sunday, leaving  
the Rams alone with a spotless record. It's been an amazing 
turnaround for a team that hasn't reached the playoffs since 1989 
and lost starting quarterback Trent Green with a preseason knee 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've finally caught up with the best team in our division,''  
said coach Dick Vermeil, who hugged owner Georgia Frontiere and 
blew kisses to the St. Louis crowd after Sunday's game. 
</P>
<P>
	Warner, a former Arena League quarterback, threw TD passes of  
13, 5, 45 and 42 yards to Bruce. He also found Jeff Robinson for a 
22-yard score. 
</P>
<P>
	Warner, who leads the NFL with 14 TD passes, completed 20 of 23  
passes for 323 yards. Bruce had five receptions for 134 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco quarterback Jeff Garcia, making his second  
straight start in place of ailing Steve Young, was 22-of-36 for 233 
yards but was intercepted on the 49ers' last three possessions. 
</P>
<P>
	In other NFL games, it was Atlanta 20, New Orleans 17; Chicago  
24, Minnesota 22; Cincinnati 18, Cleveland 17; Philadelphia 13, 
Dallas 10; Kansas City 16, New England 14; Buffalo 24, Pittsburgh 
21; San Diego 20, Detroit 10; Arizona 14, New York Giants 3; 
Tennessee 14, Baltimore 11; Denver 16, Oakland 13; and Miami 34, 
Indianapolis 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Tampa Bay played at Green Bay on Sunday night. The Monday night 	
matchup is Jacksonville at the New York Jets. 
</P>
<P>
                        *Eagles 13, Cowboys 10 	
</P>
<P>
	At Philadelphia, Doug Pederson threw a 28-yard TD pass to  
Charles Johnson as the Eagles (1-4) overcame a 10-point deficit 
against the Cowboys (3-1) in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas receiver Michael Irvin was taken off the field on a 	
stretcher in the first quarter after getting tackled and hitting 
his head on the artificial turf. Tests showed swelling in Irvin's 
spinal cord and a herniated disc, but he had movement in his hands 
and feet. 
</P>
<P>
                       *Chiefs 16, Patriots 14 	
</P>
<P>
	At Kansas City, Adam Vinatieri missed a 32-yard field goal  
attempt in the closing seconds that would have won the game for New 
England. The ball hit the right upright and bounced backward. 
</P>
<P>
	Drew Bledsoe's 27-yard completion to Shawn Jefferson set up the 	
field goal try by Vinatieri, who had already booted three 
game-winning field goals this season for the Patriots (4-1). Elvis 
Grbac engineered three second-half scoring drives for the Chiefs 
(3-2).	
</P>
<P>
                        *Bears 24, Vikings 22 	
</P>
<P>
	At Minneapolis, Chicago (3-2) forced five turnovers and turned  
three of them into touchdowns to beat Minnesota (2-3). 
</P>
<P>
	Vikings rookie tight end Jim Kleinsasser fumbled twice, and 	
Bears linebacker Sean Harris recovered one in the end zone for a 
touchdown. Barry Minter intercepted Randall Cunningham's tipped 
pass at the Bears 18 with three minutes left to preserve the 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
                        *Bengals 18, Browns 17 	
</P>
<P>
	At Cleveland, Akili Smith threw a 2-yard TD pass to Carl Pickens  
with 5 seconds left to lift Cincinnati (1-4) over the Browns (0-5). 
</P>
<P>
	In his first NFL start, Smith completed 25 of 41 passes for 221 	
yards and two touchdown with no interceptions. Cleveland rookie Tim 
Couch was 15-of-22 for 164 yards with one interception. 
</P>
<P>
                        *Bills 24, Steelers 21 	
</P>
<P>
	At Orchard Park, N.Y., Doug Flutie threw three TD passes and  
Eric Moulds had six catches for 122 yards and a score to lead 
Buffalo (4-1) over Pittsburgh (2-3). 
</P>
<P>
	Flutie completed 11 of his first 12 passes and finished 	
21-for-32 for 261 yards.	
</P>
<P>
                        *Chargers 20, Lions 10 	
</P>
<P>
	At Pontiac, Mich., Darryll Lewis returned a fumble 42 yards in  
the fourth quarter and San Diego (3-1) shut out Detroit (2-2) in 
the second half. 
</P>
<P>
	Lions coach Bobby Ross faced his old team for the first time 	
since being forced out by the Chargers three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
                        *Falcons 20, Saints 17 	
</P>
<P>
	Morten Andersen, who had missed four of six field-goal attempts  
going into the game, connected twice in the fourth quarter as 
Atlanta rallied to win its first game of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Andersen hit a 36-yarder to tie the game at 17 early in the 	
final period, then hit a 44-yarder with about six minutes left to 
give Atlanta (1-4) the lead for good. The defending NFC champions 
beat the Saints (1-3) for the ninth straight time. 
</P>
<P>
                       *Cardinals 14, Giants 3 	
</P>
<P>
	At Tempe, Ariz., Jake Plummer had his best game of the season as  
Arizona (2-3) snapped a three-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
	Plummer, who began the day as the NFL's lowest-rated starting 	
QB, completed 13 of 19 passes for 156 yards and a touchdown with no 
interceptions. He left the game early in the third quarter with a 
sore hip, but returned with 4:05 left. The Giants fell to 2-3. 
</P>
<P>
                        *Titans 14, Ravens 11 	
</P>
<P>
	At Nashville, Neil O'Donnell threw a 27-yard TD pass to Yancey  
Thigpen in the third quarter, and the Titans (4-1) overcame an NFL 
record for penalty yardage to beat Baltimore (2-3). 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee won its 10th straight AFC Central Division game 	
despite being penalized 15 times for 212 yards. The previous record 
was 209 yards by Cleveland against the Chicago Bears in 1951. 
</P>
<P>
                       *Broncos 16, Raiders 13 	
</P>
<P>
	At Oakland, the Denver Broncos won their first game in the  
post-John Elway era despite losing Pro Bowl tight end Shannon 
Sharpe with a broken collarbone. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Griese, the last-minute replacement for his own  
replacement, did a pretty decent Elway impersonation as the Broncos 
(1-4) blew a 13-point halftime lead before bouncing back to win. 
</P>
<P>
	Griese, benched earlier in the week but forced back into the 	
starting role by Bubby Brister's rib injury, threw for 234 yards 
and led the Broncos on an Elway-like drive at the end of the first 
half. The Raiders dropped to 2-3. 
</P>
<P>
                        *Dolphins 34, Colts 31 	
</P>
<P>
	At Indianapolis, Dan Marino passed for 393 yards and hit Oronde  
Gadsden on two big passes in the closing minutes as Miami (3-1) 
beat Indianapolis (2-2). 
</P>
<P>
	Marino, criticized by coach Jimmy Johnson after last Monday  
night's loss to Buffalo, threw the winning 2-yard TD pass to 
Gadsden with 27 seconds left. Marino got a second chance after his 
apparent fumble earlier in the drive was ruled an incomplete pass.

<HEADLINE> Unabomber Tells Magazine He is Sane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Unabomber Ted Kaczynski insists in an interview  
that he is not crazy, and says he would have preferred the death 
penalty to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm confident that I'm sane,'' he tells Time magazine in its  
Oct. 18 issue, on newsstands Monday. ``I don't get delusions and so 
forth. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had very serious problems with social adjustment in  
adolescence.... But it would have to be distinguished between an 
organic illness, like schizophrenia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The interview coincides with the imminent release of Kaczynski's

<HEADLINE>  Spartans, Coach Get Big Victory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- Don't worry about Nick Saban. The  
Michigan State coach will be fine, if he can ever stop smiling. 
</P>
<P>
	Saban has been hoping since coming to East Lansing in 1995 that  
the rivalry between the Spartans and mighty Michigan could be like 
the one in Florida between the Gators and Florida State. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, he got his wish.  
</P>
<P>
	He got a big victory, too. Easily the biggest of his career.  
</P>
<P>
	Bill Burke passed for a school-record 400 yards and two  
touchdowns, and Plaxico Burress caught 10 passes for a 
school-record 255 yards and a score as the Spartans held off the 
Wolverines 34-31 in a showdown of Big Ten unbeatens. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the best feeling I've ever had, and the happiest I've  
ever seen our team,'' Saban said. ``It is just too bad that either 
side had to lose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The win left Michigan State, which began the season unranked,  
6-0 overall and 3-0 in the conference. The Wolverines, hoping for a 
second national title in three years, slipped to 5-1, 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
	The outcome sent Michigan State from No. 11 to No. 5 in the  
rankings. Michigan dropped from No. 3 to No. 10. 
</P>
<P>
	``This team was as confident as I have ever seen them, but they  
didn't get caught up in the hoopla,'' Saban said. ``I'm very proud 
of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The trick now will be to keep his players on track. The Spartans  
are at Purdue this week, at Wisconsin the following week, then at 
home against Ohio State. If he can guide this team unbeaten through 
that stretch, Saban might be a lock for coach of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the way Burke and Burress are progressing, anything is  
possible. 
</P>
<P>
	Burke completed 21 of 36 passes and became the first player to  
pass for 400 yards for Michigan State, breaking the mark of 369 by 
Ed Smith against Indiana in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had games where I felt better, but I just wanted to keep  
plugging away,'' Burke said. ``I just didn't want to do anything 
that could lose the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Burress, who broke the school mark of 252 receiving yards by  
Andre Rison in the 1989 Gator Bowl against Georgia, wasn't about to 
let that happen. 
</P>
<P>
	``My motto is `Stay Dangerous.' I've got a new attitude,''  
Burress said. ``If I drop a pass, I just tell myself that the 
defense has to respect me, because they know I'll catch the next 
one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Spartans also won the battle of the trenches.  
</P>
<P>
	Michigan State, which had not allowed a rushing touchdown, went  
into the game allowing an average of just 42.8 yards a game on the 
ground. The Wolverines learned why, finishing with just six yards 
on 21 rushing attempts. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan, which has a bye this week, got school-record 396 of  
its 402 yards through the air, most of it on the arm of Tom Brady 
during a furious fourth-quarter comeback that came up short. The 
Spartans had 90 yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this isn't the most disappointing loss, it's right up  
there,'' Michigan nose guard Rob Renes said. ``I have to live with 
this the rest of my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Drew Henson, who played the second and third quarters for  
Michigan, completed 6 of 12 passes for 111 yards, including an 
81-yard TD bomb to Marcus Knight. But he also was picked off by 
Aric Morris, setting up the touchdown that put Michigan State ahead 
27-10. 
</P>
<P>
	Brady did his best to bring the Wolverines back with three  
touchdowns in the fourth quarter, but he just ran out of time. 
</P>
<P>
	``We set our goals high,'' Brady said. ``We just ran into a very  
good Michigan State team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This is the first time the Spartans have been 6-0 since 1966.  
They finished that year 9-0-1 after the 10-10 tie with Notre Dame 
in the final game of the season. Those Spartans also won the Big 
Ten championship and the national championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Saban would settle for that in a heartbeat.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Library Fund Raises $3M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The private foundation raising money for  
President Clinton's library in Arkansas took in about $3 million in 
1998, when he faced the impeachment crisis, a published report said 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The foundation's first tax return gives no information on the  
source of the money, and as a private, nonprofit group, it does not 
have to, Newsweek magazine reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton often schedules private meetings with potential donors  
to raise money for the project, which is expected to cost about 
$100 million. The library will be paid for and endowed by private 
donations but operated by the National Archives. 
</P>
<P>
	The meetings are listed on the president's official schedule as  
``private events.'' Newsweek said that on June 28, Clinton asked 
for donations from a group of fashion executives at a French 
restaurant in New York City, for example. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton aides say the meetings are not considered fund-raisers  
because those who attend are not required to buy tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	The library -- which will include a museum and a public policy  
center -- will be built along the banks of the Arkansas River in 
Little Rock, Ark.

<HEADLINE> Dogs Survive Being Buried by Quake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Lucky the dog lived up to its name.  
</P>
<P>
	Buried for 18 days by Taiwan's earthquake, Lucky and companion  
Paopao, which means ``treasure,'' emerged, wagging their tails, 
from the rubble of their owner's home in devastated Tsaotun town in 
central Taiwan, a newspaper reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The two canines apparently survived the collapse of the bottom  
floor of the house because the large wooden chair they were 
sleeping under blocked falling debris, the China Times said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dogs, rescued Saturday, ate the fish stored in a  
refrigerator smashed open by rubble and drank water from a nearby 
fish tank, the paper said. 
</P>
<P>
	The family of schoolmaster Lin Yen-chen, whose six members all  
survived the quake, had written the pets off as dead. 
</P>
<P>
	But barking was heard as a backhoe was clearing the site,  
causing the family to begin clearing rubble with their bare hands. 
</P>
<P>
	A medical check found both animals dehydrated, but in need only  
of rest and minor medication, the paper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Taiwan's Sept. 21 earthquake, which measured 7.6 in magnitude,  
was its worst in decades, killing more than 2,200 people and 
collapsing thousands of houses.

<HEADLINE> Dwight Patterson Dies at 87 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MESA, Ariz. (AP) -- Dwight W. Patterson, who was responsible for  
bringing the Chicago Cubs spring training camp to the Phoenix area, 
has died. He was 87 
</P>
<P>
	The rancher and Mesa civic leader died Friday in Mesa, the  
Tribune reported Sunday. No cause of death was given. 
</P>
<P>
	Patterson served on the city's junior chamber of commerce and  
became the first ``chief'' of the HoHoKams service organization, 
which guaranteed the Cubs $22,000 if they came to Mesa for spring 
training in 1951, then arranged for the Cubs to play at Rendezvous 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
	With the exception of one spring in California and a handful in  
Scottsdale, the Cubs have trained in Mesa ever since. The team 
attracted 176,000 fans to their camp last spring. 
</P>
<P>
	In honor of Patterson's efforts to bring spring training to  
Mesa, the baseball field at HoHoKam Park was named after him. He 
was honored yet again on Tuesday, when he threw out the first pitch 
for the opening game of the Arizona Diamondbacks' playoff series at 
Bank One Ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
	Patterson is survived by his wife and a daughter. Services will  
be held Thursday at First United Methodist in Mesa.

<HEADLINE> Indians in a Bind With Burba Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Not long after Dave Burba's right forearm  
tightened in Game 3, so did the division series between the Indians 
and Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	Burba, who was pitching a shutout through four innings, was  
forced to leave because of an injury that had been bothering him 
for nearly two weeks. Boston then pounded Cleveland's bullpen in a 
9-3 win to force a Game 4. 
</P>
<P>
	Burba's setback was just the latest in an injury-filled season  
for the Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	And, if they are able to advance to the AL championship series  
against the New York Yankees, Burba's injury could be the costliest 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't, `Here we go again,' '' Indians left fielder Richie  
Sexson said Sunday. ``It was more like, `What are we going to do 
with our starting pitching?' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Yeah. What are the Indians going to do?  
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland manager Mike Hargrove said Burba will have an MRI in  
Cleveland on Monday to determine the extent of his injury. The 
right-hander has been experiencing tightness on the underside of 
his right forearm, which tightened when he threw a split-finger 
fastball in the fourth inning. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think it's muscular,'' Hargrove said. ``Right now, we don't  
know anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the Indians are able to get past the Red Sox, and if Burba is  
unable to pitch against the Yankees, then Cleveland would have to 
reshuffle its postseason roster to add a starting pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the candidates Hargrove could choose from are left-handers  
Mark Langston and Chris Haney as well as former-Yankee Dwight 
Gooden, who was pulled from two starts against his former team 
during the regular season. All three were left off the 25-man 
roster for the division series. 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove, who would have to use Charles Nagy in a Game 5 against  
the Red Sox, said another option would be to use a three-man 
rotation against the Yankees. He also could start Jaret Wright, who 
took the loss in Game 3 after relieving Burba. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure there will be a readjustment on our roster if we make  
it to the next round,'' he said. ``But let's try to make it to the 
next round first.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Game 4 on Saturday night, Hargrove started ace Bartolo Colon  
on three days' rest for the first time this season. If he has to 
use Charles Nagy in a Game 5, and with Burba's status uncertain, 
Hargrove would have to go with Wright, Haney, Langston or Gooden 
against the Yankees in Game 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's certainly not the ideal path,'' Hargrove said.  
</P>
<P>
	Injuries are nothing new to the Indians, who used the disabled  
list 22 times with 16 different players and lost 924 man days to 
injury this season. However, Hargrove said the team wasn't looking 
for any sympathy and wouldn't use injuries as an excuse. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had to battle adversity this year,'' Hargrove said,  
``and we've stayed pretty close to being true to ourselves. If 
that's the way it goes, then that's the way it goes.''

<HEADLINE> White House Hopefuls Lobby for Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *Associated Press Writer-    	
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The urgent calls to United Food and  
Commercial Workers President Doug Dority came back-to-back -- Vice 
President Al Gore on Friday, Bill Bradley on Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The candidates' personal appeals were, other union officials  
said, pretty typical of the last-minute lobbying over the AFL-CIO 
endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
	Dority's reply to each was just as typical of the dynamic at  
work on the eve of the 13-million-member labor federation's 
biennial convention: I will support Al Gore, but ... 
</P>
<P>
	``Doug is leaning towards the view that an endorsement a couple  
of months from now may be the most impactful way to proceed,'' said 
Greg Denier, Dority's senior assistant. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a matter of practical, political consideration that there  
has to be some consensus building and on the question of early 
endorsement, obviously there's not consensus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the issue seemed settled to AFL-CIO President John Sweeney,  
who said Sunday he expected the labor federation to back Gore. 
``The delegates to the convention are moving toward an 
endorsement,'' Sweeney said on ABC's ``This Week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, interviews with several labor operatives suggest  
agreement that Gore waited too long to place his calls to key labor 
leaders and seal their support for an early nod. In the meantime, 
Bradley and his top operatives -- campaign manager Gina Glantz and 
strategist Will Robinson, both with their own long, professional 
ties to organized labor -- aggressively worked the phones. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley's message -- ``All I'm asking is that you give me some  
time'' before going with Gore -- began to stick, especially among 
labor leaders committed to letting the decision come from members 
not yet focused on the 2000 election. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that Bradley is closing in on -- or edging ahead of -- Gore in  
the key states of New Hampshire and New York, Gore allies fear 
another delay in the AFL-CIO endorsement that they have sought 
since February would be too big a blow to his already flagging 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Gore wouldn't get it, I think it would be very, very  
harmful to Gore,'' acknowledged Gerald McEntee, president of the 
American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, and 
Gore's chief backer at the convention. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bill Bradley and his folks have worked very hard. If there is  
an endorsement, Bradley is hurt, but not as much,'' McEntee said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sept. 27, both campaigns made separate presentations to the  
AFL-CIO's executive council, the 15 to 20 presidents of the largest 
affiliated unions, in a suite at the Hay-Adams Hotel across from 
the White House. Both camps showed slides of their polling data, 
fund raising, organizational structure and strategies for winning 
both the Democratic nomination as well as the general election. 
</P>
<P>
	One Gore ally present for both sessions, speaking on condition  
of anonymity, called Bradley's presentation ``surprisingly 
credible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Gore's problem, if you were to ask him and he were to be  
honest with you, is that the campaign underestimated how hard this 
(endorsement) would be and sort of took it for granted,'' Teamsters 
political director Michael Mathis said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the week or so leading up to the convention, not only did  
Gore hit the phones, but campaign chairman Tony Coelho enlisted the 
top Democrat in the House, Richard Gephardt of Missouri -- about as 
pure a labor hero as the Democrats have -- to make some calls, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the huge chore of moving Gore's campaign from Washington  
to Tennessee in the space of one week, Coelho and campaign manager 
Donna Brazile flew to the convention in hopes of solidifying 
support. 
</P>
<P>
	Sweeney was pressing Gore's case Sunday in a round of one-on-one  
meetings with reluctant union presidents. Bradley aides closely 
monitored the backroom wrangling from his New Jersey headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerry Shea, governmental affairs assistant to Sweeney, said Gore  
has gotten a bum rap and, given how hard he has worked -- in the 
White House and in Congress before then -- to advance labor 
interests, should not have been expected to work so hard for an 
endorsement that many view as inevitable still. 
</P>
<P>
	``The union presidents wanted to be asked, every president  
wanted to be called,'' said Shea. ``People were holding him to a 
higher standard.''
