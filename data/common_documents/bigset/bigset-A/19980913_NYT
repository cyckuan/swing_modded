<P>
   CLINTON-TEXT (Washington) _ Complete text of a response by
President Clinton's lawyers to the report submitted by Kenneth
Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel, to the House of
Representatives. The references to ``narrative at'' a given number
are to specific points in Starr's report.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-SCHOLARS (Washington) _ Experts on constitutional law
said Saturday that some of the scathing allegations in report by
the Whitewater independent counsel Kenneth Starr could
appropriately be defined as impeachable offenses within the meaning
of the Constitution. But in interviews after they had read the
report, several of them said that because impeachment is defined as
a political process by the Constitution, the question of whether
Clinton's actions merited removal from office depends not on legal
analysis but on the public reaction to the details of 445-page
report. By William Glaberson.
</P>
<P>
   (Subbed with 1STLD)
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-STRATEGY (Washington) _ President Clinton's closest
advisers waited nervously Saturday to see if the most audacious
political gamble of his career _declaring last month that he told
the truth when he swore he did not have a sexual relationship with
Monica Lewinsky _ would cause the public to turn on his inquisitors
rather than on him.
</P>
<P>
   (Subbed with 1STLD)
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-ASSESS (Washington) _ As President Clinton starts down a
fateful road with many forks, he will want to walk as slowly as he
can. It would be surprising if he made definitive decisions
quickly. Public opinion coalesces only slowly, and public opinion
will ultimately prove sovereign. It will guide Congress in its
deliberations, as well as the president, but its shape may not be
completely clear for a week or more. By R.W. Apple Jr.
</P>
<P>
   (Subbed with 1STLD)
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-RDP (Washington) _ The White House prepared a second
wave of rebuttal Saturday to defend President Clinton from the
threat of impeachment, pressing to regain the initiative as House
members made critical soundings of how the scathing charges of
illicit sex and abuse of office were being received by America at
large. By Francis X. Clines.
</P>
<P>
   (Subbed with 1STLD)
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-STARR (Washington) _ Kenneth Starr, a deeply religious
man, whose father, a fundamentalist minister, used to deliver
sermons back home in Texas on the perils of women dressed in
bermuda shorts, has sent an impeachment report to Congress chock
full of explicit sex. And Wanda Cates of Crowell, Texas, is not
surprised. By Michael Winerip.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-REPUBS (Washington) _ Political memo. In a partisan
call-to-arms last April, Speaker Newt Gingrich vowed to lead a
drumbeat of attacks about scandal at the White House. So after
Kenneth Starr's report reached the House on Thursday, it marked
quite a transformation when Gingrich sternly lectured members about
decorum. That reticence, and that of several other party leaders,
reflects a carefully drawn strategy to say nothing that could
tarnish an image of impartiality, at least until the elections. By
Richard L. Berke.
</P>
<P>
   (Subbed with 2NDLD)
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-DAY (Washington) _ The president's day, with expected
additional rebuttal. By James Bennet.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-HILLARY (Washington) _ A look at Hillary Clinton in the
wake of the report's release. By Melinda Henneberger.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-INSIDERS (Washington) _ The people around Clinton who
knew of his escapades: Betty Currie, Harold Ickes, formerly of his
staff, and Lou Fox of Secret Service. By David E. Sanger.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-COMPARE (Washington) _ Comparing Starr's report and
Clinton's rebuttal. By David E. Rosenbaum.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-BLACKS (Washington) _ Unwavering support for Clinton
among members of the Congressional Black Caucus. By Eric Schmitt.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-HYDE (Washington) _ On Henry J. Hyde's ``power wall'' in
his Capitol Hill office are photographs of him with Dwight D.
Eisenhower, Richard M. Nixon, Gerald R. Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald
Reagan, George Bush, Mother Theresa, the Pope _ and Bill Clinton.
``To Mr. Hyde _ with respect,'' Clinton signed the photo taken
during their first encounter in 1993, just before he made his first
address to Congress as President. Nobody, it seems, doesn't respect
Henry Hyde. By Elaine Sciolino.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-CONYERS (Washington) _ A look at John Conyers, the
ranking Democrat on Judiciary Committee. By B. Drummond Ayres Jr.
</P>

the report. By Felicity Barringer.

library. By Kevin Sack.

Clinton dominated news reports in Europe on Friday night and
Saturday. By Craig R. Whitney.

</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-REACT _ Voices from across the country. By Mireya
Navarro.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-NY-POLS (New ork) _ New York-area politicians' comments
on Clinton are guarded. Speaking off the record, some of the
candidates and their aides expressed mounting frustration that, at
a time when they would like all eyes on their races, they were
being swamped by the news from Washington. By Richard Perez-Pena.
</P>
<P>
   And see related (filed in `k' category):
</P>
<P>
   DOWD-COLUMN (Washington) _ COMMENTARY: PULP NONFICTION. (The
president must not lose his job. Not over this. Certainly, Bill
Clinton should be deeply ashamed of himself. He has given a bad
name to adultery and lying. He has made wickedness seem pathetic,
and that's truly a sin. Kenneth Starr, all these years and all
these millions later, has not delivered impeachable offenses. He
has delivered a 445-page Harold Robbins novel.) By Maureen Dowd.
</P>
<P>
   HERBERT-COLUMN (Undated) _ COMMENTARY: STILL DOESN'T GET IT.
(There is nothing new in Kenneth Starr's report, just confirmation
in extreme and at times lurid detail of the type of person Clinton
has always been. The president is not sorry. He's apologizing
because there's a gun at his head. He's not changing what he now
describes as his sinful ways. He's trying to manipulate public
opinion so he can survive to sin again. The psychodrama remains as
long as he remains.) By Bob Herbert.

CLARK INJURED IN RANGERS' 8-2 VICTORY AGAINST DEVIL RAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ The Rangers gained ground on the American
League West-leading Anaheim Angels, but ground might be an
essential that their first baseman no longer can cover at a time
when it matters most.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers moved within one game of the Angels with last
night's 8-2 victory against the expansion Devil Rays at Tropicana
Field. First baseman Will Clark, however, sustained an injury that
leaves his availability in question and jeopardizes a contending
team's prospects with 15 games remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be anything from a couple of days,'' Rangers manager
Johnny Oates said, ``to the rest of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark fractured the big toe on his right foot after being hit
with a third-inning slider thrown by former Rangers right-hander
Julio Santana. Clark remained in the game after being hit by the
pitch, but he departed during the fourth inning for X-rays.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be the ultimate day-to-day, but I'm going to
strap it on one way or another,'' Clark said. ``I will be
available.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark's injury served as the proverbial dark cloud on an
otherwise shining evening.
</P>
<P>
   Reserve outfielder/first baseman Mike Simms _ who replaced Clark
in the lineup _ and catcher Ivan Rodriguez hit consecutive home
runs in a span of six pitches during the Rangers' three-run fifth
inning, and right-hander Rick Helling (19-7) battled through eight
innings and joined Yankees right-hander David Cone as the league's
19-game winners.
</P>
<P>
   Simms, who entered the game mired in a 1-for-31 slump, gave the
Rangers their second lead with his two-out, two-run homer off
Santana (5-4). Rodriguez followed suit with a solo home run that
gave the Rangers a 4-1 advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The opposite-field home run ``tells me I'm getting close,'' said
Simms, who snapped a streak of 29 hitless at-bats with his
sixth-inning double Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's important right now,'' said Oates, who indicated that
designated hitter Lee Stevens and Simms will form a platoon at
first base should Clark not be able to play.
</P>
<P>
   Clark can play as pain allows, but it remains to be seen how the
fracture will affect his playing time and ability to hit. Clark
strides toward the mound with his injured right foot, but the left
foot remains more instrumental in his swing. A left-handed batter
supports his weight and rotates his hips through his left foot.
</P>
<P>
   The reduction of swelling and pain in the toe remains Clark's
chief priorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see how good modern medicine is,'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   Helling surrendered two runs on eight hits and issued three
walks, but the right-hander escaped second-inning trouble and
minimized the damage during the Devil Rays' one-run third and fifth
innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't nearly as sharp as I have been the past four or five
starts, but I battled through the first five innings,'' Helling
said. ``It wasn't easy those first five innings, but I was able to
make the pitches when I needed it most.''
</P>
<P>
   Second baseman Mark McLemore ensured the Rangers' victory with
his two-run, sixth-inning double against right-hander Esteban Yan,
and third baseman Todd Zeile later provided another two-run double
during the Rangers' final at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers learned of the Angels' 3-2 loss to the Orioles in
Baltimore before last night's first pitch and took advantage of
their opportunity to gain ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're one game closer to them than we were today,'' Oates
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, though, might be one first baseman shy, too.

D-BACKS VICTIMIZE DAAL AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ Pitchers like to be appreciated by their manager
and teammates, but they like a more tangible form of support even
more. Omar Daal is getting plenty of the former, very little of the
latter.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks left-hander was terrific against the Cincinnati
Reds on Saturday, giving up an unearned run and four hits in seven
innings. But again, Daal had nothing to show for it except a
diminished ERA and lots of kind words after the Reds' 3-0 victory
at Cinergy Field. Bret Boone drove in all the runs as the
Diamondbacks lost their fourth straight and sixth in seven games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Omar was outstanding again,'' Manager Buck Showalter said.
``I've sat here quite a few times and said the same thing. He
deserved a better fate.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop-turned-second baseman Jay Bell said, ``Omar pitched
wonderfully. When a pitcher gives you a chance to win, you've got
to take advantage of that. We didn't take advantage of a tremendous
outing like we should have.''
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Damian Miller, who had two of the Diamondbacks' three
hits, was only half-kidding when he said, ``We're pretty much
guaranteed zero or one run when Omar pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   Daal was coming off a bad start against Houston (four innings,
seven runs), but before that he had a 1.65 ERA over 54 innings. His
record during that stretch is 3-3. All three losses were shutouts,
2-0, 3-0 and 1-0. In his past six losses, the Diamondbacks have
scored four runs.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching with a sore throat because of tonsillitis, Daal lowered
his ERA to 2.78. But here's how his luck is running: He fell
one-third of an inning short of qualifying for listing among the
league leaders. Daal was lifted for pinch-hitter Brent Brede in the
eighth with two outs and Miller on first. And remember, this is the
guy who missed nearly three weeks after injuring his hamstring
running the bases.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks, who lost, 13-1, on Friday, still were in the
game at that point, trailing, 1-0. Brede walked, moving the tying
run to second base. But the next hitter, Andy Fox, grounded out
weakly to second.
</P>
<P>
   With Daal out of the game in the bottom of the inning, Boone's
single off Aaron Small scored a pair of runs after pinch-hitter
Sean Casey was intentionally walked to load the bases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it's a little bit frustrating,'' Daal said. ``In the
last month when I pitch, sometimes we don't get runs. But that's
the game. And the other pitchers? They've pitched very well. Parris
was incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be Reds right-hander Steve Parris, who worked 7
innings and retired 17 straight between Miller's leadoff double in
the third and Miller's single in the eighth. After Brede walked,
Gabe White came in to get Fox and finished up.
</P>
<P>
   Daal's only real mistake was walking Reggie Sanders to lead off
the Reds first. Chris Stynes then hit a double play ball to Bell,
but shortstop Tony Batista dropped the relay throw.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just missed it,'' said Batista, back at his old position as
part of the experiment of trying Bell at second. ``That's one error
for me. It was a good flip.''
</P>
<P>
   Dmitri Young then lofted a pop fly that fell among Bell, Batista
and deep-playing center fielder Devon White for a single. The
consensus was that it was a catchable ball. Catchable by whom
wasn't totally clear, although Bell took responsibility. With the
bases loaded and none out, Paul Konerko popped out, but Boone's
sacrifice fly to left was deep enough to score Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   That was plenty for the Reds. The Diamondbacks were ``anemic,''
in Showalter's word, against Parris and White.
</P>
<P>
   It was hot on the AstroTurf, a day game after a night game, but
Showalter expected more and carefully noted what he saw. Or didn't
see.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's one of those days when you can separate yourself
out,'' he said. ``A hot day and the standings are tough for you.
When I played, I looked at it as an opportunity to shine.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point, you've got to take the initiative, especially
at this time of year. First impressions and last impressions are
very important.'' &QL;

SMITH: WE CAN WIN WITHOUT TKA CHUK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. - As he waits and ponders his next move from
his home near Boston, Keith Tkachuk can't help but wonder what life
without him might be like for the Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   The star left wing will have plenty of time to think about it,
too, as he settles in for what figures to be a drawn-out and bitter
holdout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want it to come down to this. I wanted to be there
right from the start and not even have to think about that,'' said
Tkachuk, who was suspended by General Manager Bobby Smith on
Saturday for failing to report. Every day he sits will cost Tkachuk
more than $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they made a promise they couldn't keep, and that's why I'm
(in Boston) and not there,'' Tkachuk said.
</P>
<P>
   ``How is the team going to do without me? Why don't you ask
Bobby Smith? He's the one who said the Coyotes can make the
playoffs without me. Apparently, they'll do fine without Keith
Tkachuk. They don't need me.''
</P>
<P>
   Tkachuk was being sarcastic, but Smith wasn't when he said last
month the Coyotes can succeed without their best player. They'll
begin to find out for certain today, when veterans open daily,
on-ice workouts at the Cellular One Ice Den in Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keith's agent (Bob Murray) took real issue when I made that
statement, too, saying it's nothing but conjecture,'' Smith said.
``Well, I know it's conjecture, but I honestly believe we can make
the playoffs without Keith Tkachuk. I know we'd do better with him
in the lineup, but just look around at what we've got on this
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Is Smith right? Let's look: &QL; 
The defense rests
</P>
<P>
   Finally, it seems this franchise has shaken itself from the
image of never having a top-notch NHL defense. Of the top five
D-men they plan to roll out for the season opener Oct. 11 against
Ottawa, only Teppo Numminen and Gerald Diduck were with the Coyotes
at the start of last season.
</P>
<P>
   But they managed to re-sign All-Star Oleg Tverdovsky, traded for
U.S. Olympian Keith Carney (from Chicago) and then locked up
perhaps the best blue-liner on the free-agent market for the next
four years by landing Jyrki Lumme (from Vancouver).
</P>
<P>
   ``He's so good, you wouldn't believe it,'' said Coyotes center
Cliff Ronning, a teammate of Lumme's for in Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   Lumme is expected to team with Numminen on Phoenix's No. 1
defensive unit, which should be one of the strongest pairings in
the Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times, you never know how certain combinations are
going to work out,'' Coach Jim Schoenfeld said. ``Sometimes, what
you think makes perfect sense on paper doesn't always translate to
perfection on the ice. I don't know, but when I look at teaming
Teppo Numminen with a guy like Jyrki Lumme, I feel pretty safe it's
the right way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Carney and Tverdovsky should form the perfect one-two punch
behind the two Finns. Carney is a proven, stay-at-home defenseman
who looks after his own end, and Tverdovsky is a huge offensive
threat, having finished fourth in the league among defensemen in
scoring two seasons ago with 55 points as a 20-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   Diduck, a 14-year pro, brings stability to the third unit, where
he will be joined by any one of a handful of capable linemates. &QL; 
Center of attention &QL; 
Tkachuk was furious to see his good friend and favorite center,
Craig Janney, get dealt to Tampa Bay this summer. But by sheer
reduction _ including to the team payroll (Janney made $1.5
million) _ the Coyotes actually strengthened the center position.
</P>
<P>
   Janney's departure means fan favorite Jeremy Roenick can vault
to the No. 1 line, where he was so successful as a Chicago
Blackhawk for seven seasons. He's capable of cracking the 100-point
mark again but probably won't if he can't pass the puck to the
goal-happy Tkachuk, who has averaged 41 goals a year since 1993-94.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeremy had a great second half and a real good playoffs. He's
the kind of guy who builds on something like that,'' Schoenfeld
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ronning also seems poised for a rejuvenation. When his ice time
picked up, he took off, finishing 14th in the league with 44
assists, one more than Janney. Expect that total to climb with a
full season centering the likes of Greg Adams and Rick Tocchet, who
love to crash the net and camp outside the crease.
</P>
<P>
   Depth is no problem, either. The Coyotes have four
interchangeable skaters who will battle for the regular, final two
spots _ Bob Corkum, Daniel Briere, Juha Ylonen and Mike Stapleton.
Briere, 20, is an offensive machine, and the other three are among
the best penalty-killers on the squad. &QL; 
Left wing lock &QL; 
They might not have Tkachuk, but the Coyotes finally found a second
left wing who can step in and supply some offense. Adams, the
former standout from Northern Arizona University who spent the past
three seasons with the Dallas Stars, gives Phoenix instant
credibility at the position.
</P>
<P>
   If he can stay healthy, he's a 20- to 25-goal scorer. The
Coyotes haven't received more than 11 goals from any other left
wing besides Tkachuk since relocating from Winnipeg. Adams is 35,
but he should flourish here. He also might be asked to step up to
the top line alongside Roenick and right wing Dallas Drake and fill
Tkachuk's skates as long as the captain continues to sit. &QL; 
Leadership &QL; 
Tkachuk will tell you he still views himself as the leader of the
Coyotes _ whether some fans agree with him or not _ but there will
be no lack of leadership without him. Tocchet will see to that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not long after he got here, I think more guys were listening
to (Tocchet) than anybody, maybe even more than the coaches,'' one
player said. ``He helped keep the team together. He knows exactly
what buttons to push.''
</P>
<P>
   If Smith and Schoenfeld decide to strip Tkachuk of his
captaincy. Tocchet is the safe bet to wear the ``C.'' Numminen and
Roenick, assistant captains last season, are also possibilities. &QL; 
The puck stops here
</P>
<P>
   Assuming Nikolai Khabibulin is back to form after enduring a
couple of shaky slumps last season, there is little to worry about
in the goaltending department. He still posted 30 wins for the
second straight year and continues to be on the doorstep of moving
into NHL elite status.
</P>
<P>
   With veteran Jimmy Waite back for a full season, and improving
rookie Scott Langkow, the AHL's goalie of the year, Khabibulin will
get adequate rest and relief. Remember, he started 60 straight
games at one point, the second-longest streak in modern NHL
history. &QL; 
The verdict
</P>
<P>
   Are the Coyotes a better team without Keith Tkachuk? Yes and no.
</P>
<P>
   They'd be better with him. But after a busy summer of free
agency and trades, which also brought in J.F. Jomphe, Louie
DeBrusk, Mike Sullivan and Joe Dziedzic, and the expected
improvement within from Roenick, goalie Nikolai Khabibulin and
youngsters such as Brad Isbister and Shane Doan, they're better
than they were.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at what happened in Detroit during (Sergei) Fedorov's
holdout,'' Smith said. ``All the other guys stepped up and got the
job done. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be very disappointed if Keith Tkachuk isn't in our
lineup, but if you look at this objectively, we'll still have a
better team on opening night 1998 than we had in 1997. I don't see
how you can dispute that.'' &QL;

GOMEZ: MCGWIRE'S A LOCK, BUT HALL SHOULD GIVE MARIS 2ND LOOK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Not only did Mark McGwire almost single-handedly bring
baseball back this summer, he could wind up carrying Roger Maris
into the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire's assault on the single-season home run record returned
Maris' name to the forefront of the baseball world.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire probably has cemented his placement in the Hall of Fame,
especially considering he has hit more than 50 home runs in each of
the the past three years, a feat that never had been accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   But don't forget, it wasn't that long ago that McGwire was
anything but a lock for the hallowed Hall.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire missed most of two seasons because of foot ailments,
hitting a combined 18 home runs in 1993 and '94. Even after
back-to-back 50 home run seasons, McGwire easily could have slipped
back in the pack with another injury-filled season in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But after breaking the single-season home run record and
fattening his career total to 449, McGwire basically has secured
his placement in Cooperstown. A more amazing feat on McGwire's part
would be dragging Maris in with him.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime followers of the game believe more was written and
spoken about Maris over the past two weeks than when the reluctant
record breaker set the single-season standard with 61 home runs in
1961.
</P>
<P>
   The forgotten hero, one who fought personal and public demons
much of his career, actually may find himself boomeranging into
Cooperstown's hallowed halls, albeit posthumously.
</P>
<P>
   So what if he does so while holding onto McGwire's coattail? Is
there really any shame in that? Well, at least one member of the
veterans committee believes there is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should he be in now?'' one of the members who will control
Maris' fate said. ``He wasn't a Hall of Famer two years ago. What
makes him one now?''
</P>
<P>
   And so, the argument rages on.
</P>
<P>
   While Maris, who died of cancer in 1985, no longer is eligible
on the regular ballot (a qualified player remains on Hall of Fame
ballot a maximum of 15 years), he still can be elected through the
veterans committee, where a panel of 15 distinguished members act
as a safety net for players who may get overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   Maris' name already has come up with the veterans committee,
which failed to induct him in previous attempts. But with the
massive amount of attention toward Maris this season, maybe it's
time to try one more time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been hopeful all along,'' Roger Maris Jr. said. ``I
think with the wave of energy that has been pushed behind him and
his name this year, I think if he doesn't get in the Hall of Fame
this year, after all the attention drawn to his name and what he
did, then he is just not meant to be in the Hall of Fame.''
</P>
<P>
   The case for Maris is compelling but far from a slam dunk.
</P>
<P>
   Maris played from 1957 to 1968, hitting 275 home runs and
driving in 851 runs while batting .260 in 1,463 games for the
Cleveland Indians, Kansas City Athletics, New York Yankees and St.
Louis Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, his most famous 61 home runs came during the 1961
season, when he broke the record previously held by Babe Ruth. It
was such a bittersweet time for Maris that he never could enjoy
what took place.
</P>
<P>
   The love fest that engulfed McGwire the past two weeks was
non-existent for Maris. Ruth's widow, who attended the final game
of the '61 season at Yankee Stadium when Maris set the record,
never acknowledged him. Those who covered the story say she openly
rooted against Maris.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is pulling for Mark McGwire and they want to see him
do this, and I think that would be just an outstanding feeling for
my dad,'' Maris Jr., said. ``I wished that would have happened for
him.''
</P>
<P>
   While Maris' numbers might not stack up against the greatest
players in the Hall of Fame, they do measure up quite nicely
against some others who are enshrined.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 54 outfielders in the Hall of Fame, 36 have fewer career
home runs, including hitters such as Roberto Clemente, Goose
Goslin, Joe Medwick and Hack Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Another argument for placing Maris in the Hall is that he is the
only eligible player ever to win two Most Valuable Player awards
not inducted into Cooperstown.
</P>
<P>
   Almost lost when Maris hit his 61 home runs and in subsequent
years was his having won the American League MVP award the year
before, his first with the Yankees. Maris hit 39 home runs with 112
RBIs in 136 games for the Yankees in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   There is absolutely no clear-cut criteria for voting a player
into the Hall of Fame. Ballots are distributed to Baseball Writers
Association of America members who have covered baseball a minimum
of 10 consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
   To be eligible for induction, a player must have played at least
10 major league seasons. A BBWAA screening committee then places
all those players who warrant consideration on the annual ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Each voter is then left to choose his own criteria for
inclusion. A common requirement is for a player to have been the
best at his position for at least a five-year period.
</P>
<P>
   Maris comes awfully close using that requirement. He averaged 36
home runs from 1960 to '64. Despite playing in only 90 games in
1963, Maris averaged 95 RBIs during the same span.
</P>
<P>
   To be eligible for the veterans committee, a player must have
received at least 60 percent of the votes during one of his 15
eligible years on the regular ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Maris came close at least one of those years. It's
not like putting Maris into Cooperstown would be a stretch or put a
black eye on the integrity of the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   All things considered, Maris probably is straddling the fence
for inclusion into the Hall. However, taking into account what
Maris meant and did for the game, then any ties should go in his
favor.
</P>
<P>
   Let's hope the veterans committee sees it that way and at the
very least offers Maris' name up for consideration in January.
Inducting Maris into the Hall of Fame would not slight anyone
already there or those standing on the same fence as Maris.
</P>
<P>
   The veterans committee could make a wonderful gesture this
winter, one that would truly cap off a year filled with nothing but
celebration.
</P>
<P>
   What a sight it would be to see the Maris children accepting
Maris' spot in Cooperstown next summer. &QL;

WEEK HAS BEEN A BALL FOR NEW INDUCTEE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID CASSTEVENS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first one-on-one interview with home run ball No. 62, which
now resides at the Baseball Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   First, congratulations''.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, Sept. 8, 1998, you flew into baseball history
and became an instant celebrity. But you turned down every
interview'' request until now. Why?
</P>
<P>
   ``Doctor's orders. I sustained a concussion.''
</P>
<P>
   You look fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the swelling has gone down.''
</P>
<P>
   Any stitches?
</P>
<P>
   (Ball rolls eyes and smiles.)
</P>
<P>
   All of America was watching when Mark McGwire came to bat. What
do you remember after you left pitcher Steve Trachsel's hand?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not much. The neurologist says the details may come back to me
in time. But it could be weeks, months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just remember shutting my eyes and thinking, `You can kiss
THIS baby goodbye.' I must have passed out.''
</P>
<P>
   You didn't hear the bat crack?
</P>
<P>
   ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd roar?
</P>
<P>
   ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   Did you see the flashbulbs? It was magical.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen the replay. They said it was McGwire's shortest home
run of the season. It also had to be one of the ``fastest.'' Next
thing I remember, I was behind the wall and a ballpark employee had
me in his hand. I heard him say he was going to give the ball to
McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was happy. And relieved.''
</P>
<P>
   How's that?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, for one thing, I could have ended up in the bleachers
and had people diving and piling on me, fighting over me like I was
a fumble.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's demeaning, and dangerous. Every home run ball's worst
fear. Plus, I could have been taken hostage.''
</P>
<P>
   A fan demanding a ransom. . .
</P>
<P>
   ``Exactly.''
</P>
<P>
   That worried you?
</P>
<P>
   ``Look what happened to Patty Hearst.''
</P>
<P>
   But here you are.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still don't think it's sunk in. Pete Rose isn't in the Hall
of Fame and I am. A $9 baseball. It's unbelievable, really.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire talked about fate. Did you ever dream you might be the
ball he hit to break Roger Maris' record?
</P>
<P>
   ``I was aware of his home run pace. Everybody was. At the
Rawlings factory in Costa Rica I remember a ball _ we were packed
in the same box like eggs in a crate _ saying something like,
``Wouldn't it be great if we ended up in St. Louis in September.
One of us could become famous.'
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just kidding around, you know, joking the way people
do about winning the lottery.''
</P>
<P>
   Do you agree that McGwire's record-setting summer has revived
interest in baseball?
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely. It's all the country talks about. McGwire and
Sosa. Fans complain about salaries. McGwire gets $8 million, more
than the president makes. But Mac has had a better year.''
</P>
<P>
   We know about Mark McGwire. He is divorced. His 10-year-old son
is the Cardinals batboy. Tell me about yourself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a SWM. Cushioned cork center. 5\ ounces. I like outdoors,
movies, sports, travel, dining out, quiet evenings. Seek special
lady for friendship, possible long-term relationship. Guess there's
not much chance of that now.''
</P>
<P>
   Why not?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in here for life, man.''
</P>
<P>
   What's the Hall of Fame like?
</P>
<P>
   ``Musty.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, but what a place. It's the Smithsonian of baseball. The
story of our national pastime is told here. There's Babe Ruth's bat
from 1927. Ty Cobb's cleats. DiMaggio's locker.
</P>
<P>
   `` What's a typical day for you like''?
</P>
<P>
   Truthfully? It's so boring. Doors open at 9. They close at 5. I
sit in this glass case. People walk by. They say `Look . . .' or
`Wow!' Most just stare. I feel like a moon rock.''
</P>
<P>
   (Ball looks around, lowers his voice.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Mantle's bat and I are bustin' out at midnight a week from
Thursday. Keep it quiet.'' &QL;

TKACHUK SUSPENDED, TO BE FINED $10,181 DAILY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. - If  &UR; Keith Tkachuk plans to stick it to the
Coyotes by refusing to report to training camp, the Coyotes plan to
stick it him _ and his wallet.
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly what they did Saturday to the holdout left wing,
announcing that they have suspended Tkachuk and that he immediately
will begin losing a portion of his $2.8 million salary this season
every day he continues to sit out.
</P>
<P>
   After one day, it already has cost him $10,181 _ his average
daily salary based on the 275 days of the NHL season, including
training camp and the preseason.
</P>
<P>
   General Manager  &UR; Bobby Smith said rules in the NHL's collective
bargaining agreement allow teams to forfeit a day's pay from any
player with a contract who refuses to report to his team. He
notified Tkachuk's agent,  &UR; Bob Murray, of the team's decision by
fax Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Murray nor Tkachuk, the team's captain and leading
scorer each of the past three seasons, could be reached for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Tkachuk, 26, has two years left on his contract, but he is
demanding a multiyear extension that would pay him at least $8
million annually and make him one of the NHL's highest-paid
players.
</P>
<P>
   Although the suspension figures to be a significant financial
hit for Tkachuk, Smith wasn't prepared to speculate whether it
could convince Tkachuk to abruptly end his holdout, which
officially enters Day 2 today, when veterans skate for the first
time in Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' Smith said. ``I just know we're doing what the
rules say we do. We play by the rules, and this is one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   If Tkachuk sits out the entire preseason and then decides to
report for the season opener Oct. 11 against Ottawa, he will have
forfeited $295,272.72.
</P>
<P>
   Smith suspended Tkachuk last season on the eve of the Coyotes'
final preseason game for refusing to play in any exhibition games.
He reported to camp and worked out with the club every day, but
staged a boycott of the preseason games because he wanted his
contract restructured.
</P>
<P>
   Tkachuk didn't forfeit any money then because he had reported to
camp and was practicing.
</P>
<P>
   Smith rejected two last-ditch contract proposals from Murray on
Friday, calling them ``outlandish and offensive.''
</P>
<P>
   An NHL source close to both parties said the latest offers were
not less than the $40 million-plus package Murray and Tkachuk
originally presented in May. &QL;

MCGWIRE STILL DELIVERING AT GATE _ AND AS PERSON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Mark McGwire became the single-season home run record holder.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire and the St. Louis Cardinals watched more than 100,000
fans file into Cinergy Field for a two-game set between the
Cardinals and Reds. On Friday night it was more of the same as more
than 51,000 showed up at the Houston Astrodome, giving McGwire a
standing ovation when he came to the plate in the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way he felt in the middle of the game (Tuesday), he was so
exhausted he talked about scratching the day altogether,''
Cardinals Manager  &UR; Tony La Russa. ``I said, `Let's talk about it on
the plane and see how you feel (Wednesday).' He didn't sleep very
much.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he was aware that there was a big crowd (nearly 52,000),
and he thought he had the responsibility to do something. I want to
apologize to the fans, but they got two at-bats and I was proud of
Mark for making himself available, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The following is a sampling of some lesser-known facts about
McGwire's week:
</P>
<P>
   During a news conference at Cinergy Field the day after McGwire
hit the record-setting 62nd home run, Cincinnati rookie first
baseman  &UR; Sean Casey hid behind a curtain and photographed him.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of 51,969 showed up at Cinergy Field to see McGwire, who
was prepared to take a day off but decided to play half the game
upon learning of the size of the crowd, which was the largest
non-opening day crowd since the stadium opened in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   The Milwaukee Brewers were on a charter flight from Pittsburgh
to Houston when the pilot told the club over the cabin's speakers
of McGwire's historic home run. ``When we got to the hotel, I
stayed up all night watching (the coverage),'' Brewers Manager
 &UR; Phil
 &UR; Garner said.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire has hit 50 home runs against right-handed pitchers and
12 against lefties. He has hit 32 at Busch Stadium and 30 on the
road. Tuesday seems to be his favorite day, having hit 15 on that
day.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire hit home runs against 19 of the Cardinals' 20 opponents
this season. Detroit, which only played St. Louis twice, is the
only club not to give up a home run to McGwire this season.
</P>
<P>
   A clause in McGwire's contract kicked in during Tuesday's
memorable game, one in which he receives $1 for every ticket sold
over 2.8 million. So far, McGwire has earned $7,599. The Cardinals
are expected to draw somewhere around 3.2 million fans, which would
translate into about $400,000.
</P>
<P>
   In 189 games with St. Louis, McGwire has 86 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, McGwire has been the story of the 1998 season. Hands
down. &QL; 
A Mickey Mouse decision &QL; 
The Anaheim Angels finally acknowledged the deal they turned down
last year with Oakland, the one that could have landed the Angels
the game's current icon, McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   It's now known the Angels could have had McGwire and third
baseman
 &UR; Scott Brosius, who was an American League All-Star for the Yankees
this season, in exchange for center fielder  &UR; Jim Edmonds and third
baseman  &UR; Dave Hollins.
</P>
<P>
   Disney executives, however, decided to nix the deal, which
Oakland had agreed to complete. The biggest problem for the Disney
executives was their uneasiness with what it would take to sign
McGwire in the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, McGwire, who grew up in Los Angeles, would have
probably done anything to make a deal work with the Angels,
especially since his 10-year old son,  &UR; Matthew, lives in Orange
County.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; John McGwire, Mark's father, recently told  &UR; Ross Newhan of the
``Los Angeles Times'' that the Angels ``obviously missed the boat''
and that he was ``terribly disappointed with the Disney
organization'' for failing to recognize what McGwire would mean at
the gate and on the field for the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   The senior McGwire also was upset that the Angels passed on
McGwire, an All-American at Southern California at the time, in the
1984 draft after a scout ``sat in our living room and led us to
believe they were going to pick him.''
</P>
<P>
   Angels starter  &UR; Chuck Finley couldn't help but wonder what might
have been.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over here, there's no telling what he might have done,''
Finley said, ``with all the smaller yards and the protection in our
lineup. He might be pushing 80 right now.'' &QL; 
Eating at Raul &QL; 
 &UR; Raul Mondesi, who returned to his familiar spot in right field
recently after  &UR; Gary Sheffield's season ended because of a severely
sprained ankle, is talking like a man who wants to return
permanently to a position where he won two Gold Gloves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right field, that's my best position,'' Mondesi said. ``I
should be in right field to help my team. If the team wants to win
a lot of games, I can help do that in right field. When they asked
me to (switch positions), I wanted to help the team, you know? But
that's enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi played 94 games in center field after the Dodgers made
their blockbuster deal with Florida, acquiring Sheffield along with
three others for  &UR; Mike Piazza and  &UR; Todd Zeile. Still, Mondesi
leaves open the possibility of remaining in center field next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know, maybe I can do this (play center),'' Mondesi
said. ``Maybe I'll just stay there because my team needs me
there.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Tommy Lasorda, who turned over the duties of general manager to
 &UR; Kevin Malone on Friday, believes Mondesi is just being Mondesi.
</P>
<P>
   ``What?'' Lasorda said after hearing Mondesi's quotes. ``He
doesn't want to play center field? Well that's where we need him to
play. I've known Raul for a long time, and that's just talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Just another day in Dodgerland. &QL; 
THE HIT LIST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Gee, what a wonderful endorsement: Milwaukee's  &UR; Phil Garner,
who has managed the Brewers since 1992, suddenly has gone from
rock-solid to very iffy for next season. General Manager  &UR; Sal Bando
said, ``I think it's in the best interests of the club to wait
until after the season is over to re-evaluate everything.'' Ouch!
</P>
<P>
   &UR; C'mon, this is a joke, right?: Cleveland Manager
 &UR; Mike Hargrove had Toronto's  &UR; Jose Canseco intentionally walked in
the eighth inning during Monday's game. The catch? The Indians
trailed, 15-1, at the time.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Flashback (specially selected for you St. Louis
 &UR; fans): Tom Niedenfuer.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; What a very cool gesture: Seattle outfielder  &UR; Ken
 &UR; Griffey Jr. paid to fly a banner over Cincinnati's Cinergy Field on
Wednesday night when the St. Louis Cardinals were in town. It was a
salute to  &UR; Mark McGwire and his accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Trivia for the buffs: Five pitchers faced both
 &UR; McGwire and  &UR; Roger Maris in a regular season game, with none having
allowed a home run to both players. The five:  &UR; Tommy John,  &UR; Joe
Niekro,
 &UR; Phil Niekro,  &UR; Nolan Ryan and  &UR; Don Sutton. &QL; 
EXTRA BASES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Seattle's  &UR; Jay Buhner underwent ligament replacement (`` &UR; Tommy
 &UR; John'') surgery last week. The full recovery time is 6 to 8 months.
The Mariners are talking about possibly starting the season with
Buhner at first base and potential Gold Glove first baseman  &UR; David
 &UR; Segui in right field.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Hideo Nomo is 1-4 with an 8.29 ERA in his past six starts. The
New York Mets, who have used a six-man rotation the past few weeks,
have dropped Nomo into their bullpen. Allowing him to continue
starting could have hurt their playoff chances. Willie Blair, are
you ready?
</P>
<P>
   Former American League Rookie of the Year  &UR; Marty
 &UR; Cordova is falling out of favor with Minnesota Manager  &UR; Tom Kelly,
who benched Cordova for two games last weekend. Opposing managers
have started walking Todd Walker to get to Cordova, who has only 10
home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh's  &UR; Jason Kendall entered the weekend with 20 stolen
bases, five short of tying the National League record for stolen
bases by a catcher, set in 1978 by  &UR; John Stearns of the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia's  &UR; Marlon Anderson hit a home run in his first
major league appearance Tuesday. The last Phillies player to do so
was  &UR; Ed Sanicki, who accomplished the feat on Sept. 14, 1949, in a
game at Pittsburgh's Forbes Field.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago White Sox GM  &UR; Ron Schueler gave first-round draft choice
 &UR; Kip Wells until Monday to decide whether he wants to accept the
White Sox's $1.2 million signing bonus. Wells, a right-handed
pitcher from Baylor, is seeking $1.7 million. &QL; 
THE RUMOR MILL &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even though Pittsburgh's attendance will not match last season's
of 1,657,022, Pirates GM  &UR; Cam Bonifay expects his club's payroll to
jump from $13.4 million to around $22 million. The Pirates had a
payroll of $9 million last season. Expect a power hitter to be
added via free agency.
</P>
<P>
   Texas appears on the verge of dropping opening day starter  &UR; John
Burkett from the rotation. Rangers Manager  &UR; Johnny Oates has so
little faith in Burkett that he pulled him from Tuesday's game
against Kansas City after 4 innings. Burkett had not allowed a run
at that point.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco Giants officials are worried that  &UR; Kirk
 &UR; Rueter's pitching elbow is bothering him. Rueter insists nothing is
wrong, but the Giants will baby the left-hander the rest of the
season. Rueter was removed after five innings in his last start.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Kevin Malone took over as Los Angeles' GM on Friday afternoon.
The final boost for Malone may have come when  &UR; Dave
 &UR; Dombrowski, the Dodgers' top choice, gave a glowing recommendation
for Malone, who used to work with Dombrowski in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Just because  &UR; Dombrowski has agreed to return to Florida for the
next five years, courtesy of a $5 million contract that will make
him the highest-paid GM in the game, don't expect Manager  &UR; Jim
Leyland to follow suit. Leyland will have two weeks at season's end
to get out of the remaining three years of his contract.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Fred Claire, unceremoniously ousted as Dodgers GM this summer,
could be in line to take over as Kansas City Royals president. They
could do worse than hiring Claire, who put together a solid Dodgers
club before it imploded. &QL;

TEAM HITTING ROCK BOTTOM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ The Diamondbacks are hitting so poorly as a team
that they can manage only three hits against the Reds and not lower
their batting average.
</P>
<P>
   Batting .245 before losing, 3-0, at Cinergy Field on Saturday,
the Diamondbacks are still hitting .245. That's dead last in the
majors.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona has lost four straight. In their past three games, the
Diamondbacks have scored only three runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really been a thorn for us all year,'' Manager  &UR; Buck
 &UR; Showalter said of the lack of offense. ``Statistics don't lie.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's a statistic: Until  &UR; Brent Brede walked in the eighth
inning, the Diamondbacks had sent up 98 hitters dating to Tuesday
without drawing a base on balls. Reds starter  &UR; Steve Parris had a
four-pitch inning in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never anticipate walks being part of your attack, but they
should be,'' Showalter said. ``Everybody's trying to bridge the gap
between being aggressive and being selective. Obviously, they
haven't done too good of a job with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitting coach  &UR; Jim Presley said, ``When you only get three hits,
you'd better throw in some walks. Last week, we hit the ball really
well, but the past four or five days, we've struggled. . . . We've
got to swing at balls in the zone and we're not doing that right
now. When it goes bad, it goes.'' &QL; 
Going for it &QL; 
 &UR; Andy Benes, who starts for the Diamondbacks today, has a chance to
tie the record for pitching victories on an expansion team.
</P>
<P>
   Benes has 12 wins. The record is 13, held by  &UR; Gene Brabender of
the Seattle Pilots (1969),  &UR; Dave Lemanczyk of the Toronto Blue Jays
(1977) and Tampa Bay's  &UR; Rolando Arrojo, who will get a few more
starts this season.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Brian Anderson also has a shot. Anderson, who pitches Monday
against the San Francisco Giants, has 11 victories. &QL; 
Undecided &QL; 
Short of holding open tryouts, Showalter has an open mind about who
will pitch Wednesday against the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   It's  &UR; Clint Sodowsky's turn, but the right-hander has been
roughed up since joining the rotation Aug. 1. Sodowsky, the losing
pitcher in Friday's 13-1 loss to the Reds, has given up 18 earned
runs and 31 hits in 28 innings over six starts. He is 1-2 with
three no-decisions during that stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Showalter and pitching coach  &UR; Mark Connor have discussed using
relievers  &UR; Willie Banks, Alan Embree and rookie  &UR; Vladimir Nunez.
And Sodowsky remains a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've talked about everybody,'' Showalter said. &QL; 
Doing better &QL; 
The wife of Reds pitcher  &UR; Dennis Reyes has regained consciousness
and their premature newborn baby is healthy, the team reported.
</P>
<P>
   Because of complications and the condition of his wife,
 &UR; Clauvia, Reyes missed a start Thursday and returned home to
Higuera de Zaragoza in Mexico to be with his family. Reyes is
expected to rejoin the team Monday. &QL;

SAN CARLOS LAKE NEEDS HELP TO AVOID GOING DRY AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARRY BURKHART  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - San Carlos Lake on the San Carlos Apache Reservation
is in danger of drying up again.
</P>
<P>
   The lake is at 9 percent of capacity and falling rather rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   The lake has a history of going dry. But when it has water, it
may be the best fishing lake in the state. It also sustains
populations of eagles and other wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared it would go dry a year ago, but Congressman J.D.
Hayworth led a drive that included money from private interests to
purchase water from the Central Arizona Project. That water saved
the lake for another year.
</P>
<P>
   But it's in trouble again. How many times can it be saved?
Here's where it stands: Its prime feeder stream is the Gila River.
Above Safford, the river is running at 113 cubic feet per second.
But after irrigation water is pulled for agricultural purposes, the
flow into San Carlos is 32 cfs.
</P>
<P>
   Since most of the water in the lake is owned by water users
downstream, the current release from the lake is 460 cfs. That
means it's dropping at a steady rate, about 430 cfs.
</P>
<P>
   No one seems to be able to address the problems of this huge
recreational and wildlife resource.
</P>
<P>
   Water both above and below the lake is dedicated to irrigation.
The Apaches can't afford to buy back water. Private concerns and
governmental agencies can't continue to do it under current
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   If the lake is to reach any stability, it'll take governmental
action that will provide a constant flow of water.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't one of those easy problems to fix. &QL; 
Bad for hunters &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you haven't already read it, eight California men were cited
in the Yuma area for possession of 163 doves and are suspected of
shooting as many as 500.
</P>
<P>
   Seven plainclothes officers, four from the Arizona Game and Fish
Department and three from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,
observed the shooters killing doves and not attempting to retrieve
them.
</P>
<P>
   Doves are migratory birds and are subject to federal regulations
besides those of the state.
</P>
<P>
   One of the shooters had a sack of doves he intended to give
away, officers said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, officers used a dog to gather another 75 birds left
in the field. The remains of 50 more birds the men had killed the
day before also were recovered. The total number of birds found was
estimated at 200.
</P>
<P>
   More than 600 shotgun shell casings were recovered.
</P>
<P>
   The bag limit for doves is 10.
</P>
<P>
   Officers said that overall compliance to laws was good by
hunters in the Yuma area and that the eight California shooters
were not a sign of a larger problem.
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes and no.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona has been famous for its dove shoots. I say ``shoots''
instead of ``hunts'' because, unless a person has scouted the
territory for doves, that person knows where they are from past
experience and just goes to shoot. There is no hunt involved.
</P>
<P>
   Movie stars and other celebrities in addition to corporate
executives traditionally have come to Arizona to shoot doves.
</P>
<P>
   In the ``old days,'' shooters would take a limit of doves in the
morning, rest, then return to the field in the evening to shoot
another limit. We're not talking about common criminals here but
people who usually adhere to game laws.
</P>
<P>
   On my hunts this year, I have observed people shooting from
roads, which is illegal, and other offenses. They also left their
shell casings, which is littering. Most, I believe, are doing it
out of ignorance.
</P>
<P>
   But that's the problem with dove shooting in this state. In
other hunting sports, there truly is a hunt. It's a game. The
hunter surveys the territory, stalks the prey and tries to kill it.
</P>
<P>
   There are no apologies here. Hunting is both an ethically and
biologically sound outdoor pursuit _ unless it's abused.
</P>
<P>
   That's what bothers me. When shooting becomes an event instead
of a hunt, there's something wrong.
</P>
<P>
   I think most dove shooters are ethical and law-abiding. But when
shooters kill doves just to see them fall, there's something wrong.
</P>
<P>
   I hope the Californians are prosecuted strictly. &QL;

2 PLUS 2 EQUALS SCORE FOR WILDCATS' OFFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ It's a team with a lot of couples.
</P>
<P>
   Two and too.
</P>
<P>
   Call it Arizona math.
</P>
<P>
   Two quarterbacks in two games added up to two Arizona victories
Saturday with a 31-14 win at Stanford Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The whipping of Stanford 10 days after the season-opening win
over Hawaii are a couple of reasons to think that maybe, just
maybe, the Wildcats are better than expectations and
prognostications.
</P>
<P>
   But a couple of unknown factors have to be added to Arizona's
evolving equation.
</P>
<P>
   Too early?
</P>
<P>
   Too easy?
</P>
<P>
   Neither the NCAA Division I-A outpost at Hawaii nor the Pac-10
Conference's sadly-declining Cardinal resembles the projected
contenders that loom on Arizona's calender. So blame the schedule
maker. Or, if you're Arizona Coach Dick Tomey, put him on your
Christmas card list.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, Tomey's Wildcats are gaining momentum for the
midseason and confidence in the evident talents they'll need for
tougher tasks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're tickled to death,'' said Tomey, whose 1995 Wildcats
jumped out 2-0 only to lose four of their next five for a 6-5
finish. ``That was a hard-fought battle.''
</P>
<P>
   The battle in front of a tiny crowd on a warm day actually was
over early in the fourth quarter when Arizona quarterback Keith
Smith and receiver Dennis Northcutt noticed that the Cardinal had
just sent in an untested cornerback, freshman Brian Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Smith and Northcutt delivered a 33-yard lesson to Stanford's
first-year student. Northcutt displayed some brilliant foot work
along one side of the end zone for a touchdown and one of his five
receptions for 160 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The touchdown was decisive. The Cardinal, now 0-2 after a
season-opening loss to San Jose State, had just scored by going 75
yards in six plays within 1:48. The quick strike killed any notion
of a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't just sit back and run the ball,'' said Smith, who
started, struggled and returned with the key play after Ortege
Jenkins led the Wildcats to three touchdowns and Mark McDonald
field goals in the second and third quarters. ``We couldn't play
conservative. About 12 minutes were left. We still had to play the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't play baby football.''
</P>
<P>
   No babies allowed.
</P>
<P>
   That, at least, has been the mature approach taken by Smith and
Jenkins through two games. On this day, Jenkins was more effective
after starting and struggling at Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford, crippled in the opening quarter by the loss of
receiver Troy Walters to an ankle sprain, represented Smith's turn
to start and struggle. The Wildcats muffed three scoring
opportunities and found themselves trailing, 7-0, 19 minutes after
the opening kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Jenkins.
</P>
<P>
   He went 8 of 14 with 158 yards, including a 22-yard touchdown
strike to Jeremy McDaniel, whose moves along the sidelines and
through defenders would dazzle an skilled dance partner.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins also scrambled 20 yards for a key first down, tossed a
44-yarder to Northcutt and handed off to Kelvin Eafon for
touchdowns on runs of 10 and 4 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've just got two great quarterbacks,'' said Jenkins, whose
day was helped immeasurably by the return of running back Trung
Canidate, a former Central High star who rushed for 110 yards in
his first game since recovering from a stress fracture. ``I was
excited all week after I struggled at Hawaii. I wanted to compete
and help the team win. I didn't get the chance at Hawaii, because
Keith was so hot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't how you can keep me off the field. I don't how you can
keep Keith off the field. I'm glad I don't have to make the
decision. That's a tough one.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, it's also been a good one. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- Since independent counsel Kenneth Starr's report
on President Clinton was made public Friday, Washington has been
running full tilt.
</P>
<P>
   The descriptions of the president's sexual encounters with
Lewinsky _ broadcast on television and reprinted in major
newspapers across the country _ were truly the talk of the town
Saturday. Outside a downtown Starbucks, where tourists chatted as
they ordered their double lattes, a homeless man closely read a
tattered copy of the Washington Post's reprint of the Starr report.
</P>
<P>
   As the White House braced for reaction to the lurid descriptions
in Starr's report, leaders in the Democratic Party attempted to
pull their membership together.
</P>
<P>
   In an hourlong phone conversation Saturday, House Democratic
leaders talked about ways to overcome Starr's report and what to
expect as the Judiciary Committee ponders whether there is enough
evidence to warrant an impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The strategists included Majority Whip David Bonior of Michigan,
Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.), Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), Vic Fazio
(D-Calif.), Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) and Martin Frost (D-Texas).
</P>
<P>
   Their hope: The American people will see it as a report about
the president lying about a sexual affair to protect his family
from the hardship of discovering the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The report is disgusting,'' said John Lewis, who, like DeLauro
and Menendez, is one of the party's chief deputy whips. ``But this
is not a Watergate, it is not what Nixon did. To me, the president
had an affair with a girl and lied about it.''
</P>
<P>
   And as the Democrats conferred on the phone, work on the report
continued. In a plain, government-issue room of the Gerald R. Ford
Office Building, Republican and Democratic staffers from the House
Judiciary Committee labored into the night, poring over some 2,000
pages of supporting material sent by Starr to back up his
allegation that Clinton has committed impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure is building in both parties to make this next batch of
material public because it contains evidence Starr believes backs
up the 445-page report alleging that Clinton committed perjury and
then obstructed justice by concealing an adulterous affair with
Monica Lewinsky, a former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   Abbe Lowell,chief counsel to the Democrats on the Judiciary
Committee, and David Schippers, his Republican counterpart, started
reviewing files as soon as the sergeant-at-arms unsealed the boxes
Friday. Lowell stayed until midnight when one of the three
permanent guards stationed in front of the room asked him to leave.
</P>
<P>
   The guards are stationed to protect the 2,000 pages and 17 boxes
of evidence that have not been made public and to keep the media
from entering the building. Lowell and Schippers must approve any
slip of paper going into the room. No recording devices are
permitted and security codes must be punched in before anyone is
allowed in the room. There is also a motion detector inside, which
requires a special code to shut it off.
</P>
<P>
   These elaborate security precautions did little to stop TV crews
from lining up in front of the nondescript outpost on Capitol Hill.
They came as early as 8 a.m. to wait for a comment from a member of
the House Judiciary Committee, the panel charged with overseeing
any possible impeachment hearings, and the only group allowed to
enter the room other than the investigatory staffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This story has been going on for a long time; we are new meat
in a den of hungry animals,'' said Lowell, referring to the
mediaoutside as he walked back into the room.
</P>
<P>
   The documents could be made public as early as midweek, as
Democrats want to get the evidence out as quickly as possible. This
was a strategy used during last summer's hearings into whether the
Democratic National Committee and the White House violated campaign
fund-raising laws. The idea is to get the bad news out as quickly
as possible to lessen the long-term damage.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the Democratic National Committee adopted another
strategy, sending an analysis of Starr's report to decision-makers
throughout the country, including a chart with a headline asking:
``Where's Whitewater?'' The text pointed out that Starr's report
mentioned sex 548 times and Whitewater, the failed land deal Starr
was hired to investigate four years ago, only twice.
</P>
<P>
   As Lewis sees it, Starr's report fails to make a case for
impeachment, and Clinton has been punished enough by the pain his
behavior has caused his family and the public humiliation he has
been forced to endure.
</P>
<P>
   Other Democrats have not been as supportive. The real test will
come after the nation has had time to digest the massive Starr
report, which lists 11 grounds for the possible impeachment of
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde (R-Ill.), who has made
numerous assurances that any inquiry will be bipartisan, said
Saturday that he is unhappy with the ``salacious material.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one of the downsides, or fallouts, from this whole
process has been giving too much currency to salacious activities
and talk,'' Hyde said. ``I don't think that's helpful to the
country, but there's a tremendous demand for the whole story to be
put out on the table.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats on the panel fear politics will play a role in putting
that story on the table.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people deserve an analysis of Ken Starr's
evidence and a determination of the future course of Congress
(that) is fair and objective,'' said Jim Jordan, spokesperson for
the Democratic side.
</P>
<P>
   California Democratic Rep. Zoe Lofgren, a member of the
Judiciary panel, said she sees her job as applying the law to
facts. And the facts, she notes, do not rise to the level of facts
laid out in the Watergate impeachment inquiry of former President
Richard Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like the behavior; obviously, it's tawdry,'' Lofgren
said of Clinton. ``But the question is not how I feel about his
behavior, which is obviously immoral and wrong. The question for me
as a member of the Judiciary Committee is to use my head and apply
facts to law, and that's what I will do.''
</P>
<P>
   When she does apply facts to law, she is skeptical that, at this
point, the Starr report allegations rise to the level of
impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't really address the issue of the Constitution at
all, which I think is kind of shocking, and the one area where he
addresses it in a hasty fashion, it is legally deficient,'' said
Lofgren, a lawyer and former low-level Democratic aide during the
Watergate inquiry.

   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ Thirteen seasons as a professional
baseball player advised Rangers designated hitter Lee Stevens of
what to expect.
</P>
<P>
   Major-league pitchers often don't surrender consecutive home
runs within a span of six pitches and not send a message to the
next batter who steps to the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Devil Rays right-hander Julio Santana, a former Rangers player
and Stevens teammate, delivered his message with a first-pitch,
head-high fastball.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had some good swings against him, and he tried to throw
the ball up and in,'' Devil Rays manager Larry Rothschild said.
``He didn't hit him, and he didn't try to hit him.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, who came to the plate after consecutive third-inning
home runs by first baseman Mike Simms and catcher Ivan Rodriguez,
displayed no emotion after the pitch sailed past his head and to
the screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could have hit me if he wanted,'' Stevens said. ``He throws
95 mph.''
</P>
<P>
   Plate umpire Larry McCoy intervened immediately and issued a
warning to both benches.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me he didn't want anything to get started, and that's
why he warned Santana,'' Rothschild said.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens understood why Santana responded in the manner he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was just something he felt had to be done,''
Stevens said. ``He didn't let it go. He didn't throw it as hard as
he could have.''
</P>
<P>
   Rangers right-hander Rick Helling planned to deliver a similar
message to a player in the Devil Rays' lineup, but several in the
visitors' dugout urged their starting pitcher not to retaliate and
risk being ejected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't care less if I go four innings and we win the
game,'' Helling said. ``The guys know that I'm going to do whatever
it takes to protect our hitters.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens no doubt appreciated Helling's sentiments, but he
downplayed the incident and the situation never escalated.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things happen,'' Stevens said.

PICKING UP THE TAB  
 ALLEN'S DEEP POCKETS HOLD KEY TO SEATTLE HOPES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE Let's see. . . What has Paul Allen bought lately?
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, it's been a few more companies, a ton of land
in and around Seattle, an election and another pro sports
franchise.
</P>
<P>
   But this is a new week, and this fun-loving multibillionaire
techno-wizard knows no bounds. If he can think it, he can do it.
And he has.
</P>
<P>
   Allen, who founded Microsoft with high school buddy Bill Gates,
is the nation's third-wealthiest person. Only Gates, at $48
billion, and investor Warren Buffett, at $33 billion, rank ahead of
Allen and his $21 billion net worth, according to ``Forbes''
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   So, coughing up $6 million for lobbying, public relations and
campaign ads and picking up the tab for the June 1997 special
election in which the people of Washington narrowly agreed to pitch
in $300 million to help him build a new $425 million football
stadium and exhibition center in downtown Seattle was pocket change
to Allen.
</P>
<P>
   He told the people of the state that if they helped pay for the
complex, he would buy the NFL's Seattle Seahawks for $200 million
and keep them in the Emerald City. They did, and he has.
</P>
<P>
   Not only are the Seahawks staying, but Allen has begun building
them into something special, as swiftly and proactively as he did
with his personal empire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a salary cap in place in the NFL to keep someone from
just buying players,'' said Cardinals Coach Vince Tobin, whose team
visits Allen's Seahawks this afternoon at 1. ``There are parameters
that we all are required to operate within. But at the same time,
there are things that the wealthiest owners can do with signing
bonuses that has diluted the purpose of the cap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure even the wealthiest owner can go out and buy a
Super Bowl winner, but but there are ways he can make his team much
more competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen has figured that out.
</P>
<P>
   With huge signing bonuses, Allen has landed free agents and
reached quick agreement with high draft picks. He also has rewarded
those already on the roster with extensions or renegotiations that
include whopping bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   The most striking example to Cardinals fans was Allen's victory
in the Ricky Watters sweepstakes in March. Watters, a Pro Bowl
running back whose contract had expired at Philadelphia, visited
the Cardinals the final week of February and came away impressed,
calling them an exciting, young, up-and-coming team.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals thought they had him.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Allen swooped in, offered up the Seahawks as an example of
a young team reloaded for a playoff run, and reinforced his
argument with an offer of a $5 million signing bonus in a $13.5
million deal over five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Always the money is important,'' said Watters, whose only
question to Allen was, ``Where do I sign?''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals couldn't match that signing bonus _ guaranteed
upfront money; yearly salaries in the NFL generally are make-good
only _ and Watters quickly became a Seahawk on March 4.
</P>
<P>
   Feagles signed &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Allen took another bite out of the Cardinals when he offered
their punter, Jeff Feagles, an unprecedented $1.06 million signing
bonus. Feagles is a Valley native who'd had four productive seasons
with the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   But Cardinals owner Bill Bidwill couldn't compete with such a
huge guarantee, so the free-agent Feagles packed up and headed to
the Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   In all, Allen has shelled out slightly more than $47 million in
guaranteed signing bonuses to 12 key players since he took control
of the team in June 1997 from the Behring family.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Paul, obviously we've gone out and been more active in
free agency,'' said Seahawks Coach Dennis Erickson, whose future
with the team has been enhanced by improved personnel. ``He has
enabled us to do things with upfront money to get players in here.
That's what it's all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen describes himself as an idea man, a visionary. His
interests are broad, and he is anything but stingy with his wealth.
</P>
<P>
   He bought the Seahawks not only to keep them in his native
Seattle but also because he and his nephews like football. One
night while visiting the kids, he asked his sister if she liked
football. When the answer was yes, his decision was made _ if the
public would help him replace the aging Kingdome, a structure that
has been deemed not to be earthquake proof.
</P>
<P>
   Vote of confidence &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So he took his case to the public. His purchase was contingent
upon passage of Referendum 48 in 1997. Allen said he would be
personally responsible for any cost overruns, which already have
topped $30 million before ground has been broken. Opponents brought
consumer crusader Ralph Nader to town. Nader was no match for
Allen, who made a rare public appearance in a TV ad for the
project.
</P>
<P>
   When the state's voters agreed to spend $300 million for their
portion, Allen, celebrated at Seattle's historic Union Station,
which Allen is spending millions to restore, by cranking up his own
electric guitar and jamming.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really stepped to the plate on the stadium issue,''
Erickson said. ``It's great for the team and great for the city of
Seattle.''
</P>
<P>
   Groundbreaking is scheduled for Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Seahawks, the Cardinals are a rebuilding team trying to
get a better facility.
</P>
<P>
   Allen certainly has been more proactive in the community on his
stadium issue than Bill Bidwill, owner of the Cardinals, has been
on his, although Bidwill's son, Michael, has been a key mover and
shaker in the proposed Rio Salado Crossing project.
</P>
<P>
   And while Bidwill couldn't match the signing bonuses that Allen
offered down the line, it might be surprising to know that Bidwill
has paid two signing bonuses higher than any Allen has ever paid,
$7.5 million to defensive tackle Eric Swann in February, and $10.49
million to rookie Andre Wadsworth last week.
</P>
<P>
   Like Bidwill &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bidwill and Allen are more alike than people might imagine.
</P>
<P>
   They're both perceived as reclusive, although neither really is.
Both guard their privacy. Among acquaintances, though, they're
gregarious and fun-loving. Allen recently cut his trademark long
hair and shaved his beard because he said too many people had begun
to recognize him. Now clean-cut with dark-rimmed glasses, he
resembles the computer nerd most incorrectly believed him to be.
Yet Allen, 45, annually pops up on the list of most eligible
bachelors in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to comparing wallets, neither Bidwill nor any
other NFL owner can keep up with Allen, who also owns the NBA
Portland Trail Blazers and the new facility in which they play, the
Rose Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Allen, driven by his love of the music of Jimi Hendrix, is
building a rock and roll museum at Seattle Center, best known for
the Space Needle. Allen has his own garage rock band and built a
recording studio for him and his pals.
</P>
<P>
   He throws big-time parties for big-time celebrities _ everywhere
from Cannes, France, to the world's ritziest cruise ship off the
coast of Alaska. The cruise guest list included Bill and Melinda
Gates; actresses Debbie Reynolds, Candace Bergen, Carrie Fisher and
Penny Marshall; actors Robin Williams, Dan Aykroyd and Jeff
Goldblum; moviemakers Francis Ford Coppola and ``Titanic'' director
James Cameron; former NBA star Clyde Drexler, who played for Allen
in Portland; and musician Quincy Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Allen organized a masked ball in Venice for 300 friends last
year.
</P>
<P>
   He is altruistic as well as hedonistic. Last year, Allen donated
$32.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   He clearly is a man who loves life, driven by the scare of
losing it when he was diagnosed in 1983 with Hodgkin's disease.
That's why he left Microsoft. The disease is in remission.
</P>
<P>
   But Allen is rich because he is visionary. He sees the next wave
of technology being tied to fiber optics, something he calls
``Wired World.'' He explains his ``Wired World'' philosophy, and
his projects that have touched every aspect of Northwest life _
from the arts to environment, recreation, medical research,
education and the economy _ on his own Web site ( &UR; www &QL; 
 &UR; .paulallen.com).
</P>
<P>
   ``I was always thinking about the future as a kid,'' Allen told
the ``Seattle Times'' in a rare interview last year. ``When you're
a kid, you think anything is possible. You don't know about
constraints.''
</P>
<P>
   He still doesn't. &QL;

UCLA BEATS TEXAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ To answer coach Bob Toledo's greatest
offseason concern _ could the Bruins start 1998 as they ended 1997
_ the answer is yes.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, yes, yes.
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't 66-3. This was !ital!worse!off!. Last year, UCLA
needed eight Texas turnovers to whip the Longhorns in Austin. This
year, UCLA whipped 'em without the mistakes and whipped 'em where
it counts most _ at the line of scrimmage, at the point of contact.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked like a well-oiled machine early,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   The final score, 49-31, before 73,070 at the Rose Bowl, was
misleading. So was the Longhorns' 21-point fourth quarter. By then,
UCLA was in cruise control and playing third-stringers on defense.
Kory Lombard? Steve Sua? Ali Abdul Azziz? Please. If the game's in
doubt, these guys are on the bench, not the field.
</P>
<P>
   What mattered was the first half, when UCLA built a 35-3 lead
and dominated a Texas team that had no turnovers and just two
penalties.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 6 Bruins were too fast, too strong and too sound in
setting a school record with their 11th consecutive victory. They
made the big plays and they made the little ones, like fullback
Durell Price's conversions on third-and-short and quarterback Cade
McNown's block on a flanker reverse.
</P>
<P>
   It was as if 10 days had passed since the Bruins overwhelmed
Washington 52-28 _ not 10 months.
</P>
<P>
   They scored touchdowns on five of six possessions in the first
half, averaging 14.2 yards per pass, 6.2 yards per rush and
outgaining Texas 379-116.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a great football team,'' Longhorns coach Mack Brown
said. ``UCLA didn't make any mistakes at all in the first half.
They didn't make any turnovers, and Cade hit everyone perfectly.''
</P>
<P>
   McNown completed 20 of 30 passes for 339 yards and three
touchdowns, but he was not alone in accomplishment. Receiver
Freddie Mitchell gained 250 all-purpose yards and threw a 34-yard
touchdown in his first game as a Bruin. Tailback Jermaine Lewis
rushed for 113 yards and two touchdowns in his first start, often
scooting untouched into the Texas secondary. Skip Hicks, Jermaine
Lewis, Jerry Lewis _ anyone could have run through those holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely blocked them better (than last year),'' guard
Andy Meyers said. ``As an offensive line, this was the best game
I've seen in several years for a (season opener). The line was
very, very good.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins' defense contained Texas All-American Ricky Williams
long enough to put the game out of reach. He finished with 160
yards rushing, but 97 came after UCLA built a 35-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're ahead by that much, it's hard to stay fired up,''
Bruins linebacker Tony White said. ``But that's what makes a
championship team, when you get up and keep them down.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins stacked the line of scrimmage with eight defenders
and dared Texas quarterback Richard Walton to beat them through the
air. He could not, and that was the biggest difference. While
McNown was fabulous in long-yardage situations, Walton was futile.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing was they got a lot of big plays,'' Texas
linebacker Dusty Renfro said. ``McNown is very accurate, and he'll
kill you when they go to air.''
</P>
<P>
   McNown wielded his aerial dagger early and often. He hit Brian
Poli-Dixon for 16 yards on the game's second play. On the fifth, he
found Mitchell for 16 more, pushing UCLA past midfield and
triggering a flanker pass from Mitchell to Poli-Dixon. It worked
perfectly and gave the Bruins a 7-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (trick play) was a scripted situation,'' Toledo said.
``The first time we crossed the 50, we were going to run it.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA extended its lead to 14-0 a few minutes later, but the
Longhorns responded with their best drive of the half, moving
effortlessly from their 19 to the Bruins' 25.
</P>
<P>
   The game turned on third-and-five when Walton, unable to
improvise, threw 3 yards and killed the drive. Texas had wasted its
first _ and only _ chance to stay within range of McNown's machine.
The Longhorns settled for a field goal, which quickly became
obsolete when Lewis scampered for his second score and a 21-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about jumping on them early so we'd take the revenge
factor out real quick,'' Lewis said. ``That's what we tried to do _
score on every drive and show the nation we're for real.''

REVENGE-SEEKING TEXAS TECH ROUTS NORTH TEXAS, 30-0
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Fred Pertile spent the summer back in Midland,
preparing for this upcoming season and talking a little trash to
his friends playing for Texas Tech.
</P>
<P>
   Pertile, a sophomore linebacker at North Texas, relished in
reminding them of Tech's surprising loss to a 30-point underdog UNT
team last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We beat them,'' Pertile said, ``but tonight they ``really''
beat us.''
</P>
<P>
   Tech exacted a measure of revenge, handing UNT a 30-0 loss last
night at Texas Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   UNT upset and embarrassed Tech with a 30-27 victory in Week 4
last season in Lubbock. Tech looked anything but upset and
embarrassed last night.
</P>
<P>
   The offense was decent. The defense was salty. The results were
obvious.
</P>
<P>
   Tech held UNT to 125 yards in total offense while racking up 531
yards for themselves. The Eagles managed just five first downs
while the Red Raiders had 30. Tech scored. UNT didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we are horrendous on offense, and that's nobody's
fault but mine,'' Eagles coach Darrell Dickey said. ``We don't have
a running play that we can hang our hat on, that we can execute
real well and make a few yards, and that's something we're going to
have to address _ very quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Tech coach Spike Dykes: ``The defense controlled the game
to a point where we didn't have a chance to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Tech nailed down the necessary points for winning with a single
play, a perfectly delivered pass from Matt Tittle to Donnie Hart.
</P>
<P>
   Tittle, a Marcus High School graduate, delivered a perfectly
placed ball to Hart for a 44-yard touchdown on Tech's opening play
from scrimmage. Two touchdowns and a barrage of field goals
followed as UNT struggled to slow Tech.
</P>
<P>
   Tittle finished 16-of-27 for 257 yards with a touchdown and
three interceptions while Red Raiders tailback Ricky Williams added
170 yards on 28 rushes with two touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   UNT had 68 yards rushing in all, and failed to convert four Tech
turnovers into any points.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came out and were talking a little trash about last year,
and they were getting hot,'' Eagles offensive lineman Phillip
Armour said. ``You could tell that last year was their prime
motivation.''
</P>
<P>
   Dykes said the loss had sat with his players all year. ``The
only way to do something about it is to shut up and play,'' Dykes
said. ``I thought our guys did a nice job of shutting up and
playing.''
</P>
<P>
   And now this summer, they will be able to talk.
</P>
<P>
   Pertile knows it is coming, the payback for a summer of popping
last season's game into the VCR when Tech's Antwan Alexander and
John Norman were visiting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll try to forget it, but I know that John and Antwan won't
let me,'' Pertile said. ``I know they will not let me live it
down.'' &QL; 
EXTRA POINTS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Waxahachie's Montae Reagor recorded two tackle for a loss,
passing Zach Thomas for Tech's all-time lead with 30. ... Tech
hadn't gone 2-0 to open a season since 1989. ... UNT's Lawrence
Ellis, Heath Moody and Jeff Rodgers all snagged their first career
interceptions against Tech. ... UNT quarterback Chase Corley took
his first collegiate snap last night in relief of Jason Attaway.
His first completion was a 33-yard pass to Broderick McGrew. He was
3-of-8 for 47 yards. ... Tech kicker Jaret Greaser strained a groin
muscle in the third quarter, and was replaced by Chris Birkholz,
who made his first career field goals (43 and 45 yards). ... UNT
finished with eight offsides penalties on defense. ... UNT punter
and All-America candidate John Baker averaged 45.3 yards in eight
attempts yesterday.

REDSKINS' QB SWAP SHOWS SIGNS OF PANIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   They were the popular pick to win the NFC East, the team that
spent about $58 million on twin defensive tackles  &UR; Dana
Stubblefield and  &UR; Dan
 &UR; Wilkinson.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the Washington Redskins should have found themselves a
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Coach  &UR; Norv Turner benched starter  &UR; Gus Frerotte in the second
half of last week's loss at the New York Giants and has replaced
him for Monday night's game against San Francisco with a guy who
has thrown one pass in five years in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Going to  &UR; Trent Green one game into the season isn't just
bizarre, it's a panic move.
</P>
<P>
   Even Green, the team's third-string quarterback as of two weeks
ago, was stunned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always prepare myself like it could happen, but to think
this was going to happen in the second week . . .'' Green said.
</P>
<P>
   Why shouldn't Green be surprised?
</P>
<P>
   He was the 222nd of 224 players taken in the 1993 draft out of
Indiana, then was cut by the San Diego Chargers after his rookie
year. He was unemployed in '94 until he took a job selling
furniture in Bloomington, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   Green didn't give up his dream to start in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd basically bug everybody,'' he said. ``I'd say, `Hey, I'm
still out there, still working. Keep me in mind.'''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Green played for the British Columbia Lions of the
Canadian League before signing with the Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   A year earlier, the Redskins spent the third pick overall in the
draft on Tennessee quarterback  &UR; Heath Shuler and a seventh-round
choice on Frerotte. Shuler was cut after the '96 season, and
Frerotte's job now is in trouble, especially because he also has a
shoulder injury.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't help Frerotte any that after throwing his second
interception in the third quarter a week ago, linebacker  &UR; Marvcus
 &UR; Patton got in Frerotte's face on the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm emotional on the field,'' Patton said. ``Football's an
emotional game. Things just happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner had to break up the teammates. Amazingly, Turner defended
Patton's actions, saying, ``He's trying to keep Gus going. He's
trying to keep him focused and in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Those statements sound as if they are coming from a coach who
has lost control of his team and could be on the hot seat.
</P>
<P>
   Turner is 26-38-1 in four years and hasn't taken the Redskins to
the playoffs. Now, the team is up for sale, which won't help
Turner's security.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, I was pretty upset,'' Frerotte said of Patton's
sideline display. ``I was in a lot of pain. I had a couple of bad
plays, but you don't have to tell me when I made a bad play. If
anybody knows it, I do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marvcus and I talked. He apologized. He's an emotional guy.
We've all been through two rough years.'' &QL; 
Dirty pool &QL; 
Stubblefield never thought he would leave the San Francisco 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a time when I just knew they cannot get rid of me or
B.Y. (defensive tackle Bryant Young),'' Stubblefield said.
``They're not going to separate us. I just knew for sure that they
had lost their mind if they got rid of one of us. It was a definite
surprise when things didn't work out between me and the Niners
because I just knew it would. I took it at first like, `OK, they
don't want me, forget them.' ''
</P>
<P>
   He'll be lined up against 14-year veteran  &UR; Ray Brown but also is
expected to face right guard  &UR; Kevin Gogan on some plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing about Ray, I know he's not going to try to cut me or
cheap-shot me or doing anything illegal like that,'' Stubblefield
said. ``I know Gogan (will), but Ray won't.''
</P>
<P>
   Gogan has the reputation as a cheap-shot artist. In fact, he was
thrown out of last year's Pro Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poor Stubby,'' Gogan said. ``I wouldn't like to do it to him,
but if I have to, I will. I might get my hands on him a few
times.'' &QL; 
Rough ride &QL; 
Former Detroit Lions Coach  &UR; Wayne Fontes has made a workers'
compensation claim against the team because of a back injury.
</P>
<P>
   Fontes claims he suffered on-the-job injuries during his eight
years with the team that have resulted in permanent disability.
</P>
<P>
   As evidence, he said he had to ride around in a golf cart his
final few seasons because standing on the sidelines was too hard on
his back.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a special man to claim incapacitation and then go out
and play in numerous charity golf outings,'' Lions Vice President
 &UR; Tom
 &UR; Lewand said. &QL; 
Right choice &QL; 
When the Pittsburgh Steelers had a coaching opening in 1992,
 &UR; Bill &UR; Cowher was picked over  &UR; Dave Wannstedt, &UR; who wound up with the
Chicago Bears.
</P>
<P>
   Cowher goes into today's game against the Chicago Bears with a
70-38 record, six playoff appearances, five AFC Central titles and
one Super Bowl berth.
</P>
<P>
   Wannstedt is 36-45 and led the Bears to playoffs only once.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our three highest-paid players last year were
( &UR; Alonzo) &UR; Spellman, &UR; ( &UR; Bryan) &UR; Cox and  &UR; Rick Mirer,'' Wannstedt said.
``And none of them is on the team (this year). That kind of sums it
up why we're backed into a corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We missed on way too many draft picks. But the reason we're
backed into a corner is because we've missed on and made mistakes
in the personnel area and free agency that a lot of teams haven't
made, primarily the Steelers.'' &QL; 
Spectacular debut &QL; 
Minnesota Vikings rookie wide receiver  &UR; Randy Moss was so
impressive in his first pro game that teammate  &UR; Robert Smith
already is predicting Moss will make the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm serious,'' he said. ``You could see it after the first day
of practice. There is nothing he can't do. Anybody who said they
knew he was going to be this good, they're just not telling the
truth. If NFL teams thought he was going to be this good, you think
he would have dropped all the way to 21 (in the draft)?''
</P>
<P>
   Moss scored on his first two receptions against Tampa Bay a week
ago, one from 48 yards and the other from 31.
</P>
<P>
   Reunited &QL; 
Buffalo Bills quarterback  &UR; Doug Flutie and Miami Dolphins Coach
 &UR; Jimmy &UR; Johnson will be on the same field today for the first time
since Flutie's 48-yard pass on the final play gave Boston College a
47-45 victory over Johnson's Miami Hurricanes in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Flutie said he is asked about the play nearly every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's someone who recognizes you and wants to approach
you but doesn't know what to say, they'll bring that up as an
icebreaker,'' Flutie said. ``A lot of times people want to tell you
the story of where they were when they saw it. They'll say they
were in a bar, or they were having Thanksgiving dinner, or they
turned the TV set off after Miami scored.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather be remembered for the skillful things I did rather
than a prayer of a pass I threw. But at least there's a signature
play people do remember you by.'' &QL;

BRUINS EARN RIGHT TO BOAST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ In college football, there are two ways, one
new and one old, to be a national-championship contender.
</P>
<P>
   The new way, introduced this season, is to earn a spot in the
Jan. 4 Fiesta Bowl between No.1 and No.2 through a rating formula
that multiplies your team's AP ranking, its Nielsen share, its
mortgage interest deduction, its coach's mother's birth month and
the square of the hypotenuse.
</P>
<P>
   The old way is to simply declare yourself a candidate, early and
loudly, on the field and in the locker room. Which UCLA did
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think,'' right guard Andy Meyers said after the Bruins
defeated Texas 49-31, ``this proves we're a contender for the
national championship.''
</P>
<P>
   And so they are.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can make those statements,'' said do-it-all freshman
Freddie Mitchell, ``when you've worked hard in the summer
(practice).''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike recent UCLA teams, who said goodbye to perfect seasons in
September, this one overpowered its first opponent, and a ranked
opponent at that, doing it with a shocking array of weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike recent UCLA teams, comprised of polite young men who let
the results do the talking, this one will demand attention from the
championship voters.
</P>
<P>
   Not that brash talk comes naturally to them. A couple of school
records were set at the Rose Bowl, and one was for repetition of
the phrase, ``one game at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   And for a while there, listening to quarterback Cade McNown and
head coach Bob Toledo during his postgame press conference, you
might have thought Texas had won.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hat is off to Texas,'' McNown said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to give credit to Texas,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   They were being nice to a team they defeated 66-3 in 1997 and
were thrashing no less convincingly Saturday _ 35-3 in a first half
without turnovers _ before boredom set in.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo doesn't want his team tripping over its tongue.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of our goals,'' he said of the national
championship, which would be the Bruins' second, UCLA having shared
the title with Ohio State in 1954. ``But I want them talking about
one game at a time. We're not there yet. We're not a finished
product.''
</P>
<P>
   But the message from this one game is unmistakable.
</P>
<P>
   Anybody who thought a Heisman Trophy for McNown is all the
Bruins had to fight for this year can dream a little higher.
</P>
<P>
   The players have known it all along. This season, the first in
which a Pacific-10 champion can bypass the Rose Bowl for a 1 vs. 2
showdown, the Bruins used that as an incentive to start fast after
failing to go 3-0 since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   One thing everybody understands about the weird new rating
formula is the best strategy is: don't lose.
</P>
<P>
   Texas, fired up over last year's embarrassment and primed by a
season-opening rout of New Mexico State, was a big bullet to dodge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought they were good going in, so I wasn't surprised,''
Texas coach Mack Brown said, calling UCLA's first-half performance
``a perfect game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We made more good plays in the first half than we did against
New Mexico State, but it wasn't obvious because UCLA was so good.''
</P>
<P>
   Are the Bruins national title material?
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you start in the top 10, you're as talented as they
and you've got a quarterback as skilled as McNown is, you've got
what it takes to be a national champion,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA is ranked sixth. (Texas is No. 23.)
</P>
<P>
   UCLA completed passes to nine receivers, including Mitchell (who
had a 79-yard touchdown catch and run) and sophomore Brian
Poli-Dixon (who had two touchdowns). It found a reasonable
facsimile of Skip Hicks in sophomore Jermaine Lewis (who rushed for
115 yards and two touchdowns in his first college start) and a
future star in freshman DeShaun Foster (who averaged 6.3 a carry).
</P>
<P>
   McNown was everything the campaign posters promised.
</P>
<P>
   And the defense was a revelation, though it remains to be seen
how much its first-half showing was helped by the big lead, which
blunted the rushing influence of Texas Heisman hopeful Ricky
Williams, and the weak playmaking of Texas quarterback Richard
Walton.
</P>
<P>
   The schedule gets tougher. The Bruins go to Miami, Arizona and
Washington, and face Oregon and USC at home. Any of those could
shut them up.
</P>
<P>
   But for a week at least, they have national-title potential and
a perfect right to talk the talk.

OKLAHOMA RALLIES PAST TCU, 10-9
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By TERRANCE HARRIS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The TCU Horned Frogs found themselves on the
verge of upsetting Oklahoma last night.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the final 2:26 minutes of the game.
</P>
<P>
   And just about anything that could have gone wrong did for TCU
in its home opener at Amon Carter Stadium. Missed offensive
opportunities. A defensive secondary letdown. An onside kick. An
interception-turned fumble. The waning seconds field-goal
conversion. And then the postgame brawl.
</P>
<P>
   When it was all clear, the Sooners had stolen one from TCU,
10-9.
</P>
<P>
   In the final analysis, a stellar defensive performance by the
Frogs became a victim of circumstance when Oklahoma kicker Jeff
Ferguson converted a 40-yard field goal with 10 seconds remaining
to cap a 10-0 rally by the Sooners in the final 2:26.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one was a hard one to lose,'' said TCU coach Dennis
Franchione, whose team moved to 1-1. ``One play makes the
difference in college football. And there were a lot of them that
could have made a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs had held their ground and a 9-0 lead (three Chris
Kaylakie field goals) for nearly the entire second half before
things came unglued. Their lack of offensive production and the
Sooners' athletic ability finally caught up to them.
</P>
<P>
   But even with teary eyes and solemn facial expressions, the
players talked more about rebounding than about what went wrong in
their second consecutive matchup with a Big 12 team.
</P>
<P>
   ``A loss like this is certainly disappointing, but it's not the
end of the world for us,'' senior defensive end Kam Hunt said.
``You hate to ever lose, but this was a nonconference game, and we
have to keep on going.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are brighter days ahead for this football team.''
</P>
<P>
   And after an impressive outing against Iowa State, first-year
quarterback Patrick Batteaux often seemed uncertain and impatient
against an athletic Oklahoma defensive front.
</P>
<P>
   Batteaux gained just 24 yards on 16 carries, while completing
two of 12 pass attempts for 17 yards. And senior tailback Basil
Mitchell had eclipsed 100 yards rushing only to have losses late in
the game reduce him to 89 yards on 12 carries for the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs have a week off before opening the Western Athletic
Conference season on Sept. 26 at home against Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to get better on offense, there's no doubt about
that,'' Franchione said. ``There's not an aspect of the offense
that we can't improve.
</P>
<P>
   ``But at the same time, you can't take anything away from the
Oklahoma defense. They are a stout group.''
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma (2-0) began its improbable rally when quarterback
Patrick Fletcher placed a perfectly thrown pass over defensive back
Greg Walls and into the outreached hands of receiver Chris Blocker
in the left corner of the end zone for a 21-yard touchdown
reception. Then came a mishandled onside kick that ended up in the
grasp of Oklahoma's Chris Hammons at the Frogs' 47.
</P>
<P>
   Two plays later, TCU linebacker Joseph Phipps appeared to
salvage the Frogs when he snared his third interception of the
evening only to fumble it away at the TCU 23. Four plays later, the
Sooners' comeback was complete.

BULLDOG HELLING RANGERS' BEST BET TO WIN A BIG GAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ Ever the bulldog, Rick Helling won his
19th game of the season last night.
</P>
<P>
   Ever the Doberman, Helling was ready to launch the missiles in
the fifth inning, just to make a point.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, it does appear, will not skip merrily to any
division title this season. On the contrary, if they get there,
they will likely have to do it growling and clawing.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Helling.
</P>
<P>
   He snarls. He battles. He wins games.
</P>
<P>
   Last night at Tropicana Field, with the added parlay of an
Anaheim defeat already in the bank, Helling delivered again.
Growling and clawing, he weathered an inconsistent first five
innings, but ended up pitching eight.
</P>
<P>
   The 27-year-old right-hander's 19th victory fueled the Rangers'
8-2 triumph against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.
</P>
<P>
   And as the bottom of the fifth inning began last night, Helling,
citing the law of the jungle, was ready to chunk it all.
</P>
<P>
   In the top half, his pitching counterpart and former teammate,
Julio Santana, had responded to back-to-back Rangers home runs by
sailing a smoke-alarm fastball past Lee Stevens' chin. Umpire Larry
McCoy promptly walked from behind the plate and issued both teams a
warning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, at that point, that four innings were going to be
my max tonight,'' Helling related.
</P>
<P>
   This is the same Rick Helling who, as a 21-year-old Olympian,
didn't think twice about brushing back the blustery Cubans. This is
the same Helling who, on Rafael Palmeiro's ``homecoming'' to The
Ballpark, launched one behind Raffy's ear.
</P>
<P>
   His response last night, after hearing umpire McCoy's
no-headhunting warning, was vintage Helling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get the 'pen ready,'' he told pitching coach Dick Bosman as he
prepared to take the mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never like to see your hitters get thrown at,'' Helling
explained, with no visible semblance of remorse. ``I feel like it's
my job to protect them.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, a vanguard of cooler heads promptly intervened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I guess three or four guys must have heard me,'' Helling
said, ``because they jumped up and said, `No, no. Don't do that.
We'll get them some other time. We need you out there.'''
</P>
<P>
   Reluctantly, Helling accepted the leash and behaved himself.
</P>
<P>
   He's not bad, you see. He just pitches that way.
</P>
<P>
   And on a team of kindly all-for-one musketeers, isn't a genuine
chippy character like Helling an intriguing change?
</P>
<P>
   If you had any doubts, last night again should have resolved
them. The Rangers have no better starting pitcher with a ``must''
game on the line. And this is a ``must'' road trip, especially
after launching the itinerary Friday by stumbling, 3-2, to the
last-place Devil Rays.
</P>
<P>
   A poignant scene had started the night. A knot of Rangers had
gathered in Danny Wheat's training room and, huddled around a
laptop computer, tracked the end of the Angels' game at Baltimore.
When word spread that the Orioles had come back from a 2-0 deficit
to win with three runs in the bottom of the ninth, a ripple of
light, but noticeable, approval ran through the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it's our turn,'' a voice shouted.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Helling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first five innings were really a grind,'' the pitcher
recounted. ``But the last three, I felt like I was in a groove.''
</P>
<P>
   Helling teetered in the second inning and then let a run in and
left the bases loaded in the third. He had two outs and a Devil Ray
on third in the fifth inning when he allowed back-to-back singles
by Fred McGriff and Bubba Trammell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sent Bosman out there to chew him out,'' manager Johnny
Oates said. ``He had two strikes on both of those guys, and rather
than challenge them, he threw two get-me-over curveballs. Bos had
to go out there and remind him, `Let's go and get after it.'''
</P>
<P>
   That's not the usual Helling, of course. The usual Helling is
the one who, between innings, walked over to home-plate ump McCoy
and wanted to _ how shall we put this? _ waive responsibility for
anything that was about to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to make sure he had warned us,'' Helling said.
``I told the umpire, `Well, I'm still going to throw inside.' He
just answered, `I know. But I know the difference.'''
</P>
<P>
   On this night, however, Helling heeded his manager's caution.
Order prevailed. Teeth were bared, but that's Rick Helling.
</P>
<P>
   He growls. He battles. He wins games.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest games.

CANIDATE STARTS HIS RUN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   STANFORD, Calif. _  &UR; Trung Canidate went from casualty candidate
to game ball contender.
</P>
<P>
   The transformation took a couple of seconds.
</P>
<P>
   On Arizona's fifth play from scrimmage Saturday at Stanford
Stadium, Canidate did what had had not done for more than nine
months.
</P>
<P>
   He carried the football.
</P>
<P>
   For 11 yards.
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of the day, there would be 20 more carries and 99
more yards.
</P>
<P>
   Goodbye, stress fracture. Hello, season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little rusty out there,'' Canidate said after his
first game since recovery from a stress fracture to his right foot.
``But the offensive line made it easy for me. I can't complain.''
</P>
<P>
   Other than Stanford, neither can anybody else.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats gained a mediocre 133 yards rushing in a
season-opening victory at Hawaii 10 days ago. In the 31-14 victory
at Stanford, it was an effective, Canidate-to-contender 223.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trung runs so hard,'' said  &UR; Keith Smith, who continued to
share quarterback duties with  &UR; Ortege Jenkins. ``He just blows
through the hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trung makes such a difference. He kind of levels out the whole
offense. He allows you to do other things.''
</P>
<P>
   Canidate didn't start. Those duties fell to reliable  &UR; Kelvin
Eafon, who scored two touchdowns. But it's clear that Canidate is a
key to the Wildcats' hopes. He promised better days.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I wanted to do was run the ball,'' said Canidate, who has
speed, power and instincts that propel him through imperceptible
cracks in the defense. ``The offensive line gave me some big holes.
They deserve the credit.'' &QL; 
Briefly . . . &QL; 
All-purpose cornerback  &UR; Chris McAlister struggled early but
recovered for one knockdown of a pass attempt and an interception,
the 11th of his career. ``With concentration, I could have had four
picks,'' said McAlister, his own worst critic.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd was announced at 30,096, Stanford's smallest since
1991. In the 85,000-seat stadium, it looked more like 10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe everybody was hiding in the shade. UA's sweat-soaked
coach,  &UR; Dick Tomey, sounded as though he was seeking some. ``Today
was hotter than any day I've experienced in Tucson,'' said Tomey,
who blamed the humidity for all that hot air.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinal has an 11-game schedule and virtually no bowl
hopes. Still, quarterback  &UR; Todd Husak said ``the 12th game is still
a possibility.'' Yeah, if you're counting next year's season
opener.
</P>
<P>
   UA has won six straight games dating to last season. The past
three have been on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Keep 'em down on The Farm and on the UA schedule. UA has won six
straight over Stanford. The Cardinal's last victory was in 1990 in
Tucson. &QL;

NO. 18 TEXAS A&AMP;M DOWNS LOUISIANA TECH, 28-7
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ The Texas A&AMP;M Aggies took a step down
in competition last night, but their performance reinforced the
lessons learned in a season-opening loss to Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   Namely, their defense has a chance to be very, very good. And
their offense has, to be charitable, room for improvement.
</P>
<P>
   The 18th-ranked Aggies defeated Louisiana Tech, 28-7, at Kyle
Field, evening their record at 1-1. The Bulldogs fell to 0-3.
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies did it by dousing the high-octane Bulldogs offense
and by doing just enough when they had the ball.
</P>
<P>
   The defense, which shows signs of earning the ``Wrecking Crew''
moniker given to past attacking, destroying A&AMP;M units, held
Louisiana Tech to 323 yards. That's 201 fewer than the Bulldogs
averaged in their first two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pleased with our defensive effort in controlling a very
good offensive team,'' Aggies coach R.C. Slocum said.
</P>
<P>
   The offense was more methodical than spectacular. It gained 349
yards, including 83 by Dante Hall, 79 and three touchdowns by
D'Andre Hardeman and 134 passing yards by Branndon Stewart. But
that's 162 fewer than the Bulldogs averaged giving up in their
first two games.
</P>
<P>
   Slocum said the conditions were a factor. More than six inches
of rain had fallen since Thursday, and a steady drizzle persisted
throughout the game.
</P>
<P>
   However, the conditions had little to do with A&AMP;M's offensive
line struggling to open holes for the second consecutive game.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom going in said this would be a shootout, with
the Aggies winning a wild one. The A&AMP;M attack didn't do what it was
supposed to do, but then the defense kept the Bulldogs from running
up and down the field.
</P>
<P>
   Make that passing up and down the field.
</P>
<P>
   Bulldogs quarterback Tim Rattay had carved up the first two
defenses he faced this season, including that of fourth-ranked
Nebraska. He passed for 590 yards against the Cornhuskers in the
Bulldogs' season opener, and 524 last week against Central Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Receiver Troy Edwards ran up and down the field in the first two
games after catching Rattay's passes. He had an NCAA-record 405
yards against Nebraska, and 206 yards against Central Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Aggies, Rattay was held to 239 yards. Edwards caught
11 balls for 67 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``They ran a great scheme and had great speed at every
position,'' Louisiana Tech coach Gary Crowton said. ``They are good
at causing turnovers, and hit you in the mouth every time.''
</P>
<P>
   Safety Rich Coady intercepted two passes, including one on the
end zone in the fourth quarter to stop a Bulldogs drive, and
cornerback Jason Webster recovered a fumble to set up a touchdown
drive just before halftime. &QL; 
EXTRA POINTS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A reminder that the ``A'' in A&AMP;M stands for ``Agricultural:'' A
little more than six inches fell on the Kyle Field grass since
Thursday, but there were no visible mud spots and relatively few
slips. ... Edwards was held to less than 100 yards for the first
time since Oct. 11 against Auburn. He had a streak of seven
consecutive games of hitting the century mark. ... The Bulldogs had
239 passing yards, their lowest total since 1996.

PARK HAS BEEN INVALUABLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ It's unofficial. Chan Ho Park is the Los Angeles
Dodgers' MVP for 1998.
</P>
<P>
   There is no voting, but manager Glenn Hoffman said Park's
durability after starters Ramon Martinez and Ismael Valdes went
down with injuries kept the season from being far worse.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman also cited Park's 12-game winning streak at Dodger
Stadium that stretched back to last season and eclipsed the mark
set by Hall-of-Famer Sandy Koufax. Overall this year, Park is 13-8
with a 3.87 ERA and is one victory away from matching last year's
total.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just the way he stepped up all season when we needed
him,'' Hoffman said. ``When starters were out and the bullpen was
down, he took the ball. Those pitch counts really say something.''
</P>
<P>
   Park, who was 14-8 last year with a 3.38 ERA, has won his past
two starts. Each time he threw 136 pitches, about 25 to 30 more
than normal.
</P>
<P>
   Alou for manager?: Felipe Alou has one year left on his contract
with Montreal, but many believe he is the front-runner to replace
Hoffman as Dodgers manager.
</P>
<P>
   Alou was the manager when new Dodgers GM Kevin Malone was the
general manager of Montreal, and the two had an excellent
relationship. In the strike-shortened 1994 season, the Expos had a
74-40 record, the best in the National League.
</P>
<P>
   Malone was forced to trade some of his top players as part of
the Expos' annual salary purge, but Alou has kept his team in
contention until this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't think he doesn't want to win,'' said Dodgers shortstop
Mark Grudzielanek, who played four seasons for Alou. ``He is very
nurturing, but he is also very competitive. He doesn't show it, but
I really think it hurts him deeply every time he has to let an
established player go.''
</P>
<P>
   Another candidate with Malone ties is Davey Johnson, who was
fired last season by Baltimore after winning the AL East. He also
won the National League Central with Cincinnati in 1995 before
getting fired. Johnson reportedly irritates upper management, but
has a good relationship with Malone.
</P>
<P>
   The job is expected to go to someone with major-league
managerial experience. But former Dodger Davey Lopes, a coach in
San Diego, served as a bench coach in Baltimore when Malone was
assistant GM.
</P>
<P>
   Padres notes: Trevor Hoffman's 48th save Friday night was part
of an even bigger record. Since July 24, 1996, San Diego is 169-0
when leading after eight innings.... Joey Hamilton's 1-0 victory
Friday raised his record to 8-1 lifetime against the Dodgers.

 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
Even at less than 100 percent, Randy Johnson is still light-years
ahead of the competition.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Johnson overcame stomach-flu symptoms and a rocky first inning
Saturday to strike out 11 as the Astros tied a club record with
their 96th victory, beating the St. Louis Cardinals 3-2 in the
Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros won their eighth consecutive game _ before a
regular-season-record crowd of 52,493 _ as Craig Biggio hit a
two-run, bases-loaded double off the left-field wall to erase a 2-1
deficit in the seventh inning. With the early-afternoon victory,
the Astros clinched at least a tie for the National League Central
title and reduced to one their magic number for winning the
division outright.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, the Astros gathered in the clubhouse, with
champagne on ice, to watch the Chicago Cubs-Milwaukee Brewers
contest. The Cubs could have clinched the division for the Astros
but rallied from an eight-run deficit to stun the Milwaukee Brewers
15-12.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros did clinch a playoff spot when the New York Mets
lost. The Astros can win their fourth division title (the others
were in 1980, 1986 and 1997) before they take the field tonight if
the Cubs lose to Milwaukee this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're probably better off winning on the field. It
will be a better celebration,'' Astros left fielder Moises Alou
said after the Cubs won.
</P>
<P>
   If the Astros clinch the title today, it will be the earliest an
Astros team has wrapped up its division. ``It's kind of early. I
think we can win one more game,'' Alou said.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis took a two-run first-inning lead off Johnson, who
became ill late Friday. Astros manager Larry Dierker was
considering a pitching switch until two hours before the first
pitch.
</P>
<P>
   After giving up his first runs in the Astrodome this season, the
6-10 lefthander, stomach empty, starved the St. Louis batters over
the next six innings. He struck out the side in the first, fifth
and seventh innings and retired the final 15 batters he faced.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, whose fastball was clocked in the low 90s, somewhat
slower than normal, had enough zip to record his sixth double-digit
strikeout total since he joined the Astros on Aug. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Among his victims was Mark McGwire, who finished 0-for-3 with
three strikeouts, two coming against Johnson. Johnson allowed two
runs and four hits and walked two in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a testament right there that you don't have to throw 95
mph and blow everybody away,'' Johnson (8-1) said. ``The way the
first inning started, I thought it was going to be a short day for
me. Basically, all I was doing was letting them put the ball in
play. I didn't really feel like I had a whole lot behind any of my
pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis scored when Joe McEwing led off with a single and
scored on a double to right by Fernando Tatis, snapping Johnson's
scoreless-innings streak in the Dome at 36.
</P>
<P>
   After a pair of strikeouts, including a called strike to
McGwire, native Ron Gant delivered a run-scoring single.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros answered in the bottom half when Biggio walked, stole
two bases and scored on Derek Bell's grounder to third base off
Darren Oliver (3-3).
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who pitched shutouts in his first four Astrodome
starts, allowed one hit the rest of the day before being relieved
by Scott Elarton to begin the eighth. Billy Wagner pitched a
scoreless ninth for his 29th save.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros were silent after the first inning until Richard
Hidalgo led off the seventh with a double. He advanced on Sean
Berry's sacrifice before a tiring Oliver walked Brad Ausmus and
pinch hitter Pete Incaviglia and Biggio followed with a two-run
double.
</P>
<P>
   The hit was also his club-record 196th. The previous record was
195 by Enos Cabell in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked a little lackluster,'' Dierker said. ``He (Oliver)
kept the ball out of the middle of the strike zone and kept us a
little frustrated. We might have been a little tired from last
night, and they might have been too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to get back after an emotional night game. But we
got it done.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis had the tying run on base in the eighth (Ray Lankford)
with one out when McGwire stepped to the plate to face Elarton, a
22-year-old rookie. Elarton, who gave up home run No. 40 to McGwire
on July 12 at Busch Stadium, caught McGwire looking with a 2-2
curve.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be something I remember forever, coming in my rookie
season and striking out Mark McGwire in his home-run-record year,''
said Elarton. ``He's already got me once this year, so I guess once
is enough. I think it did freeze him a little bit. He hadn't seen
my curve. I was just going to pitch him tough. I wasn't thinking,
`It's Mark McGwire up there.'''

<P>
   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
RANDY Johnson's fastballs can be sickening. This we know. This we
expect.
</P>
<P>
   They are 98-mph lasers that pop into the mitt and send even the
greatest big-league batters back to the dugout, dragging their
bats, tripping over their bottom lips, begging for mercy or a pinch
hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``People expect me to strike out 15 every time,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why Saturday's Astros-St. Louis Cardinals game was
supposed to be a show like no other _ the Cards' Mark McGwire
standing there swinging away at Johnson's heat.
</P>
<P>
   Biceps against Big Unit. McGwire against McCheese.
</P>
<P>
   Try to find the ball if McGwire got a hold of one. Try to find a
radar gun capable of clocking Johnson's fastball when he really
rared back and let one fly, Texas-style, against his former USC
Trojans teammate.
</P>
<P>
   It was a marquee match with a matinee start, everything a
baseball fan could want _ McGwire vs. Johnson and home in time for
dinner, which is why it was hard to find a ticket or anyone not
holding their breath when Johnson strode to the mound.
</P>
<P>
   Little did we know that while everyone was holding their breath,
Johnson was trying to hold down the last remnants of breakfast. He
was sick, the victim of some sort of bug that gripped him Friday
evening and well, let's just say nothing Johnson ate agreed with
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't have anything in his stomach today,'' Astros manager
Larry Dierker said.
</P>
<P>
   Except guts.
</P>
<P>
   Before the bug zapped him, Johnson said he would try to pitch
McGwire as if Johnson were blindfolded _ in other words, ignoring
the 62 home runs and the mighty McGwire aura and simply firing his
heat as usual. Why not? Johnson entered 4-0 in the Dome with an ERA
not even Kenneth Starr could find _ 0.00.
</P>
<P>
   Little did Johnson know he also would be trying to pitch with,
in essence, his hands tied behind his back, the butt of a cigarette
gripped between his teeth and McGwire's gun-barrel biceps cocked
and ready to fire.
</P>
<P>
   This looked like an uncharacteristic firing squad with Johnson
the guest of honor, a rare loss brewing for the Astros in this
record-setting season. Johnson gave up a pair of hits to open the
game and two runs by the time he got out of the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   His fastball clocked a mere 93 mph in the first inning _ ``Like
a changeup,'' Johnson said, a comment that might be like Tiger
Woods saying he won with his ``C'' game if it weren't true.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's usually intimidating stare at batters over the webbing
of his glove was a bit glassy-eyed. He shook his head as if to
clear the cobwebs. He sighed a lot and took deep breaths.
</P>
<P>
   He was sick, not sickening. And things looked good only for the
ball-hawks in the bleachers hoping to catch a McGwire bomb.
</P>
<P>
   But little did we know Johnson's sickness and queasiness merely
served as a symptom for something else that became clear in the 3-2
Astros victory.
</P>
<P>
   He is a pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   We had seen a bit of craftiness from Johnson before, and heard
Dierker and others talk about how impressed they were with the way
Johnson can nibble, confuse and tease batters just like Atlanta's
Greg Maddux but without the bookworm motif.
</P>
<P>
   But never has Johnson shown the full arsenal of his craft like
he did Saturday. He struck out McGwire twice, hitting corners with
sliders and placing his fastball in good spots. Unlike his meals,
he kept the ball down. He threw changeups, for gosh sakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to throw those pitches,'' Johnson said. ``My bag of
tricks was running out.''
</P>
<P>
   After one inning, Johnson brought the baseball back to the
Astros' dugout with him. Why?
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to resort to scuffing the ball, and I didn't want the
umpire to find out,'' Johnson joked.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it was a superstition. But there were many parts of
Johnson's game on display Saturday that he hadn't shown a lot of
before. He hadn't had to. He had never felt the way he felt
Saturday, at least not as an Astro.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of years ago, Johnson said he had a similar bug grip
him before a start against the New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember throwing up in the back of a taxi,'' Johnson said.
``I tipped the guy pretty good. When things like that happen, you
just try to pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Little did we know the marquee show would turn into a clinic.
Little did we know this guy could be finesse. Next thing you know,
Johnson will unveil a knuckleball.

PADRES BEAT DODGERS, CLINCH WEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ The San Diego Padres had 60,823 reasons to clinch
the NL West on Saturday night with the Los Angeles Dodgers in town.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the way they dismantled the Dodgers 8-7, after
trailing by seven runs, that was the truest mark of a champion.
They just never gave up.
</P>
<P>
   In front of the second largest crowd ever to see a game in the
30-year history of Jack Murphy and now Qualcomm Stadium, they
scored three runs in the fifth and five in the sixth to win their
second division title in three years.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres also won the West in 1996 when they overtook the
Dodgers on the season's final weekend. This year, they were
dominant from Opening Day and set a franchise record Friday night
with their 93rd victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers posed a threat in the end before leaving two runners
on base in the ninth as Trevor Hoffman recorded his
major-league-leading 49th save. However, L.A., now 19 games out
with 13 to play, never challenged the Padres in the standings.
</P>
<P>
   For San Diego, it was the 52nd home victory, the best in the
National League and only one fewer than the New York Yankees
major-league high.
</P>
<P>
   And all this without eight-time batting champion Tony Gwynn, who
is sidelined with wrist and Achilles injuries. Gwynn was all over
the ballpark, however. The Padres distributed Tony Gwynn T-shirts
to the crowd and the packed house was a sea of white.
</P>
<P>
   For the Dodgers, Saturday's loss was typical in many ways but
also the worst of the season. Their previous worst game was July
23, when they blew a 6-0 lead to Houston and lost 8-6.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Luke, playing left-field, appeared to give Dodgers starter
Dave Mlicki (8-8) all he needed by driving in five runs in the
first three innings. Eric Karros added a two-run homer in the fifth
off Padres starter Stan Spencer, who was making just his fourth
major-league start.
</P>
<P>
   Mlicki entered the fifth facing just one batter over the
minimum. Things still looked fine when Wally Joyner opened the
inning with his 12th homer. But when Greg Myers followed with a
single and Andy Sheets reached base on a fielding error by third
baseman Adrian Beltre, the mood changed.
</P>
<P>
   Beltre had just entered the game as a defensive replacement for
Bobby Bonilla.
</P>
<P>
   Mlicki then gave up a two-run double to Chris Gomez, cutting the
Dodgers' lead to 7-3.
</P>
<P>
   Mlicki, who entered the game 7-3 in 17 starts since joining the
Dodgers on June 4, just fell apart. And with a bullpen that now
features rookies Sean Maloney and Jeff Kubenka after injuries to
Antonio Osuna and Mark Guthrie, there was little to stop the
madness.
</P>
<P>
   Mlicki opened the sixth by allowing a single to Greg Vaughn,
then walked the next three batters, including Greg Myers with the
bases loaded. He was replaced by Maloney, who hit his first batter,
Andy Sheets, then walked Gomez.
</P>
<P>
   Kubenka allowed a sacrifice fly to pinch-hitter Quilvio Veras
that tied the game at 7. Kubenka, who recorded his first
major-league victory Tuesday in Arizona, retired Steve Finley but
walked Mark Sweeney.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn was the 10th batter of the inning and he gave the Padres
the lead with an RBI single to left. But Luke threw out Gomez at
the plate to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers still had three innings to tie the game, but it
never happened.
</P>
<P>
   They had runners at first and third with one out in the seventh
but didn't score. Former longtime Angels left-hander Mark Langston
came in to face Luke. It was Langston's first relief appearance
since October 1986 _ a span of 331 consecutive starts _ when he
pitched for Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Luke hit a sharp grounder to first off the glove of Joyner, but
Sheets picked up the ball at second and threw to Langston covering
for the out.
</P>
<P>
   Luke was the only batter for Langston, who will be working out
of the bullpen in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Miceli replaced Langston and struck out Mark Grudzielanek,
leaving the go-ahead runs on base.

VICTORY GETS USC TO RARE MARK: 2-0
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC did not gain much prestige with a victory over
San Diego State, but it still turned out to be a significant
result.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans are now 2-0 for only the third time in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   USC also started 2-0 in 1990 and '95, the last time the Trojans
went to the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   With Oregon State up next week, it's a fair bet the Trojans will
get off to a 3-0 start. Last year, USC started its season 0-2.
</P>
<P>
   Say ahhhh: USC's jerseys might not have any player names or
school logos on them, but each Trojan mouthpiece features both.
Look into a player's mouth and you'll see ``USC Trojans'' or an
interlocking ``SC'' smiling back at you.
</P>
<P>
   Inspect a little further and you'll also discover the name of
the owner. Prior to the 1998 season, Dr. Ramon Roges, the director
of EmergencyTrauma and Sports Dentistry at USC, made a mold of each
player's teeth, which he used to form state-of-the-art,
multi-layered compressed mouthpieces.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the custom mouthpieces is made of either cardinal or
gold-colored plastic (sometimes both colors in combinations).
</P>
<P>
   The mouthpieces, which protect the teeth as well as guard
against concussions, are currently used by some colleges, but
mostly NFL teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's inspirational,'' linebacker David Gibson said. ``We've
got a little more tradition and self-pride.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're perfect. I love them,'' wide receiver Mike Bastianelli
added. ``I figured, hey, it's a step up.''
</P>
<P>
   Roges also will be making them soon for the Trojans men's and
women's basketball teams.
</P>
<P>
   Short appearance: San Diego State quarterback Spencer Brinton
sprained his left thumb and was forced to leave the game in the
first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Mixed shoes: Hackett tried to mix up the monotony this week at
practice by wearing two different shoes _ one Nike and one Reebok.
</P>
<P>
   ``They started giggling when they saw it,'' Hackett said of his
players' reaction. ``I just think you need to keep things loose.''
</P>
<P>
   Walk-ons get scholarships: Hackett has given two walk-ons _
tight end Gurjot Dhaliwal and linebacker Rocky Seto _ scholarships
for this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should have heard the football team erupt when we told
them,'' Hackett said.

   FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. _ It was a slip of the tongue, but when Francis
St. Paul was introduced at a post-game gathering as ``St.
Francis,'' it was an accurate description. He made some miraculous
catches and moves, and he helped rescue teammates in need Saturday
night in the Lumberjacks' 38-16 victory over Southwest Texas.
</P>
<P>
   St. Paul, a sophomore wide receiver who was converted from
running back, caught touchdown pases of 60, 23 and 50 yards in the
second half to ignite an NAU offense that floundered in the first
half.
</P>
<P>
   The Lumberjacks (2-0) rebounded from a 13-10 halftime deficit
when Travis Brown, considered one of the top two or three
quarterbacks in Division I-AA, began to show the form that was kept
under wraps in the season opener. When that happened, Southwest
Texas (0-1) began to fall apart.
</P>
<P>
   The win had a dark side, however. Brown, a junior from Moon
Valley High School, sustained an injury to his left elbow after
throwing the 23-yard strike to St. Paul on the first play of the
fourth quarter. He spent the rest of the game with his arm wrapped
and in a sling. He will continue to be evaluated, and his status
for next week's home game against Cal State-Northridge is
uncertain. But before he exited, Brown went over the 7,000-yard
mark in career passing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This hurts a lot,'' said Brown, who seemed to cheer up when
the conversation turned to St. Paul. ``Francis really turned it up
in the second half. We knew it would happen. You can't conceal a
player like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The offensive fireworks, 411 total yards, might be just the
tonic NAU needs to make Coach Jerome Souers' first season a blast.
It was a reversal from last week's 9-0 defensive struggle against
Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did have a strategy in the first half, but you have to
credit Southwest Texas,'' Souers said. ``Our assistant coaches and
players made the adjustment at halftime.''
</P>
<P>
   Souers also said that Clay Brown, who replaced Travis Brown and
hit St. Paul with the 50-yard strike, did an outstanding job. &QL;

REAL WORLD CRASHING AROUND SUN DEVILS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVO, Utah _ Drop the illusions. Lose the fantasy. Forget about
a national championship.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, the Arizona State Sun Devils aren't even the best
football team in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   They are overrated. Paper tigers. A frustrated group that ran
out of bad things to do on a frightful night in Mormon country.
</P>
<P>
   A football team _ in case you've forgotten _ that has lost its
past three regular season games.
</P>
<P>
   A team that has been outscored, 47-16, in the past six quarters.
</P>
<P>
   A team that is 0-2 with an anchor.
</P>
<P>
   The reality: In Tucson, there is reason to brag. In Tempe, there
is reason to sulk.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's too early to panic, especially with a schedule that
softens considerably and a strong whiff of zany parity invading
college football. But a little concern is in order.
</P>
<P>
   How does a passing program such as Brigham Young chew up 214
yards on the ground, pile-driving its way to a 26-6 victory? How
does an offense loaded with weapons get shut out for 49 minutes
against a mediocre, somewhat plodding defense? And how many movies
do they show on that flight to Honolulu for the Jeep Aloha Bowl?
</P>
<P>
   In fairness, the defense took a few baby steps. In Week 1, the
Sun Devils made Brock Huard look like a combination of Ken Stabler
and John Elway. Which he probably is. On Saturday, a jitterbug
named Ronney Jenkins gained a mere 171 yards. But the Sun Devils
blitzed with success. They got after the quarterback. They did some
positive things, keeping their team in the game before exhaustion
set in.
</P>
<P>
   The offense, which looked so good against the Huskies, again
took giant strides. Backward.
</P>
<P>
   Which means it probably will get it right by next week against
North Dallas Forty.
</P>
<P>
   Oh boy.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the opening play of the debacle _ a BYU interception
that was ruled an ASU completion by a napping side judge _ the Sun
Devils lived 60 minutes of Murphy's Law. Dropped passes that
could've been touchdowns. Shanked field goals. Fumbles that
should've been recovered. Late hits on the quarterback and punter.
Tempers that flared out of control.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, the frequent false-start penalty _ perfect for a
team going nowhere fast.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Kealy, a quarterback who is still learning on the job,
didn't get much help. But he was clearly overzealous, caught up in
the moment. He was throwing rockets when a little finesse was
necessary. He needs to develop some touch on his pass. He needs to
take it easy on his receivers, who began treating the football like
a hand grenade.
</P>
<P>
   J.R. Redmond, on the other hand, never had a chance. BYU refused
to kick the ball in his direction, refused to let him win the game
with his legs. In a chance to captivate a national audience and put
some steam behind the publicity drive, he gained 28 yards in 16
carries.
</P>
<P>
   The Heisman Trophy _ yes, the bronze statue _ might have had
more success.
</P>
<P>
   It was ugly stuff, really. After three quarters of choreographed
chaos, the only ``O'' to be found was up on the scoreboard. When
the clock expired, the Sun Devils had salvaged a touchdown, but any
chance at dignity dissolved with a muffed extra point.
</P>
<P>
   So the Sun Devils are scratching their heads. A confused bunch
searching for answers and confidence. A team that is 0-2 for the
first time since 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the problem with college football: Preseason rankings are
not only useless, they are counterproductive. Notre Dame beats
Michigan, then soars in the polls. Except we find out that Michigan
isn't so good, after all. And judging by Saturday's results,
neither is Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   It is all an exercise in nothing. And with the Sun Devils, it
may have hurt the cause. The generous rankings only increased the
pressure. Talk of a national championship made the loss to
Washington sting even more, undoubtedly interfering with the focus
for BYU.
</P>
<P>
   The reality: ASU is a team with eight new starters on defense. A
team with a sophomore quarterback. A team playing in a conference
loaded with talent.
</P>
<P>
   Like the undefeated rival down in Tucson. &QL;

USC ROUTS SAN DIEGO ST.
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ R. Jay Soward admitted he desperately missed
playing for USC in its season opener, but his return Saturday night
demonstrated that the Trojans probably missed him even more.
</P>
<P>
   Soward came back from his one-game suspension for poor academic
performance in high style against San Diego State, catching three
touchdown passes, two in the first half, to lead the Trojans to a
35-6 victory over the Aztecs.
</P>
<P>
   Without Soward, it was hard to imagine where the Trojans would
have been against the stubborn Aztecs, who entered the game a
19-point underdog but stayed close.
</P>
<P>
   Soward's big-play ability quickly emerged in his first game of
the season, and helped keep the Trojans ahead _ albeit
unimpressively.
</P>
<P>
   Soward caught a 53-yard touchdown pass in the second quarter
that ignited the 49,927 at the Coliseum and gave the Trojans a 14-0
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Soward leapt above cornerback Eric Lewis to grab the ball and
breezed into the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   He was far from finished.
</P>
<P>
   After USC defensive end Aaron Williams stripped the ball from
quarterback Brian Russell and recovered the loose ball at the San
Diego State 33-yard line, Soward again put the finishing touches on
a drive.
</P>
<P>
   The junior wide receiver caught an 8-yard touchdown pass from
Mike Van Raaphorst that gave the Trojans a 21-0 advantage.
</P>
<P>
   And just when USC had fallen into a second-half malaise, Soward
came to the rescue in the third quarter. He caught a pass behind
the line of scrimmage and raced 42 yards before being tackled at
the San Diego State 38-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   He scored again in the fourth quarter, pushing USC's lead to
35-6.
</P>
<P>
   Soward also shook things up early by taking a short pass and
sprinting 35 yards into the end zone on his first possession, but
the play was called back for holding.
</P>
<P>
   These big plays were more than enough, however, to prove that
Soward can have more impact than any other USC player on the field.
In fact, he was just about the only Trojan to do anything
offensively against the Aztecs.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from Soward, the Trojans' offense seemed to sputter,
especially in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   USC's special teams, which were near perfect against Purdue, had
a less-than-stellar evening. The Trojans' opening drive stalled and
kicker Adam Abrams missed a 39-yard field goal to snap his string
of 12 straight field goals.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the quarter, Abrams missed a 29-yard attempt, which no
doubt caused some to think back to his struggles the previous two
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   That feeling was reinforced when Abrams missed a 44-yard attempt
in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The first half was a slightly better story for the offense. The
Trojans managed to score a touchdown on their second possession of
the game, driving 66 yards in seven plays. Soward ran 16 yards on a
handoff while Van Raaphorst completed passes to Windrell Hayes (12
yards) and Larry Parker (16 yards).
</P>
<P>
   Morton scored on a 12-yard run to give the Trojans a 7-0 lead,
USC's only points of the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Despite rolling up impressive totals statistically, it took
awhile for the Trojans to convert those gaudy numbers into a
substantial lead.
</P>
<P>
   USC outgained San Diego State in first-half yardage, 302-105,
but managed only a 21-6 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Aztecs ended notions of an early blowout when Russell hit
Damon Gourdine on a 31-yard touchdown pass with 1:01 left in the
half.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: USC wide receiver Billy Miller caught a pass for the 13th
consecutive game.... San Diego State cornerback Tairou Smith was
ejected in the first quarter for a personal foul.

RANDA, TIGERS SINK RED SOX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ You know all the carpe diem optimism generated at
Fenway Park by the arrival of the most futile team in the American
League? Forget about it. From now until the moment the Red Sox fate
is decided, assume nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Surely the Red Sox won't. They lost to the lowly Detroit Tigers,
3-2, Saturday, and, coupled with Toronto's 5-3 defeat of the
Yankees, are only four games ahead of the Blue Jays in the
wild-card race _ just where they stood before Detroit came to town
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The loss dropped the locals to 2-3 on the six-game homestand
that concludes Sunday. The Sox then embark on seven-day road stint
to New York, Baltimore, and Chicago. The trip could move the Sox
closer to wrapping up the wild card or handing it to the Blue Jays,
Rangers, or Angels.
</P>
<P>
   That's why losing to a team with the third worst road record in
baseball (28-46), one that entered the game having lost seven of
their last 10 games, is so costly. But it serves to show that, as
slugger Mo Vaughn put it, no victory should be considered a sure
thing no matter the opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just have to come back (Sunday) with the attitude to win.
No team is just going to come in and lay down for the Red Sox,''
Vaughn said. ``This is really no time to worry about losses. The
thing is we just have to win as many games as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Winning, of course, is no easy task if you can't score runs.
Detroit, beaten by the Sox, 6-2, Friday night, was held scoreless
by starter Pete Schourek through six innings Saturday, but tied the
game, 1-1, when Joe Wood smoked his first major league home run
into the left-field screen in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   The score remained tied until the ninth, when Joe Randa smacked
a two-run homer into the left field screen off Red Sox ace reliever
Tom Gordon (7-4). It was Gordon's first loss since a 3-1 decision
to Detroit July 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hit the ball pretty hard,'' said Gordon. ``He got the pitch
he wanted to hit and he swung and made good contact.''
</P>
<P>
   Pinch hitter Midre Cummings homered in the ninth _ his second
pinch hit home run of the season _ to cut the lead to 3-2, but that
was it. The Red Sox are now 5-4 against the Tigers this season, 2-2
at Fenway.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get into games like this, it's a matter of little
things here and there,'' said Schourek, who remained winless in a
Red Sox uniform after five starts. ``I regret the (home run) pitch
a little bit, obviously because he hit it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it was that terrible a pitch. It was that that
particular one cost us the lead. But when it gets down to crunch
time, everything has to be almost perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Schourek was solid at the start, allowing just Damion Easley's
single through the first three innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing is he pitched good,'' said Red Sox manager Jimy
Williams. ``He kept us in the game. You just have to tip your hat
to the other side, they pitched a little bit better.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el.5l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Detroit starter Bryce Florie didn't get the decision, but he
managed to hold the Red Sox to a single run on three hits through
six innings. Reliever Matt Anderson got the win (4-1), pitching two
scoreless innings, walking one and striking out a pair. Todd Jones
picked up his 24th save of the season, despite allowing Cummings's
blast.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el.5l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't steal first,'' said Williams. ``We didn't get too
many hits today, so we just have to come back (Sunday) and do it
again.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox left seven on base and blew their biggest
opportunity in the fifth. Lewis stole second as Donnie Sadler
struck out. Vaughn was walked intentionally to load the bases.
</P>
<P>
   Before Nomar Garciaparra reached the plate, pitching coach Rick
Adair went to the mound for a conference with Florie and catcher
Joe Siddall. Adair's advice worked. Florie got Garciaparra to
ground to short to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   After that, Boston went hitless until Cummings's home run.
</P>
<P>
   There was no talk of squandering a good opportunity to reduce
the magic number Saturday. ``You just have to go out and win as
many games as you can,'' said John Valentin, who left the game with
a contusion of the right elbow, courtesy of Florie pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers are going to be the numbers, whether whoever wins
(Saturday) or not. (Sunday), we just have to go out and win. If
not, obviously the race gets closer.''

REVOLUTION KEEP PLAYOFF HOPES AFLOAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH _ Goalkeepers are not directly involved in most of
the action in soccer, especially on successful teams. And coaches
are even more peripheral to events, once the match begins.
</P>
<P>
   But Walter Zenga has displayed a winning touch with the
Revolution in both roles. He rallied the team into the MLS playoffs
on the field last year, and he has guided them to within 3 points
of Miami for the final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference this
year after a 2-0 win over Columbus Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   This was the Revolution's second successive two-goal victory in
three games since Zenga replaced Thomas Rongen as coach. They had
been the league's worst defensive team, but they have undergone a
transformation, surrendering only one goal in the last five halves
of play.
</P>
<P>
   Zenga has organized the defense, and Saturday night played
tactician with an effective 3-5-2 alignment and strategic
substitutes to counter Columbus's second-half rally.
</P>
<P>
   Joe-Max Moore curled in a 20-yard free kick in the 31st minute
as the Revolution capitalized on a generous foul call by referee
Jose Manuel Garcia-Aranda. The Revolution retained their poise
after Columbus substitute Jeff Cunningham hit the post midway
through the second half. And Jair, who replaced Carlos Rocha,
clinched the win, converting after Moore went down in the penalty
area in the 84th minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``My players played a hard game against a very strong team,''
Zenga said. ``I did nothing special. I asked something of the
players in midfield and defense and they did it. But there is a
long way to go before we are a great team.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his sort of modifield catenaccio style, referring to
the Italian version of defensive soccer, Zenga said:
</P>
<P>
   ``If catenaccio means playing good defense and with a good
mentality, not giving space to the other team, then I like it. We
didn't give space, we were compact, made them play wide, and we
tried to score goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Columbus has been a much more explosive offensive team, but the
Revolution stymied striker Stern John and midfielder Andy Williams
with some rough play and luck. Williams was twice taken down in the
penalty area, but did not gain the benefit of the doubt from Garcia
Aranda, to the delight of the 35,462 who attended a doubleheader
that included the US's 9-0 win over Mexico in a US Women's Cup
game.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution have gained composure under Zenga. The
galvanization process began in the second half of Zenga's first
game as coach, when they rallied to tie from a two-goal deficit but
lost to Miami, 3-2. They took a 2-0 victory against the MetroStars
in East Rutherford, N.J., then Saturday won at home for the second
time since May 10.
</P>
<P>
   Zenga has mostly fine-tuned the team. He placed Paul Keegan in
defensive midfield, started Rocha at striker, and went with a
three-man defense of Richard Goulooze flanked by Brian Dunseth and
Manny Motajo.
</P>
<P>
   The Crew, which is chasing D.C. United for first place in the
Eastern Conference, threatened at the end of the first half as
Brian McBride headed off the side of the net. Garcia Aranda
cautioned three Revolution players in the first 15 minutes of the
second half. And as the Revolution tired, Zenga pulled Rocha for
Jair to keep possession. But Jair provided a bonus, his third goal
of the year and first since returning from an ankle injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``For my team I always want progress and for them not to lose
concentration,'' Zenga said. ``I don't like to compare now and
before. Every game is different, every season is a different
situation. I am sad because of the second half against Miami. I
would like to see if we had tied that game, 2-2, what it would be
like in Miami now.''

USC BEATS SAN DIEGO STATE

<P>
   R. Jay Soward admitted he desperately missed playing for USC in
its season opener, but his return Saturday night demonstrated that
the Trojans probably missed him even more.
</P>
<P>
   Soward came back from his one-game suspension for poor academic
performance in high style against San Diego State, catching two
touchdown passes and returning a punt for a touchdown to lead the
Trojans to a 35-6 victory before 49,927 at the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   Without Soward, it was hard to imagine where the Trojans would
have been against the stubborn Aztecs, who entered the game a
19-point underdog but stayed close until the final eight minutes,
when USC added two touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Soward's big-play ability quickly emerged in his first game of
the season, and helped keep the Trojans ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fun,'' Soward said matter-of-factly about his
performance.
</P>
<P>
   He ended up with 256 total yards while touching the ball just
nine times, for an average of 28.4 yards per carry.
</P>
<P>
   ``He runs by people and he runs through people,'' USC coach Paul
Hackett said. ``He's a marvelous football player.''
</P>
<P>
   Soward caught a 53-yard touchdown pass in the second quarter
that ignited the crowd and gave the Trojans a 14-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Soward leaped above cornerback Eric Lewis to grab the ball and
breezed into the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Soward was virtually the entire USC offense, aside from tailback
Chad Morton's 110 yards rushing. His 74-yard punt return for a
touchdown put the finishing touches on the night, giving the
Trojans a 35-6 lead with 5:50 left.
</P>
<P>
   He also had the critical plays in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   After USC defensive end Aaron Williams stripped the ball from
quarterback Brian Russell and recovered the loose ball at the San
Diego State 33-yard line, Soward again put the ball in the end zone
for the Trojans.
</P>
<P>
   The junior wide receiver caught an 8-yard touchdown pass from
Mike Van Raaphorst that gave the Trojans a 21-0 advantage.
</P>
<P>
   And just when USC had fallen into a second-half malaise, Soward
came to the rescue in the third quarter. He caught a pass behind
the line of scrimmage, and raced 42 yards before being tackled at
the San Diego State 38-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   Soward also shook things up early by taking a short pass and
sprinting 35 yards into the end zone on his first possession, but
the play was called back for holding.
</P>
<P>
   These big plays were more than enough, however, to prove that
Soward can have more impact than any other USC player on the field.
In fact, he was just about the only Trojan to do anything
offensively against the Aztecs.
</P>
<P>
   USC's kicking game, which was near perfect against Purdue, had a
less-than-stellar evening. The Trojans' opening drive stalled and
kicker Adam Abrams missed a 39-yard field goal to snap his string
of 12 straight field goals.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the quarter, Abrams missed a 29-yard attempt, which no
doubt caused some to think back to his struggles the previous two
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   That feeling was reinforced when Abrams missed a 44-yard attempt
in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The first half was a slightly better story for the offense. The
Trojans managed to score a touchdown on their second possession of
the game, driving 66 yards in seven plays. Soward ran 16 yards on a
handoff while Van Raaphorst completed passes to Windrell Hayes (12
yards) and Larry Parker (16 yards).
</P>
<P>
   Morton scored on a 12-yard run to give the Trojans a 7-0 lead,
USC's only points of the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Despite rolling up impressive totals statistically, it took
awhile for the Trojans to convert those gaudy numbers into a
substantial lead.
</P>
<P>
   USC outgained San Diego State in first-half yardage, 302-105,
but only managed a 21-6 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Aztecs ended notions of an early blowout, when Russell hit
Damon Gourdine on a 31-yard touchdown pass with 1:01 left in the
half.
</P>
<P>
   Van Raaphorst had a solid game, completing 13 of 26 passes for
189 yards and two touchdowns. Freshman Carson Palmer entered the
game in the third quarter and completed 5 of 8 passes for 50 yards
and a touchdown. He also threw his first interception.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: USC wide receiver Billy Miller caught a pass for the 13th
consecutive game.... San Diego State cornerback Tairou Smith was
ejected in the first quarter for a personal foul.

PADRES BEAT DODGERS, CLINCH WEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(OPTIONAL: Adds quotes, details) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ The San Diego Padres had 60,823 reasons to clinch
the NL West on Saturday night and for once none of them had to do
with the Los Angeles Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   The way the Padres dismantled the Dodgers 8-7 after trailing by
seven runs had nothing to do with a rivalry that definitely took
this year off. It was just the truest mark of a champion. The
Padres just never gave up.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shows the heart and determination we've had all year,''
said slugger Greg Vaughn. ``This is awesome, but it is just the
first step.''
</P>
<P>
   In front of the second largest crowd ever to see a game in the
30-year history of Jack Murphy and now Qualcomm Stadium, the Padres
scored three runs in the fifth and five in the sixth to win their
second division title in three years.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres also won the West in 1996 when they overtook the
Dodgers on the season's final weekend. They were eliminated in the
first round, but this year, they have been dominating since Opening
Day and hope to go a lot further.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers, who are now 19 games out with 13 to play, never
challenged this year. Perhaps fittingly, the Padres won on the same
field where the Dodgers clinched the West in 1988. That was the
year they won the World Series and the last time they won a playoff
game.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it was Padres closer Trevor Hoffman, brother of
Dodgers manager Glenn Hoffman, striking out Matt Luke to record his
49th save. Luke drove in the Dodgers' first five runs, but now the
Padres were running on the field to celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was very tough to watch,'' Glenn Hoffman said. ``That's
where we want to be. Out on the field celebrating.''
</P>
<P>
   As for his emotions watching his brother put his team away to
clinch the division title, Hoffman refused to comment. But Hoffman
also knows that the Padres finished last in the West a year ago.
But with all the changes coming this winter, there is no guarantee
he'll be back.
</P>
<P>
   There's some uncertainty here as well. The Padres are trying to
get voters to approve construction of a new stadium on the November
ballot. They also face losing top free agents Kevin Brown and Ken
Caminiti. Saturday certainly was a ringing endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am so proud of these guys, I can't tell you,'' said former
Dodger Dave Stewart, now the Padres pitching coach. ``Every day
they came to play. This is the proof.''
</P>
<P>
   For San Diego, it was the 52nd home victory, the best in the
National League and only one fewer than the New York Yankees'
major-league high.
</P>
<P>
   And all this without eight-time batting champion Tony Gwynn, who
is sidelined with wrist and Achilles injuries. Gwynn was all over
the ballpark, however. The Padres distributed Tony Gwynn T-shirts
to the crowd, and the packed house was a sea of white.
</P>
<P>
   For the Dodgers, Saturday's loss was typical in many ways, but
also the worst of the season. Their previous worst game was July 23
when they blew a 6-0 lead to Houston and lost 8-6.
</P>
<P>
   Luke, playing left field, appeared to give Dodgers starter Dave
Mlicki (8-8) all he needed by driving in five runs in the first
three innings. Eric Karros added a two-run homer in the fifth off
Padres starter Stan Spencer, who was making just his fourth
major-league start.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talk about highs and lows,'' Luke said. ``It felt so great
early in the game. But that's baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   On Mars, maybe.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Mlicki entered the fifth having faced just one batter over
the minimum. Things still looked fine when Wally Joyner opened the
inning with his 12th homer. But when Greg Myers followed with a
single and Andy Sheets reached base on a fielding error by third
baseman Adrian Beltre, the mood changed.
</P>
<P>
   Beltre had just entered the game as a defensive replacement for
Bobby Bonilla.
</P>
<P>
   Mlicki then gave up a two-run double to Chris Gomez, cutting the
Dodgers' lead to 7-3.
</P>
<P>
   Mlicki, who entered the game 7-3 in 17 starts since joining the
Dodgers on June 4, just fell apart. And with a bullpen that now
features rookies Sean Maloney and Jeff Kubenka after injuries to
Antonio Osuna and Mark Guthrie, there was little to stop the
madness.
</P>
<P>
   In all, those three walked five batters in the sixth when San
Diego took the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't throw a strike,'' Hoffman said. ``You don't beat a
team like this doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Mlicki opened the sixth by allowing a single to Vaughn then
walked the next three batters, including Myers with the bases
loaded. He was replaced by Maloney, who hit his first batter,
Sheets, then walked Gomez.
</P>
<P>
   Kubenka allowed a sac fly to pinch hitter Quilvio Veras that
tied the game at seven. Kubenka, who recorded his first
major-league victory Tuesday in Arizona, retired Steve Finley, but
walked Mark Sweeney.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn was the 10th batter of the inning, and he gave the Padres
the lead with an RBI single to left. But Luke threw out Gomez at
the plate to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers still had three innings to tie the game, but it
never happened.
</P>
<P>
   They had runners at first and third with one out in the seventh,
but didn't score. Former longtime Angels left-hander Mark Langston
came in to face Luke. It was Langston's first relief appearance
since October 1986 _ a span of 331 consecutive starts _ when he
pitched for Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Luke hit a sharp grounder to first off the glove of Joyner, but
Sheets picked up the ball at second and threw to Langston covering
for the out.
</P>
<P>
   Luke was the only batter for Langston, who will be working out
of the bullpen in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Miceli replaced Langston and struck out Mark Grudzielanek,
leaving the go-ahead runs on base.

COUGARS DROP SUN DEVILS TO 0-2 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVO, Utah _ OK. Ha, ha. Very funny. Where is it? Who hid
Arizona State's offense?
</P>
<P>
   Because the group that showed up at Cougar Stadium Saturday
night ``certainly'' couldn't have been the one that looked so
dangerous a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about total meltdown. The No. 14 Sun Devils mustered just
22 rushing yards against Brigham Young and were humiliated, 26-6,
in front of 65,096 and a national television audience.
</P>
<P>
   Ouch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the loss that hurts,'' tailback J.R. Redmond said.
``It's that we know we're a better team.''
</P>
<P>
   So much for a national title, a Heisman Trophy and maybe a major
bowl. ASU struggled so much that North Texas, next week's opponent,
is suddenly looking a lot more formidable.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils start 0-2 for the first time since 1979, Frank
Kush's last season.
</P>
<P>
   Redmond, a Heisman hopeful, was held to 28 yards. Quarterback
Ryan Kealy completed 16 of 34 pass attempts. ASU receivers dropped
numerous passes. The Sun Devils committed 11 penalties for 105
yards. Mike Gauthier missed field goal attempts of 44 and 30 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Other than that . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``We struggled to get J.R. the ball,'' ASU Coach Bruce Snyder
said. ``We dropped some balls. We misread some defenses, in terms
of where to go with the ball. They just outplayed us.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory was BYU's second straight over ASU.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Sun Devils made a star of BYU tailback Ronney
Jenkins, who rushed for 171 yards and one touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ASU returned home Saturday night with several significant
questions to answer:
</P>
<P>
   How can an offense with so many weapons be so ineffective?
</P>
<P>
   While Kealy was sharp at times, he also appeared to lack the
touch that has been his forte.
</P>
<P>
   Too many receivers dropped passes. The group has been called one
of the deepest in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Redmond's longest run was seven yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``The front four they've got is big,'' center Grey Ruegamer
said. ``They played very well and we played like (expletive).''
</P>
<P>
   What's the next move for the kicking game?
</P>
<P>
   Gauthier missed two field goals after making one of two in last
week's opener against Washington. The Sun Devils may have to take a
closer look at punter Stephen Baker.
</P>
<P>
   Can the team overcome this emotional hurdle?
</P>
<P>
   Snyder said it took his team nearly four days to get over the
season-opening loss to Washington. How long will it take the
players to get over this? Two of ASU's next four games are against
Southern California and Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me say this,'' Snyder said. ``I still believe in this team
and I told them that at the half and at the end of the game. . . .
We can still have an awfully good season.''
</P>
<P>
   Is the defense good enough to allow for offensive lapses?
</P>
<P>
   Snyder already has this answer. No. While the unit played better
than it did against the Huskies, this is still a young group that
needs more game experience.
</P>
<P>
   Why do the Sun Devils continue to commit so many penalties?
</P>
<P>
   While many of the later flags were products of frustration, they
added up. ASU has been one of the Pac-10's most penalized teams in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Credit must go to BYU, who rebounded from a season-opening loss
to Alabama to put an impressive defense on the field. ASU's only
score was a 15-yard pass from Kealy to Lenzie Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew we were going to play well tonight because we had such
a great practice,'' Cougars Coach LaVell Edwards said. ``It was one
of the best weeks we've had around here. I didn't know tonight's
game would go quite like it did, but we were very pleased.''
</P>
<P>
   ASU's offense appeared out of sync early.
</P>
<P>
   Kealy overthrew Tariq McDonald. Several receivers dropped
catchable passes. Redmond couldn't find a hole if his life depended
on it. Fortunately, it didn't.
</P>
<P>
   The Cougars were a bit more effective, and scored the only
points of the first quarter on a 34-yard field goal by Owen Pochman
with 10:19 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Pochman made all four field goals he tried.
</P>
<P>
   BYU came out in a variety of formations to try to keep the Sun
Devils off balance. ASU substituted freely, and by early in the
second quarter, had played eight defensive linemen.
</P>
<P>
   The Cougars increased their lead to 10-0 on a 74-yard scoring
play from Kevin Feterik to Ben Horton. Feterik's pass was tipped by
cornerback J'Juan Cherry before Horton grabbed it, juked several
ASU defenders and ran into the end zone. &QL;

BACKUP QB JOB ELLIOTT'S, IT APPEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVO, Utah _  &UR; Chad Elliott appears to have won the backup
quarterback job for Arizona State.
</P>
<P>
   The sophomore replaced  &UR; Ryan Kealy late in the fourth quarter
against Brigham Young on Saturday night. He was 4 of 7 for 45
yards. Starter Kealy was 16 of 34 for 241 yards, one touchdown and
one interception.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott was battling senior  &UR; Steve Campbell for the role. ASU
Coach
 &UR; Bruce Snyder said after Camp Tontozona that the competition was
even. They are both listed on the depth chart as No. 2. &QL; 
Versatile J.R. &QL; 
 &UR; J.R. Redmond made his first appearance on defense of the season
with 10:30 remaining in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   His appearances on that side of the ball were limited the rest
of the game. The Sun Devils needed him more as a tailback and punt
returner, although he didn't have much success in either area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I felt I played OK,'' Redmond said. ``I can't
speak for the rest of the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really can't talk much about this game until we look at
film and figure out what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Redmond's three punt returns resulted in just eight yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have one of the great threats in J.R. Redmond, and I
thought we did a great job to stop them,'' BYU Coach  &UR; LaVell
Edwards said. &QL; 
Tough break &QL; 
ASU guard  &UR; Randy Leaphart injured his right knee in the first
quarter and didn't play the remainder of the game.
</P>
<P>
   He will undergo further tests today. &QL; 
Will, but no way &QL; 
 &UR; Will Snowden, the Cougars' leading rusher in their opener against
Alabama, was kept out of the game with a pulled hamstring. &QL; 
Injured Cougar &QL; 
BYU starting linebacker  &UR; Brad Martin was involved in a traffic
accident Friday afternoon while drive to practice at Cougar
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   He received a cut on his forehead that required seven stitches
by the team orthopedist. He played Saturday and was a factor in
stopping ASU's running game. &QL; 
Levi blues &QL; 
What is it about ASU players and elevators?
</P>
<P>
   Defensive end  &UR; Levi Jones spend 20 minutes trapped in a hotel
elevator Friday. He rang the bell until hotel personnel helped him.
</P>
<P>
   During NCAA Tournament play last season, several ASU baseball
players were trapped in a hotel elevator for half an hour before a
game. &QL; 
Quick hits &QL; 
Three true freshmen made the trip: tight end  &UR; Todd Heap,
linebacker &UR; Alfred Williams and defensive back  &UR; William Daniel.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils are now 6-2 in games following a loss in the same
season.
</P>
<P>
   Utah encountered some of its strangest weather in years
Saturday. A tornado, rare in these parts, was spotted north of Salt
Lake. Hail hit Provo and blanketed Cougar Stadium several hours
before the game. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils have won 10 of their past 12 road games.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about pressure. During an appearance on CNN's ``Larry
King'' ``Live'' this week, LDS Church President  &UR; Gordon B. Hinckley
said he'd like to see BYU's football team have a better season than
last year's 6-5 record. &QL;

This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-To,

   &UR; ALL OVER BUT THE SHOUTIN' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Rick Bragg. Vintage, $14.
</P>
<P>
   A child of ``white trash'' America tells of how he escaped his
dirt-poor Alabama upbringing to become a Pulitzer Prize-winning
correspondent for The New York Times, a journey made possible in
large part by the sacrifice and suffering of his formidable mother.
Last year our reviewer, Anthony Walton, called this a ``sad,
beautiful, funny and moving memoir.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LARRY'S PARTY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Carol Shields. Penguin, $12.95.
</P>
<P>
   Focusing in minute detail on the inner life of Larry Weller, a
thoughtful Canadian landscape designer whose passion is building
garden mazes, this affectionate novel seeks to define what it's
like being a man in the '90s. The labyrinth of Larry's existence is
revealed gradually: his childhood, his elusive and complicated
romantic entanglements, his friends and family, above all his
unflinching dialogue with his ``self's silver mirror.'' By the end,
``the reader could not feel closer to Larry Weller or more
benevolently disposed toward him, a measure of his creator's
generosity,'' Verlyn Klinkenborg wrote in the Book Review in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE DARK SIDE OF CAMELOT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Seymour M. Hersh. Back Bay/Little, Brown, $15.
</P>
<P>
   A renowned investigative reporter trots out nearly every report,
claim or rumor of nasty goings-on by John F. Kennedy and his
coterie. Even if the author's scattershot approach has mixed
results, ``he makes life difficult for historians by digging up
just enough about distressing matters so they can't honestly be
ignored,'' Thomas Powers said here last year. In  &UR; THE KENNEDY
TAPES: INSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE DURING THE CUBAN MISSILE CRISIS &LR; ,
edited by Ernest R. May and Philip D. Zelikow (Belknap/Harvard
University, $16.95), the president emerges as a highly skeptical
dove when the world was on the brink of nuclear war, and seems
Lincolnesque in his grim resolve. In 1997 our reviewer, Barry
Gewen, called this scholarly transcription, which includes
connecting text and explanatory passages, ``a splendid
achievement.'' The Cuban missile crisis is also the subject of  &UR; ONE
HELL OF A GAMBLE: KHRUSHCHEV, CASTRO, AND KENNEDY, 1958-1964 &LR; , by
Aleksandr Fursenko and Timothy Naftali (Norton, $14.95), in which
two historians, one Russian and one American, draw on archival
material from official Soviet sources to provide a fresh
perspective on the drama. ``The story takes on the elements of
great theater as it moves to its denouement,'' John Newhouse wrote
in these pages last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE FORTUNATE PILGRIM &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Mario Puzo. Fawcett Columbine, $12.95.
</P>
<P>
   Before Don Corleone there was Lucia Santa, a cunning,
tough-as-nails matriarch who raises six children by herself in
Hell's Kitchen. This fictional chronicle of immigrant life by the
author of  &UR; THE GODFATHER &LR;  is ``lifted into literature by ... its
penetrating insights and its mixture of tenderness and rage,''
David Boroff said here in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE BEGINNING OF SPRING &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Penelope Fitzgerald. Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $12.
</P>
<P>
   This comedy of manners, set in Russia in 1913, revolves around a
self-effacing British printer who scrambles to find someone to care
for his three children after his wife bails out and returns home.
``It is a lovely novel,'' Robert Plunket wrote here in 1989, with a
colorful cast of flaky expats and exuberant locals. The same
publisher has reissued an earlier novel by the author,  &UR; INNOCENCE &LR; 
($12), in which a guileless woman from an aristocratic Florentine
family summons an English girlfriend to help her win the heart of a
neurologist. ``Fitzgerald casts a wry, forgiving eye on her
characters and charms us,'' our reviewer, Emily Leider, said in
1987.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A COMMOTION IN THE BLOOD: LIFE, DEATH, AND THE IMMUNE SYSTEM &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Stephen S. Hall. Owl/Holt, $16.95.
</P>
<P>
   The author, a contributing writer and editor at The New York
Times Magazine, argues that the history of immunotherapy in the war
against cancer has been a messy, up-and-down affair that is
fascinating even if there isn't a ``magic bullet'' in sight. The
result is a ``masterly study,'' Roy Porter wrote here last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HOCKEY SUR GLACE: STORIES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Peter LaSalle. Breakaway/Lyons Press, $13.
</P>
<P>
   These seven stories and four poems are marked by a deep
affection for the hockey of mill towns and pickup games played on
pond ice by older skaters with young hearts. The tales ``all take
weight from a powerful retrospect, from lost times that were both
troubled and blessed,'' Ron Carlson wrote in these pages last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; RACHEL CARSON: WITNESS FOR NATURE  &LR;  By Linda Lear. Owl/Holt,
$17.95.
</P>
<P>
   This biography reveals how the largely self-taught author of
 &UR; SILENT SPRING &LR;  contributed so much to the postwar environmental
movement and had such a strong influence on American sensibilities.
This is ``the most exhaustive account so far of Carson's private,
professional and public lives,'' Robert B. Semple Jr. said here in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE BACON FANCIER: FOUR TALES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Alan Isler. Penguin, $11.95.
</P>
<P>
   Each of these novellas is set in a different century and locale,
from 17th-century Venice to latter-day Manhattan, but they are
linked by mistrustful Jewish protagonists struggling with pride in
a gentile world. Last year our reviewer, James Saynor, called this
a ``clever and radiant work.''

   THE CLINTON CRISIS
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-PUBLIC _ WASHINGTON _ As they decide whether to proceed
with impeachment, a deeply political process, House members are
waiting for the American public's verdict on President Clinton. How
is that verdict shaping up now that people have had a full day to
assess the report? What are the main themes of public reaction?

   ISRAEL-DEADLOCKED-1STLEDE-$ADV13 _ (Corrects reported number of
Palestinian deaths since the Oslo Accords.) ITZHAR, West Bank _
Amid the olive orchards and goat herds fields on this hillside,
Arabs and Jews are filling the void caused by stalled peace talks
with aggressive moves aimed at getting an edge for an uncertain
future. Two Jewish settlers were killed here recently in an ambush
laid, presumably, by Palestinians. Already worried that they will
literally lose ground in future concessions, the settlers responded
with 15 new homes in the occupied territory, just the kind of move
that American diplomats and Palestinians warn will destroy what is
left of the peace process. (Kaplow, Cox News Service).

   MEXICO-CORRUPTION-$ADV13 _ MORELOS, Mexico _ In some cases,
entire families have been kidnapped and held for ransom during
Mexico's recent crime plague. Almost everyone has a tale to tell
about being robbed or assaulted. But it's high-level corruption
among law officials and political figures _ as much as common
criminals _ who many blame for Mexico's struggle with injustice
these days. Corruption is spotlighted in news reports that are more
aggressive than they once were, and popular citizens' movements
have had some success in driving allegedly corrupt political
figures out of office _ achievements once unheard of in Mexico. But
every day, it seems, there are new reports of suspected acts of
corruption that are testing public patience. Police are arrested
for rape and kidnapping; a former Mexico City transportation
director is arrested for misuse of funds; bankers are reviled for
helping themselves to bad loans and then expecting the public
treasury to bail them out. Is corruption getting worse, or it
simply being exposed more? (Ferriss, Cox News Service).

   With CORRUPTION-POLLS-$ADV13 _ MEXICO CITY _ Poll data on how
Mexicans feel about how their government is dealing with
corruption. (Ferriss, Cox News Service). WITH PHOTOS.

   JAMAICA-BIRDWATCHING-$ADV12 _ MONTEGO BAY, Jamaica _ Sure,
Jamaica's known for its stunning beaches and plush resorts, but
being near the water and sipping margaritas aren't all there is to
do in this popular Caribbean country. Birdwatching, for example, is
attracting a growing number of travelers. And, Jamaica boasts one
of the Caribbean's most unique attractions: the Rocklands Feeding
Station in the village of Anchovy, just a short drive from Montego
Bay. At the station, home to 93-year-old ornithologist Lisa Salmon,
visitors can feed all sorts of wild birds from the palms of their
hands. Visitors can also hunt for butterflies _ Jamaica is home to
the largest butterfly in the Americas. So, you don't have to go to
Jamaica just for the water. (Emling, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   With JAMAICA-BOX-$ADV12 _ If you go. (Emling, Cox News Service).
WITH PHOTOS.
</P>
<P>
   CARIBBEAN-CRIME-$ADV12 _ PARADISE ISLAND, Bahamas _ It's called
paradise, but this island is having a hard time living up to its
name. In the past two weeks, three foreigners have been murdered
here, including a young American school teacher. The latest murder
occured on Sept. 2 when a man who worked on Carnival Cruise Line's
Fantasy ship was shot to death during a robbery. No one's been
accused of the crimes and so, according to the headlines, there's a
``Killer On The Loose.'' But the Bahamas is not only plagued by
rising crime, it's also awash with drugs, mostly cocaine. During
the first three months of 1998, officials seized more cocaine than
in the previous three years combined. All this hardly bodes well
for the reputation of the Bahamas, or for the winter months, the
biggest season for tourists in the Caribbean. The Bahamian islands
host 3 million tourists each year, and rely on tourists for 70
percent of their income. (Emling, Cox News Service).

   MOUNT-VERNON _ MOUNT VERNON, Va. _ Nearly 200 years after George
Washington died in an upstairs bedroom of his beloved plantation
overlooking the Potomac River, his house is getting
air-conditioning. That's cool with most folks. Millions of summer
visitors have sweated through tours of the carefully preserved home
of the nation's first president, and electric fans are needed to
keep guides from fainting in the stifling heat. But a few
preservationists are downright hot over the decision of Mount
Vernon's governing board to install a $1 million computerized
climate control system in one of America's most historic homes.

<P>
   ARGENTINA-ECON (Buenos Aires) _ It has become almost a daily
ritual. President Carlos Saul Menem and his chief economic advisers
take every opportunity to promise they will not retreat from the
government's fixed exchange rate that pegs the value of the
Argentine peso to the American dollar one to one. Such
pronouncements have often preceded huge devaluations in Latin
America. But most Argentine economists and Wall Street analysts are
taking Menem at his word, at least for now, despite concerns that
the currency peg could push up interest rates and unemployment. By

   PAPER-MAKER (Cicinnati) _ There was a time when it was thought

   THE CLINTON CRISIS
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-PUBLIC _ WASHINGTON _ As they decide whether to proceed
with impeachment, a deeply political process, House members are
waiting for the American public's verdict on President Clinton. How
is that verdict shaping up now that people have had a full day to
assess the report? What are the main themes of public reaction?
(Dart, Cox News Service).

and other pastors around the nation are saying about the Lewinsky
scandal. (Shepard, Cox News Service).
</P>

   CLINTON-LEGISLATION _ WASHINGTON _ With President Clinton
potentially weakened by the Starr report, the Republican-led
Congress is preparing to press legislation he opposes in the final
weeks of the 105th Congress. What bills will Clinton be sent, and
will his problems make him more or less likely to resist them?
(Mollison, Cox News Service).

   INTERNATIONAL
</P>
<P>
   ISRAEL-DEADLOCKED-1STLEDE-$ADV13 _ (Corrects reported number of
Palestinian deaths since the Oslo Accords.) ITZHAR, West Bank _
Amid the olive orchards and goat herds fields on this hillside,
Arabs and Jews are filling the void caused by stalled peace talks
with aggressive moves aimed at getting an edge for an uncertain
future. Two Jewish settlers were killed here recently in an ambush
laid, presumably, by Palestinians. Already worried that they will
literally lose ground in future concessions, the settlers responded
with 15 new homes in the occupied territory, just the kind of move
that American diplomats and Palestinians warn will destroy what is
left of the peace process. (Kaplow, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   With ISRAEL-SECURITY-$ADV13 _ JERUSALEM _ Budget line to come.
(Kaplow, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   With DEADLOCKED-CHRONO-$ADV13 _ JERUSALEM _ A chrono box showing

months. (Kaplow, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   WITH PHOTOS AND GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO-CORRUPTION-$ADV13 _ MORELOS, Mexico _ In some cases,
entire families have been kidnapped and held for ransom during
Mexico's recent crime plague. Almost everyone has a tale to tell
about being robbed or assaulted. But it's high-level corruption
among law officials and political figures _ as much as common
criminals _ who many blame for Mexico's struggle with injustice
these days. Corruption is spotlighted in news reports that are more
aggressive than they once were, and popular citizens' movements
have had some success in driving allegedly corrupt political
figures out of office _ achievements once unheard of in Mexico. But
every day, it seems, there are new reports of suspected acts of
corruption that are testing public patience. Police are arrested
for rape and kidnapping; a former Mexico City transportation
director is arrested for misuse of funds; bankers are reviled for
helping themselves to bad loans and then expecting the public
treasury to bail them out. Is corruption getting worse, or it
simply being exposed more? (Ferriss, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   With CORRUPTION-POLLS-$ADV13 _ MEXICO CITY _ Poll data on how
Mexicans feel about how their government is dealing with
corruption. (Ferriss, Cox News Service). WITH PHOTOS.
</P>
<P>
   JAMAICA-BIRDWATCHING-$ADV12 _ MONTEGO BAY, Jamaica _ Sure,
Jamaica's known for its stunning beaches and plush resorts, but
being near the water and sipping margaritas aren't all there is to
do in this popular Caribbean country. Birdwatching, for example, is
attracting a growing number of travelers. And, Jamaica boasts one
of the Caribbean's most unique attractions: the Rocklands Feeding
Station in the village of Anchovy, just a short drive from Montego
Bay. At the station, home to 93-year-old ornithologist Lisa Salmon,
visitors can feed all sorts of wild birds from the palms of their
hands. Visitors can also hunt for butterflies _ Jamaica is home to
the largest butterfly in the Americas. So, you don't have to go to
Jamaica just for the water. (Emling, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   With JAMAICA-BOX-$ADV12 _ If you go. (Emling, Cox News Service).
WITH PHOTOS.
</P>
<P>
   CARIBBEAN-CRIME-$ADV12 _ PARADISE ISLAND, Bahamas _ It's called
paradise, but this island is having a hard time living up to its
name. In the past two weeks, three foreigners have been murdered
here, including a young American school teacher. The latest murder
occured on Sept. 2 when a man who worked on Carnival Cruise Line's
Fantasy ship was shot to death during a robbery. No one's been
accused of the crimes and so, according to the headlines, there's a
``Killer On The Loose.'' But the Bahamas is not only plagued by
rising crime, it's also awash with drugs, mostly cocaine. During
the first three months of 1998, officials seized more cocaine than
in the previous three years combined. All this hardly bodes well
for the reputation of the Bahamas, or for the winter months, the
biggest season for tourists in the Caribbean. The Bahamian islands
host 3 million tourists each year, and rely on tourists for 70
percent of their income. (Emling, Cox News Service).

   MOUNT-VERNON _ MOUNT VERNON, Va. _ Nearly 200 years after George
Washington died in an upstairs bedroom of his beloved plantation
overlooking the Potomac River, his house is getting
air-conditioning. That's cool with most folks. Millions of summer
visitors have sweated through tours of the carefully preserved home
of the nation's first president, and electric fans are needed to
keep guides from fainting in the stifling heat. But a few
preservationists are downright hot over the decision of Mount
Vernon's governing board to install a $1 million computerized
climate control system in one of America's most historic homes.

 &HT;    600&AMP;adds.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Public opinion will weigh heavily as Congress
decides whether President Clinton should remain in office, but
polls won't matter much for a while and may not be the key factor,
politicians and campaign consultants said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Polling conducted since Friday, when Independent Counsel Kenneth
Starr released his report, is statistically suspect, the experts
agreed. And opinions could shift dramatically in the weeks or
months before the House Judiciary Committee may hold hearings on
the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm flabbergasted listening to people on television talking
about how America has responded and what America has concluded''
about the Starr report, said Harrison Hickman, a Democratic
campaign consultant. ``That process has only just begun.''
</P>
<P>
   Several surveys released Sunday showed that most Americans still
think Clinton is doing a good job and want him censured by Congress
rather than removed from office.
</P>
<P>
   The polls showed a majority of Americans _ ranging from 59
percent to 67 percent _ approved of the way Clinton was performing
his duties as president.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, a majority in three polls taken over the weekend and
released Sunday _ for ABC News, CBS News and CNN/USA Today/Gallup _
said they thought the president should remain in office, the
Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
   But more people had an unfavorable opinion of Clinton personally
than had a favorable one, and a majorities said they wanted
Congress to punish the president in some way. A majority in the CBS
News poll, 56 percent, and in the CNN poll, 59 percent, said they
favored censure by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   However, these initial findings may not hold up, polling experts
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If instant polls showed a plummet in Clinton's support, it
would be significant,'' said Andrew Kohut, director of the
nonpartisan Pew Research Center. ``But if they show no change, that
does not mean there won't be change.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans ``certainly shouldn't be looking at any of the polls
coming out over the weekend,'' cautioned Hickman, the Democratic
consultant. ``The weekend is a terrible time to poll under any
circumstances. There is not a representative sample of Americans at
home on weekends. And the overwhelming majority of interviews of
this unrepresentative sample'' have not learned enough about report
and the president's response to form a lasting opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Even when Americans have considered the evidence and made up
their minds, there is a limit to how important public opinion will
be in the final judgment of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we need polls,'' Rep. John Conyers of Michigan,
the ranking Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, said Sunday
on CNN's ``Late Edition'' program. ``I don't think we need to
measure how people feel. We have a constitutional duty that should
rise above that. And I think that we'll be able to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Poll figures won't tip the balance for most members, agreed Rep.
John Boehner, R-Ohio, chairman of the House Republican Conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that from a member's perspective, that's a
consideration at all,'' said Boehner. ``Members are going to vote
how they believe their constitutional responsibilities require and
not by what their constituents think of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrison Hickman, a pollster for Democratic candidates, agreed,
noting that the majority of House incumbents in both political
parties have safe seats and he expects they will use their own
judgment in the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of those times where being slavish to polls is
especially ill-advised,'' he said. ``'Frankly, I'd be shocked if
one of my clients even asks me to poll on that.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, the polls are being closely followed on Capitol Hill and
at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   With Congress preparing to decide whether to formally begin an
impeachment proceeding, ``where we go from here is not legalistic
but political,'' said Kohut. ``The opinions of normal Americans''
will be considered in the actions of their elected representatives.
</P>
<P>
   In this public arena, the questions will focus on broader
grounds than the legal definitions of perjury or obstruction of
justice, political observers predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The case for the American public, since the impeachment is a
political matter, has to do with their view of the leader of this
country. Is he the person who should lead the country? Is he the
person who should deal with other nations? Is he the person who
should show an example to the children of this country?'' said
White House correspondent Sam Donaldson on ABC's ``This Week'' news
program. ``I think the people will make that judgment and their
elected representatives will reflect it, whatever it may be.''
</P>
<P>
   Kohut said poll readers should watch several indicators for
change in public opinion:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The president's job approval rating.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Whether people think he should resign.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Whether they think the charges are serious enough that the
president should be impeached.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Whether Clinton has the moral authority and respect of the
public and of other leaders to continue in office.
</P>
<P>
   ``In most polls, it will take a while for the impact'' of the
Starr report to be accurately gauged on these key questions, Kohut
said. ``And look for signs of a backlash, that respondents are
angry with Starr'' for the graphic depictions of sex in the report.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Another poll that could have bearing on what happens to Clinton
is the generic survey of voting intentions _ whether respondents
intend to vote for a Democrat or Republican in the upcoming
congressional elections, said Kohut. ``Now it's very close, with
the Republicans having a small lead,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If this gap widens in favor of the GOP, he said, Democrats in
swing districts ``will want to distance themselves further from the
president.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress will have weeks, if not months, to study
these polls before having to cast any risky votes on the issue,
however. Even Democratic supporters of the president say that
Starr's report will probably lead to an impeachment inquiry by the
Judiciary Committee _ which would liely mean hearings beginning
after the November congressional elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would be very likely that the next Congress will
ultimately be the body that will consider most of the evidence that
the Judiciary Committee may, in the interim, be looking at in much
greater detail,'' Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Calif., said in a television
interview.

PATENTS: SOLVING COMPUTING PROBLEMS WITH DNA; REDUCING STRESS FOR
LAWN ENTHUSIASTS; DOORSTOP HOLDERS FOR DELIVERY MEN; DETECTING LATE
BETS IN ROULETTE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., N.J., Ill., Fla.)  (lb) 
 By TERESA RIORDAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Four years ago, Dr. Leonard Adleman raised the exciting
possibility of DNA-powered supercomputers when he wrote in the
journal Science that he had solved a computational problem
essentially by stirring up some DNA in a test tube, using building
blocks of DNA as computing symbols.
</P>
<P>
   The technique, in concept, involves the use of DNA _ strands of
genetic code _ as a stand-in for computer software code.
</P>
<P>
   Adleman, a professor at the University of Southern California,
set up his problem by synthesizing DNA in a certain sequence and
then letting DNA molecules react in a test tube so they ultimately
produce a molecule whose sequence is the answer to the problem.
</P>
<P>
   He used the chemical units of DNA rather than electronic 1s and
0s to solve a single, relatively simple problem: figuring out the
shortest distance someone would have to travel to visit a number of
different cities _ similar to a standard math problem referred to
as the ``traveling salesman tour problem.''
</P>
<P>
   But last week Dr. Warren Smith and Dr. Allan Schweitzer, two
scientists at the NEC Research Institute in Princeton, N.J.,
received what appears to be the first patent covering a DNA
computing process that at least theoretically can solve not just a
single problem but a broad array of problems, just as a
conventional desktop computer might.
</P>
<P>
   The patent describes a way to concoct a vat of DNA molecules
that have been manipulated by standard biotechnology techniques _
such as the cutting, splicing and growing of DNA strands _ to
behave like miniature computers.
</P>
<P>
   All these molecular-size computers would operate in parallel,
with each one exploring different possible computational paths to
solve a problem, potentially speeding up computing time greatly.
</P>
<P>
   The patent details a way to use genetic material to construct a
large number of what are called Turing machines, all running in
parallel, with each exploring different possible computational
paths. (A Turing machine is a theoretical construct, first proposed
in 1937 by the British computer scientist Alan Turing, that
provides the schematic outline upon which digital computers are
based.)
</P>
<P>
   Despite the new patent, Smith does not sound optimistic these
days about the patented technique.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the DNA molecules do the right step,'' he said in an
interview, describing the process. ``But then some other fraction
just dissolve and get flushed down the drain.''
</P>
<P>
   This and other problems lead to an exponential buildup in errors
during the calculations. In addition, the operations of this DNA
computing so far are slow-going, taking hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``This does appear to be the first patent to issue in this
area,'' said David Waltz, an NEC vice president. ``But will this be
the basis of a new industry, and will everyone have to take out a
license on it in the future? That's not so clear.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith and Schweitzer received patent number 5,804,373.
</P>
<P>
   A Tool to Reduce Stress for Lawn Enthusiasts
</P>
<P>
   Many homeowners devote September to that most Sisyphean of
suburban tasks: preparing the foundation for a lush, weed-free
lawn.
</P>
<P>
   William M. Miller, a railroad worker in Evergreen Park, Ill.,
has patented a device that he says will make things easier on the
handler and on growing grass. It is a single ``lawn-renovating
tool'' that can be used to mulch, de-thatch, seed, fertilize and
even aerate the lawn.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's 20-pound tool looks somewhat like a drop spreader with
spikes at the bottom. And it has a long handle _ about the length
of a typical rake handle _ which provides leverage to make pushing
the spikes through the ground easier, according to Miller.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just like pushing a baby carriage,'' he said. ``If you
want to loosen thatch, you just rake it back.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who is seeking to license his invention, received patent
number 5,787,990.
</P>
<P>
   For the Delivery Man, a Doorstop Holder
</P>
<P>
   Self-closing doors are the bane of delivery drivers, says Joe
Gasperino, of Merritt Island, Fla., who has been a driver for about
10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Gasperino has patented a special holder for doorstops. ``The
holder snaps onto the middle piece of a hand truck,'' he said. ``It
will fit any hand truck.''
</P>
<P>
   The doorstops themselves are small triangles made of rubber or
plastic, he said. But why do you need a special holder for the
doorstops? Can't the driver just keep a doorstop in his back
pocket?
</P>
<P>
   ``That gets really uncomfortable when you have to go back and
sit down in your truck to drive to the next delivery,'' Gasperino
said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had licensed his invention to Magline Co., which
manufactures hand trucks. He received patent number 5,769,437.
</P>
<P>
   Late to Bet, Early to Buzz
</P>
<P>
   Roulette players beware: Two British inventors have patented an
alarm system that sounds when players try to put down late bets.
Their device, which is placed near the roulette wheel, is studded
with infrared sensors that detect any hand motion occurring after
the roulette ball has dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas William George Dean and Kenneth Leslie Hawes, both of
London, received patent number 5,683,084.
</P>
<P>
   Patents are available by number for $3 from the Patent and
Trademark Office, Washington, D.C. 20231.

 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At Novell Inc.'s headquarters in Provo, Utah, in a valley
beneath the Wasatch Mountains, employees like to tease the chief
scientist, Drew Major, for his habit of bringing a portable
computer to meetings and writing software code while others drone
on.
</P>
<P>
   The teasers notwithstanding, Major's habit is one that remains
essential if Novell is to back away from the financial precipice,
where until recently it has found itself isolated in an
increasingly Microsoft-centric computing world.
</P>
<P>
   Major knows that Novell, which once dominated the market for
office personal computer networking software but has lately seemed
in danger of becoming technologically irrelevant, may now have its
best opportunity in years. On Monday it plans to announce the
availability of a new version of its flagship product, Netware, a
month ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The timing is crucial because just last month the Microsoft
Corp. announced that its intended Netware killer _ Windows NT 5.0 _
would not reach the market anytime soon, and analysts are saying
the program may end up arriving next summer or even later, a year
behind schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's slip, coming on the heels of a third-quarter
earnings report by Novell that was better than expected, has buoyed
Major's belief that the company has found a new lease on life and a
new identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were a Microsoft wannabe,'' he said recently during an
interview at the company's corporate campus in Provo. But now, he
said, Novell understands that ``we have to be who we are, and that
is an independent maker of a specialized operating system.''
</P>
<P>
   Major, 48, has already seen both the mountaintop and the valley.
One of the company's first three employees in 1982, he lived and
worked through Novell's phenomenal growth period during the '80s
and then stuck around through the bitter times since the early
'90s, when Ray Noorda, the company's longtime chairman until 1994,
began confronting Microsoft directly with a broad range of
corporate software products _ and failed.
</P>
<P>
   Now Major, the leader of the company's once-demoralized
engineering ranks, contends that Novell has found a way to once
again thrive in Microsoft's long shadow. On a blackboard in a
windowless conference room in the company's headquarters is a long
list of new products designed to make it easier to use the
Internet, which Major contends will give customers renewed reasons
to buy Novell software.
</P>
<P>
   There are already some hopeful signs. After cutting the work
force by 18 percent last year, to 4,600 employees, the company
reported a fiscal third-quarter profit of $27 million last month,
compared with a $122 million loss in the quarter a year earlier.
And test versions of Netware 5.0, the new version of its mainstay
product, have received accolades from trade-press reviewers.
</P>
<P>
   Even better news is that a 15 percent growth in sales of the
existing version of Netware in the most recent quarter suggests
that the computer market is interpreting the Windows NT 5.0 delay
as a signal to renew its commitment to Novell, which lost its
market share advantage over Microsoft last year in the business of
providing software that powers networks of desktop and central
``server'' computers.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts are saying that Microsoft's technology snags,
which they predict could delay the arrival of Windows NT 5.0 until
next summer or later, will give Novell much-needed breathing room _
and an opportunity to consolidate its hold over the 40 million
Netware users.
</P>
<P>
   ``Netware 5.0 is here and Microsoft is not,'' said Steven Dube,
a Wall Street analyst at Wasserstein, Perella &AMP; Co. ``That has
become a major factor.''
</P>
<P>
   If there is a true turnaround, Eric Schmidt, the former Sun
Microsystems technologist who replaced Robert Frankenberg as
Novell's chief executive in April 1997, would no doubt receive and
deserve much of the credit. But a corporate revival would be just
as much the story of the renewed professional passion of Major, who
remains the technological soul of Novell.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the technical ranks of the company, Major still maintains
a reputation as a software engineer who has long emphasized
technical efficiency as the best way to achieve product performance
_ continuously striving to reduce delays between the network and
the hard disk of individual computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drew is all about speed and performance,'' said Kent Prows, a
Novell engineer. ``His legacy is that Netware now offers the
fastest path between the wire and the disk.''
</P>
<P>
   While Microsoft's NT 5.0 has already ballooned to about 45
million lines of code because of Microsoft's effort to make the
program all things to all users, Netware is still less than a
fourth that size. Industry engineers say the size advantage is
almost certain to translate into a speed advantage.
</P>
<P>
   That should help Major and his technical team carry out
Schmidt's strategy _ a plan that goes beyond improving Netware's
performance in office networks by trying to improve the performance
of the entire Internet for corporate customers and Internet service
providers. To supplement Major's team, Schmidt has been quietly
recruiting new talent, much of it reflecting the aggressive,
technology-first Silicon Valley engineering culture embodied by
companies like Sun Microsystems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a little piracy here,'' said Mike Sheridan, who
recently left Sun for Novell, referring to the swashbuckling,
take-no-prisoners attitude affected by the team that developed
Sun's Java Internet programming language under Schmidt.
</P>
<P>
   Sheridan is now leading a small team of Novell programmers who
are building applications for the company's Netware Directory
Services software _ already a highly regarded piece of Netware.
Novell executives have come to consider it the company's most
valuable asset, and they are intent on making it an Internet
standard.
</P>
<P>
   Directory software is the equivalent of electronic white pages,
which enable computer users and other software programs to find
other users, databases and resources in large computer networks.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   While the World Wide Web is vaunted for enabling computer users
to do many of those same tasks, anyone who has used the available
search engines will attest to the need for much greater precision _
especially if the Internet is being used for business and not for
recreation. Novell contends that Netware Directory Services can
meet that need.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our advantage is in the directory space, and no one realizes
how important that advantage is,'' said Prows, the programmer.
</P>
<P>
   And even though Microsoft is known to be adding its own
electronic white pages, called Active Directory, to its next
version of NT, industry reports are already indicating that the
directory does not ``scale up,'' or support a growing number of
users, as well as Novell's. That could be seen as a distinct
drawback to network managers, who may need a directory to scale up
to manage tens of thousands of computers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is not a showdown with Microsoft that Novell is seeking
so much as way to expand into the Internet market in ways that
avoid such a head-on confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt said he still remembered the diplomatic tour of the
industry he took soon after joining Novell and the courtesy call he
made to Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, Wash. ``What should we
do?'' Schmidt recalls asking about Novell's travails.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft executives were politely noncommittal, although
later one of Microsoft's top technical leaders said of the meeting
with Schmidt, ``All I could think of was to give him a gun to shoot
himself.''
</P>
<P>
   But lately, Microsoft seems to be taking Novell more seriously.
Recently in private meetings, Microsoft's president, Steven
Ballmer, has indicated that Novell is now one of the software
giant's most closely watched competitors.
</P>
<P>
   For Major, the issues remind him of the earlier battles that
Novell fought _ and lost _ against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a mindset there of killing everyone who's opposed to
you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, having learned the folly of confronting Microsoft
directly, Major intends to use the vast expanse of the Internet to
step over, under and around his giant rival.

   During the Cold War, while the FBI was investigating the
followers of Karl Marx, it was also focusing its attention on
another Marx, Groucho, an article by a professor at the University
of California says in this week's issue of The Nation.
</P>
<P>
   To write the article, the professor, Jon Wiener, obtained 186
pages of Marx's FBI file, which spans 27 years, under the Freedom
of Information Act. Most of the file, which frequently misspells
``Groucho,'' concerns a copyright lawsuit unrelated to politics,
the article says, and 14 of its pages have been blacked out. But
parts give details of the comedian's activities in left-wing causes
in Hollywood during the 1930s and '40s.
</P>
<P>
   One memorandum to J. Edgar Hoover, the FBI's director, written
in 1953, notes that a member of the Communist Party in San Diego
``recently remarked to a confidential informant that Graucho Marx
contributes heavily to CP.'' But the memorandum also says that a
Los Angeles informant states that ``Marx was never affiliated with
CP.''
</P>
<P>
   Marx's son, Arthur, said his father, who died in 1977 at the age
of 87, had never been a communist. ``He was all his life a
Democrat,'' Marx said. ``He was one of the founders of the Screen
Actors Guild, which was probably one of the reasons for them
looking into his activities.''
</P>
<P>
   The comedian, whose career spanned vaudeville, movies and
television, and who once sang, ``Whatever it is, I'm against it,''
almost never spoke seriously about politics after the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the FBI's own criteria, it was not surprising that Leonard
Bernstein had a file, because he had a party for the Black
Panthers,'' said Victor Navasky, the author of ``Naming Names,'' a
book about the McCarthy period, and The Nation's publisher and
editorial director. ``But a file on Groucho symbolizes the ultimate
absurdity and wastefulness of the FBI's manic pursuit of
communists. One is only sorry that Groucho isn't around to
comment.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the FBI said she could not comment, because
she had not seen the file with blacked-out material provided to
Wiener.
</P>
<P>
   A document in the FBI report quotes remarks it says Marx made to
The Daily Worker, defending the Scottsboro Boys, black men wrongly
convicted of rape in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   The file also notes that Marx attended a benefit in 1942 for
Russian War Relief, opposed recognition of fascist Spain by the
United Nations and belonged to the Committee for the First
Amendment, a Hollywood group that condemned investigations of the
film industry by the House Un-American Activities Committee.
</P>
<P>
   There are also letters from viewers and memorandums from unnamed
FBI officials to Hoover about Marx's hit television show ``You Bet
Your Life,'' which appeared in the 1950s. One viewer complained
that Marx had called the United States ``the United Snakes.''
Hoover's secretary replied that she would call it to the director's
attention.
</P>
<P>
   When another viewer complained that ``You Bet Your Life'' was
``full of communist propaganda'' because Marx was making fun of the
automobile industry, Hoover wrote back that the FBI did not have
the authority to furnish evaluations ``concerning the character or
integrity of any individual.'' Hoover enclosed with his letter a
copy of ``What You Can Do to Fight Communism and Preserve
America.''
</P>
<P>
   Wiener, who wrote a book about John Lennon's FBI files,
suggested that the FBI investigated Marx because the columnist
Walter Winchell had called Marx's band leader, Jerry Fielding, a
communist sympathizer. Wiener said that Fielding had been
subpoenaed as a witness by the House committee and believed that
the committee was pressuring him to name Marx as a communist.
</P>
<P>
   Wiener said, ``Fielding refused to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Marx dismissed Fielding at a sponsor's behest, but said
he regretted it.
</P>
<P>
   There is no mention of Fielding in the file.
</P>
<P>
   Marx, Wiener writes in The Nation, ``seems to have been a man of
the left, and later, of liberal principles _ for which posterity
may thank him.'' Still, Wiener wrote, ``As he once said: `Why
should I care about posterity? What's posterity ever done for
me?'''

AT TORONTO FESTIVAL, ELITE TAKE BACK SEATS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Only half a dozen years ago Toronto was a backwater on
the film-festival map. Cannes, Venice, Berlin, Sundance and New
York were among the higher-profile festivals that lured movie
stars, top directors and distributors seeking to promote films and,
in some cases, discover them.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happened to us is phenomenal,'' said the Toronto Film
Festival director, Piers Handling, a 49-year-old film academic and
author. He was seated in his busy office on Bloor Street, in the
heart of Toronto, which has essentially been taken over by the 23rd
annual festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically,'' he said, ``the structure of the festival has
always been the same. The films have a wide diversity, from the
most esoteric to the most mainstream, from studio films to movies
from Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan.''
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen movie stars _ including Tom Cruise, Meryl
Streep, Billy Bob Thornton and Cameron Diaz _ as well as scores of
Hollywood studio executives, American, Asian and European
distributors, 600 journalists and, perhaps most important, 250,000
Canadian filmgoers have turned this year's Toronto festival into
one that rivals any of the more noted ones.
</P>
<P>
   The eclectic festival, now the largest in North America, ranges
from glitzy premieres of films like Dreamworks' animated ``Antz,''
with the voices of Woody Allen, Sharon Stone, Sylvester Stallone
and others, to ``The City,'' a wrenching neorealistic series of
dramatic vignettes about impoverished Latin American immigrants
exploited in the New York garment district, with mostly
nonprofessional actors starring in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a world we haven't seen before in films,'' said David
Riker, who began the project as a New York University graduate
student.
</P>
<P>
   What sets the Toronto festival apart from many of the others is
not only its sheer size _ more than 300 films, including 144 world
premieres, are being shown _ but the fact that Toronto has a
decidedly nonelitist air.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult, if not impossible, for an average moviegoer to
attend the other festivals, which are crammed with agents, studio
executives, filmmakers, VIPs, hangers-on and anyone with
connections. By contrast, the Toronto festival is available to
typical filmgoers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The audiences, the actual civilian audiences, here are
amazing,'' said Mark Ordesky, the president of Fine Line Films.
``They're film literate. They're very enthusiastic. Is there any
other festival where people line up around the block in the early
morning to watch films from Morocco?''
</P>
<P>
   What transformed the festival was, essentially, Hollywood's
realization that Toronto was an extremely friendly, and fairly
close, launching pad for upscale studio films. (A funny, if
low-grade, comedy like ``There's Something About Mary'' wouldn't
open in Toronto.) This year, for example, Paramount unveiled ``A
Simple Plan,'' a bleak and funny drama about greed, directed by Sam
Raimi and starring Thornton, Bill Paxton and Bridget Fonda.
</P>
<P>
   ``People here are kind of receptive and laid back about
movies,'' said Thornton, seated in a hotel room on Saturday
afternoon, hours before the opening of his film. ``They're not
cynical like other places where they go wanting to think of clever,
horrible things to say about a movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Friedman, vice chairman of Paramount Motion Picture
Group, was even blunter. ``It's the highest-profile North American
festival, and it's great for generating publicity, generating
excitement. That's why studios come.''
</P>
<P>
   The nine-day festival was opened on Thursday night with a
Canadian drama, ``The Red Violin.'' The film, about the travels of
a violin over three centuries, stars, among others, Samuel L.
Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   The more noted films (made by either studios or
quasi-independent companies owned by studios) include ``Pecker,''
directed by John Waters; ``Dancing at Lughnasa,'' with Ms. Streep,
directed by Pat O'Connor; Kirk Jones' ``Waking Ned Devine'';
Richard LaGravanese's ``Living Out Loud''; Roberto Benigni's ``Life
Is Beautiful'' (which was shown at Cannes), and Gary Ross'
``Pleasantville.''
</P>
<P>
   But these larger films were more or less dwarfed by the flood of
smaller movies from Europe and Asia as well as the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the common themes in many of the films, Handling,
the festival director, said: ``There seem to be two widely
divergent trends. There are a lot of dark, unsettling films. Films
about dysfunctional families, films about substance abuse. At the
same time we see a lot of more prominent films that are romantic
feel-good comedies. It's just so surprising that the trends are so
far apart. There seem to be two different realities out there, one
where people are trying to put their relationships back together
and the other where people feel hopeless.''

</P>
<P>
   One vivid reality was evident in ``The City,'' Riker's film,
which was first shown early Saturday night. By Sunday morning Riker
was set to meet several distributors, although his film's
commercial prospects are uncertain. The black-and-white film,
almost entirely in Spanish with English subtitles, is reminiscent
of the postwar Italian neorealistic work of Roberto Rossellini.
</P>
<P>
   Riker, who is 35 and lives in New York, won an Academy Award and
a Director's Guild Award in 1995 for his modest student film ``The
City'' (``La Ciudad''), which was the basis for the expanded movie
shown in Toronto. He said the current film cost about $1 million,
the bulk of it from the Independent Television Service, a division
of PBS.
</P>
<P>
   The film deals, in a series of generally bleak and sometimes
harrowing episodes, with Mexican and Central American families in
New York, many of them illegal immigrants, many of them exploited
as workers in sweatshops or pick-up jobs on streets.
</P>
<P>
   The episodes are simple and often heartbreaking. A homeless
father, seeking a better life for his daughter, cannot enroll her
in school because he has no proof of residency. A seamstress,
working in a sweatshop, struggles desperately for money owed to her
to help her sick child in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're very, very closely based on the true experiences of
immigrants I spoke with,'' said Riker. One episode, about a young
day laborer who is killed scavenging for bricks in a derelict
building, was based loosely on a newspaper article.
</P>
<P>
   Riker said that most of the actors were nonprofessional and were
found in churches and small grocery stores and on street corners.
He said they went through months of workshops and improvisations
before facing the cameras.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I wanted to do, from the very beginning, was make a film
about uprootedness,'' said Riker.
</P>
<P>
   At the opposite end of the festival's extremes from Riker, who
is sharing a room at a local Howard Johnson's, are stars like
Cruise, who is here promoting ``Without Limits,'' the film he
produced about the runner Steve Prefontaine, and Cameron Diaz,
arguably the fastest-rising actress in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Diaz, who stars in ``There's Something About Mary,'' one of
the most successful films of the summer, came to Toronto to promote
the film ``Very Bad Things,'' a bleak movie about a bachelor party
that goes awry.
</P>
<P>
   Seated in a conference room at the Four Seasons, Ms. Diaz
shrugged. ``I still don't actually think I'm at a film festival,''
she said. ``I can be anywhere right now. I hear Toronto's a great
place.''
</P>
<P>
   Hours earlier, Don McKellar, a top actor, writer and director in
Canada, sought to put some perspective on the festival. McKellar,
who is 34, is connected to no fewer than six films being shown
here, and The Globe and Mail of Toronto recently called him ``the
most ubiquitous presence at this year's festival.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheerfully unpretentious, McKellar said: ``The whole star issue
is very complicated in Canada. It's slightly unbecoming. People
have a very ambivalent attitude toward promotion, celebritydom, the
star system. Very unlike the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   McKellar said the film festival itself was, of course,
peculiarly Canadian.
</P>
<P>
   ``People see a lot of movies here, they're very informed and
very serious about movies, and it has to do with that whole thing
of observing culture, which is a very Canadian thing,'' he said.
``We have a kind of observer status looking all the time at
America, this big machine, sort of disinterested but fascinated at
the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   McKellar laughed. ``I'm not supposed to admit this, but most of
the time we define ourselves in reaction to America, on how
different we are from America.''

TECHNOLOGY: DOES INTERNET USE CAUSE DEPRESSION? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Tenn.)  (mk) 
 By DENISE CARUSO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert Kraut, co-author of a new study linking depression with
Internet use, sounded a bit depressed himself last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was finished with this,'' Kraut, a professor of
social psychology and human-computer interaction at Carnegie Mellon
University, said with a sigh. He was alluding to the flood of
attention _ and criticism _ that his study, titled ``Home Net,''
had received since it was published two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in 1995, ``Home Net'' researchers gave PCs and free
Internet accounts to 169 people in 73 families in the Pittsburgh
area. After monitoring their online behavior, in some cases for
more than two years, the researchers concluded that spending time
on the Internet was associated with statistically significant
increases in depression and loneliness.
</P>
<P>
   Critics assert that the study has fatal flaws that neutralize
its findings and that they are appalled at the authors'
far-reaching conclusions about the impact the findings might have
on Internet policy and technology development.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Hoffman, a Vanderbilt University professor and outspoken
critic of Internet research design, was unequivocal about the
``Home Net'' study.
</P>
<P>
   ``Speaking as an editor, if this had crossed my desk, I would
have rejected it,'' said Ms. Hoffman, who edits the journal
Marketing Science. ``The mistakes are so bad that they render the
results fairly close to meaningless.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those mistakes, she said, were the absence of two standard
safeguards: a control group and random selection of subjects.
</P>
<P>
   ``With `Home Net,' we don't know for sure what led to their
results,'' Ms. Hoffman said of the lack of a control group,
``because we don't know what happened to people who weren't using
the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the study recruited people from high schools and
community service organizations, instead of selecting people
randomly from a large area. Random selection is crucial to building
a truly representative sample of a population _ in this case,
residents of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that one hour a week online led to small but
measurable increases in depression and loneliness and loss of
friendships. While those measurements might well be statistically
significant, critics assert that without a random sample, they are
meaningless outside the group that was studied.
</P>
<P>
   ''The assertions have no statistical relevance to any population
of Internet users beyond those in the study population _ even in
principle,'' declared Charles Brownstein, a former director at the
National Science Foundation, now an executive director at the
Corporation for National Research Initiatives in Reston, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Although research studies do not always have to use control
groups or randomly chosen participants to be valid, Ms. Hoffman
said, those safeguards become imperative ``when you're doing a
study that claims causal relationships and that these relationships
hold in the larger population.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Home Net'' team clearly made such claims. For example, the
news release stated that ``Carnegie Mellon Study Reveals Negative
Potential of Heavy Internet Use on Emotional Well Being,'' and even
suggested that parents move PCs out of teen-agers' bedrooms and
into shared family rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Kraut was quoted extensively in the release, with such
statements as, ``We were surprised to find that what is a social
technology has such anti-social consequences.'' Also: ``Our results
have clear implications for further research on personal Internet
use. As we understand the reasons for the declines in social
involvement, there will be implications for social policies and for
the design of Internet technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Kraut wearily defended his study. ``In 1995, we did
start with a control group, but it was very hard to keep it, with
little in the way of incentives for them to continue to fill out
questionnaires,'' he said. ``And we couldn't use a random sample
because of the nature of the study's design _ we wanted to be able
to include groups who already had social connections with each
other so we could observe some shifting, if it was going to occur,
between existing social relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   And despite criticism of the researchers' methods, he said that
the study was widely applicable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have changes big enough that they aren't likely to have
occurred on the basis of chance,'' Kraut said. ``There is something
here to explain.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics like Ms. Hoffman look askance at such results, given
her experience debunking other Internet studies, including one from
Neilsen Media Research in which she participated in 1996 and
another in 1995 in which Marty Rimm, a graduate student in Carnegie
Mellon's College of Engineering, published a study purporting to
show that the Internet was overrun with pornography.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of Rimm's study, though based on false premises and
quickly discredited, was profound. The resulting furor in the media
and in Congress helped bring about the Communications Decency Act,
which the Supreme Court ruled was a violation of the First
Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Critics fear that the ``Home Net'' study might end up having a
similar effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to imagine the results of this study being used to
influence policy decisions about Internet access, especially in
controversial funding decisions for schools and libraries,'' Ms.
Hoffman said.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, Ms. Hoffman said, protecting the Internet itself
is not the point.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to protect the standard of research,'' she said.
``This isn't obscure ivory-tower stuff that never sees the light of
day. It has an impact on people's lives. If we're going to the
trouble to study the Internet, at least we should make sure we're
doing it right.''

ADVERTISING: PRIVACY IN CYBERSPACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Advertisers and agencies involved in aiming online
sales pitches at children are being exhorted to toughen their
policies for protecting privacy or suffer the consequences of
growing demands from parents and government officials for
restrictive regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Those stern warnings were heard on Friday at a daylong
conference at the World Trade Center in lower Manhattan that was
described by its organizers as a ``guide to safe harbors and sound
practices online.'' The conference, the third of its kind, was
sponsored by the Children's Advertising Review Unit, an
organization that is a crucial part of Madison Avenue's longtime
efforts to resolve disputes about advertising without outside
intervention.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done a pretty good job so far,'' Elizabeth Lascoutx,
vice president and director for the children's unit, said in her
opening remarks to the 85 people at the conference. ``But we have a
long way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Concerns about privacy in cyberspace are intensifying as sites
for children proliferate on the World Wide Web. There are
increasing consumer perceptions that many marketers are reluctant
to address problems like the overzealous collection of personally
identifiable information from young computer users and the porous
handling of such data.
</P>
<P>
   ``One site is asking kids for their Social Security numbers,''
Parry Aftab, a lawyer who specializes in interactive issues, said
in her keynote speech. ``How frustrating is that?''
</P>
<P>
   Those involved in the children's Internet market ought to be
``joining forces and writing a privacy page so kids know what to
give out and not give out,'' said Ms. Aftab, the author of ``A
Parents' Guide to the Internet ... And How to Protect Your
Children'' (SC Press, 1997).
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to find a workable solution,'' she added, ``or we'll
lose the wonderful wealth of creativity and content that sites can
offer.''
</P>
<P>
   The advocacy of self-regulation by the children's unit had been
echoed enthusiastically by the Clinton administration, which sent
Ira Magaziner, the president's Internet adviser, to the 1997
conference to applaud efforts to establish voluntary guidelines to
police online peddling to youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   But in June, a report from the Federal Trade Commission said
legislation might be required because violations of children's
privacy online were discouragingly frequent and safeguards were
woefully absent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not suggesting the advertising industry attracts none but
the truly altruistic,'' said Walter O'Brien, president of the
National Advertising Review Council, which administers the
children's unit along with the Council of Better Business Bureaus
and three industry organizations. ``But it's enlightened
self-interest to make a commitment to ethical advertising,
particularly to children under 12.''
</P>
<P>
   And last month, the FTC accused Geocities, a company known for
offering members access to so-called virtual neighborhoods, of
ignoring the privacy policy posted on its site and engaging in
misleading practices that included disseminating information
gathered from children.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to look very far to see a fundamental mistake
there, a mistake we cannot make anymore,'' said John Kamp, senior
vice president at the American Association of Advertising Agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``In legal terms, it's called fraud,'' he added with a smile.
``In general terms, it's called `Do you know what you're doing?'''
</P>
<P>
   ``The more our customers trust us, the more we succeed in
developing the relationships with them that make our Web sites
work,'' Kamp said. ``Privacy is the great opportunity to
distinguish ourselves from our competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Kamp's organization is one of the three involved with the
children's unit; the others are the American Advertising Federation
and the Association of National Advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC ``has been very supportive of self-regulation in
children's advertising,'' said Toby Milgrom Levin, a lawyer with
the commission who worked on the Geocities case. ``We recognize
that the advertising industry did rise to the occasion and develop
conventions to protect children from deceptive and overreaching
ads.''
</P>
<P>
   But the belief that advertisers are dawdling about the Internet
is likely to lead Congress to act, she said, and ``there may well
be hearings by the end of the month'' on a bill that ``authorizes
the FTC to prescribe regulations to protect the privacy of children
under 16.''
</P>
<P>
   To forestall legislation, ``you can make privacy a front-burner
concern,'' Ms. Levin advised, especially among top management.
``The Webmasters are not in a position to make privacy happen,''
she added.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, more of those involved in putting up Web sites are
becoming sensitized to privacy matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Privacy is in the forefront of all our programming
decisions,'' said Tina Sharkey, vice president and general manager
of the CTW Online unit of the Children's Television Workshop in New
York, which plans to introduce Monday a redesigned site called the
CTW Family Workshop (www.ctw.org).
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't collect information from children under 13,'' she
added, at areas on the site that are sponsored by marketers like
Ford Motor Co. and Kellogg Co. ``And parents are told everywhere
they can sign up that they can opt out with a `click here.'''
</P>
<P>
   More than one speaker referred to the timing of the conference,
coming as it did while computer users caused some Internet gridlock
in searching for the report on President Clinton by the Whitewater
independent counsel, Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   ``If any group in this country understands the danger of private
information going public and having an impact on their lives,''
said Dan Jaffe, executive vice president at the Association of
National Advertisers, ``it's our politicians.''

TECHNOLOGY STOCKS' WORST MAY BE PAST, EXPERTS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Investors seized on some unexpected good news Friday from Intel,
Oracle and National Semiconductor to drive technology shares
higher.
</P>
<P>
   Upside surprises have been few and far between in recent months,
so there is a strong incentive among prospective stock buyers to
extrapolate a recovery in technology from these three data points.
And indeed, some analysts said that so many companies had either
warned beforehand of poor results or had come in below estimates in
the quarters ending in March and June that a sizable number would
now beat Wall Street's diminished expectations for September and
December. Whether that kind of performance qualifies as a recovery
is still open to discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Look at Intel, which said Friday that its third-quarter sales
would be 8 to 10 percent higher than the $5.9 billion reported in
the second quarter, rather than flat, as it had suggested earlier.
While 10 percent sequential revenue growth is enormous, it is only
in comparison to the weak June quarter, which showed no revenue
growth over the period a year earlier and a 29 percent drop in
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, National Semiconductor said revenue would be up over
earlier forecasts because of strong August orders, but it said
orders were still down 30 percent, year over year.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Oracle announced per-share earnings on Thursday
that were several cents above analysts' estimates, thanks primarily
to stronger-than-expected license revenue from its traditional data
base business. But in applications, where Oracle has placed its
hopes for growth, revenue was flat, and the company still lags far
behind rivals like Peoplesoft and SAP of Germany. Oracle remains
the dominant data base company, but that market is widely regarded
as mature.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, many analysts are ready to call a bottom. The
Philadelphia Stock Exchange semiconductor index, which reached a
peak late in April, nearly three months earlier than the broader
technology sector as reflected by the Nasdaq composite index, may
also turn out to be an early indicator of a market turnaround. The
semiconductor index was up 8.70, to 211.52, on Friday and has now
gained 11 percent from its 52-week low on Sept. 1 of 190.04.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PC inventory correction is over and PC demand is
seasonally higher in the second half of the year,'' said Mark
Edelstone, an analyst with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. He noted
that the pickup in National Semiconductor's orders was primarily in
the company's personal computer-based product lines, and that
Intel, of course, was uniquely positioned to benefit from stronger
PC sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intel is the first company to get healthy,'' he said. ``The
rest of the industry still lags.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Edelstone said he did not expect many positive surprises in the
semiconductor business in the third quarter, but he does in the
fourth. ``We will see a contraction of the negative surprises,'' he
said. ``In the second quarter, more than 20 semiconductor companies
preannounced negatives; 55 percent were below estimates. I think we
can cut that number in half.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Murphy, editor of the California Technology Stock
Letter, takes an even more bullish view. ``What's going to happen
going forward is what we're seeing today,'' Murphy said on Friday.
After scaling back earnings estimates in the first half of the
year, ``in the September and December quarters, technology
companies are going to beat estimates pretty generally because
we're in the right part of the product cycle,'' he said, adding,
``At the same time, the Asian crisis is finally biting in the old
economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Technology companies could flourish even as blue-chip companies
head into recession because they are typically driven by product
cycles rather than economic cycles. With the Microsoft Corp.'s
release of Windows 98 in May, and its anticipated release of
Windows NT 5.0 next year, more corporations are likely to upgrade
their PC's, and that will ripple through the industry, Murphy said,
giving a lift to makers of semiconductors, disk drives and
software.
</P>
<P>
   John Rossi, a managing director with BancAmerica Robertson
Stephens, said technology stocks were the first to fall as a result
of the Asian crisis but might also be the first to recover.
</P>
<P>
   ``The blue-chip companies took longer to feel the effects of
Asia, but next year a lot of these companies will do the bulk of
their spending to fix year 2000 problems,'' Rossi said. ``Maybe not
a lot will happen in the first half, but the second half of the
year should be very strong, thanks to Windows NT and 13th-hour
spending on year 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Roger McNamee, a principal in Integral Capital Partners, which
specializes in technology stocks, agrees that technology companies
could prosper, even in an economic downturn, but he takes a more
cautious view. Personal computer technology, he said, ``is the
likely place people will do triage in terms of capital spending.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every company sees technology as their way out of this
economy,'' McNamee added.
</P>
<P>
   But technology producers will not all benefit equally, McNamee
said. The current market is good for a company like Dell Computer,
which is selling ever-greater percentages of higher-end servers,
and challenging for Hewlett-Packard, selling more and more
low-priced consumer PC's.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Intel is telling you is, `Hey, the world didn't end,'''
he said. ``But as much as everyone would like to draw broad
conclusions, I don't think it's appropriate.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forget all the talk about the global, freewheeling Internet.
Nearly two years after the first online city guides appeared, many
companies are still betting that the real action on the Internet is
in such local online markets.
</P>
<P>
   From its start, the business of producing locally oriented Web
sites that offer everything from concert listings and restaurant
reviews to commuter traffic reports and school lunch menus, has
been one of the Internet's fiercest battlegrounds. Some cities
boast as many as half a dozen full-blown Web sites clamoring for a
share of local advertising, media support and loyal users.
</P>
<P>
   The lure is tempting indeed. Local businesses in the United
States will spend a total of $70 billion on advertising this year.
Of that, says Jupiter Communications, the Internet research firm in
New York, $700 million will be spent online, a figure that analysts
say will almost double in 1999 and will continue to rise well into
the next century.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, not all the local Web guides that have sprung up can
survive in markets crowded with nearly indistinguishable
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Already the business has shown signs of cracking. Earlier this
year Microsoft Corp. was forced back to the labs for a new approach
to its network of local guides, Streets, laying off a quarter of
its editorial staff in the meantime. Likewise, America Online's
Digital City has regrouped in a process that cut 80 staff members.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of those areas where you have too many people doing
close to the same thing,'' Patrick Keane, an analyst at Jupiter
Communications, said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, there have been few real casualties, and new
partnerships are leading to new sites and new business strategies
every day. Most recently, for example, Citysearch, a pioneer in the
city guides, merged with the Ticketmaster unit of USA Networks with
the idea of more closely integrating event listings with the
ability to sell tickets immediately to the events.
</P>
<P>
   With the Citysearch/Ticketmaster union, someone interested in
seeing ``Titanic'' on the big screen would be able to find out
where it was playing and then instantly buy a ticket. Eventually,
consumers will also be offered many related transactions at the
same time, like the opportunity to buy Titanic memorabilia and make
reservations at a restaurant near the theater.
</P>
<P>
   Though services like these have long been promised by local
guides, no company has yet delivered all the pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Citysearch, of Pasadena, Calif., is in a quiet period as it
prepares to go public, so executives were not available for
interviews. But the merger with Ticketmaster last month is perhaps
the best signal yet that online guides are quickly moving from
simply providing information to performing transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most notable local online activity recently has been
in the newspaper business, where an aggressive upstart, Zip2, has
managed to forge partnerships with 160 papers around the United
States. Twenty of those deals have led to full-scale city guides,
said Elon Musk, chairman and founder of Zip2, which is based in
Mountain View, Calif. The remaining deals have produced local
guides within newspapers' Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Among the full-scale guides is New York Today, a result of a
partnership between Zip2 and The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   One of the primary things Zip2 provides newspapers with is an
online Yellow Pages with links directly into store listings and
reviews. Zip2 also offers a personalization feature, calendar
listings and free e-mail. Through a deal with Zip2, The Boston
Globe, a New York Times Co. newspaper, offers event and local
information as a part of Boston.com, the regional Web site it
created in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts agree that local newspapers could have an inherent
advantage in the local online market because they can tap material
they already develop for print and use the strength of their brand
to attract both advertisers and customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always said it's the newspaper industry's battle to
lose,'' said Keane of Jupiter.
</P>
<P>
   Citysearch has also linked up with newspapers, including The Los
Angeles Times, which is owned by Times Mirror Co., and Time Out New
York, a weekly arts and entertainment magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The Toronto Star, owned by Torstar Corp., is working with
Citysearch and Tele-Direct, a local phone company that supplies
Yellow Pages listings. Likewise, in the crowded New York market,
Microsoft Sidewalk licenses entertainment listings from The Village
Voice.
</P>
<P>
   The most innovative newspaper effort may be the Real Cities
network started a year ago by Knight Ridder, publisher of a chain
that includes The Miami Herald, The Philadelphia Inquirer and The
San Jose Mercury News. The idea is to give online media buyers a
network for placing local Web ads, while giving the Web sites
access to editorial material and tools like the News Hound program,
which delivers news personalized to the needs of each user.
</P>
<P>
   Knight Ridder's strategy is similar to that of Cox Enterprises,
which last year opened a series of Web sites based on its newspaper
and television properties.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the greatest competitive threat comes from one of
the Internet's oldest properties, Yahoo, which offers links to
local content and has become the front door for millions of
Internet users. Though Yahoo's half-dozen local sites do not offer
much in the way of original content, they do carry brand
recognition and an already captive audience, which might prove
crucial in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the real battle is with Yahoo and AOL to become a
local portal,'' Musk, of Zip2, said. ``They're building down to the
local level, whereas we're building up to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Microsoft and America Online, despite their perceived
missteps, appear to be gearing up for the fight again. Microsoft
Sidewalk, now published in nine cities, is readying Version 3.0 of
its service for roll-out by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to offer a national version in which much of the
content will be identical from one city site to another but will be
supplemented by local information about restaurants, performances
and retailers and will carry a combination of local and national
ads.
</P>
<P>
   The new Sidewalk will place a greater emphasis on helping
consumers shop, including the addition of Yellow Pages, said the
service's product manager, Gayle Troberman.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Atkins, Sidewalk's general manager for advertising sales
and marketing, said, ``More and more merchants want to come online
and reach people right when they want to buy.''
</P>

   nn
</P>
<P>
   Anecdotal evidence would suggest that local businesses are
indeed coming online, selling everything from clothing and
computers to hotel rooms and vacation packages, and realizing a
decent return on their investment.
</P>
<P>
   Sal Patel, reservations manager at the 70-room Union Square
Hotel, says his monthly listing in Citysearch San Francisco
typically pays for itself within a day or two.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts predict the pace of development of new online city
guides will probably not last long. Despite all the interest from
advertisers, no city guide has consistently shown a profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing isolated incidents where these sites are making
money,'' said Peter Kraslinsky, an analyst at Arlen Communication,
a research company that studies interactive transactions. ``But
mostly they're spending with minimal returns.''
</P>
<P>
   Many producers of online guides acknowledge that the effort has
proved a more expensive proposition than they expected. Musk says
that by hooking up with major media players, Zip2 expects to be
profitable sooner than the companies that try to do the bulk of the
editorial work themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Though the demand for local information and services is huge, it
is anybody's guess how many competing services each market can
support and whether the services can turn investments into profits.
Lisa Allen, a new-media analyst at Forrester Research, said,
``Becoming a media operation and making money at it are a lot
easier said than done.''

   &UR; Bill Clinton &LR;  was to have been the honored guest on `` &UR; Martha &LR;

Stewart, no ``Stand By Your Man'' kind of woman, dumped him.

</P>
<P>
   The book is one of many in the San Francisco Library's Gay and
Lesbian Center, which is named after  &UR; James Hormel &LR; ; its
circulation is an attempt to further damage his chances of

   &UR; KERRY FOR 2000? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Windsurfing Senator  &UR; John F. Kerry &LR; , D-Mass., has picked up the
2000 presidential endorsement from American Windsurfer magazine.
</P>
<P>
   A 27-page profile of Kerry in the magazine includes his profound
thoughts about education (``the most critical concern'') and the
spirituality of the  &UR; Dalai Lama &LR;  (``who I've spent time with and
who is absolutely intriguing'').
</P>
<P>
   Kerry's press secretary said he was going to ``work on the

</P>
<P>
   Playwright  &UR; Paul Rudnick &LR;  decries the popularity of the beauty
makeover, ``a last ditch assault on feminist progress,'' in the big
fat fall issue of Vogue.
</P>
<P>
   While makeovers humanize public figures, ``reducing  &UR; Janet &LR; 
 &UR; Reno &LR;  and  &UR; Madeleine Albright &LR;  to career gals experimenting with
lip gloss at Kmart,'' Rudnick calls them ``the opposite of style --
they are personality kits. ... At best, they are a form of playing
rainy-day attic dress-up; at worst they are  &UR; Michael &LR; 
 &UR; Jackson  &LR; attempting a racial revamp.''
</P>
<P>
   As to televised talk show makeovers, Rudnick proposes a show
called ``The Hose.'' ``On this show, people previously made over on
 &UR; Leeza Gibbons &LR;  or  &UR; Ricki Lake  &LR; would be led center stage and
blasted with fire hoses. Eventually, we would see what they really
look like without the Crayola lipliner and evening-drama cheekbone
glitter. Then each contestant would be given the option of either
facing the world as some semblance of their actual self or suicide,
perhaps by liposuction.''

MTV VIDEO MUSIC AWARDS: SALUTE TO TASTELESSNESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By NEIL STRAUSS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ What is happening in music today? MTV certainly
doesn't know. That's why it has been replacing program directors
and staff every few months. Recently, the channel told the
thrash-rock band Korn not to bother making any videos for its new
album. But last month, when Korn had a hit on the radio and it
became clear that the band's album was going to be No. 1 on the pop
charts, MTV called back. It wanted a video after all.
</P>
<P>
   MTV is not alone in its confusion. Music television, commercial
radio stations and mainstream magazine covers have become
increasingly reliant on market research, primarily because ratings
and circulation are so important to their advertisers. As a result,
the era of the individual with an ear to the ground _ a popular
disk jockey or magazine whose role is to find good artists and
expose them to a mass audience _ is over. The mall rules. Just look
at all the poll-takers walking around the food court with
clipboards. One result is events like the MTV Video Music Awards, a
three-hour salute to tastelessness that took place on Thursday
night at the Universal Amphitheater here.
</P>
<P>
   The big winners were Aerosmith, the Beastie Boys, Will Smith and
Madonna (the formerly controversial singer who used to speak in an
American accent and who walked away with the Best Video Award among
five others). Rewind 10 years, and the winners could have been the
same.
</P>
<P>
   Two things are happening: On the popular front, music is in a
lull (maybe a quiet before the storm), and to fill the gap, it's
back to the '80s. ``The Wedding Singer'' may have catered to the
growing market for '80s nostalgia, but the Video Music Awards were
the decade's coming out party.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the finale featuring the former Stray Cat Brian Setzer,
Beck wearing new-wave sunglasses and a muscle shirt as he
breakdanced onstage, the return of New Kids on the Block in the
form of the Backstreet Boys, and the predominance of old-school
hip-hop scratching throughout the night.
</P>
<P>
   Even at the after-show party at Universal Studios, an airplane
flew overhead advertising a concert by the '80s electronic pop band
Depeche Mode, and executives chattered about the return of '80s
arena metal.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most atypical performance at the ceremony was by
Master P, the Louisiana entrepreneur resurrecting gangsta rap on
his No Limit label. Recently, Master P has become an MTV fixture
not because the cable channel likes something about his music, but
because it has been forced to bow to his phenomenal record sales.
The most powerful arbiter of musical taste in the '90s is not MTV
or radio, but Soundscan, the upstate New York company that every
Wednesday releases regional and national statistics on exactly how
many records are being sold by various acts and genres. These
reports are scrupulously pored over by executives at MTV, record
labels and radio stations, who then make their decisions. They are
analyzing the water but ignoring the wave, and a result is a rerun
culture, where today's pop music is doomed to repeat yesterday's
successes.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, the awards show touched on larger topics than the
return of the '80s and MTV self-promotion. During their acceptance
speeches, Adam Yauch of the Beastie Boys spoke out against the U.S.
missile attacks on sites in Sudan and Afghanistan, and Wyclef Jean
of the Fugees criticized a line in ``How Stella Got Her Groove
Back'' that associated Haiti with AIDS. But Master P's street-style
performance of ``Make 'Em Say Uhh'' _ a melee of people playing
basketball, tumbling and dancing onstage _ was the best evidence
that music was connected to something more real in the outside
world than Versace and Prada.
</P>
<P>
   The awards themselves have never really mattered. Over the
years, MTV and its sister station VH1 have lost their faith in the
music video, first as a block of programming to hold the viewers'
attention for half an hour (thus the rise of programs like ``Real
World'') and then as a medium capable of holding someone's
attention for even a few minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with ``Beavis and Butt-head'' and increasingly with
shows like ``12 Angry Viewers,'' ``Pop-Up Video'' and ``Say What,''
it has become plain that MTV and VH1 don't like to show videos
alone. They put animated characters, words of explanation and faces
of viewers on the screen at the same time, in case people get bored
with just the video. If you factor in the heavy hand MTV censors
have in the videos, it doesn't add up to much respect for the video
as an art form.
</P>
<P>
   What the awards show has always been about is mixing a bunch of
celebrities in a room and waiting to see what unpredictable
shenanigans arise. This year, there were hardly any, a definite
reflection of the current stasis in American pop culture. Like
``Godzilla,'' the awards show became an event because it kept
saying it was, with MTV promoting the show literally 24 hours a
day.
</P>
<P>
   And like ``Godzilla,'' the marketing was more exciting than the
product.

 &HT;    Despite thrilling finish, tire talk still wags tongues in
Richmond
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHMOND, Va. _ They couldn't beat Jeff Gordon in the tire test
last week, so they beat him on the track at Richmond International
Raceway on Saturday night. Jeff Burton's margin of victory over
Gordon was a hood length, .015 seconds and the closest Winston Cup
finish of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Roush, owner of Burton's winning No. 99 Ford, felt
confident that he had scored a victory for fair play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think all the competitors feel better about the new policy
NASCAR has, which limits the teams from bringing tires from home
that are of unknown pedigree and putting them on pit road to go on
the cars,'' Roush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every competitor had the same tires off the Goodyear truck
(Saturday night). It, for sure, was a fair race. There is no
question that could be raised by me or anybody else about whether
or not somebody had special tires.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Roush insinuated that Gordon's crew might be
doing something illegal, like using chemicals on tires to create an
unfair advantage. Roush said that was enabling Gordon's No. 24
Chevrolet to win with two new tires late in the race while other
teams were racing with four.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR allows teams to bring back tires purchased at a track in
the season's second race, but all teams must start and finish races
with tires dispensed on race weekend.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR said its independent lab tests revealed that Gordon's
tires were clean, and Roush was criticized for his allegations. But
Burton stood up for his boss after holding off Gordon during the
last three laps of Saturday's Exide 400.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jack Roush had the confidence in himself to bring up an issue
that 85 percent of the car owners behind closed doors were talking
about,'' Burton said. ``And Jack Roush was the only one that had
enough guts to say it and try to do something about it. So as other
car owners have stayed quiet, Jack has been part of making a policy
that will guarantee fairness in racing, and what's wrong with
that?''
</P>
<P>
   Roush claimed the Saturday night victory wasn't particularly
vindicating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever you can beat the 24 team you've really done
something,'' Roush said. ``They've got a great program. I had
exactly one problem with the way the program had been going, and
that was the fact that in two of the last three races, including
the Loudon race, they put on two tires and outran cars with four
tires, and you just can't do that on anything but maybe Darlington
and Talladega.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Saturday night) the tires were a factor,'' he said. ``Of
course, I'm looking for closure on the tire thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Both teams took four tires on their last pit stop, contrary to
what Gordon said about Burton's two tire swap at the end of the
race.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been so much controversy about to tires,'' Burton
said, ``I wouldn't dare do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton had the dominant car all night, leading for 203 of the
400 laps, including the last 40. But he pointed to a caution with
35 laps to go as the key to his second victory of the season. ``We
were in trouble with a long run,'' he said. ``We had gotten by him,
but he was going to come back and getting that caution was a key.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton was asked early last week if he and Gordon were the next
great stock car racing rivalry. Not even the Exide victory could
make him buy into that odd concept.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's won 10 races; we've won two,'' Burton said. ``I've got to
get off my butt and win some more races.''

 &HT;    Miracles of modern medicine make Neagle confident
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Idle since Sept. 1 while his left shoulder cooled off,
Denny Neagle insists he will make his next start, scheduled in
three days when the Braves open a four-game series in Arizona.
Better living through cortisone.
</P>
<P>
   ''It got to the point where I was just playing catch,'' he said,
''and unless I threw (side-arm) like Brad Clontz, as soon as I'd
reach a little bit, it was grabbing me. That's what bursitis is,
though. You get all that inflammation and it doesn't let you
extend.''
</P>
<P>
   Neagle has had two throwing sessions since Tuesday's cortisone
injection and surely wants to return to the mound. Having solved a
1-4 slump that dated back to mid-July, the left-hander is on a
three-game win streak and one more win would give him 15.
</P>
<P>
   Significant because he has reached 15 victories only once before
in his career, Neagle could also make history by becoming the the
team's fifth 15-game winner. Not since the 1930 Washington Senators
has a staff had five pitchers reach 15. The last National League
club to do so was the 1925 Pittsburgh Pirates.
</P>
<P>
   ''In my own personal goals, I always try to get 15 wins,'' said
Neagle, who turned 30 on Sunday. ''I think that's a good number to
shoot for at the start of the season. Even more important, it has
more significance. That's something you should be proud of. The
first time since 1930? That's incredible.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously, I'm going to down-play it and say I'm not going to
be thinking about it when I'm pitching. It's only natural to say
you want to get this so I can compliment everybody else. It's
obviously not comparable to McGwire's year but there are only so
many times that a season like this rolls around.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitching plans
</P>
<P>
   Neagle's return has little bearing on the future use of rookie
of Bruce Chen, who went 1-0 in the two starts he made in Neagle's
absence. Manager Bobby Cox will soon be moving Kevin Millwood to
the bullpen, to re-acclimate him for relief work he will be doing
in the postseason. As well, the team is still considering passing
over John Smoltz, if not just giving him an abbreviated start, in
the last two weeks to give some relief to his right elbow. Chen
would find service in either scenario.
</P>
<P>
   Wounded knee
</P>
<P>
   Danny Bautista's right knee will still not allow him back into
action, 21 days after the club placed him on the disabled list.
Though the team believes the slight tear found in his medial
colateral ligament is the result of an old injury, Bautista's knee
has become too loose to allow him to maneuver in the outfield.
</P>
<P>
   ''He isn't ready yet,'' said Cox. ''He can't turn. We'd hoped to
have him on the (postseason) roster. He's not 100 percent yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Bautista's absence makes an October opportunity for Curtis
Pride, who has started in both left and right field and provides
some speed for the bench. He also gives Cox three left-handed
hitting outfielders of out five, but right-handed pinch-hitter Greg
Colbrunn evens out the mix.
</P>
<P>
   Hola, Raffy
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Walt Weiss made his second start in three days without
incident, a development which just about eliminates any chance of
Rafael Belliard appearing in a Braves uniform again this year, if
ever. On the 60-day disabled list after tearing his quadriceps in
the second week of the season, Belliard rejoined the club this
weekend after completing a three-week injury re-hab assignment in
Richmond, which he capped off with his fourth career minor-league
home run off Norfolk's Josias Manzanillo.
</P>
<P>
   But a healthy Weiss, with a healthy Ozzie Guillen sharing time
with him, spells an end to Belliard's career with the Braves. Since
he is on the 60-day disabled list, which would require dropping
someone from the 40-man roster to activate him, only an emergency
would get him back on the team this season.
</P>
<P>
   ''The last two weeks, I was playing all nine innings and it felt
very good,'' said Belliard, 36. ''I wasn't feeling anything wrong
with my leg.''

 &HT;    Poet's son back with memoir, memories
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Atlanta that Christopher Dickey returns to this
week is vastly different from the city he grew up in during the
1950s. Back then, he and other students at Brandon-Morris
Elementary School huddled under their desks during nuclear attack
drills, and parents talked nervously of impending integration.
</P>
<P>
   And Dickey's father, James Dickey, was still more famous for his
Coca-Cola jingles than for his poetry.
</P>
<P>
   ``No city in the South was a more suitable home for an
advertising man,'' Dickey says in his memoir, ``Summer of
Deliverance: A Memoir of Father and Son'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster,
$24.95). ``Slogans and jingles, with a little chicanery and a lot
of chutzpah, were as natural to Atlanta as the rhetoric of fire and
brimstone was to the rural parishes just beyond its horizons.''
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of his return to the city of his youth, Dickey, 46,
the Paris bureau chief for Newsweek, talked about what it feels
like to come home again.
</P>
<P>
   _ Q: In your book, you talk about the years of estrangement from
your father. Was your childhood in Atlanta a happy one?
</P>
<P>
   _ A: Yes, it was. We lived a quintessentially suburban life at
2930 Westminster Circle, which was a dead end in those days. That
was when I was 8 or 9, and we would go hunting and canoeing in
North Georgia. And there was a little creek and a lot of weeds and
a few trees near the house. In the summer you'd come across snakes
down there. The dangers of nature were a little closer to our
suburbs than anybody really wanted to admit.
</P>
<P>
   _ Q: Have you visited the house where you grew up ?
</P>
<P>
   _ A: I did when I was working on the book a couple of years ago.
I didn't go in, because somebody's living there. It's a very small
ranch house, and it was a very nice place to live when I was little
boy. It doesn't look as big as I remember it. I also went to my
grandmother's house at 166 W. Wesley. It seemed like a huge
distance to her house then, but I drove it the last time I was
here, and I was amazed it was so close. I've often thought of going
and knocking on the door and introducing myself, but I know it
wouldn't look the same. And it wouldn't smell the same.
</P>
<P>
   _ Q: Do you remember your neighbors?
</P>
<P>
   _ A: Across the street from us lived a salesman. One summer he
had a Fourth of July party. There was a street parade with
crepe-paper streamers on our bicycles, and we ran three-legged
races and ate Waldorf salad and fried chicken and watermelon. Dad,
I remember, won the husbands' beautiful-legs contest. Farther up
the street, toward Howell Mill, was a woman who'd survived a
concentration camp and had a number tattooed on her arm. She also
had rows of little red-and-white pins on the visor of her car to
show how many times she'd given blood to the Atlanta Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   _ Q: What kind of feelings do you have about the city?
</P>
<P>
   _ A: Atlanta was a town I lived in when I was a little boy and
it's been a long time since I was a little boy. Most of my visits
have been quick hits on business or for funerals, so I never had
much sense of the town, and certainly not as my town. I'm looking
forward to going back now. It always had a lot more texture and
complexity than most of the cities in the South. And since my
father and I started talking to each other before his death, I find
myself identifying more with Atlanta as his town.
</P>
<P>
   _ Q: In ``Summer of Deliverance,'' you were very hard on your
father about his drinking and abusive behavior. What would he have
thought of the book?
</P>
<P>
   _ A: I think my father would be very happy with the book. I have
gotten a little tired of reading that line where it says I hated
him, but a lot of reviewers recognize the book is about how much I
loved him.

 &HT;    Designers buck tradition with early-bird showings
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Helmut Lang wouldn't be considered one of America's
most influential fashion designers if he didn't produce such nice
white blouses.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Karan's claim to fame is the fact that her stretchy,
solid-colored clothes look good on average women's physiques.
</P>
<P>
   And Calvin Klein's underwear, jeans and fragrances have adorned
millions who might never have worn his couture designs.
</P>
<P>
   So, when Lang, Karan, and Klein decided to preview their
spring/summer 1999 womenswear collections this week _ rather than
wait to show their clothes in November with the majority of
America's top designers _ it filled the fashion world with the sort
of frightful uncertainty best reserved for armed conflict between
nations, weather disasters or outbreaks of disease. The irony of
the situation is that Lang, Karan and Klein are famous for the
simplicity of their designs, and yet they're the reason everything
is suddenly so complicated.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar de la Renta, the (BEGIN ITAL) eminence grise (END ITAL)
among New York designers, said he was sticking with the November
schedule because ``It's too tramatic and impossible for me to
switch.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was naughty of Calvin Klein to do this (plan an earlier
show in September) without talking to the Council of Fashion
Designers (a governing body of fashion designers). I have always
wanted to accommodate retailers and the press. I never did a show
at 9 p.m. in the evening or in a place that's difficult to get to
in New York. I think when you are in a position of power, like many
designers are, you use this power in a nice way, not in a way to
inconvenience retailers and the press.''
</P>
<P>
   For decades, New York's top designers have always waited for
their counterparts in England, Italy and France to unveil their
womenswear collections on a biannual basis before sending their own
seasonal styles out onto the runway. That tradition ended when Lang
_ an Austrian who moved his operation from Paris to New York last
year _ announced that the time-honored schedule didn't work for him
and that he would be staging his spring/summer '99 preview on Sept.
17, six weeks before anyone else in New York had planned to show.
</P>
<P>
   Calvin Klein _ who's customarily afforded the honor of being the
last American to stage a preview during the citywide expo known as
Fashion Week _ followed Lang's lead. Things snowballed from there:
Nicole Miller, Vivienne Tam, Karan, and others jumped aboard the
beat-Europe-to-the-punch bandwagon.
</P>
<P>
   In one of his few explanatory statements to the press, Lang
said, ``One thing I don't understand is why New York wants to be
last (in fashion) when it wants to be first in everything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Karan told reporters that she opted to show early because ``It
makes more sense for the retailer to see the collection first and
then (order) the collection. It also helps us for organization and
delivery.''
</P>
<P>
   The perceived benefits of being a New Yorker who shows before
the Europeans do are more conceptual than tangible. Perhaps showing
first will gain the American designers a greater share of retail
sales space if their collections are the first, rather than the
last, that the buyers see. And perhaps fashion editors will stop
accusing American designers of borrowing ideas from the Europeans
if they see what New York has to offer first.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, perhaps not.
</P>
<P>
   The facts are these: Designers don't usually stage runway shows
until weeks after they've already shown their collections to the
stores and magazine editors who really determine what'll be
considered stylish six months hence; and most of the world's top
designers now rely on the same manufacturers, so victory goes to
those who contract to have their clothes made the most swiftly.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Klein issued a statement saying, ``The advantage is
that we will be able to go into production much earlier. I as a
designer who now has a global business had to have collections
ready earlier. It's from the business point of view that this
really makes sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Kalinsky, who owns the Bob Ellis Shoes, Jil Sander and
Jeffrey boutiques at Phipps Plaza in Atlanta, concurs with Klein's
assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The earlier they show the better,'' he said. ``It's great for
the Americans to be first; they are just as valid as European
designers. I love American design, and now I'll see the collections
before I've been to Europe and spent all my dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   Invitations to this week's major runway shows wouldn't be nearly
as sought after as tickets to the Yankees or ``Rent'' if not for
fashion arbiters' hunger to be among the first to see and say what
the best-dressed people should be wearing. By causing this
confusion _ being the commercial masterminds that they are _ Lang,
Klein and Karan are merely throwing fat onto the fire of (BEGIN
ITAL)fashionistas' (END ITAL) ascination.
</P>
<P>
   It's really that simple.

 &HT;    Roseanne short on words about talk show
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ ``Daytime is where things are being said,'' said
Roseanne, before she said very little about her talk show, which
debuts today at 5 p.m. on WGNX.
</P>
<P>
   Could she tell us something about the first show?
</P>
<P>
   ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   Just a little?
</P>
<P>
   ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   A teeny . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``You just have to watch it. I'm not going to hype it,'' she
said during a conference call designed to hype the show to
reporters around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I hype it, two things happen,'' Roseanne went on. ``As soon
as you say what you're doing, it's stolen immediately. And you
can't talk about this stuff. You have to see it. It'll ruin the
surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   What's been stolen so far, considering that, you know, the show
hasn't aired yet?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to answer any of that.''
</P>
<P>
   A call was placed to King World, the show's syndicator, to shed
a different light on things.
</P>
<P>
   Do you know who's going to be on the first show?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' said publicist Randi Cone.
</P>
<P>
   No.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trying to be flexible. They're taping Whoopi Goldberg
today (Friday). But they're going to pick the best show for the
first one.''
</P>
<P>
   Roseanne, former sitcom star and ``Star Spangled Banner''
stylist, has already taped about 10 shows. Among the guests who'll
appear the next couple of weeks: Dennis Rodman, Ellen DeGeneres,
Judge Judy, Dame Edna, Reba McEntire, Tori Amos, Patti LaBelle.
</P>
<P>
   Did Roseanne tape each show as if it were the premiere, with
references to it being her first show?
</P>
<P>
   Pause.
</P>
<P>
   ``Needless to say,'' said Cone, ``as the PR person for the
company, I didn't choose to do it this way.''
</P>
<P>
   Pause.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watch the show,'' Cone finally said. She sounded really nice.
``She (Roseanne) is so good. There's nothing like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing like it?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a fan of everyone who's ever had a talk show,'' Roseanne
said. ``And I'm stealing from all of them.''
</P>
<P>
   There you have it.

 &HT;    Love her or hate her, `Ally McBeal's' back
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Her hair has gotten a little lanker, the eyes seem a bit bigger,
the skirts, if possible, a little shorter. She's Ally-er than ever,
and she's back tonight for the start of season two.
</P>
<P>
   For the blissfully unaware, ``Ally McBeal'' (9 tonight on Fox )
was more than just a breakout hit last season. It was the McBuzz _
endlessly chattered about, obsessed over, dissed and dissected. A
dithery, klutzy attorney in her late 20s, Ally (Calista Flockhart)
had minis that were too minimal, neuroses that were too ridiculous,
hallucinations that were too weird, and a dewy romanticism that
made her seem oh so huggable or relatable, depending on your
gender. Or, for other viewers, the exact opposite of all that.
</P>
<P>
   Whimsy is perhaps the toughest act to maintain _ just ask the
writers of ``Northern Exposure'' and ``Moonlighting,'' both of
which set their bars very high and then kept settling for
cutesiness or quirkiness. ``Ally'' may have it tougher than either
of those shows, not least because at this point, David E. Kelley
has written every single script, and he just can't keep that up.
And even Kelley has trouble living up to his own reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Take tonight's premiere. It's not bad, it's just not the
knockout fans of the show are hoping for after a summer of re-runs.
We're back in the unisex bathroom for a round of mistaken
identities. Ally's back with her sarcastic shrink (Tracey Ullman).
There's a kinky court case, about a 39-year-old woman who had an
affair with a 16-year-old boy. Cage (Peter MacNicol) is wistfully
recalling ``Summer of '42,'' while Richard Fish (Greg Germann) is
adding to our too-much-information list of his turn-ons (Shari
Lewis and his stock portfolio tonight, though not the two
together). It's kinda nice to dip back into their dippy lives, but
there's also a feeling that the show is verging on self-caricature
at times.
</P>
<P>
   New to the mix tonight is blond ice queen Portia de Rossi as
Nelle Porter, an attorney whose nickname is ``Sub-Zero.'' She's
beautiful and brainy, so the guys are all groveling and the women
are all catty. Nelle isn't showing much of her hand yet, but she
gives the impression she could spank them all soundly and send them
to bed. Which may _ who knows? _ be next week's episode. Grade: B

STRONG SHOWING BY BAVARIAN CONSERVATIVES BOOSTS KOHL'S CHANCES 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MUNICH, Germany _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl's prospects for
re-election got a significant lift Sunday, when Bavaria's
conservative Christian Social Union won a decisive victory over the
Social Democratic Party in state-wide elections.
</P>
<P>
   Based on exit polls Sunday evening, the Christian Social Union _
the Bavarian sister-party to Kohl's Christian Democrats _ received
more than 52 percent of the vote. The opposition Social Democrats
received about 29.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Just two weeks before Germans vote for chancellor in national
elections, the results Sunday were a surprising setback for Gerhard
Schroeder, Kohl's Social Democratic challenger for chancellor.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder, who had been barnstorming across this bastion of
conservatism in the last two weeks, had set a goal of improving on
the 30-percent share that Social Democrats received here in 1994.
The Christian Social Union had been fighting to hold on to at least
50 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Political experts and politicians alike were cautious about
reading too much into Sunday's results. Bavaria has the strongest
economy and lowest unemployment rate of any German state, and
political leaders have carefully distanced themselves from Kohl in
their campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the vote was considerably better for the
conservatives and considerably worse for the Social Democrats than
most people here had expected. Schroeder and other party leaders
had campaigned hard in order to use the Bavarian vote as a solid
sign of their growing strength. Conversely, the Bavarian Premier,
Edmund Stoiber, had campaigned heavily on the theme of villainizing
Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a clear drubbing for the Social Democrats,'' gloated
Stoiber at the majestic Bavarian statehouse Sunday night. ``This
showed a clear shift among voters to the benefit of the ruling
coalition'' in Bonn.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian Social Union, which is only active in Bavaria, is
a member of the center-right coalition led by Kohl's Christian
Democratic Union. The other party in the coalition is the much
smaller Free Democratic Party, which represents the most reliable
pro-business voters in Germany. Although Stoiber and his party
remain popular and were not expected to lose control of the state
government, they had been struggling to retain an outright majority
of votes and therefore of seats in the state parliament. Recent
polls indicated their support had fallen to almost exactly 50
percent, down from 52.8 percent in the previous election, and the
Social Democrats appeared to be attracting about 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, Schroeder continues to lead Kohl in all polls and
the Christian Democrats are still considered the underdogs. But
Sunday's news was the first solid indication that Schroeder's
momentum may be weakening.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this will definitely have an effect on the national
election,'' said Theo Waigel, who is both chairman of the Christian
Social Union in Bavaria and Kohl's Finance Minister in Bonn. ``I
had begun to sense the change in sentiment for some time.''
</P>
<P>
   But Social Democrats argued that Sunday's results had no
significance for the election for chancellor later this month,
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a Stoiber election, but on Sept. 27 the choice will
be between Schroeder and Kohl, and people will choose Schroeder,''
said Renate Schmidt, the party's candidate for premier of Bavaria.
</P>
<P>
   In Bonn, Schroeder and other national party leaders said they
would still prevail. ``Despite the results in Bavaria, the SDP will
still win the national election,'' Schroeder insisted.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There is still no doubt that voters here are far more loyal to
the Christian Social Union that to the broader ruling coalition in
Bonn. This is, after all, a state that still likes to think of
itself as a separate country from the rest of Germany and where
people sing what amounts to a national anthem at major public
occasions.
</P>
<P>
   During the campaign battles of the last few weeks, Stoiber has
carefully avoided appearing on the same stage as Kohl or even
mentioning Kohl's name in his speeches. Stoiber has also been a
vociferous critic of Kohl's most passionate project, the creation
of a single European currency that will eventually replace the
German mark, and he has also infuriated other members of the ruling
coalition by proposing that wealthy states like Bavaria be freed
from having to underwrite social security costs for poorer states.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the incumbent conservatives here have a strong
tailwind that their counterparts in other parts of Germany do not
have. Unemployment is far lower here, at 6.1 percent, than in any
other state in Germany. The economy is growing faster, with local
companies like BMW and Porsche booming and a new generation of
technology companies settling here to take advantage of a skilled
work force and generous support from the state government.
</P>
<P>
   Under Stoiber, the state has privatized more than $3 billion
worth of state-owned businesses and used that money to invest in
new infrastructure and provide venture capital for new companies.
The loquacious and combative premier routinely boasts about
``Lebkuchen und Lasers'' _ gingerbread and lasers _ and remains far
more popular than Kohl.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, recent surveys by the Enmid polling organization have
shown that more than 70 percent of voters feel positively toward
Stoiber, but less than 45 percent feel that way about either Kohl
or Waigel.

FOX DROPS DRAMA ABOUT CLARENCE THOMAS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz.)  (lb) 
 By GERALDINE FABRIKANT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fox Television has scrapped a television drama based on
``Strange Justice,'' a book about the sexual harassment charges
against Clarence Thomas, after Rupert Murdoch, chairman of News
Corp., Fox's owner, objected to the project, several people in the
industry said.
</P>
<P>
   The book, written by two reporters for The Wall Street Journal
and published in 1994, concluded that Anita Hill was telling the
truth in making the charges during Senate hearings on Thomas'
nomination to the Supreme Court. The National Book Awards, in
naming the book a finalist, described it as a ``meticulous
investigation.'' Despite the accusations, Thomas was confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Murdoch put a halt to the project two weeks ago after reading
the book, according to several people close to the situation. He
told an associate that Thomas was a friend of his, that Thomas had
been railroaded in the confirmation hearings and that he did not
want Fox to proceed with the project, according to one of those
people.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, a well-known conservative, seems to share at least some
of Murdoch's conservative views.
</P>
<P>
   Murdoch has a history of supporting conservative politicians as
well as curtailing projects that might affect the financial health
of his company. Four years ago, he dropped the BBC news service
from Star-TV, his Hong Kong-based satellite service, after the
Chinese government protested its coverage of Chinese dissidents.
</P>
<P>
   And in February, in apparent deference to the Chinese
government, Murdoch killed a book by Chris Patten, the last British
governor of Hong Kong, that was scheduled for publication by
HarperCollins, another News Corp. property. Patten's book took a
tough stand on China's human-rights abuses, criticizing the
government's intentions after Hong Kong was returned to China and
showing how it set out to subvert moves to greater democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Murdoch has worked assiduously to court the conservative
establishment. Indeed, on Friday he was the host of a fund-raiser
for Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who was described in Murdoch's
invitation as ``an outspoken leader for the telecommunications
industry.'' McCain is chairman of the Commerce, Science and
Transportation Committee, which oversees the Federal Communications
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The invitation that went to top News Corp. executives requested
that they contribute $1,000 each. Such invitations are not unusual,
experts said, though some entertainment companies, like Viacom
Inc., have not held such fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   Murdoch did not return repeated telephone calls seeking comment.
And Jim Platt, a company spokesman, said Murdoch was not inclined
to talk to the press on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   However, Jacob Epstein, the screenwriter on the project and a
writer for both ``Hill Street Blues'' and ``L.A. Law,'' said: ``I
was told that Fox was very excited about the script, and that was
confirmed when they announced it as the inaugural movie for their
new network, in a banner story'' in Daily Variety, the
entertainment trade paper.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, on July 24, an article in Daily Variety said that Fox
Television Studios would begin producing films for its FX cable
network and that the first project would be an adaptation of
``Strange Justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Epstein continued: ``Then I learned two weeks ago that Murdoch
had asked for a copy of the book `Strange Justice,' to read over
the weekend, and on Monday the project was dead.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Strange Justice,'' written by Jane Mayer and Jill Abramson, is
a detailed study of the congressional hearings in which Ms. Hill
accused Thomas of sexual misconduct. Ms. Mayer is now a writer for
The New Yorker, and Ms. Abramson is now a reporter at The New York
Times. Fox paid the pair roughly $20,000 for an option on the book,
according to an executive involved in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Neither David Grant, president of Fox Television Studios, nor
Marci Pool, senior vice president for movies and miniseries,
returned repeated phone calls. But according to several people
close to the situation, Grant and Ms. Pool were notified that
Murdoch had read the book and did not want the studio to go
forward. Fox had already hired Steven Haft to be the executive
producer of the show, and Epstein had completed a script.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Chernin, president of 20th Century Fox, the parent of Fox
Television, said in a telephone interview that Murdoch had never
read the script and was not involved in the project's termination.
``The script was always intended to be reasonably comedic, and it
was not funny,'' Chernin said. ``The script came in and they did
not like it. It was passed on by the network.'' But he did not deny
that Murdoch had read the book.
</P>
<P>
   But despite Chernin's statement that Fox passed on the script,
the actress Whoopi Goldberg confirmed in a telephone interview last
week that she had read the script and been offered the role of Ms.
Hill. ``It was very good,'' Ms. Goldberg said. But she turned it
down, she said, because she was busy on other projects.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   This is not the first time a televised version of ``Strange
Justice'' has run into trouble. Two years ago, Ted Turner, a vice
chairman of Time Warner Inc., stalled a television production of
the book by the Time Warner network TNT for fear of offending
Thomas during the Supreme Court's deliberations over a cable
regulation case whose outcome could have enriched Time Warner by
millions.
</P>
<P>
   A Turner spokesman said at the time that the project had never
been on a ``production track.'' But a person close to the
production recalled last week that ``the project had been on a fast
track and then it became too hot to handle.'' This person added
that it was common knowledge at a lower level that it was too
controversial. Turner paid the authors roughly $75,000 for an
option on the project, this person added.
</P>
<P>
   Chernin's efforts to blame the quality of the ``Strange
Justice'' script parallels Murdoch's attempts to cover up his role
in killing Patten's book on Hong Kong, ``East and West.''
</P>
<P>
   The Daily Telegraph in London printed a copy of a confidential
HarperCollins memo acknowledging Murdoch's assessment of the
``negative aspect of publication'' of the book and setting out a
strategy for disguising the reason for abandoning publication.
</P>
<P>
   That memo, sent by Eddie Bell, executive chairman of
HarperCollins U.K., to Anthea Disney, chief executive of News
American Publishing, another subsidiary of News Corp., expressed
great anxiety over how a ``hostile press'' might report the move.
</P>
<P>
   The book's editor, Stuart Proffitt, was quoted as saying that he
had been told by Adrian Bourne, managing director for the
HarperCollins trade book division, that the book was being dropped
because the material did not match the original outline.
</P>
<P>
   Proffitt was ordered to inform Patten that the book was being
dropped because it was below standard. He refused and was
suspended. Then he sued for breach of contract. News Corp. settled
with both Patten and Proffitt, though the sizes of the settlements
were never disclosed.

ARGENTINE LEADER VOWS TO RETAIN CURRENCY PEG TO DOLLAR
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina _ It has become almost a daily ritual.
President Carlos Saul Menem and his chief economic advisers take
every opportunity to promise that they will not retreat from the
government's fixed exchange rate that pegs the value of the
Argentine peso to the American dollar one to one.
</P>
<P>
   Such pronouncements have often preceded huge devaluations in
Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   But most Argentine economists and Wall Street analysts are
taking Menem at his word, at least for now, despite concerns that
the currency peg could push up interest rates and unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will hold,'' said Jorge Mariscal, chief investment
strategist for Latin America at Goldman, Sachs. Before devaluing,
Mariscal said, Argentina would, in a severe crisis, probably
``dollarize'' its economy as Panama has for decades _ replacing its
currency with dollars.
</P>
<P>
   In part, the cautious optimism that Argentina will not have to
devalue comes from the slight strengthening in the Japanese yen in
recent weeks. That has relieved concerns that China will have to
devalue, which in turn has helped Hong Kong sustain its currency
peg to the American dollar. But if the yen slides again, or the
Brazilian real suddenly collapses, Argentina could face deep
financial trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point the only way I could foresee a change is if
capital flight were so massive it would mean everyone would convert
their pesos into dollars,'' said Martin Redrado, a former Menem
adviser who runs an economic research center here. ``But so far the
Argentine banks have weathered this crisis very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Argentine program has attracted global attention
recently, with Indonesia and Russia considering similar policies.
Indonesia rejected a peg to the dollar while Russia has yet to
adopt a rescue plan.
</P>
<P>
   All five presidential candidates vying to replace Menem in
elections next year have promised not to replace the peg because of
fears that a change of policy could mean a return to economic
mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with an inflation rate of 2,300 percent and a run on the
banks, Menem installed the currency peg in 1991. Within weeks, the
inflation rate plummeted and has stabilized at around 1 percent in
the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   Currency stability and an aggressive government program of
privatizing public agencies drew a flood of foreign investment,
which in turn stimulated strong economic growth rates that peaked
at 8 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   The currency peg is set by a law that prohibits the government
from printing new pesos unless they are backed by dollars or gold
reserves in the central bank. Other laws require private banks to
keep 25 percent of their reserves in the central bank. And as added
insurance, the government has negotiated lines of credit with a
number of investment banks, including Goldman, Sachs; Morgan
Stanley and Lehman Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the growing economic crisis in Venezuela and Brazil, the
Argentine government reports that it has $24.5 billion in reserves
in the central bank, slightly more than the total amount of pesos
in circulation. Even more impressive, local economists note, is
that private bank deposits actually grew last month by five-tenths
of a percent despite the bad news from Asia and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tangible economic gains from the convertibility program
argue heavily in favor of retention of convertibility despite any
ill consequences,'' said Lawrence Goodman, chief economist at
Santander Investment, the investment banking arm of Banco
Santander.
</P>
<P>
   Goodman noted that when faced with a similar economic crisis
after the Mexican devaluation in 1994, Menem did not budge from the
peg despite rising interest rates and an unemployment rate that
climbed as high as 18 percent. Unemployment has since fallen to
14.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Still, convertibility has a price. Since it is linked to a
strong dollar, Argentine exports are expensive and are dropping.
According to the latest government statistics, Argentina's trade
deficit in July climbed to $741 million, more than double the
amount of the month before. Since 30 percent of Argentina's trade
is with Brazil, a devaluation and deepening recession there over
the next several months would only make the Argentine deficit grow
faster.

 &HT;    AMID CRISIS, BOTH PARTIES MUST DEAL WITH LEGISLATION
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton and congressional leaders will
try this week to set aside his woes and get back to grappling with
national and global priorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're focusing on the job we have to do,'' said Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss. Describing a Republican
strategy session of Senate and House leaders Thursday, he said,
``We talked about the appropriation bills, tax cuts, agriculture
issues, higher education, financial services modernization,
bankruptcy reform. We didn't talk at all about this other matter.''
</P>
<P>
   The president echoed those sentiments Saturday in his radio
address. ``The most important thing to do now is to stay focused on
the issues the American people sent us here to deal with _ from
health care to the economy to terrorism,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the ``critical issues'' pending before Congress
include fiscal discipline, support for the International Monetary
Fund, and support for education, patients' rights, the environment
and campaign finance reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may think they mean it,'' said John Hibbing, a University
of Nebraska political scientist who has studied Congress
extensively. ``But my hunch is, they're going to be preoccupied
(and) it's going to be difficult to have a productive legislative
period before the mid-term election.''
</P>
<P>
   Routine spending bills _ either individually or bundled into an
all-encompassing ``continuing resolution'' _ are likely to pass. So
are minor tax cuts, said Michigan State University political
scientist David W. Rohde.
</P>
<P>
   But he said he doesn't anticipate agreement on non-monetary
matters such as patients' rights or environmental and educational
policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, I don't think anything much would have been done on
them this year anyway, even if we'd never heard of Monica
Lewinsky,'' Rohde said. Unlike arguments over money, philosophical
differences over issues like regulation and provision of health
care cannot be resolved by splitting the difference, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gridlock on such issues hasn't seemed to hurt either Clinton or
Congress this year. Both have seen their poll ratings rise and stay
high.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's been a feeling in Congress of 'let's not do so
much that we screw that up,' `` Hibbing said.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, Congress will have to push hard to meet its goal of
finishing the routine appropriations process within the next month.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 13 annual spending bills, only one has become law. Two
bills are stalled in the House, another is stalled in the Senate,
and eight have yet to emerge from Senate-House conference
committees. In fact, the leaders still haven't gotten around to
naming the members of several conference committees.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., said the GOP leaders
``agreed that we're going to work very hard to get all the
appropriations bills done to ensure that the government stays open
and to have no excuse for the president to try to distract
attention by shutting the government.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans have absolutely no other choice,'' Rohde said.
It is they, not Clinton, who will face the voters in November, he
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a mistake for them to think the president is going
to automatically cave in to them because of the problems he's
having,'' Rohde said. ``It's exactly the opposite: They'll be
dealing with a president who will be very wary that Republicans
might try to take advantage of him.''
</P>
<P>
   One potential battleground will be income tax cuts, a longtime
GOP priority.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the tax-writing House
Ways and Means Committee, said the Republicans want to use 10
percent of the expected budget surplus to pay for a five-year
package of $80 billion in tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   But Gingrich said the other 90 percent must be set aside as a
contingency fund for next year's Social Security reforms, rather
than used to fund Clinton's request for about $20 billion above the
amounts that Republicans want to spend. The extra money would be
used for readying government computers for the year 2000, enhancing
security of U.S. embassies, providing emergency aid to farmers and
maintaining peacekeeping troops in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Finance Committee Chairman Pete Domenici, R-N.M., last
week floated a compromise proposal. ``We have a very large surplus.
I have concluded that if we are going to do spending increases
which break the (spending) caps, then we ought to do tax cuts right
alongside it,'' Domenici said.
</P>
<P>
   Shooting down that trial balloon, Senate Democratic Leader Tom
Daschle, D-S.D., on Friday said, ``There is no way Democratic
senators will support raiding Social Security for an $80 billion
tax cut.''
</P>
<P>
   Daschle's statement, as Rohde pointed out, left room for
Democratic approval of a smaller tax cut.

A CALL FOR DIGITAL SURVEILLANCE IS DELAYED
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a setback for the FBI, the Federal Communications Commission
has given the telecommunications industry an additional 20 months
to comply with a federal law meant to bring law enforcement
surveillance into the digital age.
</P>
<P>
   But in extending the deadline the commission deferred action on
some of the most disputed facets of the issue, which has pitted law
enforcement officials against telephone equipment manufacturers,
network-service providers and privacy-rights advocates.
</P>
<P>
   The Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act, passed by
Congress in 1994, was intended to address complaints by the FBI and
local law enforcement agencies that they were rapidly losing their
ability to conduct wiretaps and other forms of electronic
surveillance in the face of modern digital and wireless
communications networks.
</P>
<P>
   But industry groups had long warned that they would be unable to
meet the approaching Oct. 25 deadline for complying with the law by
installing the software and hardware that would allow for
court-authorized surveillance on modern networks. The FCC order,
issued on Friday, extended the deadline to June 30, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials said they were tentatively pleased
with the ruling _ not by the delay, but by the setting of what they
said they hoped would be a firm deadline, following months of
uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very heartened that a clear signal has been sent by the
FCC,'' said Stephen Colgate, an assistant attorney general. ``There
needs to be some finality to this process.''
</P>
<P>
   He would not comment, however, on the FCC's decision to defer
action on other issues involving the new surveillance capabilities,
saying he had not yet had an opportunity to review the entire
order.
</P>
<P>
   The order leaves unresolved some questions raised by industry
executives and privacy experts who had argued that the FBI was
using the law both to expand its wiretapping capabilities as well
as add new capabilities like the ability to track the location of
cellular telephone users and intercept Internet traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``This ruling is really a prelude to the privacy fight,'' said
James Dempsey, a telecommunications expert at the Center for
Democracy and Technology, a privacy rights group in Washington.
``For now the commission has given itself and the industry some
breathing room. They've said, `Don't rush into these additional
surveillance areas.'''
</P>
<P>
   The decision came in response to a request for a deadline
extension that was filed in March in a joint petition by AT&AMP;T
Wireless Services, Lucent Technologies and Ericsson. Manufacturers
are adding features to network switching equipment that permit a
greater number of simultaneous phone calls to be monitored by law
enforcement officials and accommodate modern telephone calling
features like call forwarding and conference calling.
</P>
<P>
   FCC officials deferred their decisions on expanding the
capabilities to include providing location information in cellular
telephone networks and embracing Internet packet-switching
technology. But they did indicate their awareness that their
rulings on such matters could have a significant impact on privacy
rights in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we go forward with this important proceeding, we need to
make sure that law enforcement has the most up-to-date tools
available to catch criminals,'' William Kennard, the commission
chairman, said in a statement. ``But we need to balance the needs
of law enforcement with Americans' rights to privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   One industry representative said Friday that he was pessimistic
about the possibility in the long run of limiting law-enforcement
officials' access to user-location data on wireless networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is going to create a demand for this, and when that
happens the FBI is going to have access to that information,'' said
Stewart Baker, a lawyer in Washington who represents the cellular
telephone industry.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The current privacy dispute centers on access to computer data
that will track a cellular telephone user's location only to the
vicinity of the closest cellular network transmitter, which might
be hundreds of yards or even several miles away from the person.
</P>
<P>
   But a number of companies are now at work on powerful
technologies based on global positioning satellite, or GPS,
receivers _ as well as alternative approaches _ that might pinpoint
the user's location within 20 feet or so.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC has already mandated that cellular systems begin
providing such precise locator data for 911 emergency purposes in
2001. But manufacturers are taking various approaches to
safeguarding access to that information. Several of the systems,
for example, would generate the locator information only if the
cell-phone user switched on that capability.
</P>
<P>
   Surveillance of Internet data is also likely to become a heated
privacy issue as the FCC deliberations proceed. Because of the
nature of packet-switched networks that blend thousands of
communications streams, part of the quandary will be how to provide
law enforcement with access to only the narrowly defined stream of
data specified in a subpoena.

   ``Scientific truths, of whatever order, are reached by
eliminating perturbing or conflicting factors, and recognizing only
fundamental factors,'' wrote Herbert Spencer cogently in ``The Data
of Ethics'' in 1879.
</P>
<P>
   But what if for some reason ``eliminating perturbing or
conflicting factors'' is perceived as deliberately skewing
experimental evidence? This is at the heart of the drama described
so meticulously by the science writer Daniel J. Kevles in his
weighty new book, ``The Baltimore Case: A Trial of Politics,
Science and Character.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, Margot O'Toole, a post-doctoral fellow working in a
laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was asked
to do experiments that would extend the work described in a paper
on an immunological experiment. The paper was written by her
employer, Thereza Imanishi-Kari, along with, among others, David
Baltimore, the Nobel laureate MIT biologist who conceived the
experiment. When O'Toole could not reproduce the results described
in Imanishi-Kari's contribution to the paper, Kevles writes, she
became convinced that her employer had fudged her own results, and
she eventually complained to an acquaintance, who in turn alerted
authorities at the National Institutes of Health that Imanishi-Kari
might have committed scientific fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Occurring at a time when the United States government was
growing highly sensitive to misconduct in the scientific community
and the possible misuse of public funds, what became known as the
Baltimore Case (Baltimore was the paper's senior writer) led to an
investigation by both Rep. John Dingell's House Subcommittee on
Oversight and Investigations and the National Institutes' Office of
Scientific Integrity, and an eventual judgment of fraud on
Imanishi-Kari's part.
</P>
<P>
   Although she was finally exonerated on appeal in 1996, the
decadelong case damaged Imanishi-Kari's career and that of
Baltimore, who, because he defended his colleague so vociferously,
was maligned by many of his peers in the scientific community and
forced to resign from the presidency of Rockefeller University 18
months after assuming it in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The wonder of Kevles' book is the coherence with which he
describes a case so complex that any attempt at summary does it
violence. You read it with a rising sense of despair and outrage,
and you finish it as if awakening from a nightmare that only Kafka
could have conceived.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Kevles _ whose previous books include ``The Physicists'' and
``In the Name of Eugenics'' _ remains meticulous about presenting
every arcane detail raised by both Imanishi-Kari's attackers and
defenders, including, not incidentally, the considerable number of
unintentional errors she made. And his analysis of what happened is
so painstaking that you find it difficult to point any finger of
blame, except possibly at the Dingell subcommittee, which Kevles
accuses of having ``emulated Senator Joe McCarthy in ways that it
perhaps did not realize,'' and at the majority of the media, which
tended to report uncritically what Imanishi-Kari's accusers said of
her.
</P>
<P>
   As for her chief detractor, O'Toole, Kevles characterizes her as
combative, overzealous, hyperpolitical and inclined to see the
world in black and white. But he leaves you with the sense that
O'Toole's primary motive in attacking Imanishi-Kari so doggedly was
her determination to rescue her own career as a scientist, which,
Kevles writes, she saw as having suffered because of her
accusations.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Kevles pays a certain price for his meticulous
attention to the details of the case. He explains that he wrote his
book ``to make its scientific content accessible to nonbiologists
as well as to biologists, keeping discussions of the technical
issues as concise as possible and relegating elaborative material
to the notes.''
</P>
<P>
   But he gives nonbiologists few breaks. He makes no attempt to
create a simplifying metaphor for the experiment, which involved
stimulating the formation of antibodies in mice and which was so
``technically intricate,'' Kevles writes, that even some biologists
``find it difficult to comprehend.'' Nor does he explain the
broader implications, if any, of the experiment's results; he
merely writes that ``taken together, its findings were
remarkable.'' As a result, much of the reasoning in the arguments
over Imanishi-Kari's work simply passes the nonexpert reader by.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the human drama is what matters most in ``The Baltimore
Case,'' the collision of scientists, bureaucrats and politicians in
an arena where money and power are at stake. As Kevles himself
points out, ``At its core, this book is the story of how a great
injustice was perpetrated in the name of scientific integrity and
the public trust and how it then came to be remedied, or remedied
as much as it could be after its weight had been endured for a
decade.'' Today, Imanishi-Kari is a tenured associate professor at
Tufts University and Baltimore is the president of the California
Institute of Technology, in Pasadena, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   And Kevles demonstrates effectively the disastrous consequences
when political agendas are imposed on the process of scientific
inquiry. ``Baltimore may not have appreciated that John Dingell did
not intend to attack American science as such,'' Kevles concludes,
but ``he was justified in thinking that the way Dingell pursued the
misconduct issue in effect threatened the flexibility and freedom
with which scientists approached the understanding of their data.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanislaus Leszcynski, an 18th-century King of Poland, said,
``Science is nothing but good sense and sound reason.'' In ``The
Baltimore Case,'' Kevles shows us at length and with great
eloquence that, alas, this isn't always the case.

<P>
   Picture a slurry, made of wood fiber and fillers like calcium
carbonate or clay, swimming in a sea of water so vast that the pulp
cannot form clumps. Mentally deposit it onto a wire mesh belt,
through which the water drains out at huge pressures and speed.
Feed that belt through a roller press to squeeze the rest of the
moisture out.
</P>
<P>
   Now put your mind's eye into fast forward, and feed the slurry
through the process at 4,000 feet a minute.
</P>
<P>
   That is how fast a modern machine can make copier paper. The
speed is both a blessing and a curse. The slightest variation in
filler-to-fiber ratio, in the ionic charge on the filler or in the
moisture content of the mixture can cause the machine to vibrate,
pockmarking the paper with seemingly imperceptible hills and
valleys that can jam a copier.
</P>
<P>
   And that is if the paper gets that far. Vibration and an
imbalanced formula can cause the paper to rupture on the production
line, forcing the machine to be stopped and the whole batch to be
redone.
</P>
<P>
   Such paper breaks have cost International Paper Co. $100 million
a year. But now, thanks to computerized controls and information
technology, they may soon be history.
</P>
<P>
   There is a paradox here. With $20.1 billion in sales last year,
International Paper is the biggest player in an industry that
visionaries long ago predicted would be a dinosaur in a paperless
society. Well, not only have paper sales grown steadily, but
International Paper has become a power user of the technologies
that were supposed to render it obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   At a paper plant in Selma, Ala., it has installed ultrasensitive
controls that early on can detect the slightest chemical imbalance
or machine vibration and feed the data to computers. Operators in
the control room can double click for a pull-down menu of options _
tinker with the slurry formula, perhaps, or the speed of the
machine _ to prevent anything dire from taking place.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 200 variables that can cause a problem, and even the
best operator couldn't carry them all in his head,'' said Richard
Phillips, head of International Paper's manufacturing technology
center. He notes that the enhanced controls also let International
Paper use more filler in its slurry, saving $50 million a year in
materials costs.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, most paper companies are taking a high-technology
approach these days. They have to. Global papermaking capacity has
soared, and most companies are already churning out fairly
high-quality product at very low cost. Thus, the only way a paper
company can distinguish itself is through customer service, and
information systems are a prime way to provide it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This industry used to think, the smaller your information
technology budget, the better off you were,'' said L. Ronald
Raines, Ernst &AMP; Young's paper expert. ``Well, the I.T. budget in
this industry routinely goes up 30 percent to 55 percent a year.''
</P>
<P>
   The effects of that kind of spending are rampant throughout
International Paper. Is a machine spewing forth low-quality paper?
The company will comb that machine's logs for clues to what
operators did right when everything was running smoothly and what
they did wrong _ say, let the paper slurry get top heavy in some
chemicals _ just before the problem hit. And it will put the
answers into the electronic archives, so operators on similar
machines can learn how to prevent foul-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Is some remote machine malfunctioning in some mysterious way?
Trouble-shooters at the manufacturing technology headquarters in
Loveland, Ohio, will set up video links with operators in the
ailing mill, who can show them schematics of the process, real-time
production data and anything else that can enable them to diagnose
the problem.
</P>
<P>
   International Paper is not just now discovering computers, of
course. It developed the industry's first computerized controls as
a joint project with IBM Corp. nearly 40 years ago, and it has
continually fine-tuned those controls to add speed to its machines
and consistency to its products. It was also among the first to
mechanize payrolls and other back-office operations.
</P>
<P>
   But the scope of its information technology efforts has
broadened mightily in the last year. Karl Moore, its first chief
information officer, was a 38-year International Paper employee and
finance specialist whose primary goal was running the information
department as a low-cost operation aimed primarily at making
scheduling and administrative operations more efficient.
</P>
<P>
   Moore has since gone to Brussels for the company. Late last
year, John Dillon, the company's chairman and chief executive,
hired J. Chris Scalet, the current information officer, away from
Mapco Inc., an energy company, and gave him responsibility for
using computers to make money, not tons of product. ``John told me
to use technology to create a competitive advantage, to
differentiate us in the marketplace,'' Scalet said. ``And that's
meant shifting our focus from reducing costs and administrative
burdens to projects that have a real impact on the revenue side of
the house.''
</P>
<P>
   It is no easy task. It means disseminating real-time information
to operators, salespeople and, increasingly, customers. It means
letting customers buy a myriad of products with one call or
keystroke _ and sending a single invoice for all of them. It means
giving salespeople in the field electronic access to every byte of
information on orders, paper specifications, production schedules
or stocks in hand. And increasingly it means adopting fancy
security checks and systems, and then letting big customers tap
into that data themselves.
</P>
<P>
   But before facts and figures can be widely distributed, they
have to be gathered and codified. Right now, hundreds of
International Paper's computer technologists are working on systems
to insure that every plant uses the same customer and supplier
numbers and maintains common cost data. They are setting up wide
area networks so that the product specifications, production
volumes and other information that is electronically captured from
all of the company's far-flung papermaking machines can be
simultaneously disseminated to accounting, order entry and other
departments.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   International Paper is combing the software world for programs
it can use to monitor every step in the papermaking process, from
the time the logs come into the yard to the time the product shows
up at the customer's door _ and often beyond that, to how it
performs in use.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Tropicana, one of International Paper's big
packaging customers, occasionally complains that some of its orange
juice cartons burst as they are being trucked to food stores. In
response, International Paper electronically bugs a juice-filled
truck, collects a continuous stream of data about temperatures,
vibrations and other variables as the truck follows its normal
route, and analyzes the data to see if the juice package needs
strengthening or if trucks just need to be routed around
pothole-strewn roads.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working to the point that if a customer has a complaint,
we will be able to track the defective piece of paper or package
back through every step it has gone through and spot exactly what
went wrong,'' said William Richardson, manager of process control
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Paper industry experts say that most large paper companies are
chasing the same goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Customers don't just want products anymore, they want
information,'' said Ole Fadum, who runs a paper industry consulting
firm in Boulder, Colo., that bears his name. ``They want to know
what their suppliers have in stock; what they are scheduled to
make; what the product's exact specifications are.''
</P>
<P>
   Providing all that is a herculean task for any paper company.
But the information technology steamroller has had to flatten
particularly spiky obstacles at International Paper.
</P>
<P>
   Because it was one of the first paper companies to develop
extensive in-house computer systems, it is stuck with some of the
most cumbersome ``legacy'' systems around. As are many of its
industry brethren, it is buying huge materials-tracking and
financial systems offered by software giants like SAP, I2
Technologies and Manugistics, but it is having a much harder time
melding them with its existing systems than companies that came
later to information technology.
</P>
<P>
   There are other logistical glitches. The company has been on a
buying binge, acquiring 17 companies in the last five years alone,
and thus is faced with integrating their disparate information
systems into its own. It has also been consolidating plants and
offices. As a result, although International Paper's headquarters
are in Purchase, N.Y., Phillips' manufacturing technology group,
which serves as first port of call for the mills and product
development departments, is in Ohio. Scalet's information
technology group, which handles financial reporting, installing SAP
programs, the year 2000 conversion and customer links, is in
Memphis.
</P>
<P>
   The two technology groups meet quarterly, and the manufacturing
folks transmit streams of data to Memphis each day, but there is
little chance for ideas to spring from encounters at the water
cooler.
</P>
<P>
   That has not stopped Scalet from plunging into the manufacturing
world. He has already assigned 250 of his people to paper mills or
other International Paper departments, to see firsthand how their
processes work and what kind of help they need in getting data to
their customers.
</P>
<P>
   He is investigating ways to sell product on the Internet. And he
has jazzed up the company's internal Web page. Now, mills can use
it to swap surplus equipment, and employees can get access to work
tips _ from the most efficient way to get a stuck log out of a wood
chipper to the best way to run a company function.
</P>
<P>
   He is also making it interactive. Each month, on the chairman's
home page, employees are asked, ``If you were chairman what would
you do?'' about a particular issue and are invited to send in their
answers by e-mail. For now, senior executives respond off line.
Down the road, the company plans to post samples of the employees'
comments on the Internet and install a respond button that will
enable managers and colleagues to react to the suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   Mindful of the need for symbols of change, just last month
Scalet changed his group's name from Information Systems to
Information Technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet isn't a system; a telephone isn't a system,'' he
said. ``Systems can increase productivity and decrease costs.
Technologies can bring in revenues.''

   FCC GRANTS EXTENSION FOR WIRETAP MODERNIZATION
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission has given the
telecommunications industry until June 30, 2000, to install the
software and hardware necessary for court-authorized wiretaps of
modern digital and wireless communications networks.
</P>
<P>
   The extension, which grants a reprieve of an additional 20
months, leaves unresolved some questions raised by industry
executives and privacy experts who had argued that the FBI was
using the law both to expand its wiretapping power and add new
capabilities like the ability to track the location of cellular
telephone users and intercept Internet traffic.

IBM TO ANNOUNCE BREAKTHROUGH IN COMPUTER MONITORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROB FIXMER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   IBM Corp. is planning to announce this week that it has achieved
a much-sought-after breakthrough in computer monitor technology, a
flat-panel screen that produces four times the resolution of
typical desktop monitors yet is driven by off-the-shelf hardware
and software components.
</P>
<P>
   The quad-resolution display screen produces images as
discernible _ and in some cases clearer _ than they are when
printed on paper.
</P>
<P>
   A prototype of the screen is set to be formally introduced on
Wednesday in Japan. It was demonstrated for journalists last week
in New York by members of IBM's research division, which developed
the device under the name Roentgen, after the physicist who
discovered X-rays.
</P>
<P>
   The Roentgen uses liquid-crystal display technology similar to
the screens on notebook computers and existing flat-panel monitors.
But it employs more than 15.7 million transistors to pack 40,000
pixels into every square inch of screen area. That is four times
the number of pixels per square inch in a standard monitor and
twice the number used in the new high-definition television screens
just entering the market. A pixel is the smallest image-forming
unit of a video display.
</P>
<P>
   The Roentgen prototype has a diagonal viewing area of 16.3
inches, about equivalent in screen size to a standard 17-inch
monitor, but is only 2.5 inches thick and weighs less than a third
of a typical cathode-ray tube monitor.
</P>
<P>
   In a demonstration last week, resolution was so sharp that a map
rendered by DeLorme's Street Atlas USA, an off-the-shelf consumer
program, clearly displayed every street in all five boroughs of New
York City on a single screen with legible type.
</P>
<P>
   For the demonstration, the development group used four standard
graphics cards configured to run in parallel under Microsoft
Windows NT 4.0 on a computer powered by a standard Intel Pentium II
microprocessor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market wants to go in that direction,'' Ed Buckingham, an
analyst with the IDG research firm, said on Friday. The big
question mark, he said, would be when, at what price and in which
market the Roentgen would be introduced. For example, he said:
``The medical market will be big for this product. The need to
produce X-rays digitally and other diagnostic tools that require
extremely high resolution mean that in medicine, price will not be
a big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Wisnieff, manager of IBM's advanced-display technology
laboratory, agreed that the product would initially be marketed to
industries with special needs for high-resolution displays, like
medicine, stock brokerage firms and engineering work stations. But
he said the team's goal was to design high-resolution displays
inexpensive enough to be widely adopted for consumer notebook and
desktop computers.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Roentgen could easily be manufactured in the same
plants that already produce IBM's current generation of notebook
screens.
</P>
<P>
   Wisnieff said production schedules and prices had not yet been
set.
</P>
<P>
   Buckingham estimated that the Roentgen would make its way into
IBM's high-end Thinkpad notebooks in late 1999 or early 2000.

RICARDO RAMIREZ, 67, EX-LEADER OF GUATEMALAN GUERRILLA FORCE  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ricardo Ramirez, the Guatemalan guerrilla commander turned
peacemaker who was better known to his countrymen by his nom de
guerre, Rolando Moran, died on Friday in a hospital in Guatemala
City. He was 67 and had lived in the Guatemalan capital since a
peace accord that ended the country's long civil war was signed in
December 1996.
</P>
<P>
   He died of a heart attack, associates said.
</P>
<P>
   At his death, Ramirez was secretary-general of a left-wing party
that the former guerrilla coalition, the Guatemalan National
Revolutionary Unit, was organizing.
</P>
<P>
   Along with fellow rebels who had taken the aliases Carlos
Gonzalez, Gaspar Ilom and Pablo Monsanto, Ramirez had been part of
the general command of the guerrilla group since its founding and
was regarded as its dominant and perhaps most flexible figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``His contributions to the revolutionary struggle and the peace
process were extremely valuable,'' Jorge Soto, who had been known
as Monsanto, said at a news conference on Saturday, when the death
was confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   President Alvaro Arzu Irigoyen, who visited Ramirez's wife to
pay his respects, and other officials also praised the leader for
his role in helping end the 36-year conflict that resulted in the
deaths of more than 100,000 Guatemalans.
</P>
<P>
   The accord that Ramirez helped broker included measures intended
to protect the rights and culture of the poor Mayan Indian majority
and bring them into national life, as well as provisions for land
and other social changes.
</P>
<P>
   Progress has been slower than desired. But Guatemalans have
welcomed the cessation of organized violence and the prospect of
real democratic change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of Rolando Moran, Guatemala is a society transformed
for the better,'' said Jennifer Schirmer, an expert on the
Guatemalan peace effort who teaches at Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez, son of an army colonel, was attracted to radical
politics early, joining student revolutionary groups and labor
unions while a teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   He enthusiastically supported the left-leaning government of
Jacobo Arbenz, and, after an American-sponsored military coup
overthrew that government in 1954, Ramirez moved even further left.
</P>
<P>
   By the early '60s, inspired by Fidel Castro's success in Cuba
and mounting repression in Guatemala, he had taken up arms.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, he helped organize the Guerrilla Army of the Poor,
which soon became the largest of Guatemala's four separate _ and
sometimes quarreling _ left-wing rebel factions.
</P>
<P>
   As the writer Jorge Castaneda noted in his book ``Utopia
Unarmed,'' Ramirez's group was distinguished by its ``strong
emphasis on the Indian factor in Guatemalan politics and society.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez argued that ``the ethnic-national struggle'' was just as
important as the class struggle that orthodox Marxists stressed. He
spent much of that era in exile.
</P>
<P>
   An offensive by the group in 1980 and 1981 was a failure and was
answered by a military onslaught that led to the deaths of
thousands of Mayans. In January 1982, the guerrilla groups, facing
extinction, put aside their ideological and strategic differences
to forge their coalition, which continued to fight throughout the
'80s.
</P>
<P>
   By 1990, it was becoming evident that, just as in the case of
similar wars in neighboring El Salvador and Nicaragua, only a
negotiated settlement could end the war. Ramirez endorsed that
view, counseling patience when prospects for peace appeared darkest
and often offering compromises to keep the talks moving.
</P>
<P>
   ``Objectives vary according to historical circumstance,'' he
said in an interview with The New York Times in July 1996. ``We
have proclaimed the political struggle as the means to revolution
because we recognize that armed struggle is no longer feasible.''
</P>
<P>
   As a child, Ramirez contracted tuberculosis and lost a lung to
the disease. As a result, his health had been fragile for many
years.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, he was admitted to a hospital for unspecified
surgery. The operation caused internal bleeding, which led to the
fatal heart attack, political associates said.
</P>
<P>
   Surviving are his wife, three sons, and four grandchildren.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Sure, a certain document dealing with such matters as furtive
White House meetings and a dress from the Gap was the most talked
about publication in America this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   But another, mustier, if more venerable, volume was also getting
substantial attention: The Federalist papers, the collection of
articles published by Alexander Hamilton, John Jay and James
Madison in 1787 and 1788 to make their case for the adoption of the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The Federalist articles, in addition to their many other
contributions, amplified the bare description in the Constitution
that the president, vice president and other officials could be
``removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction of,
treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday and Saturday, President Clinton's lawyers cited The
Federalist liberally in their rebuttals to the report of Whitewater
independent counsel Kenneth Starr to support their argument that
the Founders intended impeachment as a penalty for official, not
personal, misdeeds. And legal experts from coast to coast were
reading dog-eared copies to reporters through the weekend, much as
they did in the Watergate era, to try to put some meat on the
exceedingly bare bones of the Impeachment Clause.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Gerhardt, an impeachment expert and a professor at the
College of William and Mary School of Law in Williamsburg, Va.,
acknowledged in an interview that The Federalist does not usually
receive quite this much attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say that it does,'' Professor Gerhardt said. ``It
would be nice to see more people familiar with the contents of The
Federalist papers. But this is a constitutional process and at
these times we concern ourselves with questions of the
Constitution's meaning, and The Federalist is one of the great
sources that sheds light on constitutional meaning.''
</P>
<P>
   The Federalist, most experts quickly noted, does not, of course,
answer the precise question of today: Is a president subject to
impeachment for the disastrous after-effects of an affair with a
White House intern?
</P>
<P>
   Many American newspapers quoted the portions of The Federalist
cited by the president's lawyers in recent days and the
200-year-old articles were mentioned on television and the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton was center stage again. Those charged with conducting
impeachment proceedings in a democracy had a tough assignment, he
counseled in an article first published in The New York Packet on
March 7, 1788. ``A well-constituted court for the trial of
impeachments is an object not more to be desired than difficult to
be obtained in a government wholly elective,'' he said in the
Federalist, No. 65.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years there may have been no more vivid verification
of Hamilton's insight than the stricken looks this weekend on the
faces of members of the House, which, under the Constitution, is
designated to vote on impeachment and in the Senate, whose members
are supposed to hear the case.
</P>
<P>
   The White House noted assertively that back in 1788, Hamilton
went on to say that impeachment is intended ``for those offenses
which proceed from the misconduct of public men, or, in other
words, from the abuse or violation of some public trust.'' Hamilton
went on to say, ``They are of a nature which may with peculiar
propriety be denominated POLTICIAL (sic), as they relate chiefly to
injuries done immediately to society itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton's capitalization of political, more than one legal
commentator noted, signified that the Founders meant impeachment to
deal with official misdeeds of a high order, not with petty
squabbles.
</P>
<P>
   Or sex scandals involving assertions of perjury, obstruction of
justice and abuse of power? Hamilton was silent on a point, for a
change.
</P>
<P>
   But he made it clear (in the Federalist, No. 69) that he and his
colleagues did anticipate the possibility that an impeachment
proceeding might embarrass the chief executive. One difference
between the president and the British King, he noted, was ``the one
would be amenable to personal punishment and disgrace; the person
of the other is sacred and inviolable.''
</P>
<P>
   The Federalist pulled no punches when predicting that
proceedings to remove office holders in a Republic are likely to be
painful and divisive for the entire country. That was only to be
expected of an impeachment, Hamilton said. ``Is it not designed,''
he asked his readers, ``as a method of NATIONAL INQUEST into the
conduct of public men?''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever else the Federalist has contributed to the debate about
Clinton, some of the experts suggested, it hit the nail on the head
with that description that an inquiry into the conduct of a
president would amount to nothing less than a national inquest,
which, even without its letters capitalized, sounds like a grave
process.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton described the final judgment in impeachment
proceedings, in momentous terms: ``to doom, to honor or to infamy
the most confidential and the most distinguished characters of the
community.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerhardt, the impeachment expert, said he was heartened by the
popularity of the Federalist in recent days. ``This is what should
be going on,'' he said. ``People should not be concerned with
reading the tea leaves of partisan politics, but should be trying
to grope with the deeper questions of constitutional meaning.''
</P>
<P>
   But he did not predict that the popularity of the Federalist
would quite equal that of the independent counsel's report.

STRATEGIES SET IN MICROSOFT ANTITRUST CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After nearly a year of testimony, acrimony and
debate, the opposing parties in the antitrust suit against
Microsoft Corp. appear to have settled on strategies for the trial
that begins in a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   For Microsoft _ accused of bullying competitors, bribing allies
and forcing customers to use the company's products, like them or
not _ one general defense has come down to this: So what? Everyone
does it. That is how business operates.
</P>
<P>
   As John Warden, a Microsoft lawyer, put it: ``All companies
compete; that's how the market works.''
</P>
<P>
   But lawyers for the Justice Department and 20 state attorneys
general who filed the landmark lawsuit against the software giant
four months ago predict that Microsoft's own leaders will prove the
government's case. In hundreds of e-mail messages and memorandums
written over the last several years, most of which will be entered
as evidence, these executives unabashedly laid out their plans and
intentions.
</P>
<P>
   What the documents show, said David Boies, a Justice Department
lawyer, is that Microsoft ``bribed people to take their products,
used predatory pricing and other anti-competitive tactics.''
</P>
<P>
   If every company behaves this way, as Microsoft asserts, ``then
we're going to be very busy'' in the coming years, one antitrust
official remarked.
</P>
<P>
   In a court hearing on Friday, Microsoft argued once again that
the government's case was baseless and asked Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson of the U.S. District Court to spare the nation the cost and
discomfort of a long trial by dismissing the case right away.
</P>
<P>
   The judge did not rule on that motion, though he indicated even
before it was filed that he was not inclined to grant it. He did
agree to Microsoft's request to delay the trial, which had been
scheduled to begin on Sept. 23, until Oct. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft lawyers had complained that without more time they
could not respond to new evidence the government has gathered.
</P>
<P>
   As the two sides offered their competing strategies on Friday,
Jackson seemed equally willing to challenge both.
</P>
<P>
   For example, one part of the government's suit accuses Microsoft
of requiring Internet service providers to support Internet
Explorer, Microsoft's browser for navigating the World Wide Web, in
exchange for receiving promotional space on a part of the main
Windows screen known as the channel bar.
</P>
<P>
   ``If your browser is so good, why do you need all those
covenants anyway?'' Jackson asked.
</P>
<P>
   Warden, the Microsoft lawyer, responded that the arrangements
were simply ``promotional marketing agreements, very common tools
of competition, just like Pepsi makes a deal with Pizza Hut to
feature Pepsi exclusively.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge responded that such marketing arrangements did not
exist in the computer industry until Microsoft introduced them.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Coca-Cola certainly does it,'' Warden said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, but Coke is not a monopoly,'' the judge answered. As he
had noted earlier, the rules governing how a monopolist can behave
are very different from those governing other companies.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson seemed skeptical at times of the government's position,
too. Stephen Houck, an assistant attorney general from New York,
read from several internal memos and documents that the government
has introduced as evidence. One was a note that an employee sent to
Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman, in March 1997 suggesting ways to
increase use of Internet Explorer and take customers away from
Netscape Communications Corp., the company's main competitor in the
Web browser market.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a mistake not to bundle Internet Explorer with
Windows,'' Microsoft's operating system, the employee wrote. ``If
we take Internet Explorer away from the operating system, Netscape
users won't switch to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson then said rhetorically: ``These documents are not
necessarily inconsistent with the behavior of a competitor.'' To
that, Houck responded: ``No, it is inconsistent to use your
monopoly position in operating systems to gain market share and
disadvantage competitors.''
</P>
<P>
   Trying to reinforce that point, Houck then read from another
memo, dated January 1996, describing a meeting between Gates and
Stephen Case, chairman of America Online, the online service. Gates
was trying to work out an arrangement under which America Online
would feature Internet Explorer, not Netscape, in exchange for
Microsoft's promoting America Online on the Windows main screen,
the desktop.
</P>
<P>
   A Microsoft employee taking notes at the meeting, Houck
reported, wrote that Case told Gates that ``Internet Explorer was
technically behind Netscape, but it's in the ballpark.'' So, Case
agreed to the arrangement, which is still in place today.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson is expected to rule sometime next week on the motion for
immediate dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   As Boies completed the government's response to this motion, he
was philosophical.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no basis for a summary judgment,'' he told the judge.
``But I suppose this has served some purpose. It allowed us to tell
you what we think our case is about.''

<P>
   POOLESVILLE, Md. _ By the time the food stalls and souvenir
stands were up and running here this weekend for the annual
Poolesville street fair, the contents of the Starr report were old
news to residents of this little suburban village 25 miles
northwest of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   To hear most fairgoers talk, after learning what was in the
report on Friday, they concluded there was more lewdness than news
_ and little they could do about the report, anyway. And so, they
said, they turned the issue off late that night, along with the 10
o'clock news.
</P>
<P>
   No, many insisted, it really didn't come up the next morning
over breakfast or later down at the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should it?'' asked Alex Viessmann, a retired Navy captain,
as he waited for the big Main Street parade to begin.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's really nothing new to say after all these endless
months of Clinton-Starr, Clinton-Starr, Clinton-Starr,'' he went
on. ``We're all just more disgusted, more disappointed and more
frustrated than ever. Besides, it's out of our hands now, up to
Congress from here on out.''
</P>
<P>
   But, of course, the issue isn't entirely up to Congress, given
the way Congress reacts to public opinion. And, try as they might,
the people of Poolesville did not turn Clinton-Starr off on Friday
night with the flick of a button.
</P>
<P>
   They still have plenty of opinions about what should be done,
almost as many opinions as there are people in Poolesville, it
sometimes seems. Beneath all the chatter at the street fair about
snow cones, pony rides and McGwire-Sosa, Clinton-Starr still nagged
_ still nags _ the people of Poolesville, stubborn as a summer cold
and a lot more painful.
</P>
<P>
   Like so many other Americans, they are bone weary of
Clinton-Starr and many, if not most, are talked out on the issue or
find it just too uncomfortable to talk about, even in the turbulent
wake of the Starr report. But once they start talking. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I want him out of there, just can't stand the man,''
Viessmann, an independent who mostly votes Republican, said a few
moments after insisting the fate of President Clinton had shifted
away from places like Poolesville and now rested solely in the
hands of Congress. ``He can resign, which I don't anticipate, or he
can be impeached. But he's hurt and embarrassed this country and
he's got to go.''
</P>
<P>
   John Cooper, a Cub Scout leader and a Democrat who voted for
Clinton, had a more benign take on the issue, though he was no less
concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true that the country has been terribly hurt by all
this,'' he said as he struggled to get his squirming blue-clad pack
assembled for the parade. ``Even these little guys I've got here
know something terrible has gone wrong. But it won't help the
country any if Clinton resigns or is impeached. That is a struggle
that will only make things worse. What he's done is inexcusable,
but it isn't resignation or impeachable stuff. What I say is that,
now that it's all been aired, let's push on.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda Trusilo, a school teacher who votes Republican, said that
Clinton should resign because he had failed as a leader, not
politically but morally.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way I can teach kids to be good citizens when the
biggest example-setter of all does things that have grammar
schoolchildren making jokes about cigars,'' she said, with hurt in
her voice.
</P>
<P>
   And if Clinton did not resign?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, Lord,'' she replied, frustration replacing hurt. ``I don't
know. Impeachment? I don't know. That's mighty hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere in the middle of all of this was Pat Michaels, a
travel company operator.
</P>
<P>
   Spotting Rep. Constance Morella, a Republican whose
congressional district includes Poolesville, working the fair
crowd, he rushed to her side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to ask one thing,'' he said, frustration in his
voice. ``For God's sake, get us out of this mess.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Morella, seeking votes for reelection to a seventh term in
a district that is more Democratic than Republican, said she would
do all she could. But she was otherwise non-commital.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be very careful about this,'' she explained. ``I'm
not going to commit to anything until we've studied all aspects.
But I will say this: I don't want any of my grandchildren reading
Mr. Starr's report.''
</P>
<P>
   Sylvia Vanwerthoven, a computer service company owner, said she
was disgusted with both the President and Kenneth Starr, the
independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Abuse of power,'' she mused. ``If you ask me, they're both
guilty of abuse of power. This whole mess has whirled out of
control. It should never have gone this far. I can't believe our
country has become a world stage for a multimillion-dollar sex
probe.''
</P>
<P>
   She turned to look for her husband, Philip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enough of all this,'' she said, heading off in his direction.
``Gotta catch up with the parade.'' &QL;

   A roundup of editorial comment about President Clinton:
</P>
<P>
   From The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Saturday, Sept. 12:
</P>
<P>
   A president more concerned with the national interest than his
own self-preservation would realize that resignation is his only
responsible option.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, Bill Clinton has shown himself incapable of such
sacrifice. He is a complex man with many attractive qualities, but
in the end his character has been defined by his crass selfishness.
It is that trait _ perjury and adultery are merely its symptoms _
that has rendered him unfit to continue as president.
</P>
<P>
   From The Charlotte Observer, Saturday, Sept. 12:
</P>
<P>
   The nation is not endangered by having Bill Clinton in the White
House. Our economy is not collapsing, we're not under attack,
there's no threat of a coup. Surely the worst that can be said of
him has been said. He continues to exercise the powers of office,
and did so rather well in Ireland and Russia. There is ample time
for Congress to consider Starr's report and to receive a detailed
reply from Clinton, then decide what course to pursue.
</P>
<P>
   Removal of a president from office, by the impeachment process
or by forced resignation, is a grave action. The notion that
presidents should be removed or resign because of public outrage or
unpopularity is foreign to our system.
</P>
<P>
   From The Boston Herald, Saturday, Sept. 12:
</P>
<P>
   During ordinary times, in an ordinary election year, Congress
would recess in early October, and that has been the plan this
year. But this is no ordinary time. This report cannot and must not
be allowed to fester away at the conscience of a nation. It must be
dealt with promptly and thoroughly until there is a resolution of
the issues now before Congress.
</P>
<P>
   From The Philadelphia Inquirer, Saturday, Sept. 12:
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton should resign. He should resign because his
repeated, reckless deceits have dishonored his presidency beyond
repair. He should resign because the impeachment anguish that his
lies have invited will paralyze his administration at a time when
an anxious world looks to the White House for sure-footed
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   He should resign because, if he does not, his once-glittering
agenda of centrist change faces a devastating setback in November's
congressional elections, And those results will reflect not the
view of the American majority of the issues _ they are with him
there _ but only a weary, tragic turning away from a politics
turned sordid.
</P>
<P>
   From The Washington Post, Sunday, Sept. 13:
</P>
<P>
   The question that Congress now faces is whether the president's
public conduct warrants impeachment and removal. It is not an easy
question, and it goes to the heart of what does and does not
constitute ``high crimes and misdemeanors.'' On the one hand, the
crimes alleged are serious ones and the evidence on some is quite
strong; on the other hand, this misconduct took place in the
context of a subsequently dismissed civil case and would probably
not, in other circumstances, have been deemed worthy of
investigation or prosecution. Clinton's behavior is at the margins
of impeachability _ straddling the line that separates
disqualifying crimes from conduct that merely mars indelibly the
presidential office and the man who holds it.

<P>
   ERICKSDAHL, Texas _ Chub Richards, whose cotton farm is not far
from the Beth El Lutheran Church picnic grounds where he waited in
line for his shot at the barbecue, fried chicken and football-sized
hunks of watermelon, held out his hand with a wide grin when his
congressman, Charles Stenholm, passed by.
</P>
<P>
   ``You all been having a fun week in Washington?'' Richards
asked.
</P>
<P>
   The 10-term Democratic congressman grimaced. ``Let me put it
this way,'' Stenholm said. ``I'm planning to have fun for the next
two hours.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the first Saturday after Labor Day, which, in the 17th
Congressional District of Texas, means that it is time for Funday,
the bash for constituents that Stenholm has been holding every year
since he was elected to Congress in 1978. About 1,000 people turned
up, despite glowering skies.
</P>
<P>
   Coming this year the day after the report by the independent
counsel, Kenneth Starr, was made public, it was inevitable that the
trials of Washington would find their way into this shady elm grove
40 miles north of Abilene.
</P>
<P>
   Stenholm said he had heard from a lot of ``frustrated and
irritated'' constituents since he arrived back in the district this
weekend, both at Funday and earlier, at a parade in Abilene. But he
said he had detected little enthusiasm for impeachment, and still
felt that those who wanted the president to resign were in the
minority. The overwhelming sentiment, he said, was for Washington
to find some way to get the mess over with.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are three elements to this,'' Stenholm said. ``The
moral, the political and the legal. On the moral side, there is no
question. What the president has already admitted to is repulsive,
disgusting, all the words that have been used to describe it. That
kind of behavior should not be tolerated.''
</P>
<P>
   But it would be wrong to overlook the political side of the
scandal, he said, because some elements of the Republican Party
hope to use it to cripple the remainder of the president's term,
defeat Democrats in November and spur the election of a Republican
president in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The political side of this is going to get meaner and uglier
by the day,'' Stenholm said.
</P>
<P>
   Which leaves the legal side of the crisis, he said, and that is
where the answer lies. Stenholm said he was convinced by what he
read in the Starr report that there were grounds for asking the
House Judiciary Committee to open investigations this week into the
possible impeachment of the president. He said he would vote for
that but intended to keep an open mind about whether to eventually
vote a bill of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have sworn to uphold the Constitution of the United
States,'' Stenholm said. ``And I believe that no president, no
county judge, no congressman, nobody is above the law. I think most
people just want the legal side to work itself out.''
</P>
<P>
   Richards was sitting on a hay bale, working his way through a
chicken breast, while the Cooper Fiddlers were giving ``Yellow Rose
of Texas'' a pretty good ride from the makeshift stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sad day for the United States,'' Richards said.
``Personally, I think the president should dismiss himself from his
position. I mean he should resign. There is no way he can be
effective anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Norris Lineweaver, a retired postman from Abilene, could not
disagree more.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole thing is the worst example of negative politics
that I have ever seen, the way the Republicans are handling it,''
Lineweaver said. ``And that report, I couldn't even read it. You
can go to the pornographic place over in Merckel and pick up all of
that stuff you want. You can't defend what Clinton did, but this
whole thing is just a political lynching.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Wills, a financial planner from San Angelo, laughed when
asked whether she had read the Starr report. ``Like, hello?'' she
said. ``Of course, I read every sordid and steamy little detail.''
</P>
<P>
   And? Ms. Wills shrugged. ``It didn't bother me that much,'' she
said. ``I guess I'm just a child of the '60s.''
</P>
<P>
   Stenholm, a fiscal conservative, did not even face Republican
opposition in six elections, from 1980 to 1990. But recent
elections have grown more competitive, and this year, he faces a
rematch with an Abilene dentist and businessman, Rudy Izzard, who
held Stenholm to 52 percent of the vote in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure they're going to try to use the Clinton scandal
against me,'' Stenholm said. ``They'll try to tie me to the
president. That's OK. We'll tie my opponent to Newt Gingrich. Newt
is about as unpopular here as the president is.'' &QL;

IN SEATTLE`S SUBURBS, FEW CALLS FOR PRESIDENT'S IMPEACHMENT 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   KIRKLAND, Wash. _ Perhaps Rep. Rick White's constituents were in
a forgiving mood this weekend because the Seattle area was bathed
in sparkling late-summer sunshine. Maybe it was because much of the
congressman's flesh-pressing on Sunday was done amid jovial fans
assembled at a park-and-ride station for a trip to the Kingdome to
watch the Seahawks, the pro football team whom many Seattleites
believe may actually make the playoffs this year.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reasons, there were strikingly few calls for the
impeachment of President Clinton as White, a Republican running for
re-election, made the rounds of his district, which takes in many
of the northern and eastern suburbs curling around Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's kind of sad what he's done, but it's really none
of our business,'' said Dennis Pappas as he climbed aboard a bus
with his wife, Janice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wrong but not impeachable,'' was how Pappas, a 55-year-old
inventory planner for the Boeing Co., summarized the president's
behavior. Added Mrs. Pappas: ``Yes, it's between him and Hillary. I
think the rest of us should get on and get over it.''
</P>
<P>
   Others were far more adamant in their defense of the president.
``The man's done a great job in the office that we elected him
to,'' said Lynann Bradbury, 35, who works for a local
public-relations firm and who said she was angry at Kenneth Starr,
the independent counsel, for releasing such a sexually graphic
report about what she saw as a private encounter.
</P>
<P>
   ``My question,'' said Ms. Bradbury, ``is, are we really better
off as a country knowing all this?''
</P>
<P>
   Many people, to be sure, used words like ``sickening,''
``disgusting,'' and ``pathetic'' to describe the president's
relationship with a White House intern, and a few said the proper
moral response was for him to resign. Others said the Congress
should censure the president to register its disapproval, and one
man suggested the president be made to pay a fine since, in his
view, Clinton was unlikely to be swayed by condemnatory words
alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's got to be some sanction in some way,'' said the
proponent of the monetary penalty, Randy Harlow, 36, of Seattle.
``If you just allow him to get away scot-free, you're setting a
precedent for years and years to come.''
</P>
<P>
   But pressed on whether the president should be impeached for
what Starr depicts as his perjury over the affair, very few of the
people White encountered on his campaign rounds said yes.
</P>
<P>
   No such crowd is scientifically representative of the population
at large. Still, at the park-and-ride station this morning, a
reporter conducting random interviews for an hour could not find
anyone favoring impeachment until, at last, he called out to the
crowd, specifically seeking those who favored the action. Then
there were takers, but not a lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely, impeach him,'' volunteered Michael Wallace, 41, a
mail clerk for a Seattle bank, weighted down with Seahawks
paraphernalia. ``For what he did, for how he lied about, for how
he's really not at all contrite, and for a lot of other things too.
I say get rid of him.''
</P>
<P>
   White, one of six Republicans elected to Congress from
Washington state in the party's takeover surge in 1994, said that
few people had specifically brought up the Clinton matter with him
as he approached them to ask for their vote in Tuesday's primary
and to see what was on their minds.
</P>
<P>
   But, in the view of the congressman, who said he had not made up
his mind on whether the House should vote for impeachment, this did
not mean that people weren't deeply bothered by the accusations
against the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people would really prefer it went away, but I think
they know it really can't, and I think we all feel about the same
way,'' said White. ``These are very serious allegations. Even the
president admits his behavior was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   White's district is not viewed as safe for either party _ in
fact, it is chiefly known as a tough one for incumbents to hang
onto. He is in a tough re-election fight against a former
Democratic congressman, Jay Inslee, who lost his seat in another
Washington district in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   But while the congressman says he is undergoing a sort of
``osmosis'' to ascertain how people in his district feel about
moves such as censure or impeachment, it seemed clear on Sunday
that many people wished for other options as they mulled over the
president's situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he should consider resigning, but the thing that
really bother me is that he obviously has no intention of that, it
hasn't even crossed his mind,'' said Richard Jayne, an insurance
broker headed off for the game with his sons, Richie and David.
</P>
<P>
   But even Jayne, a confirmed Clinton critic, said he wasn't sure
about impeachment. He said he was bothered that prosecutors had not
yet assembled a case about ``Whitewater, the China campaign stuff,
Filegate'' and other matters he considered more important than the
president's affair with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Many people just seemed downright blase about the whole matter.
``Look, it was a stupid thing,'' Janice McCall, who sells
advertising for the local Yellow Pages, said of the president's
trysts. ``But men have been doing it for millions of years. Women,
too for that matter.''

<P>
   WORCESTER, Mass. _ Most Democratic candidates can't do enough to
distance themselves from President Clinton. But not Jim McGovern.
Last month the freshman congressman from Massachusetts made
national headlines _ and took what pundits and his Republican
opponent called a big political risk _ when he welcomed the
president to his hometown just days after his grudging and
ill-received admission of his involvement with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   And out on the campaign trail here Sunday, McGovern was making
no secret of where he had been on Friday night. ``I was at the
White House last night with the president and first lady,'' he told
the small group of voters gathered in a living room in Paxton, a
suburb of this working-class, Democratic stronghold. McGovern said
he had been attending an event honoring the president's efforts in
bringing peace to Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, from a pancake breakfast in Sterling to a
clambake at the East Side Improvement Club here to a barbecue given
by the fire department in suburban Grafton _ home of McGovern's
opponent, state Sen. Matthew Amorello _ McGovern made it clear that
he was disappointed with the president's behavior in the Lewinsky
matter. But that was not what he _ or his constituents, for the
most part _ wanted most to discuss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Notwithstanding the fact that you can't pick up a newspaper
and not read about scandals, there's a lot more to the government
than scandal,'' McGovern, 38, told voters in the living room of
Denis Crowley, a retired soft drink executive. ``Republicans in the
Senate the other day killed campaign finance reform, and yet you'd
need a magnifying glass to find that out. If people want to be
outraged about something, morally indignant about something, they
should be outraged about that.''
</P>
<P>
   McGovern got his start in politics 20 years as an intern in the
Washington office of George McGovern (no relation), whose
presidential candidacy carried only one state, Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   But not surprisingly, on a day when the Worcester Telegram and
Gazette, like newspapers across the country, had published the
Starr report, the first question for the candidate was not about
Social Security, or Medicare, or home health care, or public
education, or the environment, or any of the other issues McGovern
said he wanted to discuss.
</P>
<P>
   The first question was this: ``Do you think they're going to
impeach him?'' But it was asked with real concern, not the
political speculation and odds-making that fill the television
airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   McGovern answered that he hoped not, but that he would be
surprised if there were not hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Shirley Weinstein, a retired social worker and Democrat, wanted
to know what impact the Starr report would have on Democrats in the
coming elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not the impact the news media makes you think,'' McGovern
replied. ``If I hear Sam and Cokie tell me one more time, `You're
done,' I'll scream.''
</P>
<P>
   McGovern was referring to Sam Donaldson and Cokie Roberts, the
ABC television commentators, who have been forecasting gloomy odds
for Democrats in the upcoming elections.
</P>
<P>
   The voters along McGovern's route Sunday indicated that they,
too, are fed up with the media. ``The media are definitely blowing
this thing up,'' said Dave Urella, 44, a field engineer for Wang
Laboratories, referring to the Starr report. ``If they decide to
impeach, it's ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, to follow McGovern around was to experience a disconnect
between the media that is saturated with news of the Starr report,
as well as impeachment, and the citizens. While they expressed
concern about what might happen next, and disappointment, and even
outrage, over Clinton's conduct, most of the voters were hardly
obsessed with the report, or even very focused on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big issue in America isn't Bill Clinton's sex life,'' said
Chet Jakubiak, 53, a social worker and Democrat. ``It's Social
Security reform, health insurance for the uninsured, job security,
education reform.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Over barbecued chicken in Grafton, Judy Read, 32, a nurse and
registered Independent, expressed similar concerns. ``We have
bombings,'' she said. ``We have terrorism, kids killing each other
in schools, so many other problems. To spend this amount of time on
this is just deplorable.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Mrs. Read added: ``I've had it with Bill
Clinton. I'm starting to think he's a pretty sneaky guy.''
</P>
<P>
   No one in the national press paid much attention to McGovern's
race until last month, when Clinton unexpectedly telephoned to ask
if his earlier invitation to visit Worcester still stood, and
McGovern said that it did. The visit was a success, with the
president addressing a packed hall of cheering supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was proud that he came here,'' McGovern said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Beneath the public vitriol at the White House about
Kenneth Starr's ``hit-and-run smear campaign,'' President Clinton's
supporters and advisers are moving toward a consensus that Congress
will accept nothing less than a censure of the president.
</P>
<P>
   Few advisers to Clinton say they think he can escape the
Lewinsky scandal without some sort of punishment. They argue that
censure might be the most politically palatable course because it
would satisfy the competing demands of Americans who, judging by
polls conducted this weekend, think Clinton should be rebuked but
also want the nation to move beyond the scandal. But the advisers'
fundamental interest in this option is that it would spare the
president from impeachment proceedings that could force him from
office.
</P>
<P>
   But there are no signs that censure holds any appeal to
Republicans _ now.
</P>
<P>
   In the short term, an unresolved scandal appears to be an asset
for November's elections. They see no reason to hurry, especially
with public reaction still forming and 37 boxes of evidence still
sealed.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the uncertainty is that the House Judiciary Committee,
which would take up an impeachment inquiry, is not known for
compromise. It is perhaps the most polarized committee in the
House, and it lacks a core of moderates that helped the panel
function smoothly during the Watergate hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Still, given that in this scandal the political dynamics are
often confounding and always shifting, Republicans concede that an
accommodation over a punishment short of impeachment is possible in
the longer term. That could happen if Republicans feel intense
pressure from their constituents that the country must move beyond
the Lewinsky matter, or if Democrats successfully frame the drive
for impeachment as a partisan witch hunt.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, Democrats do not see any easy way out, and
Republicans are enjoying their discomfort as they navigate between
voters who think the Lewinsky scandal is overblown and those who
are appalled by Clinton's conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., who is a member of the
Congressional Black Caucus, said ``censure is a possibility.'' He
explained: ``My constituents are in a bind. They hate the
president's conduct, but they love him.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are in no hurry. ``It's not our problem, and the
Republicans shouldn't feel a big need to settle this,'' said Scott
Reed, a former executive director of the Republican Party who ran
Bob Dole's unsuccessful campaign against Clinton in 1996. ``The
climate is great in the House races, the Senate races and most of
the governors races. For them, censure is the easy way out.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason Republicans are reluctant to entertain the censure
idea is they say they are not about to prematurely halt an
impeachment inquiry before the public has a chance to fully digest
Starr's report _ and given the possibility of new revelations
coming from the independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ``To make some quick, interim judgment would short-circuit the
process,'' said Rep. Michael Forbes, R-N.Y. ``That doesn't seem to
be an option on table.''
</P>
<P>
   A well-connected lobbyist with extensive contacts on Capitol
Hill and in the White House, said, ``People on the Hill are just
deathly afraid of giving him a break on censure and then finding
out something else.'' The lobbyist, speaking on the condition of
anonymity, also said there was some nervousness in the White House
as well about censure because ``no one is sure the president would
go for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all the chatter among Democrats about censure, Sen.
Trent Lott, R-Miss., turned up the pressure by suggesting Sunday
that the president consider resigning. But beneath the bravado,
Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who is chairman of the Judiciary
Committee, Sunday opened the door to something short of impeachment
or resignation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no doubt there will be a sanction, the question is
what,'' Hatch said. ``And it could go all the way down from
impeachment to censure, condemnation, rebuke or whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest polls show that the censure option is popular among
Americans but also that people have also grown weary of the
scandal. Impeachment is a drawn-out process that calls for the
House to hold hearings and then vote on impeachment; the next step
would be a trial on the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   In a CBS News Poll conducted Saturday night, 56 percent of
Americans said Congress should censure Clinton. On another
question, about what should happen now, the poll found that 26
percent said Clinton should resign, 10 percent said Congress should
begin impeachment proceedings, and 57 percent said the matter
should be dropped. The nationwide survey of 680 adults has a margin
of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David Skaggs, D-Colo., said he was open to the idea of a
censure and he offered two reasons why Republicans might be
amenable.
</P>
<P>
   ``For those Republicans who view this soberly, not just partisan
angle-playing, do the offenses in the Starr report really reach the
level of gravity that we use the Constitutional equivalent of an
atomic device to get at?'' Skaggs asked. He also argued that
Republicans want Clinton to serve out his term because ``most
Republicans don't wish to give Al Gore a head start on the year
2000'' if he were to be elevated to the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans may also find that they can seize on the censure
option to burnish their party's image. If, in the end, Republicans
overwhelmingly favor impeachment but few Democrats are willing to
go along with them, Republicans could choose to broker a compromise
_ some might call it a political plea bargain _ rather than coming
across as bitter and partisan.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their increasing talk of censure _ a punishment meted
only to one president, Andrew Jackson, more than a century ago _
several Democrats said it was impossible to predict whether, or
how, a deal could be reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conventional wisdom is racing there at a very fast
speed,'' a senior White House official, speaking on the condition
of anonymity, said of censure. ``I just don't know how the whole
censure thing is going to play out. It's very uncharted waters.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, now that the Lewinsky matter is in the hands of
Congress, it is far from clear that Clinton and his advisers can
wield much influence, even among Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Another close aide to the president put it this way: ``Our clout
right now is rather limited on this. Wouldn't you say?'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   From the pages of the Starr report, the many faces of Bill
Clinton shine in succession.
</P>
<P>
   There is the mental facility that lets the president finish
crossword puzzles in ink in minutes and, Monica Lewinsky says,
enabled him to recite her telephone numbers from memory after a few
encounters. There is the seductive charm that has melted supporters
for three decades and led him to ply Ms. Lewinsky with ``Leaves of
Grass.'' And there is the casual exploitation of subordinates that
has left his presidency littered with old friends before grand
juries or in jail and turned his loyal secretary, Betty Currie,
into a surreptitious accomplice, spiriting Ms. Lewinsky into
meetings behind the backs of disapproving colleagues and keeping
her phone calls secret.
</P>
<P>
   There is the uncanny blend of self-destructive behavior and
self-preserving instincts that led him to embark on an illicit
affair with Ms. Lewinsky, then an intern, and then custom-tailor
alibis to convince his senior aides that he had not. There is the
needy streak that makes Clinton assume the pose of perpetual victim
of actions by others and made him, Ms. Lewinsky says, bemoan her
transfer from the White House by complaining: ``Why do they have to
take you away from me?''
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, there is Clinton's own propensity for shaving the
English language as fine as a Tuscan truffle. All the president's
past parsings of the truth, from the draft and military service, to
``I didn't inhale,'' at once presage _ and yet pale beside _ his
sworn contention to a grand jury that ``most ordinary Americans''
would subscribe to his view that there can be no sexual
relationship without sexual intercourse, regardless of what other
sexual activities occur.
</P>
<P>
   More than perhaps any sitting president in history, Bill Clinton
has already been psychoanalyzed, fictionalized and vivisected in a
score of serious books and a best-selling novel that chronicled his
outsized talents and his outsized flaws. When even a president's
underwear preferences are known, what else can be left to tell? A
lot, and very little, as it turns out.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1997, long after the thrill of their relationship had
subsided into mutual recriminations and the fear of disclosure and
discovery, the president telephoned Ms. Lewinsky in the middle of
the night and told her tersely: ``If I'd known what kind of a
person you really were, I wouldn't have gotten involved with you,''
Ms. Lewinsky told investigators, adding that the president ``got so
mad at me, he must have been purple.''
</P>
<P>
   That short passage in Kenneth Starr's voluminous report rings
with unintended overtones, for in all the report's seamy reams of
largely uncontested specifics about sexual encounters, its
unchallenged testimony by senior White House aides and its
unsparing recitation of the president's own sworn struggles with
the truth, it paints a devastating _ but not particularly
surprising _ portrait of Bill Clinton's darker side.
</P>
<P>
   The president's lawyers have dismissed the report as a
``hit-and-run smear campaign,'' arguing that the offenses it lists
are personal, and Congress and the public may well decide that its
selective bill of particulars does not rise to the level of
impeachable offenses. But no one who has much firsthand experience
with Clinton could profess shock at the report's accumulated
detail, because it is replete with all-too-familiar examples of the
character traits and personal failings that have dogged this
president throughout his public life.
</P>
<P>
   In Bill Clinton's first campaign for office, in the Watergate
summer of 1974, and in his last in 1996, his aides had a flip
nickname for him that summed up his unruly, undisciplined ways:
``The Boy.'' In page after page of the Starr report, the president
of the United States is portrayed as the ward of his own worried
aides, from Evelyn Lieberman, the former deputy chief of staff who
moved Ms. Lewinsky out of the White House in 1996 because she was
spending too much time around the president, to the president's own
personal aide, Stephen Goodin, the earnest Generation Xer who
fretted that the president should not be alone with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has always been a man who wants all things, all the
time. At a White House lunch with the network news anchors early in
his first term, guests were offered a choice of chicken, fish or
meat, and the president had a bit of each. In the Starr report, and
his own rebuttals, Clinton at once insists he gravely erred in an
``inappropriate sexual relationship'' with Ms. Lewinsky, and that
his answers were ``legally accurate'' when he denied having any
``sexual relationship'' with Ms. Lewinsky in his deposition in the
Paula Jones lawsuit last January.
</P>
<P>
   The president's contention stems from his assertion that he was
no more than a passive recipient of oral sex from Ms. Lewinsky _ an
assertion that she contradicts in embarrassing detail. But the
Starr report makes clear just how thoroughly Clinton withheld even
this couched admission from his own senior aides when reports of
the relationship became public last January.
</P>
<P>
   And, as he always does, Clinton chose his words to fit his
listeners, a trait often cited in describing a man whose great
strength and weakness has been his powerful and often successful
urge to be all things to all people. His Deputy Chief of Staff John
Podesta, a lawyer with a cool eye for potential loopholes,
testified that Clinton was ``extremely explicit'' in insisting then
that he had never had even oral sex with Ms. Lewinsky. A
presidential aide, Sidney Blumenthal, a former journalist who has
discerned evidence of right-wing conspiracies against the
president, testified that Clinton claimed that he had rebuffed a
``sexual demand'' from Ms. Lewinsky and felt like a character in
the novel, ``Darkness at Noon.''
</P>
<P>
   In his grand jury testimony, Clinton flatly acknowledged being
alone with Ms. Lewinsky, but at another point, he also said,
``There were a lot of times when we were alone, but I never really
thought we were.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been Clinton's nearly unvarying pattern to make missteps
not when he is under fire, but when he is overconfident. He
followed up his 1993 victories on the budget and the North American
Free Trade Agreement with his disastrous overreach on health care
restructuring in 1994. He began his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky
not in the depths of his despair after the 1994 midterm elections
but at the beginning of his comeback, in the government shutdown in
November 1995 when he was finally beginning to put the Republicans
on the defensive.
</P>
<P>
   And for a president often accused of running the West Wing like
a college pizza party in his first term, the relationship with the
intern began in a poetically appropriate way: Ms. Lewinsky
testified that they had their second sexual encounter when she took
him pizza in the midst of the shutdown, when salaried workers were
told to stay away from the White House and interns took over many
tasks.

STATES TAKE LEAD IN HEALTH LEGISLATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By ROBERT PEAR    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ States have enacted a wide range of new laws to
define patients' rights and regulate health maintenance
organizations this year, even though similar legislation has become
bogged down in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Such proposals have generated bitter conflict in Washington, but
have attracted broad bipartisan support in many state capitals.
Indeed, Republican state legislators have supported many regulatory
initiatives opposed by Republicans in Congress. At the state level,
``patient protection'' is often seen as a form of constituent
service rather than as an occasion for ideological warfare.
</P>
<P>
   Comprehensive patient-protection laws were adopted in 10 states
this year and in 17 states last year, according to the National
Conference of State Legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   The 10 states are Alaska, Hawaii, Indiana, Kentucky, Nebraska,
New Mexico, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   The laws vary, but typically guarantee patients access to
medical specialists, require coverage of emergency services,
establish procedures for patients to appeal the denial of care and
ban ``gag clauses,'' which restrict doctors' ability to discuss
treatment options with patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all recognize that health care is not a partisan issue,''
said Patricia Vance, a Republican member of the Pennsylvania House
of Representatives, who was co-author of a comprehensive new law
regulating HMOs. ``We all have constituents who've had problems,
real or imagined, and we know that the old fee-for-service health
care system was out of control, looking too much at bottom-line
profits rather than people's problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The other author of the Pennsylvania law, state Sen. Timothy
Murphy, a Republican from the suburbs of Pittsburgh, said that
skeptics were convinced that legislation was needed after a series
of public hearings around the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We heard horror story after horror story,'' Murphy said.
``They became too moving to ignore. For example, we heard from
disabled veterans in wheelchairs who described the difficulties
they had getting access to medical specialists.''
</P>
<P>
   In Tennessee, the chief sponsor of the new law, Steve McDaniel,
is the Republican leader in the State House of Representatives. The
main co-sponsor, state Sen. Jo Ann Graves, is a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to make this a bipartisan issue,'' said McDaniel,
who owns a family restaurant in western Tennessee. Mrs. Graves
said: ``That's how we were able to forge consensus. We put the
patient first.''
</P>
<P>
   Martha Gentry, a lobbyist for the Tennessee Association of HMOs,
said: ``We had a healthy debate in Tennessee. We reached some good
compromises, which had many benefits for consumers. That puts us a
step ahead of what's going on in Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   In Congress, the House passed a comprehensive patient-protection
bill on July 24, but the outlook in the Senate is highly uncertain.
Supporters of the measure say the chances of passage have been
sharply reduced by the scandal that has engulfed Bill Clinton's
presidency, preoccupying White House officials and diminishing
Clinton's political leverage.
</P>
<P>
   While many states have passed laws to regulate HMOs in the last
six months, no state has adopted all the requirements advocated by
Clinton and Democratic leaders of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton strongly favors legislation that would make it easier
for patients to sue HMOs for the denial of benefits or medical
malpractice. Such legislation was introduced in 29 states this
year, but none of the bills has become law.
</P>
<P>
   In most of those states, insurers argued that expanding
liability for health plans would lead to an increase in costs,
prompting employers to reduce or eliminate coverage for millions of
Americans. (New Mexico does allow patients to sue HMOs for
violation of rights protected by its new law.)
</P>
<P>
   The chief sponsor of the HMO bill passed this year in South
Carolina, state Sen. Glenn McConnell, described himself as ``a
Goldwater Republican,'' who would not normally favor government
regulation.
</P>
<P>
   And he said: ``We were light-years ahead of Washington on this
issue. For the life of me, I don't understand how Congress can get
hung up in partisan gridlock on legislation that would provide more
information and more freedom of choice to consumers in the
marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   The South Carolina law, like the bills pending in Congress or
passed by other states, requires HMOs to provide consumers with
easily understood information describing benefits and costs,
including co-payments and deductibles, so people can compare health
plans.
</P>
<P>
   Under the South Carolina law, if a company provides health
insurance to employees, it must offer them the option, for an extra
charge, to use doctors outside the HMO network, without getting a
referral or prior authorization.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Gov. George Pataki said, laws enacted in the last
few years provided ``the most comprehensive patient protections in
America.''
</P>
<P>
   Under a bill signed by Pataki last month, New Yorkers may appeal
to an independent panel of medical experts if an HMO or an
insurance company denies coverage on the ground that a service is
not medically necessary. The law also makes it easier for patients
with life-threatening illnesses to obtain coverage for experimental
treatments and clinical trials.
</P>
<P>
   HMOs, insurance companies and employers of all sizes have waged
a fierce campaign against federal legislation to regulate managed
care. On the state level, by contrast, insurers have reluctantly
accepted some of the new laws.
</P>
<P>
   The author of the new law in Nebraska, state Sen. David Landis,
a Democrat, said: ``We created a forum in which consumers,
insurance companies and the director of the Insurance Department
negotiated a bill they could all agree to. They spoke directly to
one another, with me at the table as mediator and chairman.''
</P>
<P>
   Here is a summary of recent state actions:
</P>
<P>
   _ All states now require HMOs to have grievance and appeal
procedures so patients can challenge the denial of benefits. In 20
states, health plans must allow appeals to an independent panel of
medical experts outside the H.M.O. Six of those states _ Hawaii,
Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Vermont _ adopted
laws allowing such ``external appeals'' this year.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sixteen states require health plans to offer a ``point of
service'' option, allowing patients to visit doctors outside the
HMO network for an extra charge. Five states _ Alaska, Indiana,
South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia _ adopted such requirements
this year.
</P>
<P>
   _ At least 20 states prohibit HMOs from using financial
incentives to compensate doctors for ordering less care than is
medically necessary and appropriate. Alaska, Nebraska, New Mexico
and Pennsylvania adopted laws banning such incentives this year.
</P>
<P>
   _ Forty-six states now ban gag clauses. Four states _ Alaska,
Hawaii, Kentucky and South Carolina _ passed bills to outlaw such
restrictions on doctor-patient communications this year.
</P>
<P>
   _ Thirty-six states assure women that they can go directly to
obstetricians and gynecologists without a referral from another
doctor or allow women to designate such specialists as their
primary care providers. Seven of those states _ California, New
Hampshire, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah and West
Virginia _ passed such laws this year.
</P>
<P>
   _ At least 23 states require HMOs to cover emergency services
whenever ``a prudent lay person'' would consider them necessary.
Eight of those states _ Hawaii, Indiana, Kentucky, New Mexico,
Pennsylvania, South Carolina, West Virginia and Wisconsin _ passed
laws dealing with the issue this year.
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen states have laws to insure ``continuity of care'' for
pregnant women and patients with serious illnesses. Under these
laws, if an HMO drops a doctor from its network or terminates a
doctor's contract, it must allow patients to continue seeing the
doctor for a certain amount of time, typically 60 to 120 days. Five
states _ Indiana, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee and
Wisconsin _ adopted the laws this year.

PILOTS SETTLE BUT NORTHWEST'S LABOR ILLS CONTINUE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich., Minn., Tenn.)  (mk) 
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Idled employees at Northwest Airlines began returning to work
Sunday, a day after striking pilots ratified a new four-year
contract that ended the longest walkout against a major airline in
a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Moments after the 17-member Master Executive Council of the Air
Line Pilots Association approved the new contract late Saturday,
Northwest began recalling the 31,000 workers laid off during the
two-week strike, which virtually eliminated air traffic in parts of
the Midwest and South.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the airline, which is the country's fourth-largest, said
it would not be ready to resume flights until Wednesday and would
not have all its 1,700 daily flights back in the air until next
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Though the strike is over, Northwest's labor problems are not.
The airline is negotiating contracts with five other unions,
including the International Association of Machinists, which
represents 27,000 Northwest workers, and the International
Brotherhood of Teamsters, which represents the carrier's 11,000
flight attendants.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual display of unity for the airline industry, all
five unions strongly backed the pilots during the strike, and the
pilots say they plan to return the favor.
</P>
<P>
   After declaring the strike officially ended on Saturday, Steve
Zoller, chairman of the pilots' executive council, said, ``I want
to remind Northwest management that there are five other unions at
Northwest, and the job isn't done until all of us have new
contracts.''
</P>
<P>
   Such unity could prove costly for the airline. Like the pilots,
the other unions believe they are owed a substantial pay increase
to make up for the wage concessions they made in 1993 to help
Northwest avert bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rest of the unions are every bit as passionate as the
pilots are about their pensions, their health benefits and their
job security,'' said Sid Rhinehart, public affairs chairman of
local 543 of the Transport Workers union, which represents 170
Northwest flight dispatchers and operations planners.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots and Northwest had been negotiating for two years
before the walkout on Aug. 29, and there was deep mistrust on both
sides. Virtually no progress was made toward a settlement for 11
days until Bruce Lindsey, one of President Clinton's most trusted
aides, joined the negotiations last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey used the prospect of presidential intervention to
pressure both sides to compromise, said a person involved in the
negotiations who spoke only on the condition of anonymity. When the
talks bogged down early Thursday, Lindsey made it clear to the
pilots that the president would order them back to work that day if
they did not reach a deal.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides had shaken hands but were still arguing over
whether to call their agreement a tentative contract when Clinton
trumped them by announcing the agreement on national television,
the person involved in negotiations said.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots were seeking a 14 percent pay increase over three
years, a one-time payment of $86 million to make up for lost wages,
limits on how many regional jets Northwest could add to its fleet
and the phasing out of a two-tier wage scale, which pays junior
pilots a lower salary in their first five years.
</P>
<P>
   In its last offer before the strike, Northwest offered a 9
percent increase over four years, a $57 million payment, profit
sharing and a reduction of the two-tier wage scale to three years.
</P>
<P>
   The final settlement includes a 12 percent pay raise for the
pilots over four years, a lump sum of $57 million, more generous
profit sharing, 2.5 million stock options for the pilots and the
phasing out of the two-tier wage scale. The deal also links the
addition of regional jets in Northwest's fleet directly to the
expansion of the number of larger jets.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts were divided over who got the better deal.
``The kind of pressure that was put on by the White House probably
gave labor slightly more leverage than management,'' said Thomas
Schreier, an airline industry analyst at Credit Suisse First
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   But Samuel Buttrick, an analyst with Paine Webber, said in a
note to investors on Friday that management came out on top because
the threat of presidential intervention forced the pilots to relax
their demands.
</P>
<P>
   The strike will take a large financial toll on the airline.
Estimates of its costs range from $275 million to $400 million, not
counting the substantial cost of restarting the carrier. One
Northwest executive put the total at $700 million.
</P>
<P>
   The carrier said on Friday that it expected to lose money this
quarter and next, its first quarterly losses in five years. It also
faces continuing weakness in Asia, which accounts for 30 percent of
its revenues, more than any other domestic carrier.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, experts said that it would not be too
difficult for Northwest to win back its customers because it has a
virtual monopoly at the main airports in Detroit, Minneapolis and
Memphis. Once the airline is back to its full schedule, analysts
said, travelers in those regions will once again have little choice
but to fly Northwest.

<P>
   DUNDALK, Ireland _ This town 13 miles from the border with
Northern Ireland once harbored so many Irish Republican Army safe
houses, underground weapons networks and gunmen on the run that
police called it ``El Paso.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People here were very resentful of that name,'' said Kevin
Mulligan, 55, editor of the weekly Argus, ``but with time they came
to realize it wasn't too far off the mark.'' Out of a mixture of
sympathy for the plight of Catholics in the North and fear of
reprisals from vengeful local IRA men, Dundalk residents kept any
misgivings to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   When the town of Omagh was bombed on Aug. 15, killing 29 people
in the most deadly single attack of Northern Ireland's three
decades of violence, police suspected guerrillas based here, and
the residents found themselves newly stigmatized. This time they
spoke up.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're saying, and saying very strongly, is that there is
no hiding place for terrorists in this town,'' said John Woods, 57,
a Dundalk lawyer who with Mulligan and four downtown businessmen
organized a protest rally in the courthouse square. By police
count, 15,000 people showed up _ half the town's population.
</P>
<P>
   The most overused symbol in the stubbornly confrontational
politics of Northern Ireland is the line in the sand, but Dundalk,
the one-time refuge of the men of violence, may have really drawn
one. ``We are saying that this is not a part of us _ people who do
these things do not represent our community,'' said Brian O'Neill,
55, owner of a century-old family hardware business.
</P>
<P>
   Dundalk's defiant rejection of its past association with
bloodshed is being cited as an emblem of what is happening
throughout the Irish island. ``I'd be an optimistic sort of person
to begin with,'' said Woods, ``but Ireland is now united as never
before.''
</P>
<P>
   Optimism is a sudden newcomer in the North, but it is getting a
warm welcome. People are daring to put their frequently battered
faith in a political solution to the tribal conflict that has cost
more than 3,200 lives. And there are convincing signs of
cooperation in Belfast between leaders of the Catholic and
Protestant communities who have battled and shunned one another for
generations.
</P>
<P>
   Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing,
and David Trimble, leader of the Ulster Unionist Party and first
minister of the new Northern Ireland Assembly, held a face-to-face
meeting last week, the first time that leaders of the two
traditions had done so in more than 75 years.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday in Belfast, the Northern Ireland Assembly will sit for
the first time, a major step in the fulfillment of the Northern
Ireland peace settlement. Structured under a power-sharing formula,
the legislature was created by the accord negotiated over a
26-month period and concluded on Good Friday, April 10.
</P>
<P>
   Dundalk is a bustling provincial town with storefronts in lively
colors and corner pubs that ring with hearty sounds of blarney.
People driving along congested Clanbrassil Street trade friendly
banter with passers-by. Towns in the North bear legends and murals
celebrating heroes of the sectarian struggle, but the banners here
say only, ``Dundalk celebrates 40 years of tidy towns _ beauty dies
where litter lies.''
</P>
<P>
   Once a center for brewing, shoe manufacturing and building
railway rolling stock, Dundalk has shared in Ireland's new
prosperity with multinational firms like Xerox and Panasonic
locating factories here.
</P>
<P>
   Dundalk was brutally reminded of its old role in the Northern
Ireland struggle by the Omagh killings, though, when responsibility
for the bombing was claimed by renegade republican paramilitaries
called the Real IRA, organized out of here. ``Here we go again,''
O'Neill remembers thinking along with his shock and revulsion.
``Everyone's going to blame Dundalk.''
</P>
<P>
   The Real IRA, made up of former members of the IRA unhappy with
its cease-fire, viewed the peace settlement as a sellout of
republican ideals and set out to undermine it with violence.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials have identified its military leader as Michael
McKevitt, 49, a Dundalk man who once was the quartermaster general
in charge of the IRA's vast arsenal. The vice chairman of the
group's political arm, the 32-County Sovereignty Committee, is his
common-law wife, Bernadette Sands-McKevitt, 40, the sister of Bobby
Sands, a republican martyr who died in a prison hunger strike that
drew international attention.
</P>
<P>
   The McKevitts live in Blackrock, three miles out of town on
Dundalk Bay, and they run The Print Junction, a photocopying,
picture framing and souvenir shop downtown. In the days following
the bombing, people tacked protest notes onto the store door and
stood in vigil outside.
</P>
<P>
   The couple complained to a local priest that they were being
harassed and that they feared for the safety of their three
children. They have not been spotted here for the past three weeks,
and the store is shuttered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right after Omagh I was listening to one of these talk
shows,'' Mulligan said, ``and people were calling in and saying,
`We should burn the McKevitts out of their house, ostracize their
children, make a point of getting up and leaving any restaurant
they walk into.'''
</P>
<P>
   It was just that kind of behavior that placed Dundalk in the
center of the struggle with the upsurge in sectarian violence in
1969. Thousands of Catholics fled Belfast to escape Protestant
firebombings and shootings, and Dundalk took them in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were strongly sympathetic; they came down in trainloads and
we literally opened our homes to them,'' recalled Mulligan. Many of
the refugees settled in the Muirhevna Mor housing project, which is
still known as Little Belfast.
</P>
<P>
   ``But then later the IRA started to use Dundalk as a base, and
they spread the violence to the south and over the past 15 years
turned to gangsterism and rackets,'' complained Mulligan.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Eamon Collins, a former IRA gunman and author of ``Killing
Rage,'' a book detailing his disillusionment with the organization,
said that Dundalk was central to the campaign of violence in the
North. ``It was a route for moving a lot of weaponry, and it was
where lots of people could rest up when they were on the run,'' he
said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Some 300 roads and pathways crisscross the border, which winds
through the woods, pastureland and mist-shrouded hillsides of
County Louth, and there is no way to patrol it effectively. The
farmlands of the nearby Cooley Peninsula became a favorite place
for hiding IRA arms, and the organization's zealousness to protect
its weapons led to a crime that caused widespread revulsion with
the IRA here.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991 Tom Oliver, a farmer who lived with his wife and seven
young children outside the town of Carlingford, reported to police
that he had stumbled upon a cache on his property. Calling him an
informer, the IRA abducted him, tortured him and shot him dead.
</P>
<P>
   Intimidation was strongest in the politicized housing projects.
Paul O'Brennan, a 57-year-old London office worker who fled his
home in Dundalk in 1974, said he did so to remove his four sons
from IRA influence. ``It was all around, in every pub and club, and
I didn't want them getting into that stuff,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For the middle class, it was less apparent. ``I knew it was
going on, but did someone say, `Joe Bloggs there is a gunman ?'
Never,'' said O'Neill. Mulligan recalled only getting ``the odd
threat'' for something he put in his paper.
</P>
<P>
   Donal Dullaghan, 44, a community worker at the Muirhevna Mor
project, said, ``Before the bombing it was just something we always
accepted. I don't know why we accepted it, but we did. They didn't
wear berets or badges, but we knew who they were.''
</P>
<P>
   The mourners for the dead of Omagh who marched in protest
through the streets of Dundalk a week later filled three condolence
books in the town hall lobby. Many messages spoke to the special
sense of sorrow and responsibility felt here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am ashamed to be living in Dundalk,'' wrote James Miller.
``I do not want a 32-county Ireland. I want a peaceful one for my
children to grow up in.''
</P>
<P>
   In the May referendum on the peace agreement, 95 percent of the
votes in the Little Belfast housing project were for approval, a
telling sign of the community's rejection of violence. ``The whole
republican family is for peace,'' said Liam Adams, 43, chairman of
the community council. Adams, the brother of Gerry Adams, came to
Dundalk 10 years ago, the only one of the ten Adams siblings to
have left Northern Ireland for the south. ``I didn't want my
children to grow up the way I had to grow up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 1, senior members of the IRA visited the homes of
members of the Real IRA and its political committee and told them
to disband or face punishment. A week later, the seven-man military
council of the Real IRA met at an undisclosed spot near Dundalk and
declared its own cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   Collins, the former IRA regular, said it was encouraging to see
the people of Dundalk speaking out and paramilitary groups
forswearing bloodshed, but he added a cautionary note. ``People who
think that physical force republicanism is over don't know their
history,'' he warned.

 &HT;    Champagne still on ice in Atlanta as Marlins win 6-5
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ They lost the lead, lost the game, lost the chance to
clinch the division, all of which turned a champagne Sunday
afternoon to vinegar. But the Braves lost Greg Maddux too.
September, in the pain.
</P>
<P>
   The worst team in baseball, Florida's Marlins scored six times
in the last three innings off rookie relievers Odalis Perez and
Adam Butler and then weathered a furious comeback to beat the
Braves 6-5, averting a three-game sweep and leaving Atlanta's magic
number at one. This is miscellany compared to the sixth inning,
when Maddux, guarding a 1-0 lead, went back to the dugout to report
a muscle strain under his right arm pit was beginning to worry him.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's important at this time of year to look a little ahead,''
said Maddux, who came out after throwing 83 pitches and extending a
string of scoreless innings to 10. ''It might not have be best
thing (to come out) today but I'd be surprised if it doesn't turn
out to be the best thing two or three weeks from now.''
</P>
<P>
   Maddux did not think the strain would cost him a start, though
he would not rule it out. His shot at his 18th win immediately fell
apart, after Perez allowed four straight hits to the first four
batters he faced in the seventh, including a two-run double by
Derek Lee and an ensuing two-run homer by Kevin Orie. The Marlins
then went out 6-2 in the eighth with two more runs without
recording a hit after Butler hit Todd Dunwoody, walked Edgar
Renteria and then threw Mark Kotsay's sacrifice bunt down the right
field line.
</P>
<P>
   With New York's 1-0 victory in Montreal, Atlanta cannot clinch
their seventh straight divisional title until tonight, when the
Philadelphia Phillies open a three-game series at Turner Field.
Though the champagne was chilled in a clubhouse back closet, the
Mets' victory was hardly acknowledged after assistant general
manager Dean Taylor confirmed it with a score pager.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think you would have seen too much of a celebration,''
said Chipper Jones. ''We're on the verge of going on a nice little
streak here and all of a sudden, you get smacked in the face.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Williams hit his third homer in three games in the fourth
and Andruw Jones hit his 30th in the seven, making the Braves the
sixth team in major league history with four players reaching 30 or
more. In the eighth, they strung together three hits and a walk to
score three and close to within one. But with the tying run at
third, Tony Graffanino struck out against Vic Darensbourg to end
the comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Mired in a 5-7 September, having just gone 3-3 against the dregs
of the NL East, the Braves seemed to have lost any sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   ''I still believe we got the best team,'' said Andres Galarraga.
''I don't care what anybody thinks. It doesn't matter if we play at
home or on the the road or play against anybody. Let's get this
over with.''

will televise Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   _ Probable starting pitchers: Tonight, LHP Tom Glavine (18-6,
2.62; 16-6, 3.42 lifetime vs. Phillies) vs. RHP Curt Schilling
(14-13, 3.25; 5-7, 4.08 lifetime vs. Braves). Tuesday, RHP Kevin
Millwood (15-8, 4.34; 3-0, 2.06 lifetime vs. Phillies) vs. RHP

</P>
<P>
   _ Series history: Atlanta leads the all-time series 224-183 and
is 25-8 against the Phillies the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   _ Past meetings: The Braves are 6-3 with Philadelphia this
season, last seeing the Phillies July 22-23 and sweeping a two-game
series at Veterans Stadium. Andres Galarraga had a two-homer game
July 22 and Kevin Millwood held the Phils to two runs over seven
innings to win the second game 3-2. Atlanta hasn't lost a season
series to the Phils since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   _ Phillies leaders: Avg. _ Kevin Sefcik (.319); HR _ Scott Rolen
(28); RBI _ Rolen (104); SB _ Doug Glaville (23). W _ Curt
Schilling (14); ERA _ Paul Byrd (2.84). Saves _ Mark Leiter (23).

taken a series against a winning team since taking three of four
from Boston June 22-25. . . . The Phillies are 4-6 this month and
27-37 in the second half. . . . No team has given up more homers
than the Phillies' 179, 62 more than the Braves staff. Philadelphia
also lead the NL in wild pitches (57) and rank in the bottom three
in four other pitching catagories. . . . The team would be nowhere
without 3B Scott Rolen and CF Doug Glanville. Rolen has scored 106
runs while driving in 104 while Glanville ranks in the league's top
10 in hits and multi-hit games. With both over the 100-run mark,
the Phillies have two right-handed hitters reaching the century
mark for the first time since 1932 (Dick Bartell and George Davis).
. . . Bobby Abreu is hitting .444 with runners in scoring position,
best in the NL with at least 80 at-bats. . . . The Braves saw
enough of Schilling in the first two weeks to last a season. In
back-to-back starts April 5 and 10, Schilling beat the Braves
twice, allowing seven hits and one earned run while striking out 25
in 18 innings. . . . On the DL: RHP Matt Beech (sprained right
elbow ligament), RHP Billy Brewer (right elbow surgery), and RHP
Ron Blazier (elbow surgery).
</P>
<P>
   _ Who's hot: Scott Rolen has 21 RBI in his last 21 games.
Wendell McGee, called up from Class AAA Scranton/Wilkes-Barre on
Aug. 29, has hit .375 since then.
</P>
<P>
   _ Who's not: Through July 10, Desi Relaford was batting .305.
Since then, he is 30-for-194 (.155). Bobby Estalella is batting
.135 with runners in scoring position.

 &HT;    Maddux's injury first felt last week
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Greg Maddux first felt something in his last start
Tuesday in Montreal, discomfort under his right armpit. Trainers
treated him for a couple days and he thought little more of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of hard to get something treated that doesn't
hurt,'' Maddux said. ``I got treatment the first day or so and I
figured maybe it was just sore. Who knows why? Maybe it's the
innings or just getting older.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the best, if only, explanation for the muscle strain
under the right arm that sidelined Maddux Sunday, when the same
pain returned. Though Maddux doubted it would cause him to miss any
time, the news was hardly encouraging to the Braves after a 6-5
loss to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to be fine,'' said manager Bobby Cox.
``That's a very unusual place. His elbow is fine. Everything else
is fine. He just came up (after the sixth) and said this was really
tight and it wouldn't loosen up. So I'm absolutely not taking any
chances.''
</P>
<P>
   Maddux will start a sequence of ultra-sound and
eletro-stimulation treatments but did not know when he might try to
throw again. The injury came just as he appeared to regain form,
following two straight losses. Before coming out with a 1-0 lead
Sunday, Maddux had thrown 10 scoreless innings and allowed two hits
with 10 strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time is probably better (treatment) than anything,'' he said.
``Just a couple days.''

 &HT;    Inside college football: Dreams turn into nightmares for FSU,
Michigan, Irish
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   So where do we go from here?
</P>
<P>
   That's the question a number of football teams are asking
themselves this morning as they try to pick up the pieces of a
shattered weekend. These are just a few of the top programs that
may have seen national championship hopes end on the second
Saturday in September:
</P>
<P>
   _ Florida State: The Seminoles had the team and the schedule to
go undefeated but inexplicably Chris Weinke threw six interceptions
on Saturday and FSU lost to N.C. State for only its second ACC loss
ever. Suddenly, the Seminoles look human with teams like Southern
California, Virginia, Miami and Florida still on the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   _ Arizona State: The Sun Devils were a darkhorse national
championship contender because they didn't have to play UCLA in the
Pac-10. After losing in the final seconds to Washington two weeks
ago, Arizona State is now 0-2 after losing to BYU 26-6 late
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   _ Michigan: With nine starters returning from the nation's No. 1
defense, the defending AP national champions were primed to make
another run. But the Wolverines looked uninspired and poorly
coached in a 38-28 loss to Syracuse. Now they are 0-2 and the Big
Ten schedule has yet to begin.
</P>
<P>
   _ Notre Dame: The Irish thought they had turned the corner back
to greatness after beating Michigan in the opener. Old coach Lou
Holtz starts talking Fiesta Bowl for the Irish.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong.
</P>
<P>
   All of those warm and fuzzy feeling were undone late Saturday
night as Notre Dame was embarrassed at Michigan State 45-23.
</P>
<P>
   One unhappy coach
</P>
<P>
   Under Steve Spurrier, Florida has usually made its best
improvement each season from its first game to its second. Spurrier
was less than happy after Saturday night's 42-10 win over Northeast
Louisiana which included five Gator turnovers -- two interceptions,
three fumbles -- all in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Spurrier knows that turnovers have been the difference in the
last five wins over Tennessee, which the Gators play Saturday night
Knoxville (8 p.m., CBS).
</P>
<P>
   ``We just don't seem to be very smart right now,'' said
Spurrier. ``What is scary is the teams we are going to start
playing now, we are not all that much better talent-wise. If we
don't get a lot smarter and play within the rules and play like we
know what is going on out there, we could be in dire straits.''
</P>
<P>
   Heisman update
</P>
<P>
   _ Tim Couch, Kentucky: 32 of 41, 372 yards, 5 TDs against
Eastern Kentucky. Through two games, Couch has 870 yards and 12
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   _ Shaun Alexander, Alabama: 206 yards and three touchdowns
against Vanderbilt. In two games, Alexander has 321 yards and eight
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cade McNown, UCLA: 20 of 30 passes for 339 yards and three
touchdowns against Texas. He has passed for more than 200 yards in
16 straight games.
</P>
<P>
   _ Daunte Culpepper, Central Florida: Threw for 406 yards and
four touchdowns in a rout of Eastern Illinois. He also ran for
three touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ricky Williams, Texas: 29 carries for 160 yards in the loss to
UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   _ Donovan McNabb, Syracuse: Completed 21 of 27 passes for 233
yards as the Orangemen stunned Michigan. McNabb has completed 43 of
55 passes (78.2 percent) in his first two games.
</P>
<P>
   Widenhofer at TD Club
</P>
<P>
   Vanderbilt coach Woody Widenhofer will be the featured speaker
at today's first meeting of the Atlanta Touchdown Club at the Cobb
Galleria Centre. Lunch will begin at noon. Tickets for the event
may be purchased at the door. For more information, call (770)
953-3200.
</P>
<P>
   SEC climbing polls
</P>
<P>
   Six SEC teams are ranked in the new Associated Press Top 25.
Four (Florida, Tennessee, LSU, Georgia) in the Top 12. Alabama and

 &HT;    Falcons come from behind to defeat Eagles 17-12
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There might be a temptation to refer to the Atlanta
Falcons' 17-12 victory against Philadelphia as a wakeup call, a
reminder that this team is not ready to hit the cruise-control
button.
</P>
<P>
   There is no cruise control.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons were pushed all over the field for two quarters on
Sunday at the Georgia Dome by a team that lost 38-0 at home last
week to Seattle. Atlanta trailed 9-0 at halftime, and it could have
been worse. Philadelphia missed a 45-yard field goal attempt and
had a touchdown negated by penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing was working early for Atlanta. The Eagles outgained the
Falcons 208-63 in the first half, prompting Atlanta coach Dan
Reeves to play shrink in the locker room. That's a nice way of
describing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach chewed us out pretty good,'' defensive end Lester
Archambeau said. ``He said they got on us and were kicking out
butt.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no mistake in the analysis, just shock.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons were varied, ranging from a lack of emotion and
energy on the Falcons' side to perhaps a stale gameplan. Both
fueled the Eagles' fire.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the Falcons record improved to 2-0 for the first
time since 1986 because they scored touchdowns on their first two
drives of the second half. The first score came on a 19-yard pass
pass from Chris Chandler to Brian Kozlowski, marking the 14th
straight game in which Chandler passed for a touchdown and tying
the franchise record with Steve Bartkowski and Chris Miller.
</P>
<P>
   It also helped ease the memory of Chandler's uneven first half,
in which he completed 6-of-15 passes, and threw several errant
passes.
</P>
<P>
   The second touchdown came on a 1-yard run by Jamal Anderson. The
key play in the seven-play, 46-yard drive was a roughing the passer
penalty against Philadelphia's Matt Stevens, who apparently went
for Chandler's head during the sack attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta was not in the mood to turn down gifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came out in the first half, and they totally dominated the
football game and the tempo,'' Falcons coach Dan Reeves said. ``You
really worry about (players taking the Eagles too lightly). We
talked about it in every single meeting we had. It's just hard for
them to get the message.''
</P>
<P>
   They got it in time, though, and Reeves wasn't the only one
delivering it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just looked each other in the eye, and we knew we were
giving them too much,'' Atlanta cornerback Ray Buchanan said. ``Me,
(defensive end) Chuck Smith, we were getting on ourselves, each
other. We were saying . . . let's play like we should. We had so
many missed tackles.''
</P>
<P>
   Missed tackles were tangible evidence. But there also was the
mystery of why Atlanta wasn't challenging rookie Eagles cornerbacks
Allen Rossum and Al Harris. Atlanta wide receivers caught just two
passes in the first half for 22 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were expecting two-deep coverage (zone) in the first half
(to protect the rookie corners), and they didn't (do it),'' said
wide receiver Terance Mathis, who finished with three catches for
24 yards. ``So we made the adjustment at halftime and started
throwing the ball downfield.''
</P>
<P>
   As was the case at Carolina last week, the Falcons put this one
away in the second half by cranking up a running game that was
nearly dormant in the first half. Rookie cornerback Elijah
Williams' last-minute conversion to running back didn't help. He
had two carries for minus-two yards. ``The defensive speed is a lot
faster in the NFL, than I remember in college,'' said Williams, who
last played running back at Florida in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But Anderson managed 58 of his 74 yards in the second half, and
Atlanta had a huge time-of-possession edge, 19:03-10:57.
</P>
<P>
   As the Falcons enter their bye week before a Sept. 27 game at
San Francisco, there are concerns. Chandler was sacked three more
times by a team that had none last week. Meanwhile, the Falcons had
two sacks in the second half, but the starting defensive line has
one in two games.
</P>
<P>
   Strongside linebacker Henri Crockett dislocated his left wrist
on the second play, and will be out six to eight weeks.
</P>
<P>
   After the way this one started, though, when the Eagles took the
opening possession 79 yards on 13 plays in 7:14 and after Atlanta
managed just 16 yards in the first quarter, things could have been
worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't played nearly as well as we're capable,'' said
Reevens, whose team has won eight of 10.
</P>
<P>
   But all is not lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The comeback) shows me so much character,'' said Buchanan.
``We didn't play the way we were supposed to, but we ended up
winning. That's what matters. Find a way.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ She was presented to the world by President Clinton
as the family ``role model'' of the White House, the upright,
churchgoing presidential secretary whose fear-stricken appearance
before a grand jury in January generated several days of needed
sympathy for an administration under siege.
</P>
<P>
   But Betty Currie, who has presided at the gate of the Oval
Office for the last five years, played a far less savory role for
the president beginning in 1995, according to the report released
on Friday by Whitewater independent counsel Kenneth Starr. After
Clinton and Monica Lewinsky began their affair, Mrs. Currie
facilitated their clandestine meetings and often helped Ms.
Lewinsky bypass the system designed to note all presidential
visitors, the report says.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Currie even came into the White House on her days off for
the sole purpose of admitting Ms. Lewinsky to Oval Office meetings
alone with the president, according to sworn testimony from both
Mrs. Currie and Ms. Lewinsky. She allowed herself to be used as the
cover story for visits by Ms. Lewinsky, who would falsely tell
security guards that she was at the White House to see the
president's private secretary.
</P>
<P>
   She even had a code name, Kay, that she would use when sending
messages to and from Ms. Lewinsky, including several occasions when
she frantically paged Ms. Lewinsky to discuss Starr's
investigation, apparently at the president's request.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Currie told the grand jury that she suspected something
improper was occurring between the president and the former intern.
But the portrait that emerges from Starr's report, based on several
days of testimony from Mrs. Currie and Ms. Lewinsky, is one of a
close aide who almost certainly knew what was happening behind the
slightly open door of the president's private study. She testified
that she knew most of the meetings between the two were personal
rather than business-related, and at one point told Ms. Lewinsky
not to tell her any further details.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't want to hear it,'' she said, after Ms. Lewinsky tried to
persuade her that nothing really happened if no one saw the
encounters. ``Don't say any more. I don't want to hear any more.''
</P>
<P>
   Her thoughts about the relationship, as told to the grand jury,
were a curious mixture of elaborate justification and fear of the
worst.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was spending a lot of time with a 24-year-old young lady,''
she said. ``I know he has said that young people keep him involved
in what's happening in the world, so I knew that was one reason,
but there was a concern of mine that she was spending more time
than most.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Currie's attorney, Lawrence Wechsler, could not be reached
for comment over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   It had already been known that Mrs. Currie played an important
role in the drama by retrieving several gifts that Clinton had
given Ms. Lewinsky, an action that prosecutors charge was performed
at the president's behest and constituted obstruction of justice.
(Mrs. Currie testified that it might have been Ms. Lewinsky who
asked her to pick up the gifts, which she hid under her bed until
prosecutors demanded them.) But the degree to which she made the
liaisons possible was one of the most surprising revelations in the
Starr report, shedding a remarkable light on the nature of human
traffic in the West Wing.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Currie's stature at the White House was such that with her
permission, Ms. Lewinsky could come and go freely into the Oval
Office, even though Ms. Lewinsky's position would not normally
allow her any access to the famous seat of power that has become an
international symbol of presidential authority. Secret Service
agents noted Ms. Lewinsky's regular presence with annoyance, but
told the grand jury that they were obliged to admit her at Mrs.
Currie's instruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know who it is,'' Mrs. Currie would tell the officer in
the West Wing lobby when Ms. Lewinsky was on her way over. Several
agents also said Mrs. Currie tried to persuade them to admit Ms.
Lewinsky without making a log entry of her visit.
</P>
<P>
   After higher-ranking administration employees grew suspicious of
Ms. Lewinsky's frequent visits, Mrs. Currie testified, she would
often lead Ms. Lewinsky to the Oval Office by a back route. On
weekends and at night, when other employees were not present,
``there would be no need to sneak,'' Mrs. Currie said, and so she
allowed Ms. Lewinsky to wait for the president in her own outer
office.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Ms. Lewinsky said, she asked the president why he
didn't clear her into the White House himself instead of using Mrs.
Currie.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said because if someone comes to see him, there's a list
circulated among the staff members and then everyone would be
questioning why I was there to see him,'' she testified.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Starr report says that Mrs. Currie deliberately avoided
writing down or retaining most of the messages that Ms. Lewinsky
left for the president _ a violation of standard procedure at the
White House _ and that she would often place the president's calls
to Ms. Lewinsky directly rather than go through the White House
operators, who keep records of outgoing calls.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Currie's opinion of Ms. Lewinsky seemed to shift along with
the president's affair. By 1997, after Clinton had ended the
relationship and Ms. Lewinsky was growing increasingly despondent
and desperate to return to a job in the White House, Mrs. Currie
said she began to consider Ms. Lewinsky and her frequent tearful
phone calls ``a pain in the neck, more or less.'' She found Ms.
Lewinsky ``a little bit pushy,'' and resisted the president's
request that she find her a White House job.
</P>
<P>
   But she agreed to ask John Podesta, the deputy White House chief
of staff, to find a job for Ms. Lewinsky in New York, and faxed Ms.
Lewinsky's resume to the United Nations. She also contacted Vernon
Jordan, the president's close friend, to seek his help in finding a
New York job for Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Her testimony on this and other points was far more vague and
thus helpful to the president than prosecutors had hoped. Both
Jordan and Ms. Lewinsky testified that they had reason to believe
the president was behind Mrs. Currie's overture to Jordan, but Ms.
Currie said that she contacted Jordan on her own initiative. She
later testified that while the president probably talked with her
about Ms. Lewinsky's job hunt, she could not recall whether he was
directly involved.
</P>
<P>
   But many of her other, more direct statements provided the
grounds for Starr to accuse the president of impeachable offenses.
The honesty of those statements clashed diametrically with her
earlier intentions to protect her boss.
</P>
<P>
   Under oath, she provided some testimony showing that Clinton was
alone with Ms. Lewinsky, contradicting his statements that he had
not been. (Asked explicitly whether they had been alone, she echoed
the president's statement that he was never truly alone because
other people were in the general area.) A year before she
testified, however, she had waited for 15 or 20 minutes while the
two had a sexual encounter in his study, and then accompanied both
of them out of the Oval Office. Her explanation: ``I didn't want
any perceptions, him being alone with someone.''

COMMENTARY: STARR'S UNFINISHED BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The scope of the independent counsel's initial
referral is too narrow: Ken Starr was hired to look into worse
abuses than the cover-up of a sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's defense, however, is disappointingly weak:
admit sin but deny crime, and beg forgiveness for lying while
continuing to lie.
</P>
<P>
   The central fact making a mockery of his misty-eyed
``repentance'' is this: He refuses to admit, even now, that he and
Monica Lewinsky had a sexual relationship.
</P>
<P>
   That phrase was precisely defined by a federal judge to include
oral sex and intimate touching. He denied it falsely in his Paula
Jones deposition; he repeated the false denial before a federal
grand jury; and even today he would have the nation believe that he
never once touched Ms. Lewinsky's proffered bosom during their 10
Oval Office assignations.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody believes him because his look-ma-no-hands assertion so
patently defies common sense. Why does he persist in the lie? Two
reasons:
</P>
<P>
   1. If he admits lying in his January Jones deposition, the 8th
Circuit Court of Appeals would likely reinstate Ms. Jones' case. A
jury would surely believe her now, which would cost Clinton a
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
   2. If he admits having repeated to the grand jury in August his
false and misleading testimony, the president would be confessing
to perjury. That would be an undisputed count in an impeachment,
and whenever he left office might result in his arrest and
conviction _ the dread ``Jail to the Chief.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, his continued lying is not irrational. He runs great
financial and legal risks in telling the whole truth. That's why we
see his legalistic contortions and semantic evasions that turn
truth on its head. Clinton's tactic is to limit potential loss. But
this continued lying will expose his false contrition, erode
popular support and hasten his political demise.
</P>
<P>
   His defense strategy is overly cautious. He should realistically
face up to the likelihood of House impeachment, and if he is to win
Senate acquittal, he must risk all. That means telling the whole
truth now and gutsily facing the consequences later, which would
give credence to his argument that the concealment of adultery is
not the ``high'' crime that justifies removal.
</P>
<P>
   He would win back considerable respect by pledging to reject any
pardon and daring the independent counsel to bring him to trial for
perjury on Jan. 21, 2001. (Not much of a gamble; no D.C. jury would
convict him.) And while he's at it, apologize to Paula and settle
her case.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton does not have it in his character to cut out the present
artful dodging and do this, of course; it would be the political
equivalent of all-out, clothes-off intercourse. Someday he may look
back and say, ``If I had only dared . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Now to Starr's unfinished business. His referral completes less
than one-fourth of his assignments.
</P>
<P>
   Starr is duty-bound, after these four years, to come up with
indictments or criminal informations on the Whitewater obstruction,
the Clintons' abuse of Justice Department prosecution to make
places for travel office patronage, and the invasion of 900 FBI
files by White House snoops. Or to report on those investigations
if they exonerate Hillary, Bruce Lindsey, Craig Livingstone et al,
which would force calumniators like me to eat crow and thereby
lessen impeachment heat.
</P>
<P>
   In the sex cover-up, we see direct conflicts of grand jury
testimony. Monica swears that Vernon Jordan told her at a breakfast
to destroy evidence, but the president's friend insists the
breakfast never happened; on another front, Jordan's testimony
conflicts with Clinton's. Is the prosecutor fearful of being
trounced in jury trials, where rules of evidence and presumption of
innocence apply _ as they do not in his House referral?
</P>
<P>
   Surprises may be in store. ``All phases of the investigation are
now nearing completion,'' Starr promises in his report. Do they
show a pattern of deceit and delay, of stonewalling and spinning,
of perjury and abuse of power on heavy political matters _ Clinton
habits so dramatically demonstrated in the cover-up of a sex
scandal?
</P>
<P>
   Many will find poetic justice in Clinton's escaping discovery of
high crimes and being brought down by lower crimes. But poetic
justice, or rough justice, is not real justice. If forthrightly
confessed, perjury about workplace dalliance should not be enough
to force out a president.

 &HT;    Rafter repeats as U.S. Open champ
 &HT;    By Todd Holcomb
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK - History says the winner of consecutive U.S. Open
singles championships is an heir to the No. 1 ranking. Patrick
Rafter looked worthy of that title Sunday in a 6-3, 3-6, 6-2, 6-0
victory over Australian countryman Mark Philippoussis in the men's
final.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year I was jumpy and nervous and all over the place,''
said Rafter, the sixth back-to-back U.S. Open champion in the open
era, ``but this year I felt I belonged there. I feel last year
wasn't a fluke then. I've consolidated it. I've done it again.''
</P>
<P>
   The official scorer was generous in the definition, but Rafter
was called for only five unforced errors, none in the third set,
and 24 fewer than Philippoussis for the match. Rafter also allowed
Philippoussis just three break-point chances while earning 20 of
his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five errors for the whole match, that's impressive,''
Philippoussis said. ``At the moment, he's playing like the best
player in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Rafter moved past Marcelo Rios to No. 2 in the rankings behind
Pete Sampras, but for the past three months, Rafter has clearly
been the best. He's won 23 of his last 24 matches, beating seven
top-10 players and winning four titles. Consider that Sampras has
beaten only one top-10 player, Karol Kucera, all year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the summer, I've probably had the best results out of
everyone,'' Rafter said. ``I wish the next few tournaments were on
this sort of (hardcourt) surface. You can't be on this surface all
the time and be a No. 1 player in the world. I've got to prove
myself again in the indoor season to rival Pete at the top.''
</P>
<P>
   The other players who have won consecutive U.S. Opens in the
open era are arguably the five premier players of the post-Bjorn
Borg era -- Pete Sampras (1995-96), Stefan Edberg (1991-92), Ivan
Lendl (1985-87), Jimmy Connors (1982-83) and John McEnroe
(1979-81). All have been No. 1 in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Philippousis' end came in the third set, serving at 2-3. He
saved three break points and was at deuce when Rafter pushed back
and overhead that Philippoussis smashed at him in the corner rather
than into the open court. Rafter won it on when Philippoussis
netted a volley. Rafter then broke serve and won the final 10 games
of the match.
</P>
<P>
   The Rafter-Philippoussis matchup was the first all-Australian
final since 1970, when Ken Rosewall beat Tony Roche. That was also
the last time Australians had won in consecutive years as Rod Laver
won in 1969 to complete the final Grand Slam in men's tennis.
</P>
<P>
   Rafter is the first Australian to win back-to-back U.S. titles
since Neale Fraser in 1959-60.

 &HT;    Planetary rotation confounds clocks
 &HT;    By Dick Stanley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ University of Texas astronomers want you to know
exactly why time will linger for a second _ but only for a second _
on the last second of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   It galls these scientists whenever they hear or read that the
standstill is necessary to compensate for tidal forces that are
slowing down the Earth's rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ninety-nine articles out of 100 will say that, and it's wrong,
wrong, wrong, wrong,'' said Peter Shelus, a research astronomer at
UT's McDonald Observatory in West Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Shelus particularly worries about this because he specializes in
time. He manages the observatory's Laser Ranging Operations, and he
will be attentive on the last second of Dec. 31 when time stands
still long enough for the world's official timekeepers to insert an
extra second into the year. They'll do it to get their precise
atomic clocks into sync with the planet's somewhat unreliable
rotation.
</P>
<P>
   One extra second is all that the ominous-sounding Directorate of
Time _ actually a division of the U.S. Naval Observatory in
Washington _ needs to get the Coordinated Universal Time clocks up
to snuff.
</P>
<P>
   This leap second, as it is called, is similar to the day added
during leap years to get the calendar in line with the planet's
journey around the sun. This year's leap second will be the 22nd
extra-second adjustment decreed by the International Bureau of
Weights and Measures in Paris, France, under international
agreements.
</P>
<P>
   The last leap second was added on June 30, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Leap seconds are necessary because the atomic timepieces are far
more precise than the roughly 24-hour day dictated by the planet's
rotation. Traditionally, time was set by the rotation of the planet
because people became accustomed to the passage of the sun across
the sky. Early clock makers used pendulums to set time's rate, but
they are affected by humidity and faulty mechanisms. But the
planet's rotation, which is affected by the tides and such things
as the globe's friction with its atmosphere and the sloshing of the
liquid metal at its core, is consistent to only a mere few
thousandths of a second per day.
</P>
<P>
   To be more precise, scientists arbitrarily chose to mark time by
the reliable vibrations of cesium atoms. They defined the solar
second as 9.162770 billion atomic vibrations. Atomic clocks
calculate the passage of time by measuring the vibration of cesium
atoms, which are accurate to within a few billionths of a second
per day.
</P>
<P>
   Most people wouldn't miss a second, or even two, but Shelus said
the world's space agencies, for example, would quickly notice the
loss. When a satellite is moving through its orbit at several miles
a second, a second can go a long way. Complicating things is the
Earth's movement around the sun at 14 miles a second.
</P>
<P>
   But the leap second is something of a dinosaur and may
eventually be discarded. Increasingly, jetliners, ships and even
sport fishermen navigate the planet with electronic instruments
taking signals from a constellation of satellites called the Global
Positioning System. Each satellite carries its own cesium atomic
clock.
</P>
<P>
   So enjoy this year's extra second. There may not be a second
chance.

CLINTON-MASSACHUSSETTS, 9-13 -- Rep. Jim McGovern, Democrat of
Massachussetts, talking with Judy Ellis at the Wrentham Town Common
on Saturday. Most Democratic candidates can't do enough to distance
themselves from President Clinton. But not Jim McGovern.
``Notwithstanding the fact that you can't pick up a newspaper and
not read about scandals, there's a lot more to the government than
scandal,'' says McGovern. (Rick Friedman/New York Times Photo)

a Cub Scout leader and a Democrat who voted for Clinton, at the
annual Poolesville street fair. Cooper opposes impeachment
proceedings. ``It's true that the country has been terribly hurt by
all this,'' says Cooper. ``What he's done is inexcusable, but it

that it's all been aired, let's push on.'' (Justin Lane/New York

expectations are a staple these days at Frontier Corp., as the
company tries to evolve beyond its roots as a local phone monopoly.
In many ways, Frontier's evolution from clumsy striver to

 UNDATED: many tasks.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky's very description of that encounter summons images
of Clinton's capacity for playing hearts, watching television,
talking on the telephone and reading a document simultaneously, _
although according to her account, he was eating pizza, receiving
oral sex and talking on the telephone with a congressman.
</P>
<P>
   To veteran Clinton-watchers, the report's accumulated detail
rings true in other trivial but telling ways, from the president's
careful assertion _ seconded by Ms. Lewinsky _ that he always left
the door ajar during his illicit encounters with Ms. Lewinsky in a
hallway off the Oval Office, (presumably so he could argue they
were never alone behind closed doors) to Ms. Lewinsky's assertion
that Clinton told her that accusations that he harassed Kathleen
Willey, a former White House volunteer, were ``ludicrous because he
would never approach a small-breasted woman'' (even in front of
reporters, the president has freely let his eyes fall to a woman's
ample decolletage).
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has long been known for his late-night telephone calls
to aides and friends, and for his capacity to talk a blue streak.
Ms. Lewinsky testified that he frequently called her after
midnight, several times for phone sex, and that after one such
exchange, he fell asleep in midconversation.
</P>
<P>
   In other ways, too, the report tells a familiar tale.
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. Lewinsky lingered in the Oval Office on Feb. 28, 1997,
the fateful day when she says she and the president resumed their
sexual encounters after 11 months, and when he stained her dress
with his semen, the president's personal aide, Goodin, tried to
shoo Ms. Lewinsky away. Goodin testified that ``I did not know if
that was a good use of his time,'' but the president replied,
``She's a friend of a political supporter.'' Like so many of
Clinton's comments in this case and others, that was literally
true, because Ms. Lewinsky had obtained her internship in the first
place through the efforts of a wealthy Democratic contributor,
Walter Kaye. But it was also, typically, incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   Former aides, from Dick Morris to George Stephanopoulos, have
long noted that Clinton never works harder to win someone over than
when he fears he may be in danger of losing their support, while he
saves his harshest treatment for the aides whose loyalty he knows
is unquestioned. In this regard, it is perhaps significant that Ms.
Lewinsky told the grand jury that Clinton was ``the most
affectionate with me he'd ever been'' on July 4, 1997, at a time
when she had implicitly threatened to reveal their relationship and
just moments after Clinton had coldly warned her: ``It's illegal to
threaten the president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides also agree that no topic has consumed Clinton more than
his own eventual legacy in office, and he has studied biographies
of his predecessors with care. So it was perhaps no coincidence
that, Ms. Lewinsky said, Clinton first sought to break off their
relationship on the one day reserved by the federal government to
honor great presidents: President's Day, Feb. 19, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, few words in the report are more damning than
Clinton's own in his grand jury testimony. They are full of the
half-confessions and semi-evasions that have marked his handling of
policy questions, from taxes to use of U.S. troops in Bosnia, and
that have suffused his approach to the Lewinsky matter from the
beginning.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Clinton testified that he and Ms. Lewinsky ``might
have talked about what to do in a nonlegal context'' to hide their
relationship, even as he rejected any suggestion that he sought to
influence her testimony in the Jones sexual misconduct suit.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, Clinton's words seem simply comic. Asked in his
deposition in the Jones case if he had ever given Ms. Lewinsky any
gifts, the president replied: ``I don't recall. Do you know what
they were?'' In his grand jury testimony, he acknowledged
reciprocating gifts from Ms. Lewinsky on the grounds of etiquette,
saying, ``It was a right thing to do to give her gifts back.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his presidency, Clinton has repeatedly been forced to
apologize for mistakes that even many of his closest allies thought
he could have avoided in the first place, and his vision has
generally been clearest in hindsight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sick after it was over,'' Clinton testified of the
resumption of his sexual encounters with Ms. Lewinsky on Feb. 28,
1997. ``And I, I was pleased at that time that it had been nearly a
year since any inappropriate contact had occurred with Ms.
Lewinsky. I promised myself it wasn't going to happen again. The
facts are complicated about what did happen and how it happened.
But, nonetheless, I'm responsible for it.''

<P>
   In historic Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem Sunday, Rev.
Calvin Butts III drew embarrassed titters from his congregation as
he urged the men and women in the pews who may be having
extramarital affairs to sidle up to their paramours on the sidewalk
after services, end the relationship and ask for forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we watch the president, we see each other, we see
ourselves,'' Butts told his congregation, to growing applause.
``Each one of us suffers from our own blemishes, our own envy, our
own backbiting, our own meanspiritedness. Have mercy, oh God.''
</P>
<P>
   In sermons explicit or indirect, in tones both angry and
mournful, members of the clergy across the country this weekend
struggled to offer their congregations some guideposts to make
sense of the presidential morality tale unfolding in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In a broad diversity of churches of many denominations,
conservative and liberal, large and small, ministers emphasized the
theme of forgiveness, saying no one is free of sin, and that only
God has the power to judge, to forgive and to redeem.
</P>
<P>
   ``God loves Bill Clinton,'' said Rev. Darrell Mount, pastor at
Trinity United Methodist Church in downtown Denver. ``And Hillary.
And Monica. And Chelsea. God loves each one of those persons caught
in this lost situation.''
</P>
<P>
   With a few exceptions, clergy members refrained from calling for
the impeachment or the resignation of President Clinton. Most
denounced the president for his adultery and for demeaning his
family, his office and the nation. But some ministers also
chastised the independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, for issuing a
sexually salacious report, the public for devouring it, news
organizations for circulating it and politicians who appear to be
rushing to judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pray for the moral discernment of the media that knows
sexual details can increase ratings,'' preached the Rev. Brenda
Stiers, executive minister of the Riverside Church in New York.
``We ask you to restrain us from having an immediate political
reaction and instead take us to the deep recesses of our hearts
where moral decisions are made.''
</P>
<P>
   This past weekend happened to fall at a time when both the
Christian and Jewish liturgies are focused on themes of repentance
and forgiveness. The Roman Catholic lectionary for Sunday took up
the story of the wayward Prodigal Son who spends his inheritance on
prostitutes, and yet is forgiven. Jews on Saturday night celebrated
the Selichot service, a midnight ceremony marking the beginning of
the High Holiday season of introspection, self-examination and
repentance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all familiar with the adage `the leopard can't change
his spots,''' said Rabbi Marc Schneier, president of the New York
Board of Rabbis, and rabbi at The Hampton Synagogue in Westhampton
Beach. ``Selichot brings the reassuring message that we can change.
We are not eternally guilty by past misconduct.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, a significant number of clergy members in many cities
said they had chosen to avoid the Clinton affair entirely in their
sermons. Even the pastors of some of the nation's largest
evangelical ``megachurches'' _ some known as centers of moral and
theological conservatism _ said they were intentionally steering
clear of the topic.
</P>
<P>
   At First African Methodist Episcopal Church in South Central Los
Angeles, the oldest black church in Los Angeles with 16,000
members, the leadership of the church met about a week ago and
decided no longer to talk about the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal from
the pulpit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just felt like it had been addressed enough,'' said the
Rev. Jeanne Beharry. ``It's been discussed and overly discussed in
the newspaper, on television, every Bible study group. There has to
be a point where you say, `How much discussion is necessary?' and
if I had my druthers, I'd druther not discuss it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Gregory Boyle, a Jesuit priest with the Dolores Mission
Church in the Boyle Heights section of East Los Angeles, said,
``There are just too many life and death issues about which we must
preach, and so to preach about Bill Clinton and his situation is
not really relevant to the real issues of folks in a community like
this.'' To do so, Boyle said, would be to risk being labeled
irrelevant by the congregation.
</P>
<P>
   Even Cardinal John O'Connor, the Roman Catholic archbishop of
New York, said at St. Patrick's Cathedral Sunday that his silence
on the Clinton matter has caused ``perplexity and has provoked
others to question my courage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this to be the church's new approach?'' O'Connor said.
``That I point to people in the congregation and say, `I know your
sins, you shouldn't be here. Stand up.'''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor said, ``I have no intention of starting such
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did not appear for services at Foundry United Methodist
Church, which he usually attends while in Washington, avoiding both
the media camped on the church's steps and the pastor's sermon
about forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Forgiveness was not the chorus in every house of worship,
however. At the Presbyterian Church of Western Springs, Ill., a
bedroom community of Chicago, the Rev. David Bebb Jones, a
self-described political liberal and moral conservative, preached:
``The president ought to resign immediately. He has violated a
sacred trust, probably a constitutional trust, and surely the
people's trust. I can think of no other position in the country
where such behavior would not result in immediate dismissal,
including the ministry.''
</P>
<P>
   At Trinity Church in downtown Boston, about 150 members of the
Episcopal congregation turned out for an afternoon forum titled
``Immorality in High Places.''
</P>
<P>
   William Barnwell, an associate rector at Trinity, said of
Clinton, ``Even now he will be forgiven by God. Nevertheless,
grievous sin does have grievous consequences. President Clinton has
scarred the institution of the presidency, the Democratic party, of
which I am a proud member, and collective body of the American
people as well of course his own family and Monica Lewinsky. And
those scars will not go away whether he is impeached or not,
whether he resigns or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Intertwined with such chords of despair, some religious leaders
and their congregants said they sensed that Clinton's public
humiliation and confession could be the beginning of ``healing''
for himself, his family and other people wrestling with sin.
</P>
<P>
   As he left a forum on Clinton's transgressions Saturday night at
Wilshire Boulevard Temple in Los Angeles, Bill Steinberg, a temple
member, said, ``I think people are going to synagogues and churches
looking for something different than what they're getting from the
media, looking for forgiveness and looking for healing. I think
that's why people are here tonight. We dont want our nation torn
apart.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The name falls from their lips with
uncharacteristic reverence, like ballplayers conjuring up Joe
DiMaggio in Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rodino _ he did an extraordinary job,'' said Sheila
Jackson-Lee, a Texas Democrat on the Judiciary Committee,
mentioning the subdued, even-handed chairman of the committee
during Watergate. ``He will be my role model.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Ms. Jackson-Lee, who is known for lengthy attacks on
Republicans and their policies, added, ``I will not venture into
the muddy waters of partisanship.''
</P>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom, and recent history, seem to indicate
otherwise. Of all the House committees, the Judiciary Committee is
known as the most polarized and ideologically split on Capitol
Hill. Peter W. Rodino Jr. may have had a core of 10 moderates to
depend on to steer his course, but the current chairman, Rep. Henry
Hyde of Illinois, can count his on one hand.
</P>
<P>
   The polarization is no coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   As Rep. Jerrold Nadler of New York, a New York liberal, said,
the committee's agenda attracts extremes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very bifurcated committee,'' Nadler said. ``You get
people who are interested in abortion and civil rights and due
process. They tend not to be the moderates.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee regularly grapples with an assortment of divisive
issues, including affirmative action, tort overhaul, crime,
terrorism and same-sex marriages. Though the debates are usually
civil, party-line votes are the norm among the 21 Republicans and
16 Democrats; bipartisanship is the exception. What's more, the
panel is stocked with both the president's harshest critics and his
most unswerving supporters.
</P>
<P>
   There is Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., who asserts that Clinton has so
debased the presidency that last year, even before Monica Lewinsky
became news, he filed a resolution to impeach him.
</P>
<P>
   Barr also introduced a bill to prohibit the federal government
from recognizing same-sex marriages. Barr, who has been divorced
twice, said at the time, ``The flames of hedonism, the flames of
narcissism, the flames of self-centered morality are licking at the
very foundation of our society: the family unit.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, the committee's senior
Democrat and its only Watergate veteran, has been almost as severe
a critic of Kenneth Starr as Barr is of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Barney Frank of Massachusetts, the second-ranking Democrat
on the committee, is a nimble debater who is quick with a quip and
prone to impatience for what he considers poor displays of
intellect. Frank, who is expected to play a forceful role in the
proceedings, is also the brother of Ann Lewis, the White House
communications director.
</P>
<P>
   Another much-talked-about figure on the committee is Rep. Howard
Berman, D-Calif., considered a formidable legal presence by his
peers on the committee. Reserved and politically astute, Berman has
forged a close relationship with Hyde, the committee chairman.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the aisle, two bookish Florida Republicans
loom as central players: Rep. Bill McCollum, who has said perjury
will constitute an impeachable offense, and Rep. Charles Canady, a
constitutional expert who heads the subcommittee that has proposed
more Constitutional amendments than anyone since James Madison.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, eager to quell criticism about the panel's
membership, recently appointed their first woman, Rep. Mary Bono of
California, who won the seat held by her late husband, Sonny. The
Republican wing also includes several former judges and federal
prosecutors, who are likely to step back into those roles in any
hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Asa Hutchinson, a Republican who expressed ``shock'' at the
Starr report but urged his colleagues to be cautious about not
prejudging the president, was once a U.S. attorney in Arkansas. And
Rep. Ed Bryant, another Republican, was U.S. attorney in Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the credentials on both sides _ only three members did
not go to law school _ there is little question that the Democrats
on the committee are considerably flashier and more experienced in
the political arena than their Republican counterparts. The
committee's Republicans, while no less zealous in their views, are
largely a little less quick on their feet, a little more lawyerly
in their demeanor.
</P>
<P>
   Having so many lawyers in one room is both fortunate and
unfortunate. ``Lawyers tend to be more contentious and
argumentative, and that can show up,'' said Canady. ``But our legal
background will be helpful in making a judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides have hired experienced chief counsels accustomed to
gritty battlegrounds of a separate sort. David Schippers, the
Republican counsel, is a lifelong Chicago Democrat who put the
mobster Sam Giancana in prison. On the Democratic side is Abbe
Lowell, a Washington insider who has defended a roster of
scandal-tainted clients, including former House Speaker Jim Wright.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their ideological gulf, committee members bristle at the
idea that they cannot set aside their differences and behave
judiciously and thoughtfully, just as the committee did during
Watergate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There aren't going to be any food fights,'' Frank said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the gravity of the situation appears to be sinking in.
</P>
<P>
   ``All members feel their constitutional obligation,'' said Hyde,
who is considered fair-minded and gentlemanly and who is expected
to set the tone of the proceedings along with Conyers, despite the
Democrat's antipathy for Starr.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a matter we will relish doing,'' Hyde added.

 WASHINGTON: Hyde added.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even such conservative firebrands as Rep. Lindsey Graham,
R-S.C., who last year helped lead an effort to oust Newt Gingrich
as speaker for not being conservative enough, are dutifully
composing themselves for the task.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to speak out against any Republican who turns this
into `Let me tell you why I don't like Bill Clinton,''' Graham
said. ``I do that every day. But I'm playing a role here that is
big-time serious. The worst thing that can happen is for an
election to be overturned without a heck of a good reason.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that most of the members on the panel are not facing
tough re-election battles this November should help keep those
partisan flare-ups in check.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people are watching us closely'' Canady said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, too, say they want bipartisanship to rule. But a few
have already complained of an inauspicious beginning. Some
Democrats brimmed with outrage when the House voted on Friday to
approve the public release of Starr's report without first giving
the president a chance to inspect it.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Melvin Watt, D-N.C., a member of the Judiciary Committee,
criticized the action as unfair and tinged with political motives.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one looks like it's going to get into a real war,'' Watt
said, referring to a possible impeachment inquiry.

INTERNATIONAL OFFICIALS SAY ELECTIONS IN BOSNIA WERE A SUCCESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th)

<P>
   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina _ Despite glitches that may leave
voters in doubt about the legitimacy of elections this weekend,
international officials in charge of the balloting deemed it a
success and a tribute to progress toward democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The chief international official, Carlos Westendorp, said he
thought that moderate leaders might do better than thought by
foreign diplomats worried that the extreme nationalists who led
this country into a 43-month war and won the elections in 1996
would again triumph.
</P>
<P>
   ``The voters may have some surprises for the politicians,''
Westendorp said.
</P>
<P>
   At stake were seats in the national legislature, parliaments in
the Serb and Muslim-Croat halves of Bosnia, the Bosnian Serb
presidency and leadership of the 10 Muslim-Croat cantons, as well
as the three seats on the joint presidency, Bosnia's chief
executive body.
</P>
<P>
   The election was crucial to Western hopes of replacing hard-line
nationalist politicians with moderate leaders. Preliminary results
are expected on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The voting was peaceful, in contrast to other elections since
the war ended in 1995, when there was considerable tension. NATO
troops were hardly visible. Voters, often dressed in their best
clothes, lined up calmly at more than 2,000 polling places, each
monitored by an international supervisor and the Bosnian police.
</P>
<P>
   International election officials played down problems that the
losers might use to challenge results.
</P>
<P>
   The pattern seen on visits to 23 polling stations included the
foreign supervisors' saying there were no problems, and the Bosnian
election officials' eagerly reporting difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   In every station an average of 3 percent of the voters were
reported missing from the lists, enough to convince suspicious
inhabitants of the Balkans that something nefarious was afoot.
</P>
<P>
   In the Serb village of Karanovac an observer from a Bosnian Serb
party, Radomir Serdar, said foreign intervention in elections was
accepted, if not liked. ``But when these foreigners give us voting
lists that somehow don't include a lot of voters we suspect they
are setting the groundwork for fraud,'' Serdar said.
</P>
<P>
   In Jajce, three of the 30 people who went to vote in the first
three hours on Saturday were on the list.
</P>
<P>
   In Vogosca one station opened hours late because ballots and
voting lists had not arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Azra Smaijlbegovic searched in vain for her name. ``This could
be nothing more than a mistake,'' Miss Smaijlbegovic said. ``But
you know this is the Balkans, and anything could be happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Voters not on the lists were allowed to cast ballots sealed with
their names and national identity numbers and sent to Sarajevo for
checking against a master list. If a name is on that list, the vote
will count, foreign election officials said. &QL;

<P>
   With a mixture of solemnity, worry and sometimes sheer glee at
the crisis facing President Clinton, newspapers around the world
continued to be dominated by news of how a report about allegations
of sex and lies has threatened to topple the most powerful man in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Several media outlets posted the entire document on their
websites and editorial writers from Munich to Hong Kong ruminated
about its impact on the global economy.
</P>
<P>
   The coverage worldwide revealed as much about each country's
relationship with the United States as it did about its own press
traditions and sexual mores.
</P>
<P>
   In China, where Clinton is popular with the government and the
people, the papers offered unadorned reportage, with none of the
lurid narratives or fist-pounding editorials to be found elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The Sunday edition of The People's Daily, principal Communist
Party newspaper, ran a short article on page two, with a headline
that read, ``U.S. Congress Publishes Starr's Report, White House
Legal Advisers Rebut on Just Grounds.''
</P>
<P>
   The article reported the number of pages in the Starr report and
listed the 11 allegedly impeachable offenses, but recounted none of
the president's sexual encounters. In fact, the paper offered more
space to the White House rebuttal. ``President Clinton has admitted
his mistake and apologized on many occasions in the past few
days,'' the article concluded, ``and in the meantime, he has
instructed his lawyers to make an effort to defend him.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior editor at a Communist Party paper said that the party's
propaganda department had instructed the country's news outlets to
refrain from commentary. The Beijing Evening News made no mention
of oral sex.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, in Iran, where sex is not a matter of public
discourse, the major newspapers did not editorialize about
Clinton's alleged attempts to cover up his relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky. Most reports politely referred to Clinton's
``relationship with the White House intern,'' although one
newspaper, Kayan, broke ranks with a story charging that ``the
report on Clinton's moral case shocked Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   In Hong Kong, the editorial pages generally focused on whether
the investigation by the independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, would
affect world financial markets, with Apple Daily, the island's most
popular Chinese-language daily, expressing concern that Clinton's
troubles came at a moment when the world's fragile stock markets
needed strong leadership from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But elsewhere, the Fourth Estate had great fun.
</P>
<P>
   In India, newspapers were not the least bit reluctant to print
the sensational minutiae of Starr's report _ ``Clinton Adrift in a
Sea of Smut,'' screamed a headline in The Indian Express _ and some
leading opinion makers there seemed eager to see him leave office.
</P>
<P>
   The Pioneer, a New Delhi-based paper that has vociferously
defended India's explosion of nuclear devices, wrote in an
editorial Sunday that few would shed tears over the departure of a
president whose administration had ``acted like an outraged bully
over the nuclear tests in Pokhran in May.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, most newspapers depicted the leader of the world's most
powerful nation as a man reduced by his own hubris. ``By his
monumental effort to hide the truth and subvert evidence,''
declared The Hindu, in its lead editorial Saturday, `` Clinton lost
the trust of his people, lost his own moral authority to rule.''
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico City, news of the Starr report led five of the most
important papers in Saturday editions, with several describing an
encounter between Clinton and Monica Lewinsky on the night before
his dinner meeting with Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo.
``Zedillo One of Several World Leaders Present During the Sexual
Adventures,'' read one headline in La Jornada, a leading leftist
daily there.
</P>
<P>
   In Argentina, the front page of Pagina 12, a leading daily, on
Saturday carried a drawing of Clinton, dressed in nothing but a
tie, polka-dotted with lipstick left by kisses.
</P>
<P>
   If foreign media outlets lampooned Clinton's fate, they also
poked fun at what they regarded as the prudishness of the American
public.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, for instance, ordinary people and professional
pundits found themselves flummoxed by the prospect that the leader
of the world's most powerful country might be forced out of office
because of sexual improprieties.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is harder to say which is more grotesque,'' pondered the
Stuttgarter Zeitung in an editorial. ``Clinton's dumb attempts to
free himself from his liaison and his lies, or the venomous
investigation of special prosecutor Starr, a fevered hunt in the
name of hypocritical morals.''
</P>
<P>
   All weekend long, the Starr report dominated the front page of
every German newspaper and television talk show. Welt am Sonntag,
the nationally distributed Sunday publication, set aside two pages
for a German translation of the report. Only one newspaper called
on the U.S. president to resign. ``Clinton is a president without
his pants on,'' railed a front-page editorial in the conservative
Frankfurter Allgemeine on Saturday. ``A philanderer is not a good
occupant for the White House.''

 &HT;    Although McGwire got to 62 first, Sosa was never far behind
 &HT;    By Mark Bradley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mark McGwire got there first, but McGwire mightn't have made it
without Sammy Sosa. And now Sosa's there, too, but Sosa mightn't
have done it without McGwire. How towering was Roger Maris' record?
So tall that it took two men to surmount it.
</P>
<P>
   Think back to Aug. 19, a day game in Wrigley. McGwire had
managed but two home runs in three weeks. Sosa had drawn even at
47, which is a slew of homers but still miles from 62. On that
Wednesday the Great Chase again took flight, Sosa hitting his 48th
to pull momentarily ahead, McGwire answering with Nos. 48 and 49.
</P>
<P>
   That was the day everything changed, and not just numerically.
McGwire had begun to chafe under the growing scrutiny, grumpily
admonishing the traveling media throng to ''worry about your
families.'' Thirty-seven years ago, in a era not yet cable-ready,
Maris had seen his hair infamously fall out; with 10 times the
exposure and 20 times the number of interrogators, would the
redhead be bald by September?
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, no. This had to do not just with McGwire but
with Sosa. Those around the Cardinals insist that the week that
took McGwire to Chicago was a week of transformation. Said Dave
Parker, once a hitter of renown and now the Cards' batting coach:
''Mac was getting fed up. But then he was around Sammy and his
outgoing personality, and he saw how he was handling things. And
largely because of that, he loosened up.''
</P>
<P>
   By nightfall that Sunday, a conspicuously sunnier McGwire had
hit four more. Even the Androstenedione Affair, which broke that
weekend while he was in New York, couldn't dim the glow. Without
Sosa to serve as an object lesson, would McGwire have reached 62?
Perhaps, but not nearly so soon. For one man assaulting the record
alone, September would have been a long, slow slog.
</P>
<P>
   The flip side: Without McGwire to run interference and draw the
hordes -- on the weekend some 600 writers assembled in St. Louis to
see McGwire hit No. 61, Sosa hit his 58th before an unpacked press
box in Pittsburgh -- Sosa might well have seen his trademark
enthusisiasm diminished. Even as he was slipstreaming behind
McGwire, Sosa kept insisting, only a bit disingenuously, that
''Mark is the man.'' But now, after a week that saw a 62nd homer
launched not once but twice, it seems clear that each man needed
the other.
</P>
<P>
   Maris had company until September, until an ailing Mickey Mantle
left him alone in pursuit. Then it was just one man against Babe
Ruth and history, against Ford Frick and his asterisk. Even as
McGwire smacked 61 and then 62, he was never really alone. Sosa was
in the same ballpark, his at-bats furnishing their own drama, his
presence giving the media something else to chronicle, his
responses to McGwire's blasts serving as slices of sporting grace.
</P>
<P>
   So genuine was Sosa in his esteem for McGwire that you wanted
him to have his moment as well, and his came Sunday. If it was
decidedly lower-key than McGwire's, it was no less momentous. So
what if, in the chronicle of the 1998 season, Sosa gets cast as
Buzz Aldrin to McGwire's Neil Armstrong? Like those lunar
explorers, these cosmic sluggers formed a historic team.

   WESTFIELD, N.J. _ It was a glorious late-summer Sunday in this
prosperous, largely Republican and now fed-up pocket of America.
The soccer teams played at Memorial Park, the Sunday School of the
Congregationalist Church posed for pictures, the line at Starbucks
was long. And when the talk turned to President Clinton, as it
usually did, parents asked their children to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kerry, go over by Daddy, please,'' Christine Foley, 37, told
her 10-year-old daughter at Memorial Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, fine,'' Kerry responded. ``I know what you're up to,
though.''
</P>
<P>
   Out of earshot, Mrs. Foley _ a Republican, stay-at-home mother
of four children and wife of a lawyer _ talked about what she
considered the ``disgusting'' sexual details in the report of the
independent counsel, Kenneth Starr. But in remarks that echoed the
views of many of her neighbors, she also said that Starr's report
never should have been put on the Internet, and that the report
only confirmed the negative opinion she already had of Clinton's
character.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely don't think he should be impeached,'' she added.
``I think I'd like to see him resign.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked why, she paused. ``You're asking a good question, because
I'm still confused about it,'' she said. ``I guess the only way to
get past this is if he removes himself from the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Seven months ago, shortly after Clinton was accused of having an
affair with Monica Lewinsky, The New York Times asked residents of
Westfield, a predominately white suburb of 29,000 about 25 miles
west of Manhattan, what they thought of the president. Many of the
three dozen people randomly interviewed said then that they didn't
respect Clinton personally but liked the job he was doing as
president _ a view mirrored at the time in national polls, when
Clinton was enjoying record approval ratings. Westfield residents
also said that Clinton's private life, no matter how troubling,
should not be of public concern.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, in two dozen random interviews with other residents of
Westfield, the situation seemed to have changed. Although people
still said they considered Clinton a good president, they seemed
less willing to look past his personal behavior.
</P>
<P>
   But they said their disillusionment was rooted in Clinton's lies
about the affair, not in the explicit sexual details they read over
the weekend in Starr's report. ``He's a womanizer, but he always
was,'' said Chris Fraites, 40, a commodities trader and an
independent who voted for Clinton. ``That didn't shock anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   No one interviewed said that Clinton should be impeached because
of Ms. Lewinsky, although many said he ought to resign. A few
others, all Democrats, said that calling for resignation was
premature. Democrats also accused Starr of conducting a ``witch
hunt,'' and said they were angry about the time and money he spent.
</P>
<P>
   The conversations always came back to Clinton's untruthfulness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am so disappointed in his having lied in January,'' said
Michelle Ehrich, 38, an independent voter and an investment
banker-turned-author who was selling gift certificates on the
opening day of the religious school at Westfield's Temple Emanu-el.
``I'm having a hard time getting past that. Even though I thought
the investigation was improper, I find it difficult to fathom that
someone could have made such a vehement and emotional denial. He
lied to not only the nation but his closest friends, advisers and
family, standing up there shaking his finger. I'm so upset about
that.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, nobody in what Ms. Ehrich called ``a Harold Robbins
novel'' _ from the president to Ms. Lewinsky to Starr _ got much
sympathy in Westfield. Fraites, who gives Treasury Secretary Robert
Rubin credit for the good economy, was especially angry at Starr.
</P>
<P>
   ``It started out as a Whitewater investigation, and you don't
hear much about that now,'' he said. ``Along the way, he finds out
the president had an affair with an intern. And now the taxpayers
are spending millions of dollars to find out about the president's
sex life. I don't like that. That should be Hillary's problem.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky did not fare well in Westfield, either. If the
report did anything, at least based on the two dozen people
interviewed, it provided a far more unflattering picture of a woman
who people no longer seem to view as a simple victim.
</P>
<P>
   ``She really did come on to him,'' said Amy Margulies, 43, a
Democrat and a former executive of a clothing company, who was at
Starbucks with her daughter, Arielle, nearly 2. ``I do think this
was a hot 22-year-old who forced her way. Yeah, he's the president
of the United States, he should be strong enough. But he's a man.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Margulies paused. ``I guess that is really anti-feminist of
me,'' she said, apologetically.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Moore, 58, a Democrat and a teacher of the handicapped,
agreed that Ms. Lewinsky is no role model. ``What a disservice to
women,'' she said, walking with her 2-year-old grandson, Alec,
outside the Presbyterian Church of Westfield. ``As a woman, I hold
her responsible for her actions. She had every opportunity in life,
and then she made decisions so that she ended up where she ended
up. I have no respect and sympathy for that. I teach kids who come
from places with far less, and they are able to do more for
themselves and society.''
</P>
<P>
   Laing Sisto, 34, a Democrat whose father, Paul Rogers, was a
congressman from Florida, was more tolerant of Ms. Lewinsky _
``you're so naive and the president of the United States is
lavishing attention on you'' _ and thought Clinton should resign.
``He lied to protect his family,'' she said. ``But if you're the
president of the United States, you can't do that under oath.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sisto, the mother of four children, also said that Clinton
will leave a sad legacy. ``Yesterday, I was talking to a
neighbor,'' she said. ``We both have 8-year-olds. And he said, `My
daughter will remember President Clinton as the one who had the
girlfriend.'''
</P>
<P>
   Discussions of Starr's report did create some debate at
Starbucks. ``It was pretty graphic,'' said Richard Geiger, 37, a
Republican who is a lawyer and an engineer at Merck
Pharmaceuticals. ``My first question as a lawyer is, how does she
remember in such detail?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Margulies was listening at a nearby table. ``What, are you
kidding?'' she said to a reporter a few minutes later, recalling
Geiger's remark. ``I'd remember every single thing.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ By the time Richard Nixon faced impeachment
proceedings in Congress a generation ago, many of his closest aides
had already been indicted or convicted of crimes.
</P>
<P>
   In stunning contrast, the independent counsel, Kenneth Starr,
has built an impeachment case against President Clinton over a
series of incidents involving Monica Lewinsky in which no criminal
charges have been filed against anyone. At least not yet.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said Sunday that the impeachment report sent to
Congress last week was far from the last step in their examination.
It is not known to what end they are working, but grand juries in
Washington and Virginia are continuing their examinations into
aspects of the Lewinsky inquiry that Starr apparently thought did
not need to be resolved before filing his report with Congress last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the impeachment referral, while painfully detailed about
many intimate aspects of the relationship between Clinton and a
former White House intern, left unresolved several issues that have
emerged in recent months, including these:
</P>
<P>
   _ Did Clinton lie under oath regarding accusations by a White
House volunteer, Kathleen Willey, that Clinton groped her in the
White House in 1993? Did Nathan Landow, a prominent Maryland real
estate developer and Democratic fund-raiser, who talked to Ms.
Willey after the incident, try to influence her testimony? Landow
has denied he violated any laws.
</P>
<P>
   _ What was the role of the deputy White House counsel, Bruce
Lindsey, when he talked to witnesses in the Lewinsky case and the
Paula Corbin Jones case? The White House has appealed to the
Supreme Court a decision in which a federal appeals court said the
president could not invoke lawyer-client privilege to shield
Lindsey from answering questions.
</P>
<P>
   _ Did Linda Tripp alter or duplicate portions of the tapes she
made of her conversations with Ms. Lewinsky, her Pentagon
colleague, despite Ms. Tripp's testimony to the contrary? Did Ms.
Tripp break Maryland law when she surreptitiously recorded
telephone conversations without Ms. Lewinsky's consent? Maryland
authorities are examining that question.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Starr's office said Sunday that the areas not
addressed in the referral were not essential to reaching
conclusions about whether Clinton might have committed impeachable
offenses.
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel law requires Starr to issue a referral
to the House of Representatives once he has ``substantial and
credible information'' that ``may constitute grounds for
impeachment.'' The law gives no guidance about the timing of such a
referral, although another provision requires that once his inquiry
is over, Starr must give a formal accounting of his entire
investigation to the special court that appointed him.
</P>
<P>
   While its precise timing is still unknown, the report to the
court is certain to provide information about what Starr has
learned throughout his sprawling inquiry. These include the
dismissal of the White House travel office staff in 1993 and the
administration's use of background files compiled by the FBI about
former Republican officials.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has also not provided his conclusions into the four-year
examination of the ties in the 1980s between Clinton, Hillary
Rodham Clinton and a corrupt savings and loan association in
Arkansas that was owned and operated by James and Susan McDougal,
the Clintons' business partners in the Whitewater land venture.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McDougal has been indicted by a federal grand jury in
Arkansas for refusing to answer its questions. She is also a
defendant in a case in California in which she is accused of
embezzling $150,000 from the conductor Zubin Mehta and his wife,
Nancy.
</P>
<P>
   The only other outstanding case brought by the independent
counsel involves Webster Hubbell, the former associate attorney
general. Prosecutors are appealing the dismissal of a tax-evasion
indictment against Hubbell involving income that he received from
friends of the president.
</P>
<P>
   In his impeachment referral, Starr wrote that ``all phases of
the investigation are now nearing completion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This office will soon make final decisions about what steps to
take, if any, with respect to the other information it has
gathered,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   While the impeachment referral inflicted considerable political
damage, it also had the practical effect of clearing a number of
Clinton aides of committing crimes.
</P>
<P>
   By concluding that the president had lied to them, the referral
suggested that they had had no role in any cover-up and that they
did not violate the law when they testified that Clinton did not
have a sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. The crime of perjury
requires as one of its elements that the person testifying know
that the testimony is untruthful.
</P>
<P>
   But the referral may also pose new problems for Clinton outside
of Congress. In particular, it could prompt possible sanctions from
the federal judge in Arkansas who dismissed Mrs. Jones' lawsuit
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, Susan Webber Wright, wrote two weeks ago that she had
concerns about Clinton's January deposition after he acknowledged
that he had had an inappropriate relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Wright indicated that she could find Clinton in contempt of
court for failing to detail his relationship but had not decided
what to do.

BORDICK HELPS ORIOLES SWEEP ANGELS
</HEADLINE>

 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Move over Dave Henderson, make room for the latest
Angels killer: Mike Bordick.
</P>
<P>
   For the second game in a row, Baltimore's No. 9 hitter came up
with the key hit as the Orioles swept the Angels in the three-game
series at Camden Yards.
</P>
<P>
   Bordick, whose two-run homer off Troy Percival keyed a
ninth-inning rally Saturday, hit a two-out, two-run, bases-loaded
single off Pep Harris in the seventh inning Sunday to give the
Orioles a three-run lead on the way to a 12-7 victory before
48,013.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the loss, the Angels held on to their one-game lead in
the AL West, because Texas also lost, 10-5 to Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, the Angels insisted there was no time for
feeling sorry for themselves. Even though they were swept, they
still hold first place with 14 to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to look at a positive thing, yeah, that's about as
positive as you can get,'' Angels manager Terry Collins said.
``We're fortunate. You don't worry about (being swept). We're still
in first place. That's what I told them. Forget about the last
three days.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not going to find anybody at their locker crying,''
pitcher Chuck Finley said. ``If you're looking into your locker
trying to find answers, you're not going to find it there. It's out
on the field. There isn't a player in here who doesn't know what's
at stake here.''
</P>
<P>
   There's not much at stake for the Orioles, who, despite lofty
expectations and the major leagues' highest payroll, struggled
early in the season and couldn't make up the ground. But they still
have one of the most feared lineups in the league, right down to
their No. 9 hitter, Bordick.
</P>
<P>
   Bordick's hit Sunday was a crusher for the Angels because it
essentially nullified their rally from a 7-1 deficit. The Angels
scored three in the fifth, one in the sixth and two in the seventh
to tie the game at 7. But in the bottom of the seventh, the Orioles
took an 8-7 lead on Rafael Palmeiro's RBI double off Jarrod
Washburn (5-3).
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles still had runners on second and third with nobody
out and threatened to score more when Harris came in. He nearly
escaped. Harris got Cal Ripken on a groundout and intentionally
walked B.J. Surhoff to load the bases, then struck out Chris Hoiles
for the second out.
</P>
<P>
   Bordick, though, jumped on Harris' first pitch and lined a
single to left field, scoring two runs and breaking the Angels'
spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``All year he has (hurt us),'' Collins said. ``When you face
guys like Bordick and can't get him out, you wonder how anybody
else does. You throw good pitches and he fouls 'em off. You make a
mistake and he hits it.''
</P>
<P>
   Angels starter Jack McDowell put the Angels in a big hole to
begin with, giving up six runs (five earned) and five hits in 21/3
innings, his shortest outing of the season. McDowell gave up all
six runs in the third inning as the Orioles took a 6-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   And now it's on to Tampa Bay, an expansion team, but one that
just beat Texas two of three.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no relief,'' shortstop Gary DiSarcina said. ``We're in
a pennant race and we don't have many games left. We've still got a
one-game lead. We're fighting for our lives out there.''

ANGELS' McDOWELL STRUGGLES 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ For Jack McDowell, his five starts since coming back
from elbow problems have been either feast or famine.
</P>
<P>
   McDowell lasted only 21/3 innings and gave up six runs and five
hits Sunday, but didn't get the loss because the Angels rallied to
tie the game before eventually losing. But it continued a trend of
hit or miss for McDowell since his 2{ months on the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   He has been spectacular in three of his starts, horrible in the
other two. In his three wins, his starts have gone like this: 7
innings, 0 runs, 5 hits; 7 innings, 2 runs, 6 hits; 62/3 innings, 1
run, 6 hits. All were victories.
</P>
<P>
   His bad starts have gone like this: 3 innings, 5 runs, 6 hits;
21/3 innings, 6 runs, 5 hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why, I don't know what the reason is,'' said
McDowell, 4-3 with a 4.66 ERA overall this season. ``(The bad
starts) all happened early. I didn't have a chance to get into a
flow really. And still, it's not like I can't stop it before I give
up six runs.''
</P>
<P>
   McDowell gave up all six runs in the third inning Sunday and
didn't get out of the inning. It wasn't as though he got hit hard _
he gave up three hits in the inning, including a bunt single _ but
the walks killed him. In the third inning alone, he walked four
(one intentionally). Overall, he walked five.
</P>
<P>
   ``It turned into an ugly inning,'' he said. ``At some point I'm
going to have to learn what I can do when I get behind (in the
count). When I've pitched well, I've gotten ahead in the count.''
</P>
<P>
   Off the Hill: Pitcher Ken Hill won't make his scheduled start
tonight against Tampa Bay because of inflammation in his right
elbow. Omar Olivares will go instead.
</P>
<P>
   But Hill, who had surgery on the elbow June 15, will make a
start Friday in Anaheim against the Mariners. Hill felt some
soreness in his elbow after his last start, Wednesday in Anaheim,
and felt it again Saturday during his between-starts workout.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Terry Collins said Hill's soreness could be a result of
the line drive he deflected with his right hand in Wednesday's
game. Hill suffered two bruised fingers and a bruised thumb, but
continued to pitch, facing two more batters before being removed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could have been when he hurt his hand he changed his
delivery,'' Collins said. ``Change the grip on the ball and it
affects the muscles in his arm.''
</P>
<P>
   Waiting for Erstad: The Angels are hopeful Darin Erstad
(strained left hamstring) will be ready to play by Friday, when the
Angels begin a six-game homestand against Seattle and Texas, their
final homestand of the season.
</P>
<P>
   But while they are hopeful, they say they aren't counting on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to put pressure on Darin Erstad to try to come
back for the next homestand,'' Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels are 3-5 since Erstad hurt his hamstring Sept. 2.

FORGIVE AND MOVE ON, GORE SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ President Clinton has spoken deeply to ``redemption
and repentance, atonement and forgiveness'' and should be allowed
to stay in office and get on with the country's business, Vice
President Al Gore said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who would inherit the White House if Clinton resigns or is
impeached, played the role of loyalist and understanding understudy
Sunday during a closely watched political visit to Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   He praised Clinton's speech to a White House prayer breakfast
last Friday as showing the depth of the president's contrition. He
argued that the report of special prosecutor Kenneth Starr does not
justify the drastic step of removing a twice-elected president from
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought his speech (Friday) was perhaps the best of his
presidency,'' said Gore. ``In his manner of responding to this
issue, he has addressed very deep subjects like redemption and
repentance, atonement and forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``In accepting responsibility for doing what he acknowledged was
wrong and indefensible, he has asked both for forgiveness and the
ability to move to problems facing the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I personally believe that even though the
president's lawyers will respond to specifics in the Starr report,
there is nothing in that report that justifies overturning the
judgment of the American people in 1992 and 1996 that Bill Clinton
should be president of this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore was interviewed by the Post-Intelligencer after completing
a 5 kilometer ``Race for the Cure'' run against breast cancer at
the University of Washington. The vice president took just over 30
minutes to run just over three miles.
</P>
<P>
   Gore kept up a breakneck pace through the day. He packed in four
fundraisers, a meeting with key local supporters of his anticipated
presidential bid, and a discussion about how to restore imperiled
Northwest salmon runs.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president also challenged GOP Sen. Slade Gorton. Gorton
recently attacked Gore, claiming he favors imposed federal
solutions to Northwest environmental problems. Gorton has hinted
that Gore might support removing some dams from the Columbia River
system to save salmon.
</P>
<P>
   Gore mixed wit and serious argument in a spirited counterattack
yesterday. He suggested attacks from the Republican senator are ``a
case of his hostility toward the environment spilling over toward
me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He must have been bitten by a squirrel as a child,'' Gore
added, referring to Gorton's often vociferous criticism of the
Endangered Species Act.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was strongly critical of provisions that Gorton has
inserted into a pending spending bill for U.S. Departments of
Interior, Agriculture and Energy. The riders cover everything from
management of Columbia and Snake River dams to prohibiting
completion of a management plan for federal lands in the Columbia
Basin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our view is that this policy should not be made in Washington,
D.C., behind closed doors by lawyers and lobbyists for big
polluters, but instead should be made by the people of the region
coming together in a science-based process that fosters harmony and
accommodates all the interests that have to be reconciled,'' Gore
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore met with those interests yesterday. In a broiling sun in
front of Bell Harbor Conference Center, he presided over a lengthy
discussion of salmon involving state, local and tribal leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was ready to be pleased. He promised that ``a single
proposal for salmon recovery for the region'' will be included in
the Clinton administration's proposed fiscal year 2000 budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``Answers won't come from Washington, D.C., but Washington
state,'' said Gore.

CLINTON'S PUBLIC ACTS AND SECRET TRYSTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ROBERT D. McFADDEN, JOHN KIFNER and N.R. KLEINFIELD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For Bill Clinton, as for all presidents, the White House has
always been a stage, the symbol of national power and executive
authority, its stately rooms reflecting America's noblest
aspirations. In the Oval Office, presidents have faced questions of
war and peace and the welfare of the people. They have also used
the elegant setting for less lofty purposes, as a political
platform and as a place to charm the rich and powerful for campaign
contributions or votes.
</P>
<P>
   But the White House has developed a lurid backstage life in
recent years, as investigators have learned, with sexual encounters
between President Clinton and a young intern in rooms just off the
Oval Office, with trysts stolen between the bill signings, the
state dinners and meetings with government officials and foreign
dignitaries.
</P>
<P>
   On 10 days between Nov. 15, 1995, and March 29, 1997 _ 10 days
reconstructed in this article _ he wove into his schedule a series
of sexual rendezvous with Monica Lewinsky, according to Kenneth
Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   While the Starr report did not tote up the precise amount of
time the president and Ms. Lewinsky spent together, their
encounters apparently occupied less than 10 hours over the span of
16 months, even though Ms. Lewinsky's life appears to have been
dominated by her obsession with the president.
</P>
<P>
   The encounters began, by Starr's account, in the course of the
nation's business: eye-contact at ceremonial functions, a
flirtatious exchange or two, then a meeting one night when the
White House staff was cut drastically by a shutdown of the federal
government in a budget impasse, and interns were brought in to
help.
</P>
<P>
   The first sexual encounter took place in the waning hours of a
day on which Clinton signed a ``Family Week'' proclamation and an
appropriations bill, conferred with aides on negotiations to end
the war in Bosnia and tried to cope with the government shutdown.
He saw Ms. Lewinsky working alone in an aide's office, invited her
into the Oval Office and began with a kiss.
</P>
<P>
   Later on, the encounters were less happenstance, increasingly
orchestrated, the Starr report says. In an often blunt narrative
intended as an argument for Congress to impeach the president, the
report offers passages of seamy details and subterfuges that read
like pulp fiction.
</P>
<P>
   The cast of Secret Service agents, secretaries and assistants
who protect and serve the president in his official role were
clearly aware of the backstage activities, according to the Starr
report, but in many cases chose to avert their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Several encounters were interrupted by phone calls, and one by
the entrance of an aide, Harold Ickes, which sent Ms. Lewinsky into
a panicky flight out a rear door, the report says. Toward the end
of their relationship, it says, Ms. Lewinsky pleaded repeatedly to
see Clinton, but was rebuffed. Finally they met again, but the
report says the president had no time for sex: He had to rush off
for a state dinner with President Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   NOV. 15, 1995
</P>
<P>
   It was not a routine Wednesday for Clinton, because a budget
impasse with Congress had shut down the federal government, and
800,000 federal workers were staying home for a second day,
including over 80 percent of the White House staff.
</P>
<P>
   The president had no public events scheduled, and he did not
leave the White House. But he had meetings with aides, as well as
with three senators and a group of farmers; an appropriations bill
and several proclamations to sign and an interview with a
television network.
</P>
<P>
   And there were major foreign problems on his mind. In Dayton,
Ohio, negotiations to end the Bosnian war were at a critical stage.
In view of the budget problem and the government shutdown, the
president was grappling with another problem: whether to go through
with a long-planned trip to Tokyo the coming weekend for a
pan-Asian economic conference.
</P>
<P>
   For days, his aides had debated the pros and cons of the trip,
which was intended to ease rising tensions over economic issues.
Foreign policy advisers argued he should go and not risk new
tensions with Japan, or appear to be held hostage by congressional
Republicans over the budget. But domestic advisers had warned him
of congressional mischief in his absence.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton early in the day decided to send Vice President Al Gore
instead. His announcement would say he could not be away from
Washington at such a delicate time. But sensitive to Japanese
feelings, he delayed the public announcement until evening _ that
would be morning in Tokyo _ so he could first inform Prime Minister
Tomiichi Murayama personally in a telephone call.
</P>
<P>
   Dealing with the budget matters, Clinton spoke to Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin, who averted a national default by taking
$61 billion from two civil service retirement funds (and replacing
the funds with IOUs) to cover interest payments on the national
debt and other bills coming due, including Social Security
payments.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the CBS anchor, Dan Rather, Clinton struck
a defiant note against the Republican budget priorities, saying he
would not give in to their ``huge cuts in Medicare, Medicaid,
education, the environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton signed three proclamations, for National Family Week,
National Farm-City Week and National Great American Smokeout Day,
which was to be the next day, Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Family Week proclamation cited a ``shared commitment to the
importance of family life,'' in which Americans ``first learn
important lessons about responsibility.'' He called for greater
efforts to prevent substance abuse, domestic violence and teen-age
pregnancy that ``threaten the well-being of our young people.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House was unusually quiet throughout the day because
the federal shutdown had furloughed all but essential employees. As
a result, the White House staff of 430 had shrunk to only 90
people. Moreover, some were White House interns, who could continue
working because they were not paid.
</P>
<P>
   Many, including Ms. Lewinsky, who ordinarily worked in the Old
Executive Office Building near the White House, took on a wide
range of added duties that brought them into the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky, who had begun her internship in July 1995,
testified before the grand jury that after about a month she began
making eye contact with the president at a number of White House
functions, and both began what she characterized as ``intense
flirting.''
</P>
<P>
   At departure ceremonies and other events, she recalled, she
shook Clinton's hand and introduced herself. Later, when she ran
into the president in the White House West Wing, she introduced
herself again, and, she testified, he responded that he already
knew who she was.
</P>
<P>
   While Ms. Lewinsky's regular job was to work on correspondence
in the office of the chief of staff, Leon Panetta, in the Old
Executive Office Building, she was assigned during the one-week
federal shutdown to answer phones and run errands in Panetta's
office in the West Wing.
</P>
<P>
   On this day, as on other days during the federal shutdown,
Clinton went frequently to Panetta's office, and sometimes talked
with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   At 1:30 p.m., according to the White House logs, Ms. Lewinsky
entered the White House. The logs do not show the time of her
departure that afternoon, and the Starr report did not say whether
Ms. Lewinsky and Clinton encountered one another during the early
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   At about 3:15 p.m., Clinton met with the Senate minority leader,
Tom Daschle, D-S.D., and Sens. Byron Dorgan and Kent Conrad, both
Democrats of North Dakota, and six Dakota farmers. The president
told them he would fight steep cuts in farm subsidies that were
being advanced by Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   At 5:07 p.m., according to logs cited by the Starr report, Ms.
Lewinsky re-entered the White House and resumed work in Panetta's
office; her departure from the White House was logged at 12:18 a.m.
During virtually the same time frame _ 5:01 p.m. to 12:35 a.m.,
Clinton was in the Oval Office or in Panetta's office, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
   That evening, the report said, the president and Ms. Lewinsky
``made eye contact'' when he went to Panetta's office, and again
later at an informal birthday party for Jennifer Palmieri, a
special assistant to Panetta. At one point, they were alone in the
office and, according to the report, ``in the course of flirting
with him, she raised her jacket in the back and showed him the
straps of her thong underwear.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometime before 8 p.m., when the White House spokesman announced
that the president had canceled his trip to Japan, Clinton spent 20
minutes on the phone with Murayama in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   At about 8 p.m., as Ms. Lewinsky walked to a restroom, she
passed the office of a presidential adviser, George Stephanopoulos,
the Starr report said. ``The president was inside alone, and he
beckoned her to enter,'' it went on. ``She told him that she had a
crush on him. He laughed, then asked if she would like to see his
private office.''
</P>
<P>
   He led her through a connecting door into the president's
private dining room and toward his private study off the Oval
Office. Ms. Lewinsky testified: ``We talked briefly and sort of
acknowledged that there had been a chemistry that was there before
and that we were both attracted to each other, and then he asked me
if he could kiss me.''
</P>
<P>
   In the windowless hallway adjacent to the study, they kissed,
the report said, and before returning to her desk she wrote down
her name and telephone number for the president.
</P>
<P>
   That evening, Clinton signed a $36.9 billion appropriations bill
to provide money for the Department of Transportation and related
agencies for the fiscal year that had begun on Oct. 1. The sum was
only $1.4 billion less than the Clinton administration had sought
from Congress, and the White House expressed hearty satisfaction
with the outcome of the bipartisan bill.
</P>
<P>
   The Starr report quoted Ms. Lewinsky as saying she was alone in
Panetta's office at about 10 p.m. when the president walked in. He
invited her to rendezvous again in Stephanopoulos' office in a few
minutes and she agreed, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   They again returned to the private study and ``this time the
lights in the study were off,'' the report said. After a kiss, it
said, a sexual encounter ensued. Because the study had uncovered
windows, it took place, as did others later, in the windowless
hallway adjacent to the study, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   ``During many of their sexual encounters, the president stood
leaning against the doorway of the bathroom across from the study,
which, he told Ms. Lewinsky, eased his sore back,'' the report
said.
</P>
<P>
   During the encounter, the telephone rang; the president answered
it in the study, and, while the sexual encounter continued there,
he talked with a person Ms. Lewinsky took to be a member of
Congress, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   White House records show Clinton talked to Democratic Reps. Jim
Chapman Jr. of Texas from 9:25 to 9:30 p.m., and John Tanner of
Tennessee from 9:31 to 9:35 p.m., but no mention of a call after 10
p.m. was made. Before and after the sexual episode, the report
said, Ms. Lewinsky and Clinton talked.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one point during the conversation,'' the report said, ``the
president tugged on the pink intern pass hanging from her neck and
said that it might be a problem. Ms. Lewinsky thought that he was
talking about access _ interns were not supposed to be in the West
Wing without an escort _ and, in addition, that he might have
discerned some `impropriety' in a sexual relationship with a White
House intern.''
</P>
<P>
   The duration of the conversation was unclear from the Starr
report, which noted only that Ms. Lewinsky left the White House
after midnight, and the president was logged out of the Oval Office
a short time later.

   NOV. 17, 1995
</P>
<P>
   The biggest government shutdown in history was in its fourth day
as the sharply diminished White House staff tried to cope with the
heavy flow of presidential pronouncements, correspondence,
meetings, interviews and other activities.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to get the federal behemoth moving again, Clinton, as his
first task of the morning, sent Congress a stopgap financing bill
to get 800,000 federal employees back to work, but he gave no
ground in the budget impasse, warning that he would veto the
Republicans' latest spending plan.
</P>
<P>
   Panetta shuttled about Capitol Hill, seeking a deal, but the
Republicans, led by House Speaker Newt Gingrich, refused to
compromise on their plans for huge budget cuts, tax cuts and a
balanced budget in seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Gathering all the support he could muster, the president met at
the White House with a delegation from the Leadership Council of
Aging Organizations, representing 41 consumer, research and trade
groups. They urged him to veto any bill that would cut money for
older Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also had a 15-minute Oval Office meeting with Alaska's
Democratic governor, Tony Knowles, who tried without success to
persuade the president that oil drilling would have no long-term
ill effects in an Arctic wildlife refuge in his state.
</P>
<P>
   The president also acted on several foreign-affairs matters. He
rebuked Congress over a Republican-sponsored bill to bar spending
to deploy American troops to Bosnia, saying it could torpedo the
peace talks in Ohio. In a lengthy telephone call, he talked with
President Nelson Mandela of South Africa about a tough multilateral
response to Nigeria's hanging of nine human rights advocates,
including Ken Saro-Wiwa, the writer.
</P>
<P>
   And in an Oval Office interview with Japanese journalists,
Clinton said he would reschedule his state visit to Japan but was
vague about the timing. ``I will come as soon as I can,'' he said.
``This is very, very important to me. I hope the Japanese people
will understand this is no expression of disrespect by me, either
to the government nor the people of Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said the United States' overall military commitment to
Japan (47,000 troops) and the Asia-Pacific rim (100,000 troops)
would not be diminished, despite calls for reductions in the wake
of the rape of a Japanese girl in Okinawa, in which three American
servicemen had been accused.
</P>
<P>
   On this Friday night, two days after what Ms. Lewinsky said had
been their first sexual encounter, both Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky
worked late. White House logs show she checked out at 8:56 p.m. but
returned at 9:38 p.m. for a little over an hour, according to
Starr's report. She was still working in Panetta's West Wing
office.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that at 9:45 p.m., Clinton stepped into
Panetta's office for one minute, and then returned to the Oval
Office. Because they were working late, Betty Currie, the
president's personal secretary, and other staff members had sent
out for pizza, Ms. Lewinsky recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went down to let them know that the pizza was there, and it
was at that point when I walked into Mrs. Currie's office that the
president was standing there with some other people discussing
something,'' Ms. Lewinsky testified. ``And they all came back to
the office, and Mr. _ I think it was Mr. Toiv _ somebody
accidentally knocked pizza on my jacket, so I went to go use the
restroom to wash it off, and as I was coming out of the restroom,
the president was standing in Mrs. Currie's doorway and said, `You
can come out this way.''' Barry Toiv was Panetta's chief aide.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky and the president went back to the private study
off the Oval Office, and there she and the president kissed, she
testified. After a few minutes, she said, she told him she had to
return to her desk, but Clinton suggested that she bring him some
pizza.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, the report said, she returned to the Oval
Office with the pizza and told Mrs. Currie, who was now back in her
office, that Clinton had asked for the pizza. Mrs. Currie opened
the door for her and said, ``Sir, the girl's here with the pizza.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me to come in,'' Ms. Lewinsky testified. ``Mrs. Currie
went back to her office and then we went into the back study area
again.'' A sexual encounter similar to the first ensued in the
windowless hallway, Ms. Lewinsky related.
</P>
<P>
   While it was taking place, Mrs. Currie approached the hallway
door, which was ajar, and said the president had a phone call, the
Starr report said. It quoted Ms. Lewinsky as saying the caller was
a congressman with a nickname. Records show that Clinton spoke to
Rep. Sonny Callahan, R-Ala., for 21 minutes, from 9:53 p.m. to
10:14 p.m. The sexual encounter continued while the president was
on the phone, the Starr report said.
</P>
<P>
   ``During this visit,'' the report said, ``according to Ms.
Lewinsky, the president told her that he liked her smile and her
energy. He also said: `I'm usually around on weekends, no one else
is around, and you can come and see me.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky was logged out of the White House at 10:39 p.m. The
president went back to the chief of staff's office until 10:34
p.m., and then went by the Oval Office and the ground floor
corridors into the president's private residence at 10:40 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   In his deposition in the Paula Jones case last Jan. 17, the
president said he could not recall most of his encounters with Ms.
Lewinsky, but did remember her ``back there with a pizza'' during
the government shutdown. But he said he did not believe they were
alone.
</P>
<P>
   Testifying before the grand jury on Aug. 17, Clinton said his
first ``real conversation'' with Ms. Lewinsky took place during the
November 1995 furlough. ``One night she brought me some pizza,'' he
testified, according to the Starr report. ``We had some remarks.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   DEC. 31, 1995
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had still not achieved a budget agreement with Congress,
and 280,000 federal workers were on furlough in a second shutdown.
But public opinion polls showed Clinton's approval rating way up,
from a woeful 1994 (as low as 40 percent) to a quite successful
year-end 1995 (in the high 50s).
</P>
<P>
   The reasons were not hard to find: a humming economy, Clinton's
tough stand against unpopular Republican budget cuts, foreign
policy advances in Bosnia, Northern Ireland and the Middle East.
And his longtime political confidant, Dick Morris, was at work
masterminding the 1996 re-election, in which conservative themes
like ``family values'' would play an important role.
</P>
<P>
   It was a quiet Sunday. The president had no scheduled public
appearances, aside from attending early church services. But before
he could leave for a holiday weekend that afternoon with his wife,
Hillary Rodham Clinton, and their daughter, Chelsea, then 15, he
had one meeting on his agenda.
</P>
<P>
   At 9:50 a.m., moments before budget talks in the Cabinet Room,
Clinton and congressional leaders spoke to reporters. There was a
light holiday mood to the exchanges. The president said they were
driving hard to settle the budget impasse and would keep at it.
Reminded that thousands of federal employees were still on
furlough, Sen. Bob Dole, the majority leader, said he and his
colleagues would ``try to pass something.''
</P>
<P>
   Somebody asked: ``Are you closer?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh,'' the Kansas senator said to a roar, ``we're about 6 feet
apart.''
</P>
<P>
   Daschle, to more laughter, added, ``We'll be a lot closer in a
couple of hours.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working at it steady,'' Clinton said, adding, ``Happy
New Year, everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The talks ended at midday, amicably but inconclusively.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton retreated to the Oval Office at 12:11 p.m., the logs
show.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky, by now a staff member in the White House Office of
Legislative Affairs, testified that she was in the pantry of the
president's private dining room, talking to a White House steward,
Bayani Nelvis, sometime between noon and 1 p.m. She told Nelvis
that she had recently smoked her first cigar, and he offered to
give her one of the president's cigars, the Starr report said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just then, the president came down the hallway from the Oval
Office and saw Ms. Lewinsky,'' the report said. ``The president
dispatched Mr. Nelvis to deliver something to Mr. Panetta.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky, the report said, told Clinton that Nelvis had
promised her a cigar, and the president gave her one.
</P>
<P>
   The report went on: ``She told him her name _ she had the
impression that he had forgotten it in the six weeks since their
furlough encounters because, when passing her in the hallway, he
had called her `Kiddo.' The president replied that he knew her
name; in fact, he added, having lost the phone number she had given
him, he had tried to find her in the phone book.''
</P>
<P>
   By Ms. Lewinsky's account, they moved into the private study and
a sexual encounter took place, their third. It followed the pattern
of the first two: It was halted before climax by the president, the
report quoted Ms. Lewinsky as saying. Apparently in explanation, it
said she testified, ``He didn't know me well enough, or he didn't
trust me yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The logs show that Ms. Lewinsky left the White House at 1:16
p.m., and that Clinton went to the White House residence at 1:15
p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the president, Mrs. Clinton, and Chelsea flew to Hilton
Head, S.C., for their traditional year-end family retreat called
Renaissance Weekend. It was their 12th straight year at the
gathering, at which the Clintons partied late on New Year's Eve
with 1,000 of their closest friends, then attended a New Year's Day
seminar on personal growth and family values.

<P>
   JAN. 7, 1996
</P>
<P>
   The blizzard of 1996 had blanketed the East Coast over the
weekend, paralyzing New York, Washington and everything in between.
The president, wearing blue jeans and a red and black checked
shirt, and Mrs. Clinton, in a purple fur-lined hat and a
multicolored winter jacket, were among a few worshippers this
Sunday morning at St. John's Episcopal Church, two blocks from the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring their waiting motorcade, the Clintons trudged home
through calf-high drifts and wind-whipped snowflakes. At one point,
the president playfully scooped up a handful of snow as if to throw
it and cheerfully told reporters that congressional Democrats had
canceled plans to visit him to discuss their continuing budget
confrontation with the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had ended a three-week shutdown of federal programs on
Saturday when he bowed to Republican demands and offered a new
seven-year balanced-budget plan. That triggered congressional
action to finance all government programs, but only through Jan.
26. Still, the Republicans were all over the Sunday morning talk
shows, vowing to balance the budget by 2002 and denouncing the
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very concerned about whether or not there's two snow
jobs going on in Washington,'' Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the
majority whip, said on CBS' ``Face the Nation.'' ``Now we feel like
Charlie Brown, and Lucy has got the football, and every time you
think you're going to get a real budget it gets jerked away from
you.''
</P>
<P>
   On NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, the House
majority whip, was threatening another shutdown, or at least a
cutoff of government services the Republicans did not support.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to fund only those programs we want to fund,''
DeLay said. ``We're in charge. We don't have to negotiate with the
Senate; we don't have to negotiate with the Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans were no less bellicose on the subject of Mrs.
Clinton, accusing her of not telling the truth in the Whitewater
investigation or about the dismissal of aides in the White House
travel office.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's answers are ``not the truth,'' Sen. Alfonse
D'Amato, R-N.Y., said on ABC's ``This Week With David Brinkley.''
``We've had this kind of thing over and over again from her people
who have stonewalled us, who have feigned memory loss.''
</P>
<P>
   One poll showed Clinton trailing Dole, the Republican
front-runner for president, 46 percent to 49 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told reporters he was going to spend the rest of the day
holed up with Panetta and other aides, working on the budget.
</P>
<P>
   But early that afternoon, he telephoned Ms. Lewinsky at her
apartment in the Watergate complex, the first time he had called
her at home, according to the Starr report. He said he was going to
be in his office, she remembered, adding, ``I said, oh, do you want
some company? And he said, oh, that would be great.''
</P>
<P>
   By now, she testified, they had worked out signals for their
encounters. ``I got there kind of saying, `Oh, gee, here are your
letters,' wink, wink, wink, and him saying `OK, that's good,''' she
said. She carried a folder as cover, but her job did not involve
delivering letters.
</P>
<P>
   On this day, Ms. Lewinsky said, they ``made an arrangement that
... he would have the door to his office open, and I would pass by
the office with some papers and then ... he would sort of stop me
and invite me in. So, that was exactly what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   They went to the bathroom of the back study and had a sexual
encounter, she said.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   JAN. 21, 1996
</P>
<P>
   Like the rest of the East Coast, Washington was fighting floods.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel Jordan, the city's director of the Office of Emergency
Preparedness, had been up all night, watching the rain-swollen
Potomac rise nearly 14 feet, twice its usual height, and flooding
part of Georgetown along K Street near the Tidal Basin and the
waterfront fish market. Jordan worried that the river would rise
another foot before it ebbed.
</P>
<P>
   Swollen streams and rivers in eight states had ravaged homes and
businesses. Some of the flooding was receding, but 10,000 residents
were still being evacuated in West Virginia along the surging Ohio
River. About 1,100 homes on Wheeling Island alone were under 6 feet
of water, their 3,000 occupants refugees. Pennsylvania appeared
hardest hit, with homes and businesses submerged or caked in mud,
power and telephone lines down, and debris littering the streets.
Clinton declared the state a federal disaster area, making
available temporary housing, home repair grants and emergency
loans.
</P>
<P>
   On the television talk shows, his opponents attacked him over
the Whitewater investigation, while the House majority leader, Dick
Armey of Texas, threatened to block the nation's ability to borrow
money to pay its bills unless Clinton yielded to Republicans'
budget-cutting to decrease ``the size and intrusiveness of
government.''
</P>
<P>
   On the same show, NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' Panetta protested
the Republican emphasis on Whitewater, saying: ``There is a fine
line between what is a legitimate continuing inquiry into a
situation and what becomes political harassment. I think they're
getting dangerously close to harassment.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point the first family had a private tour for more than
an hour of the wildly popular Vermeer exhibition at the National
Gallery of Art. Accompanied by several friends, including a former
college roommate of Mrs. Clinton, they gazed at the luminous blues
and yellows, the subtle reflected light and the pearly highlights
of the 21 paintings, which represented much of Vermeer's known
output.
</P>
<P>
   The president logged into the Oval Office at 3:33 p.m. Ms.
Lewinsky's name does not appear on the White House logs, but
according to the Starr report, she ran into Clinton in a hallway
near an elevator in the West Wing and he invited her into the Oval
Office. They had had phone sex for the first time the week before,
the report said, and she was ``feeling a little bit insecure''
about whether he had enjoyed it. Eventually, she testified, they
had phone sex on 10 to 15 occasions.
</P>
<P>
   At their meeting this Sunday, Ms. Lewinsky remembered
questioning him about his interest in her, saying, ``I asked him
why he doesn't ask me any questions about myself, and ... is this
just about sex ... or do you have some interest in trying to know
me as a person?'' The president laughed, she said, and replied that
``he cherishes the time that he had with me.'' She thought the
reply was ``a little bit odd,'' because she ``felt like he didn't
really even know me yet.''
</P>
<P>
   As they moved to the hallway by the study, Ms. Lewinsky was in
midsentence when Clinton suddenly kissed her and they had a sexual
encounter.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one point during the encounter, someone entered the Oval
Office,'' the report said, prompting Clinton to leave her in the
hallway.
</P>
<P>
   A short time later, the president was told his next appointment,
a friend from Arkansas, had arrived, and he escorted Ms. Lewinsky
out through a connecting office. She was signed out of the White
House at 3:56 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and his daughter ventured through snow to attend Sunday
morning services at Foundry United Methodist Church, where the
senior minister, J. Philip Wogaman, warned the dozens of government
officials among his congregation not to abuse the public trust by
going on what he called ``power trips.''
</P>
<P>
   A deep freeze gripped much of the South that day, after a week
of snow, ice and record cold blamed for 55 deaths across the lower
48 states. Temperatures hovered around zero in parts of
Mississippi, Georgia and Alabama, and Florida's $1.2 billion citrus
industry was in peril.
</P>
<P>
   It was frosty, too, at the annual meeting of the National
Governors' Conference, which took up part of the President's
official day. At a White House dinner, Republicans eyed the mansion
like house hunters on a real estate tour. Fresh from the attack on
that morning's ``Meet the Press,'' Michigan's Republican governor,
John Engler, said he expected a different party to be in residence
in 1997. ``Next year, I'll arrive in a festive mood,'' he said at
the dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the administration put last-minute touches to a budget
statement due the next day, government officials unveiled data that
showed that Medicare's Hospital Insurance Trust Fund had lost money
in 1995 for the first time in 23 years, meaning the Medicare
program was poorer than anybody thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things turned out a little worse than we expected,'' said
Richard Foster, chief actuary of the Federal Health Care Financing
Administration, which runs Medicare for 37 million people who are
elderly or disabled. In Israel, Prime Minister Shimon Peres leaked
word he planned to call for new elections ahead of schedule. The
elections would bring the hard-line Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu
to power, threatening the Oslo peace accords with the Palestinians
that Clinton hoped would be his enduring foreign policy triumph.
</P>
<P>
   On the bright side, Mrs. Clinton's book, ``It Takes a Village,''
was on the best-seller lists, having soared to No. 1 within a week
of publication.
</P>
<P>
   In the White House, Ms. Lewinsky was in her office, and that
afternoon, she received a phone call from Clinton. Her sexual
encounters with him were usually on the weekend, she said, when
there were fewer people about.
</P>
<P>
   This time, at her suggestion, they bumped into each other in the
hallway because, she said, ``when it happened accidentally, that
seemed to work really well.'' Clinton was in the Oval Office from
3:36 p.m. to 7:05 p.m., logs show; there is no record of Ms.
Lewinsky. They walked together into the private study, where they
had a sexual encounter.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, they sat and talked awhile, maybe 45 minutes, in the
Oval Office, and Ms. Lewinsky testified that she thought their
friendship was starting to blossom. He said he would call her again
and, perhaps mindful of her previous unease, she remembered saying,
``yeah, well, what's my phone number?'' He recited both her home
and office numbers and, the report said, he called her at her desk
later that afternoon to tell her he had enjoyed their time
together.

   MARCH 31, 1996

<P>
   Clinton was looking forward on this Sunday to throwing the first
ball for opening day of the baseball season on Monday at the
Baltimore Orioles' stadium, Camden Yards. But rain delayed the
all-American photo op.
</P>
<P>
   In Russia, President Boris N. Yeltsin, also facing a tough
re-election battle, said he could not win while the war was still
going on in secessionist Chechnya, and he vowed to halt military
operations against the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   In Bosnia, Defense Secretary William Perry visited U.S. troops
who were part of the NATO peacekeeping force. There was talk of
capturing the Serb leaders indicted by an international tribunal as
war criminals, Gen. Ratko Mladic and Radovan Karadzic, whose
continued freedom was an embarrassment to the administration. It
never happened.
</P>
<P>
   At home, Dole had clinched the Republican presidential
nomination earlier in the month and was assembling a team of
economic advisers. Behind the scenes, the president's political
consultant Dick Morris _ who would be brought down by his own
sexual scandal _ sharpened the Clinton advertising campaign to
focus on Dole. But the expensive advertisements, paid for with
so-called soft money, would later lead to calls for an
investigation into Democratic fund raising.
</P>
<P>
   Things had not been going well in recent weeks for Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   More than a month earlier, on Feb. 19, President's Day, Clinton
telephoned her at her Watergate apartment, Ms. Lewinsky testified,
and she could tell from the tone of his voice that something was
wrong. She asked to see him, but he said he did not know how long
he would be at the office that day.
</P>
<P>
   Worried, she hurried to the White House, the only time she had
gone uninvited to the Oval Office, she said. There, the president
told her he no longer felt right about their relationship and he
had to put a stop to it. She could visit, he said, but only as a
friend. He hugged her, according to the report, but would not kiss
her.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ms. Lewinsky said, in the following days ``there
continued to be this sort of flirtation.'' Clinton called her
apartment, the report said, expressing regret that she had left the
White House early, which she thought ``sort of implied to me that
he was interested in starting up again.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, March 29, while Mrs. Clinton was in Greece, Ms.
Lewinsky ran into the president wearing the first necktie she had
given him. She asked him where he had gotten it. ``Some girl with
style gave it to me,'' she remembered he replied.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested she might want to casually join a group seeing a
movie at the White House theater, but she said she did not want
people to think she was hanging around the West Wing uninvited. She
said that she asked if they could arrange a rendezvous over the
weekend, and that he said he would try.
</P>
<P>
   They did meet that Sunday, March 31, while Mrs. Clinton was
still away. ``According to Ms. Lewinsky, the president telephoned
her at her desk and suggested she come to the Oval Office on the
pretext of delivering papers to him,'' the report said. ``She went
to the Oval Office and was admitted by a plainclothes Secret
Service agent. In her folder was a gift for the president, a Hugo
Boss necktie.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the hallway by the study, the president and Ms. Lewinsky
kissed,'' the report went on, and had a sexual encounter. After
they were finished, the report said, ``Ms. Lewinsky left the Oval
Office and walked through the Rose Garden.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton returned from her trip that evening.
</P>
<P>
   APRIL 7, 1996
</P>
<P>
   It was a bone-chilling Easter Sunday, the exhausting conclusion
of one of the most emotional weeks of the Clinton presidency. Four
days earlier, a military plane carrying Commerce Secretary Ron
Brown and 34 others had slammed into a mountainside near Dubrovnik,
Croatia, killing everyone on board.
</P>
<P>
   And so it had been a week of personal mourning, a black stretch
Clinton spoke of as ``this interminable week.'' Brown had been a
good friend of the president, and in the days following the
tragedy, Clinton postponed or canceled almost all of his scheduled
events to devote himself to propping up the emotions of a grieving
White House and comforting the families and friends of the victims.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, though, he did go ahead and visit another somber
destination, traveling to Oklahoma City in advance of the one-year
anniversary of the April 19 bombing of the federal building.
</P>
<P>
   There were other world events to preoccupy the president.
Fighting between rebels and government soldiers was continuing in
the capital of Liberia, and North Korean troops had entered a
buffer zone with South Korea for the third day.
</P>
<P>
   But the president found it hard to focus on much other than the
deaths on the Croatian cliff. He had to blot tears from his eyes on
Saturday, as he watched the coffins bearing the bodies arriving at
Dover Air Force Base in Delaware. ``We were all holding up pretty
well until they started taking the coffins off the plane,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But now it was Easter, and as was the Clinton family custom, the
president, accompanied by his wife and Chelsea, attended the 11
a.m. service at the Foundry Methodist Church, brightly decorated
with lilies, azaleas and balloons.
</P>
<P>
   The president wore a dark suit. Mrs. Clinton chose a white coat
and black hat graced with a white band and pink flower. Chelsea was
dressed in a navy skirt and blazer. Secret Service agents
interrupted the Easter egg hunt on the church lawn so the first
family could enter.
</P>
<P>
   Wogaman, the church's senior minister, praised Brown and the
``practical goodness'' of those who accompanied him on his trip.
``Easter is God's reply to those in heartsick sorrow,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wogaman also singled out Adam Darling, a 29-year-old
confidential assistant at the Commerce Department, who died in the
crash and was a member of the church.
</P>
<P>
   During Clinton's presidential campaign, Darling had endeared
himself to Clinton by offering to ride a bicycle across the country
in support of the candidate. Darling's parents attended the
service, and they requested that his favorite hymn, ``This Is My
Song,'' be sung. It begins: ``This is my song, O God of all the
nations, a song of peace for lands afar and mine.''
</P>
<P>
   The sermon was about resurrection. During it, Wogaman
complimented the president for having ``ministered so well for our
land.''
</P>
<P>
   As the congregation left the church, shafts of sun finally broke
through the clouds. On the way back to the White House, the
Clintons stopped and shared a quiet Sunday brunch at the Four
Seasons Hotel in Georgetown.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spent the balance of the afternoon, from 2:21 to 7:48,
in the Oval Office. At one point, the Starr report said, he called
Ms. Lewinsky at her apartment.
</P>
<P>
   According to her grand jury testimony, they spoke of the death
of Brown, and then she told him of a fresh personal trauma of her
own. On the previous Friday, she had been advised by Timothy
Keating, staff director for legislative affairs, that she was being
transferred from her White House job and moved to the Pentagon
because she was ``too sexy'' to be working in the East Wing.
</P>
<P>
   A number of White House aides had become increasingly
uncomfortable about how much time she was spending in the vicinity
of the Oval Office, particularly as the campaign heated up. Ms.
Lewinsky said she later learned from the president that Evelyn
Lieberman, the deputy chief of staff, thought Ms. Lewinsky was
paying too much attention to the president and ``everyone needed to
be careful before the election.''
</P>
<P>
   When she learned she was being transferred, Ms. Lewinsky said,
she was crushed and felt it was because of her relationship with
the president.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton seemed disturbed by the news, the report said. Ms.
Lewinsky was sobbing as she related the details to him. Then she
asked if she could come see him. He agreed.
</P>
<P>
   At 4:56 p.m., according to White House logs, Ms. Lewinsky
arrived at the White House carrying a manila folder and, under the
pretext of delivering documents to the president, was admitted to
the Oval Office. She met with the president in his private study,
where they spoke further about her expulsion from the White House
staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do they have to take you away from me?'' she testified
that he asked her. According to her testimony, he looked at her and
said, ``I promise you if I win in November I'll bring you back like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   She said in her testimony that he told her he would find out why
she was transferred, and he said that she could have whatever job
she desired after the election.
</P>
<P>
   Then, according to the Starr report, she began a sexual
encounter with him in the hallway between the private study and the
Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   Someone in the Oval Office called out that the president had a
phone call, the report went on. A White House operator had put the
call through to the Oval Office, the report said, but when no one
picked it up, a Secret Service agent was dispatched to locate the
president.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, he knocked on the door to the Oval
Office, got no answer and then entered. Seeing the door to the
study ajar, the report said, he called out, ``Mr. President.''
Getting no answer, he called out again louder. The agent heard
someone say ``Huh?'' from the study and then, after the agent said
that there was a call for the president, Clinton replied that he
would take it.
</P>
<P>
   The report said Clinton picked up the call in the study,
directing Ms. Lewinsky to continue her sexual actions with him
while he spoke on the phone. According to White House records cited
in the report, the call lasted nine minutes and was from Morris,
the political consultant.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes after the president hung up, the report said,
there was a second interruption. The report quoted Ms. Lewinsky as
testifying: ``Harold Ickes has a very distinct voice and ... I
heard him holler, `Mr. President,' and the president looked at me
and I looked at him and he jetted out into the Oval Office and I
panicked.'' She retreated in the other direction, leaving through
the dining room. It was nearly 5:30.
</P>
<P>
   Two minutes after Ms. Lewinsky left, the report said, Clinton
called Ms. Lieberman, though it is unclear whether he reached her.
</P>
<P>
   That evening, the report said, Clinton telephoned Ms. Lewinsky
at home and asked her why she had fled so hastily. He seemed upset
that she had left.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   FEB. 28, 1997
</P>
<P>
   There were big doings for Chelsea in the works. Yesterday, she
had turned 17. To mark the moment, Mr. and Mrs. Clinton had given a
dinner for her and 10 of her friends at the Bombay Club, just a
block's walk from the White House. There was chocolate cheesecake
and a rendition of ``Happy Birthday'' by the pianist, with the
whole restaurant singing along.
</P>
<P>
   While the president and the first lady took the presidential
limousine back, Chelsea insisted on riding in the van with her
giggling friends. But that was just the prelude. The Clintons were
leaving for New York tomorrow to take their daughter to see some
Broadway plays, something she was very much looking forward to.
</P>
<P>
   Before they could set out, though, the president spent a
workaday Friday attending to drug policy and cigarette sales and
Midwestern winter storms. His major announcement was to certify
Mexico as a full ally in the war against illegal drugs, though only
after the Mexican government agreed to commitments demanded by U.S.
law enforcement agencies. For the second year, Clinton did not
certify Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   There was other international and domestic news for him to
ponder. The FBI was frustrated that the Saudis were not doing more
to investigate a truck bombing that had killed 19 American airmen.
The Democratic Party, in one more development in the protracted
campaign finance drama, said it would be returning $1.5 million
more in contributions that it now felt may have been illegal or
improper.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before 11 a.m., Clinton appeared in the Roosevelt Room
and spoke about an initiative to toughen the rules on cigarette
sales to children. Among the new rules was a requirement that
anyone under 21 who bought a tobacco product was to show a photo ID
so that store clerks no longer had to guess the age of customers.
</P>
<P>
   On the legislative front, Clinton signed into law H.J. Res. 36,
which released money for international population assistance
programs. He gave out a statement celebrating the third anniversary
of the ``Brady Act,'' which provided for a waiting period before
someone could buy a handgun, calling the law ``one of the most
effective public safety measures ever.''
</P>
<P>
   In the course of the day, the president announced plans for
several appointments, including his nomination of Joel Klein as
assistant attorney general in the antitrust division of the
Department of Justice.
</P>
<P>
   He declared a major disaster in South Dakota, which had been
pummeled by a severe winter storm in November, and ordered federal
aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts.
</P>
<P>
   He also freed $250 million for a program to teach Americans
about the harmful psychological and physical effects of sex before
marriage. The program was to stress that abstinence from
extramarital sex was the expected standard of the country.
</P>
<P>
   It had been almost 11 months since the president had had
physical contact with Ms. Lewinsky. Her expulsion to the Pentagon
had succeeded in separating them. The only times she encountered
him were at group events. She had seen him at a reception for the
Saxophone Club, a political organization, and went with her family
to one of the tapings of the president's weekly radio addresses.
</P>
<P>
   She got into the president's 50th birthday party at Radio City
Music Hall in New York, as well as a cocktail party for major
donors to the Democratic Party. She testified that she saw him at a
fund-raiser for Senate Democrats. Noticing that he was wearing a
necktie she had given him, she approached him at the event and told
him, ``Hey, handsome, I like your tie.'' She testified that he
called her later that night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was insecure about the relationship at times and thought
that he would come to forget me easily,'' the Starr report said Ms.
Lewinsky testified. ``Usually when I'd see him, it would kind of
prompt him to call me. So I made an effort. I would go early and
stand in the front so I could see him.''
</P>
<P>
   The report said the two continued to talk with some regularity
by phone, especially in the months after she began her job at the
Pentagon. During the fall '96 campaign, the report said, the
president occasionally called while on the road without Mrs.
Clinton. At least seven of those conversations, the report said,
were sexually explicit. But Ms. Lewinsky complained that she had
not seen him privately and, according to her testimony, he told
her, ``Every day can't be sunshine.''
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 14, 1997, Ms. Lewinsky placed a Valentine's Day ad in
The Washington Post intended as a love message to the president. It
was addressed to ``Handsome.''
</P>
<P>
   At 6:29 p.m. on this Friday, Clinton went to the Roosevelt Room
and taped his weekly radio address to the nation. Among those who
attended the taping was Ms. Lewinsky. According to her testimony,
Clinton had extended an invitation to her through Betty Currie, his
personal secretary.
</P>
<P>
   In the address, which was broadcast the next morning, Clinton
spoke of the need to prevent drugs from ruining children's lives.
``First, we must fight drugs before they reach our borders and keep
them out of America,'' he said, and he explained his decision that
day to enlist Mexico in the battle.
</P>
<P>
   At the session, Ms. Lewinsky had her picture taken with the
president. She was nervous, the report said she testified, for she
had not been alone with him since her days working at the White
House. She wore a navy blue dress that she had bought at the Gap.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, Clinton told her to see Mrs. Currie
after the photo was taken, since he had something to give her.
Clinton, Ms. Lewinsky and Mrs. Currie together went into the back
office. Stephen Goodin, an aide to the president, had told Clinton
and Mrs. Currie that he did not want him alone with Ms. Lewinsky,
which was why Mrs. Currie chaperoned them, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Currie, however, said, ``I'll be right back,'' and went on
to the back dining room where, she testified, she waited for 15 to
20 minutes while the president and Ms. Lewinsky were alone in the
study. As belated Christmas presents, Clinton gave Ms. Lewinsky a
hat pin and an edition of Walt Whitman's ``Leaves of Grass.'' He
told her he had seen her Valentine's Day message.
</P>
<P>
   In the hallway near a bathroom, Ms. Lewinsky testified, she
engaged in a sexual encounter with Clinton. He heard something and
they retreated into the bathroom, but no one disturbed them.
According to White House logs cited in the report, Ms. Lewinsky
left the White House at 7:07 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The next time she got out her navy blue Gap dress, according to
the report, she noticed stains near one hip and on the front of the
dress. After seeing the president, she had gone out to dinner. She
thought the stains might be spinach dip. FBI tests, the report
said, later revealed them to be the semen of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   MARCH 29, 1997
</P>
<P>
   It was a lethargic Saturday. The White House was quiet, and the
president was in something of a funk. He had been forced into a
state of unwanted inactivity. It had been only two weeks since
Clinton had tripped on the stairs of the Florida home of the golf
champion Greg Norman and injured his knee, negating the president's
appearance in a member-guest tournament with Norman.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton had gone ahead with a Helsinki summit meeting
with President Boris Yeltsin of Russia a week earlier, at which he
had to be lowered from a catering truck in a wheelchair, his public
schedule had otherwise been sharply curtailed. At most, he attended
one or two brief events a day. Today he had none.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Easter was at hand, and tomorrow the president would be
presiding over the annual Easter Egg Roll on the South Lawn of the
White House. There was a need to prepare for an Oval Office meeting
on Tuesday with King Hussein of Jordan. A whole year had passed
since the death of Ron Brown, and there would be a memorial service
on Thursday that the president would attend.
</P>
<P>
   On sleepy days like this, Clinton usually changed into his
jogging shorts and took to the roadways or, better yet, tuned up a
golf game grown rusty over the winter. Instead, because he was on
crutches, he was reduced to tasting spring by opening the door of
his study or relaxing on the Truman balcony overlooking the Rose
Garden.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, he was home alone. Mrs. Clinton and Chelsea were
on the last leg of a six-nation trip to Africa. On this final day,
they were to tour a women's skills center in Asmara, take in a
tree-planting ceremony and pay a courtesy visit to Isayas Afewerki,
the president of Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton put on a white, gauzy cotton dress known as a tilfi
and danced merrily with the leader of Africa's newest democracy.
She was scheduled to return to Washington at 7 the next morning, in
plenty of time to attend the Easter Egg Roll with her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Even the vice president was away, on a diplomatic mission in
Asia. And so Clinton was reading, watching basketball and growing
restless.
</P>
<P>
   In his Easter radio address, broadcast at 10:06 in the morning,
Clinton concentrated on the promise of spring, though there was
still too much of a winter snap in the Washington air. ``Spring is
a season of renewal, not just of the world around us but of the
ideals inside us, those that bind us together as people,'' Clinton
said in the address. ``Millions of families will come together to
celebrate Easter this weekend and Passover in the coming weeks, to
reaffirm their faith in God and their commitment to our sacred
values.''
</P>
<P>
   He went on to speak of the need to overcome ``the divide of
race.'' He spoke of a 13-year-old Chicago boy who the previous week
had been riding his bike home from a basketball game and was
attacked and nearly beaten to death. The boy was black and his
accused attackers were white. Clinton finished by saying: ``The
holidays of this season teach us that hope can spring forth from
the darkest of times. Those of us who are Christians celebrate a
risen God who died a painful, very human death to redeem the souls
of all humanity without regard to race or station.''
</P>
<P>
   Early in the afternoon, Clinton repaired to the Oval Office. At
one point, the Starr report said, he called Ms. Lewinsky and
invited her over. He said he had something important to tell her.
</P>
<P>
   A little past 2, Ms. Lewinsky showed up. Mrs. Currie greeted her
and took her to the president's study to await Clinton. He hobbled
in.
</P>
<P>
   The president talked at length to Ms. Lewinsky about his
concerns that others might learn of their rendezvous, the Starr
report said. Without specifically identifying it, he told her that
he feared that a foreign embassy was tapping his telephones.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, he recommended cover stories if they
were found out, suggesting that she insist that they were only
friends. Should anyone have tapes of intimate phone conversations,
well, then she should say they knew that someone was eavesdropping
on the calls and thus they simply feigned the exchanges, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
   Then he kissed her and they had a sexual encounter, she said,
although Clinton later implicitly denied ``inappropriate'' contact
with her that day.
</P>
<P>
   She left at 3:16 p.m. A few minutes later, Clinton left his
office as well. This was, the Starr report says, Monica Lewinsky's
10th and final sexual act with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   EPILOGUE
</P>
<P>
   In the nine months after the last of the White House sexual
trysts, the Starr report says, the relationship between Clinton and
Ms. Lewinsky crumbled inexorably under the president's fear of
exposure and Ms. Lewinsky's growing frustrations at being shut out
of his life.
</P>
<P>
   They met several more times, and had numerous telephone
conversations. They also exchanged small gifts and expressions of
endearment. But the Starr report details a postsexual deterioration
that spills from argument and recrimination to growing suspicions
and finally mutual distrust and even threats by Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the alternating periods of anger and appeasement, there
were hopeless musings about a possible future together. Letters and
notes were exchanged, and then destroyed in an effort to get rid of
evidence of their affair. Most of their gifts were retrieved.
</P>
<P>
   She had been banished to the Pentagon, but the president
promised to bring her back to the White House, and later to get her
a job in New York, perhaps at the United Nations. He enlisted the
help of aides and friends, including Vernon Jordan, his longtime
friend.
</P>
<P>
   But none of it worked out, and she harangued him about these
failures and her exclusion from his life. In an Oval Office meeting
on July 4, 1997, the report said, Clinton reprimanded her for a
letter in which she had obliquely threatened to disclose their
relationship. ``It's illegal to threaten the president of the
United States,'' he told her.
</P>
<P>
   The president showed increasing fear as the arm's-length
relationship dragged on, and it expressed itself in his harsher
tones to her. In a face-to-face argument on Dec. 6., Ms. Lewinsky
recalled, he told her he had ``never been treated as poorly by
anyone else as I had treated him.''
</P>
<P>
   When the story of their relationship finally broke on Jan. 21,
the president, in meetings with aides, denied he had ever been
alone with Ms. Lewinsky. He told Sidney Blumenthal, a White House
communications adviser, that she ``came on to me and made a sexual
demand on me,'' and that when he rebuffed her, she had threatened
to say they had had an affair.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal later testified that the president had spoken like a
trapped man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like a character in a novel,'' he quoted Clinton as
saying. ``I feel like somebody who is surrounded by an oppressive
force that is creating a lie about me and I can't get the truth
out. I feel like the character in the novel `Darkness at Noon.'''
</P>
<P>
   The protagonist in Arthur Koestler's 1941 novel was a man caught
up in the Moscow purges and political trials of the 1930s.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Beneath the public vitriol at the White House about
Kenneth Starr's ``hit-and-run smear campaign,'' President Clinton's
supporters and advisers are moving toward a consensus that Congress
will accept nothing less than a censure of the president.
</P>
<P>
   Few advisers to Clinton say they think he can escape the
Lewinsky scandal without some sort of punishment. They argue that
censure might be the most politically palatable course because it
would satisfy the competing demands of Americans who, judging by
polls conducted this weekend, think Clinton should be rebuked but
also want the nation to move beyond the scandal. But the advisers'
fundamental interest in this option is that it would spare the
president from impeachment proceedings that could force him from
office.
</P>
<P>
   But there are no signs that censure holds any appeal to
Republicans _ now.
</P>
<P>
   In the short term, an unresolved scandal appears to be an asset
for November's elections. They see no reason to hurry, especially
with public reaction still forming and 37 boxes of evidence still
sealed.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the uncertainty is that the House Judiciary Committee,
which would take up an impeachment inquiry, is not known for
compromise. It is perhaps the most polarized committee in the
House, and it lacks a core of moderates that helped the panel
function smoothly during the Watergate hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Still, given that in this scandal the political dynamics are
often confounding and always shifting, Republicans concede that an
accommodation over a punishment short of impeachment is possible in
the longer term. That could happen if Republicans feel intense
pressure from their constituents that the country must move beyond
the Lewinsky matter, or if Democrats successfully frame the drive
for impeachment as a partisan witch hunt.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, Democrats do not see any easy way out, and
Republicans are enjoying their discomfort as they navigate between
voters who think the Lewinsky scandal is overblown and those who
are appalled by Clinton's conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., who is a member of the
Congressional Black Caucus, said ``censure is a possibility.'' He
explained: ``My constituents are in a bind. They hate the
president's conduct, but they love him.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are in no hurry. ``It's not our problem, and the
Republicans shouldn't feel a big need to settle this,'' said Scott
Reed, a former executive director of the Republican Party who ran
Bob Dole's unsuccessful campaign against Clinton in 1996. ``The
climate is great in the House races, the Senate races and most of
the governors races. For them, censure is the easy way out.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason Republicans are reluctant to entertain the censure
idea is they say they are not about to prematurely halt an
impeachment inquiry before the public has a chance to fully digest
Starr's report _ and given the possibility of new revelations
coming from the independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ``To make some quick, interim judgment would short-circuit the
process,'' said Rep. Michael Forbes, R-N.Y. ``That doesn't seem to
be an option on table.''
</P>
<P>
   A well-connected lobbyist with extensive contacts on Capitol
Hill and in the White House, said, ``People on the Hill are just
deathly afraid of giving him a break on censure and then finding
out something else.'' The lobbyist, speaking on the condition of
anonymity, also said there was some nervousness in the White House
as well about censure because ``no one is sure the president would
go for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all the chatter among Democrats about censure, Sen.
Trent Lott, R-Miss., turned up the pressure by suggesting Sunday
that the president consider resigning. But beneath the bravado,
Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who is chairman of the Judiciary
Committee, Sunday opened the door to something short of impeachment
or resignation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no doubt there will be a sanction, the question is
what,'' Hatch said. ``And it could go all the way down from
impeachment to censure, condemnation, rebuke or whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest polls show that the censure option is popular among
Americans but also that people have also grown weary of the
scandal. Impeachment is a drawn-out process that calls for the
House to hold hearings and then vote on impeachment; the next step
would be a trial on the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   In a CBS News Poll conducted Saturday night, 56 percent of
Americans said Congress should censure Clinton. On another
question, about what should happen now, the poll found that 26
percent said Clinton should resign, 10 percent said Congress should
begin impeachment proceedings, and 57 percent said the matter
should be dropped. The nationwide survey of 680 adults has a margin
of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David Skaggs, D-Colo., said he was open to the idea of a
censure and he offered two reasons why Republicans might be
amenable.
</P>
<P>
   ``For those Republicans who view this soberly, not just partisan
angle-playing, do the offenses in the Starr report really reach the
level of gravity that we use the Constitutional equivalent of an
atomic device to get at?'' Skaggs asked. He also argued that
Republicans want Clinton to serve out his term because ``most
Republicans don't wish to give Al Gore a head start on the year
2000'' if he were to be elevated to the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans may also find that they can seize on the censure
option to burnish their party's image. If, in the end, Republicans
overwhelmingly favor impeachment but few Democrats are willing to
go along with them, Republicans could choose to broker a compromise
_ some might call it a political plea bargain _ rather than coming
across as bitter and partisan.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their increasing talk of censure _ a punishment meted
only to one president, Andrew Jackson, more than a century ago _
several Democrats said it was impossible to predict whether, or
how, a deal could be reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conventional wisdom is racing there at a very fast
speed,'' a senior White House official, speaking on the condition
of anonymity, said of censure. ``I just don't know how the whole
censure thing is going to play out. It's very uncharted waters.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, now that the Lewinsky matter is in the hands of
Congress, it is far from clear that Clinton and his advisers can
wield much influence, even among Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Another close aide to the president put it this way: ``Our clout
right now is rather limited on this. Wouldn't you say?'' &QL;

SOSA HITS HIS 62ND HOME RUN 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By BILL DEDMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Roger Maris' children weren't in the stands Sunday at
Wrigley Field. The commissioner couldn't make it. The official
National League baseballs bore no infrared markings. And the only
nation with a live broadcast was the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Someone forgot to tell Sammy Sosa that the home run race was
over.
</P>
<P>
   With his 61st and 62nd home runs on the same afternoon, the
Dominican slugger for the Chicago Cubs moved even with Mark McGwire
of St. Louis, with the Cardinals scheduled to play later in
Houston. For the moment, the tortoise had caught the hare.
</P>
<P>
   So the 37-year-old record for most home runs in a single season
has been passed twice in less than a week. The name next to the new
mark in baseball's record book will be decided over the next two
weeks by the friendly competitors, McGwire and Sosa. One, a
college-educated, white son of a dentist from California, has had
all the attention. The other, an uneducated, black man whose first
baseball glove was made from a milk carton in San Pedro de Macoris,
now has all the momentum.
</P>
<P>
   After Sosa's record-tying blast, it took three curtain calls to
sate the overflow crowd of 40,846, the largest this year at
Wrigley. The crowd roared for five minutes until the game
continued, and buzzed for an hour after with chants of ``Sammy!
Sammy!''
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Sosa conducted interviews in two languages and
received congratulatory telephone calls from Randy Maris, one of
Roger's sons, and from Bud Selig, the commissioner of baseball and
an owner of the Brewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unbelievable,'' Sosa said graciously in words that echoed
McGwire after he hit his 62nd home run last Tuesday. ``I have to
say what I did is for the people of Chicago, for America, for my
mother, for my wife, my kids and the people I have around me.'' He
went on to name even the manager of the opposing team.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa would have had another chance for a home run Sunday, if the
veteran Mark Grace hadn't hit a home run to beat the Milwaukee
Brewers in the 10th inning, 11-10. Sosa, who would have batted
next, was so happy he hugged the umpire. ``I'm sorry that I hit
that home run so Sammy couldn't come up to the plate,'' Grace said.
</P>
<P>
   For Chicago baseball fans, the significant event of the day was
when the Cubs raised the ``W'' flag above the scoreboard for a
victory. Chicago stayed ahead of the New York Mets by one game in
the competition for the last spot in the National League playoffs.
The Mets also won a close one, 1-0, in Montreal. The Cubs haven't
played a post-season game since 1989.
</P>
<P>
   When asked how he felt about the home runs, Sosa said, ``I have
a good feeling we're going to make it to the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   After McGwire broke the record on Tuesday, Sosa might have begun
trying too hard to hit home runs. He went five days without coming
close to a homer. By then, McGwire was the toast of the world with
62, and Sosa remained four back at 58, the race conceded even by
Sosa, who continued to declare, ``Mark is the man.''
</P>
<P>
   The foul pole oracles at Wrigley Field disagree on Sosa's
patience.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Williams, the Hall of Famer and Cubs coach, whose No. 26
hangs from the right field pole at Wrigley Field, said, ``You could
see it a few times in Pittsburgh and St. Louis: overswinging a bit.
All the hooplah about the home runs has to get in your way.''
</P>
<P>
   Ernie Banks, the Hall of Famer whose No. 14 hangs from the left
field pole, gently disagreed. ``He's not pressing. He's handled it
extremely well.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa showed grace on Saturday and Sunday by muting his
celebration. While each of his home runs pulled his team closer,
the Cubs still trailed. After he hit No. 60 on Saturday, he didn't
even smile. Sosa just waved his cap to the crowd and took his seat.
But when Orlando Merced hit the game winning home run in the ninth,
Sosa was the first one to home plate. Sunday he helped carry Grace
off the field.
</P>
<P>
   Both of Sosa's home runs Sunday sailed over the ivy-covered wall
in left field, over the fence, and over Waveland Avenue beyond.
After each impact, Sosa made his trademark leap of exulation and
clenched his fists. No member of the Milwaukee Brewers offered a
pat on the back or applauded, as the Cubs had done for McGwire when
he broke the record in St. Louis on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Both of Sosa's home runs were estimated at 480 feet. The first,
a two-run blast at the expense a rookie pitcher, Bronswell Patrick,
put the Cubs ahead 8-3 in the fifth inning. The second, against
veteran Eric Plunk in the ninth inning, started a rally in which
the Cubs tied the game.
</P>
<P>
   The first ball was misplayed by a mob that knocked over a man in
a wheelchair, then was fielded on the rebound by John W. Witt, an
unemployed former employee of the Chicago National League Ball Club
Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Witt was sitting in a van under the Dominican flag at the corner
of Waveland and Kenmore avenues when fortune came his way. A
divorced 29-year-old from Dixon, Ill., he said he faced a hard
choice: give the ball to Sosa or sell it. The profit might help him
take care of his two young children. Friends hustled him and the
ball back into a van for safe-keeping, as fans scrambled for his
autograph.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll talk to Sammy about it,'' said Witt. Last year he quit
his job as clubhouse manager for the Rockford Cubbies, the Cubs'
single-A team.
</P>
<P>
   The second home run bounced down an alley. Two fans said they
had it but it was grabbed by someone who ran off. Police hustled
away a man who had a baseball, but it was unclear how he'd be able
to authenticate his fortune. Major League Baseball had not marked
these game balls, at was done when McGwire reached 60.
</P>
<P>
   Could Sosa, who is the leading candidate for most valuable
player in the league, end up with more jonrones than McGwire? After
Sunday, Sosa has 12 games remaining, McGwire 13. Both sluggers will
face the weak-pitching Brewers and the powerful Houston Astros.
Sosa also draws the first-place Padres and the lowly Cincinnati
Reds, while McGwire plays two poor teams, the Pittsburgh Pirates
and Montreal Expos.

RAFTER KEEPS CROWN WITH DASH AND SPIRIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By ROBIN FINN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ His signature sunscreen mask had already melted away,
and his signature ponytail was flying at half-mast, but Patrick
Rafter, who put his signature on the U.S. Open's trophy for the
second consecutive year Sunday, was simply flying high.
</P>
<P>
   Dashing toward the net on a wing and a prayer, just the way he
had done since he was 9 and used his sprints to beat eight siblings
to the dinner table, the Australian acrobat completed a spirited
and successful defense of his 1997 Open title at the National
Tennis Center.
</P>
<P>
   Pestered only occasionally by the phalanx of jetliners that
mysteriously returned to the shared airspace above Arthur Ashe
Stadium and LaGuardia Airport one match ahead of schedule, the
third-seeded Rafter committed just five unforced errors during the
6-3, 3-6, 6-2, 6-0 pasting of his fellow Australian, Mark
Philippoussis, that secured him a second career Grand Slam crown.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go into a Grand Slam on adrenaline,'' said the 25-year-old
Rafter. ``Last year was more nerve-racking; nerves never really
played an issue in today's match.''
</P>
<P>
   As the contest wore on for 2 hours and 4 minutes, Philippoussis,
after barreling off to a 5-2 lead in the second set and shaking off
three double faults in the game that leveled the match, began to
doubt his ability to dethrone Rafter. ``Psychologically he never
recovered,'' Rafter said of the final set rout that transpired
after Philippoussis surrendered the third set on a service break.
</P>
<P>
   In that pivotal set, where the 6-foot-4-inch Philippoussis felt
he had been turned into such a big target that he ultimately turned
tail, Rafter made no unforced mistakes at all. The challenger
visibly buckled in the sixth game, after Rafter's frenzied
corner-to-corner scramble ended with a dash toward the net and
retrieval of a drop shot for a break point he converted for a 4-2
edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to hand it to Pat,'' said the loser, who had barely
spoken to Rafter since their springtime rift over Philippoussis'
decision to skip the Davis Cup. ``Five unforced errors in the whole
match, it's extremely impressive. Right now he's playing like the
best player in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The last man to etch his name on back-to-back U.S. Open titles
was Pete Sampras, the four-time champion Rafter ousted in five sets
in the semifinals. The top-seeded Sampras, who last repeated here
as champion in 1996, had hoped to capture a 12th career Grand Slam
at this Open, tying him with the record owned by Australia's Roy
Emerson, but he came up lame and went home empty-handed.
</P>
<P>
   Not so Rafter, who again took home a Grand Slam title at the
expense of an unseeded challenger and now moves up a spot to No. 2
in the rankings. Rafter's victim in the first all-Australian U.S.
Open finale since Ken Rosewall's 1970 downing of Rafter's mentor,
Tony Roche, wore a familiar face: Philippoussis, a first-time Grand
Slam finalist who had never before passed a Grand Slam quarterfinal
and who has been a doubles partner, intramural arch-rival, and
sporadic alter-ego to Rafter.
</P>
<P>
   Rafter went the conventional Australian route and drew counsel
from icons ranging from Roche to Rod Laver to John Newcombe. But
Philippoussis took a maverick course and took orders from
outsiders, including his father, Nick, who drove a Melbourne cab to
support his son's tennis habit, and Nick Bollettieri, whose Florida
academy is Philippoussis' current home away from home.
</P>
<P>
   Rafter, who hadn't won any of his eight titles until he made his
breakthrough run at the 1997 Open, and Philippoussis, a
late-bloomer with just one title under his belt, didn't receive
their 1998 wake-up calls until the year was half over.
</P>
<P>
   A downcast Rafter was buoyed by some unsolicited motivational
advice from Newcombe just before Wimbledon and went on to win two
hardcourts titles this summer, the first man since Ivan Lendl in
1987 to win a pair of summer titles plus the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   An even more discouraged Philippoussis, who made noise about
temporary retirement after a disappointing Wimbledon tune-up at
Queens, added Pat Cash to his coaching entourage and came into the
Open talking about being a title contender.
</P>
<P>
   Rafter's ability to survive the full seven rounds was all the
more remarkable for the treacherous start he made here. He was down
two-sets-to-none against Morocco's Hicham Arazi and in serious
danger of becoming the first Open champion to receive a first-round
dethroning.
</P>
<P>
   But he rallied, and besides beating Sampras for the second time
in a month, Rafter also defused the ever-dangerous Goran Ivanisevic
in the fourth round. It all proved ample preparation for facing the
service grenades regularly supplied by Philippoussis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going in with any special voodoo treatments or
chanting or anything,'' Rafter had said of his approach to warding
off his opponent's larger-than-life serves, and it worked.
Philippoussis fired just five aces, one fewer than the winner, and
was so anxious about evading Rafter's well-placed returns that he
hurried into 13 double faults, the last of them at match point.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to Philippoussis, Rafter double-faulted just once,
and he lost his cool just once, when he slammed his racquet to the
court during a difficult hold for 3-2 in the third set.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not quite as euphoric as last year, but it's very
satisfying,'' Rafter said after doing the one thing Sampras had
earlier termed the hardest thing to do in his sport: return to the
scene of a seven-round sweep and successfully defend a Grand Slam
title.
</P>
<P>
   For Philippoussis, Rafter predicted a possible trip to the top
if and when he ``gets his game together.'' For himself, he
predicted a Champagne and beer bash.
</P>
<P>
   ``This,'' he said, ``has been a very special day.''

NEWCOMER FAVORED IN WASHINGTON MAYORAL PRIMARY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By IRVIN MOLOTSKY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For the first time in 20 years, Marion Barry will
not be a candidate or a looming presence on Tuesday when Democratic
voters in the District of Columbia choose their candidate for
mayor.
</P>
<P>
   His name almost never comes up on the campaign trail, probably
because candidates are reluctant to criticize Barry, who remains
popular despite having to interrupt his third term as mayor to
serve six months in jail on a cocaine-possession conviction and to
suffer the embarrassment of seeing Congress take away most of his
authority in his fourth term when the city listed toward
bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Since Democrats hold a 10-to-1 advantage over enrolled
Republicans, their candidate seems a virtual certainty to be
elected mayor in November. That person is expected to be Anthony A.
Williams, a government technocrat who moved to Washington less than
three years ago when he became chief financial officer and helped
lift the city out of its chronic deficits.
</P>
<P>
   Williams holds a substantial lead over the three other main
contenders, whose roles as City Council members seem to be working
to Williams' advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the odd man out,'' said professor Charles Horner of the
Howard University political science department. ``It becomes a
liability, a disability to be on the council. I think most people
view the council as not effective.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever effectiveness the Democratic City Council and the mayor
had was taken from them by a Republican Congress, which created a
Control Board last year to oversee the operation of the city.
</P>
<P>
   The Control Board has effective control over things like the
police department, the schools and public works. Barry and his
colleagues have been left with things like promotion of tourism.
</P>
<P>
   At a candidates' forum at the St. Paul's Episcopal Church parish
meeting house the other night, none of the candidates raised the
issue of Williams' brief residence in the city.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview afterward, Williams said the question had not
been raised because ``this isn't a frequent-flyer program'' in
which candidates get credit for the length of residency. ``I've
made a commitment to the city and I've brought its finances back,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   But in an interview later, Councilman Jack Evans, another
candidate, said he had raised the carpetbagger issue at other
forums.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's a guy who moved here only because he had to,'' Evans
said. ``Can you imagine New York City electing someone who had
lived there only two and a half years?''
</P>
<P>
   But if Williams has a residency problem, Evans has another
hurdle that is even more substantial. He is the only principal
candidate for the Democratic nomination who is white, while the
city's population in the 1990 census was 66 percent black (that
percentage may be lower today).
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because of this, Evans trailed among the four main
candidates in a poll conducted in late August by The Washington
Post.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was favored by 37 percent of those responding, trailed
by Councilman Kevin Chavous with 20 percent, Councilman Harold
Brazil with 8 percent and Evans with 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was playing a rather quixotic role, Evans insisted
that he had a chance to win, and he pointed to cities that had
elected mayors who were not members of the predominant racial
group.
</P>
<P>
   Gary, Ind., is 90 percent black and Jersey City, N.J., is 75
percent black but both have white mayors, he said, while Houston,
with a black population of only 15 percent, has a black mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the results of the Democratic primary, there will be a
white mayoral candidate on the ballot in November, Carol Schwartz,
a Republican member of the City Council. Ms. Schwartz is unopposed
in the Republican primary for mayor.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The single most influential factor in elections here is the
endorsement of The Washington Post, and Williams has it, although
The Post's endorsement was hesitant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our enthusiasm for Mr. Williams is not unqualified,'' the
editorial said. While Williams helped ``pull the city back from the
brink of insolvency three years ago,'' the editorial said, it
faulted him for things like engaging in back-channel dealings with
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   When Barry was in jail, The Post's endorsement of Sharon Pratt
Kelly allowed her to leap to the top of a closely bunched group of
candidates. But her mayoralty was not a success, the city's fiscal
crisis worsened, with the deficit rising to $300 million, and
Barry, not long emerged from jail, was re-elected easily in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Through all his travails _ almost a Shakespearean tragedy of a
rise from civil rights leader to a mayor brought down by drugs,
alcohol, corrupt government and misspent public money _ Barry
remains the most popular politician in Washington.

FOR TOBACCO GROWERS, A CHANGING LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ky.)  (lb) 
 By R.W. APPLE Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAVE CITY, Ky. _ Larry Walden doesn't look or sound very much
like a villain.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday afternoon, he stood in his corrugated steel barn
near here, just down the road from Mammoth Cave, and tried
patiently to explain the economics, the emotions and the politics
of growing tobacco, which he has done for a living for the last 30
years, since he was 12 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Above his head, stalks of ocher-colored tobacco, drying in the
late-summer breeze, hung from laths, sticks to those in the trade.
The air inside was as opulently perfumed as a fine Havana cigar.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may be headed for nowhere,'' Walden said. ``I think the
price supports for tobacco may be finished in a year or two, and if
that happens, these little towns around here will just dry up and
blow away. I don't know what I'd do, but I know there's no other
crop that would bring me as much income.''
</P>
<P>
   Walden is the biggest tobacco grower, he thinks, in Barren
County, which produces more tobacco than any other county in the
state. But he is no tycoon, and neither are many of the other
Kentucky growers, most of whom produce flavor- and nicotine-rich
burley tobacco. The state, second in annual production to North
Carolina, has more tobacco-dependent counties than any other, with
60,000 farmers averaging an income from tobacco of about $12,000 a
year.
</P>
<P>
   A trim, bearded, laconic man in Cat hat and aviator glasses,
Walden clutched a beer, encased in an insulating cylinder called a
``hugger,'' as he talked to a visitor.
</P>
<P>
   He conceded that he himself no longer smoked or chewed tobacco.
His wife, he said, had told him, ``If you stop, it might help your
health.'' But that, he insisted, had nothing to do with his
decision to give up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made up my own mind to quit,'' Walden said rather
defensively, like a man determined to defend his picture of himself
as a rugged individualist.
</P>
<P>
   For all the research projects and all the anti-smoking publicity
in the last decade or so, he said he was still not convinced that
smoking is harmful to health. His father, he said, smokes three or
four packs of cigarettes a day. When his father had open heart
surgery not long ago, in his 70s, the surgeon said that half his
patients smoked and half did not, Walden reported.
</P>
<P>
   Alice Baesler, the Kentucky Department of Agriculture's tobacco
expert, said that most growers, like Walden, had grown up in the
business. Families, she said, ``have existed for this for
generations, with tobacco at the center of their lives, so much so
that in the fall, they are drawn to the fields at harvest time,
whatever and wherever their everyday jobs may be.''
</P>
<P>
   It is undeniably a beautiful crop, with the broad leaves turning
green-gold in the fields before the stalks are cut, mounted six to
a stick and hung in old red barns, many of them covered with wild
morning glories, with loose boards to let the air through.
</P>
<P>
   It is undeniably a profitable crop. Mrs. Baesler, whose husband,
Scotty, a Democrat, represents the Lexington area in the House of
Representatives, said that an acre of tobacco produced a gross
income of about $4,000 in good years, while corn or soybeans
produced no more than $500. ``Nothing else, except marijuana,
brings in the kind of money that tobacco does in Tennessee,
Kentucky and the Carolinas,'' Walden said. ``Flat nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Baesler is running for the Senate this fall against Rep. Jim
Bunning, the Hall of Fame pitcher nominated by the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, everything from green peppers to wheat has been
proposed as a supplemental or replacement crop for tobacco, without
much success. In July, the University of Kentucky's Center for
Business and Economic Research said that cultivating and processing
hemp, a cousin of marijuana that can be used in paper products and
textiles, could produce $17.6 million a year in worker income, less
than tobacco but a lot more than most other products. But growing
hemp remains illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Both Mr. and Mrs. Baesler are loudly critical of President
Clinton's tobacco policies, particularly his first-term proposal to
finance health-care reform with a tobacco tax. Most Kentucky
politicians feel that way. Rep. Ron Lewis, a Republican whose
district includes Larry Walden's farm, attended a 1994 smokers'
rights rally where Hillary Rodham Clinton was burned in effigy. It
was an ``inappropriate'' act, he said, a ``desperate'' bid to draw
attention to a righteous cause.
</P>
<P>
   Walden said he resented Clinton as well as former President
Ronald Reagan, whom he blamed for driving government-supported
prices down so far that only now, 18 years later, were tobacco
revenues returning to their former levels.
</P>
<P>
   But his deepest scorn was reserved for the four big cigarette
companies, which he accused of profiteering and price manipulation.
It is they, Walden said, ``who give the farmer a real licking, year
in and year out.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He will produce 175,000 pounds of tobacco this year, using
government quotas (the acreage the government allows a farmer to
use to grow tobacco and it can be bought, sold or leased) for his
own land as well as the quotas of other landowners who do not grow
tobacco, which he leases.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard, manual work, from the time the seedlings are
transplanted through the summer harvest and until the leaves are
finally stripped from the stalks at a rotating table, after they
have dried in the barns for eight weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes Walden is optimistic. He sees how much revenue tobacco
produces for the government in taxes, and how many sporting events
it supports, and concludes that ``they'll never put the growers out
of business.'' Other times, he thinks the game is up, and he
wonders about expanding his dairy herd.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never occurs to me,'' he said, ``that I'm doing anything
wrong. Nobody forces people to smoke cigarettes. It's their
choice.''

   WASHINGTON _ With the president's lawyers arguing on Sunday that
even possible perjury by Clinton is not sufficient grounds for
impeachment, the country began a painful debate over the future of
his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The 445-page report to Congress by the independent counsel,
Kenneth Starr, was the talk at county fairs, in church pews, on
editorial pages and on television talk shows. And congressmen back
home with their constituents for the weekend, with less than two
months to go before election day, were listening closely.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews around the country, citizens continued to express
revulsion at the president's behavior but also their reluctance to
put the nation through the trauma of presidential resignation or
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington state, Dennis Pappas, a 55-year-old inventory
planner for the Boeing Co., summarized the president's behavior as
``wrong but not impeachable.'' Added his wife, Janice, ``Yes, its
between him and Hillary. I think the rest of us should get on and
get over it.''
</P>
<P>
   But in Poolesville, Md., Alex Viessmann, a retired Navy captain,
declared, ``I want him out of there. Just can't stand the man.''
</P>
<P>
   That conflict was apparent in the early polling. While
two-thirds of Americans believe Clinton does not share their moral
values, an identical number does not think he should resign from
office, according to a CBS News Poll released on Sunday. And while
Clinton's favorability ratings have slipped over the past several
days, he is still considerably more popular than Starr.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, ever sensitive to popular opinion, appeared to
be relying on those public views in intensifying the vigorous
defense of Clinton's actions and continuing the attacks on Starr.
</P>
<P>
   At least 25 newspapers have called for the the president's
resignation, including seven that circulate 250,000 or more papers
on Sundays, while others pondered weightily the historic impact of
the scandal. The president is ``morally unfit to continue in
office,'' declared The Albuquerque Tribune. The Detroit Free Press
argued that by stepping down, Clinton would be surrendering to
Starr and setting a dangerous precedent for future presidents.
</P>
<P>
   In houses of worship of all denominations, the clergy used the
week's events to emphasize the power of redemption and the healing
grace of God.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbis were preparing their congregations for the High Holy
Days; the Roman Catholic liturgy this week highlights the tale of
the Prodigal Son. Clinton skipped church on Sunday morning after
learning that his pastor, the Rev. J. Philip Wogaman of the Foundry
United Methodist Church in Washington, had made forgiveness the
subject of his sermon. Wogaman said in his homily that the Lewinsky
affair might be a blessing ``because it forced him to face up to
things.''
</P>
<P>
   The president did not want to make the congregation
uncomfortable by attending, an aide said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, said that
the evidence is ``overwhelming'' that Clinton lied to a grand jury.
He added that perjury could clearly be grounds to open an
impeachment inquiry. In an interview on the Fox network, Lott said
that Congress almost certainly would proceed with impeachment
hearings.
</P>
<P>
   He expressed hopes that the president ``will weigh very
carefully in his decisions from here on in the impact that all of
this has on his family, and on the presidency, and on the country,
the government, our image overseas. He needs to use judgment, which
he certainly didn't exercise when it comes to, when it came to the
sex matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether such considerations might lead Clinton to
voluntarily step down, Lott said, ``It could. I mean, I guess, you
know, that's a call only he can make.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott returned more forcefully to the theme later in the
interview, saying: ``I think he has got to come to terms with the
seriousness of this matter, and decide what he can do to help all
of us to get through it. That may mean that he needs to consider
the counsel of senior members of his party in the Congress about
whether or not he should resign or not.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House dispatched the top members of the president's
legal defense team to the airwaves on Sunday morning to rebut what
they called Starr's politically-motivated effort to humiliate the
president with a catalogue of titillating detail and a list of
spurious impeachment charges.
</P>
<P>
   In a significant shift in strategy, the president's lawyers said
that even if Clinton did commit perjury in a civil deposition in
January and again before a criminal grand jury in August, that
alone did not form sufficient grounds to begin impeachment
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever the president did or whatever the president said,
whether it was in January or August, there simply is no basis for
removing the president from office,'' said Charles F.C. Ruff, the
White House counsel, in the broadest defense of the president yet
heard.

   TEHRAN, Iran _ Attackers tried to kill a powerful Iranian
official Sunday, adding to an atmosphere of unease at a time of
growing tension between Iran and neighboring Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   The official, Mohsen Rafiqdoust, was reported by the government
press agencies to have been unhurt in the attack, which was carried
out by assailants who opened fire from hills overlooking his
office.
</P>
<P>
   The attempt on his life was the latest in a series of attacks on
prominent Iranians, including the assassination last month of the
former prison director, Assadollah Lajevardi.
</P>
<P>
   By evening, no one had taken responsibility for the attack on
Rafiqdoust, but an Iranian opposition group, the People's
Mujahedeen, has said it carried out the earlier attacks as part of
a campaign against Iran's ruling establishment.
</P>
<P>
   There appeared to be no evidence of any link between the
attempted assassination of Rafiqdoust, who heads a vast
government-affiliated economic foundation, and Iran's increasing
tensions with Afghanistan. Still, the latest attack may well be
cited by some hard-liners here as further reason for Iran to
confront the militant Taliban movement that controls Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Recent violence in Tehran, including a bombing outside a
downtown courthouse, had already prompted dark suggestions that
saboteurs must have been operating from Taliban-controlled
territory along Iran's eastern border. The main focus of Iranian
concern remained firmly fixed on Afghanistan, where the Taliban on
Sunday captured the last major stronghold held by an Iranian-backed
opposition militia.
</P>
<P>
   At least nine Iranian diplomats were killed by Taliban forces
during an earlier Taliban victory a month ago, and Iran feared that
the Taliban victory Sunday, in Bamiyan, might be followed by
similar reprisals, this time against Shiite Muslim civilians. Most
Iranians are Shiite Muslims; the Taliban are Sunni Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban leader, Mullah Mohammad Omar, sought to dispel
concerns by issuing a statement saying civilians would be free to
leave Bamiyan, the official Afghan press agency reported. But
Iranian television reported Sunday night that the city, whose
population of 300,000 includes about 10,000 Shiites, was in ``blood
and fire,'' and that the dead included many women and children.
</P>
<P>
   Since its diplomats first disappeared from the Iranian Consulate
in the Afghan town of Mazar-i-Sharif last month, Iran has deployed
tens of thousands of troops near the border. Since the diplomats
were found dead last week, Tehran has stepped up its threats of
revenge.
</P>
<P>
   Iran has repeated assertions by international human rights
groups that the Taliban may have already killed large numbers of
Shiite civilians in Mazar-i-Sharif, and President Mohammad Khatami
on Sunday explicitly accused the Taliban of having committed war
crimes.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In general, public debate in Iran over what to do about the
Taliban has been divided along familiar lines, even as officials
await an Afghan response to Iranian demands that the Taliban arrest
and hand over those responsible for killing the diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban rejected the demands, with a spokesman saying the
incident was an ``internal affair,'' The Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
   In the newspapers known to reflect their views, supporters of
Khatami have usually counseled restraint, while hard-liners
associated with the more conservative religious establishment have
advocated a military strike. The Tehran Times, which usually
straddles a middle ground, said of the Taliban in an editorial
Sunday: ``It would not be surprising if one day Iran decides to
wipe out these irrational fanatics _ a real stigma on the head of
international community _ from the face of humanity in order to
render a great service to mankind.''
</P>
<P>
   Rafiqdoust, the official who escaped assassination Sunday, is a
leading conservative member of Iran's political establishment.
Appointed to his position by Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei, he heads the Foundation of the Deprived and War Disabled,
which controls most hotels and hundreds of other enterprises. Set
up after the Islamic revolution of 1979, the foundation has assets
estimated in the many billions of dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Joseph Clayton, chief executive of the Frontier Corp., wears his
heart on his bumper.
</P>
<P>
   There, on the license plate of one of his three Cadillacs, is
the clearest expression of Clayton's ambitions for the phone
company he has run for a year: ``FRO 50''
</P>
<P>
   That is bold for an executive whose company's shares, under the
ticker symbol FRO, closed Friday at $25.938 _ a long way from $50 _
on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   But high expectations are a staple these days at Frontier's
headquarters in Rochester, as the company tries to evolve beyond
its roots as a local phone monopoly. Its 1996 acquisition of part
of the national fiber optic network being built by Qwest
Communications International looks like more of a steal every week.
And it is finally delivering something akin to stable earnings
growth.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that Frontier has yet to escape its legacy of
failure. In the 1990s, perhaps no communications carrier has opened
a wider gap between expectation and execution. Its strategic vision
has so often surpassed management's ability to fulfill it that many
industry experts remain unconvinced that Frontier, which changed
its name from Rochester Telephone in 1995, can ever become a
national provider of voice, video and data services.
</P>
<P>
   Clayton, normally an effusive salesman, turns a bit coy when
asked the true significance of ``FRO 50.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just thought it would be a good target,'' he said in a
recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   But the prevailing sentiment in the industry is that Clayton,
the former sales and marketing chief for Thomson Consumer
Electronics, was hired last year to whip Frontier into shape and
sell it. And there may be few Frontier stockholders who would not
leap to tender their shares for $50.
</P>
<P>
   If the stock market stays afloat, the communications industry's
takeover tango seems destined to continue at a healthy pace, and
that is good for Frontier. But with every deal _ especially Bell
Atlantic Corp.'s July decision to acquire the GTE Corp. for $52.9
billion _ the list of potential acquirers gets shorter.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Frontier's evolution from clumsy striver to
turnaround (and takeover) prospect reflects the difficulties faced
by old midsize companies in an industry dominated by national
titans and lean niche operators.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like Southern New England Telecommunications, sell out to
bigger carriers. Some, like Century Telephone Enterprises, focus on
rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald L. Bittner, Frontier's former chairman, who died last
year, spent decades working his way up the ladder at Rochester
Telephone and had a strategic vision for the company. But he was
unable to enforce the discipline needed to pull it off.
</P>
<P>
   In the early and mid-1990s, Frontier, which is not subject to
the complex federal regulations imposed on the regional Bells,
became the most important local phone company to make a big push
into long distance since GTE and United Telephone (which became
Sprint) did so in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Frontier acquired more than half a dozen long-distance carriers,
including ALC Communications, American Sharecom and WCT
Communications. By 1996, it was one of the nation's top 10
long-distance companies.
</P>
<P>
   But Bittner, whose health was failing, did not properly
integrate the executive teams and financial operations of his
acquisitions. The result was a financial meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   Clayton, 48, has made a difference. Until this year, the company
had not matched a quarterly earnings target in at least two years,
according to First Call, a financial research firm. But in each of
this year's first two quarters, it beat Wall Street's expectations
by a penny a share.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Clayton's agenda has been to clean out the management
team. Among those leaving were Kevin J. Bennis, an executive vice
president; Dale M. Gregory, head of corporate development, and
Louis L. Massaro, the chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   To replace Massaro, Clayton hired Rolla Huff, 41, an
up-and-comer in the industry who helped evaluate mergers for the
AT&AMP;T Corp. in the mid-1990s before running AT&AMP;T's wireless
operation in the Midwest. Huff's merger experience will probably
come in handy.
</P>
<P>
   The main reason Frontier is valuable to a bigger company is its
piece of the Qwest network, which will be one of the most advanced
in the world. Bought for $500 million, those fiber optic assets are
now worth billions.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic would have been a natural candidate to acquire
Frontier, with the Rochester operation filling out its New York
territory, but after its deal with GTE, which also owns part of the
Qwest system, it has little reason to buy Frontier's share.
</P>
<P>
   Another Bell, like SBC Communications, could go for Frontier.
But any Bell deal would raise tough regulatory questions because
the Bells are not allowed to offer long-distance service within
their regions, and Frontier sells it all over the country.
</P>
<P>
   People close to Frontier say a foreign carrier could be the most
logical suitor. As British Telecommunications PLC demonstrated with
its attempted takeover of the MCI Communications Corp., foreign
companies can be especially skittish about American acquisitions
diluting earnings. But with a stock that trades at about 23 times
estimated earnings, Frontier is not expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Of the foreign candidates, Cable and Wireless PLC makes perhaps
the most sense. (France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom are still
entangled with Sprint, and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone has not
demonstrated that it is willing to spend big to get into the United
States.) Cable and Wireless is already one of the larger
long-distance carriers in the United States, but it leases its
network capacity. A network of its own could let it cut operating
costs sharply.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Cable and Wireless is about to complete its
acquisition of MCI's Internet business, getting both equipment and
customers. But it still has to lease fiber optic capacity from MCI
to carry Internet data. Frontier's part of the Qwest network would
help solve that problem.
</P>
<P>
   Cable and Wireless' new Internet business could also fit nicely
with Globalcenter, the Web service company run by Douglas T. Hickey
that Frontier acquired this year.
</P>
<P>
   A sticking point in almost any acquisition would be Frontier's
local operations. They generate a lot of cash, but any foreign
carrier interested in Frontier's national network would be a lot
less interested in running (and paying for) a local phone company
in Rochester.
</P>
<P>
   That could require a three-way deal. People close to Frontier
say candidates to acquire Frontier's local operations would include
Bell Atlantic, Citizens and Century.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves one more question: Will Clayton hold out for that
$50?

BULLPEN'S LATEST COLLAPSE COSTS CONE 20TH VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The self-tortured David Cone had sidestepped peril
all day as if playing matador on a freeway. But he could only take
an isolated seat on the Yankee bench and chew the flavor out of a
piece of gum as he left his troubles to someone else Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   As his pitch count swelled, Cone was lifted by Manager Joe Torre
with two outs in the sixth inning, the bases loaded and the Yanks
leading the Blue Jays 3-1 at Yankee Stadium. It was up to the
bullpen to pull Cone out of this collision course and preserve the
opportunity for him to become the first pitcher in the major
leagues to win 20 games this season.
</P>
<P>
   But the unsettling struggles of the Yankee bullpen continued as
a parade of relievers _ Graeme Lloyd, Jeff Nelson and Mike Stanton
_ failed to secure the third out in the inning before the Blue Jays
scored three runs and took a lead they would not relinquish.
Toronto sent the Yankees to their third straight defeat, 5-3.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Torre continues to play it safe as the post-season
approaches, this was the Yankees' 14th defeat in 25 games and a
sign that the pixie dust has worn off this magical season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think after we clinched the division _ and I hate to say
this _ but there was a letdown,'' said Stanton, who gave up the
go-ahead run after Lloyd had allowed a game-tying, two-run single
two batters before him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of who we put on the field, if you don't do what
you have to do, you won't win,'' Stanton said. ``As far as I'm
concerned, and I don't care who gets the loss officially, it was my
loss. Right now, I think this team has to guard against waiting
until the last minute to turn it on.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not as if the Yankees (103-44) have grown bored and
uninterested because they have the luxury of playoff security. Paul
O'Neill let that be known when he let his emotion get the best of
him. He represented the go-ahead run with two outs and two on in
the seventh inning when he was caught looking at strike 3.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill slammed down his bat, helmet and batting glove in front
of the home-plate umpire, John Hirschbeck, who ejected him.
O'Neill's volatility would come back into play in the bottom of the
ninth. With two men on, and two outs, the rookie Shane Spencer
batted in O'Neill's place and lined out to end the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not to take anything from Shane, but you'd rather have O'Neill
up in that situation, yes,'' said Torre, who said he believed what
O'Neill did was wrong but excusable considering the heat of the
moment. ``But you can't worry about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre was concerned by a bullpen that has become more unsteady
as the playoffs near. Even the reliable Lloyd came up empty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a concern when you bring guys in and they can't get a
third out,'' Torre said. ``But it's too early to get overly
concerned with it. No question it was frustrating. That elusive
last out wasn't there.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Cone (19-6) absorbed the loss after battling out of
trouble all day. Typical Cone outing. Just when he would load the
bases _ as he did in the third inning _ he could bear down and
catch Tony Fernandez looking at strike 3. He left the game after
123 pitches and 24 batters in five and two-thirds innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was flirting with disaster all day,'' said Cone, who gave up
four runs, walked two and struck out 11. ``Everything just caught
up to me. I left a mess out there. It was a struggle for me all
day.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the day he wanted to secure his 20th victory and set
the major league record for most seasons _ nine _ in between
20-victory years. He has two starts left to do it. Two starts to
hit a number that few thought possible after the surgery Cone had
in 1996 to remove an aneurysm from his arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking forward to having this be the day,'' Cone said.
``When you're this close, you want to get it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, he was helpless to do anything about it as the
bullpen provided another reason to doubt the invincibility of the
once unshakable Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think right now,'' Stanton said, ``everyone is going to go
home and look in the mirror, and say, let's get back to business,
including me.''
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH
</P>
<P>
   The flu has been working its way around the Yankee clubhouse of
late. Neither Tino Martinez nor Tim Raines was in the lineup
because of it, which allowed Mike Lowell to make his major league
debut as a starter Sunday. Manager Joe Torre wanted to see what
Lowell, one of six players called up from Class AAA Columbus on
Tuesday, could do while the Yankees bide their time until the
post-season begins. With Lowell playing third base, Scott Brosius
took over at first. In his first major league at-bat, Lowell hit a
bloop single to center field. ... The Blue Jays, showing much more
desperation than the Yankees did as they took the series, 3-1, are
just three games behind Boston for the wild-card spot.

POKER-PLAYING `ROUNDERS' CASH IN ON OPENING WEEKEND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Will also move in the ``n'' California news file.) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Moviegoers dealt ``Rounders'' a winning hand at
the nation's box office, giving it an estimated $8.8 million at
2,176 theaters nationwide during the Friday-Sunday period, studio
sources said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rounders,'' a Miramax drama about the world of high-stakes
poker, was the first film since ``He Got Game'' opened in early May
to lead the slate with less than $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Customers, who traditionally cut back on moviegoing after Labor
Day, spent only $50 million overall at the box office _ less than
half the total of some of this summer's weekends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rounders'' benefited from the star power of Matt Damon,
playing a law student-turned-card shark, and the appeal of gambling
to male customers. Robert Bucksbaum, president of the Reel Source
forecasting service, said the film presented a tricky marketing
problem in broadening its core audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's much crossover appeal to women,'' said
Bucksbaum, who predicted ``Rounders'' will wind up with $38 million
overall.
</P>
<P>
   20th Century Fox's surprise hit ``There Something About Mary''
continued its astonishing performance in second, a week after
topping the box office for the first time, with $7.5 million at
2,557 theaters _ a decline of only 15 percent from the previous
Friday-Sunday period and enough to push the comedy's 61-day take to
$139.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   Bucksbaum predicted that the ongoing popularity of ``Mary''
portends a large opening _ up to $14 million _ next weekend for New
Line's Chris Tucker-Jackie Chan comedy, ``Rush Hour.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People really want to laugh these days,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mary'' is now the 74th-highest domestic grosser ever and could
take in an additional $35 million by the end of its run.
</P>
<P>
   New Line's fourth weekend of ``Blade'' finished third with $5
million at 2,389 theaters to edge DreamWorks' eighth weekend of
``Saving Private Ryan,'' which made $4.7 million at 2,705 sites to
give the D-Day drama $173.2 million after 52 days. ``Ryan,'' which
could finish well above $200 million due to its status as a
front-running candidate for multiple Academy Awards, is now the
39th-highest domestic grosser after ``Crocodile Dundee.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney's opening of family drama ``Simon Birch'' performed
respectably in fifth with $3.3 million at only 596 theaters. The
studio plans to add an additional 300 screens next weekend to take
advantage of what it believes is strong word-of-mouth among
moviegoers for the story based on John Irving's novel ``A Prayer
for Owen Meany.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The public loves this movie, so our strategy is to allow it to
percolate first,'' said Disney distribution executive Phil Barlow,
who noted it is a rarity for a film in fewer than 600 theaters to
crack the top five.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's seventh weekend of ``Ever After'' continued to draw well
in sixth, with $2.4 million at 1,937 theaters to push past $57
million overall.
</P>
<P>
   Sony's second weekend of ``Knock Off,'' starring Jean-Claude Van
Damme, nearly disappeared in seventh with $1.9 million at 1,800
theaters. Rounding out the top 10 were Paramount's sixth weekend of
``Snake Eyes,'' with $1.8 million at 1,681 sites, Disney's 11th
weekend of ``Armageddon,'' with $1.6 million at 1,334 locations,
and Miramax's third weekend of ``54,'' with $1.5 million at 1,765
screens.
</P>
<P>
   Expected to be one of the major late-summer releases, ``54'' had
was unable to interest teen-agers and young adults in the recap of
the late '70s disco era, Bucksbaum noted.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's seventh weekend of ``The Parent Trap'' finished a close
11th, with $1.3 million at 1,671 theaters to reach $62 million
overall. The studio's ``Armageddon'' has gone past $194 million and
ranks 26th on the all-time domestic list after ``Indiana Jones and
the Last Crusade.''
</P>
<P>
   Fine Line's limited opening of ``Let's Talk About Sex,'' a
documentary/drama set in Miami, generated virtually no interest
with a feeble $218,000 at 258 theaters. ``Putting the word `sex' in
the title is a mistake, but it will probably do well on video,''
Bucksbaum noted.
</P>
<P>
   Year-to-date business is nearing $4.8 billion and is 12 percent
ahead of the same period last year. Paramount's ``Titanic,'' a
source of much of that gain, drew a mere $55,000 at 337 theaters in
its 39th weekend. Its overall domestic total is $600.7 million, or
$140 million more than its closest rival, ``Star Wars.''

HUNDLEY'S BLOCK LETS METS HOLD THE LINE 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JASON DIAMOS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ For Todd Hundley, catching is very much like riding a
bicycle. So what if Hundley had not caught a game for the Mets in
nearly a year. The important thing was that he had not forgotten
how to catch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm back to my world,'' Hundley had said before his first
major league start behind the plate since Sept. 16. An elbow injury
and surgery kept Hundley from playing at all until July, when the
Mets tried their former catcher in the outfield. That experiment
didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   But Hundley's instincts took over Sunday afternoon. With
Montreal's Shane Andrews racing toward home representing the tying
run with two out in the bottom of the ninth, Hundley thrust his
left leg out to block Andrews' path to the plate as he prepared to
field Brian McRae's perfect one-hop strike from short right center
field.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had no chance of getting in there,'' said Hundley, who made
the tag for the final out to set off an emotional celebration and
preserve a crucial 1-0 victory for the Mets and Willie Blair. The
Cubs also won, keeping the Mets one game back in the National
League wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   Of that final play, Hundley said, ``He was going to have to
break my leg, go through my leg and then go through my shinguard to
get there.''
</P>
<P>
   The first person to get to Hundley after the tag was Mets
Manager Bobby Valentine, whose relationship with Hundley has often
been stormy for the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Johnny would be the one picking me up,'' Hundley
said of his close friend, John Franco, who was backing up the play
after he had allowed pinch-hitter Mike Hubbard's line-drive single
over second. ``But it was Bobby. I was thinking, `What are you
doing?'''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine said, ``Actually, I was two steps out of the dugout to
argue if he was calling him safe.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no danger of Umpire Jeff Kellogg doing that, not after
Hundley had made sure the play was never in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   And by the slimmest of margins, Franco had tied his own
franchise record with his 36th save. McRae _ who had doubled in the
game's only run with two out in the eighth _ began to do a wild
dance in the outfield to celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was about to lay on the ground and start doing a jig,''
McRae said.
</P>
<P>
   Which might sound a little extreme. But the Mets (83-67) came
here Sunday in danger of being swept out of Montreal by the Expos,
and of damaging their chances in the wild-card race with only 12
games remaining.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mets, and Hundley, were able to hold their ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do my talking on the field,'' said Hundley, when he was
asked why he did not celebrate as heartily as Valentine, McRae and
the rest of his teammates after the final out. ``That's what it's
all about. I want to be a part of this, this playoff and wild-card
run. And to do that, I've got to play right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundley was only playing because Valentine asked Mike Piazza if
he wanted one last day off before the Mets make their final
post-season push. Piazza accepted, and Hundley proved that he can
still catch and also bolstered his chances of being included on the
post-season roster _ should the Mets qualify.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a nice step in the right direction,'' General Manager
Steve Phillips said of Hundley.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can do nothing but help this ball club,'' Piazza said of
Hundley. ``I don't see how there can be any negatives at all. It
gives us two great options to go with.''
</P>
<P>
   In his first real test this season, Hundley, who had caught 18
innings in the minor leagues this season, also threw Andrews out on
a delayed steal attempt in the fourth. At the plate, he walked
three times to give him four walks in five plate appearances since
being activated from the disabled list on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   And Hundley's third walk Sunday, off reliever Anthony Telford,
immediately preceded McRae's game-winning double off Rick Dehart.
</P>
<P>
   But it was McRae's online throw and Hundley's instincts that
insured the Mets would prevail in the end.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Both Hundley's and McRae's contributions overshadowed a strong
performance from Blair (5-16), who scattered three hits in seven
and a third innings to win for the first time as a Met. Blair was a
late replacement for Hideo Nomo, who was removed from the rotation.
In two spot starts for the Mets, Blair has allowed just two runs in
14 and a third innings _ and has been given only one run back.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it was enough today,'' said Blair, who was bailed out of
an eighth-inning jam by Dennis Cook, who struck out pinch-hitter
Robert Perez, and then Hundley, who went to the retaining wall to
catch an F.P. Santangelo pop-up, to leave a runner stranded on
third.
</P>
<P>
   And then came Franco, who retired the first two batters he faced
to start the ninth. But Franco walked Andrews on five pitches,
threw a wild pitch and then intentionally walked Vladimir Guerrero
to set the stage for the game-ending play at the plate. ``I didn't
know where he was,'' Hundley said of Andrews, ``but I felt him
coming.''

IN CAMBODIA, MORE DEMONSTRATIONS BUT LESS VIOLENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia _ After a week of chaos in the streets, the
competing rowdy demonstrations and the violence that have paralyzed
the capital began to take on a ritual flavor Sunday as
post-election maneuvers moved toward the bargaining table.
</P>
<P>
   More than 10,000 highly organized pro-government marchers filled
the streets in the morning, chanting obediently at the orders of
men with bullhorns and escorted by armed and helmeted security
forces.
</P>
<P>
   In the afternoon the opposition demonstrators, whom the
pro-government marchers have been mimicking, paraded around the
central market, their numbers swelled to more than 5,000 by
bystanders, until police officers fired automatic weapons in the
air to disperse them.
</P>
<P>
   There was a degree of stone throwing, clubbing and shooting, and
at least one man was reported to have been shot in the leg. But by
the standards of the last week, Sunday was not a violent day.
</P>
<P>
   With a round of meetings among political leaders scheduled for
this week, King Norodom Sihanouk issued a statement suffused with
weary pragmatism that supported the victory of the country's
strongman, Hun Sen, in the parliamentary election on July 26.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a Cambodia that is not a state of law and not a fully
fledged democracy, I have no other choice than to advise the weak
to choose a policy that avoids misfortune for the people, the
motherland and themselves,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was a call to his son Prince Norodom Ranariddh and to the
other opposition leader, Sam Rainsy, to accept the election results
and to reach an accommodation with Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
   The new Parliament is to convene on Sept. 24. The two
challengers have vowed to boycott it, contending that fraud and
intimidation skewed the election.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hun Sen's party won the most seats, it needs to form a
coalition with the prince's royalist party to reach the two-thirds
majority needed to form a government.
</P>
<P>
   It appears that Sam Rainsy genuinely hoped to bring down Hun
Sen. But many analysts have seen the prince's alliance with Sam
Rainsy as an attempt to strengthen his own post-election bargaining
position.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Ranariddh signaled his readiness to deal, backing
off from demands for a review of the vote, agreeing to meet the
king and government leaders and saying that it could be possible
for him to participate in a new government even while rejecting the
election results.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Rainsy remained silent. Since Monday, when Hun Sen
threatened to arrest opposition leaders, Sam Rainsy has taken
refuge at a U.N. office in a hotel and abruptly halted his fiery
speeches.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend a road map for an end to the impasse has taken
shape, pointing toward an eventual coalition between Hun Sen and
Ranariddh and excluding Sam Rainsy.
</P>
<P>
   Such a coalition, in a new form, would reconstitute the mutually
antagonistic partnership that emerged from the last election, in
1993. It broke apart 14 months ago, when Hun Sen seized full
control in a coup.
</P>
<P>
   That possibility was signaled by the concessions listed by the
prince, by his unilateral statements independent of Sam Rainsy, by
his plan to meet the king on Wednesday without the participation of
Sam Rainsy and by the diverging attitudes shown by the governing
party toward the two men.
</P>
<P>
   The slogans fed to the pro-government demonstrators by Hun Sen's
officials Sunday urged the pri/nce to accept the election results
and participate in the government. But they called Sam Rainsy a
traitor who should be put on trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sam Rainsy is out of the picture now,'' a Western diplomat
said. ``He overplayed his hand and he's lost. There isn't much left
for Ranariddh to do but look for the best deal.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For a while Sam Rainsy had seemed to have the initiative. He
organized huge demonstrations and created an encampment of
protesters outside the National Assembly building that lasted for
two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But on Tuesday security forces tore down the area. That touched
off street battles that evolved into huge anti-government
demonstrations that seemed to show the strength of popular support
for the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   As if to counter that final bargaining point in the
post-election maneuvering, the government filled the streets this
weekend with its own huge demonstrations. They were largely made up
of farmers trucked in from nearby provinces and provided with food.
</P>
<P>
   It was a familiar spectacle to Rustam Saltiakov, a Russian
member of the U.N. monitoring team in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reminds me of Red Square in the old Soviet days,''
Saltiakov said. ``A very well-organized spontaneous
demonstration.''

JETS HOPES AND PLANS UNRAVEL 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Now the Jets get to see what life is
like when they are expected to win and don't.
</P>
<P>
   In multiple ways that they had not shown during the Bill
Parcells era, they messed up on offense, defense and special teams
Sunday. That was too much of a triple handicap to overcome, and so
the Baltimore Ravens handed them a 24-10 defeat.
</P>
<P>
   It dropped their record to 0-2, a start reminiscent of those
Jets teams from what now seems another era, but was only a few
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Glenn Foley threw three interceptions, one returned
by the old-timer Rod Woodson for a 60-yard score. Another
interception positioned a field goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, he'll find out about being an NFL quarterback now,''
Parcells said of Foley's resiliency.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the special teams were burned for a 69-yard punt
return by Jermaine Lewis on the second kick by Brian Hansen, who
was playing golf in South Dakota on Friday when Parcells suddenly
summoned him to replace the rookie Nick Gallery.
</P>
<P>
   But if there was a symbol of the Jets' frustration, it belonged
to the offense, which could not get Curtis Martin into the end zone
on three cracks from the 1-yard line. Over all, he had the ball
four straight times once the Jets got to the 3.
</P>
<P>
   His failed fourth-down effort from 24 inches out, with the score
tied at 7-7, spoiled a drive that had consumed more than half of
the second period. The Jets had tied the score on a 4-yard pass
from Foley to Keyshawn Johnson, who outmuscled the shorter DeRon
Jenkins, and another touchdown would have put the Ravens in a hole.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Eric Zeier came in to quarterback the Colts for the
sore-fingered Jim Harbaugh. The Ravens had 99 yards to go, but
Zeier's first pass was a 39-yard completion to Michael Jackson over
Otis Smith. It immediately lifted the Ravens out of trouble, and
they went on to score a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a long week for us,'' Foley said. ``This
is going to tell us a lot about this team.''
</P>
<P>
   If there was rampant fan optimism before this game, it was
understandable. The Jets were going into their home opener after
having taken the mighty 49ers to overtime last week. More than
70,000 fans were on hand, with thousands of them celebrating hours
before game time. Giants Stadium (the Jets simply call it the
Meadowlands) looked like the world's biggest outdoor barbecue.
Youngsters were throwing footballs, music blared from car radios,
the smell of hot dogs cooking filled the air.
</P>
<P>
   But the mood was quickly deflated. The offense never mounted
much of an attack, or certainly one with any consistency.
</P>
<P>
   Martin is one of football's finest runners. But in two games
with the Jets, he has been more dangerous as a receiver. Against
the 49ers, Martin was held to 58 yards on 22 carries. Sunday, the
Ravens, as expected, used similar tactics in launching what often
seemed to be nine men at the line when he had the ball. The result:
58 yards on 23 rushes. Martin was the club's only runner Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Martin caught six more passes for 60 yards, and the Ravens
seemed content to allow him his 10-yard receiving average. But they
were able to prevent was his cross-the-grain running, his darting
to the hole that appears for an instant, his commanding presence
that keeps drives alive with defense-tiring, wearing running.
</P>
<P>
   Why are the Jets having so much trouble getting Martin going?
</P>
<P>
   Parcells, who said last week that pass receptions have to be
counted to gauge Martin, backed off that somewhat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody in this league has a hard time running the ball
against that kind of defense,'' he said. ``They had a hard time
running the ball, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Say this for the Jets. They did not give up trying to run, even
while down by 17-10 midway through the final quarter. But after a
pair of failed Martin runs, Foley threw the ball toward fullback
Jerald Sowell. As if on cue, the 33-year-old Woodson appeared,
stepped in front of Sowell and produced the crushing score.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   That final touchdown punctuated a game of Jets mistakes. Yet, on
the game's opening score, it appeared the Jets were about to put
the Ravens in a hole.
</P>
<P>
   Hansen took the snap on a quick count from his own 23. It
surprised the Ravens' special teams, Ray Lucas said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got the jump on the guy and I was the first one down
there,'' Lucas said. Indeed, he was at Lewis' heels virtually the
moment the dangerous returner hauled in the kick.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he shook me off,'' Lucas said. With that first fake, Lewis
suddenly had a clear road. No one got close enough to bother him in
his 69-yard romp to a touchdown. Only a few weeks ago, he generated
a 97-yard punt return for a touchdown in preseason play. So this
was no surprise to the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   ``No surprise at all,'' said Chris Hayes, one of the better
special-team players in the league. ``He's a good returner, and
we've just got to get better.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Smith, beaten on the 39-yard pass to Jackson by Zeier, it
was this simple: ``I got beat. He got behind me. It was one of
those things that happened.''
</P>
<P>
   But nothing hurt worse than Martin's inability to score with
four cracks from 3 yards out. Martin said he had no explanation,
and Parcells defended his decision not to go for a field goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can't make that play, you've got trouble,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And that is exactly what the Jets had Sunday. &QL;

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Word on the street is that Mark McGwire has
brought baseball back into America's homes again. That's news to
those who've already been holed up in their living rooms, leasing
time on their TV screens to play one of the half-dozen or so video
baseball games out there. Programming McGwire and friends to swat
home runs on a daily basis isn't anything special.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire and Sammy Sosa will be targeted as cover boy spokesmen
for the next mess of home video games _ consider the title
``McGwire's Millennium Mash'' a lock. But measured up against
today's competition, it's Ken Griffey Jr. who has the upper hand in
the category of best video endorsement deal that goes along with a
game worthy of such attention.
</P>
<P>
   Before interest in baseball wanes again _ or, more importantly,
before the latest crush of video football games hit the shelves _
take some cuts with the the cyber horsehide that's out there to buy
or rent (rated on a scale of 0-to-5):
</P>
<P>
   Major League Baseball featuring Ken Griffey Jr.: Nintendo
software, $49.95.
</P>
<P>
   Geared toward the total hitting experience (surprised?), the
object for the batter is to align his orange dotted circle with the
small white square (where the pitch is coming) in the time between
the delivery and contact. Master this, and it's a swatfest. The
bigger the circle, the better the hitter. Animation ranks
first-rate as batters flinch at inside pitches and shake their
heads when they whiff. Tops also in selection of viewing angles,
graphics and sound. Rating: 4{.
</P>
<P>
   All Star 99: Acclaim, $59.95.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado's Larry Walker, who lends his likeness to this game,
also writes in the instruction manual that his favorite part is the
Create-A-Player mode, where you can make up a ``Frankenstein-sized
forkball pitcher'' serving up taters to squatty power hitters. Hey,
Lar, most games have this element, too. The creators could have
devoted more time to making the game a little easier to play,
especially from the mound. Player realism is top-notch (in fact,
Griffey's batting stance looks more like his own here than in his
video-endorsed version), as are graphics. Rating: 4.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Piazza StrikeZone: Good Times Interactive, $39.95.
</P>
<P>
   Originally priced at $54.95, it's become a collector's item for
anyone who wishes o' No.31 was still wearing Dodger blue (although
in this game, the color is more like Dodger teal). Of course, you
can adjust the rosters and put Piazza on... what team is he on
today? Or you can be nostalgic and pull up the Dodgers' starting
lineup provided, which includes Billy Ashley hitting seventh and
playing center field. You know Piazza had something to do with
having him in his game. Rating: 3{.
</P>
<P>
   MLB 99: Sony Computer, $39.99.
</P>
<P>
   Ever think you'd hear Vin Scully's voice programmed into a
parallel video universe? Here it is, someone with the foresight to
have recorded calls by the Dodgers icon so he can forever make
home-run calls and refer to curveballs as ``the deuce.'' Only
problem, there's no storytelling when the games drag on. Add to the
all-American element is Cal Ripken Jr.'s face plastered all over
it. The graphics are major-league caliber and the game play is
crisp. Dodgers public address announcer Mike Carlucci is also
included. And if you play a game at Dodger Stadium, there's even
the sound of a vendor in the stands yelling ``Nachos!'' Rating: 4.
</P>
<P>
   Triple Play '99: EA, $39.99.
</P>
<P>
   A very cool opening with video clips of the '97 season (which is
one edge PlayStation games have over N64). But after that, the only
real special feature is a ``head cam'' that allows the hitter to
watch the pitch from the batter's box rather than from the
catcher's position. The annoying factor is the play-by-play calls
by Jim Huston are about three seconds late. Buck Martinez's
analysis makes up for it a little. Maybe the best part of this game
are the TV commercials that cover boy Alex Rodriguez did for it.
Rating: 4.
</P>
<P>
   VR Baseball '99: Interplay, $44.99.

REPUBLICANS' FALL STRATEGY IS BASED ON MORE THAN CLINTON'S WOES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz., Mo.)  (js) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Faced with a complex new set of political
calculations, Republicans say they want to appear focused on
substantive issues even as they debate how best to take advantage
of President Clinton's woes.
</P>
<P>
   As the pressure on Clinton mounted over the past week,
Republican leaders insisted they were concentrating on the issues
of most concern to their constituents, from tax cuts and the budget
to crime, drug use and national security.
</P>
<P>
   In part, they said, they were motivated by a desire to avoid
appearing overly partisan as the House considers impeachment
hearings. But they also said voters want them to have a positive
message heading into this fall's elections and not just to
capitalize on Clinton's problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best way to expand our majority is to do the business of
the people, not to expect the problems of the Democratic side to
carry us forward,'' said Sen. John Ashcroft of Missouri. ``Their
liabilities are not necessarily our assets.''
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans said there is a division within the party about
how hard to push in coming weeks over tax cuts, spending levels for
next year and social issues like abortion. While some Republicans
in Congress want to press as hard as possible on those issues at a
time when the White House is struggling to stay politically
relevant, other Republicans are counseling restraint, saying the
party should not open up battles that would allow Clinton to change
the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's the view that says that from a political standpoint
things seem to be breaking in the direction of the Republicans and
we should not engage in efforts to pursue our policy agenda that
are not consensual and should let the election be about the
president and his conduct,'' said Rep. David McIntosh of Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then there's the argument that the American people want us to
do our job on the Starr report, but they really want us to do our
job on cutting taxes, balancing the budget and maintaining a strong
national defense,'' McIntosh said. ``People are evenly split
between those two views.''
</P>
<P>
   McIntosh said he came down on the side of pursuing an ambitious
agenda, although not to the point of shutting down the government
over differences with Clinton about spending priorities for the new
fiscal year that starts Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Republicans said, the trick for them will be to exploit
whatever legislative openings are created by the presumed sapping
of Clinton's political strength without handing the White House
issues that allow the president to cast himself as the defender of
middle-class values.
</P>
<P>
   A memo circulating among Republican members of Congress last
week from Frank Luntz, a consultant who is influential with many
conservatives, said Clinton is much weaker than he had been during
battles over changing the health care system in 1994 and balancing
the budget in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``By a healthy 14-point margin, Americans believe President
Clinton is likely to try to distract the nation from his ethical
problems by forcing a confrontation with Congress'' over policy
issues, Luntz's memo said.
</P>
<P>
   But Luntz said shutting down the government over spending bills
would be going too far, with voters saying they would blame
Republicans rather than Clinton, by a 42-32 percent margin, if such
a showdown occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Republicans said, Clinton's troubles have created new
opportunities for legislative victories. Republicans said they now
have a realistic hope of passing a substantial tax cut this year,
believing that Clinton has lost some of his ability to convince
voters that a tax cut, by dipping into projected federal budget
surpluses, will endanger the future of the ailing Social Security
system.
</P>
<P>
   Until Clinton's situation started deteriorating in the last
week, most Republicans viewed their tax-cutting effort this year
primarily as a way to force Democrats to cast votes that could be
used against them on the campaign trail this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the Democrats see a president who's losing his voice,''
said a House Republican aide. ``For Democrats who are caught in a
squeeze about voting for a popular tax cut, they have to decide
whether to vote with their district or hope that the president can
scare people by demagoguing Social Security.''
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said the assumption that the president's
power and influence were in terminal decline vastly overstated his
loss of ability to shape the outcomes of many policy disputes. And
with the country still likely to face crises having nothing to do
with Clinton's sex life, they said Clinton will play as central a
role as ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``He still has the veto pen,'' said a senior administration
official. ``He still has the microphone.''
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said it would play to their strengths if
Republicans decide to push a conservative agenda, especially on
such issues as education and the environment, where the House has
often had to back down when confronted by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's win-win,'' said the White House official. ``If the
Republicans cave, it shows we're still winning our policy agenda.
And if they fight us on an issue like education it will only remind
the public why they like Bill Clinton.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Along with taxes, the biggest policy fights in coming weeks will
be over the spending bills that Congress must pass to finance the
government's operation in the new fiscal year that starts Oct. 1.
Clinton issued veto threats against many of the bills during the
summer, objecting both to the spending levels for many programs and
to language dictating the way some programs are run.
</P>
<P>
   But although they said they ill almost certainly not allow the
government to be shut down _ Congress can pass temporary spending
measures if Clinton should veto any of the appropriations bills _
Republicans said they may prove less willing to compromise than if
the president was not fighting for his survival.
</P>
<P>
   While the need to pass the spending bills and the Republican
desire to push for a tax cut insures that policy debates will not
be completely drowned out by Clinton's battle to avoid impeachment,
Democrats said his limited ability to twist arms on Capitol Hill
and rally public support could thwart any chance of them getting
their legislative initiatives through this year.
</P>
<P>
   Without considerable help from the president, Democrats said,
the party's already difficult struggle to push new regulations on
health maintenance organizations through the Senate will become a
long shot at best.
</P>
<P>
   A hobbled and distracted president will also make it
considerably more difficult for Democrats to build pressure on
Republicans to go along with a proposed increase in the minimum
wage, a key goal of liberals in the final weeks of this Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's problems also raise questions about a variety of other
issues, including how much time he will have to devote to foreign
policy. And his troubles have in some ways demoralized Republicans
as well as Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   After the campaign finance overhaul bill that he co-sponsored
suffered another procedural defeat last week, Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz., was asked if he would continue bringing up the bill in the
hopes of creating more pressure for its passage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not as long as the president has got the problems he has,''
McCain said. ``We don't talk about HMOs anymore, we don't talk
about taxes anymore, we don't talk about Social Security anymore.
There's only one thing on everybody's mind and everybody knows it.
That's the great tragedy of the whole thing we are going through.''

 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Bill Clinton cheated on his wife when she was out
of town, when she was out of the country, when she was upstairs,
and when she had just come home from church on Easter Sunday.
Monica S. Lewinsky also said the president led his young girlfriend
to believe his marriage might end when his term was over.
</P>
<P>
   For most women, it would be reason enough to throw the guy out,
file for divorce, maybe even poison his coffee. But Hillary Rodham
Clinton hasn't said anything unkind about her caddish husband since
the scandalous Starr report of his sexual affair with the intern
came out, and her actions speak louder than words.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Mrs. Clinton stuck to the president's side, applauding
when he profusely apologized at a White House prayer breakfast.
Later, she shared a songsheet with him at a memorial service for US
embassy workers killed in Africa. At day's end, she was radiant and
animated as she introduced her husband at an Irish-American peace
awards ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is the matter with this woman?'' asked Claudia Barlow, a
spokeswoman for Independent Women's Forum, a conservative group.
``I think she allows him to be a bad boy because it elevates both
of them to greater heights of power. But it's confounding.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends of Mrs. Clinton say her stoicism and resilience are
exactly in character. It may look like an act, and indeed, it is
very important politically for the president that she be
supportive. But it's also obvious that throughout her marriage,
Mrs. Clinton has repeatedly forgiven her husband for infidelities
and humiliations that few wives would abide.
</P>
<P>
   Boastfully, the president allegedly told Lewinsky he ``had had
hundreds of affairs; but since turning 40, he had made a concerted
effort to be faithful.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the rumors that she has not forgiven him are
hogwash,'' said Martha Burk, president of the Center for the
Advancement of Public Policy, a feminist group. ``She isn't trapped
in an abusive relationship; she is smarter and more competent than
he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is doing this because it is best for her, for the country,
and for her family,'' Burk said. ``That's what feminism is; women
making choices about what is best for them and their families.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Reich, the former Labor secretary, was a classmate of the
Clintons at Yale Law School, where Bill Clinton and Hillary Rodham
met. He said Mrs. Clinton knows her liberal social agenda would
lose its strongest advocate if the president resigned or was
impeached.
</P>
<P>
   ``At her core, Hillary is a crusader,'' Reich said. ``I can't
imagine her failing to continue to fight for him because that would
be the equivalent of giving up the fight herself.''
</P>
<P>
   Crises have brought other first ladies to the fore. Edith
Wilson, the strong-willed wife of Woodrow Wilson, essentially took
over the presidency after her husband had a stroke in 1919 and was
incapacitated for ths rest of his term. Eleanor Roosevelt bolstered
her husband, Franklin, during times of national trauma and was
greatly admired for her leadership and causes.
</P>
<P>
   Lady Bird Johnson was ``an anchor in her husband's life'' and an
``important force'' in Lyndon B. Johnson's political career,
according to Robert Dallek, a Boston University historian and
Johnson biographer. Nancy Reagan relentlessly defended and
protected her husband and, like Mrs. Clinton, was a woman to be
reckoned with inside the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Though their ideologies were quite different, I see Mrs.
Reagan and Mrs. Clinton sharing the same energy, determination, and
approach,'' said Lewis Gould, an emeritus professor of history at
the University of Texas and the author of ``American First
Ladies.'' ``They are two gladiators who wouldn't give up.''
</P>
<P>
   Up to now, Mrs. Clinton's determination to stand by her husband
has paid off politically. Her popularity has soared in the last
eight months, public opinion polls show, particularly among older
women who once were put off by her aggressive and untraditional
copresidential style. It isn't unprecedented for Americans to
embrace &UR;  &LR; vulnerable first ladies; many admired Betty Ford, Nancy
Reagan, and Barbara Bush when they revealed bouts with addiction,
cancer, and depression.
</P>
<P>
   Some in the White House have lobbied for Mrs. Clinton to go live
and public with a statement of forgiveness in the wake of the
report by independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr. But in the fiercely
protective East Wing, known as ``Hillaryland,'' spokesmen for Mrs.
Clinton are keeping quotes terse and reporters guessing about just
how fragile the Clintons' relationship really is.
</P>
<P>
   Marsha Berry, the first lady's press secretary, said Mrs.
Clinton did all she needed to by saying on Aug. 18 she was
``committed to her marriage and loves her husband.'' Mrs. Clinton
made no public appearances over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Mandy Grunwald was a campaign aide in 1992 when allegations of
Clinton's extramarital affair with lounge singer Gennifer Flowers
nearly sank his presidential candidacy. Then, Mrs. Clinton appeared
on ``60 Minutes'' with her husband to confirm their marriage was
sound. Grunwald doesn't advise that this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this is about her,'' Grunwald said. ``She has
demonstrated her public support for the president, and beyond that,
what happens between them is between them and private.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to gauge the role Mrs. Clinton is playing inside the
White House as a political strategist and lawyer as the president
fights for his survival. In other crises, aides say she has been in
full battle mode, managing the kind of aggressive damage control
the White House waged over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Lewis, the White House communications director, will only
say that the Clintons, since law school, ``have talked about what
is important in their lives, and this will not be any different.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the first lady is maintaining a busy schedule of solo
engagements and joint appearances with her husband. Today she will
travel with the president to New York for a series of big
fund-raisers. Tomorrow she will be on her own when she opens the
new Peace Corps headquarters in Washington, gives a speech to a
Jewish organization, and attends a dinner honoring civil rights
leader Dorothy Height.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady also is in great demand among Democratic
candidates, and many expect her to campaign much more actively than
her husband this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mrs. Clinton has kind of a make-or-break role to play,
particularly with women voters who see the president's behavior as
gross and upsetting,'' said Patricia Ireland, president of the
National Organization for Women. ``Their relationship becomes sort
of a metaphor for his presidency: It's not without serious flaws,
but on the whole, the good outweighs the bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many women go through this in their own marriages and identify
with it,'' Ireland said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. J. Philip Wogaman, pastor to the first family at
Foundry United Methodist Church in Washington, said Mrs. Clinton is
``in good spirits in spite of everything.'' Her religious faith is
``at the root of her life and gives her resiliency, her commitment,
and her fortitude. I know she is deeply committed to her marriage
and to seeing this whole thing through.''
</P>
<P>
   But is the president? On July 4, 1997, Lewinsky said, Clinton
gave her reason to believe they could resume their relationship
after he left the White House. ``I don't know, I might be alone in
three years,'' Clinton told her, according to the Starr report.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that was one of the goofiest and most gratuitous
things in Starr's report,'' Grunwald said. ``If the president did
say it, it's because people say a lot of things they don't mean
when they are in a relationship. It doesn't occur to me that the
Clintons won't be together four, 10 or 40 years from now.''

 IS PRESIDENT JUST BEING LEGALISTIC IN DENIAL OF PERJURY?
 &HT;    (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ There was a point in President Clinton's Jan. 17
deposition in the Paula C. Jones sexual harassment suit when he
seemed to shed his occasional vagueness and uncertainty and became
uncommonly direct.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never had sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky,'' he
told Jones's lawyer. ``I've never had an affair with her.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, eight months and so many revelations later, Clinton's team
of personal and White House lawyers argue that he was legally
correct in that declaration _ an assertion that has been ridiculed
by critics, disputed by many legal scholars, and has infuriated
lawmakers on both sides of the aisle.
</P>
<P>
   Digging himself further into potential trouble, on Aug. 17, in
his appearance before the federal grand jury, Clinton defended his
January declaration by saying, ``I did not have sexual relations,
as I understood that term to be defined.''
</P>
<P>
   The definition of sexual relations that had been explicitly read
to Clinton at the Jones deposition included any contact with the
genitalia or any fondling between the two partners. Lewinsky, the
former White House intern, told prosecutors that she engaged in
oral sex with Clinton 10 times and that each time, Clinton fondled
her breasts and occasionally touched her genitalia.
</P>
<P>
   Independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr, in his report to Congress
made public on Friday, accused Clinton of perjury in both the
January deposition and the August testimony, saying he knowingly
concealed his sexual relationship with Lewinsky, or at least the
nature and extent of the relationship, while under oath.
</P>
<P>
   White House lawyers seem to regard the perjury charges as the
clearest and most significant threat in the report. Asked Sunday if
lying under oath was a serious charge, White House counsel Charles
Ruff responded, ``Of course.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers and analysts now say Clinton and his lawyers are
engaged in a type of legal and semantic gymnastics transparent to
even the casual layman, an effort, they assert, that could doom the
president's attempts to garner forgiveness on Capitol Hill and
serve out the remainder of his term.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really a stretch,'' said Susan Low Bloch, a professor at
the Georgetown University Law Center. ``He is taking the position
that having oral sex performed on him, she's engaged in sexual
relations but he is not. But it also requires him to dispute her
other allegations of physical contact, which is covered by the
deposition.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, White House lawyers Sunday did not directly dispute
Lewinsky's testimony that Clinton fondled and stimulated her during
their encounters near the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't necessarily mean because people recollect things
differently that either one of them is lying,'' said Clinton's
personal lawyer, David Kendall.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el.5l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Invariably, as Clinton's lawyers journeyed across the talk show
circuit Sunday, they adamantly declared that Clinton had not
committed perjury, but they appeared unable to support their
assertion. Each time, they contended that the Jones deposition was
``a mess,'' they said Clinton had made a full admission in August,
and they changed the subject to friendlier terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president did not commit perjury,'' Kendall said on ABC's
``This Week.'' ``Our point is that the Starr report is full of
graphic and unnecessary salacious detail. It's not relevant to any
of the charges.'''
</P>
<P>
   In the Jones deposition, Clinton was repeatedly shown a
definition of sexual relations that included any contact with the
genitalia, breast, buttocks, or groin.
</P>
<P>
   In January and February, in the wake of Clinton's public
denials, his aides repeatedly said he was not involved in the type
of word play that had come to characterize some of his prior
controversies, such as drug use.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sex means sex, even in Washington, I've been assured,'' White
House communications director Ann Lewis said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el.5l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, Clinton's lawyers have repeatedly said that the
dictionary definition of sexual relations includes only
intercourse, and that was the definition Clinton was using when he
provided his answers in the Jones deposition.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el.5l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``The White House is the only group of people who can see
ambiguity in the questions,'' said Jonathan Turley, a professor of
law at George Washington University. ``There is no question that
the president repeatedly and clearly lied under oath. Moreover,
there is little question that he repeated some of that false
testimony before the federal grand jury.''

 WASHINGTON: yet heard.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ruff asserted on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' that perjury does not
warrant the initiation of impeachment hearings, nor does any of the
other presidential behavior so graphically described in Starr's
report
</P>
<P>
   ``The president of the United States, whatever he did _ and he
has misled the American people and he has engaged in wrongful
sexual conduct with Ms. Lewinsky _ what he didn't do is do anything
that warrants the beginning of the impeachment process,'' Ruff
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff said that lying under oath is ``clearly not'' grounds for
impeachment, a view repeated by David Kendall, the president's
private attorney, in a separate television interview.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's denial of a sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky
originally came in the Jones lawsuit, in which Mrs. Jones alleged
that the president made a crude advance while he was governor of
Arkansas and she was a low-level state employee. Mrs. Jones'
lawyers asked Clinton a series of questions about his relationship
with Ms. Lewinsky and the president repeatedly denied that he had
engaged in sexual relations with her under a detailed definition of
the term that includes touching of the breasts and genitals. Ms.
Lewinsky testified that their sexual encounters almost always
included such touching, as well as oral sex.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall said that the president ``absolutely'' sought to mislead
Ms. Jones' attorneys during the Jan. 17 deposition, but excused his
action as justified by the context.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was an arena in which his political enemies were out to
destroy him in a frivolous case that was then dismissed,'' Kendall
said. ``He did not perjure himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if he had, Kendall declared, ``No prosecutor from the
United States on the basis of this interchange would bring a
perjury prosecution.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House was also preparing to announce as early as
Monday the hiring of several new lawyers and political advisers to
augment the president's defense team. Among those being considered
for a top post on the White House damage-control squad is Gregory
Craig, a former aide to Sen. Edward Kennedy and currently the
director of policy planning at the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   Craig, a former law partner of Kendall's and longtime friend of
Hillary Rodham Clinton, said in a brief telephone interview on
Sunday that he was still weighing the White House offer.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As the White House pursued its defense strategy, there were
signs from Democrats both of continued slippage and of steadying
support for the president.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., has been one of the president's most
reliable allies throughout his travails, but over the weekend he
expressed anger at Clinton's parsimony with the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``He lies by being technically accurate. I wish he would stop
it,'' Frank said in an interview Saturday with a Fall River, Mass.,
radio station. ``He's not 14 anymore trying to outsmart the
principal.''
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview on Sunday, Frank said that he believed
Clinton would survive the current crisis, but as a president who
had been ``diminished politically and discredited personally.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in a quandary,'' said Rep. David Skaggs, D-Colo., who is
retiring after this term. ``Based on first read of all this I'm not
yet convinced we're talking about proper grounds for impeachment.
Yet I'm afraid there's been pretty severe damage done to the
effectiveness of the president's presidency.'' There was evidence
from New York, however, that Mr. Clinton continues to be a strong
draw for Democratic fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Grossman, the chairman of the Democratic National
Committee, said on Sunday that the party had logged what he termed
a ``sort of late-surge of support'' from contributors for a
fund-raising event in New York on Monday night that will feature
Clinton, Hillary Rodham Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and his
wife, Tipper. Grossman said the fund-raiser, which was originally
expected to raise around $3 million, now has commitments of over $4
million.
</P>
<P>
   Although some New York Democratic elected officials have said
they would not attend the event with Clinton _ citing prior
commitments, as opposed to wariness about being photographed with
him _ Grossman said that he had seen no signs of any of the party's
contributors backing off because of the president's difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are saying over and over again that this defining
moment and we want to stand with the president,'' Grossman said.
</P>
<P>
   The public, naturally, sees things differently from the lawyers
and politicians who dominate the Sunday chat shows.

MRS. CLINTON STANDS BY HER MAN
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Bill Clinton cheated on his wife when she was out
of town, when she was out of the country, when she was upstairs,
and when she had just come home from church on Easter Sunday.
Monica S. Lewinsky also said the president led his young girlfriend
to believe his marriage might end when his term was over.
</P>
<P>
   For most women, it would be reason enough to throw the guy out,
file for divorce, maybe even poison his coffee. But Hillary Rodham
Clinton hasn't said anything unkind about her caddish husband since
the scandalous Starr report of his sexual affair with the intern
came out, and her actions speak louder than words.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Mrs. Clinton stuck to the president's side, applauding
when he profusely apologized at a White House prayer breakfast.
Later, she shared a songsheet with him at a memorial service for US
embassy workers killed in Africa. At day's end, she was radiant and
animated as she introduced her husband at an Irish-American peace
awards ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is the matter with this woman?'' asked Claudia Barlow, a
spokeswoman for Independent Women's Forum, a conservative group.
``I think she allows him to be a bad boy because it elevates both
of them to greater heights of power. But it's confounding.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends of Mrs. Clinton say her stoicism and resilience are
exactly in character. It may look like an act, and indeed, it is
very important politically for the president that she be
supportive. But it's also obvious that throughout her marriage,
Mrs. Clinton has repeatedly forgiven her husband for infidelities
and humiliations that few wives would abide.
</P>
<P>
   Boastfully, the president allegedly told Lewinsky he ``had had
hundreds of affairs; but since turning 40, he had made a concerted
effort to be faithful.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the rumors that she has not forgiven him are
hogwash,'' said Martha Burk, president of the Center for the
Advancement of Public Policy, a feminist group. ``She isn't trapped
in an abusive relationship; she is smarter and more competent than
he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is doing this because it is best for her, for the country,
and for her family,'' Burk said. ``That's what feminism is; women
making choices about what is best for them and their families.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Reich, the former Labor secretary, was a classmate of the
Clintons at Yale Law School, where Bill Clinton and Hillary Rodham
met. He said Mrs. Clinton knows her liberal social agenda would
lose its strongest advocate if the president resigned or was
impeached.
</P>
<P>
   ``At her core, Hillary is a crusader,'' Reich said. ``I can't
imagine her failing to continue to fight for him because that would
be the equivalent of giving up the fight herself.''
</P>
<P>
   Crises have brought other first ladies to the fore. Edith
Wilson, the strong-willed wife of Woodrow Wilson, essentially took
over the presidency after her husband had a stroke in 1919 and was
incapacitated for ths rest of his term. Eleanor Roosevelt bolstered
her husband, Franklin, during times of national trauma and was
greatly admired for her leadership and causes.
</P>
<P>
   Lady Bird Johnson was ``an anchor in her husband's life'' and an
``important force'' in Lyndon B. Johnson's political career,
according to Robert Dallek, a Boston University historian and
Johnson biographer. Nancy Reagan relentlessly defended and
protected her husband and, like Mrs. Clinton, was a woman to be
reckoned with inside the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Though their ideologies were quite different, I see Mrs.
Reagan and Mrs. Clinton sharing the same energy, determination, and
approach,'' said Lewis Gould, an emeritus professor of history at
the University of Texas and the author of ``American First
Ladies.'' ``They are two gladiators who wouldn't give up.''
</P>
<P>
   Up to now, Mrs. Clinton's determination to stand by her husband
has paid off politically. Her popularity has soared in the last
eight months, public opinion polls show, particularly among older
women who once were put off by her aggressive and untraditional
copresidential style. It isn't unprecedented for Americans to
embrace &UR;  &LR; vulnerable first ladies; many admired Betty Ford, Nancy
Reagan, and Barbara Bush when they revealed bouts with addiction,
cancer, and depression.
</P>
<P>
   Some in the White House have lobbied for Mrs. Clinton to go live
and public with a statement of forgiveness in the wake of the
report by independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr. But in the fiercely
protective East Wing, known as ``Hillaryland,'' spokesmen for Mrs.
Clinton are keeping quotes terse and reporters guessing about just
how fragile the Clintons' relationship really is.
</P>
<P>
   Marsha Berry, the first lady's press secretary, said Mrs.
Clinton did all she needed to by saying on Aug. 18 she was
``committed to her marriage and loves her husband.'' Mrs. Clinton
made no public appearances over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Mandy Grunwald was a campaign aide in 1992 when allegations of
Clinton's extramarital affair with lounge singer Gennifer Flowers
nearly sank his presidential candidacy. Then, Mrs. Clinton appeared
on ``60 Minutes'' with her husband to confirm their marriage was
sound. Grunwald doesn't advise that this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this is about her,'' Grunwald said. ``She has
demonstrated her public support for the president, and beyond that,
what happens between them is between them and private.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to gauge the role Mrs. Clinton is playing inside the
White House as a political strategist and lawyer as the president
fights for his survival. In other crises, aides say she has been in
full battle mode, managing the kind of aggressive damage control
the White House waged over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Lewis, the White House communications director, will only
say that the Clintons, since law school, ``have talked about what
is important in their lives, and this will not be any different.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the first lady is maintaining a busy schedule of solo
engagements and joint appearances with her husband. Today she will
travel with the president to New York for a series of big
fund-raisers. Tomorrow she will be on her own when she opens the
new Peace Corps headquarters in Washington, gives a speech to a
Jewish organization, and attends a dinner honoring civil rights
leader Dorothy Height.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady also is in great demand among Democratic
candidates, and many expect her to campaign much more actively than
her husband this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mrs. Clinton has kind of a make-or-break role to play,
particularly with women voters who see the president's behavior as
gross and upsetting,'' said Patricia Ireland, president of the
National Organization for Women. ``Their relationship becomes sort
of a metaphor for his presidency: It's not without serious flaws,
but on the whole, the good outweighs the bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many women go through this in their own marriages and identify
with it,'' Ireland said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. J. Philip Wogaman, pastor to the first family at
Foundry United Methodist Church in Washington, said Mrs. Clinton is
``in good spirits in spite of everything.'' Her religious faith is
``at the root of her life and gives her resiliency, her commitment,
and her fortitude. I know she is deeply committed to her marriage
and to seeing this whole thing through.''
</P>
<P>
   But is the president? On July 4, 1997, Lewinsky said, Clinton
gave her reason to believe they could resume their relationship
after he left the White House. ``I don't know, I might be alone in
three years,'' Clinton told her, according to the Starr report.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that was one of the goofiest and most gratuitous
things in Starr's report,'' Grunwald said. ``If the president did
say it, it's because people say a lot of things they don't mean
when they are in a relationship. It doesn't occur to me that the
Clintons won't be together four, 10 or 40 years from now.''

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The fifth anniversary of the Oslo peace accords took
place here Sunday with a third day of violent unrest and Israel's
closing of the West Bank and Gaza Strip as an American envoy
continued to hammer at the impasse in negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   As the envoy, Dennis Ross, visited Cairo, Egypt, as he shuttled
between Palestinians and Israelis, a palpable pessimism descended
over those who had initial hopes that his visit would produce a
breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the pessimism was fresh anxiety that a terrorist attack
could be imminent in retaliation for the Israeli Army's killing of
two Islamic militants last week on the day after Ross arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials said Sunday that they would bury the men, two
brothers who were key operatives in the Hamas movement, rather than
release the bodies to their family for a public funeral that could
escalate into a riot.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, an Israeli general altered the official
account of the killings.
</P>
<P>
   In earlier statements, the army said that it had raided a safe
house on Thursday afternoon and gunned down its occupants only to
discover after the fact that the dead were two long-wanted
fugitives, Imad and Adel Awadallah.
</P>
<P>
   But in a briefing for foreign journalists Sunday, Maj. Gen.
Joseph Ya'alon said that when he ordered troops to storm the
farmhouse outside Hebron on Thursday afternoon, he expected them to
find the brothers.
</P>
<P>
   Yaalon said that the house's owner, a Hebron merchant, had been
interrogated and told the Israelis the brothers were inside
sleeping.
</P>
<P>
   He said that troops had begun surveillance of the house after
hearing explosions in the surrounding fields, although, he added,
no evidence of explosions was later found.
</P>
<P>
   The general said Sunday that he had ordered the soldiers to try
to arrest the brothers so they could be interrogated. The soldiers
sent in dogs first, then followed, shooting before the brothers had
a chance to draw the weapons they wore on their hips, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the situation,'' he said, ``they found themselves forced to
fire and kill them.''
</P>
<P>
   While a spokesman said the army officially denied any assistance
by Palestinian security forces _ an active rumor here since one of
the brothers had escaped recently from a Palestinian jail _ Yaalon
said he would ``neither confirm or deny.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Palestinian commanders are blamed as collaborators by
Palestinian society'' when they cooperate, so any such cooperation
needs to remain secret, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The general's statement illuminated just how much the Israeli
action had thrown a wrench into the peace negotiations. Ross has
been trying to get the two sides to sign a memorandum elucidating
their cooperation on security issues. But both face pressures not
to capitulate.
</P>
<P>
   After the killings, Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader,
cannot appear to be cooperating too readily, according to an
Israeli expert close to the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   And the Israelis must underscore the very active threat posed by
Palestinian terrorism to justify not only their military action but
also the closures, which bar Palestinians from entering Israel and
are expected to remain through the Jewish High Holy Days next week.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the prime minister's press office chose to mark the
fifth anniversary of the signing of the Oslo accords by sending out
new statistics on Israelis killed by terrorists in the last five
years.
</P>
<P>
   Hamas, which has not carried out a suicide bombing in a year,
has vowed to do so in retaliation for the brothers' slaying.
</P>
<P>
   But Israeli intelligence experts said Sunday that they believe
Hamas has been planning another attack since February anyway.
Israelis thwarted what was meant to be a ``spectacular attack'' on
the Haifa bus station late last winter, they said.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Heavy showers and some thunderstorms will produce local flooding
Monday in parts of the eastern Plains and westerm Mississippi
Valley. The heaviest rain will fall near the track of a slow-moving
low pressure area as it moves north from Missouri to Iowa. More
than three inches will fall in some areas. Farther south, scattered
heavy showers and some flooding will linger over parts of eastern
Texas where the soil is saturated from recent rains.
</P>
<P>
   Gradual drying will develop over Mississippi and Louisiana as
high pressure strengthens over the interior Southeast. Elsewhere in
the southeast, very warm weather with abundant sunshine and
moderate humidity will prevail. A few afternoon thundershowers can
erupt in the sultry air over central and southern Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Another surge of unseasonably warm air accompanied by patchy
clouds will spead into the Northeast. Onshore breezes will keep
coastal New England several degrees cooler than the interior. Near
record heat is expected in parts of the Middle Atlantic States and
eastern Ohio valley where sunhine will be plentiful.
</P>
<P>
   Clouds and a band of potent thunderstorms will develop ahead of
a cold front in the northern and western Great Lakes States. In the
wake of the front, cooler and less humid air will spread from the
northern Rockies into the northern Plains.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the west will be sunny and warm. A few thundershowers
will develop along the east slopes of the Rockies where moist air
ascends the sloping terrain.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Graveyard for Storms
</P>
<P>
   Alaska is a place where Pacific storms often go to die. During
the cold season, many storms are born along the Asian Coast, where
temperature contrasts between land and ocean provide energy for
developing lows. The storms are then typically steered toward the
Gulf of Alaska by prevailing high-altitude winds. Just before the
death-knell rings for the tempests, they reach peak intensity,
creating recurrent storminess over the Gulf. Early Sunday, six weak
low pressure centers, which were formerly potent Pacific storms,
were strewn across Alaska, causing patchy rain and snow.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The independent counsel's contention that there is
``substantial and credible information'' supporting 11 possible
grounds for impeaching President Clinton boils down to four
charges: perjury, obstruction of justice, witness tampering and
abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
   It could take weeks to evaluate the effect of the case assembled
by the Whitewater independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, and his
office. But a close reading of Starr's submission to Congress and
the supporting documentation so far made public shows that some
charges rely more on direct evidence, while others turn on
interpretation of evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Perjury is the cornerstone on which rest five of the 11 grounds
cited for impeachment in Starr's report. The report states that
Clinton lied under oath, when he denied having had sexual relations
with Monica Lewinsky, both in his deposition in the Paula Jones
sexual misconduct lawsuit and before Starr's federal grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   The report also charges Clinton with lying about being alone
with Ms. Lewinsky and about the many gifts they exchanged, which
included books and clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky's efforts to find a job form the basis for two more
perjury accusations. Starr says that the president was untruthful
regarding his own discussions with Ms. Lewinsky about her job hunt
and that he also lied about his discussions with Vernon Jordan, the
prominent Washington lawyer and friend of Clinton who helped Ms.
Lewinsky seek a job in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In more than 100 pages of the report, Starr has amassed a large
body of evidence, based on the testimony of Ms. Lewinsky, her
friends, other witnesses, phone logs and physical evidence, to
challenge the veracity of Clinton's insistence that he did not have
sexual relations with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The president has said his denials were based on a definition of
sexual relations in the Jones case that he understood to exclude
the kind of sexual contacts he had with Ms. Lewinsky. That is why
he called his answers ``legally accurate'' in his Aug. 17 address
to the nation, even while conceding that his answers were
incomplete and admitting to the grand jury that he had an
``inappropriate intimate'' relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The report contains graphic descriptions, based mostly on Ms.
Lewinsky's testimony and the contemporaneous descriptions she
shared with friends, of 10 separate sexual encounters between her
and Clinton. Most of the encounters did involve the kind of
intimate touching and sexual contact that does appear to fall
within the Jones case definition of sexual relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president's denials _ semantic and factual _ do not
withstand scrutiny,'' Starr concludes, characterizing his lies as
``abundant.'' Starr rejects the basis of Clinton's sworn denials of
having had sexual relations with Ms. Lewinsky. ``The president's
linguistic parsing is unreasonable,'' the report concludes.
</P>
<P>
   The report also accuses Clinton of lying in his deposition in
the Jones case when he said he could not recall being alone with
Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The report cites evidence that Ms. Lewinsky and Clinton were
alone together on numerous occasions, drawing on testimony from Ms.
Lewinsky, the president's secretary, Betty Currie, Secret Service
agents and a White House steward.
</P>
<P>
   In his deposition, the president also said he was not sure
whether he discussed the Jones case with Ms. Lewinsky. Ms. Lewinsky
testified before the grand jury that she spoke three times to the
president about the prospect of testifying in the Jones case, and
that the president called Ms. Lewinsky at 2 a.m. on Dec. 17, 1997,
to tell her that her name had appeared on the witness list of the
Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   In these alleged instances of lying, among more than a dozen
cited in the report, Starr concludes that the president had a
motive to commit perjury. ``The president also had strong personal,
political, and legal motives to lie in the Jones deposition,'' the
report states. ``He did not want to admit that he had committed
extramarital sex acts with a young intern in the Oval Office area
of the White House. Such an admission could support Mrs. Jones'
theory of legal liability and would embarrass him.''
</P>
<P>
   But the president's lawyers maintain that a ``disagreement about
the very specific details of certain encounters'' would be rejected
as the basis for a perjury prosecution and should be rejected for
impeachment because it rests on ``simple inconsistencies and memory
disparities between only two witnesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most serious charges do not revolve around
descriptions of sexual behavior. But Clinton's defense of the more
serious charges is more emphatic than his denials of lying about
sex, and the support for some of the most serious charges appears
to rely more on circumstantial evidence and logical inference than
direct testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Starr says that Clinton obstructed justice in four instances:
scheming with Ms. Lewinsky to hide their relationship mainly
through allowing her to submit a false affidavit, helping her seek
a job in New York, refusing to testify before the grand jury for
seven months, lying to senior aides knowing they would give false
testimony and helping Ms. Lewinsky conceal gifts he had given her
that had been subpoenaed.

 &UR; WASHINGTON: been subpoenaed. &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Currie and Ms. Lewinsky figure in one of the more serious
of those charges _ the hiding of the gifts _ and there is
considerable conflicting testimony on some important points.
</P>
<P>
   There is no dispute that Clinton gave Ms. Lewinsky gifts that
she failed to turn over to lawyers for Mrs. Jones after they had
been subpoenaed. And both Ms. Lewinsky and Mrs. Currie agree that
Mrs. Currie picked up the gifts from Ms. Lewinsky and kept them at
her home during the court case. Mrs. Currie's lawyers turned them
over to Starr last January in response to a subpoena.
</P>
<P>
   The case against the president is not clear-cut. On the question
of what Clinton told Ms. Lewinsky to do with the gifts, the
president testified that he told her ``you have to give them
whatever you have.'' Ms. Lewinsky, however, said that when she
raised the possibility of hiding the gifts _ saying, ``Give them to
someone, maybe Betty'' _ the president offered a noncommittal or
somewhat ambiguous response _ either ``I don't know'' or ``Let me
think about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Currie said that it was Ms. Lewinsky who initiated the call
that led her to go and pick up a box containing the gifts, and that
she had no recollection of the president's talking about it with
her. But Ms. Lewinsky says it was the president's secretary who
called her and said, ``I understand you have something for me.''
And according to Ms. Lewinsky, Mrs. Currie invoked the president's
name when picking up the gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors tried to reconcile the contrasting versions by
asking Mrs. Currie about Ms. Lewinsky's testimony. The president's
secretary said that Ms. Lewinsky ``may remember better than I.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr evaluated the conflicting and circumstantial evidence and
concluded that ``the president orchestrated this transfer'' of
gifts because it was ``unlikely'' Mrs. Currie would have been
involved without the president's assent.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Currie stands at the center of another serious charge by
Starr, that the president tried to corruptly influence Mrs.
Currie's possible testimony. The president's lawyers call the
charge ``the product of extraordinary, overreaching and pejorative
conjecture.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called Mrs. Currie on Saturday night, Jan. 17, 1998,
shortly after testifying in the civil lawsuit brought by Mrs.
Jones. The president summoned his secretary to an unusual meeting
the next day. There, according to Mrs. Currie, the president went
over her understanding of his meetings with Ms. Lewinsky by asking
his secretary a ``series of questions that were more like
statements than questions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You were always there when she was there, right? We were never
really alone,'' Mrs. Currie quoted the president as saying.
</P>
<P>
   The president told the grand jury he did not try to get Mrs.
Currie to lie and was only trying to refresh his recollection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that this was part of a series of questions I asked
her to try to quickly refresh my memory. So, I wasn't trying to get
her to say something that wasn't so,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Currie's testimony to the grand jury about the meeting
varies at points and is different in some respects from what she
originally told Starr's investigators.
</P>
<P>
   For example, on the question of whether Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky
were ever ``alone,'' Mrs. Currie presented different
interpretations to the grand jury. She testified that the president
and Ms. Lewinsky were either in the Oval Office or in the study
without anyone else present, but she did not consider them to be
``alone'' because she was at her desk outside the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   Another of the statements that Clinton made to Mrs. Currie was
that Ms. Lewinsky had wanted to have sex with him. Starr noted that
Mrs. Currie ``did alter a statement that she previously made to the
FBI,'' when she subsequently testified before the grand jury. Her
testimony was that Clinton's statement to her about Ms. Lewinsky
wanting to have sex with him ``appeared simply intended as a
statement, not a statement he wanted Mrs. Currie to agree with.''
</P>
<P>
   This goes to the heart of whether Clinton was trying to
influence what Mrs. Currie might say in her testimony. But Starr's
report sheds little light on what Mrs. Currie said about being
corruptly influenced.
</P>
<P>
   The submission to Congress said, ``Mrs. Currie testified that,
based on his demeanor and the way he made the statements, the
president wanted her to agree with them,'' but the supporting
footnote does not provide Mrs. Currie's actual words.
</P>
<P>
   Starr argues that Clinton's explanation that he was trying to
refresh his recollection with his secretary is ``not plausible''
and ``conflicts with common sense.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the ``content of the president's statements and the
context in which those statements were made'' that ``provide
substantial and credible information that President Clinton sought
improperly to influence Mrs. Currie's testimony'' and was involved
in obstruction of justice, the report states.
</P>
<P>
   The last impeachment charge outlined by the report is that the
president has abused his power.
</P>
<P>
   According to Starr: ``President Clinton abused his
constitutional authority by (i)lying to the public and the Congress
in January 1998 about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky;
(ii)promising at that time to cooperate fully with the grand jury
investigation; (iii)later refusing six invitations to testify
voluntarily to the grand jury; (iv)invoking executive privilege;
(v)lying to the grand jury in August 1998; and (vi)lying again to
the public and Congress on Aug. 17, 1998.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of this charge rests on questions about motives, not facts.
Clinton and his lawyers do not deny, for example, that executive
privilege was invoked, but they say it was done at the request of
White House counsel ``to protect the constitutional interests of
the presidency'' and not to impede any investigation.
</P>
<P>
   And the last two parts of the abuse-of-power charge lead back to
where Starr's case begins in the first place: Did Clinton lie to
his aides, the country and the grand jury, about his sexual
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky?

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Vladislav Bulakhov and his young 16-piece chamber
orchestra were a big hit when they performed at Moscow's
prestigious conservatory this month.
</P>
<P>
   The seats were sold out. The concert hall reverberated with
ovations.
</P>
<P>
   Yet The Seasons, as the orchestra is known, walked away without
a kopeck to show for its polished performance. All the ticket sales
went to pay the rent for the concert hall.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's artists have never had it easy. With the ruble gyrating
like a yo-yo, their already difficult existence has become even
more tenuous.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate sponsors have vanished. Well-paid gigs for businesses
have dried up. Prices have soared. But Russians are still flocking
to concerts, and Bulakhov's orchestra is determined to survive.
</P>
<P>
   This is how it gets by.
</P>
<P>
   Dmitri Dolganov, a slender 25-year-old cellist who sports a
ponytail, earns about $150 to $250 a month from his work in the
orchestra _ barely enough to cover his rent.
</P>
<P>
   So he plays his cello for handouts in an underground passage
near the metro stop for the Lenin Library, a stone's throw from the
Kremlin, sometimes earning as little as 30 rubles a day _ $2 to $3
at current exchange rates.
</P>
<P>
   Aleksandr Balashov, who plays the viola, lives with his parents
and younger brother in a three-room apartment, and works
after-hours at recording studios for $10 to $15 a session.
Balashov, 25, uses his modest income to help support the family.
</P>
<P>
   Lyudmila Ryzhova, 45, the first violinist, gives music lessons
for paltry sums.
</P>
<P>
   ``The success of this orchestra is the main goal in my life,''
she said matter-of-factly. ``I will do everything so that it can
survive.''
</P>
<P>
   None of them finds anything extraordinary about the daily
struggle to get by. This is not just how many of Russia's superbly
trained music students live. It is also how many performers make it
after they ``arrive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People who are driven by music have a way to deal with these
difficult times,'' said Mark Algalbiyants, a bearded 37-year-old
from Yerevan, Armenia, who plays the double bass. ``When we play,
we are carried away from these problems. We live beyond our
problems four hours a day.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia's economic and political convulsions have not shaken its
position as a cultural superpower. Moscow has world-class operas.
Its theaters are packed. Russian parents still send their children
to music schools, where they study their instrument with iron
discipline.
</P>
<P>
   When Moscow's stock market was soaring and Russian companies
were competing to buy state-owned enterprises, the mini-boom helped
buoy performing artists. Now that the bubble has burst, life is
tougher than ever.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say things have ever been easy for The Seasons.
When Bulakhov founded his orchestra in 1994, he knew he would have
to improvise to get by.
</P>
<P>
   The orchestra practices in a weather-beaten House of Culture at
a Moscow factory _ a building used in Soviet times for cultural
activities. It repays the factory by giving free performances.
</P>
<P>
   To perform in Moscow's prestigious Tchaikovsky Conservatory, the
orchestra must pay the rent in advance _ $2,000 for an evening at
the small auditorium and $5,000 in the large, ornate concert hall,
dominated by portraits of the great composers.
</P>
<P>
   A sold-out performance barely covers the rent. The orchestra
makes money only when banks and other sponsors help pick up the
tab. Even when sponsors cannot be found, however, it plays, for the
prestige.
</P>
<P>
   Raising ticket prices is not an option. Some of the best seats
in the house can be had for 30 rubles a ticket, about $2 to $3 at
current rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our fans are from the middle class and intelligentsia,''
Bulakhov said. ``To spend 30 rubles a ticket is quite a lot for a
family.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   To get by, the orchestra has occasionally secured credits from
Mosconcert and persuaded Russian companies to help underwrite its
CD recordings.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the orchestra backs up a celebrated Russian or foreign
soloist, earning about $100 for the effort. Occasionally, it has
played at receptions or concerts for Russian banks.
</P>
<P>
   Few among the 16-member orchestra try to live on their small
orchestra proceeds. Some play in several orchestras, hoping to join
foreign tours, where they can receive $30 to $40 a day.
</P>
<P>
   Kirill Anisimov, 28, who plays the viola, came to Moscow from
Petrozavodsk, northwest of the capital. He used to make $200 a
month playing for business groups. Since the ruble collapsed last
month, however, he has not received any offers.
</P>
<P>
   ``People sometimes say that real artists should be hungry,'' he
said. ``I guess the permanent crisis in Russia breeds good artists.
Still, a musician should have clothes and be fed.''
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year-old Bulakhov is married to a musician and has two
young daughters. After he graduated from one of Russia's best music
schools, his father taught him how to be a conductor.
</P>
<P>
   His family, however, has never been rich and he is not panicked
by the latest crisis. ``Now that the ruble is over, there is
nothing left to buy,'' he quips.
</P>
<P>
   His major problem now is arranging a performance in late October
to inaugurate the new concert season. It will feature Beethoven,
Tchaikovsky and one of the city's most promising young pianists _
that is, if Bulakhov can raise the $5,000 for the concert hall.
</P>
<P>
   He is persuaded, however, that one way or another the concert
will proceed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will take place anyway,'' he said. ``There is such a thing
as trust in Russia. They may allow us to pay them back later.''

MUCH OF CHIAPAS COAST ISOLATED AFTER FLOODS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico _ After a week of floods fed
by the heaviest rainfall in decades, much of the coastline of the
southern Mexican state of Chiapas continues to be immersed in
turbid brown water, and dozens of communities remain cut off from
food deliveries.
</P>
<P>
   As the flooding persists, President Ernesto Zedillo said its
damage has been surpassed in this century only by the 1985
earthquake that shattered the center of Mexico City, killing at
least 8,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   In Chiapas, 78 bodies have been recovered and 157 people were
reported as missing. Zedillo said on Saturday that he expected the
totals to rise as emergency workers reached isolated lowland
villages that were completely under water.
</P>
<P>
   The waters gouged many holes in the highway along the 160-mile
coast and carried off dozens of railroad and highway bridges. An
airlift involving more than 70 helicopters started on Saturday,
when the skies cleared after 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   About 400,000 people live in inundated areas that are out of
communication and are facing starvation, Zedillo said, and 25,000
whose houses have washed away are in government shelters.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the flooded areas, victims accused local officials,
especially those from the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party,
of favoring allies when handing out the meager aid.

   UMATILLA RESERVATION, Ore. _ The mercury has pushed over the
100-degree mark again here in the high desert, but the tourists
from Germany are undeterred, looking for clues to life in the
American West before every small town had an espresso bar.
</P>
<P>
   ``As children we used to play cowboys and native Americans,''
Klaus Pumple, a 37-year-old construction manager from Stuttgart,
Germany, said recently. ``Now when you pass through the native
American zones in this country, it's kind of depressing, not like
you expected. But also, it is so very interesting to see how these
people live today.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Blackfeet Indian Reservation in Montana, at the high
drama nexus of the Great Plains and the Rocky Mountains, Vicky
Kilian of the Netherlands had just spent another night sleeping on
a dirt floor inside a teepee and was wondering whether she could
ever return to her life as a business consultant in a very flat
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I sleep in the teepee, I feel a lot of connection to the
earth,'' said Ms. Kilian, 29, who is on her first visit to America.
``I have had a fire every night and I have been able to walk over
the prairie. It has a very special energy.''
</P>
<P>
   American Indian reservations, long considered economic deserts
amidst a landscape of general prosperity, are finding that they
have a lot more to offer the world than casinos and art galleries _
they have their homes, their backyards, their stories.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors, especially a growing number of Europeans, are
traveling to some of the country's most remote places, like this
Indian reservation in central Oregon, in search of life many
Americans overlook on their vacations. No theme parks built around
fantasies for these travelers. In fact, some of the biggest new
attractions are rooted in today's world and in authenticity _ even
if it leaves visitors feeling more guilt than vacation relief.
Tourists to Indian country spend their holidays hearing tales of
heart-numbing atrocities or listening to songs in languages that
never show up in Frommer's guides. They come away thrilled.
</P>
<P>
   And for Indians who have figured just how to market this niche
of native society, business is booming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Europeans have been visiting Indian country since the time of
Columbus, but what's really new is Indians getting control of it,''
said Gordon Bronitsky, a Denver tourism marketer who has just
produced a catalog of Indian travel packages that is going out to
5,000 travel agents in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   A cruise ship full of Germans will soon tie up near the western
Oneida Reservation, next to Green Bay, Wis., after the tour
operator reported that visitors requested a stop at an Indian
reservation as part of their itinerary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to sit there and say, `How,' and paint our
faces,'' said Jeff House, a spokesman for the Oneida. ``We will try
to give an impression of how people live today. We're business
people. We go to Packer games.''
</P>
<P>
   Other tribes are trying to blend the old with the new. Will
Tsosie runs what might be called an Indian bed and breakfast on the
Navajo Reservation not far from Canyon de Chelly National Monument
in Arizona. He charges $85 a night to stay in a traditional
earthen-floored hogan, a cylindrical house with no running water,
and a structure in which few Indians live. But he also takes people
to visit the local community college.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our European guests are very well-prepared and very well-read
_ unlike most Americans,'' Tsosie said. ``If they show up with too
much of the wrong attitude, we turn them away.'' Recently, he said,
some people came to the Hopi Reservation looking for a sun dance,
and asked whether they could be ``pierced'' in the chest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We told them they had the wrong Indians,'' Tsosie said. ``Try
a thousand miles to the north, with the Lakota.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberta Conner, director of the new $18 million Tamastslikt
Cultural Center, on the Umatilla Reservation, said, ``We get a lot
of people who expect they are going to find the Hollywood
stereotypes, the beads and feather Indians.''
</P>
<P>
   The center, whose Indian name means interpreter, opened this
summer after nearly 10 years of planning and is drawing visitors
from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Tamastslikt is the only Indian-run, Indian-owned interpretive
center along the entire length of the old Oregon Trail, Ms. Conner
said. The trail, from St. Louis to Western Oregon, has long been a
magnet for fans of heritage tourism. With the opening of
Tamastslikt, she said, there is now another side of the story of
Westward expansion, as well as a history of the Indians who have
long lived in this region.
</P>
<P>
   The Umatilla and the two other tribes that live on the
reservation, the Cayuse and the Walla Walla, sent a delegation to
Berlin this year, to the world's biggest tourism trade show. They
handed out posters of a Cayuse Indian leader in a buffalo headdress
with the slogan ``Nicht Ihr Durchschnittlicher Reisefuhrer,'' Not
Your Average Tour Guide.
</P>
<P>
   Germany is often the focus of the marketing because the country
has more than 300 Indian clubs, where people adopt a tribe or a
chief and study the history. Plus, millions of Germans have grown
up on the books of Karl May, a German author who wrote a series of
stories about an Apache and his white sidekick.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   ``There is this sort of noble savage image, unfettered by
civilization, which they like,'' Bronitsky said. ``God forbid that
anyone should ever discuss that Indians have VCRs and microwaves.''
</P>
<P>
   But a central thrust of the new interpretative center, which is
part of a resort that includes a casino, an 18-hole golf course, a
hotel and recreational vehicle park, is to show how Indians of the
Columbia Plateau live today.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like to be perceived as dynamic, evolving, healthy
people,'' Ms. Conner said. ``That's not exactly what people expect
to see when they visit a reservation.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the fact that these Columbia Plateau Indians have lived
in roughly the same places for thousands of years is a tourist draw
in a country where so many of the human attachments to the land are
ephemeral, tribal officials say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pretty much live where we've always lived, and people are
fascinated by that,'' Ms. Conner said. The center tells a story of
independent people whose lives were forever changed by the
schooners that came over the Oregon Trail. It shows the effect of
disease, of boarding schools that disrupted families and of
poverty. And it ends on a hopeful note, with visions of a tribe
flourishing anew.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are very moved by it,'' Ms. Conner said. ``We get these
notes in the suggestion box: `I'm sorry for everything we've done
to you people.' It awakens a lot of trauma, a lot of fear.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the guilt-swollen effect of some heritage tour sites,
tour operators outside the reservation say there is great interest
in all things Indian. A record number of people, about 600,000,
visited the National Museum of the American Indian in New York last
year, double the attendance of the year before. And near the
reservations, museums report a similar trend.
</P>
<P>
   At the Museum of the Plains Indian, on the Blackfeet
Reservation, near Browning, Mont., nearly half the visitors this
year have been from Europe.
</P>
<P>
   A huge majority of the guests at Darrell Norman's teepee village
and horse ranch on the Blackfeet Reservation are from Europe. They
take pictures of the bison herds that wander around the
reservation, ride horses that are descendants of the mustangs
brought to the Americas by the Spanish and learn about the culture
of Northern Plains tribes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to know what the Blackfeet are all about,'' Norman
said. ``They want to taste our food. They want to sleep on the
ground _ the whole package. They may show up with a stereotypical
image, but they leave with the sense that we have a very alive
culture. We do not have dead arts, dead language.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kilian, the Dutch visitor to the Blackfeet, said she had
considered going to China on her vacation, but chose the Blackfeet
Reservation instead. ``Before I came here I heard that they had a
dislike for whites,'' she said. ``That is not true. I have felt
very welcome.''
</P>
<P>
   One problem that concerns the tribes is trying to hold the line
between sharing culture and exploitation. The Umatilla, for
example, found that many Germans want to stay with Indian families
_ but the Indians themselves do not feel like opening their homes.
The Blackfeet, who are enjoying a banner year for tourism, are
grappling with the same problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always been this question,'' said Ray Montoya, the
Blackfeet tribal planning director, ``of how far we develop this
industry while maintaining a pristine environment and our
culture.''  &QL;

KEY TO SURVIVAL, CLINTON TOLD, IS TO STOP BEING LEGALISTIC
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Several key Republican and Democratic lawmakers
declared Sunday that President Clinton may survive his political
crisis if he abandons his technical defense against the impeachment
allegations. Their remarks provided the first sliver of hope for
the White House in a weekend of uneasy contemplation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the president has a chance of getting through it,''
said Senator Orrin Hatch, chairman of the Senate Judiciary
Committee. ``But quit splitting legal hairs. If they'll quit
playing this legal game, and start being what he is, a basically
warm, winning person who the American people have liked from the
beginning, if he'll do that, and just acknowledge, `Yeah, I've done
some really bad things, I really screwed up here,' my gosh, I think
the president could get through this.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch's declaration came as Clinton's lawyers fanned out across
the television dial Sunday in a strident display of defense. They
argued that as unseemly as it was, Clinton had committed no
impeachable offenses in his illicit affair with Monica S. Lewinsky
and his subsequent denials.
</P>
<P>
   The remarks also came amid a growing sense that the House will
inevitably launch into impeachment proceedings in the next few
weeks, though Clinton could ultimately persevere or avoid the
process with a formal censure or reprimand on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton skipped Sunday church services and remained out of
the public eye for the second consecutive day, his lawyers advanced
the awkward argument that the president did not perjure himself in
a January deposition in Paula Jones's sexual-harassment suit when
he denied having a sexual affair with Lewinsky. Clinton has since
admitted an affair, leaving the conclusion that his denials _ even
under oath _ were a lie.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; if,,.1l &LR; Today, Clinton is scheduled to shed the stifling mood
of Washington and the White House for a trip to New York, where he
plans to deliver a speech on international economics before the
Council on Foreign Affairs, then attend a fund-raiser with
Democratic supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers, meanwhile, stepped cautiously into the realm of
opinion Sunday. In a city and system of government driven naturally
to compromise, there is no middle ground in the question of whether
to remove Clinton, leaving senators and representatives tentatively
looking at their constituents before staking a position.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch's comments, made on CBS News's ``Face the Nation,'' marked
an end to what the White House perceived as a deafening silence
from Capitol Hill in the two days since the Starr report was
released. A conservative with a considerable following, the Utah
Republican is considered so crucial to Clinton's strategists that
the president pleaded his case by calling Hatch in his car minutes
before Hatch arrived at the CBS television studio.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Hatch's opinion was not universally held, and even Hatch
expressed some ambivalence. The senator also said the House should
open impeachment proceedings and declared that if Clinton continues
to pursue a legalistic defense against Starr, he could lose his
job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody should be impeached who's been elected by the American
people twice unless you have absolutely strong reasons for doing
so,'' Hatch said. ``Now, if you take any one of these accusations
against the president, standing alone they may not be enough. If
you accumulate them, and put them all together, there could be room
enough to do this in the House of Representatives. My own personal
view is that we ought to follow it through.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some closely watched Democrats _ notably Senator Bob Kerrey
of Nebraska _ urged Clinton to veer away from his legalistic
defense against the impeachment allegations, specifically the
charges of perjury.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you come and say to the American people that `I'm legally
correct, I didn't have sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky,'
you're going to lose,'' Kerrey said. ``I think the president
understands that.''
</P>
<P>
   Other key lawmakers, notably House Minority Whip Tom DeLay of
Texas, said Sunday that Clinton would not finish out his term of
office but would end his tenure either by resignation or
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he will wake up one day, I hope, and put the American
people before himself and resign,'' DeLay said on NBC's ``Meet the
Press.'' ``But if he doesn't do that, I think unless the lawyers
are better than what they've been in the last two days, and can
prove to us that he hasn't committed perjury, that he hasn't
suborned perjury, that he hasn't obstructed justice, I think he's
in real trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if trouble meant impeachment, DeLay replied, ``It
certainly looks that way.''
</P>
<P>
   National public opinion polls provided a mixture of hope and
fear for Clinton. In an ABC poll, 53 percent of the respondents
said Congress should hold impeachment proceedings rather than drop
the matter. In a CNN poll, 56 percent of those asked said Congress
should censure the president. In that same poll, 64 percent of the
respondents said Clinton should not be impeached and removed from
office.
</P>
<P>
   In every network poll taken since the Starr report, Clinton's
job approval rating remained between 59 percent and 67 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Some scholars and analysts began floating the notion Sunday that
Clinton could be impeached by the House, but survive a Senate vote
and remain in office. The Senate, in effect, serves as the jury
after the House in effect indicts a president on charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way for a president to regain legal legitimacy is to
stand before the Senate and answer the allegations,'' said Jonathan
Turley, a professor of constitutional law at George Washington
University, in a telephone interview. ``By exposing himself to
removal, he can regain the legitimacy of his office through a
Senate vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, like Democratic Representative David Bonior of Michigan,
the minority whip, signaled that a congressional censure was
probably inevitable, and even palatable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are a lot of options here,'' Bonior said on NBC
News's ``Meet the Press.'' ``One is to do nothing, which is
unacceptable. The other is some type of rebuke of the president, a
public rebuke by the body, and I think that becomes a very real
option. The other, of course, is proceeding ahead with impeachment
proceedings.''
</P>
<P>
   In return, White House lawyers expressed no immediate reluctance
toward a formal censure, which would allow Clinton to complete his
term and avoid the ignominy of being only the second president in
the republic's history to resign or the first to lose his job from
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The White House goal is ``to convince not only the House
Judiciary but, very candidly, the American people that whatever
they believe happened here, there is no grounds for beginning an
impeachment process,'' White House counsel Charles Ruff said on
``Meet the Press.''
</P>
<P>
   Late Sunday, Clinton spokesman Joe Lockhart said in a telephone
interview that the president had called Hatch in the morning as
part of a ``continuation of the process of reaching out to people
on the hill.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Hatch's plea to Clinton to abandon his narrow legal defense
on the issue of perjury, Lockhart said, ``The president has a lot
of respect for Senator Hatch and what he says. We certainly take on
board any counsel that he provides publicly and privately.''
</P>
<P>
   But such a technical defense continued full bore Sunday, with
adamant denials by a cadre of Clinton lawyers that the president
did not commit perjury in the Jones deposition in January or the
appearance before the federal grand jury Aug. 17.
</P>
<P>
   In his 445-page report to the House, Starr has accused Clinton
of committing perjury in both appearances, saying that the
president lied in January in his denial of a sexual affair, and
perjured himself in August over the extent and nature of the sexual
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   In all, Starr's report included 11 possible grounds for
impeachment, ranging from multiple perjury counts to obstruction of
justice to abuse of office and tampering with a potential witness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Jones deposition testimony is a mess,'' said David
Kendall, Clinton's personal attorney on the case. ``The president
did not perjure himself there. He had complicated definitions. The
questions were vague and ambiguous. There were objections. There
was no follow-up. He was giving responses to a very narrow and
technical definition of `sexual relations.' When he testified
before the grand jury on Aug. 17th, he acknowledged that he had had
an improper relationship with Miss Lewinsky.''
</P>
<P>
   Kendall added: ``In the Jan. 17th deposition, the president did
not perjure himself. He did not volunteer information, he did not,
I'll agree, try to help the Jones lawyers. This was an arena in
which his political enemies were out to destroy him in a frivolous
case that was then dismissed.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the White House, senior officials expressed confidence
over the weekend that Clinton's strategists had finally prevailed
over his lawyers in gaining more control over the president's
speeches and responses to Lewinsky allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Still, asked if Clinton would address the affair in his trip to
New York today, Lockhart said he didn't know. ``It's not like he's
coming to us asking what he should say anymore,'' Lockhart said.
``This is personal for him.''

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
NEW YORK _ Who's No. 1?
</P>
<P>
   Cripes, who knows?
</P>
<P>
   Today, perhaps it should be Patrick Rafter by default. He
conquered the U.S. Open again Sunday, defeating his unseeded and,
ultimately, unprepared countryman Mark Philippoussis in four
largely forgettable sets. The ATP's computer says Pete Sampras
retains the top spot, but there's no compelling reason to accept
the mathematical evidence as gospel.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras has had a mediocre year, save for the Wimbledon
fortnight. Unfortunately, nobody else excelled either, least of all
Marcelo Rios, perhaps the least deserving player ever to earn a No.
1 ranking, which he gained briefly twice.
</P>
<P>
   That's what I mean about the blasted computer. It's not to be
trusted.
</P>
<P>
   The four Grand Slams produced four different champions (among
the women also, by the way) as 14 players appeared in the various
semifinals. Never have we seen such balance, or shall we call it
blah-lance?
</P>
<P>
   Petr Korda, the stick figure from the Czech Republic, won the
Australian Open, then fell off the planet. Carlos Moya won the
French but was served into submission here by Philippoussis, who
answers to ``Scud'' yet proved a dud in his first final-round Slam
dance.
</P>
<P>
   Pete, as usual, smoked on grass, only to pull up lame against
Rafter on America's center court. His thigh injury Saturday
afforded Rafter a virtual free pass to his repeat and, in the
United States, where tennis seems to get lost in the sporting
shuffle, rendered the outcome almost irrelevant on what became a
Slammin' Sammy afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   But in Australia, these are the good ol' days once more in
theory. All for one and one for all it would not be Sunday, with
Philippoussis complaining about what he considered favoritism on
Rafter's behalf from his hallowed elders, particularly John
Newcombe and Tony Roche. Roche, the runner-up to Ken Rosewall in
the last all-Aussie final (1970), was a conspicuous presence in
Rafter's box.
</P>
<P>
   ``Newk's and Roche's job is to work for our Davis Cup team,''
Rafter said, seeking a diplomatic middle ground. ``That's what
they're hired for. And Mark hasn't made himself available to our
Davis Cup team. It's unfortunate. He's the kind of player who could
help us.''
</P>
<P>
   Between 1951 and 1973, when tennis was about as Australian as
shrimp off the barbie washed down by a Fosters, nine Aussies won
the U.S. Open _ and six of them won it twice. On 10 occasions
during those years, two would meet in the final. From 1956 through
1962, only the Peruvian-born Alex Olmedo crashed their finals
parties at Forest Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, in a strictly historical context, Sunday's matchup was
fairly mundane, ranking right up there with a man hitting 62 home
runs in a single baseball season.
</P>
<P>
   Still, by winning, the soft-spoken, big-stick-carrying Rafter _
``a warrior for his country,'' the Sydney Herald hailed him _ did
something Rod Laver, Roy Emerson, Newcombe and Rosewall, the Fab
Four of the amazing Aussie dynasty, never could manage.
</P>
<P>
   He defended his title. And at 25, he stands a decent chance of
trumping them all _ in New York, anyway. Because none of the
legendary Aussies claimed a third U.S. championship, although let
it be said every one of them save for Newcombe was deprived of
multiple prime opportunities. Once they turned pro, they were, of
course, banned from participating in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, tennis' being screwed up isn't exactly a new
phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   The Australian surname most glaringly absent from the U.S.
championship trophy is that of Lew Hoad. A four-set loser to his
contemporary Rosewall in his only final (1957), Hoad never
returned. He had bills to pay _ not that the play-for-a-pittance
circuit was lucrative relative to the staggering sums accumulated
by the jaded current stars _ and chronic back problems had ended
his career before the Open era began in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Laver, with his two calendar-year Grand Slams and 11 titles
total _ the same as Sampras _ is rated the greatest of this
illustrious bloodline, but some who remember Hoad say he's the real
bloke against whom Sampras should be measured. Luis Ayala, who put
Chile on the world's tennis map more than a generation before the
churlish Rios scowled his first, considers the burly Hoad his most
formidable adversary.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Emerson's surviving record of 12 Slams must always be
asterisked by Laver's conspicuous absence from most of the
tournaments Emmo won, it's possible Rocket Rod also made
considerable hay with Hoad out of the way. Laver's '62 Slam, in
particular, is suspect in the eyes of Ayala, who prevented Ashley
Cooper, another Aussie, from perhaps pulling off a Slam in '58.
</P>
<P>
   Ayala, 66 and living in Houston, where he helps out at the
Forest Club (his son, Juan, is the head pro), came from two sets
down to defeat Cooper in the '58 French Open semifinals. Cooper won
the other three majors that year. Hoad also had completed a
three-fourths Slam in '56 before falling to Rosewall at Forest
Hills in the latter's last Slam before being exiled for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I remember,'' Ayala said, ``Hoad beat Laver maybe 17 times
in a row after Laver joined our tour. Lew Hoad is the best player I
played against.''
</P>
<P>
   Affirming who's No. 1 for the ages then is roughly as
complicated as sorting out the proper pecking order for '98. Either
way, Sampras is at best a marginal choice for the top spot. He gets
votes but no mandate.

 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Massachusetts voters are overwhelmingly forgiving of
President Clinton and by a more than 3-to-1 margin are against
impeachment, according to a new Boston Globe-WBZ poll taken after
the release of special prosecutor Kenneth W. Starr's report to
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Despite weeks of unrelenting public criticism of the president,
Clinton's favorability ratings remained high and steady from a
similar survey in late August. Fully 53 percent of Bay State voters
polled offered positive opinions of the president while 36 percent
were critical.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with that support, Massachusetts voters were harshly
critical of Starr and the $40 million-plus price tag of his
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Those polled also were vocal in their distaste for the level of
graphic sexual detail contained in Starr's report on Clinton's
relationship with former intern Monica S. Lewinsky. More than
three-quarters said it was not in the public interest to know the
specifics of their physical involvement.
</P>
<P>
   The survey of 400 registered voters was taken Saturday and
Sunday. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 5 percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
   Though Bay State support for Clinton remained high, there was a
growing sense that his ability to do his job has been diminished by
Starr's allegations. Fifty-six percent of the voters said he had
been weakened, up from 45 percent in a Boston Globe-WBZ poll taken
in late August.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Clinton's contrition campaign of the past few weeks appeared
to be succeeding with Massachusetts voters, who by a more than 2-1
margin said they forgive him for his actions. There was a split,
however, depending on marital status: While 61 percent of single
people forgave Clinton, only 52 percent of married people found him
sufficiently repentant.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how the question was asked, voters in Massachusetts _
where Clinton received just over 60 percent of votes in 1996 _
overwhelmingly wanted to see Clinton remain in office.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether he should face impeachment, 68 percent of
Massachusetts voters considered that action unwarranted, while 21
percent said he should be placed on trial by Congress. Asked about
resignation, 65 percent were against while 27 percent were in
favor.
</P>
<P>
   Opinions on most questions tracked fairly closely between men
and women, but a few showed signs of a gender gap.
</P>
<P>
   While men were more likely to blame Clinton for his current
predicament, women looked more to Starr. Overall, 26 percent of
those polled said Clinton was responsible, versus 24 percent for
Starr and the rest divided between the media, Congress, and some
combination of all those parties.
</P>
<P>
   But among men, 31 percent blamed Clinton while 17 percent blamed
Starr. Fully 29 percent of women, however, placed the blame with
Starr, while 21 percent of women said Clinton was responsible.
Married voters were also more likely to blame Clinton, while single
voters looked first to Starr, saying Clinton was even less
responsible than the media.
</P>
<P>
   ``Massachusetts is the state that has been the most supportive
of him, and this state stands behind him and forgives him and wants
him to be able to proceed with the business of the presidency,''
said Gerry Chervinsky, president of KRC Communications Research of
Newton, which conducted the poll.
</P>
<P>
   ``Massachusetts voters do recognize, however, that Clinton will
not be able to function at the same level as he could before this
occurred,'' Chervinsky added.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the president's favorability ratings remained high, so,
too, did Massachusetts' opinion of the first lady. Sixty-one
percent of Bay State voters expressed support for Hillary Rodham
Clinton, with that support crossing gender lines. Starr won
favorable notice from just 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Starr's motives were highly suspect among those polled.
Some 61 percent said they believed he was motivated by a desire to
hurt the president, while just 28 percent said he was seeking the
truth.
</P>
<P>
   Yet relatively few doubted there would be a price to be paid
internationally now that the report had been released. More than
two-thirds said the allegations would negatively affect the world's
image of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Overwhelmingly, those surveyed found it impossible to escape the
Starr report. Eighty-eight percent of Massachusetts voters were
aware of the report and, of those, 27 percent said they had read
it.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts poll tracked closely with national surveys
taken this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   An ABC News poll found 53 percent of Americans favor impeachment
hearings, while 42 percent said Congress should drop the matter.
</P>
<P>
   But when a CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll took the next step _ asking
if impeachment hearings should lead to Clinton's removal from
office, only 30 percent said yes, while 64 percent said no.
</P>
<P>
   The suggestion that a majority of Americans do not want Clinton
forcibly removed from office was echoed by his continued favorable
job performance ratings nationally. Four separate polls by national
media organizations found the president's job approval ratings
ranged from 59 percent to 67 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts cautioned that polls taken so soon after release
of the Starr report are premature, reflecting an American public
not fully focused on the allegations' content and implications.
</P>
<P>
   ``The activists and the political elites haven't even absorbed
this report yet, much less the American people who have real
lives,'' said political scientist Larry Sabato, director of the
University of Virginia Center for Governmental Studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a distracted public a long time to learn about
something as important and difficult as this,'' Sabato added. ``It
argues for the process to play out over weeks or months, even if
people are tired of it.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton will spell out on Monday a
six-pronged approach for a coordinated international response to
the financial crisis spreading around the globe, in his first major
effort to turn the country's attention back to policy since the
publication of the Starr report on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's aides insisted Sunday that his speech at the Council
on Foreign Relations in New York was scheduled long before the
White House knew that Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel, was
to deliver a report to Congress making a case for the president's
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Clinton will endorse using the International
Monetary Fund's ``spare fuel tank'' _ an emergency cache that is
now down to $15 billion _ to choke off the crisis, probably
beginning with loans to Latin America. He will also call for all
leading economies to worry less about inflation and more about
restarting stalled economies around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The balance of risks has shifted,'' a draft of Clinton's
speech says. ``The industrial world's chief priority must be to
spur growth.'' That message seems to be aimed at Japan in
particular.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a central public role now in fighting the financial
crisis is a complex dance for Clinton. It is bound to raise
questions about why the president, who by all accounts has been
heavily involved in strategy sessions concerning Asia and Russia,
is only now talking publicly about major initiatives, 14 months
into the crisis and in the middle of the biggest threat his
presidency has faced.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, in recent days some of his own aides, along with
global investors and senior officials among the United States'
allies, have wondered aloud whether he still has the moral
authority to organize a global response to a complex contagion.
</P>
<P>
   Some say he should have taken a more public role in putting
together support for Russia last month, in the days before it
devalued its currency and announced a virtual default on its debts
_ though it is unclear that even action by the president of the
United States could have stopped the worldwide run on the Russian
ruble.
</P>
<P>
   ``His speech tomorrow will be useful,'' said David Hale, the
chief economist for the Zurich Group, a financial-services company,
``but because of the diminishment of his own standing it would have
been even better six months ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The concern is that in the coming months Clinton will be so
distracted by the debate over possible impeachment that he will be
powerless to push through an increase in Washington's contribution
to the IMF, or to marshal initiatives by the Group of Seven, the
world's largest economies.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Clinton's aides argue that the spread of the
crisis to Brazil last week, along with the imminent threat to all
of Latin America and, more distantly, the United States, gives
Clinton an opportunity to cast himself as the world leader
spearheading a battle against global recession, rather than a
hobbled president looking for a way to survive in office.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury Secretary, Robert Rubin, urged Clinton to assume
that role more directly in an emotional session he held with his
cabinet on Thursday night. After agreeing that Clinton had made ``a
terrible mistake'' in his relationship with Monica Lewinsky, Rubin,
by his own account, urged the president to take a leading role in
quelling the financial crisis, saying that ``the most important
thing now is the world economy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in a very, very scary time,'' said one leading foreign
official, who has been deeply involved in the succession of
bailouts in Asia and Russia and in the recent panic over Latin
America. ``Clearly, the prospect of a weak American leader only
adds to the impetus around the world to sell.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, the United States has moved from a rock of stability
in the global crisis _ the world's strongest economy and the muscle
behind the International Monetary Fund _ to another potential
source of uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   That impression was fueled in markets around the world late last
week when, just as the Starr report was being released, a House
panel declined to approve $18 billion more for the fund. Other
countries will not increase their contributions until Washington
goes first.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The move by Republican leaders who have long been suspicious of
the IMF, even before its remedies for international crisis became
the subject of wide criticism, brought a harsh response from
Stanley Fischer, the No. 2 official at the fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are decisions of enormous importance being made now
about the role that the United States plans to take in the global
economic system it created in 1945,'' Fischer said. ``It's no small
thing to decide to abandon that system.''
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, while Clinton has often called for Congress to
support the IMF, he has made only a handful of telephone calls
about the issue to members of Congress. That is a sharp contrast to
his marathon effort last year, which ultimately proved
unsuccessful, to press every member on trade legislation that would
have given U.S. negotiators more authority to strike deals that
Congress would not reopen later.
</P>
<P>
   The administration says that the timing has not been right for
the president to get personally involved in such lobbying. But it
is difficult to see how he could ask members of Congress to cast a
politically unpopular vote now, while he desperately needs their
support either to quash an impeachment inquiry or to strike a deal
that would submit him to only a censure.
</P>
<P>
   The International Monetary Fund, meanwhile, declared on Friday
that it is down to its last $5 billion to $9 billion in ordinary
funds to fight the economic turmoil _ a signal to the markets that
it is in no shape to be a lender of last resort for much longer. A
bailout of Brazil, if one is needed, would probably require tens of
billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   So in his speech on Monday, administration officials say,
Clinton will endorse dipping into a backup fund, the General
Agreement to Borrow. That fund has about $15 billion left after it
was used, unsuccessfully, to aid Russia in July.
</P>
<P>
   Russia was sent $4.8 billion at the time, but future payments
have been halted during the political turmoil that has brought to
power a new economic team that seems likely to shift away from the
unpopular market reforms that are a condition of the loans.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Clinton will also call for countries around the
world, especially Japan, to act decisively to write off hundreds of
billions of dollars of bad debts that are sinking their banking
systems, and leading to a credit crunch around the world. But it is
unclear if he will directly say that they should use taxpayer
dollars to do so.
</P>
<P>
   He will also call for a meeting of the finance ministers of the
Group of Seven and emerging markets, probably next month in
Washington, to take stock of broader efforts to improve the
international finance system in the midst of its greatest threat in
decades.

COLUMN: JETS FAIL IN 3 MOMENTS OF TRUTH 1 YARD FROM END ZONE

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ They're not the same ol' Jets, but
they're not last year's Jets either.
</P>
<P>
   With an 0-2 start after Sunday's 24-10 loss to the Baltimore
Ravens, these Jets displayed the defects that should have been
expected early in the second season of Bill Parcells' makeover _ a
virtual rookie quarterback, a new running back behind a retooled
offensive line, a somewhat revamped defense and special teams
weakened by the departure of some players to starting roles. And a
more difficult schedule.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not to excuse the offense's failure to seize any of
Sunday's three moments of truth: three shots from the Ravens'
1-yard line for the touchdown that would have supplied a 14-7 lead
late in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Don't argue that Parcells should have taken a chip-shot field
goal there on fourth down. In that situation, any National Football
League coach worth his headset would go for the touchdown. To do
otherwise at that stage of a 7-7 game would be a shameful surrender
to his offense's not being capable of getting that 1 yard (actually
more like 2 feet).
</P>
<P>
   For Parcells, who goes for it on fourth down more than any other
NFL coach, it wasn't a gamble. It was a go.
</P>
<P>
   ``You got to be able to make that,'' he would say later.
``That's a no-brainer.''
</P>
<P>
   Going for that 1 yard is why Parcells signed running back Curtis
Martin to a six-year, $36 million offer sheet. It's why Parcells
signed guard Todd Burger to a $3 million contract, to solidify the
left side of the offensive line alongside tackle John (Jumbo)
Elliott. On each of those three downs, Martin ran behind Elliott
and Burger.
</P>
<P>
   But each time, the Ravens _ especially middle linebacker Ray
Lewis _ stopped Martin for no gain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were trying to run behind who we think is supposed to be
able to block,'' Parcells said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Raven tacklers swarmed to stop Martin more effectively
than the Jets were able to block.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't expect to be stopped,'' Martin said. ``I just believe
there's no way to stop me. They hit the right hole at the right
time. There's no excuse. I take the blame. I had the ball in my
hands. They stopped me. It's just something we haven't got clicking
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin meant the running game, which means him. Against the
Ravens, he rushed for 58 yards on 23 carries, a poor 2.5-yard
average on an artificial surface that he professes to prefer.
Against the 49ers on grass in San Francisco a week ago, he rushed
for 58 yards on 22 carries.
</P>
<P>
   Other than fullback Jerald Sowell's two carries for 1 yard a
week ago, Martin has been the Jets' only ballcarrier. But he hasn't
had the blocking that even a $36 million breakaway back needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over all, we haven't produced much,'' said Kevin Mawae, the
center signed to a five-year, $17 million deal. ``We've protected
Foley pretty well, but we haven't gotten many yards on the
ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Even being protected ``pretty well,'' Foley was sacked four
times while completing 22 of 32 passes for 247 yards and an early
4-yard touchdown to Keyshawn Johnson for a 7-7 tie. But he threw
three interceptions, two by Rod Woodson, who returned one 60 yards
for the Ravens' clinching touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're having trouble running the football, there's more
pressure on the passing game,'' Foley said. ``When you run the
football, you can do anything you want. The pressure's on us now.''
</P>
<P>
   Against the Indianapolis Colts next Sunday, the pressure will be
on the Jets' running game to excel and ease the pressure on Foley
to outperform Peyton Manning, the touted rookie quarterback. But in
Foley's seven starts as the Jets quarterback, he has yet to put
together a complete-game victory.
</P>
<P>
   Just because this is Foley's fifth season with the Jets, he's
hardly an experienced quarterback. He's going to make mistakes.
He's going to throw interceptions, two of which Woodson pounced on.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know when you throw at him all day he's going to get a
couple,'' Foley said of the cornerback who was a member of the
NFL's 75th anniversary team. ``He's unorthodox. He doesn't always
play textbook defense.''
</P>
<P>
   All the more reason why Foley should have known not to risk
throwing in Woodson's area so often. But it's all part of his
education as a quarterback. Throw and learn.
</P>
<P>
   And with the Jets playing a tougher schedule than they did in
producing last season's 9-7 turnaround from 1-15 the year before,
how soon the line can spring Curtis Martin and how soon Glenn Foley
earns a quarterback diploma will determine how soon the Jets start
winning.

GIANTS GO IN REVERSE AND LOSE TO RAIDERS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ With a difficult 1998 schedule that includes
five playoff teams from a year ago, the Giants had hoped to
stockpile victories early in the season when they faced teams that
have met with less success recently.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants had put the Oakland Raiders, who lost their
season-opening game last week and who won just four games a year
ago, in that category.
</P>
<P>
   Little wonder the Giants (1-1) found themselves frustrated and
disappointed in the wake of Sunday's 20-17 loss to Oakland (1-1).
They also said they had learned something about themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, we aren't good enough to start thinking we can beat
anybody,'' fullback Charles Way said. ``We came here thinking we
were doing all right. Things aren't all right.''
</P>
<P>
   Teammate Michael Strahan said: ``This is a great example of
looking at the schedule and thinking about the games you think you
should win. All that is wishful thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' defeat in what was a topsy-turvy game also revealed
some of the Giants' consistent weaknesses this year, specifically
an inconsistent offense.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants gained just 233 yards, and just 71 rushing.
</P>
<P>
   That performance had Giants Coach Jim Fassel promising changes
when his team meets the Dallas Cowboys next Monday. Fassel said
running back Tyrone Wheatley, who has been inactive for the last
two weeks, might see action.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't come here today ready to fight to win the game,''
Fassel said. ``We were not a mentally tough football team today.
I'm disappointed with how we played on both sides of the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Giants quarterback Danny Kanell, who led the team on a last,
futile drive that fell 30 yards short of field-goal position, said
the Giants couldn't sustain a rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never felt in sync,'' he said. ``I don't know why.''
</P>
<P>
   Kanell's last-minute attempts to rally the Giants followed a
26-yard field goal by Oakland's Greg Davis, a kick that proved to
be the game-winning score.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants had taken their only lead of the game early in the
third quarter when Kanell threw a 25-yard touchdown pass to Chris
Calloway.
</P>
<P>
   The touchdown came one play after the Giants had apparently tied
the score, 10-10, on a 42-yard field goal by Brad Daluiso. But
Oakland's James Folston was called for holding on the field-goal
attempt, a penalty the Giants accepted because it gave them a first
down.
</P>
<P>
   Kanell went for the touchdown on the next snap, throwing the
ball behind Calloway in the corner of the end zone. Calloway made a
brilliant adjustment on the ball, catching it before Oakland
cornerback Eric Allen even knew Kanell had released the ball.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' lead was short-lived. Less than four minutes later,
the Raiders led by 17-14 when Oakland quarterback Jeff George
lofted a pass over Giants cornerback Conrad Hamilton and into the
hands of the All-Pro receiver Tim Brown.
</P>
<P>
   A 43-yard field goal by Daluiso with 59 seconds left in the
third quarter tied the score.
</P>
<P>
   With 12 minutes 28 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter and
the score still tied, Daluiso missed a 40-yard field goal. Daluiso
appeared to slip on the dirt infield portion of the field as he was
executing his kick, which knuckled to the right of the goal posts.
</P>
<P>
   The field-goal attempt was set up by a 39-yard punt return by
Amani Toomer and a 10-yard run from scrimmage by Tiki Barber.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants trailed 17 seconds into the game when Napoleon
Kaufman burst through the middle of the line on the first play from
scrimmage and raced 80 yards virtually untouched into the Giants
end zone.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants, however, responded with an 8-play, 77-yard touchdown
drive to tie the score at 7-7.
</P>
<P>
   The developing rapport between Kanell and wide receiver Ike
Hilliard was on display in the drive as the duo connected on an
18-yard completion and a 10-yard touchdown pass. On the touchdown,
Hilliard caught the ball just inside the 5-yard line and fought his
way over the goal line, pushing past three Oakland defenders.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' running game continued to struggle. Way ran for 21
yards on the team's second play from scrimmage, but for the rest of
the game, the Giants rushed for just 50 yards on 22 carries.
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders were having trouble getting their passing game going
in part from good pressure applied by the Giants' defensive front,
which sacked George five times.
</P>
<P>
   But just before the end of the first half, the Raiders mounted a
drive against the Giants' defense, which was sorely weakened by the
absence of nickel linebacker Scott Galyon. Galyon, one of the
Giants' most valuable players in pass defense, left the game with a
strained Achilles' tendon.
</P>
<P>
   With linebacker Jessie Armstead already hampered by an ankle
sprain, the loss of Galyon meant the backup linebacker Ryan
Phillips saw significant time in pass defense. Phillips, a former
defensive end, is normally a strongside linebacker and is not
accustomed to covering receivers downfield.
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders' final drive of the first half appeared to have
stalled at the Giants' 23-yard line when the game officials
signaled that Phillips had recovered a fumble by Kaufman. But after
a brief consultation on the field, the referee Dick Hantak ruled
that Kaufman had been down by contact and that the Raiders had
maintained possession.
</P>
<P>
   On the final play of the half, Davis kicked a 41-yard field goal
for a 10-7 Raiders lead.

<P>
   DUNDALK, Ireland _ This town 13 miles from the border with
Northern Ireland once harbored so many Irish Republican Army safe
houses, underground weapons networks and gunmen on the run that
police called it ``El Paso.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People here were very resentful of that name,'' said Kevin
Mulligan, 55, editor of the weekly Argus, ``but with time they came
to realize it wasn't too far off the mark.'' Out of a mixture of
sympathy for the plight of Catholics in the North and fear of
reprisals from vengeful local IRA men, Dundalk residents kept any
misgivings to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   When the town of Omagh was bombed on Aug. 15, killing 29 people
in the most deadly single attack of Northern Ireland's three
decades of violence, police suspected guerrillas based here, and
the residents found themselves newly stigmatized. This time they
spoke up.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're saying, and saying very strongly, is that there is
no hiding place for terrorists in this town,'' said John Woods, 57,
a Dundalk lawyer who with Mulligan and four downtown businessmen
organized a protest rally in the courthouse square. By police
count, 15,000 people showed up _ half the town's population.
</P>
<P>
   The most overused symbol in the stubbornly confrontational
politics of Northern Ireland is the line in the sand, but Dundalk,
the one-time refuge of the men of violence, may have really drawn
one. ``We are saying that this is not a part of us _ people who do
these things do not represent our community,'' said Brian O'Neill,
55, owner of a century-old family hardware business.
</P>
<P>
   Dundalk's defiant rejection of its past association with
bloodshed is being cited as an emblem of what is happening
throughout the Irish island. ``I'd be an optimistic sort of person
to begin with,'' said Woods, ``but Ireland is now united as never
before.''
</P>
<P>
   Optimism is a sudden newcomer in the North, but it is getting a
warm welcome. People are daring to put their frequently battered
faith in a political solution to the tribal conflict that has cost
more than 3,200 lives. And there are convincing signs of
cooperation in Belfast between leaders of the Catholic and
Protestant communities who have battled and shunned one another for
generations.
</P>
<P>
   Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing,
and David Trimble, leader of the Ulster Unionist Party and first
minister of the new Northern Ireland Assembly, held a face-to-face
meeting last week, the first time that leaders of the two
traditions had done so in more than 75 years.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday in Belfast, the Northern Ireland Assembly will sit for
the first time, a major step in the fulfillment of the Northern
Ireland peace settlement. Structured under a power-sharing formula,
the legislature was created by the accord negotiated over a
26-month period and concluded on Good Friday, April 10.
</P>
<P>
   Dundalk is a bustling provincial town with storefronts in lively
colors and corner pubs that ring with hearty sounds of blarney.
People driving along congested Clanbrassil Street trade friendly
banter with passers-by. Towns in the North bear legends and murals
celebrating heroes of the sectarian struggle, but the banners here
say only, ``Dundalk celebrates 40 years of tidy towns _ beauty dies
where litter lies.''
</P>
<P>
   Once a center for brewing, shoe manufacturing and building
railway rolling stock, Dundalk has shared in Ireland's new
prosperity with multinational firms like Xerox and Panasonic
locating factories here.
</P>
<P>
   Dundalk was brutally reminded of its old role in the Northern
Ireland struggle by the Omagh killings, though, when responsibility
for the bombing was claimed by renegade republican paramilitaries
called the Real IRA, organized out of here. ``Here we go again,''
O'Neill remembers thinking along with his shock and revulsion.
``Everyone's going to blame Dundalk.''
</P>
<P>
   The Real IRA, made up of former members of the IRA unhappy with
its cease-fire, viewed the peace settlement as a sellout of
republican ideals and set out to undermine it with violence.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials have identified its military leader as Michael
McKevitt, 49, a Dundalk man who once was the quartermaster general
in charge of the IRA's vast arsenal. The deputy chairman of the
group's political arm, the 32-County Sovereignty Committee, is his
common-law wife, Bernadette Sands-McKevitt, 40, the sister of Bobby
Sands, who died in a prison hunger strike that drew international
attention and is viewed by many republicans as a martyr.
</P>
<P>
   The McKevitts live in Blackrock, three miles out of town on
Dundalk Bay, and they run The Print Junction, a photocopying,
picture framing and souvenir shop downtown. In the days following
the bombing, people tacked protest notes onto the store door and
stood in vigil outside.
</P>
<P>
   The couple complained to a local priest that they were being
harassed and that they feared for the safety of their three
children. They have not been spotted here for the past three weeks,
and the store is shuttered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right after Omagh I was listening to one of these talk
shows,'' Mulligan said, ``and people were calling in and saying,
`We should burn the McKevitts out of their house, ostracize their
children, make a point of getting up and leaving any restaurant
they walk into.'''
</P>
<P>
   It was just that kind of behavior that placed Dundalk in the
center of the struggle with the upsurge in sectarian violence in
1969. Thousands of Catholics fled Belfast to escape Protestant
firebombings and shootings, and Dundalk took them in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were strongly sympathetic; they came down in trainloads and
we literally opened our homes to them,'' recalled Mulligan. Many of
the refugees settled in the Muirhevna Mor housing project, which is
still known as Little Belfast.
</P>
<P>
   ``But then later the IRA started to use Dundalk as a base, and
they spread the violence to the south and over the past 15 years
turned to gangsterism and rackets,'' complained Mulligan.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Eamon Collins, a former IRA gunman and author of ``Killing
Rage,'' a book detailing his disillusionment with the organization,
said that Dundalk was central to the campaign of violence in the
North. ``It was a route for moving a lot of weaponry, and it was
where lots of people could rest up when they were on the run,'' he
said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Some 300 roads and pathways crisscross the border, which winds
through the woods, pastureland and mist-shrouded hillsides of
County Louth, and there is no way to patrol it effectively. The
farmlands of the nearby Cooley Peninsula became a favorite place
for hiding IRA arms, and the organization's zealousness to protect
its weapons led to a crime that caused widespread revulsion with
the IRA here.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991 Tom Oliver, a farmer who lived with his wife and seven
young children outside the town of Carlingford, reported to police
that he had stumbled upon a cache on his property. Calling him an
informer, the IRA abducted him, tortured him and shot him dead.
</P>
<P>
   Intimidation was strongest in the politicized housing projects.
Paul O'Brennan, a 57-year-old London office worker who fled his
home in Dundalk in 1974, said he did so to remove his four sons
from IRA influence. ``It was all around, in every pub and club, and
I didn't want them getting into that stuff,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For the middle class, it was less apparent. ``I knew it was
going on, but did someone say, `Joe Bloggs there is a gunman ?'
Never,'' said O'Neill. Mulligan recalled only getting ``the odd
threat'' for something he put in his paper.
</P>
<P>
   Donal Dullaghan, 44, a community worker at the Muirhevna Mor
project, said, ``Before the bombing it was just something we always
accepted. I don't know why we accepted it, but we did. They didn't
wear berets or badges, but we knew who they were.''
</P>
<P>
   The mourners for the dead of Omagh who marched in protest
through the streets of Dundalk a week later filled three condolence
books in the town hall lobby. Many messages spoke to the special
sense of sorrow and responsibility felt here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am ashamed to be living in Dundalk,'' wrote James Miller.
``I do not want a 32-county Ireland. I want a peaceful one for my
children to grow up in.''
</P>
<P>
   In the May referendum on the peace agreement, 95 percent of the
votes in the Little Belfast housing project were for approval, a
telling sign of the community's rejection of violence. ``The whole
republican family is for peace,'' said Liam Adams, 43, chairman of
the community council. Adams, the brother of Gerry Adams, came to
Dundalk 10 years ago, the only one of the ten Adams siblings to
have left Northern Ireland for the south. ``I didn't want my
children to grow up the way I had to grow up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 1, senior members of the IRA visited the homes of
members of the Real IRA and its political committee and told them
to disband or face punishment. A week later, the seven-man military
council of the Real IRA met at an undisclosed spot near Dundalk and
declared its own cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   Collins, the former IRA regular, said it was encouraging to see
the people of Dundalk speaking out and paramilitary groups
forswearing bloodshed, but he added a cautionary note. ``People who
think that physical force republicanism is over don't know their
history,'' he warned.

ETHNIC CONFLICT IN CAUCASUS SHOWS GLIMMER OF HOPE

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   YEREVAN, Armenia _ In a week that saw the first high-level
contact in years between Armenia and Azerbaijan, leaders of both
countries said they were eager to resolve an ethnic conflict that
threatens to ignite the Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict is over the disputed enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh,
which the world recognizes as part of Azerbaijan but which has been
held by its ethnic Armenian majority since 1994. Fighting that
ended that year took more than 35,000 lives and forced hundreds of
thousands from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   A resumption of fighting could be disastrous, because the
Caucasus today is delicately balanced between prosperity and chaos.
Huge amounts of oil have been discovered under and around the
Caspian Sea, but ethnic conflicts in places like Nagorno-Karabakh
could abort the expected boom and plunge the region back into the
anarchy of the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   There has been no substantial movement toward a settlement of
the conflict, and the sides remain so far apart that some fear
another war. But last Monday, the prime minister of Armenia, Armen
Darbinyan, flew to Azerbaijan to attend a regional trade
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Before meeting privately with his guest, President Heydar Aliyev
of Azerbaijan told reporters that he looked forward to ``the
restoration of friendship between Azerbaijan and Armenia in the
context of a peaceful resolution in Nagorno-Karabakh.'' It was the
first time in memory he had made such a statement.
</P>
<P>
   A team of diplomats from Russia, France and the United States
has been searching for a solution to the Nagorno-Karabakh dispute.
They want the mountainous enclave returned to Azerbaijan but given
``maximum possible autonomy.'' Armenia has rejected that framework,
vowing never to allow Azerbaijan to rule there again.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview here after Aliyev's remarks, President Robert
Kocharian of Armenia said ``nonstandard approaches'' could produce
a ``unique solution'' in the enclave.
</P>
<P>
   He mentioned several possible models: Northern Ireland, which
has broad powers to run its affairs but remains under British
sovereignty; Bosnia-Herzegovina, where a joint presidency
represents the three principal ethnic groups; New Caledonia, a
self-governing ``overseas territory'' of France, and Andorra, a
principality that holds a seat in the United Nations but whose
nominal rulers are the president of France and the bishop of Seo de
Urgel, Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Kocharian said he could accept a token role for Azerbaijan in
the enclave to allow it a measure of ``face saving.'' But
Azerbaijan, which is poised to earn billions of dollars from oil
exports, is seeking to save much more than face. It wants
Nagorno-Karabakh back, and could use its coming wealth to build an
army capable of retaking it.
</P>
<P>
   Kocharian said he is not worried about such a counterattack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you sure the rich man fights better?'' he asked. ``In 10
years, who will be ready to fight and die, and for what? In 10
years, any attack on Nagorno-Karabakh would be viewed by its
residents as an aggression against their country. For the
Azerbaijani army, Karabakh will be just a memory. Who will be more
willing to give their lives?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Kocharian rose to power on the Nagorno-Karabakh issue. He is a
former leader of the enclave, and was elected Armenia's president
in March after the army forced his predecessor, Levon
Ter-Petrosian, to resign. Military chiefs suspected that
Ter-Petrosian was preparing a compromise with Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot accept anything less than Karabakh being de facto
Armenian,'' said Armen Aivazian, a historian and foreign policy
expert. ``It should be under unchallenged, permanent Armenian
military control. After that, Andorra could be negotiated. All
kinds of solutions are possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Aivazian acknowledged, however, that there seemed little
prospect of Azerbaijan's accepting such a formula.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally don't see any solution in the time ahead,'' he
said. ``If the situation continues as it is, the chance of war is
not 100 percent, but certainly more than 50 or 60 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Any peace accord would have to be accepted by leaders of the
Nagorno-Karabakh Armenians, and because Kocharian is considered one
of the enclave's heroes, he would presumably be able to influence
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a lot of sway over Karabakh opinion,'' said a European
diplomat in Yerevan. ``He is an astute politician and an astute
string-puller, and as time goes on, he may have a chance to be a
statesman.''

 HACKER GROUP COMMANDEERS THE NEW YORK TIMES WEB SITE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A group calling for the release of Kevin Mitnick, an
imprisoned computer criminal, commandeered The New York Times site
on the World Wide Web for several hours Sunday, forcing the
newspaper's electronic edition to shut down at a time when traffic
was particularly heavy because of the release on Friday of the
independent counsel's report over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of The Times' opening screen, some visitors to the site
at www.nytimes.com early Sunday saw a logo marked ``HFG'' with
images of nude women and a diatribe posted by the hackers that
included attacks on The Times' past coverage of Mitnick, who has
been in prison since he was arrested by the Federal Bureau of
Investigation in February 1995. Officials of New York Times
Electronic Media Co. shut down the site at 10:20 a.m. after the
break-in was discovered. They did not restore service until about
7:30 p.m., after taking steps to secure the site's computers.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Valiquette, an FBI spokesman, said the agency's computer
crime squad in New York had opened an investigation into the
break-in.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Nisenholtz, president of The Times' electronic media
division, said late Sunday that the company did not yet know how
the hacker organization, which called itself HFG _ or Hacking for
Girlies _ had breached its security. But he speculated that the
attack was timed to coincide with the increased traffic to the site
and to cyberspace generally in the wake of electronic publication
on Friday of the report to Congress by Kenneth Starr, the
independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a much more destructive weekend to be doing this than
normal,'' Nisenholtz said. ``We were running 35 percent above
normal on Saturday, and typically Sunday is twice as big as
Saturday.'' A typical Sunday would see about 150,000 visitors to
the Times site.
</P>
<P>
   The attack on the Times site appears to be the first time that
hackers have penetrated the Web site of a major news organization.
But computer security experts noted that attacks on high-profile
targets are by no means rare. Other targets have been sites
operated by the Pentagon; the Department of Justice; Coca-Cola; a
Fox TV affiliate in Chicago; Germany's Free Democratic Party; and
President Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The incident seemed to underscore the fragility of the global
computer network during a period when governments, corporations and
individuals are increasingly relying on it as a source of instant
news and information. Several large Internet service providers
reported record traffic volume over the weekend as people logged on
to read the Starr report, which Congress published on the Web
before it was made available elsewhere.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Lance Hoffman, a computer science professor at George Washington
University and director of the nonprofit Cyberspace Policy
Institute in Washington, said it was fortunate that the attack was
not more malevolent.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, ``the material posted by the hackers is offensive,
childish, threatening and chilling,'' Hoffman said. ``It's a good
example of why we have to bring accountability to the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   The approaching trial in January of Mitnick, a convicted
computer criminal who has been imprisoned since he was arrested on
charges of parole violation and several federal felony counts in
early 1995, also appears to have galvanized some members of the
computer underground. The group that took over the Times site
directed some of its comments at John Markoff, a reporter for The
Times who covered Mitnick's arrest. Earlier this year, Yahoo, the
biggest Internet search engine site, was hacked by a group
proclaiming its support for Mitnick. And in July, the hacker
magazine 2600 led a small protest outside the New York offices of
Miramax Films, which is producing a movie based on the book
``Takedown'' (Hyperion, 1996) by Tsutomu Shimomura and Markoff that
details the pursuit and capture of Mitnick.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the trial date comes closer, we're going to be seeing a
strengthened effort in hacking Web sites to get the Kevin Mitnick
name known,'' predicted John Vranesevich, founder of Antionline, a
Web site at www.antionline.com that tracks hacker activity. Members
of the group that claimed responsibility for attacking the Times
site have for several years been engaged in a war of words on the
Internet with Carolyn Meinel, an author who writes about the
computer underground.
</P>
<P>
   The counterfeit Web page posted on the Times Web site included
text that could be read only by examining the underlying computer
code, which revealed an attack on the writing of Ms. Meinel, author
of ``The Happy Hacker'' (American Eagle Publications, 1998). The
group took issue with her comparing computer break-ins to
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we find the time and effort to hack a few pages, labeling
us `terrorists' will only further annoy us and provoke us,'' the
group's text stated, ``since it is absurd to make such parallels
between two disparate groups. The real reason we put any blame on
Carolyn Meinel is because of her obtuse over-dramatizations of our
actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Meinel said in an interview Sunday that last month a group
identifying itself as HFG attacked the computers of Rt66, an
Internet service provider in Albuquerque, N.M., on which she has an
account.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Schmitz, Rt66's co-founder, said the company was working
with the FBI and local law enforcement authorities to identify
those responsible for the attacks on his site, especially one in
which several customers' credit card numbers were stolen.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Meinel said that she had been the victim of another attack
by a group she suspects may be linked to HFG, based on online
interactions she has had with a person who seems to be involved
with both groups.
</P>
<P>
   In that attack, made on several Internet users simultaneously,
including Ms. Meinel and Markoff, the attackers subscribed the
victims to tens of thousands of Internet mailing lists in an effort
to disrupt their electronic mail service.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Meinel said she was writing a second book, to be titled
``The Hacker Wars.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These people are desperate for fame,'' she said. ``These are
the kids who used to make stink bombs. Now they have the
Internet.''

ANNIVERSARY OF '68 MASSACRE BRINGS FACTS TO LIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By SAM DILLON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ The protest rally here on Oct. 2, 1968, began like
many others across the world in that era of campus revolt and
rock-and-roll. Thousands of demonstrators huddled in a drizzle to
hear student leaders with bullhorns denounce the army occupation of
a university.
</P>
<P>
   Then the sky over downtown Mexico City crackled with flares and
Tlatelolco Plaza exploded in gunfire. Shooting at the panicked
crowd, troops and the police turned the plaza into an inferno of
carnage and screams. When the firing stopped, 2,000 demonstrators
were beaten and jailed, scores of bodies were trucked away and
firehoses washed the blood from the cobblestones.
</P>
<P>
   Like the killings outside Tiananmen Square in China in 1989, the
Tlatelolco massacre seared the conscience of an entire Mexican
generation. Government officials have resisted every attempt at
investigation, insisting that students had provoked the bloodshed
by attacking security forces.
</P>
<P>
   But now, 30 years later, the official version of the events is
under attack as never before. In a new book, a prominent academic
argues that the violence erupted when government snipers, not armed
students, opened fire not only on the crowd but also on the army's
own troops.
</P>
<P>
   The president at the time, Gustavo Diaz Ordaz, orchestrated the
violence and blamed its victims to justify a broad crackdown on a
democracy movement that he considered embarrassing on the eve of
the 1968 Olympics here, says the author, Sergio Aguayo Quezada.
</P>
<P>
   Aguayo's book, ``1968: The Archives of Violence'' (Grijalbo/
Reforma), one of six by Mexican authors on Tlatelolco scheduled for
publication this year, is part of a broad effort to clarify the
massacre.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition politicians have used their growing powers to pry
open some long-secret government files. Newspapers have published
new details. A television network has broadcast previously unseen
film of the repression. Mayor Cuauhtemoc Cardenas has ordered that
Mexico City flags be flown at half-staff for an anniversary
memorial on Oct. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Photos recently surfaced showing Ernesto Zedillo, the current
president, being roughed up by the police as a student in 1968. But
his government continues to cite national security concerns in
denying congressional requests for access to army and other files
that could shed light on the events.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 1968 student movement was the beginning of Mexico's fight
for democracy, but it was interrupted by the massacre,'' said Pablo
Gomez, who as a student was jailed after 1968 and who now, as an
opposition legislator, is a leader of a congressional committee
investigating the event. ``We're advancing again, but the
authorities still want this history secret.''
</P>
<P>
   The cover-up began immediately. Recently uncovered documents
show that newspaper publishers worked closely with Diaz in 1968 to
present a sugar-coated version of Tlatelolco and that the police
closed and ransacked the office of a magazine that published
stunning photos of the events.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, the 25th anniversary of the massacre, intellectuals who
formed a Truth Commission gave up trying to reconstruct the 1968
events because the government refused to open its archives.
</P>
<P>
   Enrique Krauze, a historian, helped shatter the inertia in a
history of Mexico published last year, ``Mexico: Biography of
Power'' (HarperCollins).
</P>
<P>
   Using Diaz's memoirs, Krauze showed how the president's
insecurities led him to view the demonstrators as participants in a
worldwide conspiracy plotting to undercut his authority. ``The
president's account is riddled with fantasies and lies,'' Krauze
concluded.
</P>
<P>
   After the opposition won control of Congress last year for the
first time and demanded access to the long-secret files on
Tlatelolco, the government released 3,000 boxes of papers stored in
the National Archives, mainly from the Interior Ministry. Although
many key documents appear to be missing, some are useful and will
form the basis of a congressional report.
</P>
<P>
   But the government continues to hold on to the most important
documents. A deputy interior minister, Salazar Toledano, this year
declined to give Congress even an inventory of Defense Ministry
papers related to Tlatelolco, saying, ``Those files will not be
opened for reasons of national security.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Among the missing materials are about five hours' worth of
35-millimeter film, shot by government movie crews sent to
Tlatelolco hours before the massacre by the interior minister at
the time, Luis Echeverria Alvarez, who later succeed Diaz as
president. He refused to submit to congressional questioning
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many new historical materials are turning up. Aguayo, a
professor at the Colegio de Mexico, has reviewed not only the
Mexican archives but also those in the United States and Europe. He
has also interviewed scores of officials.
</P>
<P>
   Aguayo says Diaz, following a script he had used earlier against
smaller crowds, wanted just enough violence to crush the 1968
democracy movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't order up a massacre, but he was ready to sacrifice
the lives of a few soldiers and civilians,'' Aguayo said during a
walk through Tlatelolco Plaza one recent afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the violence flared out of control,'' he said, gesturing
to the apartment buildings towering over the site, ``after the
snipers opened fire from the rooftops.''
</P>
<P>
   Aguayo argues that the army, ordered to disperse but not shoot
at the demonstrators, was not told that there would be sniper fire.
The soldiers opened fire themselves, he said, after a general in
command of a paratrooper battalion was among the first to be
wounded.
</P>
<P>
   The government originally insisted that 27 people died, but
others put the body count far higher. Robert Service, who was a
diplomat at the U.S. Embassy in 1968, estimated for Aguayo that
``nearly 200'' had died.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year a lot of new information is coming out,'' Aguayo
said. ``But this wound isn't going to heal.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ This is the quintessential road trip for Vice
President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   In two days of travel through the Pacific Northwest, on Saturday
and Sunday, he talked to enthusiastic crowds about light rails,
planned growth, economic revitalization, Social Security, health
care, education, coastal salmon and affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, he shared the podium with Democratic candidates
and elected officials and starred at eight fund-raising events,
where aides said he had helped local party officials in Oregon and
Washington generate more than $350,000 for congressional and
statehouse candidates.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of all this activity, he made about as much news
as the sun rising. His only mention of the report by the Whitewater
independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, was a hurried and predictable
statement on Saturday _ no questions, please _ that he did not
think the case outlined against President Clinton in the Monica
Lewinsky matter justified impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our story,'' a close aide to the vice president said as Gore
made a speech in Vancouver, Wash., ``is that there is no story.
Maybe after the election, we'll step out. But not now. The country
is stable. Why make things unstable?''
</P>
<P>
   This is the protective bubble surrounding the nation's
second-in-command, a haven of rarefied air that fairly floats above
the political craziness along Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington,
unconnected to any aspect of the boss's relationship with a young
White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the bubble, Gore carries himself like a politician
without a worry, other than standard anxieties over close
congressional races in a year of midterm elections.
</P>
<P>
   Scandal? What scandal? Gore never mentions it in speeches and is
fiercely insulated by his staff from reporters. Two months from the
midterms and two years from the presidential balloting of 2000, he
is but two things above all else, a Clinton loyalist and a
presidential candidate. As his aides say, what is the upside for
him to elaborate now?
</P>
<P>
   And so, they say, Gore's campaign season will proceed in the
same manner as the trip at hand, stuffed with frenzied days like
Sunday, in which he followed a five-kilometer race to raise money
for breast-cancer research with five events before an overnight
flight to New York, where he is to join Clinton at a state party
dinner on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the week, he is off to Boston for an event with
Clinton, then his third trip this year to New Hampshire, an early
battleground for the 2000 presidential campaign. Next week, more of
the same is planned for Michigan and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   For Gore, the bubble is the ideal campaign vehicle. By
assiduously avoiding sensitive subjects, he has cleared a path to
discuss only his favorite issues, administration initiatives that
many Democrats claim have bolstered the economy and reflect voter
satisfaction with Clinton's stewardship of the country.
</P>
<P>
   As a strategy, it satisfies his main agenda, supporting Clinton
and reinforcing policies that would be extended into a Gore
administration.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, Gore's message and crazy-quilt of a
schedule are allowing him to fine-tune his presentations before
partisan audiences. Listeners are beginning to see a politician
wholly unlike the 1992 and 1996 version of Gore, a self-parodied
``stiff guy'' lacking many of the touchy-feely qualities that make
Clinton such a hit along the rope line and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has become more emotive in speeches, more animated and
funnier. One of his best laugh lines generally follows a comparison
of the administration's proposal for a patient's ``bill of rights''
and the Republicans' version, which he calls a ``bill of goods.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, the Republicans are in such discord and disarray,''
Gore says with a straight face, ``that the right hand doesn't know
what the far right hand is doing.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For the most part, the reconstituted Gore plays well to the
crowd, especially in places like Seattle, which are geographically,
and to some degree psychologically, far removed from events in the
nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been doorbelling a lot, and I'll bet I haven't gotten
more than two comments about the president,'' said Maureen
Gallegos, a businesswoman who is running for a seat in the
Republican-controlled Washington statehouse. ``Clinton's sex life
is his business. This district has experienced 20 years of growth
in five years, and that is presenting us with a lot of problems to
talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   For some partisan Democrats, Gore _ at least for now _ may be
the premier headliner to address them as he stumps for candidates,
makes a case for Democratic ideals and raises money.
</P>
<P>
   Paige Richardson, the campaign manager for Brian Baird, a
professor of psychology who is running to fill the open seat in
Washington's 3rd Congressional District _ Linda Smith, a two-term
Republican, is running for the Senate _ appeared ecstatic that Gore
helped draw more than 400 people to a rally at the Pearson Air
Museum in Vancouver, Wash., on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The event raised $30,000 for Baird, whose Republican opponent in
what is expected to be a close race will be decided on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. Richardson was asked whether the crowd would have been
as exuberant had Clinton been the featured speaker, she hesitated,
a clear sign she was happy to have Gore at hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't hear that question,'' she said, smiling because she
did. ``I don't have an answer for that.''

INVESTORS USING BONDS AS SAFE HAVEN FROM MARKET TURMOIL 
</HEADLINE>
   By ARTHUR M. LOUIS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
If the stock market's precipitous plunges and thrashing volatility
have you terrified, you might want to consider investing in bonds.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Over the long haul, stocks perform much better than bonds. But
that may be small consolation if you hold a portfolio of stocks _
or stock mutual funds _ that has shed close to 20 percent of its
value since the leading market averages reached their peaks two
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   If you are like most investors, you probably wonder whether your
stocks might plummet another 20 percent or so before they bottom
out.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, nobody knows for certain. And there are too many unknowns
_ notably, President Clinton's political problems and the potential
spillover effect of the Russian and Asian financial crises _ to
allow a confident guess.
</P>
<P>
   If you have nerves of steel and aren't close to retirement, stay
with stocks, which have produced average annual returns of 9 to 11
percent over a period of several decades.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; With U.S. Treasury bonds yielding around 5 percent and
high-grade corporate bonds less than 6 percent, it's no contest.
</P>
<P>
   But if you can't sleep for worrying, a dose of bonds might be
just what you need.
</P>
<P>
   Norm Boone, with the financial-planning firm of Boone and
Associates in San Francisco, says that in theory, long-term
investors probably shouldn't bother with bonds because of their
inferior long-term returns.
</P>
<P>
   But in practice, he includes them in client portfolios ``to
reduce volatility.'' That way, the clients won't be panicked into
``selling stocks at the wrong time.''
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, bonds look particularly unappetizing at the
moment to growth-hungry investors because their interest rates are
at their lowest levels in decades, thanks to low inflation.
</P>
<P>
   But on closer inspection, bonds actually look pretty good.
</P>
<P>
   The Consumer Price Index rose a meager 1.7 percent in the 12
months ended July 31 _ the latest for which figures are available.
</P>
<P>
   With the 10-year Treasury yielding 4.84 percent at the end of
last week, the ``real'' yield _ the difference between the bond
rate and inflation _ was a respectable 3.14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Real yields of 3 percent or more are historically on the high
side.
</P>
<P>
   During the past 45 years, real yields have remained above 3
percent only about one-third of the time. The median real yield
during the period was about 2.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Real yields measure actual increases in buying power _ which is
all that really matters.
</P>
<P>
   To take a simple example, suppose you invest $1,000 in a
Treasury bond with a 5 percent yield.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of a year, you will have received $50 in interest.
With inflation at 2 percent, the real value of your $1,000
investment would decline by $20, so your real gain would be $50
minus $20, or $30.
</P>
<P>
   That's a better outcome than you would get if your bond yielded
10 percent and the inflation rate also stood at 10 percent. In that
case, your buying power wouldn't increase at all.
</P>
<P>
   The calculation actually is more complicated than that because
the market value of the bond is likely to change during the year.
When bond prices go up, interest yields go down because the annual
interest payment remains fixed.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, interest rates still are trending downward.
</P>
<P>
   Jittery investors, agonizing over the financial crises in Russia
and Asia and fearing a spillover into the U.S. economy, have taken
many billions of dollars out of stocks. They have poured the money
into bonds _ mainly Treasuries, which generally are considered the
safest investments on Earth. That has pushed bond prices up and
rates down.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Two months ago, the 10-year Treasury bond was yielding about
5.5 percent annually _ well above last week's 4.84 percent.
</P>
<P>
   If you bought one for $1,000 at that time, you would have
accrued somewhat more than $9 in interest by now. Better still, you
would have enjoyed $136 in capital appreciation _ the amount by
which the price increased to bring the yield down to 4.84 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That's a combined return of 14.5 percent, which is spectacular
for any investment in a two-month period.
</P>
<P>
   During a speech on September 4 in Berkeley, Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan suggested that the nation's central bank
might reduce rates in the near future to offset the potentially
dire effects of the global financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   That statement more or less ensures that rates won't go up
anytime soon, and it was one of the key factors pushing bond rates
lower last week.
</P>
<P>
   But many observers, such as retirement planner Richard DelMonte,
with DelMonte Group in Danville, think that a Fed loosening has
been discounted by the bond market. It may be too late to ``do the
bond thing,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Ducote, senior managing director of fixed-income securities
with Sutter Securities in San Francisco, advises against locking
yourself into bonds that won't mature in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   A bond investor is guaranteed to get back the face value of a
bond when it matures. But if you buy, say, a Treasury maturing in
15 or 30 years and yielding only 5 percent, you expose yourself to
the danger that interest rates and inflation will rise again.
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, would cause the value of your bond to drop.
Unless you decide to sell at a loss, you would be forced to wait 15
or 30 years just to get your original investment back. And the 5
percent annual interest you get during that period could seem
piddling _ especially if stocks stage a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   While Treasury bonds undoubtedly are the safest kinds, corporate
bonds and municipal bonds may be better buys at this point, some
experts say.
</P>
<P>
   That stems from the fact that the bulk of the money from
frightened investors has gone into Treasuries, forcing their prices
up more sharply. Corporates and municipals have lagged because they
are perceived as being more risky because there is more chance of
default. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   High-grade corporate bonds with virtually no risk of default _
including those issued by NationsBank, J.P. Morgan and PepsiCo _
now typically yield 0.6 percentage points higher than equivalent
Treasuries _ those that mature the same number of years out.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, the spread between corporates and Treasuries has
been only about half that 0.6 spread or less.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been overdone to the extent that the spread has widened
on every corporate bond, regardless of fundamentals, regardless of
exposure to Asia or whatever,'' says Peter Van Dyke, head of the
taxable-bond department with the T. Rowe Price mutual-fund group.
</P>
<P>
   Municipal bonds also boast unusually favorable yields relative
to Treasuries, says Zane Mann, publisher of the California
Municipal Bond Advisor, in Palm Springs.
</P>
<P>
   If you compare issues with comparable maturities, municipal
yields now range above 90 percent of Treasury yields, compared with
less than 80 percent formerly.
</P>
<P>
   Although municipals have lower pretax yields, their after-tax
yields are considerably greater. Municipals are exempt from both
federal and state taxes, while Treasuries are exempt only from
state taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Mann figures that a California municipal bond yielding 5 percent
_ as many now do _ will produce the equivalent of a taxable yield
of 9.13 percent for a California resident in the top federal and
state tax brackets.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no other bonds of similar quality or maturity that
yield that much,'' he remarks.
</P>
<P>
   You can buy newly issued Treasuries in increments of $1,000 by
opening an account with the Federal Reserve. You can apply
electronically on the Web at www.frbsf.org/, or by calling the
Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco at (415) 974-2000.
</P>
<P>
   You also can buy Treasuries in the secondary market through your
broker.
</P>
<P>
   Corporates can be bought in the secondary market through your
broker, usually for around $1,000 per bond. Or you can buy new
issues through any broker that participates in an offering.
</P>
<P>
   However, if you have limited resources, you might want to invest
in corporates through a mutual fund. That way you get broad
diversification, insulating yourself against risk.
</P>
<P>
   Mutual funds also might be your best bet if you want to buy
municipals. Municipals are sold in minimum increments of $5,000,
which means you need a minimum of $25,000 to diversify among just
five issues.

<P>
   Scattershot anger and disgust at President Clinton, combined
with pervasive anxiety about the potential use and misuse of
constitutional impeachment powers, left many editorial pages
groping to find analytic prescriptions to ease the dilemmas facing
Congress and the president.
</P>
<P>
   At least 25 newspapers have called for the president's
resignation, including 7 that circulate 250,000 or more papers on
Sundays: The New Orleans Times-Picayune, The Seattle Times, The Des
Moines Sunday Register, The Philadelphia Inquirer, The San Jose
Mercury-News, The Tampa Tribune and The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution. The Albuquerque Journal on Sunday called
Clinton ``morally unfit to continue in office,'' while The Seattle
Times said, ``Without moral authority, the president cannot lead.''
</P>
<P>
   Focusing on the damage the president's affair with Monica
Lewinsky has done to the dignity and effectiveness of the
presidency, The Journal-Constitution declared on Sunday that ``only
one person can spare us that nightmare'' of a drawn-out discussion
``of a particularly seamy presidential scandal.'' The president's
``only responsible option'' _ resignation _ would entail a
sacrifice that the newspaper said Clinton ``has shown himself
incapable'' of making.
</P>
<P>
   At least two newspapers, The Charlotte Observer and The Detroit
Free Press, argued against resignation. The Observer declared:
``The nation is not endangered by having Bill Clinton in the White
House. Our economy is not collapsing, we're not under attack,
there's no threat of a coup. Surely the worst that can be said of
him has been said.''
</P>
<P>
   The Detroit Free Press, in the home town of John Conyers Jr.,
the ranking Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee,
acknowledged, ``We cannot say we would be devastated'' by a
resignation, but continued, ``For him to resign before this process
is completed would be to cave in to the relentless Starr, and that
could set a precedent that would make future presidents sitting
ducks for their political enemies.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the ideas and analyses that emerged from the editorial
pages reflected ambivalence and a sense of being overwhelmed by the
issues involved.
</P>
<P>
   Should they focus on what was and was not contained in the
report of independent counsel Kenneth Starr? Should they address
the president, the Congress, the voters, or all three? Should they
zero in on sexual encounters and misleading statements? What about
the practical issues of a weakened president's governance? The
legal questions of what constitutes an impeachable offense? The
moral issues of leadership?
</P>
<P>
   The most common warning was crystallized by The Sacramento Bee,
which wrote Saturday, ``The Constitution is the sacred text of
American life, overarching presidents as they come and go beneath
it.'' It added, ``The accelerating hysteria that accompanied
release of the prosecutor's report Friday is the enemy of
constitutional self-government.''
</P>
<P>
   The St. Louis Post-Dispatch solved the problem of which
questions to answer by running three separate unsigned editorials.
Sunday's lead opinion piece argued that the Starr report ``is like
a tower of blocks wobbling on top of the shaky foundation of a
sexual relationship between two consenting adults _ albeit an
immoral, adulterous, pitifully adolescent relationship.'' A second
editorial was titled ``The Peep-Show Presidency'' and said, ``We
hate ourselves for staring, but we can't turn away.'' A third
editorial was headlined `The Contrition Gambit.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times ran two editorials over the weekend. On
Saturday it said that ``until it was measured by Kenneth Starr, no
citizen _ indeed, perhaps no member of his own family _ could have
grasped the completeness of President Clinton's mendacity or the
magnitude of his recklessness.'' It added, ``A president without
public respect or congressional support cannot last.'' Sunday, it
argued that scrupulously careful and fair procedures should govern
any impeachment inquiry in the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Post took Starr to task for being arrogant in his
``aggressive advocacy for impeachment,'' contrasting the Starr
report unfavorably with ``the restraint showed by the special
prosecutor during Watergate,'' the scandal that led to the
resignation of President Nixon in 1974.''
</P>
<P>
   In a clear expression of ambivalence, The Post concluded,
``Clinton's behavior is at the margins of impeachability _
straddling the line that separates disqualifying crimes from
conduct that merely mars indelibly the presidential office and the
man who holds it.''

WHEN YOUR FIRM KEEPS MESSING UP THE PAYCHECKS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ILANA DEBARE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 Q:  I'm a recent college grad who just got a part-time sales job
with a well-known telecommunications firm that is launching a
wireless startup. I've now been with them 60 days, but the company
is still making errors on my paycheck. In the most recent instance,
I should have gotten a check for about $300 in salary and
commission but instead got just $18. The company eventually
corrects its errors, but needless to say, I am still insulted. Do I
have any recourse here?
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; A:  &LR; Drop your feelings of affront this instant! Sure, it's
awful to have your paychecks messed up. And you can't exactly tell
your landlord, ``Sorry, I'm not paying rent this month because my
company only paid me $18.''
</P>
<P>
   But you still shouldn't take it as a personal insult. This kind
of stuff happens all the time _ especially in startup ventures that
have to create policies and procedures from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The irony is that companies like this can find a way to bounce
our voices off a satellite, but they can't figure out how to pay
people correctly,'' said Richard Moran, a partner at Andersen
Consulting in San Francisco and author of a new book titled ``Fear
No Yellow Stickies,'' about how to navigate today's organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Your first step should be to double-check your firm's
sales-compensation rules. Companies sometimes have a policy of
delaying commissions for several weeks or months to be sure that
the sale goes through. If that's the case, this might not be a
mistake _ just the way business is done at your firm.
</P>
<P>
   If this truly was an error, you need to complain to the right
person _ someone in charge of issuing paychecks. That may be
someone in payroll or accounting. Or it may be someone outside the
company if your firm uses an outside contractor for payroll
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Ask your manager to help you find the right person, Moran
advises.
</P>
<P>
   And be persistent. It might take a while, but eventually, your
company will get it right.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q:  &LR; My company has been hiring new employees and giving them
more money than I get, despite the fact our ranks are the same and
that I've even trained some of the newcomers. This seems unfair. Is
it legal? I've e-mailed a complaint about this to my managers, but
they haven't done anything.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A:  &LR; Not only is this legal, it's pretty common these days _
especially in tight labor markets like Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Companies are desperate to hire skilled workers. And they're
willing to offer big bucks to get them, which means that they
sometimes end up paying newcomers more than longtime insiders.
</P>
<P>
   You're right to seek more money, but e-mail isn't the best way
to handle this _ or any other complaint.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't ever use e-mail for a negative communication,'' warns
Jack Chapman, the Wilmette, Ill., author of ``Negotiate Your
Salary: How to Make $1,000 a Minute.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time criticism is written down, it takes on a permanence
that you may not want. People's feelings can be hurt, or they may
feel backed into a corner.''
</P>
<P>
   Do some homework: Find out how much money people with your
skills are getting at other companies. One good source is the
JobSmart Web site, which offers dozens of salary surveys at
www.jobsmart.com.
</P>
<P>
   Then ask your boss for a face-to-face performance evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   Remind the boss of your accomplishments. Ask for input about
your work. Then _ if your supervisor thinks you're doing a good job
_ you can make a pitch to ratchet your salary up to the same level
as the newcomers.
</P>
<P>
   What if the boss says your work is great but still won't pay you
as much as your newly arrived peers?
</P>
<P>
   It may be time to get a raise by doing the same thing the
newcomers did _ finding a new job.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q:  &LR; The corporation I work for recently adopted an electronic
time clock for all hourly workers. In order to guarantee that
everyone is taking a lunch break, the clock has been programmed to
subtract a half an hour at the six-hour point in the employee's
day. This happens whether or not the employee actually takes a
lunch. Is this legal?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A:  &LR; No, it's not legal: Companies may not subtract pay for meal
breaks unless workers actually take those breaks.
</P>
<P>
   Your company may be doing this with the best of intentions,
trying to comply with the law by making sure that workers take time
off for lunch.
</P>
<P>
   California law says most nonexempt employees who put in more
than six hours must take a meal break _ even if they'd rather work
straight through lunch in order to leave the office a half-hour
earlier at the end of the day.
</P>
<P>
   This is one of those areas of the law that people violate all
the time without anyone being the worse. Who hasn't scarfed down
lunch at their desk in order to meet a deadline or leave early for
a 4:30 p.m. dental appointment?
</P>
<P>
   Still, the law is the law. And employers are legally responsible
for making sure their workers take meal breaks.
</P>
<P>
   But this is definitely not the right way to do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The right way is to tell people to take a meal break,'' said
Tom Grogan, assistant chief of the California Division of Labor
Standards Enforcement. ``If they don't take breaks, the company has
the option of starting a disciplinary process. But it can't just
withhold their pay.''
</P>
<P>
   Want to file a complaint? Call the Labor Commissioner at (415)
557-7878. But a better move, at least to start, would be to
politely notify your personnel department that this new meal-break
policy could get the company in some big legal trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Send your work and career questions to Ilana DeBare, Workways,
San Francisco Chronicle, 901 Mission St., San Francisco, Calif.
94103. Or send e-mail to workways &LR; sfgate.com. Or call (415)

many in print as we can.

<P>
   In historic Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem Sunday, Rev.
Calvin Butts III drew embarrassed titters from his congregation as
he urged the men and women in the pews who may be having
extramarital affairs to sidle up to their paramours on the sidewalk
after services, end the relationship and ask for forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we watch the president, we see each other, we see
ourselves,'' Butts told his congregation, to growing applause.
``Each one of us suffers from our own blemishes, our own envy, our
own backbiting, our own meanspiritedness. Have mercy, oh God.''
</P>
<P>
   In sermons explicit or indirect, in tones both angry and
mournful, members of the clergy across the country this weekend
struggled to offer their congregations some guideposts to make
sense of the presidential morality tale unfolding in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In a broad diversity of churches of many denominations,
conservative and liberal, large and small, ministers emphasized the
theme of forgiveness, saying no one is free of sin, and that only
God has the power to judge, to forgive and to redeem.
</P>
<P>
   ``God loves Bill Clinton,'' said Rev. Darrell Mount, pastor at
Trinity United Methodist Church in downtown Denver. ``And Hillary.
And Monica. And Chelsea. God loves each one of those persons caught
in this lost situation.''
</P>
<P>
   With a few exceptions, clergy members refrained from calling for
the impeachment or the resignation of President Clinton. Most
denounced the president for his adultery and for demeaning his
family, his office and the nation. But some ministers also
chastised the independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, for issuing a
sexually salacious report, the public for devouring it, news
organizations for circulating it and politicians who appear to be
rushing to judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pray for the moral discernment of the media that knows
sexual details can increase ratings,'' preached the Rev. Brenda
Stiers, executive minister of the Riverside Church in New York.
``We ask you to restrain us from having an immediate political
reaction and instead take us to the deep recesses of our hearts
where moral decisions are made.''
</P>
<P>
   This past weekend happened to fall at a time when both the
Christian and Jewish liturgies are focused on themes of repentance
and forgiveness. The Roman Catholic lectionary for Sunday took up
the story of the wayward Prodigal Son who spends his inheritance on
prostitutes, and yet is forgiven. Jews on Saturday night celebrated
the Selichot service, a midnight ceremony marking the beginning of
the High Holiday season of introspection, self-examination and
repentance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all familiar with the adage `the leopard can't change
his spots,''' said Rabbi Marc Schneier, president of the New York
Board of Rabbis, and rabbi at The Hampton Synagogue in Westhampton
Beach. ``Selichot brings the reassuring message that we can change.
We are not eternally guilty by past misconduct.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, a significant number of clergy members in many cities
said they had chosen to avoid the Clinton affair entirely in their
sermons. Even the pastors of some of the nation's largest
evangelical ``megachurches'' _ some known as centers of moral and
theological conservatism _ said they were intentionally steering
clear of the topic.
</P>
<P>
   At 16,000-member First African Methodist Episcopal Church in
South Central Los Angeles, the leadership of the church met about a
week ago and decided no longer to talk about the Clinton-Lewinsky
scandal from the pulpit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just felt like it had been addressed enough,'' said the
Rev. Jeanne Beharry. ``It's been discussed and overly discussed in
the newspaper, on television, every Bible study group. There has to
be a point where you say, `How much discussion is necessary?' and
if I had my druthers, I'd druther not discuss it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Gregory Boyle, a Jesuit priest with the Dolores Mission
Church in the Boyle Heights section of East Los Angeles, said,
``There are just too many life and death issues about which we must
preach, and so to preach about Bill Clinton and his situation is
not really relevant to the real issues of folks in a community like
this.'' To do so, Boyle said, would be to risk being labeled
irrelevant by the congregation.
</P>
<P>
   Even Cardinal John O'Connor, the Roman Catholic archbishop of
New York, said at St. Patrick's Cathedral Sunday that his silence
on the Clinton matter has caused ``perplexity and has provoked
others to question my courage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this to be the church's new approach?'' O'Connor said.
``That I point to people in the congregation and say, `I know your
sins, you shouldn't be here. Stand up.'''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor said, ``I have no intention of starting such
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did not appear for services at Foundry United Methodist
Church, which he usually attends while in Washington, avoiding both
the media camped on the church's steps and the pastor's sermon
about forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Forgiveness was not the chorus in every house of worship,
however. At the Presbyterian Church of Western Springs, Ill., a
bedroom community of Chicago, the Rev. David Bebb Jones, a
self-described political liberal and moral conservative, preached:
``The president ought to resign immediately. He has violated a
sacred trust, probably a constitutional trust, and surely the
people's trust. I can think of no other position in the country
where such behavior would not result in immediate dismissal,
including the ministry.''
</P>
<P>
   At Trinity Church in downtown Boston, about 150 members of the
Episcopal congregation turned out for an afternoon forum titled
``Immorality in High Places.''
</P>
<P>
   William Barnwell, an associate rector at Trinity, said of
Clinton, ``Even now he will be forgiven by God. Nevertheless,
grievous sin does have grievous consequences. President Clinton has
scarred the institution of the presidency, the Democratic party, of
which I am a proud member, and collective body of the American
people as well of course his own family and Monica Lewinsky. And
those scars will not go away whether he is impeached or not,
whether he resigns or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Intertwined with such chords of despair, some religious leaders
and their congregants said they sensed that Clinton's public
humiliation and confession could be the beginning of ``healing''
for himself, his family and other people wrestling with sin.
</P>
<P>
   As he left a forum on Clinton's transgressions Saturday night at
Wilshire Boulevard Temple in Los Angeles, Bill Steinberg, a temple
member, said, ``I think people are going to synagogues and churches
looking for something different than what they're getting from the
media, looking for forgiveness and looking for healing. I think
that's why people are here tonight. We dont want our nation torn
apart.''

ONLINE PAY-PER-VIEW OF STARR REPORT WOULD'VE MADE A BUNDLE 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARK VEVERKA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
We hear a lot about the unleashed potential of the Internet, but
who knew it would play such a significant role in altering our
perception of the presidency?
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Starr report in all of its graphic detail was available to
the masses almost immediately via the U.S. House of
Representatives' official Web site. Unfortunately, the document
wasn't exactly the Federalist Papers.
</P>
<P>
   What do you suppose James Madison or other framers of the
Constitution would have said about our electronic democracy in
action, not to mention Monica Lewinsky's account of our nation's
commander in chief in action?
</P>
<P>
   It's too bad Congress couldn't bolster our federal coffers by
charging for access to the site. Talk about your budget-deficit
busters. Given that sports, sex and financial news are the few
things capable of making money on the Web, the Starr report
qualified on two counts (the latter evident by the financial press'
obsession with the president's woes). I think that the federal Web
site would have been a major ``revenue enhancer'' as they say
inside the Beltway.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the bellwether Net stocks stayed on the sidelines
Friday while the broader market rebounded in response to the
independent counsel finally having made his case against the
president. Conventional wisdom is that some degree of uncertainty
had been lifted, giving investors renewed confidence in the market.
(Don't you love these rationalizations of short-term swings in the
market?)
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Net fans were not persuaded. Yahoo was flat,
closing at $79.88, while America Online slipped 88 cents to close
at $95. Meanwhile, K-Tel _ the poster child for wannabe electronic
commerce stocks _ saw its shares rise 25.5 percent to $8. Go
figure.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Weisel Watch '98:  &LR; The NationsBanc Montgomery Securities
Investment Conference, or ``28th Thom Weisel Memorial Investment
Conference,'' commences today at the Ritz Carlton in San Francisco
amid speculation about the future of the confab's chief steward,
Montgomery Securities founder Weisel.
</P>
<P>
   A week or so ago, Weisel was making noises about leaving the
firm after his contract agreement with NationsBank had been broken,
but Bloomberg News reported Friday that he was negotiating to stay
as long as severance payments were paid up front.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, the uncertainty surrounding Weisel and the
investment bank should make for inspired cocktail chatter. The
Montgomery chairman is scheduled to welcome investors today at
lunch along with former Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney. And no,
NationsBank Chairman Hugh McColl isn't slated to make an appearance
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate politics aside, NationsBanc Montgomery's research
director John Skeen is expecting an alert crowd of fund managers at
this year's conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, investors have demonstrated the ability to panic
for the first time since 1990,'' Skeen says. ``And the big concern
is banking exposure to emerging markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors fear that there will be more confessions from the
banks and brokerages in coming weeks regarding write-downs in
countries ranging from Russia to Brazil, he says.
</P>
<P>
   As far as tonics go for these uneasy times, Skeen is
recommending telephone company securities, of which several will
make presentations this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Data and video services are growing like weeds,'' Skeen says.
``(But) the big wild card for me is the banks.''

EDITORIAL: JUSTICE OR MERCY FOR CLINTON? 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Sept. 14:
</P>
<P>
   So, after one of the most tumultuous weekends in modern
political history, what is the future of the Clinton presidency?
There has been some public distress at Kenneth Starr's decision to
include explicit sexual descriptions in the independent counsel's
report to Congress. We are also seeing a broad congressional and
public repudiation of Clinton's preposterous contention that he did
not commit perjury in his sworn denials of a sexual relationship
with Monica Lewinsky. There have emerged the outlines of a deal in
which Congress might spring for censure rather than impeachment if
Clinton would admit perjury on this key point. Either way, it is a
virtual certainty that the House Judiciary Committee will hold
hearings on whether impeachment proceedings are necessary.
</P>
<P>
   But there are other elements that will only emerge over time.
One has to do with the public revulsion factor. The nation that
Clinton is supposed to lead, as chief executive and role model, has
not yet fully absorbed the Starr report. So far, the people seem to
be choosing political continuity at the price of having a president
whose word they cannot fully trust. The White House is hoping that
the 60 percent who approve Clinton's performance and favor censure
over resignation or impeachment will hold steady.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Clinton's legal team seems determined to inhibit the process
of forgiveness and acceptance. The most pressing issue before the
nation is not the propriety of Starr's descriptions of hallway sex
in the White House, but the propriety of the president's behavior
and his respect for the laws governing sworn testimony. David
Kendall's insistence Sunday that the president's interpretation of
questions concerning his sexual activities was in ``good faith and
correct'' is in no way supported by transcripts of that testimony.
Clinton would be well advised to remember the hospital wisecrack:
the operation was a success but the patient died. The
scorched-earth legalisms of Kendall and Charles Ruff have helped
create his crisis. His continued inability to break free of
lawyering that insults public intelligence makes him look like a
puppet and could cost him his one chance of political survival.
</P>
<P>
   It can be argued of course that, by withholding an admission of
his obvious perjury, the lawyers are retaining a hole card to be
played in a plea bargain with Congress. The president would admit
perjury in exchange for censure and for a shelving of the charges
of witness tampering and abuse of power. On Sunday, congressional
leaders as different as Sen. Orrin Hatch, the Republican chairman
of the Judiciary Committee, and Rep. David Bonior, the Democratic
whip, were offering what the latter called a ``middle option _ that
of a public rebuke for his personal behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   These men are acting responsibly in providing an escape route
from the constitutional crisis that Clinton has created through
adolescent recklessness and self-destructive lying. But he needs to
listen to advisers and lawyers who do not act as enablers in his
mad plan to stick to his Aug. 17 assertion that he was ``legally
accurate'' in his grand jury denial of sexual relations with Ms.
Lewinsky. ``The president is going to lose if they continue to do
that,'' said Sen. Bob Kerrey, another Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is that the president has to give the country
room for a pragmatic judgment that does not require a societal
endorsement of his pathology. After all, experience has taught that
to vote for Clinton, to work for him, to be his relative requires
throwing the normal rulebook of political decorum out the window.
The public may decide that is the pragmatic course in this case,
but such a choice should not rewrite acceptable standards of
conduct for future presidents. Voters and Congress are now in the
process of deciding whether it is better to tolerate the hobbled
leadership created by Clinton's sense of entitlement and
invulnerability than to interrupt the quadrennial rhythm of the
political process.
</P>
<P>
   For that to happen, Clinton needs to abandon his defiant
insistence on public acquiescence to his perjury. Only then can he
possibly escape the ultimate political disgrace. As for the
American people, if they choose the path of limited sanction, they
ought to do so with a vow of remembrance about the costs of
accepting a person who has presidential-scale vision but lacks
matching character, judgment and discretion. &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the president's lawyers arguing on Sunday that
even possible perjury by Clinton is not sufficient grounds for
impeachment, the country began a painful debate over the future of
his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The 445-page report to Congress by the independent counsel,
Kenneth Starr, was the talk at county fairs, in church pews, on
editorial pages and on television talk shows. And congressmen back
home with their constituents for the weekend, with less than two
months to go before election day, were listening closely.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews around the country, citizens continued to express
revulsion at the president's behavior but also their reluctance to
put the nation through the trauma of presidential resignation or
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington state, Dennis Pappas, a 55-year-old inventory
planner for the Boeing Co., summarized the president's behavior as
``wrong but not impeachable.'' Added his wife, Janice, ``Yes, its
between him and Hillary. I think the rest of us should get on and
get over it.''
</P>
<P>
   But in Poolesville, Md., Alex Viessmann, a retired Navy captain,
declared, ``I want him out of there. Just can't stand the man.''
</P>
<P>
   That conflict was apparent in the early polling. While
two-thirds of Americans believe Clinton does not share their moral
values, an identical number does not think he should resign from
office, according to a CBS News Poll released on Sunday. And while
Clinton's favorability ratings have slipped over the past several
days, he is still considerably more popular than Starr.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, ever sensitive to popular opinion, appeared to
be relying on those public views in intensifying the vigorous
defense of Clinton's actions and continuing the attacks on Starr.
</P>
<P>
   At least 25 newspapers have called for the the president's
resignation, including seven that circulate 250,000 or more papers
on Sundays, while others pondered weightily the historic impact of
the scandal. The president is ``morally unfit to continue in
office,'' declared The Albuquerque Tribune. The Detroit Free Press
argued that by stepping down, Clinton would be surrendering to
Starr and setting a dangerous precedent for future presidents.
</P>
<P>
   In houses of worship of all denominations, the clergy used the
week's events to emphasize the power of redemption and the healing
grace of God.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbis were preparing their congregations for the High Holy
Days; the Roman Catholic liturgy this week highlights the tale of
the Prodigal Son. Clinton skipped church on Sunday morning after
learning that his pastor, the Rev. J. Philip Wogaman of the Foundry
United Methodist Church in Washington, had made forgiveness the
subject of his sermon. Wogaman said in his homily that the Lewinsky
affair might be a blessing ``because it forced him to face up to
things.''
</P>
<P>
   The president did not want to make the congregation
uncomfortable by attending, an aide said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, said that
the evidence is ``overwhelming'' that Clinton lied to a grand jury.
He added that perjury could clearly be grounds to open an
impeachment inquiry. In an interview on the Fox network, Lott said
that Congress almost certainly would proceed with impeachment
hearings.
</P>
<P>
   He expressed hopes that the president ``will weigh very
carefully in his decisions from here on in the impact that all of
this has on his family, and on the presidency, and on the country,
the government, our image overseas. He needs to use judgment, which
he certainly didn't exercise when it comes to, when it came to the
sex matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether such considerations might lead Clinton to
voluntarily step down, Lott said, ``It could. I mean, I guess, you
know, that's a call only he can make.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott returned more forcefully to the theme later in the
interview, saying: ``I think he has got to come to terms with the
seriousness of this matter, and decide what he can do to help all
of us to get through it. That may mean that he needs to consider
the counsel of senior members of his party in the Congress about
whether or not he should resign or not.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House dispatched the top members of the president's
legal defense team to the airwaves on Sunday morning to rebut what
they called Starr's politically-motivated effort to humiliate the
president with a catalogue of titillating detail and a list of
spurious impeachment charges.
</P>
<P>
   In a significant shift in strategy, the president's lawyers said
that even if Clinton did commit perjury in a civil deposition in
January and again before a criminal grand jury in August, that
alone did not form sufficient grounds to begin impeachment
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever the president did or whatever the president said,
whether it was in January or August, there simply is no basis for
removing the president from office,'' said Charles F.C. Ruff, the
White House counsel, in the broadest defense of the president yet
heard.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   White House officials privately encouraged speculation that the
president would accept censure or some other form of reprimand from
Congress as preferable to a protracted impeachment inquiry, even if
it eventually cleared him.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff said that even if Clinton lied about his relationship with
Monica Lewinsky, a former White House intern, in his January
deposition in the Paula Jones lawsuit and in his August grand jury
testimony, he should not be impeached. In fact, Ruff asserted on
NBC's ``Meet the Press'' that perjury does not warrant the
initiation of impeachment hearings, nor does any of the other
presidential behavior so graphically described in Starr's report.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president of the United States, whatever he did _ and he
has misled the American people and he has engaged in wrongful
sexual conduct with Ms. Lewinsky _ what he didn't do is do anything
that warrants the beginning of the impeachment process,'' Ruff
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff said that lying under oath is ``clearly not'' grounds for
impeachment, a view repeated by David Kendall, the president's
private attorney, in a separate television interview.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's denial of a sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky
originally came in the Jones lawsuit, in which Mrs. Jones alleged
that the president made a crude advance while he was governor of
Arkansas and she was a low-level state employee. Mrs. Jones'
lawyers asked Clinton a series of questions about his relationship
with Ms. Lewinsky and the president repeatedly denied that he had
engaged in sexual relations with her under a detailed definition of
the term that includes touching of the breasts and genitals. Ms.
Lewinsky testified that their sexual encounters almost always
included such touching, as well as oral sex.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall said that the president ``absolutely'' sought to mislead
Ms. Jones' attorneys during the Jan. 17 deposition, but excused his
action as justified by the context.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was an arena in which his political enemies were out to
destroy him in a frivolous case that was then dismissed,'' Kendall
said. ``He did not perjure himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if he had, Kendall declared, ``No prosecutor from the
United States on the basis of this interchange would bring a
perjury prosecution.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House was also preparing to announce as early as
Monday the hiring of several new lawyers and political advisers to
augment the president's defense team. Among those being considered
for a top post on the White House damage-control squad is Gregory
Craig, a former aide to Sen. Edward Kennedy and currently the
director of policy planning at the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   Craig, a former law partner of Kendall's and longtime friend of
Hillary Rodham Clinton, said in a brief telephone interview on
Sunday that he was still weighing the White House offer.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As the White House pursued its defense strategy, there were
signs from Democrats both of continued slippage and of steadying
support for the president.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., has been one of the president's most
reliable allies throughout his travails, but over the weekend he
expressed anger at Clinton's parsimony with the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``He lies by being technically accurate. I wish he would stop
it,'' Frank said in an interview Saturday with a Fall River, Mass.,
radio station. ``He's not 14 anymore trying to outsmart the
principal.''
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview on Sunday, Frank said that he believed
Clinton would survive the current crisis, but as a president who
had been ``diminished politically and discredited personally.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in a quandary,'' said Rep. David Skaggs, D-Colo., who is
retiring after this term. ``Based on first read of all this I'm not
yet convinced we're talking about proper grounds for impeachment.
Yet I'm afraid there's been pretty severe damage done to the
effectiveness of the president's presidency.'' There was evidence
from New York, however, that Mr. Clinton continues to be a strong
draw for Democratic fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Grossman, the chairman of the Democratic National
Committee, said on Sunday that the party had logged what he termed
a ``sort of late-surge of support'' from contributors for a
fund-raising event in New York on Monday night that will feature
Clinton, Hillary Rodham Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and his
wife, Tipper. Grossman said the fund-raiser, which was originally
expected to raise around $3 million, now has commitments of over $4
million.
</P>
<P>
   Although some New York Democratic elected officials have said
they would not attend the event with Clinton _ citing prior
commitments, as opposed to wariness about being photographed with
him _ Grossman said that he had seen no signs of any of the party's
contributors backing off because of the president's difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are saying over and over again that this defining
moment and we want to stand with the president,'' Grossman said.
</P>
<P>
   The public, naturally, sees things differently from the lawyers
and politicians who dominate the Sunday chat shows.
</P>
<P>
   At the street fair in Poolesville, Md., Pat Michaels, a travel
agency executive, expressed a widespread feeling of exhaustion with
the months of lurid revelations and the political gridlock the
scandal has brought to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Spotting Rep. Constance Morella, a Republican whose
congressional district includes Poolesville, working the fair
crowd, he rushed to her side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to ask one thing,'' he said, frustration in his
voice. ``For God's sake, get us out of this mess.''
</P>
<P>
   As the nation debated the good, the bad and the tawdry in the
Clinton presidency, his top lawyer issued a categorical denial that
Clinton would ever leave office voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewed by NBC's Tim Russert on Sunday morning, Ruff was
asked if the president would consider resigning.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff: ``Absolutely not.''
</P>
<P>
   Russert: ``No way?''
</P>
<P>
   Ruff: ``Absolutely not.''
</P>
<P>
   Russert: ``Ever?''
</P>
<P>
   Ruff: ``Never.''

VALDES INCREASES VALUE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Don't tell Ismael Valdes the final two weeks are
meaningless. With a new general manager in town and his contract
about to expire, Valdes knows the best way to get on Kevin Malone's
good side.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes needs to show Malone that he is the pitcher who went
eight strong innings in Sunday's 10-inning 5-4 victory over the San
Diego Padres in front of 37,390 at Qualcomm Stadium, not the often
timid right-hander who has slipped the past two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand the situation,'' said Valdes, who has two starts
remaining. ``but I have the confidence to show everyone who I can
be.''
</P>
<P>
   You could say the effort should be discounted by the Padres'
second-string lineup, which played because of the hangover from
Saturday night's NL West-clinching victory. You could say he blew
two leads and allowed a two-run homer to light-hitting Andy Sheets
in the fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   But it's what Valdes did from there that could count most. He
showed a grit he rarely displays and something manager Glenn
Hoffman said has developed after returning from five weeks on the
disabled list (strained left side).
</P>
<P>
   That is the quality Valdes needs to show Malone now if he wants
to reap any benefits from salary arbitration this winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is something I have worked on very hard this year,'' said
Valdes, who threw 130 pitches. ``I've watched a guy like Chan Ho
(Park), who got a win (Thursday) when he didn't have his best stuff
and the other guy (Kevin Brown) was pitching so great. I wasn't
always able to do that. But you watch and you learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Although minor-league call-up Eric Weaver recorded his first
major-league victory after Bobby Bonilla's sacrifice fly scored
Trenidad Hubbard in the 10th, the focus was on Valdes.
</P>
<P>
   He is in the final season of a three-year, $4.3 million
contract. If he approached the 28 victories of his first two full
seasons in the past two years, Valdes could easily have become a $5
million-a-year pitcher. The Dodgers would have been happy to tie
him up long term rather than face the spiraling possibilities of
arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at the way he pitched when he fell behind 4-2,''
pitching coach Charlie Hough said. ``That's a spot where he could
have just given up. But he held the Padres right there and I look
at that as a very good sign.''
</P>
<P>
   Valdes fell behind in the fourth inning with one of the few bad
pitches he threw Sunday. It was a 2-0 fastball that Sheets drilled
into the left-field stands for a two-run homer. Suddenly, Valdes
was trailing Padres rookie right-hander Matt Clement, who was
making his first major-league start. Suddenly, Valdes had a choice.
He could be the pitcher who wouldn't come inside, wouldn't trust
his 93-mph fastball, wouldn't challenge hitters for much of the
past two years. Or he could be the pitcher who showed up Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers had given him a 2-0 lead, but the Padres tied it in
the second on three hits and a sacrifice fly by Ruben Rivera.
</P>
<P>
   Sheets made it 4-2, but Valdes stopped it there. He retired the
next nine batters. After a walk and an infield single, Valdes got a
double-play grounder to end the inning. He retired the first two
batters in the eighth, then allowed a single to former Angels
catcher Greg Myers. But Valdes hit 91 mph on his final pitch, a
fastball that caught George Arias for a called third strike.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes turned the game over to Weaver, called up Sept. 1 when
rosters were expanded. During the past two weeks, the Dodgers have
lost Antonio Osuna and Mark Guthrie to injuries. Hoffman couldn't
use rookie right-hander Mike Judd because tonight's scheduled
starter Carlos Perez injured his ankle before the game and might be
scratched.
</P>
<P>
   But Weaver got through the ninth and got a run when Hubbard
walked, Eric Karros doubled and Bonilla flied to left to score the
winning run. Jeff Shaw allowed a two-out single to John Vander Wal
in the 10th but held on to record his 43rd save.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our bullpen was in tough shape,'' said Hoffman, who could have
Guthrie (left elbow) back by the end of the week. ``That's why what
Rocket (Valdes) did was so big. It was the kind of game where he
might have come out after six. Instead, he gave us a big lift.''

TENNIS COLUMN: A RINGING TELEPHONE HERALDS A CHAMPION 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Mark McGwire (remember Mark McGwire?) hit his
62nd home run (it was only six days ago, but it seems longer),
somebody asked him if he ever went back to his room and looked at
himself in the mirror and shouted, ``Yessss!''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire is in touch with his feelings, as the saying goes, but
he was not admitting to that feeling of exultation. In fact, he
looked horrified at the suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   Another famous American slugger, however, will freely admit that
she went back to her hotel room on Saturday evening, looked at the
flashing red light on her telephone, and began to realize she
really had won the U.S. Open a few hours earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first call I got, and I'll never forget it, was from a guy
that plays on the tour, his name is Brian McPhie,'' Lindsay
Davenport recalled Sunday. ``He called and said it was 3:27 and I
just won match point and he called and was screaming in the phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are the ones you remember, the people that you play
with,'' Davenport added. `` I went through the whole list. You just
know a lot of people, friends of mine are very happy for me; it was
a great feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   There were 22 other messages on the machine, including one from
one Billie Jean King, who knows a thing or two about championships.
Davenport did not answer any of them, for which she was mildly
apologetic Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just being by myself for half an hour was really nice,''
Davenport said, ``just sitting down and relaxing and thinking about
it for a little bit. Realizing that I accomplished a goal. It's
really tough in life to set out and achieve your goals and I really
felt that I did that.''
</P>
<P>
   How does a new tennis champion celebrate the greatest moment in
her career? She goes out for dinner with 15 relatives and friends
at the Palm Restaurant in Manhattan, where more than one glass was
raised.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody kept asking, `Who won the U.S. Open?' and I kept
saying, `I did,''' Davenport said.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport had no problem sharing her satisfaction on Sunday, the
next day, the first full day of her life as an American-born
champion, the first since Chris Evert in 1982, and in a California
lineage with Tracy Austin and King.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought about myself in their company,'' Davenport
said. ``Maybe this sounds too modest, but I mean it. I'm not in
their company. If I win 10 or 11, maybe I'll feel that way.''
</P>
<P>
   One Grand Slam championship is quite enough at the moment for a
player who transformed her game and her physique in relative middle
age. Davenport, 22, is quite likely to touch a nerve in her home
country, because she seems so normal. She actually graduated from
high school, which on the tennis circuit is the equivalent of a
doctorate.
</P>
<P>
   She has always rushed back to California in her spare time, and
now she and her mother share a large home. And tennis fans have
watched her play through her sadness as her parents divorced after
raising their children.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, her joy was right up front as she returned to the
U.S. Open to play in the doubles final, in which she and Natasha
Zvereva lost to Martina Hingis _ whom she had beaten for the
singles title _ and Jana Novotna, 6-3, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   Then she was whisked off on a golf cart to a photo opportunity
in front of the Unisphere, the large globe in the center of
Flushing Meadows-Corona Park. The duties and the rewards of being
an American-born champion were just beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport took the long road to the title. She came along in the
wake of Steffi Graf and Monica Seles, and when they faltered, she
saw Hingis and Anna Kournikova and a whole slew of people named
Williams come racing along in their early and middle teens.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, it didn't make me mad,'' Davenport said. ``I think it's
good for tennis. The more good players there are, the better. Jana
has played the best tennis of her life in the last year. Arantxa
has worked hard. It's good for all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Novotna won Wimbledon this year, and Sanchez Vicario won the
French, and Hingis had already made her mark in the Grand Slams.
Davenport was usually seen as a diligent young woman who came up
through the American system but lacked the flair to break through.
She is also so nice that she would endure endless questions about
when she was going to get into shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a slow learner,'' she said on Sunday, riding the golf cart
out to the Unisphere. ``I would hear something in a press

would get it. But I'm not stupid, either. I mean, I read the
papers. I know what's going on.''

   Eventually, she spent more time with the jump rope, she watched
her diet, and she melted 25 pounds off her 6-foot-2-inch frame.
Then she won her national championship, and the bright lights
started flashing.

WOODSON DEFLATES JETS AND REVIVES A CAREER
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Success can be a powerful enemy. Success
can deceive the confident, tempt the bold, lead the brave into
traps.
</P>
<P>
   Last week in San Francisco, Glenn Foley, the Jets' brash young
quarterback, threw 58 passes and completed 30 _ 3 for touchdowns _
in an overtime loss to the 49ers. Most of the passes were quick out
routes to his favorite receivers, Keyshawn Johnson and Wayne
Chrebet, and to running backs. So there was no reason to suspect
that Foley would not keep going to the well Sunday against
Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   But there was one critical difference between the 49ers last
week and the Ravens on Sunday: Rod Woodson, Baltimore's left
cornerback. With two crushing interceptions, Woodson turned a game
around for his team and may have turned two seasons around as well.
His 60-yard touchdown run after intercepting Foley in the fourth
quarter clinched Baltimore's first victory and sent the Jets to a
second straight defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``He baits you; he guesses,'' Foley said of Woodson after the
loss. People talk about the wily veteran. Sunday, Foley, Chrebet
and Johnson discovered how demoralizing ``wily'' can be.
</P>
<P>
   Foley was driving the Jets for a tying score with nine minutes
to play when he went to his well one too many times. On
third-and-3, Foley wanted to sneak a back out of the backfield for
a cutesy low-risk pass. The Jets had run the route a couple of
times before, and Woodson laid off Chrebet, who lined up in the
slot. ``This time I said, `I'm going to jam the guy,''' Woodson
recalled. ``I got a good jam, he went outside, I looked over my
shoulder and saw the back coming out like he did before and saw
Foley looking right at him. I just dropped Chrebet, and he threw
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest, for the Jets, is demoralizing history. Woodson, who is
in his first season with Baltimore but his 12th in the league, went
in for the score, walking the last 10 yards backward. ``I wanted to
make sure there were no flags,'' he said. ``That's a long way to
run to have it called back.'' No flags. Just fallen Jets.
</P>
<P>
   Woodson had victimized Foley early in the third quarter _ again
with the Jets driving _ when he stepped in front of Johnson and
returned it 16 yards to the Jets' 49. Eight plays later, Baltimore
took a 17-7 lead on a field goal. Again, a case of going to the
well one too many times against the wrong defender.
</P>
<P>
   ``They ran that route a lot last week,'' Woodson said, although
they ran it a little differently this time. ``I knew what they were
going to run: they were going to run a China 7, have the tight end
block. I took about three steps and stopped. Foley threw it a
little inside; me and Keyshawn kind of fought over that one.
Luckily for me, I won that battle.''
</P>
<P>
   Before injuring a knee in 1995, Woodson was regarded as one of
the greatest defensive backs ever. He had made six Pro Bowl teams
and was elected to the National Football League's 75th anniversary
team. He came back at the end of the 1995 season _ the first NFL
player ever to tear an anterior cruciate ligament and return in the
same season. But the rapid return was the beginning of a two-year
slide, although he made the Pro Bowl team again in 1996. He left
Pittsburgh after that season, then spent 1997 in San Francisco. The
49ers released him after the season. Sunday's game may have been
the beginning of a resurrection.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last two years I haven't been playing that well,'' Woodson
said. ``I know that. I haven't been aggressive. My mind-set has
been kind of off the last two years for whatever reason. The year
after my surgery, I played OK, but not real well because I was
really beat up throughout the year. Last year, I was just never
comfortable, never had a feel for the defense in 'Frisco. I went
out there to get me a ring; it didn't work. So I came back to a
place where I'm comfortable, back in the AFC Central, back to a
defense I know, back to offenses I'm very familiar with. When
you're comfortable, you play better.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Jets lost a heartbreak game on the road. They
were competitive, though, and Jets fans, in typical underachieving
fashion, explained away the loss as a valiant effort against a good
team on the road. But Sunday's loss was a just a loss. Nothing
heroic. No valiant effort to crow about, nothing to build on. They
were stopped on the ground _ again _ and shut down in the air when
it mattered.
</P>
<P>
   They were defeated by a wily veteran. Woodson added what the
Jets already know. ``I'm back with the same intensity I had when I
was younger,'' he said. ``I'm more aggressive, anticipating, taking
chances. When you take chances, you make plays and get beat on
plays.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets are left to contemplate an 0-2 start and a ruined home
opener. Someone needs to energize the Jets the way Woodson has
energized Baltimore. No need for Jets fans to panic just yet,
though a bit of anxiety might be in order.

BRONCOS BREAK AIKMAN'S COLLARBONE, DEFEAT COWBOYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ On a day when the Dallas Cowboys' defense couldn't stop
the defending Super Bowl champion Denver Broncos, an injury to
quarterback Troy Aikman may have put a stop to their season.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman sustained a broken left collarbone on a scramble in the
second quarter of Sunday's 42-23 loss to the Broncos before 75,013
fans at Mile High Stadium and is expected to be out four to six
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate use the word use the word `devastating','' first-year
Cowboys coach Chan Gailey said. ``But it hurts our football team.''
</P>
<P>
   And after the Broncos' dominating offensive show _ which was
highlighted by a 191-yard effort from all-pro running back Terrell
Davis, including first-quarter touchdowns jaunts of 59 and 63 yards
_ the same could said of the Cowboys' defense.
</P>
<P>
   Though he played the lead role, Davis was not alone in hurting
the Cowboys, who had no answer for the Broncos passing game as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Denver quarterback John Elway kept a Cowboys defense aimed to
stop the run off balance by completing 16 of 22 passes for 268
yards and two touchdowns to tight end Shannon Sharpe, who caught
six passes for 98 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Even Broncos ``possession'' receiver Ed McCaffrey joined in a
515-yard offensive output with five catches for 117 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys defense tackle Chad Hennings compared the first-half
effort when the Broncos (2-0) scored touchdowns on five consecutive
drives and the Cowboys allowed 35 points, their most ever in one
half, to World War II's infamous invasion of Normandy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like Omaha Beach,'' said Hennings, a former Air Force
pilot and Gulf War veteran, of the 35-17 halftime deficit. ``We
were shellshocked. We weren't able to answer soon enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Hennings acknowledged that the defense, which entered the season
with concerns about stopping the run and putting pressure on the
passer, had its confidence shaken Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are down on one knee,'' Hennings said. ``But we are not out
for the count.''
</P>
<P>
   A dejected Gailey, who now must prepare the Cowboys (1-1) for
next Monday's crucial NFC East battle with the ground-oriented
Giants, was particularly disappointed in the Cowboys' run defense.
</P>
<P>
   With a pre-game goal of stopping the run first, Gailey said he
was surprised the Broncos ran well and so easily on his defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just overall, I was surprised they could move the ball like
that on our defense,'' Gailey said. ``I thought we'd stop the run
or stop the pass. I didn't think they could do both. But I thought
we'd stop the run, that's what we keyed on.''
</P>
<P>
   From the outset, it didn't look like the Cowboys keyed on
anything. The Broncos' first touchdown drive took advantage of the
Cowboys focusing on stopping Davis.
</P>
<P>
   On second down at the Cowboys 38, Elway set up in a shotgun
formation with five receivers spread wide against the Cowboys' base
defense. Sharpe ran undeterred down the middle and hauled in a
38-yard Elway touchdown pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had matchup problems, and they had a great game plan,''
Cowboys strong safety Darren Woodson said. ``I wasn't prepared to
see that. They spread us out. With our standard package in there,
we couldn't matchup.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys answered with a 36-yard touchdown strike from Aikman
to receiver Ernie Mills. But the defense never regained balance.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to stop the pass, the Cowboys were now at the mercy of
Davis and the Broncos' running game. Four plays into the ensuing
drive, Davis went around the left side and outran Cowboys
linebacker Dexter Coakley 59 yards to the end zone. Davis followed
with the 63-yard touchdown run on the Broncos' next play and
finished the first quarter with six carries and 138 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The final score and the loss of Aikman overshadowed a strong
performance by the Cowboys' offense, which appeared to be gaining
some continuity in Gailey's new system.
</P>
<P>
   Smith ran the ball well, gaining 93 yards on 20 carries and all
the receivers got into the act. Michael Irvin led the way with six
catches for 81 yards, but Billy Davis caught four balls and Mills
two, including the touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys also accentuated the positive, which included moving
the ball in the second half behind Garrett, who completed 14 of 19
passes for 113 yards.
</P>
<P>
   However, they said other players will have to step up for the
Cowboys to get through Aikman's absence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got other great players,'' Smith said. ``We just got to
pick up the slack. We've all got to step up and believe we can win
games.''

   (NYT10) NEW YORK -- Sept. 13, 1998 -- TEN-USOPEN-MEN, 9-13 --
Patrick Rafter, flying high and on his way to putting his signature
on the U.S. Open's trophy for the second consecutive year on
Sunday. Rafter committed just five unforced errors during the 6-3,
3-6, 6-2, 6-0 pasting of his fellow Australian, Mark Philippoussis,
that secured him a second career Grand Slam crown. (Chang W.

and Minyon Moore. (Paul Hosefros/New York Times Photo)

   (NYT8) MOSCOW -- Sept. 13, 1998 -- RUSSIA-CRISIS-ARTS, 9-13 -- A
cellist and a violist of the Seasons chamber orchestra in Moscow
going over a Tchaikovsky piece during a rehearsal break. The
group's concerts are often sold out, but low ticket prices mean
little income for members of the orchestra. Russia's artists have
never had it easy. With the ruble gyrating like a yo-yo, their
already difficult existence has become even more tenuous. (James

   (NYT6) DUNDALK, Ireland -- Sept. 13, 1998 -- NIRELAND-CHANGE,
9-13 -- Brian O'Neill, a store owner and former head of the chamber
of commerce in Dundalk. Dundalk, a town 13 miles from the border
with Northern Ireland once harbored so many Irish Republican Army
safe houses, underground weapons networks and gunmen on the run
that police called it ``El Paso.'' ``We are saying that this is not
a part of us. People who do these things do not represent our
community,'' says O'Neill of the acts of violence in Northern
Ireland. (Carlos Lopez-Barillas/New York Times Photo)

   (NYT5) WORCESTER, Mass. -- Sept. 13, 1998 --
CLINTON-MASSACHUSSETTS, 9-13 -- Rep. Jim McGovern, Democrat of
Massachussetts, talking with Judy Ellis at the Wrentham Town Common
on Saturday. Most Democratic candidates can't do enough to distance
themselves from President Clinton. But not Jim McGovern.
``Notwithstanding the fact that you can't pick up a newspaper and
not read about scandals, there's a lot more to the government than
scandal,'' says McGovern. (Rick Friedman/New York Times Photo)

<P>
   (NYT4) POOLESVILLE, Md. -- Sept. 13, 1998 -- CLINTON-MARYLAND,
9-13 -- Rep. Constance Morella, Republican of Maryland, seeking
votes for reelection to a seventh term, chatting with John Cooper,
a Cub Scout leader and a Democrat who voted for Clinton, at the
annual Poolesville street fair. Cooper opposes impeachment
proceedings. ``It's true that the country has been terribly hurt by
all this,'' says Cooper. ``What he's done is inexcusable, but it
isn't resignation or impeachable stuff. What I say is that, now
that it's all been aired, let's push on.'' (Justin Lane/New York

   (NYT3) ROCHESTER, N.Y. -- Sept. 13, 1998 -- FRONTIER-PROSPECTS,
9-13 -- Joseph Clayton, 48, chief executive of the Frontier
Corporation, has continued to push Frontier's lofty goals. But high
expectations are a staple these days at Frontier Corp., as the
company tries to evolve beyond its roots as a local phone monopoly.
In many ways, Frontier's evolution from clumsy striver to
turnaround prospect reflects the difficulties faced by old midsize
companies in an industry dominated by national titans and lean
niche operators. (Phil Matt/New York Times Photo)

<P>
   (NYT2) PROVO, Utah -- Sept. 13, 1998 -- NOVELL-MAJOR-PROFILE,
9-13 -- As chief scientist, Drew Major, 48, is the technological
soul of Novell Inc. One of the company's first three employees in
1982, Major, now the leader of the company's once-demoralized
engineering ranks, contends that Novell has found a way to once
again thrive in Microsoft's long shadow. ``We were a Microsoft
wannabe. But now, Novell understands that we have to be who we are,
and that is an independent maker of a specialized operating
system,'' says Major. (George Frey/New York Times Photo)

<P>
   (NYT1) NEW YORK -- Sept. 13, 1998 -- JEKYLL-HYDE-MANIA, 9-13 --
Pat Costa, a nurse from West Islip, N.Y., has seen the musical
``Jekyll and Hyde'' 70 times. Most people in the Broadway audience
each night are first-timers, of course. But, as the Deadheads of
Broadway, hard-core ``Jekkies'' have helped build word of mouth
that has made the show a phenomenon. ``We're normal people usually.
Maybe it's a case of arrested development. What I didn't do at 16,
I'm doing at 47,'' says Ms. Costa. (Barbara Alper/New York Times

EMMY'S GLAM GOES FOR THE SILVER, ENDS IN THE GRAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Will also move in the ``a'' national news file.) 
BY BARBARA DE WITT  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ On Emmy's golden anniversary, most of the stars
shined in silver.
</P>
<P>
   Silver gray, currently called trendy and almost always
unflattering, showed up in matte knits, shiny spandex and
bugle-beaded satin on numerous slaves to fashion. It looked best
against the pale skin and reddish blond hair of ``Star Trek:
Voyager's'' Jeri Ryan. A clingy Richard Tyler gown that dipped in
front and in back, it also featured an unusual keyhole design with
a train.
</P>
<P>
   Also looking awesome in spite of the color were Portia de Rossi
of ``Ally McBeal,'' who went for the sweater-girl look of a long
Valentino knit gown that had peekaboo designs down the sides; and
Jamie Lee Curtis, who wore a matte jersey knit number by Pamela
Dennis. It was so tight that Curtis said she hoped she'd be able to
hold in her stomach for the four-hour Emmy Awards show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frasier'' star Kelsey Grammer and his wife, Camille, also
tried gray and ended up looking like a couple of kids going to the
prom. He wore a gray silk tie with his tuxedo to match her Las
Vegas showgirl costume by Richard Tyler that was accented with
adorable Christian Dior silver satin pumps with pompons of silver
fox on the toes.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, Mary Tyler Moore fell victim to the gray phase. She wore
a Vera Wang gown that featured a sheer gray bodice and long sleeves
that made her look like a corpse, whispered several members of the
press stationed along the red carpet.
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, the majority of the stars paid no attention and went
for the glam of old Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Singer Apollonia looked like a nightclub torch singer from the
'30s in a caress of white satin by designer Richard Bowman that
bared her back and most of her backside. She was true to the
period, completing the look with white magnolias in her up-do.
</P>
<P>
   Julia Louis-Dreyfus of ``Seinfeld'' also went retro with a pink
satin gown and jeweled hairpins, while ``3rd Rock From the Sun''
star Kristen Johnston was the classic '50s starlet in a strapless
green satin gown with a diamond brooch at the back and a fishtail
hemline.
</P>
<P>
   Next in the dial-a-decade fashion parade were '60s fans Lisa
Nicole Carson of ``Ally McBeal,'' who wore a pale yellow gown by
Cynthia Rowley embroidered with huge hot-pink flowers; and Jenna
Elfman of ``Dharma &AMP; Greg,'' who wore a red crepe gown with red
high-heeled sandals and a red mini-tote. (She also made it a point
to tell the fashion police she was wearing underwear.)
</P>
<P>
   As the stars shouted the names of their designers, it was clear
that no-frills designers such as Armani and Calvin Klein were
taking a back seat this year, while more frivolous designers such
as Valentino, Christian Lacroix, Richard Tyler, Pamela Dennis and
the design duo of Badgley-Mischka were in the limelight. These
designers were big on body-glove dresses sprinkled with crystal
beads from the '20s and '30s, and they looked freshest on young
Hollywood. Especially on Brandy and Christina Applegate, whose
Badgley-Mischka beaded slip dresses were so similar that they
laughed and decided to pose together instead of having a cat fight
over it.
</P>
<P>
   Ballroom skirts were not in abundance this year, so when Helena
Bonham Carter swept in wearing a ruby red velvet gown by Christian
Lacroix, everybody looked. It was ditto with ``Dr. Quinn, Medicine
Woman'' star Jane Seymour, who was radiant in a Grace Kelly-esque
blue ball gown and matching stole by Escada.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from a few burgundy and dark green designs, the rest of
the crowd played it safe in black. Marie Osmond did it best with a
long knit suit by Donna Karan that had huge black feather trim at
the neckline and, as always, upstaged brother Donny, right down to
her Gucci stiletto pumps. &QL;

 &HT;    Emmys prove we'll watch anythingBy Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If only it had been four hours of stuff like this:
</P>
<P>
   ``This is for all the fat girls!'' a triumphant, plus-sized
Camryn Manheim shouted after winning an Emmy for best supporting
actress in the ABC drama ``The Practice.''
</P>
<P>
   There were bigger awards during Sunday night's Emmy telecast on
NBC. Helen Hunt, of NBC's ``Mad About You,'' followed her earlier
Oscar win with a third straight comedic actress Emmy (``I'm the
president of 'I was not expecting this,''' she said on a night when
it seemed no winner expected to win). Andre Braugher of NBC's
``Homicide: Life on the Street,'' finally won for best dramatic
actor for his final season on the show.
</P>
<P>
   In perhaps the night's biggest surprise, ``The Practice'' won
best drama. And in perhaps the night's biggest gimme, ``Frasier''
won its fifth straight best sitcom.
</P>
<P>
   But Manheim's outburst was the only moment genuinely exhuberant
enough to match the endless clips of memorable acceptance speeches
that helped fill out a very long and weird night.
</P>
<P>
   You want to know how peculiar the night was? This year's Oscar
show won the most Emmys _ five of 'em.
</P>
<P>
   To honor the 50 years of Emmys, the show lasted exactly 50
years. Or so it seemed. Even those who were a part of it kept
looking at their watches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only three hours and 33 minutes left,'' Jay Leno said when he
showed up early as a presenter in the four-hour telecast, mimicing
what viewers often say to themselves during the opening monologue
of his nightly, one-hour ``Tonight Show.''
</P>
<P>
   The hostless, often lifeless night was generously filled the way
cable networks generally fill their entire days: with reruns. These
were of series-ending scenes. Of great comedy. Of TV's 10 most
significant moments, which ranged from the Beatles 1964 appearance
on ``The Ed Sullivan Show'' to ABC's 1977 premiere of ``Roots.''
</P>
<P>
   But there were few live moments that matched anything frm the
archives. The highlights:
</P>
<P>
   _ Chris Rock, as a presenter, pulled a cigar from his tux and,
in a nod to recent events in Washington, said, ``Early on in
comedy, this was used as a prop.'' Pause. ``It still is.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Peter Tolan, who won with Garry Shandling for comedy writing
on HBO's ``The Larry Sanders Show'': ``I think it's great for our
industry, and for the country in 1998, that an award for comedy
writing can be won by a gentile.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Dennis Miller, on winning for variety show writing: ``I'd like
to thank the two men helped me get this job: Vernon Jordan...''
</P>
<P>
   _ Kario Salem, accepting writing the HBO TV movie ``Don King:
Only in America'': ``I was broke four years ago. I have to thank my
parents. They gave me the money to continue to write.''
</P>
<P>
   The night was summed up best by one of the ``regular people''
interviewed throughout the show about why they watched TV. It was a
soap opera addicted fireman from middle America.
</P>
<P>
   ``We watch anything,'' he said. ``No matter how stupid or how
crazy it is, we will watch anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Including, clearly, the Emmys.

GEORGE SHAPIRO, 78, COUNSEL TO GOVERNOR DEWEY OF NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ George M. Shapiro, who was counsel to Gov. Thomas
Dewey and a managing partner at the Proskauer Rose law firm in New
York, died on Tuesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 78.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a heart attack, said his wife, Rita.
</P>
<P>
   A Manhattan native, Shapiro graduated from Long Island
University and Columbia Law School in 1942. After service in the
Army Air Force in World War II, he became assistant counsel to
Dewey. He was promoted to counsel in 1951, a position he held until
the governor's term ended three years later.
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro joined Proskauer Rose Goetz &AMP; Mendelsohn (now Proskauer
Rose) in 1955, becoming a specialist in international law and
rising to become chairman of the firm's corporate department. Among
his clients was the French branch of the House of Rothschild.
</P>
<P>
   In 1966 Shapiro broke the stalemate in talks between New York
City and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey over how
much the city would receive in taxes from the proposed World Trade
Center, winning widespread praise for brokering the agreement that
lead to construction of the twin towers.
</P>
<P>
   Active in a number of philanthropic and public organizations, he
was a president of the Edmond de Rothschild Foundation, a trustee
of the Caesarea Foundation, a member of the Board of Visitors of
Columbia University Law School and the board of trustees of Long
Island University.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, he is survived by a daughter, Karen
Spector, of Charlotte, N.C., and three step-granddaughters. &QL;

IRVING E. SEGAL, INFLUENTIAL MATHEMATICIAN, IS DEAD AT 79
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By FORD BURKHART   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Irving E. Segal, an influential mathematician at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology who embraced many unpopular
notions, including the view that there was no Big Bang at the dawn
of the universe, died on Aug. 30 after he collapsed while walking
near his home in Lexington, Mass. He was 79.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cardiovascular disease, the university said.
</P>
<P>
   Segal parted company with almost all mainstream cosmologists in
his belief that the universe is not expanding and that the
astronomical phenomenon called red shift can be fully explained by
his own novel interpretation of principles of mathematical
symmetry.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Bang theory rests on observations that astronomers call
the ``red shift'' of stars. The light from a star moving away is
seen at a lower frequency, or more red. The red shift is often
compared to the Doppler effect in sound waves: the whistle of a
train is at a higher pitch when it is approaching, and shifts to a
lower pitch when it moves away.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers interpret the red shift as evidence of an expanding
universe. But Segal believed that the red shift could be better
explained by logic and theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``He believed there was a hidden symmetry in the universe,''
said Dr. Walter Strauss, professor of mathematics at Brown
University, who studied with Segal at MIT. ``These symmetries are
mostly invisible to the eye. But he believed you can see the
consequences of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Segal drew on his distinctive interpretation of the area of
mathematics called group theory _ and in particular one approach
known as the conformal group _ to fashion his argument against the
Big Bang. And there are those who allow that he may win the
argument one day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The possibility exists, although I would not bet my life on
it, that he may be right,'' said Dr. Bertram Kostant, a former
colleague at MIT.
</P>
<P>
   In Segal's research on mathematics, Kostant said, ``Irving often
found the tips of icebergs that others would develop.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in Segal's career, his work in quantum theory developed
a set of axioms that concisely expressed the theories of the
physicists Werner Heisenberg and Erwin Schrodinger and the
mathematician John von Neumann, Strauss said. Segal worked briefly
at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., with von
Neumann and a group of rising young stars in mathematics who left
their marks in a broad range of fields.
</P>
<P>
   Segal's initial impact was on functional analysis, a
sophisticated kind of calculus that involves algebra and sometimes
geometry, and on nonlinear waves, which do not have the traits of
linearity found in light and sound.
</P>
<P>
   Irving Ezra Segal was born in the Bronx, attended schools in
Trenton, N.J., and received a bachelor's degree from Princeton
University in 1937 and a doctorate from Yale in 1940, both in
mathematics. He then joined the Army and conducted ballistic
research at the Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   He worked at the Institute for Advanced Study from 1945 to 1948,
when he moved to the University of Chicago. In 1960, he joined MIT,
retiring in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   He won three Guggenheim Fellowships, in 1947, 1951 and 1967, and
received the prestigious Humboldt Award for research scientists in
1981. He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   His marriage to Osa MacLane ended in divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors include his wife, Martha; a daughter, Miriam, of
Lexington, Mass., and three children from his earlier marriage,
William, of Bethesda, Md.; Andrew, of Espanola, N.M., and Karen, of
Manhattan, and four grandchildren.

EDITORIAL: THE FACTS ABOUT AFFIRMATIVE ACTION
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Sept. 14:
</P>
<P>
   A new study of elite colleges provides striking confirmation of
the success of affirmative action in opening opportunities and
creating a whole generation of black professionals who are now
leaders in their fields and their communities. No study of this
magnitude has been attempted before. Its findings provide a strong
rationale for opposing current efforts to demolish race-sensitive
policies in colleges across the country.
</P>
<P>
   The study has been published as a book, ``The Shape of the
River'' by William Bowen, former president of Princeton University
and now president of the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, and Derek
Bok, the former president of Harvard University. It draws on data
compiled by the Mellon Foundation that closely tracked the academic
records, careers and attitudes of 30,000 students of all races who
entered 28 elite public and private colleges and universities in
1976 and 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The study looks at very selective colleges because it is
primarily at these institutions that race-sensitive admission
policies are an issue. ``Race sensitive'' means considering race as
one factor among many others, like grades, test scores,
extracurricular activities, where a student comes from and alumni
connections, in determining admissions. The analysis focuses mostly
on black-white comparisons because African-Americans have been at
the heart of the debate and because they provide a better data pool
than other minority groups.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence collected flatly refutes many of the misimpressions
of affirmative-action opponents. For example, black students who
were admitted to the most selective schools with SAT scores that
were lower than those of their white counterparts, instead of
becoming more discouraged by keener competition, had higher
graduation rates than blacks who had the same test scores but went
to less-competitive schools.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of spreading racial resentment, diversity-enhancing
policies were highly valued by both blacks and whites as being
important to their college experience and helpful in their jobs.
Even in academic majors, the stereotype of black students is wrong.
Less than 3 percent of blacks pursued a major in ethnic studies.
Blacks and whites majored in engineering and the hard sciences in
the same proportions. Still, the data also showed that black
students tended to earn lower grades than whites with the same SAT
scores and graduated at a lower rate, gaps that colleges still need
to address.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most impressive is how well the African-American
students performed after college. Instead of becoming demoralized
by the boost of affirmative action, they seized the educational
opportunities given. Forty percent of black graduates from the 1976
group obtained a professional or doctoral degree after college,
compared with 37 percent of white graduates. They were also more
active in community service and more likely to be leaders of civic
groups than white classmates 20 years later.
</P>
<P>
   The high achievement of these students is undeniable. For
opponents of race-conscious policies, ``merit'' always boils down
to test scores and grades. But as the data and the authors of this
study argue so eloquently, merit must also be defined in light of
an institution's mission. Taking race into account, as one factor
among many, has allowed these colleges to choose individuals of
high potential, enhance education for all students by creating
diversity on campus and fulfill a broader societal need by
educating a group of minority students who are becoming leaders in
every walk of life.

CAN SOWARD ZIP INTO HEISMAN RACE?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A Heisman Trophy campaign was expected to begin in
Los Angeles on Saturday, it just wasn't supposed to take place
inside the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   But USC wide receiver R. Jay Soward staked a claim to the
Heisman race when he tallied 256 total yards and scored three
touchdowns against San Diego State.
</P>
<P>
   Soward had a 53-yard touchdown reception, a 74-yard punt return
for a touchdown, a 42-yard run and an 8-yard touchdown reception.
He averaged 28.4 yards every time he touched the ball. So is it
time to start the Heisman talk?
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't object, but don't expect a lot of talk out of me
because last year the talk got me in trouble,'' Soward said.
</P>
<P>
   This is the new Soward, a balance between natural exuberance and
political correctness.
</P>
<P>
   ``No. No Heisman. I'm not thinking about it. If you guys want to
write about me, put me in the Heisman race. That's you guys,''
Soward said.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to dismiss Soward's impact after one game, but the
spark he provided USC in its 35-6 victory over the Aztecs was
beyond dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just the talent. It's the energy he creates,'' USC
coach Paul Hackett said. ``I'm so proud of him, of the way he
handled himself after being (suspended for one game).''
</P>
<P>
   If Soward is a one-man scoring machine, his effect on others is
also significant. Just ask quarterback Mike Van Raaphorst.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like this. They know we'll throw it deep with R. Jay, but
they still can't stop it,'' Van Raaphorst said. ``He's just too
fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Raaphorst also experienced a bit of redemption against San
Diego State, after his opening effort against Purdue was so closely
scrutinized.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I played a lot better and did what I expected of
myself,'' Van Raaphorst said.
</P>
<P>
   The sophomore quarterback admitted that he was distracted
against Purdue after experiencing food poisoning the night before
the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sick at 2 a.m.,'' Van Raaphorst said. ``It was something
I ate at the hotel.''
</P>
<P>
   The offense grabbed the headlines, but USC's defense has become
its trademark two games into the season. The Trojans have allowed
just six points in their past six quarters of football, and no
fourth quarter points in their past three games.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker David Gibson continues to make plays, with eight
tackles, three forced fumbles and three sacks. Middle linebacker
Chris Claiborne was everywhere, with 11 tackles and two sacks.
</P>
<P>
   But before getting too excited, it's worth noting USC has not
yet played a top-notch opponent. And the penalties _ including four
false starts in the first half _ were not encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   The offensive line remains suspect, and the defense has not yet
faced a physical, ball-control team. The kicking game will also be
under the microscope this week after Adam Abrams' 0-for-3
performance. Punter Mike MacGillivray also struggled, with a long
punt of 35 yards and averaged 32.8 yards per kick.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Center Eric Denmon was wearing an ankle boot after
suffering a high sprain and could be out for this week's game
against Oregon State. Tight end Antoine Harris suffered a minor
ankle sprain but said he would practice this week. Linebacker Mark
Cusano tweaked his already sore left ankle during a brief
appearance and could sit miss some practices this week.

UCLA'S DEFENSE HALFWAY TERRIFIC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UCLA coach Bob Toledo admitted he was anxious. Defensive
coordinator Nick Aliotti said he was clueless. Each spent last week
wondering how UCLA's young defense would perform in the season
opener against Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The answer was right in front of them all along.
</P>
<P>
   Each day for three weeks _ sometimes twice a day _ UCLA's
defense faced one of the nation's most potent offenses. What better
way to prepare a young unit than line it up against Cade McNown and
Co.?
</P>
<P>
   ``I really had no clue how we'd do,'' Aliotti said after the
Bruins defeated Texas 49-31 Saturday in the Rose Bowl. ``It's tough
(to get a feeling) when you're only going against yourself. But
it's been push-push against the offense and that's been
encouraging, because I think our offense is outstanding.''
</P>
<P>
   Compared to the concerns on defense, replacing tailback Skip
Hicks and receiver Jim McElroy were inconsequential.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins have two senior starters, linebacker Brendan
Ayanbadejo and safety Larry Atkins. They had a new coordinator,
Aliotti, who replaced the popular and unconventional Rocky Long.
And they had a new system, as Aliotti tossed Long's unique 3-3-5 in
favor of a traditional 3-4-4.
</P>
<P>
   The most experienced lineman, Pete Holland, is a junior with
seven career starts.
</P>
<P>
   The inside linebackers, Ramogi Huma and Tony White, are
first-time starters.
</P>
<P>
   The reserve inside linebackers, Cheyane Caldwell and Ryan Nece,
weren't inside linebackers last year.
</P>
<P>
   The free safeties, Eric Whitfield and Jason Stephens, instilled
so little confidence in training camp that Aliotti considered
moving Atkins, his best player, from strong safety to free.
</P>
<P>
   But the youngsters were in good hands. Toledo and Aliotti worked
together at Oregon, where Aliotti masterminded the ``Gang Green''
defense that produced a Pac-10 title in 1994. He was well-liked by
his players and well-respected by his peers. In 1995, he followed
Ducks head coach Rich Brooks to the St. Louis Rams, where he spent
three seasons as an assistant.
</P>
<P>
   When Long departed in December, Toledo wasted no time hiring
Aliotti, whose first cousin, Al Borges, is the Bruins' offensive
coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   The players took to Aliotti immediately _ ``He's phenomenal,''
Whitfield said _ and they slowly absorbed his system. It retained
the blitzing, swarming principles Long preached for two seasons but
changed the alignments and assignments.
</P>
<P>
   Aliotti's strategy against Texas was textbook: Stack the line
with eight players to contain All-American tailback Ricky Williams,
while daring quarterback Richard Walton to win it through the air.
Weak-armed and slow-footed, he could not. If the blitzers didn't
get him, the cornerbacks did.
</P>
<P>
   For 30 minutes, UCLA's defense was as stingy as it needs to be,
executing the game plan and holding the Longhorns to three points
and 116 yards. In the second half, with a four-touchdown lead, the
young Bruins became complacent and Aliotti inserted seldom-used
reserves like Steve Sua, Ali Abdul Azziz and DuVal Hicks. The
Longhorns took advantage with 28 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was extremely pleased with the way we played in the first
half,'' Aliotti said. ``I was disappointed in the second, though.
We had guys going in and out and we didn't keep up the intensity.
We felt the game was over before it was.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Bruins' rookie coordinator, it was the best of both
worlds: an impressive first half to secure the win, a disappointing
second half to assure he'll have something to teach this week.

MONDESI WON'T TALK THE WALK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Raul Mondesi walked as many times in the Dodgers'
four-game series (six) with San Diego as he did in the previous 2{
months.
</P>
<P>
   But if you think the free-swinging Mondesi finally is the
selective hitter the club is begging him to become, think again.
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth inning of Sunday's 10-inning, 5-4 victory over the
Padres, Mondesi came up after Eric Karros and Bobby Bonilla walked
on eight pitches. On the first pitch by San Diego rookie Matt
Clement, Mondesi flied out to left, and the rally sputtered.
</P>
<P>
   ``That hurt a lot,'' hitting instructor Mickey Hatcher said.
``He thought he got the perfect pitch. But pitchers know they can
throw stuff out of the strike zone because Mondy will swing.''
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi, who leads the team with 30 homers and 88 RBI, is
unrepentant. He has talked to teammate Gary Sheffield, former
hitting instructor Reggie Smith and now Hatcher about the
situation, but says there is only one solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm gonna keep swinging,'' he said. ``That is my game. That is
how I got here and how I put up good numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith tried to get Mondesi to become more selective by taking
pitches to right field. Mondesi came around after an early season
slump, but after Smith was fired in late June, Mondesi went back to
his old ways _ and then some.
</P>
<P>
   From June 30 to Aug. 11, he did not draw a base on balls.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a mechanical thing, this is a frame of mind,''
Hatcher said. ``A couple of times I've told him to just take the
first pitch regardless of where it is. When you watch Tony Gwynn,
you see him take the first pitch a lot. When the pitcher falls
behind, he comes in to the hitter. You know what kind of hitter
Tony Gwynn is. Mondy is different, more power, but he can learn
from that.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez injured: Carlos Perez, tonight's starter for the series
opener against Colorado at Dodger Stadium, turned an ankle during
batting practice and was taken for precautionary X-rays.
</P>
<P>
   If Perez, who has pitched back-to-back complete games, cannot
start, rookie right-hander Mike Judd will pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Quick hits: Jeff Shaw pitched the bottom of the 10th to record
his 43rd save, a career high. He had 42 last season in
Cincinnati.... Despite the loss, the Padres have been a great
extra-inning team (9-3). One of their more memorable victories came
against the Dodgers on June 17 when they won 3-2 in 12 innings
after a misplayed base hit by Roger Cedeno in center.

IN DEBATE, MCCAUGHEY ROSS CATCHES VALLONE OFF GUARD 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Betsy McCaughey Ross caught Peter Vallone off guard
Sunday in their final debate before Tuesday's Democratic primary
for governor, challenging his responses in a questionnaire on
abortion, answers that she said contradicted his public statements
on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   In the last five days, Ms. McCaughey ross, the lieutenant
governor, has taken to attacking Vallone, who leads in the polls,
and questioning his commitment to abortion rights. Sunday's
exchange was the closest that any of his rivals have come in six
televised debates to truly rattling Vallone, the New York City
council speaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't this your signature?'' Ms. McCaughey Ross demanded
repeatedly, waving the questionnaire, in which Vallone opposed any
law requiring parental consent for a minor to have an abortion. The
form was sent to candidates by the National Abortion and
Reproductive Rights Action League, or NARAL.
</P>
<P>
   Flustered, Vallone at first did not respond, then said he did
not recognize the form, adding, ``And that's not my signature.''
</P>
<P>
   But he acknowledged after the debate, which was televised live
from the WNBC studios at Rockefeller Center in Manhattan, that the
questionnaire had been filled out by his campaign and said that it
reflected his views. He insisted there was no contradiction with
his other statements on the issue, but the exchange exposed some
inconsistencies in Vallone's position as expressed by both him and
his aides.
</P>
<P>
   In the debate, which was moderated by Gabe Pressman, a senior
political reporter for WNBC, Vallone recovered well enough to
explain one of his differences with Ms. McCaughey Ross and turn it
into a challenge to her. He said he supported a law requiring that
before a minor can have an abortion, an adult close to her must be
notified.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe you're saying that if a 12-year-old becomes
pregnant, she should have the right to make that decision without
any adult notification,'' he said to the lieutenant governor, who
did not respond.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, Ms. McCaughey Ross said, ``You signed a form to
NARAL that said you opposed any limitations on a woman's right to
choose, regardless of her age.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there was no such wording on the questionnaire, but
Vallone refused to take the paper and check its language. ``I did
not say that,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   But the strongest defense of Vallone came from the other
candidates, Charles Hynes, the Brooklyn district attorney, and
James Larocca, a former state transportation commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me it's very offensive of you to take on Peter
Vallone on an issue that he's made very, very clear he supports
totally,'' Hynes said.
</P>
<P>
   As in previous debates, he and Larocca noted that Ms. McCaughey
Ross switched from the Republican Party just a year ago, and
accused her of altering her positions for political convenience.
And they accused her of violating a promise that all the candidates
made earlier this year not to attack each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I'm not going negative,'' Ms. McCaughey Ross said. ``I'm
here to seek the truth.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Vallone's aides said their aim for the debate was simply to have
their candidate avoid any embarrassing slips, and by that standard
he appeared to have succeeded. But the exchange on abortion exposed
some of the many fine, often semantic distinctions used by both
sides.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McCaughey Ross has framed her candidacy as an appeal to
women, and has questioned whether Vallone can be called
``pro-choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome of the primary on Tuesday, Ms. McCaughey
Ross is guaranteed to be a candidate in November's general election
because she has already been chosen as the Liberal Party nominee.
In the debate, Ms. McCaughey Ross reiterated her intention to
campaign on the Liberal line even if she loses the Democratic
primary. That drew attacks from the other contenders, who noted
that they had all promised Democratic Party leaders early this year
that they would not stand against the party's nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she wins the Democratic nomination for governor, I will not
support her,'' Larocca said, citing the lieutenant governor's
refusal to pledge that she will back the winner if she loses the
primary.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone's position on abortion does not differ markedly from
that of Gov. George Pataki, who is unopposed for the Republican
gubernatorial nomination. Vallone says he supports unrestricted
abortion rights for adult women, except late in pregnancy, when he
would allow it only if the woman's life or health were threatened.
That view is already reflected in state law.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McCaughey Ross says she will put no restrictions on
abortion. Her opponents charged Sunday that she contradicted that
stance in a 1992 article she wrote, but she insisted they were
misinterpreting the piece.
</P>
<P>
   Pressman began the debate with questions about Kenneth Starr's
report on President Clinton, a topic that for days has overshadowed
the candidates' efforts to make their cases.
</P>
<P>
   All four contenders expressed disappointment in Clinton's
conduct, and, with varying vigor, defended his presidency and
criticized Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone was the most muted, declining to say whether Clinton
should resign or be impeached, and suggested that Congress consider
censuring the president.
</P>
<P>
   It was Ms. McCaughey Ross who made the strongest statement,
saying that Clinton's behavior ``offends my moral values,'' but
calling on Congress to ``spare the nation the tumult of an
impeachment process.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These 11 charges do not constitute a threat to the welfare and
security of the nation,'' she said. ``Ken Starr's report is like an
edition of Playboy. It's time for the nation to move beyond this
crisis.''

EDITORIAL: A SICK TRADITION 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Sept. 14:
</P>
<P>
   The scene evokes an ugly memory for many New Yorkers, harkening
back to a dozen years ago when a black man was killed by a car
after whites in Howard Beach chased him into a roadway. Now, from a
community only a few miles away, comes raw videotape of the Broad
Channel Labor Day parade, where one float was titled ``Black to the
Future: 2098.'' On the truck bed were several white men in
blackface. One participant held onto the back of the truck in a
sickening parody of the murder of James Byrd Jr., who was dragged
to his death last June by white racists in Jasper, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Such ``humor'' is not new to the parade in this insular
community of Queens. A few years ago, participants dressed like
Hasidic Jews in a jungle-like setting for a float called ``Hasidic
Park,'' a take-off on ``Jurassic Park.'' There were other years
with parade entries mocking Asians and gay people _ some of them
awarded parade prizes for humor.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie O'Hare, a trustee of the volunteer fire and ambulance
corps that has traditionally sponsored the parade, issued an
apology and promised to screen parades for such offensive material
in the future. Several participants in the event have also
apologized, and some in the community wisely tried to make amends
Saturday as the Rev. Al Sharpton led a peaceful protest through
Broad Channel.
</P>
<P>
   At City Hall, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani responded swiftly. It was
an appropriate opportunity to reassure black New Yorkers, who often
perceive the mayor as hostile. Calling the parade a ``disgusting
display of racism,'' Giuliani demanded dismissal of city employees
who were involved. So far a police officer and two firefighters
have been suspended. The mayor's outrage is justified and his
instinct to be as tough as legally possible is sound, even though
dismissals might run into constitutional problems on free-speech
grounds.
</P>
<P>
   As for the residents of Broad Channel, this embarrassment can
offer a harsh but necessary lesson. Watching the videotapes of this
float on the nightly news _ seen not by a few neighbors but by the
whole multicultural city _should remind them how easily ethnic
humor turns mean.

SPORTS COLUMN: THERE IS NO THERE THERE FOR THE GIANTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND , Calif. _ You trot to the grocery store and there are
12 items you must buy. Got to have them all. You have $50. And the
first thing you toss in the basket costs $47.50.
</P>
<P>
   Not much room left for easy pickings.
</P>
<P>
   This is what happened to the Giants against the Raiders Sunday
at the Oakland Coliseum. Giants call tails at the coin flip. It is
heads. Raiders get the ball first. Kickoff goes through the end
zone. Raiders at their own 20. First play, SWOOSH! Running back
Napoleon Kaufman rips through the middle of the Giants' defense for
an 80-yard touchdown gallop. The game is only 17 seconds old and
the Giants are fighting an uphill battle on the road and in the
heat, down by 7-0.
</P>
<P>
   There went $47.50 in one swipe.
</P>
<P>
   That set the table for the Giants' 20-17 loss.
</P>
<P>
   Try as hard as they might _ and the Giants showed resolve in a
game that featured two ties and one Giants lead _ the feeling was
evident in the first quarter that the Giants were not going to
completely overcome Kaufman's run. That it would haunt them
throughout this game. And it did.
</P>
<P>
   Funny, but the Giants entered the game wanting to make sure that
the Raiders' Jeff George did not beat them with his arm by throwing
long balls all day to his fleet core of receivers. The Raiders'
longest passes of the day were 49, 27 and 26 yards. No gigantic
bombs. It was the legs of Kaufman. That was the early dagger.
</P>
<P>
   He caught the Giants in a defensive look called ``Bear.''
</P>
<P>
   For Kaufman, it proved sweeter than honey.
</P>
<P>
   ``We called a Bear defense, like everyone was coming, and then
we backed off and tried to fool them,'' Giants linebacker Jessie
Armstead said. ``He ran it and cut back. It was a good play and a
good call for them against that defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Giants defensive back Shaun Williams said: ``Any time a back
goes 80 yards on the opening play, that sets a bad tone. He put our
backs against the wall. I just saw him make a nice cut and a couple
of moves, and then he was gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Giants linebacker Marcus Buckley added: ``We just opened a can
of worms. The way we played that and on some of our third-down
play, we set it up where teams are going to come after us and
challenge us in the same ways until we stop it. Everyone knows he
is the type of runner that if he hits daylight at full speed that
you are not going to catch him. And on the first play? It wasn't
good.''
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders absolutely loved it. The Giants got tangled in their
own web on the play and fell over each other. Tim Brown, the
Raiders' big-play receiver who had a 22-yard touchdown grab and
made big third-down catches the rest of the day, said that the
Raiders felt tremendous confidence after Kaufman's run. That the
day, regardless of ups and downs, simply might the theirs.
</P>
<P>
   ``And for the Giants,'' Brown said, ``we saw where coach Fassel
said that the one thing he didn't want to happen was give up big
plays. So, we start the game with the biggest of plays, 80 yards
for a touchdown. That does not bode too well for their team on the
scoreboard or in their minds. They had to be thinking, `We've
already done the one thing coach didn't want us to do.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants made 15 penalties. The Raiders made 16. Some of it
was comical _ jumping offside, late hits, simply a pure lack of
discipline. The Giants were concerned about not giving up big
plays, but they certainly did not make any, either. The Giants
averaged a measly 4.5 yards gained per pass play. Their longest
completion was for 20 yards.
</P>
<P>
   They got a fumble recovery at the Raiders' 15 with 2 minutes 24
seconds left in the third quarter and did not take one shot into
the end zone. Short stuff that went backward. They settled for a
field goal and a 17-17 tie. That, too, would haunt them.
</P>
<P>
   What kept the game from being brutal to watch was hard hitting
on defense and big third-down conversions by the Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   They made eight of 18, and one of them was a fourth-quarter,
third-and-26 pass of 26 yards to tight end Rickey Dudley. That
changed the game of field position, because the Giants stopped
them, got a punt to their own 6, punted themselves to their own 49,
and then the Raiders took over from there and scored the winning
field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Oh yeah. During that game-winning drive, the Raiders made a
third-and-10 pass to Desmond Howard at the Giants' 13. It was
Howard's only reception of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody in our defense wasn't exactly on the same page
today,'' Buckley said. ``I don't know why. We let this game slip
out of our hands in certain spots.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting with the start.

GEORGE WALLACE DIES AT 79

   Former Gov. George C. Wallace of Alabama, who built his
political career on segregation and spent a tormented retirement
arguing that he was not a racist in his heart, died Sunday night at
Jackson Hospital in Montgomery. He was 79 and lived in Montgomery,
Ala.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace had been in declining health since being shot in his
1972 presidential campaign by a 21-year-old drifter named Arthur
Bremer.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace, a Democrat who was a longtime champion of states'
rights, dominated his own state for almost a generation. But his
wish was to be remembered as a man who might have been president
and whose campaigns for that office in 1968, 1972 and 1976
established political trends that have dominated American politics
for the last quarter of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1972 race, he was running strongly in the Democratic
presidential primaries. He rattled the party's establishment with a
second-place finish in Wisconsin and a rapid ascent in the polls.
He also won primaries in Maryland and Michigan on May 16, but got
the news in a hospital bed, having been shot and paralyzed on the
day before the balloting.
</P>
<P>
   The injury from Bremer's bullet became a ``thorn in my flesh,''
Wallace later said, and the truncated campaign became a thorn in
his psyche. He died believing that had he not been shot, popular
appeal would have forced the Democratic Party to put him on the
ticket in 1972 to keep Nixon from sweeping the Sun Belt and
blue-collar enclaves in the Middle West and Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   He believed that his underdog campaigns made it possible for two
other Southerners, Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton, to be taken
seriously as presidential candidates. He also argued ceaselessly
that his theme of middle-class empowerment was borrowed by Richard
M. Nixon in 1968 and then grabbed by another Californian, Ronald
Reagan, as the spine of his triumphant populist conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews later in his life, Wallace was always less keen to
talk about his other major role in Southern history. After being
elected to his first term as governor in 1962, he became the foil
for the huge protests that the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. used
to destroy segregation in public accommodations in 1963 and to
secure voting rights for blacks in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace was the first major political figure in his generation
to exploit the antipathy toward Washington that went on to be a
prime force in politics from coast to coast.
</P>
<P>
   He was also surely the first in his generation to galvanize the
white, working-class voters later labeled as Reagan Democrats. And
he was the first nationally known politician of that generation to
put such raucous emphasis on race, crime, welfare and other issues
that still loom large, if less crudely, on the political landscape.
