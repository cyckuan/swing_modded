<HEADLINE> China to Continue support for Macao's Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, September 29 (Xinhua) -- A top Chinese official in Macao
said that China will adopt various measures to help Macao maintain
sustained economic growth and development.
</P>
<P>
Wang Qiren, director of the Xinhua News Agency Macao Branch,
told reporters with the Beijing-based "China Today" magazine in a
recent interview that China will, as it has always done, pay great
attention to and back the economic growth of Macao.
</P>
<P>
Macao's economic growth slowed down over the past few years due
to a fiercer international competition and other factors. The
Chinese government is making studies and taking some measures for
the revival of Macao's economy, Wang noted.
</P>
<P>
"China is studying for ways of cooperation between enterprises
of the mainland and those in Macao on the basis of 'one country,
two systems', to support the reorientation of Macao's enterprises
toward production of technology- and capital-intensive products,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Chinese Government supports the Macao
authorities in the expansion of tourism industry, and makes
suggestions on the improvement of its investment environment. The
establishment of a Sino-Portuguese major infrastructure facilities
coordination body is also under negotiation.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that Macao will maintain its own economic
characteristics after China resumes exercise of sovereignty over
Macao in 1999. It will continue to be a free port and an
independent tariff zone, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Macao will become a showcase and a bridge linking China and
the international market," he said. "China will continue to
maintain the economic prosperity and development of Macao after
1999."

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Changes in Strength Lead to Taliban's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The remarkable victory won
by the Afghan Taliban Militia recently was mainly based on the
increasing power of the Taliban and the weaker defense of the then
Kabul government.
</P>
<P>
The Afghan scenario has been totally changed by the Taliban's
capture of the capital of Kabul and three eastern provinces in an
incredible short period of 16 days in September.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here attributed the speedy victory to the changes in
strength of the two rivals-- the Taliban and the then Kabul
regime.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban had attacked Kabul twice last year but both were
repulsed by the Afghan government troops loyal to President
Burhanuddin Rabbani.
</P>
<P>
However, the Kabul defense has been weakened since June this
year when Rabbani and one of his arch rival Gulbuddin Hekmatyar,
the leader of Hezb-i-Islami, reached a reconciliation and set up a
new coalition government.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to woo Hekmatyar, Rabbani conceded the position of
Defense Minister to Hekmatyar's man, which was disagreed by Ahmad
Shah Masood, Rabbani's top military commander.
</P>
<P>
The differences on the appointment of Defense Minister and some
other issues made rifts among the new coalition government troops,
weakening the unified command and morale of the army.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Hezb-i-Islami forces have a low combat
effectiveness, and their positions were often seized by the
Taliban easily in recent battles, which led to the collapse of the
whole defense lines.
</P>
<P>
So, the actual military strength of the coalition army was
weaker than the previous government troops despite the increase in
the number of soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Taliban's strength had increased though they did
not launch any major offensives in Afghanistan in the first eight
months of this year to show that.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban has controlled half of the Afghan territory since
last September, which was believed to be enough for them to absorb
new blood for its body.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban took a series of measures to consolidate its rule
in the areas under their control and helped many Afghan people who
had been fed up with the bloodshed lead a stable life.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban introduced strict Islamic rule in its territory,
imposing severe penalties on thieves, robbers, drug traffickers
and users, collecting arms and ammunition from private hands.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban also raised the slogan "wiping out warlords and
reconstructing the country" which won tremendous support from the
Afghan people who had suffered a lot in the civil war.
</P>
<P>
Many small local forces joined the Taliban or surrendered as
soon as the Taliban entered the areas under their control.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the military equipment of the Taliban forces were
upgraded and increased. A large number of tanks and armored
vehicles of the Taliban were seen in the battles for capturing
eastern provinces and the capital of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the upgrading of the communication facilities
improved the coordination among the Taliban forces in recent
fighting.
</P>
<P>
The morale of the Taliban forces was also high enough to ensure
the waves of attacks on the enemies' positions.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the flexible military strategy and tactics
helped the Taliban a lot in their recent offensives.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban shifted its major striking forces from the
front-line south of Kabul which was defended by Masood's men to
the relatively-weak eastern provinces early this month.
</P>
<P>
After capturing Nangarhar, Laghman and Kunar provinces and
Jalalabad, the biggest city in eastern Afghanistan, the Taliban
cut off the major supply line to Kabul from the east.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban also cut off the power supply for Kabul after
seizing Sarobi, Hekmatyar's major stronghold which is located 75
kilometers east of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
In the suburbs of Kabul, even Masood's soldiers could not
resist the Taliban which had controlled the whole military
situation after a series of victories.

<HEADLINE> Greece's Lost Children Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 29 (Xinhua) -- A total of 375 Greek children
illegally adopted in the 1960s and 1970s have been reunited with
their natural families in the past two years, according to a
report published in today's Athens daily Ta Nea (The News).
</P>
<P>
The most recent reunions took place last week in Athens when
Americans Andreas Freedman and Jane Bernstein traveled from the
U.S. to meet their Greek parents and siblings. Both had searched
for their families for a long time and had known of their adoption
since their childhood.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources who have been helping adopted children
find their roots in Greece, about 10,000 babies were illegally
adopted in the 1960s and 1970s through the Agios Sylianos
Orphanage in the northern Greek town of Salonika and other
institutions. It is believed that 225 of them now live in Salonika
and other parts of Macedonia, 20 have been located in Patras and
120 in Athens.
</P>
<P>
A large number of children were given for adoption to American
families, many of Jewish descent.
</P>
<P>
About 70 percent of adults who have been reunited with their
families are women. Men appear to have less interest in finding
their roots.

<HEADLINE> UN Inspector Arrives in Iraq for Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Charles Duelfer, deputy
chairman of the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) on disarming
Iraq, arrived here today for talks with Iraqi officials on Iraq's
past arms programs.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after his arrival, Duelfer told reporters that the
talks on the programs have been the "focus of our work for the
past several months, now it is a normal discussion."
</P>
<P>
He said that the UNSCOM will present a report on Iraq's past
weapons programs to the Security Council in early October and his
"routine" visit this time is to complete discussions with Iraqi
officials before that.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the former Swedish diplomat Rolf Ekeus,
chairman of the UNSCOM will come to Baghdad later in October.
</P>
<P>
On a question on the areas his talks will cover in Baghdad, he
said "just a range of activities, it is an overall discussion on
the relationship between the UNSCOM and the government of Iraq."
</P>
<P>
The UNSCOM deputy chief is expected to hold talks with Iraqi
Oil Minister Amir Mohammed Rashid who leads Iraqi side in talks
with UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
The crippling economic sanctions imposed by U.N. on Iraq to
punish its 1990 invasion of Kuwait have been in place for six
years now.
</P>
<P>
Under U.N. resolutions, Iraq must obtain a bill of
clearance on its weapons of mass destruction before the sanctions
could be removed. Iraq has unilaterally declared that it
has fulfilled obligations toward U.N. resolutions and demands a
total lifting of U.N. embargo.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe May Join Proposed All-Africa Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe, which has earned
world recognition for its peace-keeping efforts in strife-torn
African countries, is expected to agree to a new United States
plan to create an all-African force, the Zimbabwe National News
Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The southern African country currently has troops in Angola,
where a fragile peace is holding after a bitter 19 year civil
war, and has also provided troops to keep law and order in
Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Analysts expect Zimbabwe's contribution to the proposed
10,000-member force would be substantial, given its experience in
dealing with civil war.
</P>
<P>
The African crisis response force would be sent to countries,
such as Burundi and Rwanda, where civil strife has resulted in
the death or displacement of millions of people.
</P>
<P>
US Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Goerge
Moose was in Zimbabwse last week meeting Zimbabwe's defence
chiefs to discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
Moose has been seeking support for the force from such African
countries as Botswana, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mozambique, Senegal,
Tanzania and Uganda. enditem

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Parliament Calls for Emergency Meeting on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi National Assembly
(parliament) has called for an urgent and exceptional meeting of
the Arab Parliamentary Union to take a unified stance toward
Palestinian-Israeli conflict in the occupied territories, the
Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported today.
</P>
<P>
In a telegram to Speaker of the Palestinian National Council
Selim al-Za'noun, Iraqi parliament Speaker Saadoun Hammadi renewed
Iraqi parliament's stand in support of the Palestinian people's
defense of legitimate rights, sanctities and dignities, INA said
</P>
<P>
Hammadi said that the Palestinian struggle against Israel
reflects the Arab nations' rejection of "humiliation at the hands
of Israel and the United States."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the only response to Israeli "usurpation" of
land is armed struggle and all forms of pressure that "exhaust
Israel's human and material potential."
</P>
<P>
INA pointed out that the Iraqi cabinet has denounced the
position of the U.S. which seeks to block condemnation by the
Security Council and the international community of violations and
atrocities perpetrated by Israel against Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet meeting presided by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
Saturday stressed the need to reconsider all erratic policies that
have encouraged Israel to persist in humiliating Arabs and to
"commit more crimes against them" in defiance of public opinion
and in flagrant violation of international charters and norms, INA
noted.
</P>
<P>
The recent armed conflict between Palestinian people and the
Israeli forces erupted following Israel's decision to open an
archaeological tunnel near the Al-Aqsa Mosque, the third holiest
Islamic shrine in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The conflict has brought about a high number of casualties on
both sides and caused grave concern in the international
communities.

ways of enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of the tax
departments.

"The Commonwealth member countries have the same taxation
systems because they are former British colonies and the problems
we encounter are similar. So we need to exchange ideas on new

<HEADLINE> Arab League Calls for Action to Contain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The Cairo-based Arab League
today urged the five permanent Security Council member states to
take swift action to prevent the explosion of the grave situation
in the Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
Israel today reopened the tunnel near Al Aqsa Mosque in
Jerusalem after it had been temporarily closed for Sabbath.
</P>
<P>
The opening of the tunnel Tuesday triggered clashes between the
Palestinians and the Israeli troops, which have reportedly left
nearly 70 people dead and over 1,000 Palestinians injured.
</P>
<P>
The situation in the Palestinian territories remain unstable
though Palestinian police have begun trying to stop Palestinian
youths from holding demonstrations and clashing with Israeli
troops.
</P>
<P>
Messages by Arab League Secretary General Esmat Abdul-Meguid
have been sent to the foreign ministries of the United States,
Russia, China, Britain and France, calling for steps to contain
the tension between Israel and the Palestinians, Egypt's Middle
East News Agency (MENA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Similar messages have also been sent to Ireland, which holds
the current presidency of the European Union, Colombia in its
capacity as the current president of the Non-Aligned Movement and
the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
The messages affirm the necessity of swift action based on the
official pledges made by the current Israeli government to halt
the measures that have sparked Palestinian fury and implement the
signed agreements, MENA said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. President Bill Clinton invited Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
to meet in Washington Tuesday to defuse the present crisis between
the Palestinians and Israel, according to media reports.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also invited Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and King
Hussein of Jordan to attend the summit.
</P>
<P>
Faisal al-Husseini, the Palestinian official in charge of the
Jerusalem affairs, said today that a tripartite, a four-way or
five-way meeting attended by Arafat, Netanyahu and other parties
concerned is expected to be held.
</P>
<P>
But he expressed hope that the meeting would be held in Cairo.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 29 (Xinhua) -- A pessimistic secretary of
state said today that the peace process in the Middle East is in
jeopardy as a result of violence resulting from the Israelis
opening a tunnel near the Islamic holy site.
</P>
<P>
"The peace process is in no doubt jeopardy," Warren Christopher
said on NBC television's program "Meet the Press." "This is
probably the worst threat it has had with 55 or more killings and
hundreds and perhaps thousands injured."
</P>
<P>
"It is urgent that the parties get back together," he said.
</P>
<P>
Before Christopher's interview was aired, President Bill
Clinton announced at the White House this morning that he has
invited Middle East leaders to Washington for a summit in an
effort to salvage the faltering peace process.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and King Hussein of Jordan have accepted the
invitations, but Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak who also was
invited has not said whether he will come.
</P>
<P>
They are expected to fly to Washington late Monday.
</P>
<P>
Christopher said there could hardly a breakthrough in the
upcoming summit.
</P>
<P>
"We shouldn't expect miracles out of this," he told NBC "Meet
the Press."

PARIS, September 29 (Xinhua) -- France today expressed its
regret over the absence of Europe, especially of France, from the
forthcoming Middle East summit to be held in Washington Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette said in a televised
interview that the absence of Europe is "certainly regrettable"
and "is not a positive element."
</P>
<P>
France said Saturday that it was ready to mediate between
Israel and Palestinians at a meeting likely to be hosted by
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government announced today that Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat will go
to Washington for a summit meeting Tuesday. Jordan's King Hussein
is also expected to join the summit.
</P>
<P>
France could feel betrayed by the secret arrangement of such a
meeting among the United States, Israel, Palestinians and Jordan,
as Paris has been actively presenting itself as an important
mediator between Israel and Palestinians.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Despite the tensions
between Israel and the Palestinians, the West Bank and Gaza Strip
were comparatively quiet today, with a few reported incidents of
stone-throwing.
</P>
<P>
In Jerusalem's Old City, Palestinian youngsters threw stones
today at the Israeli police guarding the disputed Western Wall
tunnel, which was reopened this morning, slightly injuring one
Israeli policeman in the arm.
</P>
<P>
The tunnel, which triggered off last week's violent
confrontations between Israel and the Palestinians which left over
60 dead and hundreds of others wounded, had been temporarily
closed during the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Over 1,000 Palestinians from the Bethlehem area held a
peaceful march to protest against Israeli policies from the Church
of Nativity toward Rachel's Tomb at the entrance of the West Bank
town, which was under the Israeli army's control.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian police barred the protesters who chanted slogans
against the Israeli government from approaching the Israeli
checkpoint between Bethlehem and Jerusalem, in an effort to avoid
further confrontations.
</P>
<P>
Some stone-throwing incidents were reported in some villages
in the Nablus area in the West Bank, as most part of the city
witnessed peaceful marches organized by the local Palestinian
authorities.
</P>
<P>
However, classes in the city's Al-Najah University and other
schools were suspended for the second consecutive day by the
administrations of the city and the university.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Ramallah, where the fiercest fighting between
Israeli army and the Palestinian police took place last week,
Palestinian officials participated and delivered speeches at a
peaceful rally.
</P>
<P>
There were reported clashes between Israeli soldiers and
Palestinian residents in Qalandya camp outside Ramallah despite a
curfew was imposed on the area by the Israeli army, and one
Palestinian youth was injured.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army also raided the Silwad village in the
Ramallah area to quell demonstrations, injuring two
Palestinians. A curfew was imposed on the village and its
neighboring village of Hizma.
</P>
<P>
Tulkarem, Kalkilya and Jenin, three other
Palestinian-controlled West Bank towns, today also observed
peaceful marches, and the Palestinian police in the areas barred
any friction between the demonstrators and Israeli soldiers.

<HEADLINE> Dublin Drug Protesters Demand Action Against Dealers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Anti-drug activists in Ireland
have vowed to continue staging marches through Dublin, the
capital, until the government and the anti-drug authorities meet
their demands for a new response to the drugs crisis.
</P>
<P>
About 3,000 people marched through the city-center Saturday,
calling for more treatment facilities for drug addicts and greater
efforts by the government to tackle dealers, said a report
reaching here from Dublin today.
</P>
<P>
The march was organized by the Coalition of Communities Against
Drugs (COCAD). And marchers came from all parts of the city as
well as other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
It was the largest anti-drug demonstration in the capital since
the l980s. The COCAD said that more marches throughout the city
were planned for next week.
</P>
<P>
The marchers included a Sinn Fein councillor, Christy Burke,
and the Independent TD, Tony Gregory. Gregory was asked if he was
concerned about the possible development of vigilantism, he said,
"I'm concerned about the number of young people that have died of
heroin in Dublin over the years. That's my principal concern."
</P>
<P>
At the Department of Justice, Ronnie Byrne, one of the march
organizers, invited Minister for Justice Nora Owen to visit a drug
market "without the police clearing the way in front of her" so
that she could see the extent of drug-dealing there.
</P>
<P>
Cecil Johnson, from Killinarden, said that the true statistics
of addiction in Dublin had not yet emerged. "There're not 7,000
addicts; there're 20,000 addicts," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hugh McGowan, from Clondalkin, said that there was a drug
epidemic which had already damaged one generation and was now
threatening the next. "We must be the fire-break in the middle; we
must fight the fire and stop it going across," he said.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Minister Expects Israel to Make </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Nabil Shaath, Palestinian
Minister of Planning and International Cooperation, predicted
today that the peace process, now in jeopardy, can be put back on
track, but it will depend on the Israeli government, reported
Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Shaath, a key Palestinian negotiator with the former Israeli
government, told the radio that Palestinian-Israeli relations are
not at a critical junction stemming from bloody clashes last week.
</P>
<P>
"We have two roads ahead. One is the road for peace which
requires commitment to implementation of what we have so far
achieved, and to continuation of negotiations in the future. This
road is what we of course would like very much to see," Shaath
said.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted, the new Israeli government has absolutely
obstructed and destroyed it, using the time wasted to further
settlements and encroachments upon the Arab part of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
But, he said, "We still have an opportunity to have a meeting
between the (Israeli) prime minister and President (Yasser) Arafat
with the participation of the presidents of the U.S., Egypt and so
on to proceed to implementation of the peace agreements."
</P>
<P>
Shaath said that the second road is to return to the old days
for Israel to show what he called "arrogance of power."
</P>
<P>
Israel is powerful having tanks, helicopters and guns, he said,
but adding that hardware could not make peace.
</P>
<P>
Shaath expressed his profound disappointment about the fact
that the current Israeli government has done nothing that the
previous Labor government committed to.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on a point made by Netanyahu that Israel had given
weapons to the 30,000-strong Palestinian police and, contrary to
Israel's expectations, they used the guns to shoot at Israeli
soldiers, Shaath said in an interview with CNN later that Israel
provided the weapons in accordance with the Oslo agreement, but
without bullets.
</P>
<P>
Talking about violations of the peace agreement, he asked
that under the agreement Israel was supposed to have withdrawn
from Hebron by March, but why it is still refusing to implement
it?

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Insists on Summit Without Preconditions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu insisted today that the Washington summit on
the Middle East peace process should be held without any
preconditions.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the ABC television "This Week" program, Netanyahu
said, "In fact, that was my only precondition, that we all come
without preconditions."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu accepted U.S. President Bill Clinton's invitation to
attend the summit in Washington early this week when the president
telephoned him today, and he "expressed his appreciation for the
president's attempts to help move the peace process forward,"
Netanyahu's spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Asked if he would keep open a disputed tunnel near Jerusalem's
al-Aqsa Mosque, which triggered violence over the last week,
Netanyahu said, "I think it's not an issue. For me the crucial
issue is how to engage the peace process."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu denied that the direct factor of the violence, which
has claimed an about 70 death toll, is the opening of the tunnel.
"The Palestinian authority used a fabricated description of what
this tunnel is about to spark off organized demonstrations," he
said.

AMMAN, September 29 (Xinhua) -- King Hussein of Jordan today
accepted an invitation from U.S. President Bill Clinton to attend
a quadripartite summit in Washington later this week.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-sponsored summit, which will draw together Palestinian

Netanyahu, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and King Hussein, is
aimed at discussing the stalled and endangered peace process and
exploring ways to renew and revive the peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The summit will also focus on the situation in Jerusalem and
the conflict between Palestinians and Israel forces, which was
triggered off by Israeli government's decision to open a
controversial tunnel along the Al Aqsa Mosque compound in Arab
East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The clashes have killed more than 60 Palestinians and injured
hundreds of others in the past few days. 14 Israelis were also
dead during the violence.

<HEADLINE> Terrorist Actions by Albanian Separatists in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The executive board of the
ruling Socialist Party of Serbia in Polje city in Yugoslavia's
southern province Kosovo today strongly condemned the latest
terrorist actions in some Kosovo towns.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the press, the executive board said the
latest terrorist actions against local police in the towns of
Podujevo, Vucitrn, and Srbica, all in Kosovo, were conducted by
members of the Greater Albanian Separatist Movement, an illegal
organization of Kosovo Albanians who has been struggling for
independence from Yugoslavia for decades.
</P>
<P>
Local reports in Belgrade today said that a group of unknown
attackers carried out a series of synchronized terrorist attacks
at 21:00 Friday (local time) on Serbian police and the Yugoslav
army in the above-mentioned three towns. They fired shots and
hurled explosive devices, causing substantial material damage but
without casualties.
</P>
<P>
State organs, primarily the police, "must find out the
terrorists once and for all and be more efficient in maintaining
law and order in the territory of Kosovo," the executive board
statement said.
</P>
<P>
It said the latest terrorist actions were a direct attack on
the opening of positive processes in settling certain issues in
Kosovo, such as the agreement between Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic and Ibrahim Rugova on a normalization of the
Albanian-language school system signed early this month.
</P>
<P>
A strong separatist movement has been active in Kosovot for
decades. The separatists proclaimed a so-called Republic of Kosovo
and their objective is to separate the province with a majority
population of the ethnic Albanian minority from Serbia and the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Seven persons were killed in terrorist attacks in Kosovo from
April through July 1996. Six of these victims were Serbs,
including three policemen.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Says Washington Summit Has No Clear Goal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak does not see there is a clear goal of the Washington
summit and that is why he has yet to decide whether to attend the
meeting on the Middle East peace process, Egyptian Foreign
Minister Amr Moussa said today.
</P>
<P>
Moussa told CBS television's "Face the Nation" program that it
was not just a question of Mubarak's presence, but the policy of
the summit -- "What exactly are the goals of the meeting and what
are the results."
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton announced this morning that he has
invited Middle East leaders to Washington to attend a summit in a
effort to salvage the faltering Middle East peace process, which
in effect has collapsed as a result of the Israelis opening a
controversial tunnel near Jerusalem's al-Aqsa Mosque, one of
Islam's holiest sites, which touched off protests from the
Palestinians leading to violence over the last week.
</P>
<P>
Moussa, who described the peace process as "fragile and
teetering," indicated that Egypt required Israel's commitment to
implement previous agreements before Mubarak could consider the
possibility of attending the Washington summit.
</P>
<P>
"We call on the U.S. to continue to ensure that the peace
process is back and this can't be ensured without a clear
commitment by Netanyahu that he will heed all the agreements and
implement all the documents," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt will continue to support the peace process and do
whatever work we can to bring it back on track, provided Netanyahu
is ready to heed the peace process and the principles of peace
process as have been agreed."
</P>
<P>
Reports from Gaza said Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, on
receiving Clinton's telephone today inviting him to attend the
Washington summit with Netanyahu, withheld his agreement for that
invitation.
</P>
<P>
"Arafat insisted on the participation of Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak," Arafat' aide said. "Clinton and Arafat agreed to
continue contacts with Mubarak to convince him to attend. Arafat
will leave for Cairo tomorrow for this purpose."

<HEADLINE> Avramovic to Head Opposition Coalition's Election Lists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Dragoslav Avramovic, former
Yugoslav national bank governor, will head all election lists of
the opposition coalition, coalition representatives told a press
conference today.
</P>
<P>
Five opposition parties in Yugoslavia -- the Serbian Renewal
Movement, the Democratic Party, the Civic Alliance of Serbia, the
Democratic Party of Serbia and the Association of Serbia's
Independent Unions have formed the coalition, which will
participate in the November 3 elections.
</P>
<P>
Avramovic said at a press conference today that the coalition
had offered him to become Yugoslav prime minister if it won the
elections. Avramovic was sacked as the central bank governor last
July due to his disagreement over some economic policies with
government officials.
</P>
<P>
He said the coalition was aimed at reforming the economic,
social and political relations in the country and setting up a
government which would be based on an economic program he worked
out when he was in the governor's office.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, leaders of the coalition parties called for
political changes in the country, because they were a basis for
economic and social changes.
</P>
<P>
They said the coalition's party club at the Yugoslav parliament
would act together and that its members would not have the right
to enter other party alliances individually.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Socialist Party of Serbia, the Yugoslav United Left
and the New Democracy Party also formed a coalition Saturday. It
called on other parties to join their coalition ahead of the
November general elections.

<HEADLINE> Deniyev Nominated for Chechen Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Adam-Shamala Deniyev, a
powerful figure but relatively unknown in political circles, has
been nominated as candidate for the premiership of the future
coalition government in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Deniyev's name will be put forward when talks, expected soon,
between Moscow and the separatists on the formation of an interim
government in the region, are in the offing.
</P>
<P>
The nominee, who had not been in the political limelight until
now, "has more weight and wields more hidden levers of control in
Chechnya than (Chechen separatist leader Zelimkhan) Yandarbiyev
and (Chechen separatist military chief Aslan) Maskahdov put
together," say reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Deniyev "has wonderful ties with the Middle East and Turkey,"
they added.
</P>
<P>
Deniyev, who was named over the weekend by the Congress of
Public and Political Organizations of the Chechen republic, now
heads the public and political organization, "The Government of
Salvation of the Chechen People."
</P>
<P>
He was born in the village of Avtury, Shali district of
Chechnya. He also coordinates the activity of the public and
political parties and movements of the entire North Caucasus
region.
</P>
<P>
His chances of becoming head of the future coalition government
were described as "quite serious" by one of the ministers of the
Moscow-backed Chechen government, headed by Doku Zavgayev.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, Deniyev, who had been in "a
political shadow" until now, was a powerful figure recognized by
influential forces in Chechnya and beyond.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin met
with national security chief Alexander Lebed on further Chechen
settlement talks.
</P>
<P>
Sources said Lebed briefed Chernomyrdin on his preparations for
the upcoming visit by Chechen separatist leader Zelimkhan
Yandarbiyev to Moscow, scheduled for late this week.
</P>
<P>
If everything went as expected, Chernomyrdin and Yandarbiyev
would meet to confirm the principles of forming the Chechen
provisional coalition government, its composition and the
relationship between Moscow and Chechnya.

<HEADLINE> Three Gorges Project in Progress  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Construction of the Three
Gorges Project, the world's largest hydro-electric undertaking,
has been progressing smoothly with some items slightly ahead of
schedule.
</P>
<P>
The Yangtze River, the longest in China and the third longest
in the world, will be dammed in November next year as scheduled,
said Yuan Guolin, vice president of the China Yangtze River Three
Gorges Development Corporation.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges Project will be 2,335 meters long and 185 m
high. It will create a huge reservoir of 1,045 sq. km, one sixth
of the size of the Aswan Reservoir in Egypt. It will have a water
storage capacity of 39.3 billion cubic m.
</P>
<P>
It is meant for flood prevention in the middle and lower
reaches of the Yangtze with huge economic benefits in power
generation, navigation and water supply among others.
</P>
<P>
The project will raise the Yangtze Valley flood preventing
capacity from a ten-year frequency at present to a hundred-year
frequency.
</P>
<P>
Elevated water level will enormously improve navigation in the
upper Yangtze, allowing 10,000-ton fleets of towboats to sail to
Chongqing, the largest city in southwest China.
</P>
<P>
The power station, the world's largest, will have 26
turbogenerators with a combined installed capacity of 18,200 mw
and an annual power output of 84.7 billion kwh. The clean energy
thus created each year is equivalent to 50 million tons of raw
coal.
</P>
<P>
The project will be built in three stages in 17 years. A
diversion channel is scheduled for completion next
April. Construction of the permanent shiplock began last March and
is scheduled for completion in 2003. The Three Gorges Airport and
an expressway will be open to traffic before October this
year.
</P>
<P>
International bidding for 14 of the turbogenerators has started.

<P>
Based on the price of May 1993, static investment in the
project is 90.09 billion yuan, which includes 50.09 billion yuan
for the project itself and 40 billion yuan for the relocation of
residents in the project area.
</P>
<P>
According to the schedule, the project will start to generate
electricity by 2003 and, by the end of 2005, it will no longer be
necessary for the project owner to borrow money.
</P>
<P>
While the funds mainly come from domestic sources, the country
is considering possibilities of utilizing foreign funds in
the form of export credit, commercial loans and bond issues.
</P>
<P>
Foreign financial institutions have also shown interest in the
project. Senior officials of Merril Llynch, Morgan Stanley and
Sumitomo Bank have visited the site and expressed their
willingness to cooperate with the Chinese in building the project.
</P>
<P>
The government plans to establish an ecology and environment
monitoring network to keep an eye on changes that might be brought
about by the Three Gorges project and has allocated 90 million
yuan for its establishment.
</P>
<P>
Under a massive scheme, China will tighten control of
pollution, establish a supervisory system on the eco-environment,
build an extensive forest belt in the middle and upper reaches of
the Yangtze, and develop ecological agriculture, said Guo Shuyan,
deputy director of the Three Gorges Project Construction
Commission.
</P>
<P>
As the first step, the government will close down all small
paper-mills in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River before the
year 2009.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing City, a major source of pollution for the Yangtze, is
building a waste water treatment plant with a daily processing
capacity of 48,000 tons in cooperation with Denmark.
</P>
<P>
The government is pushing ahead with a technical renovation
campaign to update processing technologies and recycling standards
in factories discharging waste water along the Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
To reduce soil erosion, 2.86 million ha of land along the
middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze will be planted with trees
within five years. The Central Government alone will earmark 450
million yuan for the plan.
</P>
<P>
Close attention will also be paid to protecting aquatic animals
in the region.

cooperation, and that between enterprises and colleges are being
conducted on an experimental basis.
</P>
<P>
These practices of reform were designed to adjust educational
structure and arrangement, and relieve the shortage of expenditure
in higher education. Reformers also expected to save educational
resources from being wasted in terms of the central government and
local governments running similar colleges in the same places.
</P>
<P>
The turmoil of the 10-year "Cultural Revolution" (1966-1976)
left China with a shortage of talents. China, which is now
marching toward the next century, has to be confronted with this
stark reality.
</P>
<P>
The main solution to the problem for the country to take is to
train as many professionals as possible through its colleges and
universities while attracting overseas scholars to serve the
country at home.
</P>
<P>
The number of college students on campuses has continued to
rise. According to China's medium-long term plan for educational
development, there will be around 9.5 million students in colleges
and universities receiving higher education by the year 2010. The
number is currently only 2.9 million.

Addressing the opening ceremony, an environment official said
the marine reserve, together with two existing marine parks in the
northeast of the New Territory, brings Hong Kong into a new era of
marine conservation.
</P>
<P>
Secretary for Planning, Environment and Lands Bowen Leung said
the marine parks and reserve, though a new concept introduced to
Hong Kong in the early 1990s, have shown their research and
educational potential.
</P>
<P>
Cape D'Aguilar is a place full of special marine creatures,
according to Leung. In a coral rock pool there 12 species of
corals have been found, with one indigenous to the area. A rare
species of marine eel grass has been discovered at the Yan Chau
Tong Marine Park.
</P>
<P>
The official said continuous efforts will be made to select new

Commerce, Inc.
</P>
<P>
Meeting Wicwood K.T. Chong, Li, who is also chairman of the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), said the achievements made in China's reform
and opening drive in recent years cannot be separated from the
efforts of Hong Kong and Macao compatriots.
</P>
<P>
To some extent, it is because of their contacts overseas that
many articles of everyday use made in the Chinese interior areas
are accessible to the world market. Therefore, Hong Kong has
played an irreplaceable role in the economic development of the
interior, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li noted that it is in the interests of Hong Kong compatriots
and is also the need of the reform and opening-up and the economic
construction of the interior areas to implement the "one country,
two systems" principle, and maintain Hong Kong's long-term
stability and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
He said the "one country, two systems" principle will never
change, and Hong Kong's prospects will be in better position after
its return.
</P>
<P>
In another meeting with a group from the Pilipino-Chinese
General Chamber of Commerce, Inc., Li extended a welcome to the
group members, who are in China to attend the National Day
celebrations, wishing them a happy life in China.
</P>
<P>
He also voiced his hope that the guests will contribute more to
the economic development of China and the friendship between China
and the Philippines.
</P>

Wang Zhaoguo, vice-chairman of the CPPCC National Committee,
and head of the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central
Committee, and some officials from the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs

<P>
BEIJING, September 30 (Xinhua) -- In an editorial to be
published tomorrow, China's National Day, the People's Daily calls
on the entire Chinese people to create the national spirit to
score still greater successes.
</P>
<P>
The People's Daily, the leading newspaper in China, describes
Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics as the "powerful ideological pillar" for
invigorating the Chinese nation, and the nucleus and pillar of the
Chinese nation's spirit.
</P>
<P>
According to the editorial, guided by Deng's theory, while
advancing cultural progress and material progress, the Chinese
people of various ethnic groups are jointly creating the vigorous
national spirit with characteristics of the times and the Chinese
nation.
</P>
<P>
To stand on its own in the forest of nations in the world, to
score tremendous achievements, and make great contributions to
human progress, a country must have its national spirit, which
"embodies national interests, reflects the national will, complies
with the historical trend, and has an enormous appeal."
</P>
<P>
It adds that the spirit should be capable of tapping the
potential of the whole nation, and mobilize the strength of the
entire nation to form an invincible force and create a
world-shaking undertaking.
</P>
<P>
The most inspiring part of the national spirit is patriotism,
it says, adding: "In the spirit of patriotism, we can surmount all
kinds of difficulties to win victory."

<HEADLINE> Three Militants Sentenced to Death in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's Higher Emergency State
Security Court today sentenced to death three Moslem militants
involved in terrorist operations in Qena governorate and its
surrounding areas in southern Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The three were identified as Anwar Hamed Abbas, Ahmed Abdel
Wahab and Ahmed Khalil, Egypt's new agency MENA reported.
</P>
<P>
The court ruled that the verdict be read out on October 31
after obtaining the approval of the mufti, the highest Islamic
clergy.
</P>
<P>
Under Egyptian law, the sentence should be endorsed by the
mufti before it is carried out.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has fiercely cracked down on Islamic fundamentalist
militants who have waged a violent campaign against the government
since 1992 in an attempt to install strict Islamic rule in the
country.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday night, suspected Moslem militants shot and killed a
farmer in the town of Abu Qarqas near Minya, some 260 kilometers
south of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
MENA said that a number of assailants opened fire with automatic
rifles at Samir Munir Nuseif, who was working on his field, adding
that the attackers escaped.
</P>
<P>
MENA quoted police sources as saying that Nuseif was a
Christian Copt and the militants may have suspected he was a police
informer.

<HEADLINE> UAE Denounces Israeli Repressive Actions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates
(UAE) today denounced the repressive actions of Israeli troops
against residents of the occupied Palestinian territories,
reaffirming its solidarity with the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
This came at a weekly meeting of the UAE Council of Ministers
chaired by Deputy Prime Minister Sheikh Sultan Bin Zayed al-Nahyan.
</P>
<P>
The Council of Ministers discussed the bloody conflicts between
Israeli soldiers and Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip
after the Israeli government opened a tunnel near the site of Al
Aqsa Mosque in East Jerusalem. At least 70 people were killed in
the clashes during the past few days.
</P>
<P>
The council condemned Israel's recurrent violations of Islamic
sanctuaries in the occupied territories, terming them a flagrant
defiance of the sentiments of Arabs and Moslems all over the world.
</P>
<P>
It called on the international community to shoulder its
responsibility for maintaining Islamic sanctuaries in the
occupied Palestinian territories, including Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The council held the Israeli government responsible for all
the consequences of failing to implement the peace agreements
singed by Israel and the PLO.
</P>
<P>
It called on the Israeli government to resume the peace
negotiations in accordance with the foundations on which the peace
process is based, emphasizing that establishing a fair and
overall peace is the only way to realize security and stability

<HEADLINE> China's Progress in Higher Education Reform (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Higher education in China,
long been influenced by the country's planned economy, is being
re-vitalized through systematic reforms.
</P>
<P>
China has reformed the systems of school running, management,
investment, tuition fee charging and job assignment during the
past few years.
</P>
<P>
An official at the State Education Commission said that a
framework is being formed during the reform process, under which
the mainstream of China's colleges and universities will be the
state-run colleges and universities, supplemented by non-state-run
colleges and universities, institutions of higher learning jointly
run by Chinese and foreign organizations, and non-state-run
colleges with state assistance.
</P>
<P>
Colleges and universities began to raise funds from various
channels, as state budgets were no longer the only way of
receiving resources.
</P>
<P>
Up to date, 661 colleges and universities across the country
have started to charge students tuition fees this year. It means
almost two out of every three colleges and universities ask their
students to pay part of their college fees. College education
before 1994 was totally free in the country.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the government is also no longer the body to assigned
jobs to college graduates. The reform of job assignment has
enabled students who paid some of the tuition fees to find their
own jobs, with guidance of the government policies.
</P>
<P>
This was unimaginable several years ago. Once a student was
enrolled by a college or university, he or she would be assigned a
job naturally by the government prior to graduation.
</P>
<P>
During the past three years, 61 less competitive colleges and
universities were either closed or merged because they did not
have enough subjects on offer, or repetitive subjects with
others. Meanwhile, 48 new colleges and universities were set up to
cope with the demands of the market economy for professionals.

<HEADLINE> Tour of China Cycling Race Set for November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Encouraged by their success
last year in holding Asia's largest professional cycling race in
China, organizers announced that this year's race has been set for
early November.
</P>
<P>
The 10-day event starting on November 1 consists of a prologue,
which is a short-time trial stage, and six special timed stages,
with venues spread in Hong Kong and Chinese cities of Shenzhen,
Guangzhou, Foshan, Zhaoqing and Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The total length of racing routes is about 668 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Participating in this year's Tour of China will be more than
100 racers from seven countries -- Italy, Belgium, Spain,
Australia, Germany, the United States and China. And a list of
participants is expected to be announced soon.
</P>
<P>
China, widely taken as the kingdom of bicycles, is sending a
seven-racer team named Kent China Team. The members were picked up
from the winners of the recent national championships in
Changping, which is in Beijing's suburbs.
</P>
<P>
Tang Xuezhong, 27, from Beijing, is the star of the Chinese
squad. A national champion for many years and two-time Asian
championship winner, Tang has just started a professional career
in Japan.
</P>
<P>
"I'm confident of this year's race," said the racer, who was
absent from last year's Tour of China.
</P>
<P>
"We've been improved a lot through last year's race," said Li
Chunchang, head coach of the Chinese team.
</P>
<P>
As this year's routes are arranged on relatively flat roads, Li
expected better performance from his racers, who are thought not
favored for hilly sections.
</P>
<P>
"I think some of our racers could reach a higher overall
ranking this year," he said.
</P>
<P>
Pan Guangchun, 24, from Liaoning Province, Northeast China,
finished 44th overall in last year's Tour of China.

<P>
MOSCOW, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Chechan separatist leader
Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev is ready to go to Moscow this week to
discuss a settlement of the Chechen crisis, according to Russian
security chief Alexander Lebed.
</P>
<P>
Lebed told Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin this at a
briefing today, the premier's press secretary, Vladimir Konnov,
told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
If everything went as expected, Chernomyrdin and Yandarbiyev
would meet to confirm principles of forming the Chechen
provisional coalition government, its composition, relationship
with the Russian federal authorities and its funding from the
federal budget, sources close to the government said.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the meeting between Chernomyrdin and Lebed
lasted about an hour. It also touched upon the process of the
withdrawal of Russian troops from Chechnya and the formation of a
Chechen coalition government for the period preceding the free and
fair elections in the breakaway North Caucasus republic.
</P>
<P>
However, Chechen separatist spokesman Movladi Udugov declared
today that the exact date for the visit of Yandarbiyev to Moscow
had yet to be set, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Reception Marking 47th Anniversary of PRC Founding (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The outstanding feature of
China's economic development at present is that the country has
been able to achieve rapid economic growth and successfully keep
inflation under control at the same time.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Premier Li Peng gave the remark this evening at a grand
reception in the Great Hall of the People here to mark the 47th
anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin, Chairman of the Standing
Committee of the National People's Congress Qiao Shi, Chairman of
the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference Li Ruihuan, Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji,
Vice-Chairman of the Central Military Commission Liu Huaqing,
Member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the
Chinese Communist Party Central Committee Hu Jintao, and
Vice-President Rong Yiren, as well as senior Party and government
leaders and army officers, and diplomatic envoys of various
countries in the Chinese capital, totalling 1,300, attended the
reception.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng backed up his statement by listing a number of
indicators, including a good harvest so far this year, the
reinforced efforts in reforming state-owned enterprises, an
anticipated modest growth in foreign trade with a rough balance
between imports and exports, the continuous increase in the use of
foreign capital, and the expansion of foreign exchange
reserves. While at the same time, various undertakings, such as
science and technology and education and culture, have made further
headway, and efforts to promote socialist culture and ethics have
been stepped up.
</P>
<P>
What China has attained on various fronts this year has
provided favorable conditions for various work next year, and
created a good beginning for the implementation of the Ninth
Five-Year Plan starting this year, Li Peng said.
</P>
<P>
"The year of 1997 will be very important in the political life
of our country," he said, stressing that "we will, under the
leadership of the Party Central committee with Jiang Zemin at the
core, exert concerted efforts to make further progress in reform,
opening-up and the modernization drive."

<HEADLINE> Zyuganov Calls on Yeltsin to Step Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Russian Communist Party Leader
Gennady Zyuganov told a press conference today that President
Boris Yeltsin ought to step down because of his serious illness.
</P>
<P>
As Yeltsin's main rival in the summer elections in which
Yeltsin won a second term of presidency, Zyuganov stressed that
fresh presidential elections would be the most suitable outcome to
the current situation in Russia.
</P>
<P>
Zyuganov said his party was still waiting for an official
report on Yeltsin's health. Doctors had said Yeltsin needed heart
surgery in six to 10 weeks.
</P>
<P>
"Yeltsin has not been at work since June 17. The country has
been run from a dacha, from (the resort of) Sochi before, but
never from a hospital" he complained.
</P>
<P>
Zyuganov said the country, in need of constant, daily care,
deserved more than the three hours a day the president was now
capable of giving.
</P>
<P>
He said that his communist members in parliament would be
insisting on a new law for a medical commission to report on
Yeltsin's health.
</P>
<P>
Zyuganov also voiced support for national security chief
Alexander Lebed for his efforts to achieve a Chechen
settlement. He said the communists would back all Lebed's efforts
in Chechnya "if they do not contradict the principle of the
territorial integrity of Russia."

<P>
Referring to China's diplomatic policy, Li Peng said, China's
relations with other countries have grown stronger on the basis of
the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence. Mutual
understanding, trust and friendship have been further enhanced and
China's international reputation has been boosted in the cause of
safeguarding state sovereignty, territorial integrity and national
dignity.
</P>
<P>
He said "we have always upheld principles, withstood pressure,
and waged justifiable and restrained struggles when time is right,
which has yielded significant results."
</P>
<P>
Li went on to note that recently a tiny handful of
right-wingers and militarists in Japan have created a series of
incidents which have interfered with, and undermined Sino-Japanese
relations.
</P>
<P>
"We urge the Japanese side to strictly observe the principles
of the Sino-Japanese Joint Statement in safeguarding the overall
interests of the relations between the two countries," Li said,
stressing that "no action that hurts the feelings of the Chinese
people will get anywhere."
</P>
<P>
There are 274 days before the resumption by the Chinese
government of the exercise of sovereignty over Hong kong, and all
the preparations have been going on effectively, Li said.
</P>
<P>
"We have full confidence in achieving a smooth transition and
transfer of power in Hong Kong, and maintaining long-term
prosperity and stability there," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"The governments of China and Portugal have been closely
cooperating with each other on the question of Macao. Taiwan has
always been the sacred territory of China since ancient times. We
will unswervingly pursue the policy of "peaceful reunification and
one country, two systems."
</P>
<P>
"We firmly oppose any attempt to create "two Chinas" or "one
China, one Taiwan". It is our firm belief that with the concerted
efforts of the Chinese people, including our compatriots in
Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao and overseas Chinese, we will surely
be able to fulfill the sacred cause of the reunification of the
motherland," added Li.
</P>
<P>
China steadfastly pursues an independent foreign policy of
peace, and will forever be a staunch force for world peace and
stability. The Chinese government and the people are ready to work
tirelessly with governments and people of other countries the
world over for a splendid better new world, Li concluded.

<HEADLINE> Official Praises Sino-Portuguese Cooperation in Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, September 30 (Xinhua) -- A top Chinese official in Macao
today highly praised cooperative relations between China and
Portugal on the question of Macao, saying new progress has been
achieved in transitional affairs.
</P>
<P>
Wang Qiren, director of the Xinhua News Agency Macao Branch,
said in a speech that the transitional process of Macao has been
going in a good and stable way since Macao entered its
transitional period. He was addressing a ceremony marking the
47th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
"The cooperative relations between China and Portugal continue
to go well," said Wang, adding, "Major transitional issues, such
as the localization of civil servants, the localization of law,
and the use of Chinese as official language, have scored new
progress through consultations and exchanges of views between the
two sides."
</P>
<P>
He quoted a recent speech by Chinese Premier Li Peng as saying
that problems left over from the past in Macao are being gradually
 solved on the basis of good cooperation between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The director praised Macao residents as playing an important
role in the resolution of transitional issues, saying they have
helped the social and economic development, the training of
talented people and the promotion of the Basic Law of Macao.
</P>
<P>
He said that transitional issues should be resolved at a
quicker speed, since only a little more than three years remain
before China assumes the exercise of sovereignty over Macao.
</P>
<P>
"It is our hope and belief that the two sides will continue
their cooperation on the basis of the Sino-Portuguese Joint
Declaration so that all transitional issues will be solved
properly, and a stable transition will be realized," he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he pledged that China will, as always, cooperate
actively with the Portuguese side in maintaining economic
development and the social stability of Macao.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Macao Governor Vasco Rocha Vieira also highly
praised the spirit of understanding between Portugal and China in
handling the transitional issues of Macao.
</P>
<P>
"We have reason to be confident in marching toward the future,
although we should be aware that the transition is not a
short-term and easy way," the governor said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that he believed the Macao Government would
continue to have the full cooperation of the Xinhua News Agency
Macao Branch in the process of transition, so that Macao will
maintain its development and social stability.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Woman Pole Vaulter Sets New Asian Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 30 (Xinhua) -- China's Cai Weiyan cleared
4.32 meters to set a new Asian record for the women's pole vault
here on Sunday in the China Athletics Grand Prix finals.
</P>
<P>
Cai's performence beat the previous Asian record of 4.25 meters
set by her countrywoman Sun Caiyun early this season.
</P>
<P>
The 23-year-old failed to beat the current world record of
4.45m, but the winning jump ranked her the second best in the
world.
</P>
<P>
Sun, former world record holder with a personal best of 4.25m,
only cleared 4.10m behind her teammate Zhong Guiqing, who also
leaped over 4.10m.
</P>
<P>
With the victory, Cai became the overall female winner with 78
points from eight Grand Prix events this year. China introduced
the Grand Prix series in 1996 with an aim to create more
competitions for its athletes. Track and field is not a popular
sport in the country, though Wang Junxia won the women's 5,000m
gold medal at the Atlanta Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Wang, who took part in both the women's 5,000m and 10,000m in
Atlanta last month, pulled out of the day's race due to tireness.
</P>
<P>
A total of 18 events were held today at Beijing Olympic Center
in front of a few hundreds of local fans.
</P>
<P>
"The sport lacks sponsors and the prize money is not big
enough. The overall winner of the Grand Prix could only get about
4,000 RENMINBI (less than 500 U.S.Dollars)," said Duan Shijie, a
top official of the Chinese Athletics Association.
</P>
<P>
"Chinese athletes could only take part in two or three
competitions each year in the past. Now with the new competition
series, they are able to participate in more meetings and that
will do them a lot of good," added Duan.
</P>
<P>
Other Chinese star athletes like long jumper Huang Geng, Shot
putter Huang Zhihong and world class walker Gao Hongmiao didn't
take part in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Chen Wenzhong, the male overall winner of the Grand Prix,
clocked 10.21 seconds today, collecting 72 points from six
straight wins.
</P>
<P>
According to Duan, the total prize money of the Grand Pris is
about 80,000 U.S. Dallars.

<HEADLINE> Taliban Advancing Further North in Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban Militia
today advanced further north and approached the areas under the
control of the Uzbek Militia led by Rashid Dostum, said a report
reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The advancing Taliban forces were chasing the ex-government
troops led by Ahmed Shah Masood and moved closer to the strategic
Salang Pass, about 100 kilometers north of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
The Uzbek Militia, which controls seven provinces in northern
Afghanistan, has become the Taliban's major rival as the
ex-government troops were defeated by the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban captured Kabul last Friday, ousting the government
led by President Burhanuddin Rabbani and Prime Minister Gulbuddin
Hekmatyar.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban seized Charikar, capital of Parwan Province, about
63 kilometers north of Kabul, and the town of Jabal Saraj, about
77 kilometers north of Kabul, on Sunday, leaving no chance for
Masood to regroup his troops.
</P>
<P>
Now, Masood's troops continued their retreat toward the
Panjshir Valley in northeastern Afghanistan, which is the original
base of Masood whose nickname is the "lion of Panjshir."

<TEXT>
<P>
GUILIN, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Liangjiang International
Airport, in the scenic city of Guilin in south China's Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region, was today preparing for take-off after

<P>
Arafat flew to Egypt this morning for urgent consultations
with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, who was also invited to
the summit by U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
A PA official said that Arafat has asked President Clinton to
postpone the summit, originally scheduled for Tuesday and
Wednesday, until its success can by assured.
</P>
<P>
According to a report from Cairo, Mubarak might not travel to
Washington because he will host the Turkish president during the
two days.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa might attend the summit on his
behalf. But the real reason is that Mubarak, a key Middle East
peace broker, was annoyed by Netanyahu's refusal to an
invitation sent by him for a summit to be held in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is said to insist that Mubarak should be present at
the Washington summit.

Panchen Lama's fine tradition of loving the motherland and
religion."

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 30 (Xinhua) -- German President Roman Herzog
has decided to postpone his planned visit to Russia due to
Russian President Boris Yeltsin's coming heart surgery.
</P>
<P>
The Russian presidential press service said today that Yeltsin
and Herzog had reached agreement over the issue.
</P>
<P>
The German President's visit to Russia was initially planned
for October 12-14.
</P>
<P>
A council of doctors said last week that the power vacuum in
Russia would remain until President Yeltsin had his bypass
operation in six to 10 weeks to improve blood supply to his heart.
</P>
<P>
Because doctors did not set a specific date for surgery, the
new dates for Herzog's visit would be coordinated via diplomatic
channels, the statement added.

<P>
Referring to the Hong Kong people who want to return to the
Diaoyu Islands, he said, "We entirely understand the Hong Kong

sovereignty over Hong Kong, adding that "We are working to ensure
Hong Kong's stable transition and smooth transfer of power, while
laying a solid foundation for the establishment and operation of
the government of Hong Kong Special administrative Region, to
maintain a long-term stability and prosperity of Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
"This is also the common will and goal of the 6.3 million Hong
Kong people, and is in the interests of Britain, and investors to
Hong Kong from all over the world, so it will be surely achieved,"
he said.
</P>
<P>

demonstrating further co-operation on the Hong Kong question.

Stockholm, September 30 (Xinhua) -- A Swedish Mp suggested in a
bill that Sweden should initiates a campaign to place future
summer Olympic Games in Greece instead of running for the 2004
Games in Stockholm.
</P>
<P>
Rigmor Ahlstedt from the Centre Party, the supporting party to
the minority Social Democrat government, said Greece, the
birthplace of Olympics movement, is an ideal place for all the
summer Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"Greece is a suitable and natural choice for the games. The
money spent by the organizing cities today could instead be used
to support young people taking part in the games," she said.
</P>
<P>
Ahlstedt believed that the Atlanta Olympics showed that the
2004-candidate Stockholm had little to gain from hosting the
games.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Protests Israeli Actions in Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Jordan strongly protested here
today Israel's measures to reopen a disputed archeological
tunnel near the Al Aqsa Mosque compound in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Abdul Karim Kabariti summoned the Israeli
Ambassador in Jordan Shimon Shamir and launched the protest of
the opening of the tunnel, which triggered bloody clashes
between Israeli troops and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Kabariti affirmed Jordan's solid position in rejecting any
unilateral measure by Israel aimed at changing the cultural,
historical and demographical reality of the Holy City of
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
He said such move indicates only that Israel claims the
sovereignty over Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The premier pointed to the international resolutions which
have repeatedly rejected the Israeli claims.
</P>
<P>
He stressed Jordan's primary concern to see the
U.N. resolutions and the Israeli-Palestinian agreements
implemented to push forward the peace process in the region.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said the kingdom, which pledges to adhere
to its peace treaty with Israel, expected the same attitude from
the Israeli side, particularly vis-a-vis items in the treaty
which stipulates Jordan's supervision of the holy sites in
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The protest is the strongest response to the Israeli actions
in Jerusalem by the Jordanian government since the clashes
between Israelis and Palestinians took place last week following
 the Israeli reopening of the tunnel.
</P>
<P>
The government, which hopes to keep unbiased in the
Israeli-Palestinian hostilities which have claimed nearly 60
Palestinians and 14 Israelis, has not denounced the Israeli
moves so far as other Arab countries and the European powers
did, observers here said.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein has criticized Israel's reopening of the
controversial tunnel and asked for a thorough investigation into
the effects of the move by an international body.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that Jordan will continue its role in
supervising and protecting the holy shrines in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The king said Saturday that the crisis showed that Jordan's
position that there should not be any gap in sovereignty over
Jerusalem was right and that the Israeli move was aimed at
showing that the Jewish State had the sole say in Jerusalem
affairs.
</P>
<P>
He said Jordan had no prior knowledge of the Israeli plan to
reopen the tunnel.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian-Israeli peace treaty signed in October 1994
acknowledges the kingdom's "special role" vis-a-vis the Islamic
holy sites in Arab east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The king said the provision was designed to cover any gap in
sovereignty in Jerusalem until such time Palestinians and
Israelis negotiate and reach a final agreement on the future of
the holy city.
</P>
<P>
But he noted that the Palestinians had not made their stand
clear on the holy city and Jordan's role.
</P>
<P>
The provision in the peace treaty caused Palestinians'
suspicion in Jordan's intention which led to Jordan's give-up of
its "special role."

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 30 (Xinhua) -- People from various circles
in Hong Kong held a ceremony last night in memory of David Chan
Yuk-cheung, an advisor on Hong Kong affairs.
</P>
<P>
Since July right wingers from Japan have mounted the Diaoyu
Islands four times and erected illegal signs and facilities in
violation of Chinese territorial integrity and sovereignty. This
has aroused the indignation of the Chinese people, including Hong
Kong compatriots.
</P>
<P>
On September 26, a protest boat, "Bao Diao Hao", which was
organized by David Chan Yuk-cheung and others, was obstructed by
Japanese patrol boats when it entered the sea around the Diaoyu
Islands. David Chan and several Hong Kong compatriots jumped into
the seas from the vessel in protest, and he was unfortunately
drowned in turbulent waters.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs
immediately made comments on the incident, mourned the loss of
David Chan and expressed condolences to his family.
</P>
<P>
Vice Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan called in Japan's ambassador
to China on September 27 and made representations to Japan.
</P>
<P>
At the memorial ceremony on September 29, the condolence
messages from the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office under the
State Council, Director of Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch
Zhou Nan and overseas communities were read.

<HEADLINE> HK Total Deposits Rise Slightly in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's total deposits
increased by 0.3 percent, following a rise of 0.8 percent in July,
according to statistics published today by the Hong Kong Monetary
Authority.
</P>
<P>
Of the total deposits, Hong Kong dollar deposits grew by 1.2
percent in August while foreign currency deposits dropped by 0.8
percent.
</P>
<P>
Of the HK dollar deposits, savings and time deposits rose,
outweighing the decline in demand deposits.
</P>
<P>
The decline in foreign currency deposits was due entirely to a
2.2 percent fall in non-US dollar foreign currency deposits, while
 US dollar deposits were up by 0.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, total loans and advances edged lower by 0.3 percent
in August, following an increase of 2.2 percent in July.
</P>
<P>
The fall reflects a decline in offshore lending and a more
moderate growth in domestic credit.

MANILA, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Representatives from 18 member
economies of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) will
start a conference here tomorrow to discuss food and agricultural

</P>
<P>
Philippine officials in the APEC said today the conference will

</P>
<P>
They said some 20 analysts from the region's various academic
and research institutions and the private sector will present
papers on three major topics during the conference.

</P>
<P>
APEC officials said the 18 member economies have put emphasis
on the agricultural sector because it is the major source of
income and employment in developing economies and also the main
source of raw materials, capital and labor for industrialization.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Takes Measures to Curb Foreign Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Jordan announced 15 sectors
in which non-Jordanian workers will be banned from taking job
from the beginning of next year, the English-language daily
Jordan Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
Even the exceptional cases which were allowed to employ
non-Jordanians, for humanitarian or any other reason, will have
to abide by the new regulation and terminate the work of all
foreign labor.
</P>
<P>
The listed 15 sectors are medical and engineering
professions, management, accounting, typing, secretarial,
telephone exchanges, warehouses, salespersons, hairdressing,
decoration, education, gas stations, electricity, driving,
guards and messengers.
</P>
<P>
The move is aimed at reducing the current unemployment rate,
which is believed to stand at 15 percent, through restricting
foreign laborers and reducing their number in the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Official Figures show that there are more than 400,000 foreign
workers in the kingdom, mainly Egyptians.
</P>
<P>
Last year, a similar regulation to ban foreign laborers from
taking jobs in some sectors was introduced but was ignored by
the local businessmen who preferred foreign laborers to
Jordanians, because the foreign workers occupy the lower-pay and
long-work-hour jobs.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 30 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's
international removals industry is doing roaring business as an
increasing number of people emigrate because of the violent crime
in the country.
</P>
<P>
Trevor Thomson, Managing Director of Thomson International
Movers, told the latest issue of the "Business Report" that his
company had experienced a surge since February.
</P>
<P>
"We have seen chicken runs, but now it's not only doctors and
lawyers leaving, but also diesel mechanics and farmers, " he
disclosed to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The loss of skilled South Africans is causing serious concern
of the government, which needs their expertise to help
reconstruct the country and improve an economy made stagnant
during the years of apartheid.
</P>
<P>
Thomson compared the migration levels to those which followed the
Soweto uprising in 1976 and the Boipatong massacre in 1992.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, 4818 South Africans left the
country permanently during the first five months of this year, as
against 3960 for the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Of the emigrants, 2559 were economically active. In most
cases, the emigration destinations were the United Kingdom,
Australia, New Zealand, the United States and Canada.

<HEADLINE> Sierra Leone, Iran to Expand Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Iran and Sierra Leone today
voiced their readiness to expand the bilateral relations and
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Visiting Sierra Leone President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah said that
Iran and Sierra Leone enjoy common views on the need to establish
peace and stability throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark this morning after he was formally greeted
by his Iranian counterpart Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani at Sa'd-Abad
Palace situated in northern Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Kabbah, who arrived here Sunday night, expressed his
satisfaction over the current level of the two countries'
relations, adding that Sierra Leone is determined to upgrade
bilateral cooperation in all areas.
</P>
<P>
On his part, President Rafsanjani said that Iran attaches
importance to its ties with African countries, Sierra Leone in
particular.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leone is rich in natural resources, but most of which
has remained untapped, so they do not contribute to the betterment
of people's life, he added.
</P>
<P>
Iran is ready to help Sierra Leone in the fields of industries,
mines, agriculture, culture, education, fisheries and
transportation, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Iran's official news agency IRNA, Sierra Leone's
new ambassador to Iran Haja Alari Cole has asked for Iran's
cooperation with his country in the areas of water and electricity.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his country's interest in expanding economic ties
with Iran, purchasing Iranian-made generators and in constructing
dams in cooperation with Iranian experts.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Renews Call for Implementing PLO-Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak has renewed his call for the full implementation of the
agreements reached between Israel and the Palestine Liberation
Organization (PLO).
</P>
<P>
In an interview published today, Mubarak said that
implementing the agreements is the only solution to end the
tragic crisis in the occupied Arab land.
</P>
<P>
He told the weekly newspaper Mayo, the mouthpiece of Egypt's
ruling National Democratic Party, that each side should abide its
commitments to the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
He warned that disrespect of binding agreements would drive
other parties to lose confidence and refuse to continue their
peace march.
</P>
<P>
His statements came after Israel's opening of a tunnel near Al
Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem triggered clashes between the
Palestinian protesters and Israeli troops, which left more than
70 people dead and some 1,100 others injured in the past few days.
</P>
<P>
The president, who has acted as a mediator in Arab-Israeli
peace talks, blamed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for
the deteriorating conditions in the Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Israeli hesitation to implement the binding
agreements along with its increasing economic pressure on the
Palestinian people has led to this situation.
</P>
<P>
He once again warned that there might be a new intifada, or
uprising, against the Israeli occupation of Palestinian land.
</P>
<P>
"I again repeat my warning that the new intifada by the misled
Palestinians will not be that of stone-throwing. It (the new
intifada) will be something more than that," he was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"We witnessed the iceberg of it in the past few days when
dozens of innocent Palestinians were killed and hundreds
injured," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak met with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in Egypt's
port city of Alexandria today for talks on the peace process and
current situation in the Palestinian land.
</P>
<P>
Following the talks, Arafat is to fly to Washington for a
five-way summit hosted by U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, Netanyahu, King Hussein of Jordan have accepted
Clinton's invitation to attend the summit. But Mubarak has not
yet made it clear whether he will participate.

<HEADLINE> Australia's Wool Sales Pick Up After Big Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Wool sales picked up in
Sydney and Geelong today after big falls last week when the
eastern market indicator closed at 574 Australian cents (453 US
cents) a kilogram clean, down 15 cents over the week.
</P>
<P>
Wool exporters said that prices have fallen considerably with
excess quantities of fine to medium wool on offer, eroding the
significant price differentials. Broader wool prices have now
fallen back to their low levels of May 1996 when they began to
experience a relative price upturn," according to a press release
here today.
</P>
<P>
This indicates that further significant falls for these types
are unlikely if Chinese activity remains at current levels.
Continued volatility is expected for fine to medium types and
increased European activity is necessary to maintain this end of
the market.
</P>
<P>
Despite current limited interest from many of those buyers, a
number of European trade fairs are just beginning, and a majority
of their orders are now placed for prompt delivery rather than for
stocks.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that sales this week will have 69,566 bales on
offer in both Sydney and Geelong.

AMMAN, September 30 (Xinhua) -- King Hussein of Jordan left
here today for Washington to attend the U.S.-sponsored
quadripartite summit scheduled to be held Tuesday to rescue the
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The summit, called by U.S. President Bill Clinton to end the
Israeli-Palestinian confrontations which have claimed nearly 70
people, will group Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, Israeli Prime
 Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and
 King Hussein.
</P>
<P>
The summit is aimed at saving the endangered Middle East peace
process in the wake of bloody clashes between Israeli security
forces and Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and West Bank.
</P>
<P>
After King Hussein accepted Clinton's invitation Sunday, he
called Mubarak and Arafat to exchange views with them to coordinate
stands.
</P>
<P>
Reports here said Arafat demanded earlier today that the
U.S. president delay the scheduled summit until the details of the
agenda are settled.
</P>
<P>
But Clinton has not responded to Arafat's request, the reports
said.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak has not yet decided to participate in the Washington

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Kuwaiti Women Demand Political Rights (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Demands for political
rights for women in Kuwait has become one of the major issues
mostly attracting social and media attention during the run-up to
the October 7 parliament elections.
</P>
<P>
Women activists have been strongly calling for voting rights
to be granted in the upcoming polls of the parliament which would
bring Kuwait to next century.
</P>
<P>
Activists for women's rights have renewed their 30-year
campaign for what some see as a right guaranteed by Kuwait's
constitution and Islam.
</P>
<P>
In one of the efforts to demand women's political rights since
the beginning of the current parliamentary campaign, some 300
Kuwaiti men and women held so far the largest rally Sunday at the
Kuwaiti lawyers society to demand political rights for women in
response to a call by the Women's Issues Committee which groups
12 non-governmental organizations.
</P>
<P>
Among the people gathering there were some of the 240
candidates for the coming elections, academics, lawyers,
teachers, housewives, students and human rights activists.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, 600 women had signed a petition in support of the
rally, in addition to around 500 men who had also inked their
support for women's rights.
</P>
<P>
The question of granting women the right to nomination and
voting has dominated private and public debates in the heated
run-up to the polls.
</P>
<P>
The women activists based their demand on the fact that the
Kuwaiti constitution stipulates that "all people are equal in
human dignity, and in public rights and duties before the law,
without distinction as to race, origin, language or religion,"
claiming that both sexes should have equal opportunities
according to the constitution.
</P>
<P>
According to the last population census conducted in April
1995, Kuwait has a population of 681,526. Women total 343,592,
representing 50.41 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
The census also showed that the Kuwaiti labour force totaled
165,900 employees and that 52,514 women are working in various
sectors. They account for nearly 80 percent of the educational
faculties, run businesses, head diplomatic missions and help to
steer the country's oil industry but they are still barred from
running for parliament or even voting.
</P>
<P>
Presently, the women activists are fighting on two fronts --
to lobby men to support their right to vote while persuading
women to back their struggle.
</P>
<P>
"A women should stay at home and raise children," said one
liberal candidate.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Kuwaiti Women Demand Political Rights (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thousands of professional women ignored the rally Sunday. a
female civil servant who has been wearing a blue ribbon for weeks
to demand political rights said, "I believe in it and support it,
but I don't see the wisdom behind a work strike," referring to
the rally.
</P>
<P>
The issue of women's political rights in Kuwait was raised by
previous parliaments and the 1992 Assembly discussed suggestions
to give women the right to vote ahead of giving them the right
to nomination for the National Assembly elections.
</P>
<P>
A delegation of women activists submitted a memo to the
speaker of the parliament in December 1971, first making the
demand for political rights after the first women's conference
in Kuwait. But it was rejected by the parliament.
</P>
<P>
In 1982, a new proposal in this regard was raised but was
rejected again. Kuwaiti Crown Prince and Prime Minister Sheikh
Saad Al-Abdullah Al-Sabah said in a comment to the rejection then
that "the fact that the proposal was rejected does not mean the
door is closed."
</P>
<P>
Women activists have held sporadic protests since the
begining of this year to demand political rights. In march,
about 40 woman lawyers, scientists and academics demonstrated
outside parliament.
</P>
<P>
It is time that the Kuwaiti women's political rights were
recognized and they became members of parliament, chairwoman of
the Women's Social and Cultural Society Adela Al-Sayer said
while stressing that "our government should allow us to take
part in political decision-making."
</P>
<P>
A women consultant at parliament and a university teacher
told Xinhua that "political awareness among men was less in the
past, now they are better. This is also true for women."
</P>
<P>
However, during the current election campaigns, few candidates
called for giving women full political rights.
</P>
<P>
The possibility of raising the issue at the current
parliament seems tiny due to the limited time it still has and
the fact that most of its members are contesting the October 7
legislative elections, an activist said.

<HEADLINE> Armenia to Arrest Five Opposition MPs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Armenian Prosecutor-General
Artavazd Gevorkia has signed a warrant for the arrest of five
parliament members, charged with involvement in mass rioting in
Yerevan, the country's capital, last Wednesday and attempting a
"state coup", said the reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on national television overnight, Gevorkia identified
the five as Ruben Akopian, Shavarsh Kocharian, David Vardanian,
Seiran Avagian and Arshak Sadoian. Among them, only Sadoian is
still free and a hunt for him has been declared.
</P>
<P>
Apart from these deputies, the parliament has stripped
parliamentary immunity from Paruir Airikian, Nerses Zeynalvadian
and Vazgen Manukian.
</P>
<P>
The parliament also granted the Prosecutor-General's request to
start criminal proceedings against the opposition parliament
deputies.
</P>
<P>
Following mass rallies in Yerevan last Wednesday, thousands of
the opposition supporters broke into the parliament building and
beat the parliament speaker Babken Ararktsian and his deputy Aru
Saakian.
</P>
<P>
These opposition supporters took such an action in protest
against alleged fraud in presidential elections on September 22,
in which, incumbent President Levon Ter-Petrosian was re-elected
for a second term.

<HEADLINE> Giant Panda Fawns on Visitors  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, September 30 -- (By Xinhua Correspondent Li Pei) In
a 40-square-meter-cave adjacent to a verdant stadium, a charmingly
naive giant panda was busy chewing and snapping tender bamboo
shoots. Occasionally, his head wagged, with an air of satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
As a group of tourists from Japan and Malaysia filed into the
cave through a delicate iron door and neared him, the giant panda,
"Fei Fei" (Flying Flying) as it is named, promptly got elated,
looping the loop and rubbing his shiny hair lovely against
incoming tourists.
</P>
<P>
Fei Fei would raise his head and gaze at them with a
reluctant manner whenever visitors were about to leave.
</P>
<P>
In a sharp comparison, another giant panda living next door was
fairly unfriendly and sometimes would bite the raiser.
</P>
<P>
This is a scene Xinhua correspondent recorded recently in the
Chongqing Zoo of southwest China's Sichuan Province, a major
habitat of giant pandas. The other two habitats are in Shaanxi
and Gansu provinces in northwest China.
</P>
<P>
An American old couple were feeding Fei Fei with apples and
stroking him for several minutes and took a picture with him.
</P>
<P>
"Fei Fei had long been sick and under intensive
care. Therefore, he is very dependent and affectionate to human
being," said Guo Hua, a young expert on giant pandas, adding that
she harbors the intention to study Fei Fei in order to find out
whey he acts this way.
</P>
<P>
Fei Fei was born in Tianquan County of Sichuan Province 24
years ago. In 1980, arrow bamboos, giant pandas' staple food,
began blooming and withering quickly. Giant pandas, who are
regarded as "living fossil", had nothing to eat then.
</P>
<P>
People immediately sent Fei Fei and other 60 giant pandas to
various zoos in order to save them by providing them with safe
shelter and good food. At that time, Fei Fei was seemingly
obedient but in fact he was very temperamental and very impolite
to the raiser.
</P>
<P>
To the surprise of the zoo authorities, the 120-kg Fei Fei was
unable to be a father because of his sexual incompetence. He was
inflicted with cerebral thrombosis in 1987, which paralyzed his
left side. In 1990 and 1992, he was twice stricken by cerebral
thrombosis, which made Fei Fei seriously ill.

<TEXT>
<P>
Since China only has some 1,000 giant pandas living in the wild
and no more than 100 in the zoo, so every giant panda is vitally
important to China and the rest of the world. Specialists have
spared no effort to save all giant pandas.
</P>
<P>
Liu Xinhua, an experienced giant panda raiser, looked after Fei
Fei day and night each time he fell ill together with his
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that all doctors treating Fei Fei were famous
specialists in the country and their instruments were the most
advanced at the time. To ensure steady food supply, the zoo
opened up a tract of land and planted arrow bamboos in Jinyun
Mountain, a scenic spot 100 kilometers away. The bamboos were
sent to the zoo every day. Fei Fei could eat eight kilograms of
bamboos, fruits, imported milk, minced meat and powder calcium a
day.
</P>
<P>
Fei Fei was recovering with each passing day because of
intensive care. To people's surprise, Fei Fei was very close to
people and always held the legs of the raiser to show his
gratefulness. He was also friendly to strangers like a baby.
</P>
<P>
Giant panda experts concluded that this shows that giant pandas
are sentimental. They understand people and have rich feelings.
To discover the secrets that Fei Fei recovered so well, the zoo
where he is staying, allowed Fei Fei to play with visitors one
hour every day beginning from the International Children's Day of
1993. Fei Fei suddenly became the star of the zoo and friend of
thousands of people.
</P>
<P>
Fei Fei has become robust with intensive care over the past
three years. What is more surprising is that Fei Fei, who has not
been able to a father, has succeeded in copulating with a female
giant panda named "Xi Xi", who later gave birth to a baby panda.
</P>
<P>
Giant pandas usually lose their propagation ability after the
age of 19 and die at the age of 23 or 24. However, the
24-year-old Fei Fei is still very strong.
</P>
<P>
Yao Minda, deputy director of the China Giant Panda Breeding
Center, said that the phenomenon is never seen in the giant
panda's breeding history and is also the first case in the zoo's
breeding history.

<HEADLINE> King Hussein Gives Full Support to Kabariti </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 30 (Xinhua) -- King Hussein has expressed his
full support of the Kabariti government in the midst of the
severe confrontations between the government, the Parliament and
opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
During a cabinet meeting chaired by the King Saturday, he told
the cabinet of Prime Minister Abdul Karim Kabariti to remain in
office and unchanged for some time to come to press ahead its
programs, Jordan Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
"You are at the beginning of the road," the King was quoted
by an informed source as saying.
</P>
<P>
"You should press ahead (with implementing your programs) in
the realization that there would be no reshuffle or change."
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that the king's assertion is an
indication that the government will remain in office probably
until next spring, although recent widespread rumors said that
the government's resignation or a reshuffle might take place in
the coming two months.
</P>
<P>
The king's statement to the cabinet, coupled with a public
statement in Qatar two days earlier that no change of cabinet was
in the offing, came against the backdrop of continued demands by
the opposition parties that Kabariti government resign or be
sacked.
</P>
<P>
Tensions between the government, the Parliament and opposition
parties increased after the government decided to lift subsidies
on bread and fodder last month despite the fact that the
Parliament and the opposition parties had warned of possible riots
beforehands.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties denounced the government decision,
charging that it should bear the responsibilities of the
so-called "bread riots" in the southern parts of the Kingdom in
mid-August.
</P>
<P>
The tension escalated last week following Kabariti's comments
last Monday that the opposition parties in the Kingdom are
"people in crisis."
</P>
<P>
He accused the opposition of not providing viable options to
solve the country's problems of poverty, unemployment,
indebtedness and corruption but criticizing the government
policies and placing obstacles on the path of reform.
</P>
<P>
The opposition, led by the largest parliamentary bloc Islamic
Action Front (IAF), the political arm of the Moslem Brotherhood,
accused the government and the prime minister of being in crisis
and of being responsibly for the decision, which they said, led to
a sharp decline in the standards of living of people and to
souring the Jordan's relations with Iraq and other Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Reports here also said that the opposition parties asked King
Hussein to intervene, and even demand a new government to be
headed by former Minister of Information Ibrahim Izzedine.
</P>
<P>
However, there are no signs that this tension is about to
recede with both the government and the opposition raising their
level of criticism of each other, especially in light of
widespread expectations by the opposition that the government will
make some political change.
</P>
<P>
A government source disclosed last week that Kabariti would
consider bringing the Islamists into the government but IAF,
which has 16 representatives in the Lower House, said it would
not join the government.

<HEADLINE> Coke Addiction Damaged Maradona's Brain, Paper Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Coakine addiction could
damage Diego Maradona's brain, the Noticias newspaper said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
A medical report on Maradona revealed the condition was
irreversible and was responsible for his aggressive behaviour, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
The 35-year-old Maradona, who recently underwent psychiatric
treatment in Spain, has admitted he took cocaine for almost 10
years and the addiction finally brought his career to an end.
</P>
<P>
He was arrested in Buenos Aires in April 1991 for cocaine
possession, and five months later was given a 14-month suspended
prison sentence by an Italian court for the same offense.
</P>
<P>
He was also banned from international competition for 15 months
in 1991 after testing positive for cocaine use but made a rapid
recovery to play in the 1994 World Cup only to fail another drug
test, this time for the stimulant ephedrine.

JERUSALEM -- The closure on the Palestinian territories is
making it difficult for citrus farmers in the North of Israel to
harvest their red grapefruit crops, The Jerusalem Post reported
today.
</P>

the harvest will be delayed and the fruit will not be ready for
export.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- The former head of the spy agency Mossad, Nahum

<HEADLINE> Baltic States Insist on NATO Membership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Presidents of three Baltic
states -- Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania -- confirmed today their
desire to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) as
soon as possible, according to the reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
But they also said that they would also ensure national
security through the development of their own armed forces.
</P>
<P>
"We seek to provide for our security both through our own
efforts and through membership in the NATO as soon as possible,"
the three presidents noted.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the three former Soviet republics were reacting
to the statements made by U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry,
who said in a newspaper interview that it was possible to ensure
security in the Baltic region without accepting the three Baltic
states into NATO.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question whether the so-called "grey area" of
security was possible in the region if the Baltic states were not
accepted into NATO, Perry said such a zone already existed, as
Finland and Sweden were not concerned about their security
although they were not NATO members.
</P>
<P>
However, the Baltic presidents said they were against "any grey
areas."
</P>
<P>
"We believe in the principles of collective security. We do not
want to see new lines drawn in Europe and we do not want any grey
areas created where conflicts may arise as a result of
misunderstanding," presidents of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania
said in a joint statement.
</P>
<P>
The presidents stressed that from now on they would mount
diplomatic efforts to win international support for NATO
membership and would also begin upgrading their armed forces to
match up with NATO standards.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Take Children Away from Their Drug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Iranian authorities have
decided to take children away from their drug addicted parents and
bring them under special care, a local newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Persian daily Jumhuri Islami said that the decision was
endorsed by the Interior Ministry at its 53rd meeting Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Drug abuse is a big social problem in Iran. There are about
500,000 drug addicts in this country of 65 million. Some of the
addicts have been rehabilitated in special centers.
</P>
<P>
A specialist told Xinhua that it is a right decision to take
children away from their drug addicted parents, otherwise their
children will be ruined.
</P>
<P>
He said that there are two purposes for the move: to protect
children from turning into criminals or prostitutes and to prevent
them from being involved in drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that the Iman Khomeini Relief Committee would
take care of the children by offering them accommodations.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Ali Mohammad Besharati criticized the local
media for not paying enough attention to this social problem and
the campaign against narcotics.
</P>
<P>
He said that families and the youths should be informed about
the dangers of addiction through informative films and other
effective cultural tools.
</P>
<P>
The ministry also announced that 58 tons of narcotics was
confiscated during the second quarter of this Iranian year
(started on March 20). The figure show an increase
of 37 percent over the same period last year.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Former Rebel Chief Takes Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos today witnessed the installation of former rebel chief Nur
Misuari as governor of the autonomous region in Muslim Mindanao
(ARMM) and said that the move would contribute to the country's
political stability and economic development in southern
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a swearing-in ceremony in Cotabato city, the
president said that the installation of governor Misuari and other
officials of the ARMM institutionalizes the re-integration of the
Moro National Liberation Front led by Misuari into the
constitutional and democratic process in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
"This historic ceremony enhances the political stability we
have worked so hard to establish as a requisite of our economic
recovery and social reform program," Ramos said. "It will also
ushers in more equitable development in our southern regions."
</P>
<P>
Ramos assured Misuari and other incoming ARMM officials that he
is "all the way" for the ARMM. He said his government has provided
a bigger slice of the infrastructure as well as poverty
alleviation funds for Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ramos called on opponents to the Mindanao peace
agreement to "give peace a chance and join the mainstream of
development."
</P>
<P>
During a meeting between the president and ARMM leaders at the
same day, presidential management staff head Alexander Aguirre
said Ramos can legally designate or appoint Misuari as chairman of
the Southern Philippines Council for Peace and Development in a
concurrent capacity.

<HEADLINE> Take Measures to Salvage Middle East Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Concrete measures should be
taken to save the Middle East peace now jeopardized by the
continuous clash between the Israeli troops and Palestinians,
called a signed article in the Xinhua Daily Telegraph Monday.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after 100 days of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's
office, the article said, Israel directly provoked a massive
bloody clash by reopening a tunnel under a mosque in Jerusalem
last week, leaving more than 1,000 people killed or wounded.
</P>
<P>
The clash, lasting into the third day with no indication of
calming down, proves to be the most severe setback for peace since
the Israelis and Palestinians signed the peace accord in 1993, or
even since the Madrid Peace Conference five years ago.
</P>
<P>
"Without a doubt," the article went on to say, "it is the most
pressing matter of the moment for both the Israeli-Arab sides and
the international community to salvage the hard-earned Middle East
Peace Process through concrete measures, including the immediate
stopping of bloodshed and resuming of dialogues on equal footing
between the parties."
</P>
<P>
The international community, including the five Permanent
Members of the UN Security Council, holds that Israel is wholly
responsible for the bloodshed, in which it even used tanks and
helicopters, said the article.
</P>
<P>
The article pointed out that, since the Likud took office last
June, Israel has turned towards a policy of high-handed actions
against the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Not only did it refuse to implement the agreements it reached
with the Palestinians, but also it annulled resolutions on the
building of Israeli settlement passed by the last cabinet, thus
severely damping down the Palestinians' hope of autonomy.
</P>
<P>
Urging the Natanyahu's government to give up its policy of
"security for peace", the article said, Israel should carry out
the "land for peace" policy introduced by the Labour Party headed
by the late Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and ex-premier Shimon
Peres.
</P>
<P>
It concluded that it would be fortunate for the Middle East
peace, if Israeli prime minister could tackle the issue as a whole
instead of merely keeping the Jewish interest in mind, and
re-examine his policies toward the Palestinians and other Arab
nations.

<HEADLINE> Cruise Industry Can Boost Tourism: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The cruise industry is
gaining popularity and can be developed to boost tourism in the
Southeast Asian region, an official said today.
</P>
<P>
The region's rapid economic growth has created good
opportunities for the cruise industry, Malaysia-Indonesia-Thailand
Tourism Association Chairman Aidid Syed Murtaza said at a press
conference in Pulau Pinang, over 300 kilometers northwest of here.
</P>
<P>
Most ASEAN countries, especially Indonesia-Malaysia-Thailand
Growth Triangle (IMT-GT) members, have attractive destinations for
cruise liners and this potential should be tapped, he said, adding
that several countries saw the potential in this sector and were
developing the necessary infrastructure to attract tourists who go
on cruise.
</P>
<P>
"The cruise industry not only helps the economic growth of the
IMT-GT region but also opens up opportunities for ship suppliers,
port operators, land transport entrepreneurs, restaurateurs and
the likes," he was quoted by the Malaysian national news agency
Bernama as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the Indonesia-Malaysia-Thailand Business Council had
agreed to cooperate in the promotion of the cruise industry for
which a two-day IMT-GT seminar, the first of its kind in this
region, will be held from October 19 in Langkawi.

<HEADLINE> Joint Israeli-Palestinian Patrols Halted in West </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 30 (Xinhua) -- All joint
Israeli-Palestinian patrols in the West Bank have been put on
hold, as the Israeli army is deploying more tanks around
Palestinian-controlled areas, in an attempt to increase the
pressure on the Palestinians to stabilize the situation.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio this morning quoted a senior Israeli officer as
saying that the Palestinian police, which had quickly stepped in
to quell any sparks of unrest in the last two days, appear to have
gotten the message.
</P>
<P>
However, he warned that the situation could still erupt at any
time, since the high tension in the Palestinian autonomous areas
remains.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, joint Israeli-Palestinian patrols have resumed in
the Gaza Strip, after the two sides turned guns to each other in
last week's confrontation, which left over 70 dead and hundreds of
others wounded.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli officer pointed out that there has been a total
breakdown of confidence in the Palestinian police, who in some
cases reportedly shoot at Israeli soldiers with whom they had
patrolled only day before.
</P>
<P>
The two Israeli border police officers who were killed near
Tulkarm on Friday were members of the joint patrols, which
had been carried out since the start of the Palestinian
autonomy.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, chief of staff of the
Israeli army, said that he was doubtful if the situation
which existed before the crisis could be restored.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian reports said that more Israeli tanks were deployed
throughout the West Bank around Palestinian towns and villages
over the past two days, and even in Jerusalem, army lorries toting
heavy weapons were seen moving up the road outside the Jaffa Gate
of the Old City.
</P>
<P>
According to an Israeli army's contingency plan, which is
now known as "Field of Thorns," the army is prepared to
re-occupy Palestinian-controlled areas should the situation
deteriorate.

application by Delhi Police Commissioner Nikhil Kumar, seeking a
change in the venue of the trial because of terrorist threat to
the former prime minister.
</P>
<P>
After hearing the application, the apex court passed a brief
interim order saying that "in view of the serious situation spelt
out, it had become absolutely imperative for the court to act
immediately and pass an interim order" exempting Rao from personal
appearance.

the order will continue to be effective till October 7 when the
apex court will consider the application by the police
commissioner in detail, according to the PTI report.

in the case by the Delhi court, which was scheduled for this
morning, has been adjourned till this afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Security Chief: Violent Response to Tunnel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The Chief of Israel's
General Security Service, Ami Ayalon, has admitted that the GSS
had not foreseen such serious consequences from the opening of
the archaeological tunnel close to the Moslem holy site of Temple
Mount, reported Israel Radio today.
</P>
<P>
Ayalon told the Knesset (parliament) Foreign Affairs and
Defense Committee in a late night meeting Sunday in Tel Aviv that
 "there were two other breakdown scenarios, both less
serious. Now we are checking where we went wrong."
</P>
<P>
GSS and the police participated in the discussions preceding
the opening of the tunnel exit. Head of the Army Central Command
Major General Uzi Dayan and the government coordinator in the
Palestinian Territories, Major General Oren Shahor, were not
invited to the discussions.
</P>
<P>
According to Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert, Chief of the
General Staff Lieutenant General Amnon Lipkin-Shahak was also
absent from the meeting presided over by Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Criticism for the timing of the tunnel opening has also come
from Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai and senior Likud
members. But Netanyahu angrily responded at the press conference
Friday that he does not regret the opening of the tunnel.
</P>
<P>
Ayalon told the committee members that the use of tanks and
helicopters played a role in calming the situation.
</P>
<P>
Member of Knesset (MK) Yossi Sarid, leader of left party
Meretz, and MK Uzi Baram of Labor spoke at the meeting calling
for the establishment of a state commission to inquire into the
matter.

<HEADLINE> South Korea to Allow Domestic Small Firms to Borrow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 30 (Xinhua) -- South Korea will allow its
non-manufacturing small enterprises to borrow money from foreign
banks to finance capital good imports from next month, the Finance
and Economy Ministry said here today.
</P>
<P>
No yearly limits will be imposed on the amount of such foreign
bank loans if the borrowers meet the requirements for use of the
loans and terms of payment, according to the revised guidelines on
foreign commercial loans released by the ministry.
</P>
<P>
The upper interest rate ceiling on such loans, set as a
requirement for the loans, will be raised from the level of London
Inter-Bank Offered (LIBO) rate plus one percentage point to the
LIBO-plus-two-percentage-point level.
</P>
<P>
However, small firms affiliated with large business groups or
running a health club or golf course will continue to be
disqualified from receiving foreign bank loans, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Under the new guidelines, foreign-invested firms where foreign
investors have a stake of more than 50 percent will be allowed to
secure foreign loans equivalent up to the foreign stake to finance
imports of capital goods beginning next year.
</P>
<P>
Also starting from next year, all companies, regardless of the
amount of capital, will be allowed to introduce foreign loans to
repay their outstanding foreign loans. The limit on the amount of
such loans, now set at 90 percent of the outstanding loans, will
be lifted altogether.
</P>
<P>
Big high-tech firms will be also allowed next year to introduce
foreign loans to finance imports of capital goods.
</P>
<P>
The new guidelines will prompt small firms to introduce 200
million to 300 million U.S. dollars in additional foreign loans
and big high-tech firms to introduce new foreign loans totaling
two to three billion U.S. dollars next year, the ministry said.

<HEADLINE> Boost of Export Trade Stressed in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Zambia needs to boost its
export to make economic liberalization more meaningful.
</P>
<P>
This has been stressed by Bank of Zambia (the central bank)
Deputy Governor Situmbeko Musokotwane, the "Zambia Daily Mail"
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Exports could act as an engine to propel economy forward,
Musokotwane said at the annual general meeting of the Zambia
Association of Chambers of Commerce and Industry that was held
recently.
</P>
<P>
Howerve, he noted, during the past decade or so, the influential
intellectual thoughts in this direction were dominated by so-called
exports pessimists.
</P>
<P>
As a result, some African countries stopped producing even
primary commodities such as the groundnut pyramids of Nigeria,
while west Africa including Ghana falling behind Latin America in
the production of coccoa, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
In the case of Zambia, copper production slumped to less than
what it was 20 years ago with tobacco production also falling
back where neighboring countries were forging ahead in the
production of this commodity and many others like maize, tea and
coffee, the official pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He said lots of investments are needed in areas that have
potential for export in the country.

<HEADLINE> Australia Cuts Current Account Deficit by 30 Pct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Australia recorded a 30
percent improvement in its current account deficit in the year to
the end of August, despite the third consecutive deterioration in
the external accounts.
</P>
<P>
Assistant Treasurer Jim Short said in a statement issued here
today, "The current account deficit for the year ending August
1996 was 8.1 billion Australian dollars (6.4 billion US dollars)
or 30 percent lower than for the corresponding period a year
earlier."
</P>
<P>
Balance of payments figures for August released this morning
showed the current account deficit widened to 1.33 billion
Australian dollars (1.05 billion US dollars), seasonally adjusted,
from 1.2 billion Australian dollars (0.95 billion US dollars) in
July.
</P>
<P>
But Short pointed to the improvement in the external accounts
during the 12-month period. He said the decline in the current
account deficit reflected a 7.4 billion Australian dollars (5.85
billion US dollars) improvement in Australia's merchandise trade
position.
</P>
<P>
A turnaround in net services from a 1.2 billion Australian
dollars (0.95 billion US dollars) deficit to a 300 million
Australian dollars (237 million US dollars) surplus also
contributed to the improvement in the current account deficit, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Deadline for Foul Factories </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Today is the deadline for
China's tens of thousands of small factories which have been
forced by the government to close down, according to China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The National Environmental Protection Agency (Nepa) has sent
inspection teams to every province, autonomous region and
municipality to see that the State Council's decree is complied
with, said Xie Zhenhua, Nepa's director.
</P>
<P>
The small factories, which are maily owned by villages and
towships, have been ordered to close down for their discharge of
untreated waste from a variety of industries involved in paper
pulp-making, leather processing and dyestuff production.
</P>
<P>
These factories were blacklisted because of their primitive
manufacturing techniques and equipment, excessive use of resources
and damage to the environment, said Liu Yukai, a senior official
of the Natural Conservation Department of Nepa.
</P>
<P>
The further development of these factories does not accord with
the industries' trend of modernization which emphasizes economy
and efficiency, Liu said, adding, "When a small chemical plant or
paper-making mill pollutes a river, it endangers the crucial water
supply of people, not only in the rural areas, but also in the big
cities."
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the small factories are short of capital, and find
that it is not economical for them to set up waste water
treatment facilities.
</P>
<P>
The current crackdown on these factories reflects the State
Council's determination to control worsening pollution in the
country, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
Also, the determination and efforts of local governments are
vital in the final shutdown of the factories, said Wang Suli,
another official with Nepa.
</P>
<P>
So far, most of the provincial governments had made it clear
that the officials in charge and the factory directors would be
blamed if the closures were not completed on time.
</P>
<P>
Xie ruled out the possibility that the local economy would be
greatly affected by the crackdown on polluting enterprises. In
Henan, a province in Central China, the closure of the 1,461
paper-making mills affected only two percent of the province's
economy.

<HEADLINE> Forests' Decrease Alarming in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's forests are
decreasing by five percent each year as trees are cut for
agricultural, industrial and domestic purposes, the " Daily
Herald" reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to a data analysis from satellits,between 1977 and
1992, forest cover decreased by 76 percent.
</P>
<P>
The natural resources board cited land clearing for
agricultural and building purposes, the need for firewood and
cutting of trees for industrial purposes as the major reasons for
the current deforestation.
</P>
<P>
The board said when the study began in 1977, more than 43,800
hectares of land had trees. The tree cover decreased to less
than 10,300 in 1992, showing a 76.6 percent decrease.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's tree planting program has to achieve a more than
five percent afforestation rate each year if the environment is
to be maintained in its present state, said the board.

<HEADLINE> China Announces New Regulations for City Road Management </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 30 (Xinhua) -- China will put a new
set of regulations on road management into effect tomorrow to
ease the traffic problems in Chinese cities, said today's China
Daily.
</P>
<P>
The 45-article document is the first of its kind issued by the
State Council, according to Lin Jianing, director of the Urban
Construction Department with the Ministry of Construction.
</P>
<P>
Lin said over the weekend that the regulations were expected to
alleviate the following problems: fund shortage in building urban
roads, poor road conditions because of inadequate maintenance,
repair and management; and insufficient parking lots and other
facilities.
</P>
<P>
In addition to guidelines in road planning, contruction,
maintenance, repair and mangement in china's more than 600 cities,
the regulations also state how those who break the regulations
will be punished.
</P>
<P>
Although the length of urban roads in China has increased at an
annual rate of about five percent in recent years and has exceeded
130,000 km, Lin said, the average road space of each urban
resident was only 7.2 sq m, far less than the 20-30 sq m per
capita in developed countries.
</P>
<P>
Also, the annual growth rate of urban roads does not match the
10-15 percent annual growth rate in the amount of automobiles in
Chinese cities, Lin added.
</P>
<P>
The new regulations encourage fund raising through various
channels, rather than through government investment only.
</P>
<P>
The government welcomes overseas enterprises, organizations and
individuals to invest in urban road construction, in accordance
with the development plans about roads in specific Chinese cities,
the regulations say.
</P>
<P>
So far, overseas funds have been successfully used in the cities
like Tianjin and Shanghai to build roads and other public
transportation facilities, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
Underground pipelines for water, drainage, gas, heat,
electricity and telecommunications should be established in
harmony with the construction and development of urban roads to
avoid interrupting the normal traffic flow as much as possible.
</P>
<P>
Major roads may not be dug up within three or five years after
they were built or renovated without the approval of urban
engineering authorities, the regulations say.
</P>
<P>
The regulations also forbid commercial stalls, factories or
warehouses from blocking roads or occupying space on roads.

<P>
BANGKOK, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's Palang Dharma
(Virtue Force) Party (PDP) leader Thaksin Shinawatra believed that
widespread practices of vote-buying would remain as usual in the
forthcoming general election.
</P>
<P>
"Only money would draw the votes," he told reporters Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He added that politicians would continue to walk the "three
steps of Thai-style politics" in the current election climate.

He said that they would first buy votes and return favors to
their financiers and supporters, they would then look for ways to
secure money for future elections, and thirdly, they would only
deal with immediate problems.
</P>
<P>
He said it would be a long time before politicians started
solving national problems that have been accumulating for many
years.

<HEADLINE> Nepal to Eradicate Polio Early Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali government is
preparing to launch a nationwide anti-polio campaign later this
year in an effort to eradicate the crippling disease among
children in the country.
</P>
<P>
The National Immunization Program Against Polio, to be
conducted on December 6 this year and January 17, 1997, will
benefit about 3.3 million children under age of five throughout
the country, health officials said.
</P>
<P>
The program, with an estimated cost of more than 120 million
rupees (over 2 million US dollars), will mobilize at least 60,000
health workers and volunteers in the country's 75 districts to
administer anti-polio drops to the children, they said.
</P>
<P>
Polio, which often cripples the lower limbs of little children,
strikes some 100 to 200 Nepali children every year.
</P>
<P>
A meeting of the National Anti-polio Immunization Program
Steering Committee held here Sunday kicked off the campaign
formally when Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba called on the
nation to make the immunization days a success.
</P>
<P>
The campaign, largely funded by the World Health Organization
(WHO) and several donor agencies, is expected to help the country
eradicate polio, officials said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Nepal is the last country in the world to
implement the WHO-prescribed program of anti-polio "national

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Expected to Export More Rice in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam will export more rice
this year after a record 29 million-ton food harvest, according to
Vietnamese General Department of Statistics (GDS).
</P>
<P>
The local media reported today that with the harvest,
Vietnamese rice exporters will be able sell more than the trade
ministry-fixed quota of two million tons for the year.
</P>
<P>
The predicted 29 million tons of food would represent a 5.2
percent increase compared with the figure of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The output of rice, Vietnam's staple food, will reach 26.3
million tons, 1.4 million tons more than that of last year.
</P>
<P>
The GDS prediction is based on the bumper rice crop of the
1995-1996 winter-spring crop which was harvested early this year,
minus estimated storm losses of about 0.4 million tons from the
current rice crop which will be harvested in November.
</P>
<P>
According to the trade ministry, up to 1.9 million tons of rice
have already been exported in the first eight months of this
year. The higher rice outputs have made it possible for exporters
to sell more rice than the fixed quota.

that he will emerge the prime minister after the November 17
general election.
</P>
<P>
This came only two days after Banharn Silpa-archa dissolved the
House of Representatives last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Chavalit, whose main political stronghold is predominantly
agricultural northeastern provinces, said Sunday that his party's
policy will focus on distributing wealth to people at all economic
levels, instead of taking care only of those at higher levels.
</P>
<P>
"I will make all coaches of the whole train move in support of
each other. I will also be responsible to the poor and the middle
class," he said outlining his election platform.
</P>
<P>
Talking of plans to deal with the country's economic downturn,
he said that he would bring into his cabinet capable expert
economists from other political parties and that he did not expect
his requests would be rejected.
</P>
<P>
Chavalit, who hopes to rally about 120 sitting MPs to stand as
candidates under the NAP banner, said his party expected to win
the most House seats in the election.
</P>
<P>
In the just dissolved House, the NAP had 57 seats, the third
largest after the Chart Thai (Thai Nation, 91 seats) and the

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Sri Lankan Troops Recapture Kilinochchi Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 30 (Xinhua)-- Sri Lankan forces routed
rebels of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and captured
their last remaining bastion of Kilinochchi town after a fierce
seven-day battle Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
The rebels had shifted their headquarters to Kilinochchi town
last December after their "capital" in heartland Jaffna Peninsula
fell to the government forces.
</P>
<P>
Kilinochchi, a town immediately south of the Jaffna Peninsula,
about 255 kilometers from Colombo, holds a strategic position on
the main highway between Northern province and the mainland.
</P>
<P>
The rebels had prepared an alternative base there when it
became imminent to them that the Jaffna Peninsula was about to
fall. They had all facilities including a hospital for the
wounded.
</P>
<P>
Now the rebels have lost their last main base and have no
alternative but to retreat to the surrounding jungles, according
to military sources.
</P>
<P>
The last massive assault, code-named Sathjaya (certain victory)
III, drew thousands of heavily armed infantrymen from several
divisions  backed by artillery, tanks and air cover. The navy
helped keep the rebels at bay at the Jaffna Lagoon and North
coast.
</P>
<P>
This phase of the operation started on September 23 from
Paranthan, six kilometers to the north, which the forces had
earlier captured. The troops made rapid progress in two flanks
amidst fierce enemy resistance to reach Kilinochchi in seven days.
</P>
<P>
According to military sources, the troops are now in the middle
of Kilinochchi town and are setting up their own defenses.
</P>
<P>
The seven days saw some of the bloodiest fighting between the
government forces and the rebels this year as the latter tried to
resist the advancing columns of soldiers, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The troops repulsed all counter attacks and claimed to leave an
estimated 800 rebels killed and over 1,000 wounded.
</P>
<P>
The military lost 250 soldiers while a further 300 were
wounded. Civilian casualties have been placed at 20. Most
civilians had left for safer places as advised by the armed
forces.
</P>
<P>
The heavy casualties indicates the scale of the fighting . The
rebels were desperate to hold on to Kilinochchi as they had no
other fall-back town as their headquarters. Their resistance was
therefore fierce, the sources explained.
</P>
<P>
As the troops began to close in on Kilinochchi after opening a
third flank the rebels sent frantic messages to their cadres to
summon all their resources to prevent the collapse of the town
which was their political headquarters and medical center.
</P>
<P>
The rebels destroyed the telecommunications tower at
Kilinochchi and other items of use which they did not want to
leave to the advancing troops, indicative of their intention to
retreat to the neighboring jungles.
</P>
<P>
With the fall of Kilinochchi the security forces are now in
control of the key areas and access routes to Northern province
including the rebels previous stronghold, the Jaffna Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The rebels who have moved out into the jungles are now
reportedly forcing civilians in neighboring villages also to move
further south in an effort to set up another line of defense.
</P>
<P>
The rebels have been waging a 13-year-old war for a separate
state. A total of 55,000 people have died during this period. On
two occasions peace talks were reneged by them and the war
continued.
</P>
<P>
The present government of Chandrika Kumaratunga while offering
a political package has continued its military offensive against
the rebels but has pledged protection for the Tamil civilian
population.
</P>
<P>
The sources added, "We have nothing against the Tamil community
but we cannot allow the LTTE rebels to have their own way."

<HEADLINE> IMF, World Bank Hold Positive Views On Economic Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The Interim Committee of
the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank ended its 47th
meeting here today with positive views on the world economic
situation this year and next year.
</P>
<P>
A communique issued at the end of the one-day meeting says that
the committee welcomed "the generally encouraging world economic
and financial situation and prospects for a strengthening and
broadening of the economic expansion in 1996 and 1997."
</P>
<P>
According to the communique, the committee praised the
"increasingly significant role" played by the developing countries
in generating growth and expanding trade.
</P>
<P>
"The performance of many Asian countries remains impressive:
in a number of cases, moderating growth is helping to alleviate
inflationary pressures," the communique says.
</P>
<P>
It says that the number of African countries which have
improved the per capita incomes and growth prospects is
"increasing," although serious problems remain in the continent.
</P>
<P>
Many latin American countries are recovering and experiencing
lower inflation, after the difficulties associated with the
Mexican crisis, it says.
</P>
<P>
It notes that strengthened adjustment efforts have enhanced
growth prospects in several countries in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
It says in the transition countries, continued implementation
of broad-based reforms is expected to lead to a further
strengthening of growth performance, and inflation, though still
high, is declining.
</P>
<P>
It also points out that economic situation has also improved in
industrialized countries with inflation being subdued.
</P>
<P>
Sound expansion of output and employment has continued in the
United states and some other countries; Japan's recovery is more
firmly established; and in western Europe, the standstill in
growth ended and conditions are now in place for a resumption of
more satisfactory growth, it says.
</P>
<P>
The communique says that the favorable developments in the
world economy reflect the implementation by many countries of
policies consistent with the common strategy set out in the
October 1994 Madrid Declaration on Cooperation to Strengthen the
Global Expansion.
</P>
<P>
It says the Committee warmly endorsed the program of action
proposed by the Fund and the Bank to ensure that the heavily
indebted poor countries (HIPCs) that have shown a sound track
record of economic adjustment can attain a sustainable debt
situation over the medium term.

<HEADLINE> China's Foreign Trade Grows Rapidly (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Exports from such companies came to 46.9 billion dollars, six
times the figure for 1990, and 31.5 percent of total exports.
</P>
<P>
Trade with ten major trading partners, Japan, Hong
Kong, the United States, the European Union, Taiwan, the Republic
of Korea, Singapore, Russia, Canada and Australia, accounted for
86.5 percent of China's trade with the rest of the world in 1995,
up two percentage points from 1990.
</P>
<P>
The volume of trade between China and north America almost
doubled during the 1991-95 period, and the ratio of trade with
north America to China's total trade volume rose to 17.6 percent
in 1995, from nine percent in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Rapid growth of imports and exports have spurred rapid growth
of China's economy as a whole, he noted.
</P>
<P>
During the 1991-1995 period, China's gross domestic product
(the value of goods and services produced) -- rose at an annual
rate of 11.6 percent, and its industrial output value at an annual
rate of 23 percent.
</P>
<P>
Feng attributed the rapid growth of China's foreign trade to
the implementation of the policy of reform and opening up, the
rapid expansion of production and transport services, the reform
of the foreign trade managerial systems, and a favorable global
market environment.
</P>
<P>
Exports from China are expected to grow at an annual rate of 12
percent over the next five years, he said.
</P>
<P>
To attain the goal it is imperative to make sure that foreign
trade companies enjoy full authority in handling imports and
exports, he said.
</P>
<P>
It is also necessary to eliminate local protectionism,
encourage foreign trade companies to shift to large scale
operations, and increase the competitiveness of industries with a
high technological content, such as machinery, electronics,
automobiles, chemicals and pharmaceuticals.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav FM Says Sanctions to Be Lifted Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav Foreign Minister
Milan Milutinovic said today that his country was regarded as a
key factor in the regional peace process and the lifting of
sanctions against Yugoslavia was expected in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
Milutinovic, who stayed in the United Nations headquarters in
New York for the past week, held meetings with some 15 prominent
diplomats of important countries and institutions on bilateral and
regional issues.
</P>
<P>
They all confirmed Yugoslavia's positive and important role in
the region and "that is why I hope we shall witness the definite
and formal lifting of the sanctions very early next week,"
Milutinovic told Serbian television's news program.
</P>
<P>
Under the Dayton agreement, the total lifting of sanctions
would automatically take effect 10 days after the elections in
Bosnia. But the United Nations has recently said the sanctions
would be lifted only after the elections were verified by the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). The
OSCE verified the general elections today.
</P>
<P>
Talking about future cooperation with European Union countries,
Milutinovic said that at his talks with diplomats of western
European countries, he had been given understanding and support on
Yugoslavia's efforts to join the EU.
</P>
<P>
"Certainly, the meetings would result in better cooperation
with the European Union as a whole, because we have had excellent
political relations with each of the EU member states," he said.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the normalization of diplomatic relations with the
United States, Milutinovic said his meeting with U.S. Secretary of
State Warren Christopher had focused on many important issues
concerning the current situation in former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"We spoke in principle on bilateral relations and I shall be in
Washington next week for more extensive talks on all issues which
lead to the full normalization of relations, full in the sense of
an exchange of ambassadors," said Milutinovic.
</P>
<P>
So far, the United States has yet to recognize the rump
Yugoslavia, which is comprised of Serbia and Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the prospect of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Milutinovic
said things would not be the same in that country after the
elections.
</P>
<P>
"New leaderships have been elected. They have their legitimacy,
and they also have a great responsibility toward their voters to
make life in Bosnia and each of its entities better so that the
people can feel a real and essential change with comparison with
the former situation," the foreign minister added.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Official Dissatisfied with UN Resolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Ambassador to the
Cairo-based Arab League Mohamed Sobeih today expressed his
dissatisfaction with the U.N. resolution on the deteriorating
conditions in the Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
Sobeih described the resolution passed late Saturday as "
watered-down," according to the Egypt's news agency MENA.
</P>
<P>
The resolution was incongruous with the Israel's violation of
all international resolutions on Jerusalem, he was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The resolution did not directly call on Israel to close a
tunnel that triggered clashes between the Palestinians and Israeli
troops.
</P>
<P>
The opening of the tunnel near Al Aqsa Mosque, Islam's third
holiest shrine, led to gun-battles and rioting that have left over
70 people dead in the past few days.
</P>
<P>
The resolution only calls for an "immediate cessation and reversal
of all acts which have resulted in the aggravation of the
situation."
