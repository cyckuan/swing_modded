MILLER JOINS MNF TEAM IN FUNNY DECISION
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Are you ready for some football, cha cha?
</P>
<P>
   Ending months of wild speculation about who would join Al
Michaels in the ``Monday Night Football'' booth, ABC revealed
Thursday that the wild guessing was justified as comedian Dennis
Miller emerged as the anointed one for one of the nation's most
high-profile sports TV positions.
</P>
<P>
   Also added to the broadcast team as an analyst is former NFL
quarterback great Dan Fouts. The new sideline reporters are former
Rams star and Hall of Famer Eric Dickerson, a longtime resident of
Calabasas, and ESPN's Melissa Stark, replacing Leslie Visser.
</P>
<P>
   Even though ``Monday Night Football'' finished third in
prime-time ratings overall last season, viewership has slipped the
past five seasons to a record low 13.7 points last season when
Michaels did the broadcast with former NFL quarterback Boomer
Esiason. The ratings had been up to 17.8 when Michaels worked with
former players Dan Dierdorf and Frank Gifford in 1994. A rating
point represents 1 percent of U.S. TV homes.
</P>
<P>
   But a year after Dierdorf and Gifford were let go, Esiason also
was released. Don Ohlmeyer, who guided ``Monday Night Football''
during its Howard Cosell-led heyday in the 1970s, was rehired in
March as the show's producer.
</P>
<P>
   Industry talk of who would work with Michaels and put a new
spark into the 27-year-old series ranged from conservative radio
talk-show host Rush Limbaugh to sports-talk host Jim Rome.
</P>
<P>
   Even Gifford's wife _ morning TV host Kathie Lee Gifford _ had
been mentioned as a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Miller, the former anchor of ``Weekend Update'' on
NBC's ``Saturday Night Live'' and now host of his own show on
cable's HBO, who was at the top of Ohlmeyer's list of potential
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   After an audition with Michaels 2 weeks ago in Los Angeles,
Miller remained Ohlmeyer's top choice and was signed to a
undisclosed contract Thursday morning before the announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think at the time he'd be interested or capable of
doing it,'' Ohlmeyer said. ``About four or five weeks ago, he let
us know he was interested. He did the tape with Al, and the rest of
it is history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expected to be entertained by Dennis and Al, which I was,
but I was knocked out by the observations he made. He brought a
fresh way of doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller said he thought his tryout went well, but he wasn't sure
if it was what Ohlmeyer wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll do the best I can to be me. I think it'll play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to get across that I know football. I won't ever try to
question anything like a player's fortitude. I'll try to stay in
the background and not pontificate on what someone should be or
shouldn't be. I'm a little odd and idiosyncratic with some quirky
ability.''
</P>
<P>
   Michaels, entering his 15th year as the show's play-by-play
announcer, gave Miller his stamp of approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew having watched him for years that he was very
perceptive. I walked out of that audition thinking he knew as much
about the National Football League as anyone brought in or I talked
to in the last several years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was completely up to speed. I walked out during a break and
we (he and Ohlmeyer) looked at each other and we were completely
speechless. It wasn't something either of us expected.''
</P>
<P>
   Ohlmeyer said the audience will decide whether Miller's acerbic
approach works, but noted that ``football is a serious game, but
it's not played in St. Patrick's Cathedral. People want to watch
football and have an enjoyable time. We make the game relevant to
the hard-core fan, acceptable to the occasional fan and
unpredictable to both. This announcing team I think will be
unpredictable.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickerson, who has little broadcasting experience, said he is
``grateful for the opportunity'' and that ``unlike Dennis, I do
know football a little better. I know how players think. I'll have
different insight from the guys in the booth.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as long as it gets viewers talking about the show the way
they did when Cosell reigned with ``Dandy'' Don Meredith and
Gifford decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of creating a buzz _ there's nothing wrong with
that,'' Ohlmeyer said. ``There will probably be a buzz about this
(hiring) for a while, but I don't think we created anything just
for the buzz.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this doesn't work out, no amount of buzz will save us.''

CLUBHOUSE CERTAIN HOT STREAK WILL COME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ It's no time to panic. Not now, not yet.
</P>
<P>
   That's the mindset in the Anaheim Angels clubhouse, even though
they went into Thursday's game a season-high five games behind
Oakland in the AL West.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels have hovered around the .500 mark all season long.
They haven't been more than three games over .500 and haven't been
more than two games below .500. They've stayed close to the top of
the division until a recent hot streak by the A's. Only a week ago,
they were 2 games out.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels have not lost more than three games in a row this
season, but they also haven't won more than three in a row. In
order to make a run at Oakland and Seattle, the Angels know they
have to put together a significant winning streak. But when?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's a sense of urgency,'' left fielder Darin
Erstad said. ``If you've watched us play enough, you know we
haven't clicked as a whole like Seattle and Oakland. We're
confident that's coming soon and it would be better now than later.
When we do that, we're going to win a lot of ballgames.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Not ready yet: With all the shuffling of pitchers between
Triple-A Edmonton and the Angels' big-league club this season, one
pitcher has been absent.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Ortiz began the season in the starting rotation and went
2-2 with a 6.90 ERA in six starts. Because of his inconsistency and
lack of command of his pitches, he was sent to Edmonton on May 10.
Even though he's been working on correcting his problems for nearly
six weeks, he's not ready to come back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ramon's command is better and he's making progress,'' Angels
manager Mike Scioscia said. ``He's a guy we all were excited about
and we're still excited about.''
</P>
<P>
   But will he rejoin the team before Sept. 1, when rosters can be
expanded?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely a possibility,'' Scioscia said. ``But we need
to see him put together a string of starts showing that
consistency. I don't think he's quite ready right now.''
</P>
<P>
   In eight starts at Edmonton, Ortiz is 2-3 with a 5.49 ERA.

 By LESLIE MOORE 
 c.2000 Latin Trade 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    MEXICO CITY _ Mexican tortilla company Minsa has come a long
way. In seven years, it has gone from a sleepy government-owned
enterprise to a publicly owned concern. It's expanded its market
share from 8 percent to 25 percent against tortilla-making giant
Grupo Maseca by offering tortillerias incentives _ such as new
tortilla-making equipment _ to switch brands. It now aims to gain 1
percent to 2 percent market share every year.
 &HT;    Last November, its efforts won attention from Dallas-based
private equity firm Hicks, Muse, Tate &AMP; Furst, which bought a 32.5
percent stake in the company for $68 million, gaining five seats on
its 11-member board of directors. The investment will allow Minsa
to pay down some of its expensive peso debt.
 &HT;    But this is presidential election time in Mexico, and almost
anything that can happen usually does. In Minsa's case, it's meant
a rain of cheap corn imports, which has all but halted its revenue
growth.
 &HT;    What does corn have to do with politics? Despite strong,
year-round corn harvests, Mexico allowed record amounts of the crop
to be imported into the country last year, which deflated its
price. Corn is the main ingredient in tortillas, and low corn
prices mean low tortilla prices. Allowing more corn to be imported
than is needed is seen as a political effort to keep tortilla
prices low after the government phase-out of tortilla subsidies
early last year _ and presumably keep the Mexican electorate
supine.
 &HT;    Whether it's government maneuvering or mere market forces at
work, tortilla producers have been hit hard _ Minsa in particular.
Minsa sells a corn flour mix. But with the lower prices,
mom-and-pop tortilla shops around the country have used more
corn-based tortilla mix instead of corn flour-based products,
making Minsa's revenues fall flat.
 &HT;    Indeed, Minsa's sales volume dropped by more than a fifth to
$500 million pesos _ roughly US$50 million _ during the third
quarter last year compared to the same period in 1998. In a
statement, Minsa admitted that low corn prices ``significantly
affected'' its third quarter sales. ``While the company anticipated
that the market would stabilize by mid-year 1999, this has not yet
occurred due to imports,'' the company said.
 &HT;    Few openly point to political motives as the cause of cheap corn
_ least of all Minsa executives, who politely skirt the issue.
``Overall, the transition to a subsidy-free market has been
smooth,'' says Juan Gargallo, Minsa's president and chief executive
officer. As for corn imports, the opening ``was a precautionary
measure to avoid tortilla prices from skyrocketing,'' he says.
 &HT;    The Mexican Commerce Secretariat (Secofi), which is charged with
dispensing corn import permits, did not return phone calls from
latin trade seeking comment about its corn import policies. But
Rolando Calderon, an analyst who covers tortilla companies Minsa
and Maseca for Santander Investment, thinks it was an intentional
move by Secofi with the unfortunate side effect of hurting Mexican
tortilla makers. ``It's an oversupply with the intention of
avoiding price increases in corn and tortillas,'' he says. ``With
the cheap corn prices, Minsa or Maseca can't recuperate their
prices.''
 &HT;    Tortillas, a main diet staple of approximately 45 million poor
Mexicans, have often been a common ground between political and
business interests. For example, Mexican political boss Carlos Hank
Gonzalez, who was agricultural minister under President Carlos
Salinas de Gortari, is perceived as enjoying an important role in
Maseca: His son is married to the daughter of key shareholder and
president Roberto Gonzalez.
 &HT;    How tortilla politics may change after the July election is not
known. So far, mainline politicians have remained mum on the issue.
Francisco Labastida, the leading presidential candidate from the
71-year ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), has ``no
policies on tortilla'' prices, according to his spokesperson, Rosa
Elba Arroyo.
 &HT;    But some observers predict corn prices will probably rise after
the election, along with tortilla prices. Tortilla consumers will
be the losers, and tortilla companies such as Minsa and Maseca _ as
well as their investors _ will be the winners.
 &HT;    Charles Tate, a partner in Minsa's new investor, Hicks, Muse,
Tate &AMP; Furst, is willing to wait it out. ``It's a good industry to
be in,'' Tate says. ``It's one of only two [dominant tortilla
producers. It's a real basic business in Mexico and I don't think
you ever run the risk of it going out of business.'' That is,
unless the government pulls the rug out from under you.

 &HT;    CIUDAD DE MEXICO _ La compania mexicana de tortillas Minsa ha
avanzado mucho. En siete anos, ha pasado de ser una sonolienta
firma estatal a una empresa cotizada en bolsa. Ha aumentado su
participacion de mercado del 8 por ciento al 25 por ciento contra
el coloso Grupo Maseca ofreciendo incentivos a las tortillerias
para que cambien de marca. Ahora apunta a ganar una participacion
de mercado de entre el 1 por ciento y el 2 por ciento anual.
 &HT;    En noviembre de 1999 sus esfuerzos atrajeron la atencion de la
firma privada de inversion Hicks, Muse, Tate &AMP; Furst, de Dallas,
que compro un interes del 32,5 por ciento por US$68 millones, y le
otorgo derecho a colocar a cinco de los 11 miembros del directorio.
La inversion permitira a Minsa pagar parte de su costosa deuda en
pesos.
 &HT;    Pero este ano hay elecciones presidenciales en Mexico y puede
pasar casi cualquier cosa. En el caso de Minsa, ha habido una ola
de maiz importado barato, que practicamente ha paralizado el
crecimiento de sus ingresos.
 &HT;    Que tiene que ver el maiz con la politica? A pesar de la
abundante cosecha, el gobierno mexicano permitio la importacion de
cantidades record de maiz en 1999, lo que hizo bajar los precios
del producto, y por consiguiente de las tortillas. Esto se
considera un esfuerzo politico por mantener bajo el precio de las
tortillas desde que el gobierno elimino el subsidio en 1999.
 &HT;    Los productores de tortillas se han visto muy afectados por las
maniobras del gobierno y por las fuerzas del mercado, sobre todo
Minsa, que fabrica una mezcla de harina de maiz. Al bajar los
precios del maiz, los pequenos procesadores de tortillas usan mas
la harina que la mezcla, y por consiguiente los ingresos de Minsa
se desplomaron.
 &HT;    En efecto, el volumen de ventas de Minsa bajo en mas de una
quinta parte, a US$500 millones de pesos (unos US$50 millones) en
el tercer trimestre de 1999, en comparacion con el mismo periodo de
1998. Minsa admitio que el bajo precio del maiz ``afecto
significativamente'' sus ventas del tercer trimestre. ``Aunque la
compania previo que el mercado se estabilizaria a mediados de 1999,
aun no ha ocurrido debido a las importaciones,'' agrego.
 &HT;    Pocos senalan abiertamente los motivos politicos como causa del
abaratamiento del maiz, y menos aun los ejecutivos de Minsa. ``En
general, la transicion a un mercado libre de subsidios ha sido sin
contratiempos,'' dice Juan Gargallo, presidente de Minsa. En cuanto
a las importaciones de maiz, la apertura ``fue una medida de
precaucion para evitar que el precio de la tortilla se disparara,''
afirma.
 &HT;    La Secretaria de Comercio y Fomento Industrial (Secofi) de
Mexico, que autoriza las importaciones de maiz, no devolvio varias
llamadas de Latin Trade. Pero Rolando Calderon, analista que
estudia el comportamiento de Minsa y Maseca para Santander
Investment, piensa que la decision de Secofi de autorizar la
importacion de maiz barato fue intencional, y que ello afecto a los
fabricantes de tortillas. ``Es un exceso de oferta con la intencion
de evitar un aumento de precio del maiz y las tortillas,'' apunta.
``Al abaratarse el maiz, ni Minsa ni Maseca pueden recuperar el
nivel anterior de sus precios.''
 &HT;    Las tortillas, que son el plato principal de unos 45 millones de
mexicanos de bajos ingresos, han sido muchas veces tema comun de
los intereses politicos y comerciales. Por ejemplo, se piensa que
el lider politico Carlos Hank Gonzalez, secretario de Agricultura
en el gobierno de Carlos Salinas de Gortari, tiene un papel
importante en Maseca: su hijo esta casado con la hija del
presidente e importante accionista de la compania, Roberto
Gonzalez.
 &HT;    No se sabe como la politica de la tortilla podra afectar las
elecciones de julio. Hasta ahora, los politicos de los mayores
partidos han guardado silencio ante el asunto. Francisco Labastida,
principal candidato por el Partido Revolucionario Institucional
(PRI), no se ha pronunciado oficialmente sobre el precio de la
tortilla, segun su portavoz Rosa Elba Arroyo.
 &HT;    Pero algunos pronostican que el precio del maiz probablemente
suba tras el sufragio, junto con el precio de la tortilla. Los
consumidores seran los perdedores, y los fabricantes como Minsa y
Maseca, y sus inversionistas, seran los triunfadores.
 &HT;    Charles Tate, socio de Hicks, Muse, Tate &AMP; Furst, el nuevo
inversionista de Minsa, esta dispuesto a esperar. ``Es un buen
sector,'' afirma. ``Es solo uno de dos productores principales de
tortilla. Es un negocio basico en Mexico y no creo que se corra el
riesgo de arruinarse.'' Es decir, a menos que el gobierno se
entrometa en el funcionamiento del mercado.

   UAW STRIKES BACK OVER CHINA
</P>
<P>
   The United Automobile Workers has retaliated against a longtime
friend who defied the union and supported the China trade bill. Not
only has the union decided against endorsing the longtime ally,
Rep. Sander Levin, D-Mich., but it has thrown its support behind
his Republican opponent, Bart Baron.
</P>
<P>
   The UAW and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters persuaded
the Michigan AFL-CIO to remain neutral, instead of supporting
Levin. Some labor leaders are criticizing the union arguing that if
a Republican is elected in the district, it will be harder for
Democrats to regain control of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   AN ALTERNATIVE TO TWO PARTIES
</P>
<P>
   A bipartisan coalition of advocacy groups and celebrities is
planning an alternative to the Republican and Democratic national
conventions in Philadelphia and Los Angeles this summer. The
coalition said its ``shadow conventions'' would highlight three
issues: the gap between rich and poor, campaign finance reform and
the ``failed'' war on drugs. Among those sponsoring the event are
Common Cause, Public Campaign and the syndicated columnist Arianna
Huffington. Those participating will include Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz.; the actors Warren Beatty and Ron Silver, the television
talk show host Bill Maher and the comedian Al Franken. The group
said the shadow conventions, to be broadcast on its Web site,
www.shadowconventions.com. will last for three days.
</P>
<P>
   A WILLING RUNNING MATE
</P>
<P>
   Most Democrats or Republicans feign modesty and decline to
comment substantively if they win speculative mention as a possible
vice-presidential choice. Not Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo. Asked
Thursday on a trip to Israel whether he would agree to be Al Gore's
running mate, if asked, he shot back in a New York second: Yes.Or,
Cuomo went on, he might follow in the footsteps of his father,
Mario, and run for governor of New York in 2002. Meanwhile, back in
Minnesota, Gore was asked how the search was progressing for a
running mate. ``Don't have a short list yet,'' he replied. FRIDAY'S

SEC LOOKS INTO LAZIO INVESTMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFFORD J. LEVY and FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating whether
Rep. Rick A. Lazio, the Republican candidate for Senate in New
York, violated insider trading laws when he made a nearly 600
percent profit in less than seven weeks by investing in securities
of a company controlled by some of his biggest campaign
contributors.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio released a statement Thursday night saying that the
commission had asked him for copies of ``account statements and
trading records.'' He said he would provide all information
requested and would answer any questions from the commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``I reiterate today what I stated last week, that there is no
incidence in my financial transactions that involve any
improprieties,'' he said. ``I have repeatedly conducted myself,
privately and publicly, with the highest degree of integrity and
professionalism.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission's inquiry seems to be at a preliminary stage, and
many such requests for information do not lead to charges.
</P>
<P>
   A commission spokesman, Chris Ullman, declined to comment. ``We
can neither confirm nor deny the existence of any investigation,''
Ullman said.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's campaign manager, Bill Dal Col, asserted that the
commission was undertaking the investigation at the behest of the
campaign of Lazio's Democratic opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Dal Col said the Clinton administration had a history of
``abusing federal authority'' for political purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Dal Col questioned why word of the inquiry surfaced on the same
day that the independent counsel, Robert W. Ray, announced that he
had found substantial evidence that Clinton had played a role in
the firings at the White House travel office, though he declined to
file charges.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Wolfson, a spokesman for Clinton, responded by saying
that ``desperate campaigns make desperate charges.''
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry appears to have been opened by the commission's
enforcement division, which is headed by Richard Walker, a lawyer
who joined the commission in 1991. The commission is composed of
five members appointed by the president and confirmed by the
Senate. No more than three members can be from one political party.
</P>
<P>
   One of Clinton's staunchest supporters, H. Carl McCall, the
state comptroller, called on the commission to investigate Lazio
earlier this week, citing an article about Lazio's investments in
The New York Times last Friday. But it appears that the commission
had begun its inquiry before being contacted by McCall.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio said last week that he did not have inside information
when he earned a profit of roughly $13,500 in 1997 from speculative
options trades in the stock of the company, Quick &AMP; Reilly, his
first such options purchase in his life.
</P>
<P>
   He said that he had merely made a wise bet and that he was a
modest investor who had had mixed luck in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio has declined to release his brokerage records or tax
returns, though his campaign says he will eventually release the
tax records. He reported the outlines of the Quick &AMP; Reilly trades
on disclosure forms that he is required to file with the House of
Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Salmans, a spokesman for Quick &AMP; Reilly, which was an
independent brokerage company before being acquired by the Fleet
Financial Group, declined to comment on whether Quick &AMP; Reilly
executives had been contacted by the SEC.
</P>
<P>
   Two members of the Quick family who have been executives at the
company, Peter and Christopher C. Quick, have said they did not
discuss the firm's stock with Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   Executives of Quick &AMP; Reilly have been among Lazio's biggest
supporters, having donated at least $35,000 to his congressional
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The largest contributor is a senior executive, Pascal J.
Mercurio, who along with his wife has given $7,750 to the
campaigns. The Mercurios live in Lazio's district in Suffolk
County.
</P>
<P>
   Reached by telephone last week, Mercurio hung up when asked
about his relationship with Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio first bought Quick &AMP; Reilly stock in early 1997 and then
added more shares in June 1997, on the same day Quick &AMP; Reilly
hired an investment banker to seek buyers.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Aug. 1 of that year, Lazio bought options on Quick &AMP;
Reilly stock _ prompted, he now says, by rumors that the company
might be a takeover target. On Monday, Aug. 4, in a transaction
that Lazio acknowledged last week but had failed to report on his
disclosure forms, he bought more options.
</P>
<P>
   He spent a total of $2,300 on the options, which are securities
that allow an investor to buy shares at a specified price for a
limited amount of time. If the price does not rise, the options
become worthless.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, on Aug. 11, news leaked out that the company had
hired investment bankers, and the prices of the stock and options
jumped. The company was later acquired by Fleet Financial.
</P>
<P>
   A review of public information and trading records shows that
speculation about Quick &AMP; Reilly being a takeover target had just
started to grow when Lazio made his first options purchase on Aug.
1.
</P>
<P>
   Total volume in options to buy Quick &AMP; Reilly stock came to
1,500 contracts on Aug. 1, nearly triple the volume of the previous
day, and 1,542 contracts the following Monday, according to figures
from the Options Clearing Corp., which overseas the settling of all
options trades.
</P>
<P>
   Both figures represented just a quarter of the activity on Aug.
12, when volume soared after news of the potential takeover
surfaced.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Microsoft and the government agreed Thursday on an
expedited schedule for submitting briefs to the Supreme Court that
will enable the court to decide whether to accept the antitrust
case as soon as late August.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson sent the case to the
Supreme Court for direct review under a little-used law known as
the Expediting Act.
</P>
<P>
   After that, using the normal rules, Microsoft and the government
would have had 90 days to file briefs and replies on the question
of whether the court should take the appeal or send it to the Court
of Appeals, pushing that decision into late September.
</P>
<P>
   But in a notice to the court, U.S. Solicitor General Seth P.
Waxman said that ``the parties have agreed to a briefing schedule''
under which the last brief would be filed on Aug. 22.
</P>
<P>
   If the Supreme Court decides to take the Microsoft appeal, then
the litigants will get another briefing schedule, this one on the
main issues in the case.

LANDRY'S LIFE CELEBRATED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICH HAMMOND  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WESTLAKE VILLAGE, Calif. _ Danny Villanueva spent only three
years under the famous watchful eyes of former Dallas Cowboys coach
Tom Landry, a period he fondly recalls as being one of the most
memorable of his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``He meant a lot to me, and everybody else who played for him,
because he taught us so much,'' said Villanueva, a resident of
nearby Camarillo and placekicker for the Cowboys 1965-67, who was
one of about 300 guests on hand Thursday night for ``A Tribute to
Tom Landry'' at the Hyatt Westlake Plaza.
</P>
<P>
   The event was presented by California Lutheran University, the
Thousand Oaks, Calif., campus where Landry and the Cowboys held
training camp before the start of every NFL season from 1963 to
1989.
</P>
<P>
   Landry, who coached the Cowboys for 29 years (1960-88), died in
February. Thursday's event, which included dinner, speeches and a
multimedia presentation, was a chance for family and friends to
remember and celebrate the coach's life and many achievements,
which included Super Bowl victories after the 1971 and 1977
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very lovely to come back here, where we had so many great
memories,'' said Alicia Landry, the coach's widow. ``We were able
to have lunch at the (Cal Lutheran) campus, and we walked by the
dorms where I visited Tom for so many years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was busy, working with the team, but we were always able to
spend some time together, and this has always been such a nice,
peaceful, beautiful area.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost every guest at the tribute had some connection to Landry,
including former players and recipients of the Landry Medal, given
by the university 18 times over the past 20 years to honor people
who ``are an inspiration to America's youth.'' Every guest also had
at least one Landry story to share.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I ever saw Tom,'' former longtime Cal Lutheran
football coach Robert Shoup said, ``he was standing ... by this
cliff that's pretty well known on campus, and he looked like George
Washington on Mount Rushmore.''
</P>
<P>
   Villanueva, one of the speakers at the event, recalled his first
encounter with Landry and the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still remember getting the phone call from the Rams, telling
me I had been traded,'' Villanueva said. ``I was sad to be leaving
Los Angeles, which had sort of become my adopted hometown.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the Rams told me I had been traded and they told me to
stay by the phone because Tom Landry and (former Cowboys president)
Tex Schramm would be calling. I talked to Tom and he made me feel a
lot better, because he told me that the Rams hadn't offered me
around but that he wanted me and had come after me. That made me
feel pretty good.
</P>
<P>
   ``And when I got to Cal Lutheran, it didn't take long for me to
realize that this was a team with a purpose, and that Tom really
had them ready to make a breakthrough.''
</P>
<P>
   A year later, Villanueva kicked a game-winning field goal in the
1966 regular-season finale, sending the Cowboys to the playoffs for
the first time in franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt so happy to be able to do that for Tom,'' Villanueva
said. ``Tom was like family to me, and for three years out there at
Cal Lutheran, my teammates were like family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw Tom last year at an awards dinner and we talked briefly,
but I never really got to thank him and tell him what he meant to
me. I regret that now, because he was a great man.''

   NEW-DANCERS (New York) _ What makes a dancer stand out from the

faces draw the eye. But stages are full of performers who fit the
prescibed notion of physical perfection. There are so many dancers
to claim the heart and mind and eye, yet only a few do each season.
Ease, physical eloquence and quiet daring are common denominators
among seven outstanding new or unfamiliar performers who will dance
this weekend in New York, as well as the three former Alvin Ailey
dancers whose new modern-dance troupe has made its debut this week
at the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival in the Berkshires. All occupy
the stage with a look of unassuming ownership. Each catches the eye
with something more than skill or physical beauty, an often elusive
quality that remains in the mind, like a flash of bright unexpected
color on a bustling city street, long after the curtain falls. By

I know well: Boston, Buffalo and Philadelphia. During those visits
I looked at them from the idiosyncratic standpoint of what had
become of their historic theaters, I also made a trip to Washington
to visit the nation's most famous and sacred historic theater,
Ford's; actually, it is a facsimile, as the original structure in
which Abraham Lincoln was assassinated was torn down. In the course
of these trips I learned much about the dynamics and histories of
the cities themselves. I saw the tremendous energy and sometimes
heartbreaking compromises necessary to maintain a performing-arts
center today. And I learned how intensely it is possible to love a
theater and to believe in a city, so much so that some people may
devote most of their adult lives, sometimes as volunteers, to
keeping an old theater alive. By Mindy Aloff.

   PHILLY-WARHOL-GWATHMEY (Philadelphia) _ Here's a stretch: one of
the more improbable pairings in recent exhibition history. It puts
the work of Andy Warhol (1928-1987) with that of the social realist
painter Robert Gwathmey (1903-1988), the idea being that the
under-appreciated Gwathmey and the canonized Warhol shared an
outlook as ``social commentators'' on American life. At the
Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, each is given a separate
show, ``Robert Gwathmey: Master Painter'' and ``Andy Warhol: Social
Observer.'' But each is meant to complement the other in this
ill-conceived double feature. The Academy's aim in mounting the two
together, it says, is nothing less than reshaping conceptions of
postwar American art. By Grace Glueck.

MUSEUM AND TRIBE REACH AGREEMENT ON METEORITE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ore.)   By JOHN SULLIVAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a compromise that seeks to balance scientific
inquiry with cultural tradition, the American Museum of Natural
History and an Indian group from Oregon have agreed that the
15.5-ton Willamette Meteorite will remain a centerpiece of the
museum's new center for earth and space.
</P>
<P>
   The brownish iron meteorite, the largest ever discovered in the
continental United States, will continue to rest on its steel
pedestal in the Cullman Hall of the Universe. But in addition to a
plaque describing the scientific background of the giant rock,
which scientists believe plummeted to earth 10,000 years ago from
the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, there will be a second
display describing its history and importance as a Native American
religious object.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen V. Futter, the museum's president, said the agreement was
``predicated on mutual recognition of, and respect for, the
traditions of both the tribe and the museum.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It constitutes, we think, an enlightened and constructive
resolution to a complicated and sensitive dispute,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of the meteorite, which has been on display at the
museum for nearly a century, was called into question early this
year when the Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde asked the
museum to surrender the meteorite under a law that calls for the
return of Native American artifacts from organizations that receive
federal money. The Confederated Tribes said that the meteorite held
great religious significance for its people.
</P>
<P>
   The museum asked the U.S. District Court in Manhattan to deny
the group's claims. In legal papers, the museum's lawyers said the
meteorite was a natural feature of the landscape and not a
religious object as defined by the Native American Graves
Protection and Repatriation Act of 1990. The museum bought the
meteorite in 1906 from the owner of the land where it was found,
the Oregon Iron and Steel Co., for $20,600.
</P>
<P>
   After several months of negotiations, which included an exchange
of visits by representatives of both sides, a compromise was
reached, avoiding what most likely would have been a lengthy and
expensive court battle. While the museum will keep the meteorite,
title to it will transfer to the Confederated Tribes if the museum
stops exhibiting the object, except for periodic restoration and
cleaning. The Confederated Tribes will also be allowed to schedule
ceremonial visits to the meteorite.
</P>
<P>
   Kathryn Harrison, chairwoman of the Indian group's Tribal
Council, said the agreement represented an important milestone in
the history of the Confederated Tribes, made up of tribes that
lived in western Oregon until the mid-19th century.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech announcing the agreement Thursday morning, Harrison
spoke of the history of the Confederated Tribes, describing a
forced relocation to government reservations that led to shrinking
lands and a scattered, dwindling population. The tribes'
independent identity officially ended with a government order in
1954, but she said members spent years fighting to have their name
restored. In 1983, Congress reinstated federal recognition, and
4,500 tribal members now live on a reservation southwest of
Portland.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison said the Confederated Tribes had to struggle to reclaim
its history and identity, and the meteorite is an important part of
the group's tradition. The Clackamas Indians held the meteorite to
be a sacred object and believed that a union occurred of the earth,
sky and water when it rested in the ground and rainwater collected
in its many folds and basins.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Confederated Tribes had sought the return of the
meteorite, Harrison said the group and the museum found common
ground in ``the search to see how the past came to be the
present.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the compromise would allow both sides to win: The
museum would keep the exhibit and the Confederated Tribes would be
able to keep its history. ``Now you know who we are, the
Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde,'' she said. ``We brought the
past with us.''

EDITORIAL: IRREVERSIBLE ERROR IN TEXAS 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, June 23:
</P>
<P>
   If there is one area in the American legal system where even a
single error cannot be tolerated, it is the administration of
capital punishment. This page has long opposed the death penalty on
the grounds that it is morally wrong and also unconstitutional as
being cruel and unusual. But even on procedural grounds the penalty
is hard to defend. The way it is meted out in this country is so
grossly arbitrary, so racially unfair and so full of legal mistakes
that there is no way to ensure that innocent people will be spared.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite convincing new evidence of the system's fallibility,
neither Gov. George W. Bush nor Vice President Al Gore has defended
his support of the death penalty in ways that confront the
intellectual, legal and moral issues raised by state-sponsored
killing.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation principles of a society in which citizens submit
to the rule of law are that the guilty will be subject to
proportional punishment and that the innocent will be vindicated
through a fair and rigorous legal process. But neither principle
can be said to govern how the American courts dispense death
sentences. New research on error rates in capital cases and the
successful use of DNA evidence to exonerate death row inmates in
recent years reveal the system to be even more flawed than
previously imagined.
</P>
<P>
   The execution of Gary Graham in Texas on Thursday night is a
dramatic case in point. There is powerful evidence that he did not
commit the murder for which the state put him to death. Graham,
represented at trial by a court-appointed lawyer who failed to
mount a meaningful defense, was convicted largely on the testimony
of a single witness who said she saw him from 30 to 40 feet away
through her car windshield. There was no physical evidence linking
Graham to the crime. Tests showed that the gun he was carrying was
not the murder weapon, and two other witnesses who were never
called to testify at trial said they had seen the killer, and it
was not Graham.
</P>
<P>
   Even for death penalty supporters, these facts should raise deep
doubts about this conviction. But Graham is dead now, and the
uncovering of further evidence that proves him innocent will not
bring him back.
</P>
<P>
   Bush did nothing to stop the Graham execution, but instead
defended his state's actions, telling reporters that ``as far as
I'm concerned there has not been one innocent person executed since
I've been governor.'' Bush has now presided over 135 executions. In
Illinois, Gov. George Ryan declared a moratorium on executions
after 13 death row inmates were exonerated, as compared with the 12
who had been executed since Illinois reinstated capital punishment
in 1977. It defies common sense to conclude that Texas, a state
with a notoriously weak public-defender system, could conduct such
a huge number of rapid executions without a single mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has a more nuanced position, but one that is also deeply
troubling. He was quoted this week by The Associated Press as
saying that ``if you are honest about the debate you have got to
acknowledge there are always going to be some small number of
errors.'' This chilling concession should rule out the use of
capital punishment entirely. Any wrongful execution is
constitutionally repugnant and erosive of the core values of
justice in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Gore does say that any state with a bad record of death penalty
errors should declare a moratorium. But his statements about
mistakes in the process seems to imply that there is some level of
error that would be socially tolerable. Gore and Bush present
themselves as leaders driven by moral principles. But by any moral
standard, there can be no margin for error when the state takes
human life.

STICKING WITH PEREZ
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ No longer do the Los Angeles Dodgers have the power to
do what they wish with left-hander Carlos Perez. If they try to
send him to the minors now, he'll have to agree to it.
</P>
<P>
   Perez's binding contract with the Dodgers extending his
agreement to waive his right to refuse an assignment quietly passed
Tuesday. Perez can refuse an assignment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have to be worrying about it,'' Perez said. ``I'm glad
I'm part of the team, and like I always say, I want to help this
team win. We won two of three in Houston, so that's good.''
</P>
<P>
   It puts everyone involved in a potentially troublesome situation
if Perez doesn't improve in his next few starts because the only
way the Dodgers can rid themselves of him, if he declines a
minor-league assignment, is to release him or trade him.
</P>
<P>
   And that will be something the Dodgers don't need. They've made
a pair of trades in the last 10 days that were aimed, at least in
part, at providing payroll flexibility. However, Perez signed a
three-year, $15.6-million contract before going 2-10 with a 7.43
ERA in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, manager Davey Johnson, general manager Kevin
Malone and managing general partner and CEO Bob Daly are willing to
keep trotting Perez out there for his starts. The Dodgers are 6-7
in games Perez starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made a commitment to keep him in the rotation,'' Dodgers
senior vice president Derrick Hall said. ``The team's been winning
with him when he starts. However, with that commitment, they're
certainly hoping Carlos will contribute effectively in that role
and help the team in what we expect to be a pennant race.
</P>
<P>
   Perez, who was 33-35 when he signed the deal, is being paid $5
million this season and he's guaranteed $7.5 million next season.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Perez (4-3) has more wins this season than many
expected. But he hasn't won since May 20, a span of five starts,
and his ERA is 5.73. And during that time, he is 0-1 with a 5.70
ERA.
</P>
<P>
   A player with five years of major-league service time can refuse
a minor-league assignment, but Perez waived that right when he
signed an agreement in late April. That expired May 31, which is
when Perez made a similar agreement but not for as much time. The
deal was thought to be extended to June 25, but it was learned the
date was June 20.
</P>
<P>
   __ White's rehab crawls on: Injured Dodgers center fielder Devon
White said he will try hitting off a tee when the club returns to
Los Angeles next week, but he remains noncommittal about being able
to return this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still weakness in there,'' said White, who added he
wasn't ready to face live pitching.
</P>
<P>
   __ Leyritz available: Recently acquired catcher/infielder Jim
Leyritz was available for the game. He met with manager Davey
Johnson beforehand to discuss his role with the Dodgers and was
told to take grounders at first and catch as many pitchers as he
can in the bullpen to familiarize himself with the staff. Johnson
added he could use Leyritz in the outfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't any consistency (with the Yankees),'' said
Leyritz, who was batting .218 with a homer and four RBI. ``I went
through one stretch where I didn't play for 21 days, played one
game and didn't play for eight days. It was real inconsistent.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Odds and ends: Right-hander Gregg Olson will throw a bullpen
session today and if all goes well, he'll begin a rehab assignment
when the club returns home Monday. . . . The Dodgers signed three
of their top five picks from this month's draft, but No. 1 pick Ben
Diggins remains unsigned. Agreeing to terms were right-handed
pitcher Joel Hanrahan (second round), catcher Koyie Hill (fourth)
and right-handed pitcher Heath Totten (fifth).

ACCORD REACHED IN ALBANY ON GUN CONTROLS AND SEX CRIMES
</HEADLINE>
  By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Gov. George Pataki and the Legislature Thursday
agreed to adopt the nation's most far-reaching package of gun
controls and a sweeping overhaul of sex crimes laws that imposes
tougher penalties and provides new services for victims.
</P>
<P>
   Racing to close this year's legislative session, the lawmakers
also agreed on a package of measures to improve school safety. One
would require that schools fingerprint job applicants, including
prospective teachers, and conduct criminal background checks on
them. Another would increase penalties for students who assault
teachers and teachers who assault students, and yet another would
make it easier for teachers to remove disruptive students from
their classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of a hate crimes law remained uncertain late into the
evening as the Democratic Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, and the
Republican Senate majority leader, Joseph Bruno, continued to
squabble over the packaging of a bill whose contents they have
agreed on.
</P>
<P>
   And it appeared very unlikely that the Assembly would pass a
bill backed by the Senate and the governor to reform the rules for
Republican presidential primaries, over fears about how the bill
would affect Democratic primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of deals were struck and hundreds of bills passed on what
had been billed as the last day the Legislature would be in session
this year, after frenzied, nearly round-the-clock negotiations in
the last week by the governor, the legislative leaders and members
of their staffs. Thursday's actions decided several important
issues, including these:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Assembly declined to pass either the Senate's or Pataki's
version of a bill that would have required legislative approval for
a proposed Indian casino in Monticello, in the Catskills. Silver
said the Assembly could decide to return in a special session in
December to vote on the Senate bill.
</P>
<P>
   _ The governor and both houses agreed to a bill that greatly
broadens state laws against money-laundering, including applying
those laws to wire transfers.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Assembly passed a Senate bill that would make it legal for
mothers of newborn infants to abandon their babies in safe places,
like hospital emergency rooms or police stations. Similar laws have
been enacted in Texas and in Germany, and advocates say they reduce
the number of newborns killed by their mothers. The Assembly vote
sends the bill to the governor, who has not said what he will do
with it.
</P>
<P>
   _ All three sides agreed on a measure to aid the New York Stock
Exchange's expansion plans, including authorizing a city agency to
sell $255 million in bonds and authorizing a state agency to
acquire property across the street from the current exchange.
</P>
<P>
   _ All three sides agreed to a bill allowing towns and villages
to regulate, or even ban, the use of personal watercraft, a
provision long sought by some communities and by environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Assembly refused to pass a bill permitting $125 million a
year in tax cuts by New York City because it included a decrease in
hotel taxes that the Democrats opposed.
</P>
<P>
   The gun control bill agreed to Thursday night closely mirrors
the one that Pataki, a Republican, proposed earlier this year,
stunning Republicans and Democrats alike, and prompting gun control
advocates to declare him a leader in their cause. Gun owners'
groups and the firearms industry have derided the measures as
either an intrusion on their rights or meaningless posturing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This important legislation will help make our streets safer by
reducing gun violence in communities across the state,'' Pataki
said Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The bill will make New York the first state in the country to
require ``ballistic fingerprinting'' of all new guns sold. Each gun
would be test-fired before sale so that the telltale markings it
leaves on bullets and shell casings could be recorded and entered
into a state computer database, for later comparison to slugs and
shells found at crime scenes.
</P>
<P>
   The bill requires background checks on all gun buyers at gun
shows, to weed out people with criminal records who are prohibited
from owning guns. Federal law requires licensed gun dealers to
conduct background checks on buyers, but most of the sales at gun
shows are by private citizens who are exempt from that rule.
Sixteen other states have requirements.
</P>
<P>
   New York will become the fifth state to ban assault weapons. A
1994 federal law banned them, but local prosecutors need a state
law to bring charges in state courts.
</P>
<P>
   The bill requires that every new handgun be sold with a trigger
lock, making New York one of six states to do so. It raises the
minimum age for obtaining a handgun permit and buying a handgun
from 18 to 21, the age required by 10 other states. And it requires
that owners report lost or stolen guns to the police within 24
hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``These tough anti-gun measures will help keep firearms out of
the hands of young people and protect schoolchildren and all New
Yorkers,'' Silver said.
</P>
<P>
   Republican lawmakers have long called for tougher criminal
penalties for sex crimes, and this year, Silver signaled led this
year that he agreed, but insisted that they be tied to broader
services for victims of those crimes. Talks on the issue
languished, until given new impetus by the June 11 assaults on
women in Central Park after the National Puerto Rican Day Parade.
</P>
<P>
   The bill agreed on and passed Thursday creates a crime of
``forcible touching,'' a felony, to apply to cases like the ones in
Central Park, which until now have often been treated as
misdemeanors.

RANGERS COME UP EMPTY IN CLUTCH SITUATIONS, LOSE TO TWINS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Sitting in last place and trying to keep from
being buried by the rampaging Oakland Athletics, the Rangers find
themselves with little margin for error.
</P>
<P>
   Key hits must be delivered. Good pitches must be made. Rundowns
must be executed properly. Otherwise, dire consequences can be
suffered as the Rangers found out last night in a 3-2 loss to the
Minnesota Twins at The Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers failed to execute a tricky rundown in the top of the
ninth inning that allowed the go-ahead run to score, then watched
in frustration as they failed to exploit a first-and-third, one-out
situation in the bottom of the inning with their two best hitters
at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Ivan Rodriguez popped out to shortstop off Twins
reliever Bob Wells, and Rafael Palmeiro flied out to right to end
the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a frustrating year,'' said Palmeiro, who had a
run-scoring single in the third but also popped out with runners at
first and second with two out in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's who you want to have up there in the ninth,'' Rangers
manager Johnny Oates said. ``I'll take my chances with those guys
in the same situation tomorrow night.''
</P>
<P>
   Starter Matt Perisho delivered seven strong innings but it
wasn't enough to allow the Rangers to complete a three-game sweep
of the Twins. Instead the Rangers dropped to 8 1/2 games behind the
Athletics in the American League West.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't feel bad,'' shortstop Royce Clayton said. ``We just
won two of three games. It's not easy to sweep a big-league team. I
don't care who they are.''
</P>
<P>
   With the score tied 2-2, Butch Huskey started the Twins' ninth
with a double to right field off Rangers reliever Tim Crabtree.
Corey Koskie then flied out to left and Denny Hocking walked on a
full-count pitch, barely checking his swing on a 97 mph fastball
from Crabtree.
</P>
<P>
   Chad Moeller followed with a high chopper to the right side.
Second baseman Frank Catalanotto charged it and fielded it in the
baseline just in front of Hocking, who immediately started
retreating to avoid being tagged. When he did, Catalanotto flipped
to first for the out.
</P>
<P>
   That left Hocking hung up between first and second and Huskey,
dangling off third, watching the rundown carefully. First baseman
Rafael Palmeiro threw to Clayton, who started running Hocking back
to first.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to get the out in front of you until he breaks for
home,'' Clayton said.
</P>
<P>
   As Clayton went after Hocking, Huskey inched farther off third.
When Clayton threw back to first, Huskey broke for home and slid in
just ahead of Palmeiro's throw
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really not a gamble,'' Huskey said. ``You work on that
play all the time in spring training. You just have to have the
instincts on when to go. I caught a break because it's a harder
throw for a left-handed first baseman.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Oates, ``I thought \Rthe Twins\S executed very well. Other
than totally disregard the runner between first and second, there's
not much else we can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Perisho, trying to clinch his spot in the Rangers' post-All-Star
break rotation, went seven innings in the longest outing of his 13
major-league starts. He allowed two runs on five hits and two walks
with four strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Coomer homered in the second inning for one run and, after
the Rangers forged a 2-1 lead, the Twins got another run off
Perisho in the sixth when Koskie beat out a two-out bunt down the
third-base line to score Matt Lawton from third base.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way they got their runs, they earned them,'' Perisho said.
``I never imagined he would bunt in that situation. I've faced him
a lot in Triple A and even a few times up here ... when he laid
down that bunt, it totally blew my mind.''

EDITORIAL: UPDATING DIPLOMACY'S LANGUAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, June 23:
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to ridicule the State Department for replacing the
evocative term ``rogue nations'' with the more diplomatic and
touchy-feely ``states of concern'' when referring to trouble spots
like North Korea, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Sudan and Cuba. But beyond the
blurring of semantic clarity lies a welcome recognition that the
world has changed in ways that make the ``rogue'' category a poor
guide to intelligent foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright unveiled the new
terminology in a radio interview Monday. Like rogue nations, states
of concern have unpredictable, authoritarian leaders, histories of
sponsoring terrorism and, Cuba excepted, programs for building
biological, chemical or nuclear weapons. But as the department's
new language recognizes, the strategy of lumping all these
countries together as international rogues, unreachable through
normal tools of diplomacy and fit only for isolation and military
containment, has grown out of date.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea is an obvious case in point. Its once-reclusive
leader just held a successful meeting with his South Korean
counterpart, and both sides now talk of national reconciliation and
economic interchange. Pyongyang has honored its agreements with
Washington to suspend nuclear weapons development and
flight-testing of long-range missiles. In response, Washington has
eased economic sanctions and made North Korea Asia's largest
recipient of American assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Other nations formerly known as rogues have not come that far.
But for years Washington has been engaged in a delicate courtship
with reform-minded elected officials in Iran. Indirect diplomacy
with Libya, through the United Nations, helped bring the Lockerbie
bombing suspects to trial. Many members of Congress have begun to
recognize that a less restrictive policy toward Cuba could increase
America's ability to influence political change there as the Castro
era draws to a close.
</P>
<P>
   Some states of concern still require ostracism, containment and
military threats. One clear example is Saddam Hussein's Iraq, which
defies United Nations Security Council resolutions, reneges on its
diplomatic promises and would quickly divert any export revenues it
could get its hands on into weapons programs. Every serious foreign
problem facing America requires its own specific policy
prescription. No longer talking about rogue states will make that
easier to explain.  &QL;

WHERE TO FASTEN THE BLAME FOR SURGING GASOLINE PRICES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although Big Oil and OPEC get all the blame for soaring gasoline
prices, history will reveal government as the true culprit.
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect a public revelation any time soon, though. Everyone
in Washington is working overtime to persuade voters that pump pain
is caused by those who produce and sell petroleum, not those who
tax and regulate it.
</P>
<P>
   This is the way it always happens during shortages and price
spikes. Big Oil is flayed for gouging, but the question always
remains: If gouging is so easily done, why doesn't it happen all
the time?
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, nobody connects obviously misguided federal policies
with marketplace disruptions. 'Twas ever thus, since the first oil
crisis in '73. Few Americans, however, ever perceive the line
between meddlesome government and roiled energy markets.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with the reformulated gasoline anti-pollution
mandate that recently went into effect in some areas. It's costing
more to implement than regulators forecast, but nobody knows how
much more it will ultimately cost. Why? Nobody knows how much
already scarce refining capacity must be diverted to meet mandated
demands.
</P>
<P>
   So are the feds considering a suspension of the mandate, at
least during peak driving season? Silly question.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the federal gasoline tax, much of which is
collected but goes to general budget outlays instead of road
construction. Thus the highway trust fund has about $25 billion
worth of IOUs from the Treasury. Question: If the feds aren't going
to use all the pump taxes to fix roads, why not partially repeal
the levy and give motorists a break?
</P>
<P>
   Nobody talks about government's oil reserve, either. Surging oil
prices normally would encourage U.S. producers to bring more oil to
market. But what happens if American producers invest a lot of
money developing new supply sources and government decides to dump
its oil cache onto the market? Prices probably tank, and the
industry's investment comes a cropper.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, nobody is pushing to develop northern Alaska's fields
as a way to counter foreign oil clout. Washington, in fact, seems
more interested in keeping potential domestic supply sources out of
production rather than using them to increase supply and decrease
reliance on predatory foreign producers.
</P>
<P>
   Americans don't hear much about how government policies and
actions exacerbate an already difficult situation. Instead, they
get a lot of congressional grandstanding about how obscene profits
should justify legislation to counter soaring gasoline prices.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody, however, has profited more obscenely from oil than the
federal government. The federal government collects
petroleum-related taxes, politicians profit substantially from
industry campaign contributions, and regulators enjoy their profit
in the form of increased power, which is coin of the realm in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   One thing to remember is that no politician or bureaucrat ever
wrested a single barrel of oil, and their actions are more likely
to make gasoline prices go up than down. Whatever the price of
gasoline is at any given time, you can bet it would probably be
lower were it not for political lust for money and power.

INADEQUATE JAILS A PROBLEM THROUGHOUT RURAL MISSOURI, KANSAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIT WAGAR  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The slaying of two Randolph County Jail
guards Thursday stunned sheriffs in Missouri and Kansas, who said
that without new security it also could happen to them.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff Robert Dawson of Macon County, which borders Randolph
County on the north, said he requested more security as soon as he
heard about the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to the County Commission this morning about adding
bullet-proof glass, new steel doors where there are wooden ones now
in the processing area and lobby, and maybe additional cameras,''
he said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The jail, which is about 90 years old, has few features designed
to keep intruders out.
</P>
<P>
   ``With old jails, security is a common problem in out-state
Missouri,'' Dawson said. ``And the problem is money.''
</P>
<P>
   The lack of security became apparent early Thursday when guards
at the Randolph County Jail let a man and a woman into the
facility. One of them pulled a gun and opened fire, killing the two
guards.
</P>
<P>
   State and local officials blamed the aging and sometimes
dangerous condition of many jails in rural Missouri on a lack of
money and political will.
</P>
<P>
   When county commissioners have a choice of financing jail
improvements or paving roads, the latter almost always wins, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   So new jails are often financed with bonds or a local tax
increase that must be approved by voters. Jail supporters have had
mixed success in referendums.
</P>
<P>
   In Lafayette County, Mo., which has a 61-year-old jail, Lt.
Darren Hewitt said two efforts to raise taxes to pay for a new jail
failed. The most recent attempt was November, when it failed by a
4-1 ratio.
</P>
<P>
   O.J. Stone, president of the Missouri Deputy Sheriffs
Association, said taxpayers often begrudged tax increases for
jails. The attitude is that criminals don't need luxurious
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bond issues are a tough sell,'' Stone said. ``The public has a
lot of projects to fund, and when you say you need a bigger, better
jail, people don't want to hear it.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, jails are becoming fuller as the state prison
system houses more inmates in them to relieve crowding, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The extent of the problem varies widely from county to county
because the state plays almost no role in local decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Corrections Department spokesman Tim Kniest said state officials
had no authority or responsibility to see that conditions at county
jails met minimum standards.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Vermeersch, executive director of the Missouri Sheriffs
Association, said the only jail standards in Missouri were those
that sprang from constitutional prohibitions against cruel and
unusual punishment. So no group keeps track of how many substandard
jails Missouri has, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stone said many Missouri jails dated from the 1930s and lacked
serviceable utilities and air conditioning. Many have antiquated
cells that are too small for inmates.
</P>
<P>
   Vermeersch said his group has talked about asking for state help
to upgrade jails and hire more jailers. Sheriffs have received
several new duties in recent years without new revenue to hire more
deputies.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriffs must register sex offenders, fight domestic violence
and track the race of drivers stopped for traffic offenses. County
commissioners are sympathetic, but they are politicians who prefer
financing high-visibility projects, Vermeersch said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something has to give, and often that means no more
deputies,'' he said. ``Commissioners feel they have to support a
new bridge or road over law enforcement.''
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Steve Gaw, a Moberly Democrat who represents
Randolph County, said state officials recognized the problem. Gaw
said he and House Majority Leader Wayne Crump, a Potosi Democrat,
discussed the possibility of a revolving fund for jail construction
within the state's capital improvement budget.
</P>
<P>
   But the idea was floated late in this year's legislative
session, and they decided that it could not be done without setting
up a formal program. So the idea was scrapped for this year.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's shootings will force state officials to take a new
look at the state's role in financing county jails, Gaw said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this will prompt a growing examination of how to deal
with older facilities that do not meet modern standards,'' Gaw
said. ``I think it's something that county government and the state
have to look at together and possibly look to federal funding as
well.''
</P>
<P>
   The growth in law enforcement costs, especially those related to
juvenile crime, make such a review long overdue, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jailers in Clay, Ray, Carroll and Platte counties said they
doubted the Randolph County shootings could be repeated in their
jails.
</P>
<P>
   But in Caldwell County, Sheriff Wayne Adkinson said the
130-year-old jail offered little security.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to get the County Commission to build us a better
jail, but until then there's nothing we can do,'' he said. ``We
could definitely have a problem here.''
</P>
<P>
   In Lafayette County, Hewitt said doors were opened for visitors
a hundred times a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing to do but buzz them in and see what they
want,'' Hewitt said. ``We never know what they'll want. That's just
the chance we have to take.''
</P>
<P>
   Kansas has almost no standards for jails. The ones that exist
were enacted in 1868, seven years after statehood.
</P>
<P>
   Until 1996, the state Department of Corrections made annual
county jail inspections using a set of advisory standards.
Violations could prompt nothing more than recommendations for
change, said Bill Miskell, a Corrections Department spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   It was up to county officials to decide whether to comply. That
program had been in existence 10 or 15 years before it was
scrapped, Miskell said.

PIECING IT TOGETHER

<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ During the last week of spring training, the Los
Angeles Dodgers targeted late June as the time teams would know
where they stood and what they would need for a second-half run at
the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Through the evaluation, the Dodgers figured reliever Alan Mills
or utility infielder Jose Vizcaino were expendable and decided that
with Geronimo Berroa's injury, Jim Leyritz's right-handed power bat
was a must.
</P>
<P>
   Questions remain about the leadoff and center-field spots, the
closer's role and whether the Dodgers will get production out of
the fourth and fifth starters in the rotation. But those are
questions that must be answered and they'll likely be answered
internally. And that's when the Dodgers will know whether they have
all the parts to make a run at the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think all the pieces to the puzzle are here, but you never
know what (management) is going to do by the July 31 (trade)
deadline,'' Dodgers reliever Jeff Shaw said. ``They may go out and
pick somebody else up, another pitcher. There's only a couple of
question marks. Arizona has played well at home (25-10) and they
have not run away from us. It's going to be a jockeying thing
here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers withstood injuries to right-hander Kevin Brown,
third baseman Adrian Beltre and Kevin Elster, who has since lost
his starting shortstop job and is in a platoon with Alex Cora.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers will get healthier Monday when catcher Todd Hundley
should return. But no one knows whether center fielder Devon White
will return from a partially torn left rotator cuff or whether
he'll need season-ending surgery.
</P>
<P>
   There was also the distraction of the impending suspensions, but
even so, the Dodgers are 2 games behind Arizona in the National
League West.
</P>
<P>
   But it's hardly time to make the big push. That happens in a
month when teams go through another evaluation period in
preparation for the July 31 trading deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you have to wait and see for the next month or so and
see how teams load up and that will help determine what we need to
do,'' Dodgers right fielder Shawn Green said. ``You have to see
who's available. Starting now, it becomes a lot more clear as each
week goes by. There's no telling what's going to happen in our
division the next month.''
</P>
<P>
   But that could prove to be a problem for the Dodgers. While
Arizona and Colorado have the organizational depth to make a
blockbuster deal at the trading deadline, the Dodgers fall short.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I know, (general manager) Kevin (Malone) is always
working the phones, but the (minor-league) system is still not
where it needs to be, so there's not a lot of depth to where you
can talk about moving some of them,'' said Green. ``It's a couple
years behind to where you have the insurance policies at Triple-A
to have all the parts.''
</P>
<P>
   Leyritz, or Berroa, provide the right-handed bat off the bench
that makes opposing managers choose between facing Dave Hansen or,
at this time, Leyritz. But Shaw has blown six of 18 save chances
and is no longer the end-all, be-all closer. Instead, he'll get
help from Mike Fetters, Terry Adams and Matt Herges.
</P>
<P>
   White's uncertain status has turned center field into a platoon
among Todd Hollandsworth and F.P. Santangelo and left the Dodgers
without their choice for leadoff hitter.
</P>
<P>
   And the fourth and fifth spots in the rotation, occupied by
Carlos Perez and Orel Hershiser, remain suspect. Perez is 4-3, but
he's won once since May 3. Hershiser's lone win came during the
nostalgic home opener, and he's made only four starts and has a
10.80 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always believe in having two aces on a team, and the way
Chan Ho (Park) is pitching, he's proven he can be an ace,'' said
Dodgers left fielder Gary Sheffield, knowing Kevin Brown's status
as an ace is a given. ``But you have to go out and prove you can do
it. You can have the stuff all day long, but you have to be able to
do it and execute.''

   WESTWOOD, Kan. _ Atlanta-based BellSouth.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth went head-to-head against WorldCom in bidding for
Sprint in October, but lost out to WorldCom.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth has acquired little in the United States while its
regional Bell brethren Bell Atlantic and SBC Communications have
gone on an acquisition spree, buying up territory and customers.
</P>
<P>
   Since Sprint accepted WorldCom's offer, however, BellSouth has
expanded its operation in Latin America and entered into an
agreement with SBC Communications to join their wireless operation
and form a nationwide carrier. That would complicate any new offer
for Sprint, on top of regulatory concerns.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth is still not allowed to offer long distance to its
customers until it proves its local markets are open to
competition. That doesn't preclude a deal for all or parts of
Sprint, however. And with Bell Atlantic's recent acquisition of GTE
Corp., there is a precedent for how regulators would treat such a
deal.
</P>
<P>
   There's also the question of money. BellSouth has already
indicated that there's a limit to what it's willing to pay for
Sprint.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts still hold out the possibility that Sprint will
reverse course, pull out of its merger with WorldCom and go looking
for its own deals. That would certainly please employees, if not
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   If the WorldCom deal collapses, Sprint's stock would probably
fall, but it wouldn't be impossible for the company to fund an
acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   ``These deals can come together in a lot of ways,'' said Jeanne
Schaaf at Forrester Research, a market research firm. ``The best
bet for Sprint is to go with a brand new player who can continue to
breathe some life into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Candidates? Global Crossing or Equant. Bermuda-based Global
Crossing is building a worldwide undersea cable and data network,
and could provide Sprint with international reach, Web hosting and
media expertise.
</P>
<P>
   Amsterdam-based Equant owns the world's largest data network,
reaching businesses in more than 220 territories and countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sprint is a pretty strong player when it comes to
innovation,'' Schaaf said of telecommunications companies. ``What
they need is a partner with speed, aggressiveness, not one of these
old-style telcos.''

SPRINT LIKELY TO ENTERTAIN SUITORS IF WORLDCOM DEAL FALTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TED SICKINGER  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WESTWOOD, Kan. _ Whether Sprint Corp. submits to antitrust
regulators, agreeing to sell its entire long-distance division, or
the company decides to scrap its proposed merger with WorldCom
Inc., the for sale sign is probably going out again in Westwood.
</P>
<P>
   Despite employees' hopes and executives' statements, few
analysts think Sprint is prepared to go it alone in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very rare that a company would agree to be bought then
not be open to other offers that would come along,'' said Mel
Marten, an analyst with Edward Jones brokerage company in St.
Louis. ``It might not happen the next day, but an offer will
definitely come at some point.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason is simple. All phone companies are trying to put
together a full package of services, including local, long
distance, Internet, wireless and international.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint, which employs nearly 20,000 people in the metro area,
doesn't have much in the way of local or international services,
and it needs a partner to get them. Sprint could be a buyer, but
most analysts think that's unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   A decision from Sprint's board on how to proceed with regulators
could come in the next few days. No matter what the outcome, the
same short list of potential acquirers are considered potential
bidders for part or all of the company.
</P>
<P>
   When handicapping the field, most observers tend to look
overseas first.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, the value of shares in European
telecommunications firms has almost doubled, while those of their
U.S. counterparts stagnated. With their shares trading at much
higher multiples of earnings than U.S. companies, European
companies can use their more valuable stock as currency to buy
companies relatively cheaply in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Few companies are more flush with cash than Deutsche Telekom.
And having failed in recent merger attempts with Telecom Italia and
Qwest Communications, the German giant is eager to do a deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``DT has been champing at the bit to do something big,'' said
Brian Adamik, an analyst with the Yankee Group, a market research
firm. ``The time has never been better for an international company
to come over and buy someone.''
</P>
<P>
   European analysts who follow the company think it could raise
$50 billion in cash to make an acquisition, which would allow it to
buy Sprint's long-distance business from WorldCom without the
complications that a stock transaction would bring in a three-way
deal.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts also think the company could probably afford to make an
acquisition with stock as large as $200 billion, large enough to
swallow either WorldCom or Sprint should their deal collapse
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   The German company makes no bones of its desire to enter the
U.S. market. And if past statements are any indication, it will be
looking for three things: Internet, wireless and a systems
integration business.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint fills two of the three needs, offering the fastest
growing wireless business in the country, Sprint PCS, and one of
the top four Internet backbones in the world. It also has a systems
integration business, Sprint Paranet, though it's a small player
that has struggled of late.
</P>
<P>
   If Deutsche Telekom decided to buy WorldCom, as some analysts
have suggested could happen, it would get the biggest Internet
backbone in the world, but no wireless assets. WorldCom also sold
its systems integration business last year.
</P>
<P>
   Another complicating factor in a Deutsche Telekom//WorldCom
tie-up would be WorldCom's extensive European networks, an overlap
that regulators would probably want to eliminate.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Deutsche Telekom already owns a 10 percent stake in
Sprint dating from their ill-fated international venture with
France Telecom, Global One, which was dissolved earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Both the French and Germans have agreed to sell their 10 percent
stakes in Sprint upon the successful completion of the WorldCom
deal, but if that deal falls through, the Deutsche Telekom may be
looking to buy.
</P>
<P>
   For that matter, so could France Telecom. France Telecom Chief
Executive Michel Bon, however, has not been nearly as aggressive as
his German counterpart Ron Sommer in statements about expansion to
the United States. France Telecom may also lack the financial and
management flexibility that Deutsche Telekom has to make a large
acquisition right now.
</P>
<P>
   France Telecom is still in the midst of acquiring the United
Kingdom provider, Orange PLC, and getting the house in order at
Global One, which it inherited after Sprint and Deutsche Telekom
left the partnership.
</P>
<P>
   France Telecom is also rumored to be interested in taking over
the Dutch communications provider Equant.
</P>
<P>
   ``France Telecom could take a hard look at Sprint,'' said David
Neil, an analyst with the Gartner Group in Toronto. ``You don't get
too many opportunities to go out and buy a company like it. But
they might have enough on their plate already.''
</P>
<P>
   The international long shot is Nippon Telegraph and Telephone
Corp., the largest phone company in the world by sales, but one
that has remained on the sidelines as other carriers have expanded
internationally.
</P>
<P>
   After years of dominating the insular Japanese market, however,
Nippon is showing signs of going global, with recent purchases a
U.S. manager of corporate Web sites, and 15 percent of a mobile
phone company in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Under Japanese law, however, Nippon must apply to issue more
shares for acquisitions, and can't swap shares if it brings foreign
ownership above 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their political process is working against the company, but if
they can get beyond that I'd put them at the top of the list,''
said Richard Nespola, chief executive of the Management Network
Group Inc., a telecommunications consulting firm based in Overland
Park, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   A quiet player on the domestic front so far, but a perennial
favorite when analysts talk about anyone acquiring Sprint, is
Atlanta-based BellSouth. MORE

POLICE BOARD TELLS DEPARTMENT TO FOLLOW STATE FORFEITURE LAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KAREN DILLON  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Under mounting pressure, the Kansas City
police board ordered the department Thursday to follow state law
when seizing drug money and property.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City is thought to be the first major law enforcement
agency to adopt a policy of following Missouri forfeiture law,
which usually sends such money to education, instead of working
often with federal agencies to keep seized money.
</P>
<P>
   The board also agreed Thursday not to fight a lawsuit filed by
the Missouri attorney general seeking $3.5 million in cash as well
as other property that Kansas City police have been holding onto
for several years.
</P>
<P>
   The money and property come from seizures, unclaimed money and
other types of cash that under state law should have gone to
schools in four counties as well as county and state treasuries.
The money already had been set aside by police pending a decision
on where it should go.
</P>
<P>
   The board said it would turn the cash over to the Jackson County
judge handling the lawsuit and ask for an order to allow the
department to auction the property, with proceeds to be held by the
court.
</P>
<P>
   Both of the board's actions came after weeks of adverse
publicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's to the point that my own stepdaughter thinks we are
wrong,'' said police board member Joe Mulvihill.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Jay Nixon's lawsuit was filed a week ago. Last
month, The Kansas City Star published a series of stories showing
that police across the country evade state laws with the help of
federal agencies to keep millions of dollars in drug money.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent a conflict of interest, many states have laws that
prohibit police from directly profiting from crime-fighting. In
Missouri, the constitution generally requires the money to go to
education.
</P>
<P>
   But The Star found that, instead of following state laws, police
often hand off drug money they seize to a federal law enforcement
agency that then returns a portion, usually 80 percent, to police.
</P>
<P>
   This week state Sen. Harry Wiggins, a Kansas City Democrat, sent
a letter to the police board asking that it fully support a bill he
is sponsoring. The bill would force Missouri police to follow state
forfeiture laws.
</P>
<P>
   During Thursday's special meeting of the Board of Police
Commissioners, the three members who attended _ Mulvihill, Stacey
Daniels and Dennis Eckold _ voted unanimously to adopt a policy
based on Wiggins' bill. A written policy will be presented to the
board Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Wiggins was delighted when contacted later.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police commissioners have shown the state how to represent
law enforcement and how to represent the public,'' Wiggins said.
``This is magnificent.''
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Ronnie DePasco, a Kansas City Democrat who attended
the meeting, said the support of Kansas City police would help the
bill in the next legislative session.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the right thing to do instead of waiting for it to pass
until February next year,'' said DePasco, majority floor leader.
</P>
<P>
   DePasco said he hoped other agencies around the state would
follow. But he said rural law enforcement has been stubborn about
the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``(They) are opposed to giving the money to the school
districts,'' DePasco said.
</P>
<P>
   Mulvihill, who proposed the policy, estimated that Kansas City
police have been receiving $1 million a year in forfeiture money.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a $120 million budget, it doesn't seem like this million
dollars is worth all this adverse publicity,'' Mulvihill said. ``I
think we should quit this questionable policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week the board also came under fire when the attorney
general filed his lawsuit involving the $3.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit stems from a story The Star published in 1996 about
the money. In 1997, the department filed a friendly lawsuit asking
a judge to decide where the money was to go. But in March of this
year, Dale Close, the department's attorney, asked that the lawsuit
be dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   When Nixon filed a new lawsuit based on the money, it caught
police board commissioners by surprise even though Nixon had sent a
letter to Eckold, the board president, and faxed a letter to Close
almost two weeks before the lawsuit was filed. Eckold said he never
received his letter.
</P>
<P>
   In the two letters, Nixon outlined the travails his attorneys
went through trying to negotiate with Close before filing the
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Board members Thursday raised concerns about why Close never
told them he was negotiating with Nixon's attorneys for two months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why didn't we just follow through with the lawsuit we had
filed?'' Mulvihill asked. ``Or why didn't we cooperate with the
attorney general's office after the case was dismissed?
</P>
<P>
   ``But the more important issue is apparently we have alienated
the attorney general.''
</P>
<P>
   Mulvihill read aloud the portion of the letter that discussed
how a conference call had been scheduled between Close, department
personnel and Nixon's attorneys. When the attorneys called, they
received Close's answering machine. They left a message but he
never returned the call, the letter said.
</P>
<P>
   Close said he thought Nixon's attorneys just wanted to schedule
a meeting to come to Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   When asked why he did not tell the board that Nixon was planning
to file the lawsuit, Close said he thought he had gotten the matter
resolved after receiving the letter. He immediately telephoned
Nixon and they agreed to continue the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   But Nixon said the information his office then received from the
department was inconsistent, and he finally filed the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be encouraged by any steps in the right direction,''
Scott Holste, an attorney general's spokesman, said Thursday of the
board's decision not to fight the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Allan Hallquist, an attorney for the Kansas City School
District, said he was pleased but cautious. He said he did not
think that the department had procedures in place to prevent it
from keeping property and money in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am pleased the matter is resolved for the time being,''
Hallquist said. ``I'm not convinced we won't be back in five years.
I hope the board examines the procedures that need to be in place
so that the problem isn't repeated in the future.''

   HUNTSVILLE, Mo. _ information on Bulington.
The jail
</P>
<P>
   The shootings shocked the close-knit town of Huntsville.
</P>
<P>
   But local authorities have long complained about the jail, which
is housed in a two-story red brick building near two churches and
some houses.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a secure prison,'' Gordy said.
</P>
<P>
   Ancell went further.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think `security' is the wrong word,'' Ancell said. ``It's
just inadequate. That...old jail was built in 1909.''
</P>
<P>
   Several referendums on more money for law enforcement have been
rejected in recent years, including one last year that would have
financed a new jail, Gordy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want law enforcement, but they don't want to pay for
it,'' said a frustrated and distraught Ancell.
</P>
<P>
   Egley himself, in his role as city councilman, had lobbied for a
new jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``There always seems to be something wrong, and there's just too
many opportunities for something negative to happen,'' Egley told
the Moberly Monitor-Index last October.
</P>
<P>
   The 36 inmates in the jail Thursday morning have been moved to
other facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to try to make (county officials) believe we have to
do some work on it'' before reopening the jail, Ancell said.
</P>
<P>
   A bulletproof glass barrier between the dispatch area and the
lobby would be the first order of business, he said. He also said
he'd like video cameras instead of just television monitors as
enhanced security.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's not cheap,'' Ancell said. ``And the county's broke.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, yellow crime tape encircles the jail. Its
front-yard flag flies at half-mast. And a rural county tries to
make sense of why two of its own were so violently lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just hard to believe,'' Gordy said. ``We're all in a
state of shock.''

TWO GUARDS KILLED IN ATTEMPTED JAILBREAK IN CENTRAL MISSOURI 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATT STEARNS  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTSVILLE, Mo. _ The last thing the two unarmed Randolph County
Jail guards ever did was buzz open the jail's front door about
12:40 a.m. Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes and several shots later, one was dead and the
other dying, and the man and woman who had come through the jail's
door were frantically searching for the key to a cell holding a
friend. They left the central Missouri jail without finding it,
sparking a massive manhunt that ended when two persons were
arrested about eight hours later in Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   Killed were Leon Egley, 33, the jail supervisor, and Jason
Acton, 36, a sheriff's deputy. They were the only two on duty at
the time in the jail.
</P>
<P>
   Charged with two counts of first-degree murder in their deaths
was Michael Andrew Tisius, 19, of Moberly, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   Also charged was Tracie Ann Bulington, 27, of La Plata, Mo.
Bulington was charged with two counts of second-degree murder,
armed criminal action, burglary and aiding the escape of a
prisoner.
</P>
<P>
   The two were arrested about 9:35 a.m. Thursday in a restaurant
parking lot along U.S. 36 on the eastern edge of Wathena, in the
northeast corner of Kansas. They offered no resistance, Doniphan
County Sheriff Mike Batchelder said.
</P>
<P>
   Batchelder said the two were unarmed. The Missouri Highway
Patrol found what is thought to be the murder weapon, a revolver,
along U.S. 36 west of Macon, Mo., which is north of Huntsville. A
car that authorities think Tisius and Bulington were driving was
found in Elwood, Kan., east of Wathena.
</P>
<P>
   Tisius and Bulington waived extradition and were expected in
Moberly by Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities say the two had been planning for weeks to free Roy
Vance, an inmate from Macon County being held on a drug charge.
Macon County Sheriff Robert Dawson said Vance was transferred after
he tried to escape the Macon County Jail.
</P>
<P>
   Randolph County Sheriff Don Ancell said a man and woman were
buzzed in the front door of the 91-year-old jail, which sits on
Main Street in downtown Huntsville, a town of about 1,600 people.
The two then opened fire on Acton and Egley.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is, there's no barrier between the lobby and the
dispatch area,'' said Ancell, who complained bitterly about the
state of the old jail.
</P>
<P>
   Acton died at the scene; Egley at a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Ancell said the two guards had no reason to be suspicious when
the buzzer rang at such a late hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not unusual at all,'' he said. ``This is the information
center for the Randolph County sheriff's office. People stop in all
the time at all times to report incidents, ask for directions _
maybe they're stuck on the highway.''
</P>
<P>
   Ancell said jail guards were unarmed for a simple reason: ``Jail
and guns don't mix.'' The victims
</P>
<P>
   Leon Egley ``had a heart as big as Texas,'' said his friend John
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Egley had worked as jail supervisor since 1997. Single, with no
children, he lived in a second-floor apartment on Main Street just
a few blocks from the jail.
</P>
<P>
   A quiet man, Egley appeared to have two passions in life:
Huntsville and helping people. His sister-in-law, Diana Egley, said
his job at the jail let him combine both.
</P>
<P>
   Egley also was an enthusiastic member of the Huntsville City
Council. He was appointed by Mayor Carl Gordy in 1998 and elected
on his own just a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would take the ordinance books home at night to read,''
Gordy said.
</P>
<P>
   He brought the same passion to his job at the jail, said his
mother, Doreen Little, as she sat in a chair in front of her son's
old apartment building, fighting off the heat and the grief.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every job has its ups and downs,'' Little said. ``But he liked
it. He felt like he was helping people.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he liked helping people so much that he often worked
odd shifts at the jail _ something out of the ordinary for a
supervisor whose normal hours were 8 to 5.
</P>
<P>
   That was the case the night he died.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had no business being on third shift,'' said County Clerk
Jim Sears. ``He would every so often work third shifts when there
were new people to help break them in and to relate to the issues
they had.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason Acton was one such new person. He had just started work in
May. He lived near Rocheport, Mo., but had planned on moving closer
to Huntsville in a few months after he got married.
</P>
<P>
   He preferred the peace and quiet of Randolph County, he told
Carol Summers, the deputy county clerk.
</P>
<P>
   And Ancell said Acton quickly impressed his superiors on the
job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I start most everyone in the jail,'' Ancell said. ``I was
going to put him on the road (as a sheriff's deputy) before long.
He would have made a...good officer. He had his head on straight.''
The accused
</P>
<P>
   It's not clear how well Tisius and Bulington knew Roy Vance.
Ancell said he thought Bulington was romantically linked to one of
the men, but he didn't know which one.
</P>
<P>
   Tisius drifted from job to job and occasionally wound up in jail
himself, said Ancell and Tisius' former neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't have to case the place,'' Ancell said. ``He's been
in here three or four times'' for minor offenses.
</P>
<P>
   His last local address was in Moberly, about five miles from
Huntsville. For more than a year, Tisius shared an apartment in a
house near downtown Moberly with a girlfriend _ not Bulington _ and
their toddler girl, said Christina Rozkiewicz, who lives in the
house's other apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Tisius and his girlfriend split up in May, Rozkiewicz said.
Tisius told Rozkiewicz he was moving to Iowa with his stepfather.
</P>
<P>
   Life in Randolph County seemed to have dried up for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was working everywhere,'' said Tony Davis, Rozkiewicz's
roommate. ``McDonald's, a factory, a nursing home. He kept losing
his jobs because he kept getting arrested.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Davis said, ``he seemed real nice and polite.
Anytime we asked him to turn down the radio, he wouldn't mouth off
or anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Police had no more information on Bulington. MORE

COMMENTARY: THE `MISSISSIPPIFICATION' OF CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS 
</HEADLINE>
   By BRENT STAPLES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   California's public schools were among the most admired in the
country until 20 years of disinvestment and teaching fads drove
them into the ground. The decline announced itself dramatically in
the mid-90s, when a succession of disastrous performances on
national tests placed California's children at or near the bottom
of the country in reading, math and science. The slippage has
national implications, given that one in every nine public-school
children in the United States is enrolled in California. The shock
of dismal test scores has propelled the governor and the
legislature into a frenzy of reform that has committed more than $7
billion and touched on every aspect of public education.
</P>
<P>
   But the lack of a blueprint for this deluge of new mandates has
left many districts paralyzed and uncertain how to proceed. Worse
yet, a civil rights lawsuit filed last month makes the case that
this chaotic reform effort could deepen educational inequality by
raising standards without providing the necessary resources to meet
them, leaving poor districts even further behind the rich ones than
they are today.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble dates back to Proposition 13 and the tax revolt of
the 1970s, which savaged support for the public universities,
children's programs and, most tragically, the public schools. Peter
Schrag, a columnist for The Sacramento Bee, angered some
Californians last month when he described the decline as
``Mississippification,'' arguing that rich, historically literate
California had fallen to the level of a poor Southern state that
has long been identified with poor schools and high rates of
illiteracy.
</P>
<P>
   Californians balked at the comparison, but the state's schools
do in fact lag behind Mississippi's in a few categories while
besting them narrowly in a few others. Low-income children in
Mississippi are more likely to have a fully certified teacher than
are low-income children in California. In addition, California's
fourth graders lag behind Mississippi on the federally sponsored
reading test known as the National Assessment of Educational
Progress.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid 90s, Gov. Pete Wilson reacted to voter outrage by
forcing through legislation that mandated smaller class sizes
without building more schools or increasing the teacher supply. The
resulting teacher shortage forced the schools to hire largely
unqualified instructors.
</P>
<P>
   Citing unfortunate outcomes like this one, Policy Analysis for
California Education, an influential research institute run jointly
by Stanford University and the University of California at
Berkeley, has called for a moratorium on school legislation until
the state issues a plan for coordinating the ``onslaught of new
mandates.''
</P>
<P>
   The current governor, Gray Davis, inherited the school system's
problems in 1999 and is placing great emphasis on cash rewards for
schools whose students read the most pages. In a recent interview,
Davis spoke excitedly of teachers who got their students to read
more by promising to dye their hair green, lie down with snakes or
bathe in pools of Jell-O. But given the civil rights suit, filed
last month by the Southern California branch of the American Civil
Liberties Union, the governor and the legislature need to
concentrate on the basic necessities of schooling _ books,
classrooms and teachers _ before they talk up gimmicks.
</P>
<P>
   The legislature has ordered a new curriculum and new high school
exit exams, but according to the ACLU lawsuit has failed to deal
with the fact that many schools in the state lack books. The suit
charges the state with denying tens of thousands of children the
basic public education to which the State Constitution entitles
them.
</P>
<P>
   The depositions taken for this suit from teachers and students
should be required reading for every Californian. For lack of
teachers and classrooms, thousands of California's children are
consigned to ``classes'' in which they get school credit for
running errands for the teachers and staff.
</P>
<P>
   In school after school, there are so few textbooks that students
are forbidden to take books home. A science teacher at a middle
school assigns his children to count stars for homework instead of
working from textbooks that are collected at the end of every
class.
</P>
<P>
   The most heartbreaking affidavit comes from 12-year-old Silas
Moutrie, a seventh grader at the Luther Burbank Middle School in
San Francisco, who writes: ``You can't take books home because we
don't have enough. . . . Instead we have to come to class to do the
same thing we could have done at home. We're probably behind other
schools because they get homework and they get to take their books
home.''
</P>
<P>
   Governor Davis said that the ACLU lawsuits were ``helpful
because they galvanize public attention.'' But as California's
chief advocate of education, Davis has the power to put these
inequalities on the public agenda. He made a courageous decision by
pledging not to run for re-election unless reading scores go up. He
also fought to win performance bonuses for accomplished teachers _
making it clear that the state values them. But he should also
commit himself to ensuring that every schoolchild in the state has
textbooks, a teacher and a place to sit. To build a reform, he
needs to start with a foundation and move up.  &QL;

I-45 rivalry won't be instantly bitter
<TEXT>
<P>
   By MICKEY HERSKOWITZ
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ To a team famished for good news, or even mediocre
news, the disclosure that the Astros likely will launch an annual
rivalry with the Texas Rangers next year is a trifle hard to
catalog. Travel-weary players gladly will accept a series against a
club only an hour away by air, but getting into this ``natural
rivalry'' thing, working up a real passion, might not happen
overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, next year is beginning to look uncomfortably close at
hand for the Astros, who have tumbled into Dante's Inferno, 19
games below .500 less than three months into this hellish season.
</P>
<P>
   Houston fans can start practicing, but how easy will it be to
refer to ``the hated Texas Rangers'' or exercise their lungs with
such sentiments as, ``Curse you, Pudge Rodriguez,'' or, ``Johnny
Oates can't lead a frog across the street?''
</P>
<P>
   Die-hard Astros fans view the American League as being as remote
as a Third World nation and did not see this bitter feud coming.
Therefore, we might explain that Rodriguez is the best catcher in
baseball, and Oates is a cheerful, pleasant cuss who has led the
Rangers to division titles in three of the past four years.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, the Astros have found any kind of rivalry elusive,
including the unnatural ones. They had a nice vendetta going with
the Dodgers when both teams were in the National League West and
Tommy Lasorda was guilty of assorted war crimes, such as snubbing
Joe Niekro in the All-Star Game. Today the Astros' enemies are
everywhere, but the team that tops their hit list is St. Louis,
based largely on the fact Houston was once a farm club of the
Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of two teams fighting for the state championship of
Texas has an obvious appeal, but the hatred that lasts a lifetime
grows out of competition. In basketball, the prospect of playing
Dallas never has caused the Rockets to foam at the mouth, because
the Mavericks are rarely contenders, and the series has been so
one-sided.
</P>
<P>
   After 24 seasons without a playoff team, the Rangers had their
breakthrough in 1996. As fate would have it, they met the Yankees
in each of their three appearances, never advancing to the next
round, winning one game while losing nine.
</P>
<P>
   Without comparing which city has suffered the most, the Astros
twice were within three outs of the World Series in 1980, and they
blew their next best chance against the Mets in 1986, losing the
sixth game of the National League Championship Series in 16
innings.
</P>
<P>
   You get the feeling Texas teams should not be required to play
New York teams in the playoffs. Perhaps Bud Selig can look into
this matter as his next miracle.
</P>
<P>
   It is Selig who will approve the annual pairing of the Astros
and Rangers for 2001, a Space Odyssey. Selig gave his marker this
week to the rival owners, Drayton McLane Jr. and Tom Hicks.
</P>
<P>
   The matchup has been close to an obsession with McLane since
baseball adopted interleague play four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that will be one of the best rivalries in baseball,''
Drayton has said. ``That was (always) the goal. We're really the
only natural, connected rivals that have not yet played. And we're
all disappointed we haven't gotten it solved up until now. But it
really looks promising, and I think it will bring a new dimension,
just as we're seeing in these other metropolitan cities.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Cubs and White Sox have competed for customers
and media space for most of a century; the Yankees and Mets, the
Dodgers and Angels for roughly 40 years. The Texas teams will be
starting from scratch, unless you see major significance in the
fact that in exhibition games the record is a tie, 6-6-1.
</P>
<P>
   McLane has been a persistent force in getting this deal done,
receiving an exemption that lets the teams play whether the Rangers
remain in the AL West or move to the AL Central.
</P>
<P>
   The timing is less than perfect, given Houston's nose dive and
the struggle of the Rangers to rise above .500. Both are in last
place in their divisions. The teams also have in common the
following: Interstate 45. Nolan Ryan. New ballparks.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros had a head start, arriving on the scene in 1962. The
Rangers came along 10 years later, having been blocked partly by
the political maneuvering of Judge Roy Hofheinz, who resisted
having a team in North Texas that would cut into Houston's radio
network.
</P>
<P>
   You doubt such stalwarts as Jeff Bagwell and Craig Biggio or
such newcomers as Julio Lugo and Richard Hidalgo quickly will
capture the spirit of this rivalry. For one thing, how much could
they know about the Metroplex?
</P>
<P>
   I mean, if Dallas is such a swell place to live, how come its
baseball team is in Arlington and its football team wound up in a
town called Irving?
</P>
<P>
   Bring 'em on.

It's a natural
<TEXT>
<P>
   Commissioner on verge of allowing Astros, Rangers to meet
annually
</P>
<P>
   By CARLTON THOMPSON
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ According to a published report, the Astros and Texas
Rangers have been given the status of natural geographic rivals and
will play each other at least six times during the 2001 season,
regardless of any realignment that might take place.
</P>
<P>
   That might be the case, but Astros owner Drayton McLane Jr. said
nothing has been finalized.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commissioner (Bud Selig) has not told me that it's a done
deal,'' McLane said. ``You'll have to check with him on that. If he
tells you it's a done deal, call me so I'll know. In baseball,
nothing is done until it is done.''
</P>
<P>
   Selig has the authority to put the Astros and Rangers on the
field during the regular season under expanded powers that allow
him to act in the best interest of the game. McLane and Rangers
owner Tom Hicks believe playing each other during the regular
season is in the best interest of their franchises, and Selig
agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely,'' Selig said. ``The Rangers and the Astros should
play. And frankly, we've already gone one step further. They ought
to be described as a natural geographical rivalry, like you have
with the Mets-Yankees, Cubs-White Sox and so on.''
</P>
<P>
   Teams paired on baseball's natural rivals list will play each
other each season even after the division matchups begin to rotate
for interleague play.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way it is, we don't get to play our natural rival, and
we're trying to reconcile that,'' McLane said. ``The commissioner
has said that he is going to try to make it happen, and I hope it
does.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's crazy that we're in the same state and haven't played
each other in a regular-season game. I'd like to see it happen, but
it's still in the discussion stages. Nothing is set. Nothing moves
instantly in baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Astros manager Larry Dierker is excited about the thought of
Texas' two teams playing during the regular season, but he wonders
how it will impact the shaky integrity of the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would be good for the Astros and good for the
Rangers, but we already have a convoluted schedule,'' Dierker said.
``It's not a fair schedule in terms of making the playoffs if
you're playing teams that the other teams in your division aren't
playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the idea of us playing the Rangers, but I wish they
could come up with something simple, elegant and fair. I don't know
how you do that with 30 teams. This would just increase the
likelihood that the schedule would be unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   Astros righthander Chris Holt, who is from Dallas, hopes the
possibility of a home-and-home series between the Astros and
Rangers becomes a reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd definitely like that,'' said Holt, who lives in Dallas
during the offseason. ``I'd be looking forward to the chance to get
to play at home. It would be great if they'd allow us to do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the only teams that don't get to play their natural
rivals. I think it would be great for the state of Texas and great
for the game. Hopefully, it will get done.''

 AN ALTERNATIVE AIMS FOR AUTHENTICITY  &HT;     By MARC SANDALOW 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ No one doubts consumer activist Ralph Nader will
beat Jello Biafra this weekend for the Green Party's presidential
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   And it's taken for granted that Northern California, with its
legion of liberal and disaffected voters, will be a Nader
stronghold this November.
</P>
<P>
   The hard questions about Nader are much more basic: Why is he
running for president, and could his candidacy cost Vice President
Al Gore the election?
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I worried about taking votes away from Gore? No.'' said
Nader, who has added universal health care, public financing of
elections, licensing of gun owners, withdrawal from the World Trade
Organization, and a one-third cut in the defense budget to his
familiar agenda of consumer protection. ``I'm worried about Gore
taking votes away from me.''
</P>
<P>
   Nader is serious. In fact, Nader is alway serious.
</P>
<P>
   More than three decades after his bestselling book, ``Unsafe at
Any Speed,'' shook the sensibilities of the nation's auto industry,
Nader is traipsing to every state in the union, sleeping on
supporters' couches and riding in the back of crowded airplanes to
painstakingly  &LR; take on the political mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't 17 cents worth of difference'' between Gore and
Texas Gov. George W. Bush,'' Nader said in an interview. ``Bush and
Gore are competing for the presidency to see who will take the
marching orders from their corporate paymasters.''
</P>
<P>
   A graduate of Princeton University and Harvard Law School, Nader
is not so caught up in his quest as to believe he has a chance to
win. His purpose is to establish the Greens as a ``significant
third party'' that will qualify for federal matching funds, and
serve as a ``lever to pull the Democratic Party to the left, or
make it shrink year by year.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If (Gore) doesn't want to compete on the agenda that I am
running on, he has to incur the consequences,'' Nader said.
</P>
<P>
   There is purpose, but no joy in Nader's words. He is driven by
goals and displays no pleasure in engaging in politics.
</P>
<P>
   During a news conference Thursday at the Washington headquarters
of the International Brotherhood of Teamster _ where union
President James Hoffa showered him in praise _ Nader didn't crack a
smile for the first 28 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by a collection of brawny men who looked like they
subsist on cigars and steaks, the 66-year-old consumer crusader,
who looks like he favors strained spinach and wheat germ, finally
allowed the faintest of grins when he talked about the restaurant
his parents owned many years back in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ``They used to say when you went into Nader's restaurant you
paid a nickel for a cup of coffee and got 10 minutes of political
discussion,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nader is intent on giving the country an earful between now and
November. Four years ago _ and only at the urging of others, he
insists _ Nader allowed his name to be used by the Green Party as
its presidential candidate, spending less than $5,000 and making
almost no campaign appearances.
</P>
<P>
   This time, he expects to raise $5 million with the help of
celebrity backers like Willie Nelson, Susan Sarandon, Phil Donahue,
Linda Ronstadt, Warren Beatty, the Indigo Girls and Pearl Jam.
</P>
<P>
   By sundown Friday, he will have visited all 50 states in his
quest to give voters a true alternative.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, the American people are going to fall asleep watching
the drab debate the dreary,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His message contains equal parts liberalism, socialism and
populism: American workers earn less money and work longer hours;
corporate greed deprives the poor of health care; and elections are
for sale, as corporate America has infested the political system,
creating a ``democracy gap'' that divides citizens from their
government.
</P>
<P>
   While Nader has long railed against the corporate powers, he
holds particular contempt for Democratic politicians who raise
substantial sums from big business and hew toward the political
center.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, he says, has ``broken more of his written promises than
any politician in modern history.''
</P>
<P>
   California Gov. Gray Davis, Nader told the Bay Guardian last
month, is a ``cash register politician'' who should be ``indicted
for extortion.''
</P>
<P>
   Nader himself has become wealthy over the course of his
anti-corporate crusade. He is worth $3.9 million, according to a
recent report by the Washington Post, enriched by smart investments
in high technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Number one, they're not monopolists,'' he told the Post,
defending his investments, ``And number two, they don't produce
land mines, napalm, weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course being rich hasn't changed his spartan lifestyle. Nader
rents an apartment near Washington's Dupont Circle, owns a small
black and white TV, and hasn't owned a car in 40 years. The money,
he says, helps finance his quests.
</P>
<P>
   So what of the prospects of his protest candidacy taking votes
away from Democrats and handing the election to Bush?
</P>
<P>
   So far, the polling is inconclusive. A Field Poll released this
week showed Nader drawing 7 percent of the vote in California, but
not affecting the dynamic of the race between Gore and Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The closer the race gets, the less likely voters are to cast
ballots for a third party alternative.
</P>
<P>
   However, Republican strategists believe Nader may be just the
advantage they need in a close election.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the Nader vote is coming straight out of the Democrat's
hide,'' said GOP pollster Stephen Kinney. ``Bush is in the ballgame
to take the West Coast, thanks to Nader to a great degree.''
</P>
<P>
   Nader points out that it is not a ``zero sum game.''
</P>
<P>
   While he acknowledges he could cost Gore some votes, most people
who vote for him for president will cast a ballot for a Democrat
for Congress, boosting the chances of Democrats to regain control
of the House, he said.
</P>
<P>
   It is very uncommon for third-party candidates to alter a
presidential election. One has to go back to 1912, when Teddy
Roosevelt ran as a Bull Moose progressive, taking votes from
Republican William Howard Taft and throwing the election to
Democrat Woodrow Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   The Green Party will nominate its candidate this weekend.
Nader's competitors include Jello Biafra, the former lead singer
for the punk rock group The Dead Kennedys, who ran  &LR; finished fourth
in the 1979 San Francisco mayor's race, and Stephen Gaskin, the
founder of The Farm, which at one time was the largest hippie
community in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Nader's chances of becoming president may be no greater than
those of Biafra or Gaskin. But his chances of enlivening the debate
are significant.
</P>
<P>
   ``This campaign really can't lose,'' he said. ``If America's
working people are taken for granted, then America's working
families will be taken.''

<P>
   HOUSTON _ During the last week of spring training, the Los
Angeles Dodgers targeted late June as the time teams would know
where they stood and what they would need for a second-half run at
the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Through the evaluation, the Dodgers figured reliever Alan Mills
or utility infielder Jose Vizcaino were expendable and decided that
with Geronimo Berroa's injury, Jim Leyritz's right-handed power bat
was a must.
</P>
<P>
   Questions remain about the leadoff and center-field spots, the
closer's role and whether the Dodgers will get production out of
the fourth and fifth starters in the rotation. But those are
questions that must be answered and they'll likely be answered
internally. And that's when the Dodgers will know whether they have
all the parts to make a run at the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think all the pieces to the puzzle are here, but you never
know what (management) is going to do by the July 31 (trade)
deadline,'' Dodgers reliever Jeff Shaw said. ``They may go out and
pick somebody else up, another pitcher. There's only a couple of
question marks. Arizona has played well at home (25-10) and they
have not run away from us. It's going to be a jockeying thing
here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers withstood injuries to right-hander Kevin Brown,
third baseman Adrian Beltre and Kevin Elster, who has since lost
his starting shortstop job and is in a platoon with Alex Cora.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers will get healthier Monday when catcher Todd Hundley
should return. But no one knows whether center fielder Devon White
will return from a partially torn left rotator cuff or whether
he'll need season-ending surgery.
</P>
<P>
   There was also the distraction of the impending suspensions, but
even so, the Dodgers are 2 games behind Arizona in the National
League West.
</P>
<P>
   But it's hardly time to make the big push. That happens in a
month when teams go through another evaluation period in
preparation for the July 31 trading deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you have to wait and see for the next month or so and
see how teams load up and that will help determine what we need to
do,'' Dodgers right fielder Shawn Green said. ``You have to see
who's available. Starting now, it becomes a lot more clear as each
week goes by. There's no telling what's going to happen in our
division the next month.''
</P>
<P>
   But that could prove to be a problem for the Dodgers. While
Arizona and Colorado have the organizational depth to make a
blockbuster deal at the trading deadline, the Dodgers fall short.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I know, (general manager) Kevin (Malone) is always
working the phones, but the (minor-league) system is still not
where it needs to be, so there's not a lot of depth to where you
can talk about moving some of them,'' said manager Davey Johnson.
``It's a couple years behind to where you have the insurance
policies at Triple-A to have all the parts.''
</P>
<P>
   Leyritz, or Berroa, provide the right-handed bat off the bench
that makes opposing managers choose between facing Dave Hansen or,
at this time, Leyritz. But Shaw has blown six of 18 save chances
and is no longer the end-all, be-all closer. Instead, he'll get
help from Mike Fetters, Terry Adams and Matt Herges.
</P>
<P>
   White's uncertain status has turned center field into a platoon
among Todd Hollandsworth and F.P. Santangelo and left the Dodgers
without their choice for leadoff hitter.
</P>
<P>
   And the fourth and fifth spots in the rotation, occupied by
Carlos Perez and Orel Hershiser, remain suspect. Perez is 4-3, but
he's won once since May 3. Hershiser's lone win came during the
nostalgic home opener, and he's made only four starts and has a
10.80 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always believe in having two aces on a team, and the way
Chan Ho (Park) is pitching, he's proven he can be an ace,'' said
Dodgers left fielder Gary Sheffield, knowing Kevin Brown's status
as an ace is a given. ``But you have to go out and prove you can do
it. You can have the stuff all day long, but you have to be able to
do it and execute.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ On Saturday morning the Los Angeles Red Line, long
derided as the subway to nowhere, will at last be a subway to
somewhere: from downtown to suburban San Fernando Valley, to be
precise.
</P>
<P>
   The opening of the last 6.3 miles of track under the Hollywood
hills will complete the most expensive subway in the nation's
history, 17.4 miles at a cost of more than $4.5 billion, originally
planned as the first stretch of a more extensive system.
</P>
<P>
   But as it turns out, the start of service to North Hollywood
marks an end as well as a beginning, and the city's first subway
line will almost certainly be its last. Fifteen years of
construction delays, accidents, cost overruns and a changed
political climate have led voters to block further use of local
sales tax revenue for subway construction, and forced leaders to
look elsewhere for mass transit solutions to growing problems with
traffic and urban sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, on the very day the three new subway stops open, the
Metropolitan Transportation Authority will introduce the next big
proposal: 80 express buses outfitted with transponders that signal
wire loops in the pavement to hold green lights (or shorten red
ones) so buses can speed through intersections.
</P>
<P>
   The new service, the most extensive use of such new technology
in the nation, will begin on major thoroughfares that link up with
the subway: Ventura Boulevard in the San Fernando Valley and
Wilshire Boulevard from the Pacific Ocean in Santa Monica to the
city of Montebello, 26 miles to the east.
</P>
<P>
   Transportation officials hope to lure at least 100,000 riders a
day to the completed subway line, a trickle in a county that has 10
million residents and 6 million motor vehicles. Since ground was
broken for the subway in 1986, bus ridership on the city's
transportation system, the nation's most crowded, has fallen from
about 500 million passengers a year to fewer than 400 million as
money has been shifted to pay for subway construction and fares
have risen to $1.35 from 50 cents.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they get 100,000 riders a day, given the billions that have
been spent, that would flunk any cost-benefit analysis that we
could imagine,'' said Peter Gordon, a professor of urban and
regional planning at the University of Southern California who is a
longtime subway critic. ``So it's hard to take the project
seriously as a transportation project. It's a pork-barrel jobs
project and a political project.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crowning insanity,'' Gordon added, ``is that there are
still toilet-trained adults walking around who say: `Isn't this
cool? Haven't we done a good thing?'''
</P>
<P>
   The new subway is undeniably cool, with quiet,
stainless-steel-skinned trains whooshing through twin tunnels in
the Santa Monica Mountains, at their deepest 900 feet below
Mulholland Drive.
</P>
<P>
   Each new station is designed to be an architectural jewel, with
visual motifs representing each neighborhood's history. For
example, ceilings in the North Hollywood stop are painted in
concentric rings of soft yellows, orange and green, a testament to
the area's citrus-growing past.
</P>
<P>
   A raft of dignitaries, including Mayor Richard Riordan, are
expected at the dedication on Friday, but even the subway's biggest
boosters strike an ambivalently celebratory note.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do I feel?'' asked Rep. Julian Dixon, an 11-term Democrat
from central Los Angeles who helped win federal money for the
project after some Los Angeles politicians tried to block it. ``I'm
glad that we now have the beginnings of a comprehensive rail system
that has meaningful transportation destinations. But I'm
disappointed that there's a prohibition on local money, and I think
ultimately we're going to have to re-examine that issue because
cars on the streets and congestion are a growing problem that has
to be dealt with.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Long a dream of former Mayor Tom Bradley, the subway was
enthusiastically embraced by the establishment before falling
victim to infighting, route changes and seemingly endless setbacks,
from the giant sinkhole that opened on Hollywood Boulevard in 1995
to the deaths of three construction workers in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   When construction began, the mix of hard rock and soft shale
under the mountains made digging difficult; at one point a boring
machine was stuck for weeks. By 1998, cost overruns and a
threatened cutoff of federal money led to the scrapping of planned
extensions to East Los Angeles and central Los Angeles and a
planned light rail line to Pasadena, leaving just the 17-mile Red
Line.
</P>
<P>
   The Pasadena line has since been revived, and is to be finished
by 2003. The overall system also includes two surface light rail
lines.
</P>
<P>
   For several years, transit experts have been pressing for
enhanced bus service. The new express bus, dubbed Metro Rapid, is a
first test of such options; if it proves successful, officials hope
to expand it.
</P>
<P>
   In the pilot project, which officials call a ``rubber-tire
railway,'' a radio transmitter underneath special low-riding buses
sends a signal that can turn a red light at an approaching
intersection green, or hold a green light for up to 10 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Each bus' signal identifies it by number, and the coded
information is transmitted through copper wire and fiber-optic
cable to the command center of the city's Department of
Transportation. If a bus is late, the computer tells the light to
wait.
</P>
<P>
   Some rider groups oppose the new bus service, contending that it
is not extensive enough and that it will result in the elimination
of some existing express bus service in the San Fernando Valley.
Others worry about the effect on north-south cross traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something we're definitely going to monitor,'' said
John E. Fisher, an assistant general manager of the transportation
department. ``It could be a possible minor problem on Wilshire, but
we don't believe that an extra five seconds will be much of an
impediment. And all traffic on the east-west streets will get the
benefit if a green light gets lengthened for the bus.''

 ASIAN PRESBYTERIANS AT ODDS WITH RELIGION'S LIBERAL TRADITION  &HT;     By DON LATTIN 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ At first glance, Immanuel Presbyterian Church
seems like a brick-and-mortar testament to ethnic diversity, a
place where Caucasians, Koreans, Filipinos, blacks and Latinos come
together for Sunday worship.
</P>
<P>
   Look a little deeper, however, and you'll find a Sunday morning
apartheid undermining the foundations of the Presbyterian Church
(USA), one of the nation's most established mainline denominations.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, thousands of Presbyterians from across the United
States will gather in Southern California for the denomination's
annual policymaking convention. But the real future of the
organization, which has a strong liberal Protestant tradition, will
not be decided in cavernous convention halls, but in multiracial
congregations like Immanuel, located in the sprawling Koreatown
district of downtown Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   This classic Gothic church, built in 1922 for a huge Caucasian
congregation that disappeared decades ago, stands at ground zero of
an evangelical Christian revival exploding across Asian American
neighborhoods in Southern California. Here at Immanuel, the largest
congregation of worshippers may be Korean speakers, but they do not
belong to the 2.5 million-member Presbyterian Church (USA).
Instead, they belong to a conservative Korean American denomination
that rents space.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, mainline Presbyterian leaders have been trying
to attract ethnic minorities, part of continuing attempts to
reverse a steady membership decline. But the multicultural crusade,
favored by liberals and conservatives alike, has hit a theological
roadblock.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Asian American Christians sought by Presbyterians
are conservative evangelicals who oppose the denomination's liberal
leanings _ including measures to ordain gay ministers and allow
``holy union'' ceremonies for same-sex couples.
</P>
<P>
   Immanuel is more ethnically diverse than most of the nation's
Presbyterian congregations. It attracts about 160 Caucasian and
Filipino worshippers to its English-language service on Sunday, and
60 Latinos for Spanish services.
</P>
<P>
   But the truly thriving flock of Presbyterians gathering below
Immanuel's stained-glass windows and spectacular chandeliers is its
tenants _ Yul Lin Mun Korean Presbyterian Church.
</P>
<P>
   The Korean-speaking congregation, led by the Rev. Hung Sung
Park, has quadrupled in size since it began meeting here in 1993,
and it now packs the main sanctuary with more than 1,000
worshippers for its 1 p.m. Sunday service. This is such a devout
flock that around 100 members also show up every weekday for 6 a.m.
sunrise prayers.
</P>
<P>
   Yul Lin Mun, which means ``Open Door,'' is part of the Korean
American Presbyterian Church, which does not ordain women and views
homosexuality as inherently sinful.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's against the Bible,'' said Park, speaking through an
interpreter. ``Churches should not bend to society.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Caucasian pastor of Immanuel, the Rev. Frank
Alton, has gotten used to the Sunday morning segregation at his
sanctuary and to renting space to a congregation that dwarfs his
own flock.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first few years I was here, I was very intense about
trying to bring us all together,'' Alton said. ``But they're not
used to mixing with other groups.''
</P>
<P>
   Korean Christian churches are blossoming across the Golden
State, with Southern California home to an estimated 700 Korean
congregations.
</P>
<P>
   They are the fruits of labors of 19th century Presbyterian
missionaries in Korea. Through luck, clever planning or the power
of the Holy Spirit, these missionaries from the United States
arrived at just the right moment in that nation's history.
</P>
<P>
   More than anywhere else in Asia, Presbyterianism took root in
Korea. Some say the Protestant faith dovetails nicely with
Confucian values in traditional Korean society, along with a
respect for elders and an orderly worship style that's not too
expressive.
</P>
<P>
   Today, in an evangelical twist on East meets West, many Korean
Americans see themselves as the true missionaries of Christ,
destined to bring a spiritually adrift America back to its
religious heritage.
</P>
<P>
   At Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena, nearly a third of
the conservative school's 3,000 students are of Korean heritage _
an ethnic explosion that has occurred in just the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We regret that America is being de-Christianized by the forces
of secularism,'' said Professor Seyoon Kim, a New Testament scholar
at Fuller. ``Korean Christians pray for the revival of Christian
faith in America and Europe. We see this as part of our mission.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, the Presbyterian Church (USA) convenes its weeklong
General Assembly in Long Beach, an annual policymaking convention
of voting delegates from across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Their first order of business is to elect a new assembly
``moderator,'' and two Korean Americans are among the four
candidates for the key post.
</P>
<P>
   Youngil Cho, a church elder from Raleigh, N.C., or Syngman Rhee,
a professor at Union Theological Seminary in Richmond, Va., would
be the first Korean American to hold the office.
</P>
<P>
   Both men came to the United States in the aftermath of the
Korean War _ and could assume the moderator's post this weekend, on
the 50th anniversary of a Cold War conflict that is only now
winding down.
</P>
<P>
   Among the issues facing this General Assembly are the two
controversies fueling a fiery debate between liberals and
evangelicals in the Presbyterian church and in other mainline
Protestant denominations _ gay marriage and the ordination of
homosexuals as pastors and church elders.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Cho said he opposes the ordination of gays and
lesbians, as well as ``holy union'' ceremonies for homosexual
couples. ``But we welcome everybody to church,'' he said. ``We are
all sinners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Koreans are committed to the Lord and doing what God wants,''
said Cho, the more conservative of the two Korean-born candidates.
``We must believe the Bible.''
</P>
<P>
   Rhee, a former president of the liberal-leaning National Council
of Churches, could not be reached for comment. But in a prepared
statement, he promises a ``ministry of reconciliation'' to bring
together the increasingly factious denomination.
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent survey of Latino, African American and
Korean American members of this predominantly white denomination,
Korean Americans were most likely to disapprove of gay couples (95
percent), to call themselves ``born again'' (75 percent) and to
believe in hell (82 percent).
</P>
<P>
   The Korean Americans' traditional views on sex and marriage have
produced something of a conundrum for liberal Presbyterians _ who
are pushing for both racial diversity and a more tolerant policy
toward gays and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We strongly believe in developing racially inclusive churches,
but every time we succeed on that front, there's another vote
against us (on gay rights issues),'' said Pamela Byers of San
Francisco, executive director of the Covenant Network of
Presbyterians, a liberal lobbying group in the denomination.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime Korean Presbyterian ministers across the state say
their members have little interest in the gay rights debate and
other social justice issues that now consume the Presbyterian
Church (USA).
</P>
<P>
   ``Korean American Christians in the Bay Area are focused more on
moral and ethical issues,'' said the Rev. Myong Bae Choi, who has
pastored the 155-member Alameda Korean Presbyterian Church since
1986. ``They stress more their children's education and good moral
conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   The largest Korean-speaking congregation in the Presbyterian
Church (USA) is in Southern California. Torrance First Presbyterian
holds Sunday services for about 4,000 adults and children at a
sprawling complex that brings together a converted warehouse,
parking lots and another large building with a white arch. It all
looks more like a community college campus than a church.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the PC-USA ordains homosexual pastors or blesses gay
unions, most Korean American churches will reconsider being a part
of the denomination,'' said the Rev. Michael Hwang, an associate
pastor at the Torrance church.
</P>
<P>
   Hwang's fast-growing congregation has prospered as Korean
Americans in Los Angeles have climbed the economic ladder and moved
out of Koreatown. About 1,000 members of Torrance Presbyterian now
live on the posh hillsides of the Palos Verdes Peninsula, which
rises above this hazy South Bay  &LR; suburb like a beacon of upward
mobility.
</P>
<P>
   Hwang, who plans to help out at the opening worship service at
the General Assembly meeting this weekend, had not even heard of
homosexuality when he came here from Korea in 1981 at the age of
22.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe there were homosexuals in Korea, but nobody told me
about them,'' he said. ``Our culture is very closed. We don't talk
publicly about personal issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Korean immigrant community is centered around the
church,'' said Hwang. ``Christian history, for us, is only 200
years old. As newborn Christians, we don't know much about liberal
theology, but our hearts are pure and evangelical.''
</P>
<P>
   Across town, at Immanuel, Alton has a slightly different take on
the Korean churches.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels like the Caucasian church back in the 1950s,'' he
said. ``They're ethnically homogeneous, and the services are very
similar. The church works like in the '50s. It's where you go to
network. They're aligned with business interests, but they're not
getting politically involved with social justice issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Alton said the suburban flight in the Korean community also
reminds him of the 1950s. It picked up in the aftermath of riots
that swept Los Angeles eight years ago _ sparked by the verdict in
the Rodney King case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still call it `Koreatown,' but the population is only about
15 percent Korean,'' Alton said. ``There are more Latinos and
African Americans, but the property ownership is more and more
Korean.''
</P>
<P>
   Presbyterians, who trace their roots back to John Calvin, the
16th century Swiss church reformer, were among the first Protestant
churches to firmly establish themselves in colonial America.
</P>
<P>
   Its largest denomination, the Presbyterian Church (USA), dates
back to an association of churches organized in Philadelphia in
1706, and it is the product of at least 10 denominational mergers
over the past 250 years.
</P>
<P>
   But this mainstay of the American ecumenical movement faces a
serious problem. Since the 1960s, it has been losing about 30,000
members a year.
</P>
<P>
   To stop the exodus, church leaders have embarked on an ambitious
campaign to attract ethnic minorities _ including Asian Americans,
Latinos and African Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Today, these ``racial ethnic church members'' comprise only
about 5 percent of the overwhelmingly white denomination. But the
goal is to increase minority membership to 10 percent by 2005 and
20 percent by 2020.
</P>
<P>
   There has been some success on that front in the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   In the San Francisco Presbytery, the last five churches to join
the denomination have had ethnic congregations _ a Latino church in
Oakland, an Indonesian congregation in San Francisco, a Korean
flock in Fremont and two Chinese churches in Walnut Creek and
Fremont.
</P>
<P>
   ``They bring in a whole new set of perceptions and
understandings about how to be a Christian in the world,'' said the
Rev. Jim Glasse, a retired Presbyterian minister in Orinda who
helped the churches join the denomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all wrestling with the delicate and difficult balance
of retaining ethnic identity and becoming part of the American
scene,'' Glasse said. ``They can't all become Scot-Irish
Presbyterians.''
</P>
<P>
   The ethnic infusion, he said, has been a morale booster to a
denomination in decline. ``The conventional wisdom is that mainline
denominations don't make sense anymore,'' he said. ``It's
reassuring that somebody still wants us.''
</P>
<P>
   Church growth experts say Asian Americans could be the secret to
stopping the mainline Presbyterian decline _ especially in
California.
</P>
<P>
   ``If spiritual revival has occurred among any group of people in
the United States in the past decade, it is undeniably among
Asians,'' reports the Barna Research Group, an evangelical
pollster.
</P>
<P>
   The number of Asian Americans calling themselves ``born-again''
Christians has jumped from 5 percent in 1991 to 27 percent in
February 2000, according to a recent report by Barna. That is the
percentage of Asian Americans who say they have a personal
commitment to Jesus Christ and expect to reach heaven because they
confessed their sins and accepted Christ as their savior.
</P>
<P>
   You can see this revival, up close and personal, at Young Nak
Presbyterian Church of Los Angeles, whose 7,500 members make it the
biggest congregation outside Korea.
</P>
<P>
   It is the largest of 263 churches in yet another Korean
denomination, the 29,000-member Korean Presbyterian Church in
America.
</P>
<P>
   Young Nak rises above the Los Angeles River, a trickle of water
in a ridiculously wide concrete canal. It is tucked between
Chinatown and Lincoln Heights, a poor Latino neighborhood northeast
of downtown Los Angeles. Its complex of cinderblock buildings takes
up an entire city block _ a fenced-off island of Korean faith and
culture in this endless multicultural metropolis.
</P>
<P>
   Two nights ago, the place was buzzing with midweek activity.
Inside the main building, the sweet and spicy smell of kim chee, a
Korean cabbage dish, filled the fellowship hall as ladies donned
choir robes and their husbands chowed down.
</P>
<P>
   Upstairs, well-dressed couples filed into a huge sanctuary for
Wednesday night worship. Across the parking lot, on the other side
of the block, a youth group getting ready for a summer mission to
Mexico barbecued sausages and salt-covered tri-tips.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Paul Kang, who ministers to young adults, sat down with
a plate of barbecue and explained how California's Korean Christian
revival is really not all that complicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone comes here from Korea. He knows no one, but there's a
pastor waiting to meet him at the airport, ready to help him find
an apartment,'' he said. ``They might be Buddhists, Christians or
nonbelievers. It doesn't matter. We call it evangelism.''

DREIFORT SUFFERS THIRD STRAIGHT LOSS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Chan Ho Park has done his part, becoming a nice
complement for staff ace Kevin Brown in the starting rotation. But
for the Los Angeles Dodgers to make a playoff run, they need three
dependable starters.
</P>
<P>
   Darren Dreifort is supposed to be that third guy and six weeks
ago he was poised to do it. Then, something changed and no one
quite knows what.
</P>
<P>
   For the fifth time in six starts Dreifort lost, giving up three
first-inning runs as the Dodgers dropped the series finale Thursday
to Houston 6-3 at Enron Field, ending the club's winning streak at
three games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was probably overthrowing a little bit (in the first
inning),'' Dreifort said. ``It wasn't that I wasn't comfortable the
first inning. I didn't get the ball where it needed to be. It's not
that big of a deal. You come out, you have a lot of energy. That's
the way (stuff) goes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody that comes out is going to have adrenaline. It cost
me, it cost us, three runs in the first inning.''
</P>
<P>
   The first-inning meltdown surprised pitching coach Claude
Osteen, who said Dreifort was phenomenal in the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   But that changed the moment Dreifort stepped on the mound. He
issued a pair of one-out walks before Lance Berkman hit a three-run
shot onto the home run porch in left-center field.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's definitely having early-inning problems,'' Osteen said.
``He didn't look comfortable out there to me. The stuff he had
warming up in the pen, the control he had, it wasn't the same as he
took out there in the first inning. Maybe the stuff was, but he
never seemed to get settled. He was all over the place.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Dreifort allowed five runs, only three _ via the homer _
were earned. He pitched seven innings, walked three and struck out
three.
</P>
<P>
   It's hardly what the Dodgers expected of Dreifort, especially
after he pitched a two-hit shutout May 12 in St. Louis. But since
then Dreifort has won just once, a June 7 victory at Texas. He's
allowed at least three earned runs in seven of his last eight
starts and has lost three straight to fall to 4-6.
</P>
<P>
   The defense also didn't help keep this one close. With runners
on second and third and one out in the sixth, Julio Lugo hit a soft
liner to Mark Grudzielanek at second. But Grudzielanek misjudged
the speed of the ball and it went through his legs, allowing two
runs to score and giving the Astros a 5-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to keep that ball in there and make a play and get an
out,'' Grudzielanek said. ``That probably cost us the game, or a
chance to win it, at least. I came up. It was a changeup and it
kind of deceived me a little bit. You can't do that. You can't let
it go through your legs and to the outfield.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers trailed 6-1 in the ninth but got the tying run to
the plate. Gary Sheffield led off the inning with a solo homer, his
24th, and the Dodgers loaded the bases with none out. But catcher
Chad Kreuter grounded into a double play to kill the rally and give
the Astros the 6-3 win. &QL;

INDIAN SPIRITUALIST VISITS LOS ANGELES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT MONROE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ She's known as Amma or, more descriptively, ``the
hugging saint.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday morning, the Indian spiritualist likened to Mother
Teresa and Mahatma Gandhi began her day with a grand entry into the
Warner Center Marriott's main ballroom. White-robed initiates lined
her path as some 300 devotees uttered a rhythmic Sanskrit chant of
salutation.
</P>
<P>
   After a brief meditation, the diminutive woman from the Indian
state of Kerala began the ritual of the (italics on) darshan
(italics off), a blessing given with a hug. She would stop only
when the last person came before her.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, when an estimated 2,000 people came to greet
her, she had hugged until 2:30 a.m. In San Francisco the night
before that, she hugged until 4:30 a.m., with some of the blessing
recipients walking away in tears -- a scene repeated thousands of
times a week in halls all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just trembling,'' said Anne Jones, a Simi Valley resident,
after embracing Amma, also called Ammachi -- names that mean
``mother.'' Jones gasped as she tried to describe the rush she
felt, like a moment of religious epiphany mixed with a roller
coaster thrill.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just such a warm tender embrace,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The hug contains Amma's message and says all about her appeal,
her followers said as the spiritualist held court Thursday on her
second day in Los Angeles. Amma is visiting the area in a 10-city
swing through America, a tour she has taken every summer since
1987.
</P>
<P>
   In every one of those summers, the numbers coming to see her
have grown steadily, said organizers of her U.S. tours. Between
hugs, Ammachi said through a translator that more people are
looking for the simple goals of peace and love.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of freedom in this country, but it's only a
physical freedom,'' she said. ``The heart is being imprisoned.''
</P>
<P>
   Amma seeks no money on her tours, nor does she bear the message
of any religion. Nevertheless, donations have funded more than two
dozen orphanages in India and a free hospital in her home state.
Established in her name are two spiritual centers, one in San
Ramon, Calif., and the other in New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   During this year's stay in America, she will be among the
spiritual leaders of the world who will address the United Nations
General Assembly at the Millennium World Peace Summit of Religious
and Spiritual Leaders in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her appeal is growing all over because what she portrays is
unconditional love,'' said Omana Philip, an Anaheim Hills resident
who said her Christian faith was strengthened by Amma, who was
raised as a Hindu.
</P>
<P>
   Amma, born Mata Amritanandamyi, will return to the Marriott on
Sunday for a public program starting at 6:30 p.m.

 SCIENTISTS SHOW EVIDENCE OF UNDERGROUND WATER ON MARS  &HT;     By DAVID PERLMAN 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Space scientists offered powerful details Thursday to support
their theory that vast amounts of water on ancient Mars may have
disappeared underground eons ago, then resurfaced, and could even
be evident now.
</P>
<P>
   And because water is the key ingredient for life, its discovery
so near the Martian surface should shape future reconnaissance
missions as preludes to a manned search for life on the planet in
coming decades, the scientists agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the new findings will be published in next week's
issue of the journal Science, but because some content circulated
widely this week, NASA officials released the complete report
Thursday. At the same time, the researchers described their
findings at a Washington press conference carried to Space Agency
centers on television.
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle reported some of the new discoveries Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Malin, the founder of Malin Space Science Systems, a
small 12-person company in San Diego, is the star of the discovery
team, and his staff scientist, Kenneth Edgett, was his co-star at
the press conference. They are the sole authors of the new report
in Science.
</P>
<P>
   Malin's company developed the imaging camera carried aboard the
Mars Global Surveyor. The camera has been orbiting the Red Planet
since September 1997, and has already  &LR; taken more than 65,000
high-resolution pictures of its surface.
</P>
<P>
   The space agency is saying the Surveyor spacecraft's images
``could turn out to be a landmark discovery in the history of Mars
exploration.'' Edward Weiler, chief of the Office of Space Science
at NASA headquarters, called the new images ``incredibly compelling
evidence for liquid water on Mars.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The presence of liquid water on Mars has profound implications
for Astrobiology, the question of life not only in the past, but
perhaps even today,'' Weiler said. ``If life ever did develop
there, and if it survives to the present time, then these landforms
would be great places to look.''
</P>
<P>
   The discovery could rejuvenate NASA's Mars exploration program,
which lost two spacecraft flying to the planet last year. The Mars
Polar Lander, a $165 million craft, vanished just before landing in
December, and the $125 million Mars Climate Orbiter was lost in
September due to a navigational error.
</P>
<P>
   The new evidence for water near the surface, Weiler said, could
call for changes in the search strategies built into the missions
of Mars landers due to be launched as early as 2005 and 2008. It
also calls for a series of reconnaissance missions before any
consideration of manned expeditions, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In 250 of Malin's images, the pictures show an extraordinary
variety of gullies, channels, trenches and fan-shaped regions where
surging water may have dumped debris just the way flash floods on
Earth fling boulders as big as cars downstream.
</P>
<P>
   ``The features appear to be so young that they might be forming
even today,'' Malin said. ``These are new land forms that have
never been seen before on Mars, but we think we are seeing evidence
of a groundwater supply similar to an underground aquifer. The
gullies could be on the order of a million years old, or they could
have formed yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   In most of the features where water appears, it seems to have
seeped or gushed and then flowed downhill from crater rims that are
located far away from the Martian equator and closer to the
northern and southern polar regions. Scientists studying Mars from
past missions have long suspected that the dry deserts and rocky
highlands of Martian equatorial regions are far than the
less-heavily cratered areas nearer the poles where water _ it now
appears _ is a major feature.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think about the requirements for supporting life on
Mars, the key comes down to liquid water,'' said Bruce Jakosky of
the University of Colorado's Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space
Physics. ``This doesn't tell us that life does exist on Mars, but
it's the smoking gun that tells us Mars has all the elements for
life.''
</P>
<P>
   If water is emerging even now from the rims of Martian craters,
it should evaporate swiftly _ sublimate is the operative word _ but
it might still lie in liquid form only a few yards below the
surface, the scientists believe.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Carr, a planetary geologist at the Menlo Park regional
office of the U. S. Geological Survey, has been studying the
problem of water on Mars for more than 25 years. ``This is most
exciting, and quite compelling for an interpretation that water
does exist,'' he said of the Malin images.
</P>
<P>
   He noted, however, that with Martian surface temperatures as low
as 180 degrees Fahrenheit any water in the ground should be frozen
for two to four miles deep _ apparently incompatible with liquid
water existing at the surface. But the Malin images, he conceded
make the idea of flowing water ``perfectly plausible.''

RED SOX DEFEAT YANKEES, 4-2 
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ They scored 22 runs on Monday, beat Pedro Martinez on
Tuesday, and yet the Yankees walked out of here barely in second
place on Thursday night, over the cracked foundation of Fenway
Park, with nothing more than a split of the four-game series with
the Boston Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   It is the nature of the Yankees right now, an inconsistency that
is becoming the most consistent aspect of the team. Ramiro Mendoza
and Andy Pettitte might have been spectacular Monday and Tuesday,
but on Thursday night, the 22-year-old rookie Jake Westbrook was
knocked out before the end of the third inning in a 4-2 loss to the
Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Nomar Garciaparra keyed two Boston rallies with doubles, and
Ramon Martinez pitched six and two-thirds solid innings in getting
the victory for the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, now a half-game behind Boston and in a virtual tie
with Toronto, begin a three-game series Friday night in Chicago,
and once again, they will be forced to plug their injury-plagued
rotation. Ben Ford, 25, has eight major league appearances and two
professional starts after 282 relief appearances, and he will be
promoted from Class AAA Columbus to start against the White Sox.
Westbrook was informed after Thursday night's game that he is being
sent back to Columbus, as expected.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankee players became aware of a possible trade for Juan
Gonzalez after the game. Ricky Ledee, one of the players who would
go to Detroit for the slugging outfielder, was surrounded by
reporters, and his teammates whispered among themselves, asking
why. Players spoke carefully in response to news of the pending
deal.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez ``is an mvp-type player,'' said David Cone, the
Yankees' pitcher. ``We have a great clubhouse that could really
help him.''
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Posada is a friend of Ledee's and seemed sad to hear the
Yankee outfielder's name mentioned in the trade talks. But Posada
acknowledged Gonzalez's potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very special,'' Posada said. ``He's one of those people
that brings a presence every time he goes to the plate. He would
fit right in the lineup. He's a good hitter. He drives in 120-plus
runs every year, hits 30-plus home runs. We'll see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees ate, showered and dressed, unsure of who will be
playing the outfield in Chicago Friday and disappointed at the
outcome of the series here.
</P>
<P>
   ``After beating Pedro on Tuesday, we had visions of winning
three and maybe four games here,'' said Joe Torre, the Yankees'
manager. ``Winning two is a disappointment. We need to put together
a streak for confidence. I thought we had something going after
winning the first two.''
</P>
<P>
   They could have won three, but fell behind early on Thursday
night. Westbrook lasted only one and two-thirds innings in his
first start against the White Sox last week, allowing six runs. But
Westbrook came back the next day and, at the end of a one-sided
defeat, pitched two and one-third scoreless innings, and the
pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre hoped Westbrook could build off the
confidence gleaned in that second appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Westbrook did look good early on Thursday night, striking out
the leadoff hitter Jose Offerman on a called third strike before
retiring Jeff Frye and Trot Nixon for a 1-2-3 inning. The fact that
John Hirschbeck, who calls one of the most generous strike zones in
baseball, was the umpire behind home plate was good fortune for
Westbrook.
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Williams had bashed a very long two-run homer in the top
of the first inning, his 16th, and the Yankees had a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   But the Red Sox began smashing line drives in the second inning
and drove Westbrook from the mound before the end of the third.
``His fastball was good,'' Torre said. ``I think he just got in
trouble with his secondary pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra began the second with the first of two doubles
against Westbrook, and Carl Everett singled home Garciaparra and
eventually scored on a sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Frye doubled inside the first-base line with one out in the
third inning. Westbrook walked Nixon and Garciaparra pushed Frye
across with a double. Jason Grimsley quickly jumped to his feet in
the bullpen and started throwing, while Stottlemyre walked slowly
to the mound; it was evident that Westbrook's outing was going to
end soon.
</P>
<P>
   Everett was walked intentionally, and with the count 1-0 on
Brian Daubach, Grimsley nodded in the bullpen that he was ready.
The bullpen coach Tony Cloninger relayed word to Jeff Nelson, who
picked up the phone to inform Stottlemyre and Torre in the Yankees'
dugout.
</P>
<P>
   But Torre did not make a change immediately, possibly because he
had watched Grimsley walk three in a span of five hitters Wednesday
night and did not want to call on him with the bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   Daubach singled to left field, driving home Nixon with Boston's
fourth run. Ledee threw home and the ball beat Garciaparra, who
appeared to elude the tag but was called out.
</P>
<P>
   But the Yankees were down by 4-2, would never recover and took
that long walk out of Fenway after the game, into the muggy Boston
night. &QL;

 INSURANCE PAPERS LEAKED TO COMMITTEE  &HT;     By LYNDA GLEDHILL 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ A San Francisco lawyer has admitted leaking
confidential documents to a legislative committee probing the
actions of embattled Insurance Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush,
sources told The Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Department of Insurance lawyer Cindy Ossais reportedly told the
California Highway Patrol _ after being read her Miranda rights _
that she turned the controversial documents over to a former
consultant with the Assembly Insurance Committee in January.
</P>
<P>
   Ossais, a 10-year veteran with the department, has been placed
on paid administrative leave, said Dan Edwards, a spokesman for the
department.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly investigators say Ossais is a brave whistle blower, who
turned over the documents out of concern, but Quackenbush's aides
say it shows the whole investigation has been a political show.
</P>
<P>
   ``They pressed and pressed us to give them something that was
already in their possession,'' Edwards said. ``They wanted to try
to make it legitimate.''
</P>
<P>
   Ossais is expected to be a key witness Monday, when the Assembly
Insurance Committee resumes its hearings into the actions of
Quackenbush and his top aides.
</P>
<P>
   Ossais referred all questions to her attorney, Doron Weinberg,
who did not did not return calls Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators are investigating allegations that Quackenbush
coerced insurance companies into paying $12 million to two
nonprofit foundations he created. The payments allegedly allowed
the insurers to avoid paying as much as $3.7 billion in fines for
improperly handling policyholder claims after the 1994 Northridge
earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the payments to the foundations were used to promote
Quackenbush's own political agenda and that none of the money went
to earthquake victims.
</P>
<P>
   The documents provided to the committee, called market conduct
exams, are sensitive audits detailing insurers' alleged
claims-handling violations following the 1994 Northridge
earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   The exams have assumed a significant role in the deepening
political scandal surrounding Quackenbush. They deal with the same
insurance companies that were allegedly convinced to contribute to
the foundations, allegedly to avoid fines.
</P>
<P>
   The documents say state regulators found that some insurance
companies had tendencies to lowball policyholder claims and delay
payments.
</P>
<P>
   Quackenbush had refused to give the exams to the Legislature,
even though he has the power to make them public.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Assembly committee has had possession of the
documents for months, it has not used them during the
investigation, said Rich Zeiger, a spokesman for the committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe we are entitled to them as a part of our oversight
role,'' Zeiger said. ``However, we decided not to use them and no
member of the committee has seen them.''
</P>
<P>
   The former staffer who received the documents now works for a
lobbying firm in Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   While the Assembly did not do anything with the documents, a
Senate committee did release the executive summaries earlier this
month. The Department of Insurance tried to get a temporary
restraining order to block further release.
</P>
<P>
   While Sacramento Superior Court Judge Joe Gray originally denied
the department's request, late Tuesday he said he was reconsidering
that ruling.
</P>
<P>
   He said he will consider making the Senate return all copies and
provide a list of who the reports have been given to. A hearing is
scheduled for next week.
</P>
<P>
   Quackenbush had asked the California Highway Patrol _ which has
legal jurisdiction over state property _ to investigate the leaks.
</P>
<P>
   California Highway Patrol Commissioner D.O. ``Spike'' Helmick
confirmed Thursday that the investigation had turned to one person.
He said recommendations on possible criminal action will be given
to the department within the next 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Exactly to what degree charges might be involved is
questionable,'' he said. ``But I don't think she should have
released'' the documents.

 PLAY BALL, `DIMAGGIO CLIPPERS'  &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The girls who play softball at North Beach
Playground have an identity crisis.
</P>
<P>
   It's time to order new uniforms for the two 14-and-under
softball teams, but who are they?
</P>
<P>
   The girls want to be the DiMaggio Clippers, but they might have
to settle for calling themselves the North Beach Prospectors.
</P>
<P>
   When you're a kid playing softball, you don't want to mess up
your season by getting sued by some clown in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll probably order shirts with just numbers on 'em,`` says
Dan Harrington, assistant recreation director at North Beach
Playground.
</P>
<P>
   Harrington is the guy who thought up the idea of naming the
playground after North Beach's most famous native son, Joe
DiMaggio. Joe was alive then but ailing, and Harrington figured,
``Maybe we can help keep him alive, get some positive endorphines
flowing through his bloodstream.''
</P>
<P>
   But wheels grind slowly. Joe died and S.F. supervisors voted to
put his name on the playground where he and his brothers played as
kids. Then Joe's attorney Morris Engelberg sued, likening North
Beach Playground to the city dump in terms of an honor to DiMag.
</P>
<P>
   The kids didn't understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought this was a pretty cool park,'' some of the regulars
said to Harrington.
</P>
<P>
   While the legal wrangling continues, the youngsters _ and adults
_ play on at one of the city's great cultural/economic melting
pots.
</P>
<P>
   One of the ``North Beach Playground'' signs was removed recently
_ nobody knows by whom _ so only one remains.
</P>
<P>
   Never has a controversy been so noncontroversial. Not one person
in the world has stepped up to be counted with Mr. Engelberg.
</P>
<P>
   The city should put up the DiMaggio sign and take the small risk
that it might be ruled illegal. Show some Joltin' Joe and
S.F.-style chutzpah.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe, while the city awaits justice, we could name it the
``Morris Engelberg Sucks Playground.''
</P>
<P>
   THE DEFENSE hasn't had its shot yet in the big Wonder Bread
discrimination trial here in San Francisco. But the plaintiffs put
on a powerful show.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen African American men who work at Wonder Bread's S.F.
plant or in Bay Area distributing centers are claiming systematic
discrimination and asking $260 million in damages.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Willie Wilkerson was on the stand. Attorney
Angela Alioto asked Wilkerson how it felt to be an employee for 28
years and to be passed over for promotion in favor of a person who
had been at the company six months.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkerson looked at the floor for a long moment. Then he looked
up at the ceiling. His eyes were filled with tears and he finally
said, ``No human being should be treated like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge immediately called a 10-minute recess.
</P>
<P>
   ``Willie's two minutes on the stand,'' Alioto says, ``made the
struggle, the last 21/2 years of sweat, worth every second.''
</P>
<P>
   The case is expected to go to the jury in about two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   WHY RADIO station KNBR calls talk-show co-host Ralph Barbieri
``The Razor,'' I have no idea.
</P>
<P>
   Barbieri, who teams with Tom (Mr. T) Tolbert nightly, isn't one
of those throat-slitting, cheap-shot sports-radio doofuses. He's a
sensitive guy, and now the Razor has a little shaver to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody worked harder to get a kid than old Ralph. When he passed
45, unmarried and childless, his biological clock was ticking like
Big Ben. He wanted a baby.
</P>
<P>
   When his now-ex-girlfriend became pregnant, he was thrilled.
When she had an abortion, Barbieri was beyond devastated.
</P>
<P>
   But more determined than ever. Adoption didn't work, so Barbieri
went the scientific route. It's not uncommon to try to create a
child via three-way team _ sperm donor, egg donor and surrogate
mother. But the recipient of the final product is almost never a
partnerless, heterosexual male.
</P>
<P>
   Word quickly spread around the press boxes that old Ralph had
become the Nutty Professor, trying to grow a kid in a flower pot in
his basement. But it was all legit and normal.
</P>
<P>
   And complicated. It took years, as Barbieri hand-picked a
legal-medical-maternal team as well-organized as an Everest assault
group.
</P>
<P>
   Odds against success were huge. But miracles happen, and the
miracle that happened Wednesday is named Tayte (cq)  &LR; Ali Barbieri.
</P>
<P>
   Tayte is Native American for ``windy'' or ``good talker.'' It's
in the genes.
</P>
<P>
   E-MAIL VIRUS, the great modern chess game, bad guys against good
guys, dueling technology.
</P>
<P>
   To counter the recent round of virus attacks, The Chronicle
installed new filtering software.

   I don't know how many e-mail bugs have been stopped, but the
coffee tastes better.

<P>
   Change comes slowly to Mexico, the country with the world's
longest-serving ruling party.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the bloodletting of the 1910-17 revolution led to the
emergence in the 1920s of the Institutional Revolutionary Party
(PRI), power in Mexico has changed hands through backroom deals in
which the incumbent president has chosen his successor _ whose
subsequent electoral victory was a formality, achieved when
necessary by fraud.
</P>
<P>
   No longer. That makes Mexico's presidential election on July 2 a
historic event.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome is uncertain. After months of campaigning, the
latest opinion polls give only the narrowest of leads to the PRI's
Francisco Labastida over Vicente Fox of the opposition National
Action Party (PAN). The leftish Cuauhtemoc Cardenas trails in third
place.
</P>
<P>
   But if Fox has at least a chance of winning, it is also because
of a second big change. This is the first presidential election to
be supervised not by the government but by an independent institute
whose probity is accepted by all.
</P>
<P>
   Will that be enough to ensure a clean vote? A swelling chorus
has arisen recently to complain that the PRI has been up to its old
tricks, showering voters with largesse (ranging from washing
machines to bicycles and cash) and threats (to withdraw
anti-poverty funds from opposition supporters, for example).
</P>
<P>
   Such reports should be kept in perspective: even the opposition
says their effect is confined to relatively few voters, mainly in
rural areas. Even so, such tactics are worrying: in a tight
election, they may prove decisive.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing to hope for is thus that the election should
produce a clean and clear winner, relieving Mexico of protracted
dispute about the result.
</P>
<P>
   But better still if that winner were to be Fox. He is not
without flaws. He combines stubbornness with an impulsive tendency
to flip-flop on issues. Some Mexicans are offended by his rude
language; others by his militant Catholicism and his opposition to
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   But there are two overriding reasons for desiring an opposition
victory. First, it would, almost by definition, complete Mexico's
transition from one-party state to plural democracy.
</P>
<P>
   And the alternation of power would be beneficial in itself,
because many of Mexico's problems stem from the fusing by the PRI
of the functions and interests of party, state and nation.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Fox, a former businessman (and Coca-Cola manager) looks,
on balance, to be the candidate likeliest to push forward with the
reforms his country needs. That is not immediately obvious.
</P>
<P>
   However slowly, Mexico has changed much in the past 20 years,
especially under President Ernesto Zedillo. That is not least
because of the North American Free-Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which
is drawing the country's economy, and perhaps its politics, into
ever-closer association with those of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Since the currency collapse and deep recession of 1994-95,
Zedillo has started to put Mexico on the road to sustained economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
   Macroeconomic management has been less opaque than in the past.
So, too, has been the selection of the PRI's candidate: Labastida
was chosen by an open primary.
</P>
<P>
   Provided the election comes off cleanly, those changes have
increased the chance that this year Mexico will avoid the economic
or political crises that have marked the start of the past four
presidential terms _ despite some signs of economic overheating,
and worries about the possible impact of a slowing economy north of
the border.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo's record, and the PRI's adaptability, might seem to be
strong arguments for Labastida. He is an experienced politician
known for his negotiating skills, though he is not a liberal
technocrat like Zedillo.
</P>
<P>
   But change and its benefits have been distributed unequally. If
all Mexicans are to get full value from NAFTA and from economic
growth, their next president needs to complement an emerging
democracy with a market economy and a reformed state. That involves
separating political and economic power.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico is still burdened by the PRI's corporatist history: the
state let favored businessmen enrich themselves in return for
political loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   One costly result was a banking crisis which deprived most
Mexicans of credit during Zedillo's term, and left a bill of $100
billion for bailing out the banks (and some of the bankers).
</P>
<P>
   Another has been a monopolized economy. State monopolies still
control electricity distribution and oil. A privatized
near-monopoly, Telmex (whose boss, Carlos Slim, is Latin America's
richest man), has used its political clout to delay a fully
competitive telecoms market.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of mutual backscratching, Mexico needs impartial
regulation of its economy to promote competition, and deregulation
of government, and also, in some ways, its expansion: petty
officialdom still exacts its venal toll, while the state does far
too little to give its poorest citizens decent schooling and
health.
</P>
<P>
   The next government also needs to do much more to combat crime,
corruption and powerful drug gangs.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida claims to help those who suffer from change. But as
the chief beneficiary of the old ways, the PRI is unlikely to be as
vigorous in trying to abolish them as Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever wins the election will probably face a Congress divided
three ways, as it has been since 1997. Governing Mexico will thus
not be easy; reforming it harder still. That is another reason for
wishing the election to be both clear-cut and clean. &QL;

<P>
   On the face of it, the past decade has been a splendid time for
democrats. All over the world, dictatorships, whether communist or
military, have been in retreat; demand for ballot boxes, election
monitors and people who know how to run parliaments has been as hot
as for Pokemon cards.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in history, the proportion of the world's
population that lives in countries that can claim to be broadly
democratic has climbed past 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In all, some 120 out of the world's 190 or so states can now
plausibly claim to have democracies.
</P>
<P>
   If you think, with Winston Churchill, that although democracy
has its flaws, it is the least bad political system yet invented,
this offers genuine cause for celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, next week a ``World Forum on Democracy'' will meet
in Poland, organized privately by Freedom House (an American
pro-democracy think-tank) and a Polish foundation, but hosted by
the Polish government. It will be addressed by such luminaries as
Madeleine Albright, America's secretary of state, and Kofi Annan,
the secretary-general of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   At a parallel meeting, foreign ministers from more than 100
countries will discuss ways of further strengthening the democratic
cause. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (150-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 200) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   And there is even better news on the way, if you believe the
Internet enthusiasts. Direct democracy through computerized voting
at home is a long way off virtually everywhere, given still-low
levels of Internet access in most countries.
</P>
<P>
   But the Net, and associated advances in communications
technology, could soon have a beneficial effect on government, as
people begin to press for public services to be delivered or
administered online, and then to demand the same standards of
service _ speed, reliability, courtesy, innovation _ from their
local or national governments as they do from Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   If voters can force their governments to treat them like
customers, rather than just as cattle who are fed nicely every few
years when an election happens along, it will add a powerful new
pressure for democratic accountability. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,025) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   This is all moving pleasingly in the right direction. Yet there
are also forces pressing in less benign ways.
</P>
<P>
   For a start, progress is not always permanent. From time to
time, countries that were democracies, or looked like becoming
them, lapse into their old ways.
</P>
<P>
   Recently two Pacific tiddlers, the Solomon Islands and Fiji,
disappeared from Freedom House's list of electoral democracies
after coups or other mayhem. Pakistan was counted as one for a
time, albeit of a rough and not very ready sort, until General
Pervez Musharraf took over the reins of power last October.
</P>
<P>
   There is also, however, a more sinister phenomenon, one which
bears more thought than it usually gets. Freedom House and the
other organizers of next week's meetings are well aware of it.
</P>
<P>
   The celebratory number of 120 or so broad, electoral democracies
includes a considerable list of countries whose citizens are far
from free, in the true sense of the word.
</P>
<P>
   Freedom House's own rankings count only 86 countries as properly
free. Which, since more than 100 will be at the meetings, means
that there will be quite a number of impostors at the feast.
</P>
<P>
   The optimistic way of putting this is that some countries are
``in transition'' towards full democracy, and that conferences like
this, with all the public exposure and discussion that they bring,
can help jostle them along that path.
</P>
<P>
   It will persuade them that ballot boxes may be necessary for
democracy, but are far from sufficient: you also need free speech
and a free press; an independent judiciary; and, supervised by that
judiciary, the impartial enforcement of the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico is an example of a transition in progress, though it has
been painfully slow. Indonesia is finding it hard to establish
proper judging and policing overnight after decades of
dictatorship, let alone a full set of legitimate laws and a
clear-out of corruption. Yet with help, patience and encouragement,
it can be done.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed it can. But often it isn't, and willfully so. For another
good word for the many partial democracies is this: phoneys.
</P>
<P>
   They are not as phoney as the old Soviet Union, with its 99.999
percent votes for Comrade Stalin. But in some ways they are worse,
because their appearances deceive.
</P>
<P>
   And, increasingly, the suspicion must be that the deception is
deliberately designed to gain just enough respectability to attract
private foreign capital, and to qualify more readily for the public
sort, from multilateral bodies such as the IMF and the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the phoneys have been exposed. Peru, whose President
Alberto Fujimori recently rigged his (unconstitutional)
re-election, is one of them; Haiti, its democracy supposedly
restored by American intervention in 1994, is another.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is a cleverer deceiver, and has been more prone in
post-Soviet times to be given the benefit of the doubt. Now, the
doubts about its newly elected president, Vladimir Putin, are
mounting, both because of the way he was elected in March and
because of his conduct since.
</P>
<P>
   When visiting a western capital, such as Berlin last week, he
plays the democratic part. Back in Moscow, however, the script
changes and things begin to become murkier.
</P>
<P>
   Malaysia, too, is a phoney, despite its noisy shunning of the
IMF. Its prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, abides by democratic
procedures (and was re-elected in November), yet meanwhile has
imprisoned his chief rival (Anwar Ibrahim, whose wife will speak at
the Forum) on trumped up charges, has throttled the press and has
suborned the judiciary.
</P>
<P>
   Is this worse than no democracy at all?
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabwe's vote this weekend may yet prove, despite all the
violence and rigging, that the right to vote can still be made to
count. Yet it can often be worse, for the strongman, with his
rigged press and gagged courts, gains a form of international
approval _ and even money _ adding to the frustration, and perhaps
eventual violence, of his subjects.
</P>
<P>
   It is best to use words as plainly as possible. Call a phoney a
phoney. &QL;

 &UR; (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Three months after Vladimir Putin won Russia's presidency, some
ugly things have been happening in his benighted country.
</P>
<P>
   The new man, a former KGB officer, has been cracking his whip.
He has sounded belligerent towards several of Russia's former
vassal states on its rim, and shows little sign of softening
towards Chechnya, the rebel republic devastated at his command.
</P>
<P>
   He has told the leaders of the outlying regions within Russia
that they must step back into the Kremlin's line _ or else. And he
has frightened the press by resorting to the bullying of media
groups and journalists critical of the new regime.
</P>
<P>
   Most notably, the owner of the only independent nationwide
television station, Vladimir Gusinsky, was arrested earlier this
month, and freed without charge a few days later, amid
flimsy-sounding allegations of embezzlement.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually the entire country presumed that Putin, who breezily
denied foreknowledge of the arrest, simply wanted to silence the
voice of opposition. Yet, despite all this, it is still possible to
paint a less bleak picture.
</P>
<P>
   After eight years with the wayward Boris Yeltsin fitfully in
charge, Russians _ it can be argued _ need an energetic,
clear-minded leader to restore to their country some direction,
discipline and pride.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike his predecessor, Putin has a cooperative parliament that
broadly backs a coalition government in which economic reformers
seem to have been given their head.
</P>
<P>
   Already, for instance, a bold law has been enacted to reduce
income tax to 13 percent across the board, in the hope of bringing
millions of tax-dodgers back into the revenue net.
</P>
<P>
   And Putin's approach to foreigners may also be reaping rewards:
stalled arms-cutting deals with America are again being struck.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, western leaders are giving a new Russian czar the
benefit of doubt. If those good things come with nasty addenda,
such as an upsurge of authoritarian intolerance at home and a
crescendo of snarls abroad, that _ so the Putin-boosters argue _ is
the price to be paid for reviving a humiliated and pauperized
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, it will be better for the world if the country
becomes prosperous and confident, however roughly that is achieved.
Only then, say those who see the merit of Putin a la Pinochet,
might Russia become something it has never been _ a law-based and
liberal society.
</P>
<P>
   But there is the rub. Can Russia become prosperous without first
entrenching a proper legal system to underpin a genuine free
market?
</P>
<P>
   Besides, it is still unclear how, or indeed whether, Putin
intends to fulfill his promise to bring to justice the influential
tycoons who have gobbled up so much of the state's wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, an independent judiciary, without the say-so of the
president, would simply set about prosecuting all cases of
corruption, starting with the most blatant.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, even if Putin were sincere in his wish to clean
up, he would probably not at this early stage in his presidency
have the power to do so _ without recourse to strong-arm methods
that are themselves illegal.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest of Gusinsky, no angel despite his courage as chief
upholder of a free press, reeks of despotism. But if, for instance,
the Putin-prompted prosecutors were instead to take on Boris
Berezovsky, widely seen as the most malign and powerful of the
plutocrats, the action might reasonably be regarded as just as
politically inspired.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the taming of the oligarchs appears to be all about
power play and very little about justice.
</P>
<P>
   It is early days. In the three months since the election, Putin
has moved cautiously, apart from the rash attack on Gusinsky, which
may turn out to have been his first big mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever his critics' suspicions, and his defenders' hopes, it
is still unclear whether the new president is an autocrat or a
democrat, his own man or the servant of others.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, it is unclear whether he is keen to collude with
the tycoons, several of whom helped him to power, or to cut them
down. At present, his emerging team is a rum mix of economic
reformers, former KGB people and tycoons. In any event, outsiders
probably have little influence at present.
</P>
<P>
   If it becomes clear that Putin's desire to bring strong
government to his people means trashing their rights, then Russia's
expulsion from the Council of Europe is inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   He should certainly not be allowed to believe that the West
would merely wink at greater authoritarianism. On the other hand, a
concerted effort to encourage the judiciary to uphold the rule of
law impartially should be warmly welcomed.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, no government money from the West should go to
Putin's Russia. A better home for western cash can be found among
the more hopeful countries on Russia's rim.
</P>
<P>
   Things may change, but, for the time being at least, Putin
remains on probation. &QL;

<P>
   Health-care spending is everywhere on the increase. In 1948, it
took 3 percent of gross world product; now, says a new report from
the World Health Organization, the figure is 7.9 percent and
rising.
</P>
<P>
   That is reasonable: as people and countries get richer and
older, they naturally want to spend more of their incomes on
health, as on other services.
</P>
<P>
   But health is not as simple as, say, hairdressing: how the
system is organized and paid for critically affects what you get
for your money. That makes international comparisons of health care
extremely useful.
</P>
<P>
   The WHO report, which tries for the first time to rank
countries' performance, is thus welcome. Governments and
health-care providers have much to learn from studying the
structure and performance of other countries' health systems.
</P>
<P>
   But what may matter more for public policy than the rankings in
the WHO report are four more general conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   The first is the lack of any clear connection between inputs
(more spending, say) and desired outputs (better health). There is
only a tenuous link between health-care spending and broader
measures of health: if the latter are the goal, spending more on
things like housing or education often does more to reach it.
</P>
<P>
   But even on health-care systems' own ground, the WHO cites
evidence of hugely wasteful spending. Those governments that appear
to think that more money is all that is needed to improve
health-care performance should think again: structural and
management reforms to raise efficiency can count for a lot more
than cash.
</P>
<P>
   The low ranking of America in the WHO tables supports this view
_ for America spends far more on health than any other country. Yet
the main reason for dissatisfaction with America's performance is
not its extravagance: it is the numbers of uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   For Americans with health insurance, as the WHO report says, the
system is highly responsive and impressive. But the poor health
care dished out to the 44 million-odd Americans who lack any
regular health-insurance coverage drags down the country's ranking.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the second conclusion: if the American system (and that of
other countries with similar gaps) is to improve, some way must be
found to spread insurance coverage, whether publicly or privately
financed, across the whole population.
</P>
<P>
   A third conclusion is that health-care delivery, as opposed to
finance, is showing some encouraging signs of convergence.
</P>
<P>
   From the purchaser/provider split in Britain's National Health
Service to America's health-maintenance organizations, countries
are moving in the direction of a form of ``managed care,'' in which
doctors, hospitals and other providers operate within certain
budget constraints, and there is some effort to foster both
consumer choice and producer competition.
</P>
<P>
   This attempt to yoke a form of market forces into the
health-care business is well worth pursuing, even if professionals
and their trade unions squeal about it.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth conclusion is that the boundaries between public and
private health care should be eroded. As the WHO report complains,
health ministries tend to look solely at public health-care
systems, ignoring the role that private provision and finance can
play.
</P>
<P>
   In most countries, public finance, whether from taxes or from
social insurance, is likely to predominate in health care; but it
need not obstruct private insurance or some out-of-pocket spending,
which can be useful safety valves, especially for people in rich
countries who wish to spend more than their governments would like.
</P>
<P>
   Nor should there be a rigid demarcation between public and
private providers: distinctions are better drawn over
responsiveness and efficiency than over ownership. For most of us,
after all, health care is far too important to be left to the
state. &QL;

   SAN FRANCISCO _ Strange bedfellows are part of the California
scene. Even so, the sight of car companies, oil firms and
environmentalists snuggling up together seems a bit odd; even odder
is the idea of them coming out in favor of an idea normally
associated with right-wing economists.
</P>
<P>
   On June 22, the California Environmental Dialogue, a new
32-member group including General Motors, Chevron, BP Amoco, the
Sierra Club and Environmental Defense, published a paper on the
state's transport policy.
</P>
<P>
   Much of what the CED proposes in its paper is pretty tame stuff
_ patching up rickety bridges before they become unsafe, buses for
the young, old and infirm, more bike paths.
</P>
<P>
   But endorsing the principle that the ``user should pay'' for
road use and that ``tolls and congestion pricing should be utilized
whenever possible'' is a first for the big oil and car firms.
</P>
<P>
   It is not hard to imagine the CED coalition coming apart over
more of the details. But its existence is a good indication of the
growing controversy over Californian sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   After little investment in infrastructure for 25 years, the
state's transport system is groaning.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses complain about potential employees turning down job
offers that would compel them to spend hours a day commuting. Car
makers worry that unless air quality improves they will be ordered
to meet yet stricter design standards.
</P>
<P>
   Road-pricing has long been championed by economists, keen to
impose more of the external costs of driving on road-users by
charging them a fee that reflects not just the distance travelled
(which is loosely what gasoline taxes do) but also the time and
route of the journey.
</P>
<P>
   Driving imposes a heavier burden of externalities when it is
done at rush hour (it adds to delays and is less energy-efficient)
so such journeys ought to cost a driver more. In theory, drivers
will then adjust their departure times and smooth out the flow of
traffic through the day.
</P>
<P>
   Car makers have been understandably nervous about any system
that charges their customers. But motorists are a tolerant lot. Car
ownership and use has continued to rise even as road-building
levelled off in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Greens too are much more willing nowadays to accept ``market''
solutions to environmental problems: witness the growth in
emissions trading.
</P>
<P>
   The most nervous people are probably politicians. Voters seem to
tolerate tolls to finance the construction of roads _ the sort of
thing levied on some bridges and roads. But charging money
specifically to discourage driving is a harder sell.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers' groups, such as the American Automobile Association,
are firmly opposed to the idea. Kevin Murray, a state senator from
Los Angeles, argues that charging money for what are currently free
roads would be unfair on the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Road-pricing, he says, is a middle-class fantasy dreamed up by
``some dweeb in a dark room doing quantitative analysis.''
</P>
<P>
   The dweebs say their critics oversimplify things. Bob Poole, of
the libertarian Reason Foundation, points out that, rather than
just imposing new charges on currently free but crowded roads,
California could make use of its network of (largely unpopular and
underused) high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes on roads: these could
be opened to single drivers who choose to pay a toll.
</P>
<P>
   Southern California is home to two of America's four working
examples of high-occupancy toll lanes or HOTs (the other ones are
in Texas and Florida). One, SR-91 in Orange County, allows drivers
to pay an amount that depends on the time of day to jump into an
HOV lane.
</P>
<P>
   The other, on Interstate 15 north of San Diego, is closer to the
theoreticians' dream of adjusting price to demand: its fee varies
from 50 cents to $4, depending on the volume of traffic in the HOT
lane, with the current price flashed up on screens half a mile
before the lane starts. (An electronic transponder system means
that there is no need to stop at a toll booth.)
</P>
<P>
   HOT lanes have generally been well received once drivers
understand them. But the opportunities to install them are limited
to places with existing HOV lanes. And they will not change the
overall pattern of behavior in California.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the complaints, average commuting time remained
stable through the 1990s, but the average distance travelled grew.
People seem to like living further away from their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, their main response to any easing in congestion is to go
and live even further away. That psychology will take more than
road-pricing to change. &QL;

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ America's quadrennial search for a designated
mourner at the funerals of foreign dignitaries _ otherwise known as
the vice president _ is in full swing.
</P>
<P>
   Short-lists are being drawn up. Short-lists are being narrowed
down. Candidates are being grilled by selection teams. Candidates
are being grilled on television. Candidates are filling in endless
forms, hoping to avoid unexpectedly embarrassing their boss later
on.
</P>
<P>
   And all this is taking place against the traditional frenzied
speculation that is the inevitable consequence of not having much
else to discuss.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some current hopefuls, together with their main
drawbacks.
</P>
<P>
   On the Bush side: Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania? Too pro-choice.
(The Republican right might stampede.)
</P>
<P>
   John Danforth of Missouri? Too dignified. (He makes Bush look
shallow. Anyway, he's ruled himself out.)
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole? Uninspiring.
</P>
<P>
   John Kasich of Ohio? Looks like a boy scout.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Keating of Oklahoma? Said homicide is the best way to deal
with an unfriendly State teachers union.
</P>
<P>
   It is not much better for Gore: His front-runner is Evan Bayh.
Very telegenic. Very handsome. Very much an unknown from Indiana.
Very like Dan Quayle (though with more brains).
</P>
<P>
   How about Dianne Feinstein of California? Too married: her
husband has business dealings with China _ not ideal for a vice
president who shudders each time he hears ``Buddhist temple.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Rubin, then? Never been elected to anything in his life.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Richardson, the energy secretary? Just kidding. The last
batch of military secrets lost by his Los Alamos laboratories were
later found behind the photocopying machine. You couldn't invent
that kind of bad luck.
</P>
<P>
   A natural reaction is to say that none of it matters anyway. The
last time a vice president made a difference in an election was in
1960, when Lyndon Johnson helped deliver Texas to John Kennedy in a
close race.
</P>
<P>
   If George Bush senior could anoint Quayle vice president and
still get elected in 1988, then his son could appoint a plasticine
chicken in 2000 and not be harmed.
</P>
<P>
   The only person to whom the appointment seems to make any
difference is the appointee him- or herself.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1972, with the exception of Quayle, all vice presidential
candidates who have later sought their party's nomination for
president have got it. But so what? Except for President Bush, they
all lost the subsequent election.
</P>
<P>
   So is the veepstakes the creation of bored pundits with too much
time on their hands? Not entirely.
</P>
<P>
   This time, there is a slim chance the choice of running mate
could actually make a difference. It would not do so directly, as
LBJ did. Hardly anyone has the sort of favorite-son status that can
deliver big blocks of votes. But it could do so indirectly.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on whom he chooses, George W. Bush could alter the
dynamic of the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   So far the debate has focused on what a potential number two can
add to a ticket (with the general answer being, not much). But the
question can also be posed in a different way: will the choice
transform the way that the number one is seen?
</P>
<P>
   For Gore, it is hard to see how. He has a well-defined national
reputation anyway, which cannot be transformed at a stroke. And the
pool of Democratic heavyweights who could make a difference is
small.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley, for instance, whom he defeated in the primaries,
would not make much of an impact, even if he were persuadable.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not true of Bush. It is easy to forget when you look
at the Gore campaign, but Bush is the challenger.
</P>
<P>
   He has things to prove in the campaign, of which the most
important are that he has national stature, not just state-wide
popularity, and that he is more than just the choice of the
Republican establishment.
</P>
<P>
   He can make both points at once by picking as his running mate
someone of real substance from outside the charmed circle of the
Bush dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   Only two men fit the bill. The first is that perennial favorite,
Colin Powell, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who
has relentlessly refused attempts to lure him into politics.
</P>
<P>
   Were Bush to persuade Powell to join him, it would be a stunning
coup. The harsh fact remains, though, that there are no signs of
the general changing his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the lure of a man who could also transform peoples'
opinions of Bush and may be (slightly) more temptable: John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   The important point about McCain is not that he has a track
record of attracting independents, though that is obviously not to
be sneered at.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it that he (again like Powell) provides Bush with
credibility in foreign affairs. Nor is it even that McCain can
savage Gore on the embarrassing campaign-finance irregularities of
the 1996 election _ though that again is useful.
</P>
<P>
   No, the main value of choosing McCain is what it tells voters
about Bush. It suggests that Bush really can, as he claims, show
leadership, by persuading an independent politician, with a mind of
his own, to choose to run with him.
</P>
<P>
   It says he is a man of the center, not just because he makes a
lot of speeches about compassionate conservatism but because he has
picked someone whom conservatives loathe.
</P>
<P>
   Lastly, it implies he can work with people who do not agree with
him on everything and who do not kowtow to the Bush name-brand.
</P>
<P>
   This will be an essential attribute of governing in the next
administration, because one of the few near-certainties of 2001 is
that whichever party ends up with a majority in Congress will do so
by only the narrowest of margins.
</P>
<P>
   What better way to demonstrate your capacity to work with
opponents _ and distinguish yourself from Gore, who has a
reputation for divisiveness _ than to appoint a man who was, until
recently, trying to bash the living daylights out of you?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, McCain, still smarting from the bitter primary
campaign, says he does not want the job. That only increases the
prize. Bush's ability to persuade him to accept it would speak even
more loudly for his claim to be able to lead.
</P>
<P>
   Leadership, after all, does not consist of selectively rewarding
those who want to please you. Rather, it means persuading someone
to do something they do not want to do for the sake of the greater
good _ or in this case, for your own electability. &QL;

   BEIRUT _ When is a border less than a border? When it is blue.
So, at least, runs the contention of the United Nations officials
trying to confirm the Israeli army's retreat from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   When Israel first invaded Lebanon in 1978, the Security Council
called on it to pull back to Lebanon's ``internationally recognized
boundaries.'' But by the time Israel eventually got around to doing
so last month, no one could agree any more on where the boundary
lay.
</P>
<P>
   So the U.N., trying to fudge the issue, invented a new, blue
``withdrawal line'' where it thought the border should run. In
theory, this semantic sleight-of-hand allows it to certify Israel's
compliance with the resolution without getting involved in the
difficulties of defining the frontier.
</P>
<P>
   But the Lebanese government, which already has to cope with
green, red, black and purple lines left behind by the country's
civil war, is reluctant to add another shade to the spectrum. It
argues that the new boundary leaves several chunks of Lebanese
territory inside Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Although U.N. officials repeat the phrase ``without prejudice''
until their faces are as blue as their line, Lebanon is fearful
that it has next-to-no chance of securing a future readjustment. So
it insists that it will not allow U.N. peacekeepers to patrol the
border until the dispute is resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Kofi Annan, the U.N.'s secretary-general, says it will take a
few more days to make sure the Israelis are honoring the U.N.'s
line, but once that is in no doubt the peacekeepers must be
deployed.
</P>
<P>
   After some hesitation, the Security Council has sided with him,
putting its seal of approval on the pullout.
</P>
<P>
   In general, Lebanon has won little sympathy for its case. Its
ally, Syria, at first pressed it to make things difficult for the
Israelis in the hope of luring them to joint peace talks. But the
death of Hafez Assad, Syria's president for 30 years, has left
Lebanon with a distracted backer at best.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the area in question is laughably small: all of the
alleged incursions, bar one, cover no more than a few hundred
square meters.
</P>
<P>
   The exception, known as the Shibaa farms, has, in the words of a
local shepherd, grass to graze 10,000 goats. But it falls within
the slice of Syria occupied by Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. argues, not unreasonably, that any adjustments to the
Syrian-Lebanese border can wait until the land reverts to Syrian
hands.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, with the weight of world opinion against it, the
Lebanese government will probably bow to the inevitable and accept
the U.N.'s writ. In the meantime, the border remains a potential
flash point.
</P>
<P>
   The government has petulantly refused to send its soldiers south
to take control. The Hezbollah guerrillas, who led the battle to
eject the Israelis, remain on the prowl, and have threatened to
resume fighting unless Israel accepts Lebanon's interpretation of
the frontier.
</P>
<P>
   Without U.N. troops manning roadblocks, a disgruntled, or hired,
Lebanese or Palestinian would not find it hard to shoot a rocket or
two over the border into Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Such an incident, in turn, could provoke a return to the
conflict from which Lebanon and Israel have only just emerged. &QL;

<P>
   HARARE _ All he does is stuff envelopes for Zimbabwe's main
opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). But
since the MDC represents the first serious threat in 20 years to
President Robert Mugabe's party, ZANU-PF, Deligent Marowa's humdrum
job is hazardous.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, six thugs kidnapped him at gunpoint, handcuffed him,
beat him, drove bicycle spokes up his urethra and left him for
dead.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, he made it to a hospital. The same pistol-toting thugs
tried to abduct him from his sickbed, but fled when another patient
raised the alarm. Marowa can walk again, but he will never have
children.
</P>
<P>
   The ordeal was intended to frighten Marowa into abandoning the
MDC. It had the opposite effect. Brandishing his X-rays like a
banner of protest, he declares: ``We have to throw these criminals
out of power. And we will.''
</P>
<P>
   In a free and fair election, the ruling party would stand no
chance. Mugabe's government is violent, corrupt, incompetent and
detested. But ZANU enjoys the advantages of incumbency.
</P>
<P>
   The state-owned media applaud its unrealistic manifesto _ free
land, free houses, jobs for all, cheap food and gasoline, and so on
and so forth _ while ``uncovering'' MDC plots to bring back
colonialism and forced labor.
</P>
<P>
   ZANU receives public finance; opposition parties do not. A fifth
of the country's parliamentarians are appointed by the president.
Constituencies are gerrymandered, the electoral roll is out of
date, and a ZANU hack is in charge of the count.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, despite this head start, the ruling party could still lose
its majority (it currently controls 147 of the 150 seats).
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe himself does not have to run for re-election until 2002,
but a defeat for his party would weaken him considerably, and
perhaps even prompt ZANU to oust him.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid this, Mugabe is trying to terrorize the voters. He is
an old hand at this. When ZANU was a guerrilla movement, suspected
``sellouts'' had their ears and lips cut off.
</P>
<P>
   At independence in 1980, Mugabe would have won a free election,
but cheated anyway. His more violent followers prevented rivals
from campaigning in almost a third of the country, and murdered
several of them.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1980s, Mugabe's soldiers killed thousands of
dissidents in Matabeleland, and tortured many more.
</P>
<P>
   This year's campaign of intimidation has been less murderous,
but more systematic. Bands of ruffians, some of them veterans of
the liberation war, others merely pretending to be, have invaded
over 1,000 farms.
</P>
<P>
   The invaders say they are reclaiming land stolen from their
ancestors by white colonialists, but they make little effort to
cultivate it. Instead, they beat up farm workers, burn their shacks
and force them to attend ZANU rallies _ where they are whipped if
they chant the slogans with insufficient ardor.
</P>
<P>
   All this is organized and paid for by the security services,
reportedly commanded by the man behind the Matabeleland atrocities,
a cousin of Mugabe's.
</P>
<P>
   Various cruelties have been inflicted on teachers, nurses and
others who, because they can read and write, are assumed to be
opposition supporters. At least 30 people have been killed, and
many women gang-raped. Worse will follow, or so goes the warning,
if ZANU loses the election.
</P>
<P>
   Many ordinary Zimbabweans, however, refuse to be cowed. Despite
the perils, the MDC has put up candidates in every constituency.
Several of them, having been assaulted or threatened with death,
are in hiding. But still they campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In areas where it is too dangerous to stick up MDC posters by
day, they do it stealthily by night, or drop leaflets from light
aircraft. &QL;

<P>
   Although the state media refuse to air their message, the
independent press continues to maul Mugabe, and nongovernmental
organizations spread the word that the ballot will be secret.
</P>
<P>
   Many farm workers, despite their welts and bruises, remain
quietly defiant. On a road between tobacco fields in rural Macheke,
the scene of several farm invasions, a freshly-beaten worker
muttered: ``The so-called veterans can't just carry us where they
want, as if we were bags.'' Another said: ``If it is time to die,
we can die.'' &QL;

<P>
   The atmosphere at ZANU rallies is joyless. Despite generous
handouts of beer and T-shirts to those who show up, few do. Rows of
shiny portapotties stay fresh and unused. Sparse crowds clap
listlessly.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, MDC rallies throb with enthusiasm. Throngs of
people wave red cards to signal, in a footballing analogy, that it
is time Mugabe was sent off.
</P>
<P>
   Speakers at ZANU rallies, especially Mugabe himself, blather on
about the party's heroic deeds during the liberation struggle, but
gloss over the two decades in which ZANU has been in charge of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Some bigwigs are so out of touch that they are genuinely baffled
by their unpopularity. Vice President Simon Muzenda has told
disgruntled party members that they should vote for the candidates
ZANU chooses, even if ZANU were to choose a baboon.
</P>
<P>
   Who will win? It is impossible to predict. Pessimists fear that
pluck and popularity will not be enough to defeat a cunning old
despot who is determined to use all the machinery of the state to
preserve his power.
</P>
<P>
   Optimists counter that Mugabe cheated during a referendum in
February, and still lost. This showed Zimbabweans that change was
possible, giving heart to the opposition. But it also jolted ZANU
out of its complacency.
</P>
<P>
   The party is cheating much more energetically now than before
the referendum. A recent opinion poll suggested that the MDC would
win 70 seats. This would give it a majority of the seats contested
but not, because of the 30 MPs Mugabe can appoint, a majority in
parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Conducted in an atmosphere of intimidation, the poll probably
underestimated opposition support.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the election result will depend on the answers to
two questions. First, will the presence of the international
observers, invited by Mugabe to maintain the illusion of fairness,
prevent excessive ballot-stuffing? They will be fairly sparse on
the ground; a large number of other would-be monitors have been
banned.
</P>
<P>
   Second, has Mugabe's thuggery so frightened people that they
will be afraid to vote his party out of office? Or has it so
enraged them that they will risk its retribution? &QL;

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ ``The big American gas crunch is coming,'' says Mark
Papa, the boss of EOG, an American energy company.
</P>
<P>
   Angry American drivers, paying record prices for gasoline, may
think the crunch has come already. But the gas market suffering
this particular price shock is largely unaffected by gyrations in
oil price.
</P>
<P>
   Although few outside the industry have noticed, prices for
natural gas in the United States have shot up in the past year. The
rise has surprised even old industry hands.
</P>
<P>
   Until the mid-1990s, there was so much gas available that supply
consistently outpaced demand. Prices were soft and margins weak. No
longer. Supply is, at long last, becoming tighter.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all the gas consumed in America comes from domestic
sources or from neighboring Canada. Many of these fields are now
past their prime.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Denhardt of WEFA, an industry consultancy, reckons that the
rate at which output from America's offshore gas fields is
declining has risen in recent years, from below 20 percent a year
to well above 40 percent. That also means that firms investing in
new wells are extracting declining amounts of gas.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, demand is soaring. As America's decaying power grid
groans under the annual strain of heat waves, such as a recent one
in California that led to blackouts in Silicon Valley, demand for
power is growing.
</P>
<P>
   Dramatic recent advances in gas-turbine technology, which have
made gas plants much less expensive than rival options, mean that
almost all new plants use gas. GE, the leading manufacturer of gas
turbines, has an order backlog several years long.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, gas now has cachet as a green fuel. Burning gas
produces fewer greenhouse gases than do other fossil fuels,
especially coal (coal-fired generation still makes up over half of
America's installed power base).
</P>
<P>
   The Environmental Protection Agency's recent attacks on old coal
plants in the Midwest have spurred the dash to gas. Natural-gas
prices are also likely to remain high because of the decline in
stored gas.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, firms store a certain amount of gas to sell during
the cold months of winter, when demand for heating is strong. This
year, however, the amount of gas in storage has plunged, and
industry analysts say that shortfall will increase.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is that firms, tempted by the current high prices,
are selling gas that they might otherwise have stored. Another,
says Denhardt, is that the growth of supply from decaying fields
has not kept pace with demand, so that there is simply less surplus
gas to store.
</P>
<P>
   In most commodity markets, soaring prices eventually bring an
adjustment of supply or demand. However, gas is unlike most
commodities, for it is difficult to handle and costly to store and
transport.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike oil, which can be transported in anything from gallon
jugs to gigantic tankers, gas usually requires extensive, expensive
pipelines to be in place from the wellhead all the way through to
customers' homes.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, one response that high prices produce in other
commodity markets _ a diversion of supplies from places where
prices are lower _ cannot happen easily.
</P>
<P>
   The exception is gas that is compressed into liquid form (LNG);
but this is so costly that it accounts for less than 1 percent of
America's gas.
</P>
<P>
   That may change. William McCormick, head of CMS Energy, which
runs America's biggest LNG terminal, says that prices for gas have
to be over $3 per million British thermal units (mBtu) for LNG
imports to make economic sense.
</P>
<P>
   He is so confident that gas prices will remain above that level
that he plans to increase his firm's terminal size by a third. He
reckons that LNG imports could, in time, make up 4-5 percent of
America's total supply.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot of all this is that even higher prices may be on the
way. Some worry that prices may rise to the once unthinkable level
of $6 per mBtu.
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, worries Paul Portney of Resources for the
Future, a respected think-tank, ``the federal government might then
step in, as it did in the 1970s, to regulate who can use gas
(homeowners and utilities, say) and who can't (industrial
customers, maybe).''
</P>
<P>
   An alternative possibility, described by Papa, is that the sheer
scarcity of gas could force demand down. Or worse, force it out: he
points to the recent flight to gas-rich Trinidad of a firm that
makes ammonia, an energy-intensive process, and insists that ``the
chemicals industry is next.''
</P>
<P>
   Papa's firm and others are lobbying the government for
permission to drill on federal land and on offshore sites that are
off limits. They would also love tax credits for exploration. But
for the moment, America's politicians seem too preoccupied with the
other ``gas'' crisis to heed such calls.
</P>
<P>
   Natural gas will be a seller's market for some time to come. &QL;

   AMATA CITY AND SAMRONG _ They are cheap, educated, friendly and
fastidious, and Ralph-Rainer Ohlsen loves them.
</P>
<P>
   He smiles benignly at the women and men assembling BMW 318s and
328s in the light-flooded, squeaky-clean factory in Thailand's
Rayong province that he opened last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those Thais even take their shoes off when they get in the
cars,'' he enthuses. ``It's great.'' That sort of thing never
happens at BMW's South African factory, which he previously ran;
nor, for that matter, at its Dingolfing plant in Bavaria.
</P>
<P>
   After Ford last year and GM in April, BMW is the latest western
carmaker to set up in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   This might seem odd in a country where car sales plummeted by 70
percent during the Asian crisis and production is still well below
pre-crisis levels.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a new study of the car market in the Association of
South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) by the Economist Intelligence
Unit, a sister company of The Economist, suggests that car sales in
the region will return to pre-crisis levels only after 2005.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans and Europeans come to Thailand with a vision that
differs from that of the Japanese companies which dominate the
region. Whereas the Japanese treat each ASEAN country as a distinct
market, the Americans and Europeans are planning for a day when
trade is free across the region.
</P>
<P>
   According to Jochen Legewie, a car expert at the German
Institute for Japanese Studies in Tokyo, this ``power shift'' away
from the Japanese, who today make nine out of ten cars and trucks
sold in ASEAN, towards western producers will prove the biggest
force for change in the economics and politics of car-making in
Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The goal for westerners is global economies of scale. If they
reach it, the Japanese will lose out.
</P>
<P>
   Visit, for instance, the factory of Toyota in Samrong, an hour
north of Bangkok, and you see trucks unloading Thai parts from Thai
suppliers for assembly lines that make cars for Thai consumers.
</P>
<P>
   At Toyota's plants in the Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia,
it is the same story. Everywhere in the region, Toyota and other
Japanese carmakers have, in effect, recreated a whole supply chain
in order to serve the local market.
</P>
<P>
   This is inefficient, and Toyota, for one, is losing money in the
region. But the Japanese have had little choice, because politics
has dictated their Asian strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ASEAN countries used to subscribe to import substitution as a
development philosophy, and to burden foreign investors with
onerous local-content requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Some also have their own ``national'' car projects, such as
Malaysia's Proton, and are hostile to foreign competition. Tariffs
on cars and car parts, high to begin with, went higher still during
the crisis of the late 1990s, as countries tried in vain to
conserve hard currency.
</P>
<P>
   Having watched American trade unionists bash Japanese cars in
Detroit in the 1980s, says Yoshiaki Muramatsu, president of Toyota
in Thailand, the Japanese decided to follow a strategy of
``harmonious growth'' in the region, in effect sacrificing bigger
economies of scale to national politics.
</P>
<P>
   But hopes of liberalizing trade in ASEAN have revived. Since
1996, companies in ASEAN have been able to apply for a reduction in
tariffs on parts traded within the region. But the bureaucracies
empowered to grant the reductions have tended to block any
applications.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest hope now is for an Asian Free-Trade Area (AFTA) to
take effect in January 2002. If it goes ahead, tariffs on cars and
parts will be limited to a ceiling of 5 percent, low enough to
allow the development of a genuine pan-regional marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   It is this prospect that so excites the western companies. GM,
for instance, plans to export up to 90 percent of the Zafira vans
that it makes at its Thai factory to the rest of the region, and
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Ford now makes several models with sub-optimal efficiency, but
it has designed its plant to convert to making one model highly
efficiently for export around the region.
</P>
<P>
   As for BMW, it sees three phases for its plant. In the first, it
makes cars for Thailand, in the second it expands production and
starts exporting, and in the third it sources from, and exports to,
anywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it all depends on AFTA going ahead, says Ohlsen. ``If
phases two and three happen, it's a hat-trick,'' he says. ``I'm
convinced it won't go pear-shaped.''
</P>
<P>
   Because so much rides on trade liberalization, westerners are
lobbying hard for it. Kitcha Minakan, a director at Thailand's
Ministry of Industry, says ``the Japanese come and ask what our
laws are and then try to please us. The Europeans look at our laws,
say they cannot abide by them entirely, but then try as much as
possible. But the Americans come in and say, ``This is all wrong,
you have to change everything.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Minakan and Thailand will not be the biggest obstacles
to AFTA, because Thailand, as the production base of choice for the
westerners, has the most to gain from liberalization.
</P>
<P>
   The main foot-dragger will be Malaysia, which fears for its
Proton. But the westerners are undaunted. They look forward to
being able to put their factories wherever the combination of
labor, suppliers and transport works best, and to export from them
to the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a critical point. Their way is different from ours,''
says Toyota's Muramatsu. ``We must study how we, too, can enjoy
further liberalization.'' That is as close as a Japanese executive
ever comes to saying, ``We are worried.'' &QL;

FOUR AIRLINES FORM AN INTERNATIONAL ALLIANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   By KRUTI TRIVEDI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Delta Air Lines, Air France, Aeromexico and Korean Air announced
an alliance on Thursday that will stretch across three continents
and attempt to compete with pacts already formed by rivals.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines will share perks, pool frequent flyer miles
programs and coordinate schedules in the alliance, called
``Skyteam.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts who follow Delta, the No. 3 U.S. airline, said
its participation is primarily a marketing strategy aimed at
helping Delta catch up to its larger domestic rivals, United
Airlines and American Airlines, which have established global
partners. The alliance should also help Air France compete with
Germany's Lufthansa, a United partner, and British Airways, an
American partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a defensive position,'' said Kevin Murphy, an analyst at
Morgan Stanley. ``They're banding together to preserve market
share.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the strongest group of carriers is the Star Alliance,
which includes United, Lufthansa and Singapore Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   For passengers, the advantage of flying an airline that
participates in an alliance is the convenience. Passengers need to
book only one ticket and check in baggage once, regardless how
manytimes they change carriers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognize that Star Alliance is the best-functioning
alliance today,'' Leo F. Mullin, Delta's chief executive officer
told reporters in New York. ``We believe that we are going to start
close to second place day one.''
</P>
<P>
   Other airline alliances said they saw little significant threat.
Chris Chiames, a spokesman for American, said ``we're pleased to
finally welcome this grouping of airlines to the world of
alliances.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the Star Alliance, Skyteam will offer frequent flyer perks
like priority check-in and luxury lounges. Passengers with more
than 100,000 miles will be guaranteed an economy class seat.
</P>
<P>
   Although Skyteam is entering the game at a later stage than its
major competitors, analysts said it should be able to compete
effectively with United's Star Alliance, American's One World, and
Continental's Wings Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``They start out behind the other three major alliances which
have been in operation for a while,'' said Philip Baggaley, a
managing director at the Standard and Poor's Corp. ``However, both
Delta and Air France are strong across the Atlantic. At least it
has gotten Delta and Air France more firmly into the alliance
game.''
</P>
<P>
   But Skyteam could face problems in Asia, where it does not have
a strong hub. Neither Delta nor Air France has booked passengers on
Korean Air since April 1999, when safety issues led both airlines
to suspend dealing with the Asian carrier. &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Company executives in search of wisdom are turning
from psychotherapy and religion to the cleverest thinkers of all:
ancient philosophers.
</P>
<P>
   For corporations, philosophy has become the latest management
fad.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Morris, author of ``If Aristotle Ran General Motors: The New
Soul of Business,'' earns $30,000 an hour _ one of the highest fees
for a non-celebrity speaker in America _ for teaching Socrates and
Hegel to the likes of IBM, Campbell Soup, General Electric and
Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Lou Marinoff, who wrote a popular book published last autumn,
called ``Plato, not Prozac! Applying Philosophy to Everyday
Problems,'' is spearheading the rise of ``philosophy counselling,''
which has roots in Europe in the early 1980s but is new to America.
</P>
<P>
   Marinoff has founded the grand-sounding American Philosophical
Practitioners Association, which has trained around 70 philosophy
counsellors so far and has backing from a local assemblyman to
certify the practice in New York State.
</P>
<P>
   Marinoff, who charges $100 an hour (in line with
clinical-psychology rates), says many of his clients are
``refugees'' from psychology and psychiatry. ``Philosophy deals
with big questions _ purpose, ethics, moral quandaries _ without
messing up their emotions.''
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, Alain de Botton's best-seller, ``How Proust Can
Change Your Life,'' has spawned an agony column in a Sunday
newspaper. His latest book, ``The Consolations of Philosophy,''
pops philosophers like pills: take Socrates for unpopularity,
Epicurus for lack of money, Seneca for frustration and Montaigne
for inadequacy.
</P>
<P>
   De Botton, being a cerebral sort of chap (and much consoled by
making a successful television series on his book), has not yet
moved seriously into the business of management counselling. When
he does, he will find that there is now a brand-new market for the
sages: failed Internet entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher McCullough, a self-styled ``clinical philosopher''
based in San Francisco, says that half his practice consists of
``manic start-up types who can smell the money, but see it
disappearing fast.''
</P>
<P>
   McCullough, who runs a philosophy cafe in a local Barnes &AMP; Noble
bookshop and is soon opening his own cafe, prescribes the example
of Epictetus, a noted Stoic philosopher, to teach people how to
stay serene when they have lost everything.
</P>
<P>
   Epictetus is just the thing for those with underwater stock
options. He led a life of exemplary contentment, simplicity and
virtue, living in a small hut furnished with only a bed and a lamp.
</P>
<P>
   McCullough's success in prescribing him suggests that
high-achieving entrepreneurs prefer intellectual discussion to
treatment for depression or anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is much less tissue and couch use in philosophy
counselling,'' says McCullough. ``And I have more room to be
funny.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Socrates, he must be guffawing in his tomb. &QL;

BEER MAGNATE JIM HENSLEY DIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jim Hensley, head of one of the nation's largest beer
distributorships and father-in-law of U.S. Sen. John McCain, died
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Hensley, 80, was founder and chairman of Hensley &AMP; Co.,
Anheuser-Busch's largest franchise. Based in west Phoenix, the
business employs more than 500 people and does about $220 million
in annual sales.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Delgado, company president, praised Hensley's high standards
and sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   Hensley and his brother, Eugene, founded United Liquor Co. in
Phoenix before World War II. After a stint in the Army Air Corps,
Hensley founded his namesake company in 1955.
</P>
<P>
   The soft-spoken Hensley, a resident of Phoenix, shunned the
spotlight but was well known to generations of Arizona politicians
and innumerable charities. Through the Hensley Family Foundation,
he gave to many charities and supported groups ranging from NASCAR
to Gilbert Rodeo Days.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1982, the company has contributed $80,000 to McCain's
campaigns. McCain's wife, Cindy, is a vice president of the company
but is not involved in daily operations.
</P>
<P>
   Funeral arrangements for Hensley, who died after a long illness,
are pending. &QL;

 FOSSIL FIND REVIVES DEBATE OVER BIRD EVOLUTION  &HT;     By DAVID PERLMAN 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The fossil of a controversial birdlike reptile that existed some
220 million years ago has convinced a team of scientists that the
creature had feathers, glided from trees and may have led to the
evolution of modern birds.
</P>
<P>
   The concept has revived a fierce debate among researchers who
hold that the fossil had scales, not feathers, and that it was the
dinosaurs of antiquity that were the true ancestors of the entire
bird family.
</P>
<P>
   Fossil hunters from the Universities of North Carolina and
Oregon, as well as other research centers in the United States and
Russia, report their findings Friday in the journal Science. They
claim that an examination of the fossil of a small reptilian
creature discovered in Central Asia more than 20 years ago carries
 &LR; reveals the imprint of the oldest feathers ever found, with hollow
shafts on both sides of its body almost identical to the shafts on
modern birds' feathers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any question any longer that this thing
was ancestral to flying birds,'' said Alan Feduccia of the
University of North Carolina. ``We know that the feathers evolved
from the scales of reptiles, and while this creature that we
studied could not have been able to fly, it most probably was a
glider.''
</P>
<P>
   The environment of that ancient period, known as the Triassic,
must have supported vast forests dominating the landscape, Feduccia
and his colleagues argue. It would be logical to theorize, they
say, that winged creatures living in those trees would learn to
glide from tree to tree _ much as some large modern reptiles with
outspread scaly webs between their feet do.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are some amazing fossils, and at the very least, they
prove that feathers did not evolve in dinosaurs,'' said John Ruben,
a paleontologist at Oregon State University. ``The supposed link
between dinosaurs and birds is pretty entrenched in paleontology,
but it's not as solid as the public has been led to believe.''
</P>
<P>
   The fossil reptile has been named Longisquama insignis, and its
supporters argue that its feathers _ and thus true flight _ must
have evolved long before any small swift-running dinosaurs could
have developed feathers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here you've got an animal that isn't a bird, and it isn't a
dinosaur, and yet it has feathers,'' said Nicholas R. Geist, a
fossil researcher at Sonoma State University and co-author of the
Science report.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is going to be a major monkey wrench in the theory about
the dinosaurean origin of birds,'' he said. ``It is going to cause
some people to take a real good second look at their data.''
</P>
<P>
   But other scientists are not impressed by the evidence. They
maintain that the condition of the Longisquama fossil is too poor,
and the remains too fragmentary, to constitute convincing proof.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Padian, a noted paleontologist at the University of
California in Berkeley, scoffed at the idea that the fossil reptile
was a feathered creature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those imprints look as much like feathers as a duck-billed
platypus looks like the beak of a duck,'' he said. ``And there's
absolutely no evidence that the creature's feather-like scales
could be used in flight.''
</P>
<P>
   Luis Chiappe of the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles and
another noted dinosaur fossil researcher who saw the report, agreed
with Padian.
</P>
<P>
   ``The interpretation that these scales are feathers is extremely
unconvincing,'' Chiappe said. ``They may look like the feathered
leaves of a fern, but they certainly do not look like true feathers
at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be a fantastic creature with weird long scales on its
body, but I am not convinced it is feathered. And there certainly
is strong evidence from many dinosaur fossils that there were
indeed feathered dinosaurs.''
</P>
<P>
   The first dinosaur fossils were discovered in Europe more than
100 years ago, and now they have been found on virtually every
continent. A century ago, scientists argued about the fossils, and
for the past 10 years, the argument over dinosaurs and birds has
been shrill and persistent.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of paleontologists, however, now argue that
feathered dinosaurs racing across the land at least 150 million
years ago were the creatures that first evolved the ability for
true flight, the animal ancestors of modern birds.
</P>
<P>
   To scientists like Padian and Chiappe, today's birds are in fact
modern dinosaurs _ most probably descendants of animals like the
meat-eating, flying dinosaur called Archaeopteryx that lived 150
million years ago and whose fossil remains have been known of for
nearly 150 years.

<P>
   President Clinton, whose Phoenix fund-raising visit was
sponsored in part by a Republican, returned the bipartisan favor
Thursday by hailing cross-party cooperation to improve Arizona
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thrilled when I found out that your Republican governor
and . . . all the Democratic legislators were pushing an education
initiative to lower class size, raise teacher pay and improve the
quality of education,'' he told a $5,000-a-plate luncheon audience
of 70 at the Ritz-Carlton hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The luncheon was hosted by sports mogul Jerry Colangelo, a GOP
stalwart.
</P>
<P>
   Scottsdale Democrat Fred DuVal, who introduced Clinton, said
Colangelo's gesture ``proves that he places civic leadership above
partisanship.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with a $500-a-person reception attended by more than 300,
Clinton's visit raised $570,000 for the Democratic National
Committee, a state party record, DuVal said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Clinton's remarks rallied support for Al Gore, whom he
called ``by far the most significant vice president in the history
of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Before departing for San Diego, Clinton spent more than an hour
touring the Heard Museum's collection of Native American art and
artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   Casual visitors were surprised to encounter the president in the
galleries.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton asked a family of four from Baltimore, ``Having fun?''
and quickly added, ``It's a great city.'' &QL;

MINOR BASEBALL TEAM EYES WEST COAST COUNTY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID GREENBERG 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VENTURA, Calif. _ A group that includes the son of former Los
Angeles Dodgers owner Peter O'Malley has unveiled plans to bring a
minor-league baseball team to Ventura County and build an early
20th century-style ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Top of the Third Inc. purchased the Stockton Ports in May 1998
and renamed them the Mudville Nine in hopes of building a $15
million to $20 million stadium for its planned move within a couple
years. Supporters did not reveal plans for any public financing
they might seek or say specifically where the ballpark complex
might be located.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ventura County is a great market for a minor-league baseball
team,'' Tom Seidler, president of the team, a Single-A affiliate of
the Milwaukee Brewers, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a vibrant community with a healthy economy. There are a
lot of families here, and there is no professional or major college
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the most part, it's wholesome family entertainment at
affordable prices at a time when major league (tickets) are getting
more expensive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mudville Nine is a part of the California League, an
advanced Single-A professional league. Ballplayers who advance to
this level generally have two to four years of professional
experience, and a typical team features a couple of future major
leaguers on its roster.
</P>
<P>
   Current Dodger Gary Sheffield and Oakland Athletic John Jaha, as
well as former California Angel Don Baylor are among the alumni of
the team that won nine championships in the past 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Lancaster JetHawks, the Seattle Mariners' Single-A
franchise, have sent a half-dozen prospects to the big leagues
since arriving in the Antelope Valley in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura County previously played host to the Pacific Suns, an
independent league team that played one season in Oxnard. Burdened
with high payroll costs and spotty attendance, the team went
bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   But Mudville Nine officials -- including Kevin O'Malley, the
team's vice president and general manager -- say they expect no
such problems if the franchise moves to Ventura County. They
envision building a two-deck, 4,000- to 5,000-seat ballpark --
possibly surrounded by themed early 20th-century retail shops,
restaurants and offices.
</P>
<P>
   Franchise officials originally planned to build the early
20th-century stadium in Stockton, replacing the 2,800-seat Billy
Hebert Field. Built in 1927, it is now the oldest minor-league
field west of the Mississippi River.
</P>
<P>
   But two years of government red tape and poor fan support forced
management to look elsewhere, posing the possibility that the
51-year-old California League would lose one of its original host
cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody doubts that Billy Hebert Field is not a long-term
viable field for professional baseball,'' Seidler said. ``It has
all the problems that a 73-year-old stadium would have. We are
exclusively looking at Ventura County.''
</P>
<P>
   The move first must be approved by the 10-team California
League, however, and its president, Joe Gagliardi, said Thursday's
announcement was premature.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, they haven't moved, and this league hasn't
authorized them to move,'' he said. ``They aren't going anyplace
right now, because there they don't have a site down there. That's
all that they're doing ... investigating.''
</P>
<P>
   But Seidler said he believes the California League wants a team
in Ventura County and that the mve will be approved once a site
for the stadium is secured.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of a story waiting for a home. We're trying to bring
`Casey at Bat' to Ventura County,'' said Seidler, referring to the
legendary poem the Stockton team was named after.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got everything the other minor-league ballparks have. And
then, above and beyond, it appeals to the imagination and offers a
more immersing experience. There's definitely some romance and
nostalgia that appeals to people.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will probably capture that,'' he said. ``It will be the
kind of place that people will want to visit.''

 ASSEMBLY SENDS $94 BILLION BUDGET TO GOV. DAVIS  &HT;     By GREG LUCAS and LYNDA GLEDHILL 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ Assembly Republicans cast the votes needed Thursday
to send a $95 billion budget to Gov. Gray Davis after Democrats
embraced a big cut in the license fees Californians pay on their
cars.
</P>
<P>
   The reduction in the fees _ vehicle owners will pay about 30
percent less next year _ broke a weeklong stalemate in the Assembly
over how large a tax cut the budget should include.
</P>
<P>
   ``The investments we make in this budget are critical. I think
they're the ones our voters asked us for,'' said Assemblywoman
Denise Ducheny, D-San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   The massive plan, beefed up by a cash surplus of $12.3 billion,
dictates state spending for the fiscal year beginning July 1. It
now goes to Davis, who has the power to cross out individual
spending items.
</P>
<P>
   As the Assembly began debating the budget Thursday, the
Democratic governor said he would veto the license fee cut that
cemented the deal unless lawmakers added $100 million in tax
credits benefiting high-tech companies.
</P>
<P>
   Davis also said the fee cut, which would drain nearly $3.6
billion from state coffers, also could accidentally trigger a $1.1
billion loss of sales tax money.
</P>
<P>
   ``If these defects are cured, I will sign the bill,'' Davis
said. ``If not, I will veto it.''
</P>
<P>
   He got at least part of what he wanted when the Assembly
approved the $100 million in tax cuts and pledged to eliminate the
threat of a sales tax loss. The Senate still must approve this cut.
</P>
<P>
   The overall spending plan, approved a week ago by the Senate,
won the same bipartisan support from the 80-member Assembly on a
vote of 61 to 17.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-six Democrats voted ``aye,'' as did 14 Republicans and one
independent.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans still weren't happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``These fiscal priorities represent a Democratic majority that
increases government spending by 20 percent,'' said Assemblyman
Tony Strickland, R-Moorpark.
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly's bipartisanship came only after a compromise was
reached on tax cuts. Davis said the license fee deal, which
provides hefty breaks to the millions of owners of cars, trucks,
motorcycles and trailers, was broader than the two tax breaks it
replaces _ a sales tax rebate and a modest drop in state income tax
rates.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, the owner of a $20,000 car would see his annual
license fee _ calculated at 2 percent of a vehicle's value _ halved
from $260 to $130 beginning next year.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, lawmakers echoed the spending priorities set by Davis
when he outlined his budget plan in January: education,
transportation and tax cuts. But other parts of state government
also benefit from California's record surplus.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some good stuff in there for mental health,
developmental disabilities, child care and seniors,'' said Senate
President John Burton, D-San Francisco, one of the architects of
the compromise budget.
</P>
<P>
   University of California funding rises 18.5 percent over last
year. Money for the California State University system climbs by 13
percent, and community college funding will increase more than 21
percent.
</P>
<P>
   There also is $575 million earmarked to make housing _ for
ownership and rental _ more affordable for lower-income
Californians.
</P>
<P>
   Another $140 million will expand local juvenile crime prevention
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Reimbursement rates for doctors and hospitals that provide care
for the poor under Medi-Cal will increase as an inducement to
provide more service.
</P>
<P>
   And $5.8 billion in bond money _ much of it from park and water
measures approved by voters in March _ will be spent on land
purchases, habitat restoration and various water projects.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest losers in the budget were cities and counties that
saw more than $2 billion in property tax revenue stripped away by
the state during the recession of the early 1990s to allow
lawmakers to balance the state's books.
</P>
<P>
   Although cities and counties saw some increases in money for
crime prevention and law enforcement this year, they only received
$200 million in new money to spend as they wish _ a fraction of the
surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at some of the big-ticket spending items.
</P>
<P>
   -- Public schools get $30.6 billion, including $1.8 billion of
discretionary spending, including pay increases for teachers or
other staff.
</P>
<P>
   Legislative budget writers estimate per-pupil spending will rise
by 11 percent over last year to $6,716 _ an additional $691 per
student.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers spent more than Davis suggested on child care, summer
school and after-school programs.
</P>
<P>
   -- The spending plan also includes incentives for people to
teach.
</P>
<P>
   There's a tax credit against 50 percent of the money teachers
earn from pay increases based on years of experience. A teacher
with four or five years experience would get a credit of $250. A
teacher with 20 or more years experience would receive $1,500.
</P>
<P>
   Current and new teachers also will receive an extra retirement
bonus. Teachers pay 8 percent of their salary into retirement. The
state will now contribute an additional 2 percent for each teacher.
</P>
<P>
   -- Despite misgivings over its workability, lawmakers largely
approved the governor's transportation plan.
</P>
<P>
   That plan, which some GOP and Democratic lawmakers oppose as a
glorified pork barrel reward, is a series of transit and highway
projects picked by Davis.
</P>
<P>
   He proposes spending $5.3 billion in seed money over the next
five years _ $2 billion in the coming budget year _ to begin
construction on the projects, although that construction won't
occur without another $10 billion in state and local revenue.
</P>
<P>
   The budget takes half of the sales tax paid on gasoline _
roughly $500 million _ and earmarks it for transportation projects
other than those picked by Davis.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk is split between state highways and local streets, with
some for projects of regional benefit.
</P>
<P>
   -- Davis got roughly $500 million more than the $2.7 billion in
tax cuts he sought, although the cuts bear no resemblance to what
he proposed.
</P>
<P>
   The governor wanted to give single taxpayers a $150 one-time
rebate, double for married couples. Lawmakers rejected that in
favor of a sales tax rebate, which they said would benefit more
Californians. But the sales tax rebate was axed Thursday in favor
of the license fee cut.
</P>
<P>
   For the past week, the Assembly wrangled over the effect of new
tax cuts in the budget on a scheduled 10 percent reduction in the
license fees in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said the new tax cuts should be counted against the
license fee increase. Republicans said they should not.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate ended the impasse by substituting the sales tax
rebate and a small cut in personal income tax rates sought by Davis
with a 32.5 percent cut in license fees beginning next year.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the state's vehicle owners are paying 35 percent less
in annual license fees than they were two years ago. In 1998,
lawmakers approved a five-year plan to lower license fees 67.5
percent by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's compromise accelerates that timetable. Next year,
vehicle owners will pay about two-thirds less than they did two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the rebate will come in a check, part will already be
calculated into the license fee bill sent by the Department of
Motor Vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the owner of a $20,000 car two years ago would pay
$400 in license fees or 2 percent of the car's value. Under the
cuts that have already been phased in, the fees have dropped to
$260. The new cut would drop the fee to $130, according to the
Department of Motor Vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Another tax break in the budget would increase the state's child
care credit up to $432 for state residents earning $10,000 or less
a year.
</P>
<P>
   For Californians earning between $30,000 and $100,000, the
credit ranges from $288 to $192, falling as income increases.
</P>
<P>
   There is also one-time aid for low-income seniors who are
renters and homeowners. The state will up the subsidy it pays for
rent and property taxes _ but only for one year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is as good as any budget and certainly no worse than
any,'' said Sen. Steve Peace, D-El Cajon, chair of the Senate
Budget Committee.

AMUSEMENT PARK PRICES HIT RECORD
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- A day at Magic Mountain costs a family of four an
average of $181.50, making it one of the nation's most expensive
amusement parks, according to a recent survey.
</P>
<P>
   But Six Flags California officials point out that discount
tickets make the actual cost much less for many park visitors.
</P>
<P>
   The survey of 25 U.S. theme parks, conducted by Amusement
Business magazine, calculated the cost for regular admission for
two adults and two children, parking, two hot dogs, two hamburgers,
four orders of fries, four soft drinks and two T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   The average price nationally for a family of four was $151.44, a
record high.
</P>
<P>
   Bakersfield resident Charles Rose, visiting Magic Mountain with
his three children, said he isn't bothered by the cost of going to
an amusement park.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get discount tickets, and it's a pretty good discount,''
Rose said. ``We're not going to overindulge them.''
</P>
<P>
   Many customers take advantage of discount ticket offers, said
Six Flags publicist Amy Means. The park offers discounts through
employers, restaurants, grocery stores and soft drink bottlers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our promotional offers do very well in the marketplace,''
Means said. The park does not release figures regarding the
percentage of admissions using discounts.
</P>
<P>
   The regular price of admission at Magic Mountain increased from
$36 to $40 in the past year, making it one of the more expensive
parks to enter.
</P>
<P>
   The costliest admission, however, belongs to Busch Gardens in
Tampa, Fla., and Universal Studios Florida in Orlando. Both parks
cost $46 for an adult admission.
</P>
<P>
   Universal Studios Hollywood is not one of the 25 parks included
in the survey. Its regular adult admission price is $41.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim's Disneyland, the other Southern California park in the
survey, charges an adult admission of $41.
</P>
<P>
   The least expensive admission was Nellie Bly Park in Brooklyn,
N.Y., which charges no admission, but gets $9.50 for a three-hour
ride pass.
</P>
<P>
   Universal Studios Florida also was the most expensive park
overall, with a cost of $227.50 for a family of four. Least costly
overall was Nellie Bly Park, with its free parking and $2 hot dogs.
The park also sells T-shirts for $4 and french fries for $1.
</P>
<P>
   Although Magic Mountain is slightly more expensive, it's well
within Monica Bodell's budget. With four children in tow, Bodell of
Manhattan Beach said she would spend $225.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm delightfully pleased that I spent less,'' she said. ``I
budgeted between $300 and $350.''

   DALLAS _ Lou Rosselli had already prevented Eric Akin from
achieving one Olympic dream. Akin had spent the past four years
making sure Rosselli wouldn't keep him from another.
</P>
<P>
   Rosselli, then the national champion, had defeated Akin in the
heartbreakingly close 114.5-pound final at the 1996 Olympic
wrestling trials. Akin returned the favor last night at Reunion
Arena by beating Rosselli in the 119-pound challenge tournament at
the 2000 U.S. Olympic freestyle trials to stay alive in the quest
for Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd have to say that Lou Rosselli still owns me. I've gotten
better because I've been training for him for the last four
years,'' said Akin, who was a four-time NCAA All-American for Iowa
State. ``He's the most dangerous athlete in my weight class.''
</P>
<P>
   After overtime in their semifinals match ended 1-1, Akin beat
Rosselli on a referee's decision. Akin, who finished second at
nationals this year to Sam Henson, advanced to the challenge
tournament finals against Stephen Abas. Rosselli drops to the
consolation bracket.
</P>
<P>
   The winner of each weight class in the challenge tournament will
face that weight class's respective national champion in the trials
finals tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Another runner-up from the 1996 trials, two-time world champion
Terry Brands, dominated his two bouts at 127.75 pounds. He beat
Army's Jeff Bedard, 10-0, for a technical fall in his first match
since he won the 1999 World Trials, then defeated Sunkist Kids'
Yero Washington, 8-0.
</P>
<P>
   Brands, the 1999 national champion, had retired because of
injury shortly before the 1999 World Championships. He petitioned
into the trials. He'll face Eric Guerrero in the challenge finals.
Guerrero beat Danny Felix, who defeated Guerrero at nationals, and
Tony Purler.
</P>
<P>
   Akin wasn't the only former Iowa State standout to produce
excitement yesterday. Former Cyclones wrestler Mike Van Arsdale
defeated ISU junior Cael Sanderson, 7-3, in the 187.25-pound
semifinals. Van Arsdale, 35, won the 1988 NCAA title, while
Sanderson, 21, is undefeated in college and already a two-time NCAA
champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's tough as hell,'' Van Arsdale said. ``I'm just older and
stronger than him. I opened up and let myself go. ''
</P>
<P>
   Van Arsdale will face 1997 NCAA champion Lee Fullhart in that
challenge final.
</P>
<P>
   California native Stephen Neal, the 1999 world champion in the
super-heavyweight class, will wrestle Tolly Thompson in that
division's challenge final. Neal, who had shoulder surgery after
last year's Worlds and lost at this year's U.S. Nationals to Kerry
McCoy, said he is again in winning shape. He defeated Airron
Richardson, 8-0, in the semifinals, while Thompson defeated Tom
Erickson, 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking for the tech and didn't get it. You win by eight
and that's good enough, I guess,'' Neal said. ``But I need to be
attacking more and not standing around. That's why I'm glad I have
this mini-tournament, to work on things.''
</P>
<P>
   With the depth of the U.S. freestyle ranks, wrestlers had to be
at their best even when facing lower seeds. Hawkeyes' Mike Mena,
seeded fourth, fell to 10th-seed Sheldon Thomas, 5-2, in the
quarterfinals. Thomas was a 1996 NCAA champion for Clarion (Pa.)
University.
</P>
<P>
   Mena said it would be difficult to put his heart into the
consolation rounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expected more of myself, more than anything. I just felt
slower than normal,'' Mena said. ``This really should be single
elimination. If you're out of the Olympic team, what are you still
wrestling for?''

<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Dikembe Mutombo a member of the Mavericks?
</P>
<P>
   That's what Mavericks owner Mark Cuban is hoping will happen.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban said he has contacted Atlanta about the possibility of
acquiring the Hawks' 7-foot-2 All-Star center for Shawn Bradley,
Robert Pack and John ``Hot Rod'' Williams. But Cuban doesn't know
whether the Hawks plan to unload Mutombo and build for the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been hitting Atlanta hard trying to push them \Rfor
Mutombo\S,'' Cuban said. ``They aren't sure if they are going to go
young, and for cap space, which would let them make the deal, or
build around Mutombo.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding Mutombo would solve most of the Mavericks' problems,
because he is the one inside defensive presence, rebounder and
intimidator the franchise has always lacked. Mutombo, who turns 34
on Sunday, is a six-time All-Star who won NBA Defensive Player of
the Year honors in 1995, '97 and '98. He is widely respected for
his shot-blocking skills, which will enable the Mavericks' guards
and forwards to take chances filling the defensive lanes.
</P>
<P>
   Mutombo, expected to earn $13 million next season, is in the
final year of his contract. Bradley, Pack and Williams are also in
the final year of their contracts.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks have a new coach in Lon Kruger Whether that means
trading Mutombo to the Mavericks, Cuban can only wait and see.
</P>
<P>
   ``As of now, they don't want to trade him,'' Cuban said. ``Other
deals are contingent on other teams getting deals done, so
nothing's close right now.'' \Nsubheds:Nuggets dispute report Kim
Hughes, the Denver Nuggets' player personnel director and assistant
coach, took exception to a published report that the Mavericks have
offered guard Robert Pack, forward John ``Hot Rod'' Williams and
center Sean Rooks to Denver for forwards Chris Gatling and Popeye
Jones and a second-round pick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know they like Popeye, because nine months ago they asked me
about Popeye and we didn't want to give him up, because he is such
a good solid guy,'' Hughes said yesterday. ``But they haven't
talked to us about Gatling, so I don't know where that's coming
from.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said the Nuggets do not plan to trade either of their two
second-round picks. He also said the Nuggets have talked to every
team in the league, but to four about a possible trade. He said he
already has 10 deals on the table.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know who gave out that information \Rabout a
Nuggets-Mavericks trade\S, whether it's an agent a fan or \RMark\S
Cuban,'' Hughes said. ``But it seems amusing to me that if in fact
Dallas is talking about this, which I don't know, then they're
talking about a trade before the Denver Nuggets know about it
\Rhappening\S.''
</P>
<P>
   Gatling, who has a home in North Dallas, was not amused when his
name popped up as trade bait, but he looked at it philosophically.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the trade were made, ``I'll be in a better situation,
because I can turn the key because my house is there. It's not an
inconvenience at all. My cars are there. Everything is there. That
is where I live. It'll be like going home.''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said the Nuggets have no intentions of trading Gatling.
Gatling, who is in the final year of his contract and is seeking an
extension, said this may work to his advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that \Rthe media\S knows about it and all the other teams
know about it, it just opens up \Rthings\S,'' Gatling said. ``So,
they're saying, `Wow, they want to trade Gatling. We want to get in
on that deal. We can use him.'
</P>
<P>
   ``You might get LA \RLakers\S calling, Portland calling.''

LITTON PICKS ITS NEW CEO
</HEADLINE>

c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Litton Industries Inc., the nation's largest
builder of non-nuclear ships for the U.S. Navy, has named former
TRW Inc. executive Ronald D. Sugar as successor to Chief Executive
Officer Michael Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Sugar, 51, was named president and chief operating officer of
Litton and will succeed Brown as chief executive officer by Dec.
31, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to become a contributing member of the management team
and think about how we want to take the company forward over the
next few years,'' Sugar said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, 59, will retain the chairman's title. He succeeded former
chief executive officer John Leonis in 1998 and became chairman
when Leonis reached the company's mandatory retirement age of 65 in
1999, said Randy Belote, a spokesman with Litton in Arlington, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Sugar, the former head of TRW's Cleveland-based aerospace and
information systems unit, will also be nominated for election to
the company's board of directors at the Litton annual shareholders
meeting in December.
</P>
<P>
   As president and chief operating officer, Sugar said his first
priority will be to learn how the giant defense and electronics
company operates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take some time but I'm a quick learner,'' Sugar
said. ``I will spend the time getting to know the customers and
products.''
</P>
<P>
   Before joining TRW, Sugar held positions at The Aerospace Corp.,
Hughes Aircraft Co. and Argosystems Inc. He was recently appointed
by President Bill Clinton to the National Security
Telecommunications Advisory Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was with TRW for nearly 20 years,'' he said. ``That really
allowed me to see all the different dimensions of a large business.
It's the kind of background that will serve me well as the
president of Litton.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Belote said the company's Agoura Hills-based Data
Systems division had been awarded a $17 million contract from the
U.S. Navy for continued production of 10 AN/UPX 24(V) Interrogator
Sets.
</P>
<P>
   Deliveries for the 30-month contract will begin in September
2001, he said. The contract also includes retrofit kits for field
change installation on systems now operational on guided missile
cruisers and destroyers.
</P>
<P>
   The system provides target data to a ship's command, control,
communications, computer and intelligence systems through a digital
interface, and generates antenna and interrogation commands in
response to system requests for priority target identification.
</P>
<P>
   Based in Woodland Hills, Litton has more than 40,000 employees
and $5 billion in annual revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Litton closed down $1.44 Thursday at $43.63 on volume
of 229,300 shares on the New York Stock Exchange.

BELCHER TURNS IN ANOTHER GOOD EFFORT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Tim Belcher allowed only three hits through
six-plus innings to lead the Anaheim Angels to a 4-3 victory over
the Kansas City Royals Thursday night before 17,805 at Edison
Field.
</P>
<P>
   In his two starts since returning from elbow surgery, Belcher is
2-0 with a 3.18 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   He got plenty of help Thursday, particularly from reliever Mark
Petkovsek, who threw three perfect innings of relief. Petkovsek
retired all nine batters he faced without allowing a ball hit out
of the infield.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel like either start was all that dominating,''
Belcher said. ``I didn't go as deep into the game as I'd like to
go, but for my first two starts, I'll take it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels offense scored just enough, led by Bengie Molina's
two-run homer, an RBI single by Orlando Palmeiro and a three hits
by Darin Erstad.
</P>
<P>
   It was Belcher's first career victory over the Royals, after
going into the game 0-7 against them in his career.
</P>
<P>
   Belcher retired the first two batters of the game before giving
up a two-out walk to Carlos Beltran. And it cost him because
Jermaine Dye followed with a 410-foot home run to center and a 2-0
Royals lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels tied it in the second inning on Molina's two-run
homer, his fifth of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels then took the lead in the third after Erstad led off
with a single to left. And when left fielder Johnny Damon let the
ball skip past him, Erstad raced all the way to third. Orlando
Palmeiro followed with an RBI single, and Mo Vaughn hit a
ground-rule double to right, sending Palmeiro to third.
</P>
<P>
   One out later, Garret Anderson drove him Palmeiro with a
groundout, giving the Angels a 4-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Belcher changed speeds, mixed his pitches and
got a tough Royals hitters _ they rank third in the A.L. in hitting
_ to get themselves out. Belcher walked a batter in the third. He
hit a batter and walked a batter in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   But he didn't allow another hit until Joe Randa led off the
seventh with a single. And when Mark Quinn followed with a double
to center, driving Randa to third, Belcher was done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hadn't seen him in eight or nine years (before this
season),'' Angels manager Mike Scioscia said of Belcher, his
teammate for four seasons with the Dodgers (1988-91). ``What he has
lost in stuff, he's made up for with a mental approach. With any
support from the lineup and the defense, he'll surprise some people
with the number of wins he puts up.''

...CORRECTS OHLMEYER SPELLING 
MILLER WILL LEAVE THEM RANTING FOR MORE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dennis Miller's sports resume . . .
</P>
<P>
   Lemme see, it's gotta be around here somewhere . . .
</P>
<P>
   __ Master of ceremonies for ESPN's first ``ESPY'' awards show.
Made several cracks about Jimmy Johnson's hair that even the coach
laughed at.
</P>
<P>
   __ A member of ``Saturday Night Live'' when Wayne Gretzky
hosted.
</P>
<P>
   __ Sometimes wears a Pittsburgh Pirates hat when showing up to
work on his HBO show.
</P>
<P>
   __ Also hired Chet Forte, the former ``Monday Night Football''
director, to cut his show for a while. Didn't really work out that
well.
</P>
<P>
   All right? Is that enough for ya, babe?
</P>
<P>
   Any more hoops you wanna make the Mr. Bobble-head shimmy through
just to satisfy your insatiable urge to fill predetermined comic
quotas?
</P>
<P>
   Why not order just one more cavity search, just so you can feel
better about yourself while at the same time underscore your
power-hungry need to filter all the riff-raff out of the process of
putting on the most successful prime-time sports show in the
history of the idiot box?
</P>
<P>
   I don't want to get off on a rant here, but Don Ohlhmeyer's game
plan for deciding on Miller as Al Michaels' new bobo for ``Monday
Night Football'' wasn't like deciphering the Rosetta stone.
</P>
<P>
   It's the infotainment factor of the TV age we live in, cha cha.
</P>
<P>
   Football knowledge on a weekly telecast is great, but if you can
find a way to drop in a Nietzsche reference in the same breath at
Ray Nitschke, you've found a nice niche, you knucklehead.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Miller fits _ he doesn't fit the traditional role,
that monotonous rhythm that develops between the play-by-play man
and his analyst that you can set an egg timer to.
</P>
<P>
   When Ohlhmeyer first thought of adding Miller to the ``MNF''
telecast, it was more as an infrequent contributor, he admitted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, you were gonna pigeon me in that Jimmy Kimmel role _
thanks,'' Miller cracked during a conference call with reporters
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Turned out, Miller knew enough to host his own sports-talk show,
which is something anyone in these parts already knew based on the
frequent appearances he'd make with Forte and Steve Hartman when
they co-hosted the ``Loose Cannons'' show for XTRA-AM (690) several
years ago before Forte's death.
</P>
<P>
   Turned out, Miller was available. His HBO show runs from January
to August. His Monday nights in the fall are open, unless he's
pimping for another long-distance carrier or bag of candy-coated
chocolates.
</P>
<P>
   Turned out, Rush Limbaugh and Jim Rome had too many other
commitments.
</P>
<P>
   So while Dan Fouts will be there to provide the other bearded
opinion in the booth, Miller's stand-up act will have a new
platform, despite what he says about probably reining in the
obscure references for the general masses.
</P>
<P>
   At least it should be interesting. That's all any viewer can ask
for in a prime-time dumping ground of Ted Danson comebacks.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Miller's act won't work with middle America and he's
become almost a parody of his former sharp-tongued self, let
everyone else go to the sports bar to watch ``MNF'' if they can't
listen to him.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: It'll work. It's fresh.
</P>
<P>
   But then again, Ohlhmeyer could be wrong.
</P>
<P>
   __ How 'bout ``The Big Scab'': Striking members of the Screen
Actors Guild (SAG) and the American Federation of Television and
Radio Artists (AFTRA) have for the last two months been pretty loud
about feeling they've been treated unfairly by the advertising
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, Shaquille O'Neal missed a few meetings.
</P>
<P>
   The two unions continue to fire off some serious threats at
O'Neal for his stooping to do the trite ``I'm going to Disneyland''
plug at the end of Game 6 at the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal's agent, Leonard Armato, manages to keep a straight face
when he contends that the spots are practically public-service
announcements since Shaq is donating the proceeds to his charity
for disadvantaged kids.
</P>
<P>
   SAG officials say the media-savvy Shaq, who should know better
considering his movie career, could be fined, suspended or expelled
for this selfish indiscretion. But somehow, you know he'll get
around this, just as other athletes such as Marion Jones, Keyshawn
Johnson, Eddie George and Michael Johnson have done.
</P>
<P>
   Their agents and the companies paying them defend the
appearances by saying they're not taking jobs away from actors and
are contractually bound to shoot the spots.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods and Nomar Garciaparra, on the other hand, recently
declined doing commercials because of the strike.
</P>
<P>
   __ Tribal matters: Fox Sports Net's ``11 p.m. Regional Sports
Report'' dives off the dirt cliff Wednesday in these parts, hoping
not to make the thud you've been seeing during those inspired
commercials, on which the network might spend up to $10 million, to
announce its arrival.
</P>
<P>
   The half-hour edition wants not only to give viewers ``sports
news from the only region you care about _ yours'' but directly
compete with the local sportscasts in L.A. (which occasionally
stretch to three minutes long on a slow car-chaseless night) as
well as snuff out the ESPN ``SportsCenter'' late-night show that
continues to be more of a national focus.
</P>
<P>
   Executive producer Milt Weiss has already hired two anchors _
Barry LeBrock and Gaard Swanson _ but a third candidate, John
Fricke, hasn't been able to get out of his contract with Clear
Channel radio. He has six months remaining on that deal to continue
on XTRA-AM (690) as the morning show co-host. Reporters Lisa
Guerrero and Suzy Shuster have also been hired.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss said he must have viewed hundreds of tapes of potential
on-air talent. But even in this personality-driven market, he says
the content of the show is what will distinguish it from other
Roggin-esque presentations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be less talent and more content,'' said Weiss, in
Seattle earlier this week for that regional's show launch. ``If you
don't have the information or superior highlights . . . that's the
key as far as I'm concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   __ All in the family: It was crazy enough that Keith Olbermann's
mom was hit in the face _ right between the eyes in fact _ by a
wild throw from Yankees second baseman Chuck Knoblauch during a
game against the White Sox last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Even more weird, Olbermann had to narrate the clip of the
incident during Fox's baseball studio show later that day.
</P>
<P>
   ``And his throw . . . !ital!hits my mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Marie Olbermann was sitting in the season seats at Yankee
Stadium behind the first-base dugout that the family has had since
1972.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's fine,'' Keith said this week. ``Two mild shiners.
Nothing broken. She even went back for Sunday's game, and more
applause.''
</P>
<P>
   To him, the most surreal thing about all this was seeing his mom
in the New York newspapers _ she made the front page of the Daily
News, plus three stories inside, and page three of the Post. But
Olbermann also said it's been kind of disheartening to find out
that no one from the team called to inquire about her injury.
</P>
<P>
   Only Yankees manager Joe Torre _ who did play-by-play of the
Angels in the late '80s for KTLA at the same time Olbermann was an
anchor at the station _ seemed concerned enough to ask reporters
the next day about her condition.
</P>
<P>
   But she's getting some media exposure out of this. Olbermann
promises an ``exclusive interview'' with his mom on this Saturday's
Fox pregame show before the Dodgers game in St. Louis.

   WHAT SMOKES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   __ TV Guide's somewhat gutsy move for putting out
special-edition Lakers covers on the June 24-30 issue. The series
released with pictures of the Lakers' Shaquille O'Neal, Kobe
Bryant, Rick Fox and Glen Rice proclaiming ``Dynasty Two'' was
actually distributed to newsstands Monday afternoon _ well before
Game 6 and before it was known if a Game 7 was needed. What if the
Lakers blew those last two games? Then they'd really be collector's
items (at just $1.79 a piece). Lakers play-by-play man Chick Hearn
wrote the story inside, comparing this team to Lakers teams of the
past, couching it with such phrases as ``the Lakers became a
championship-caliber team'' because of Phil Jackson. While the
greater Southern California market got this cover, the rest of the
country had to deal with the new cast from MTV's ``Real World.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   __ The quiet departure of Ferdie Pacecho from boxing telecasts
after nearly 25 years. When Showtime does the delay telecast of
Saturday night's (9 p.m.) bout in Scotland between Mike Tyson and
Lou Savarese, ``The Fight Doctor'' won't be there, having announced
his retirement during last week's broadcast of the Andrew
Golota-Orlin Norris bout. Showtime plans for a Pacecho special
called ``The Twelve Greatest Rounds of the 20th Century'' to air in
the fall. For now, the Showtime boxing team will exist with Steve
Albert and Bobby Czyz. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   __ Meanwhile, HBO's replay of last week's Shane Mosley-Oscar De
La Hoya bout, which drew $37 million from 700,000 buys at $49.95 to
make it the second-biggest nonheavyweight title bout ever, is
Saturday at 10:45 p.m. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   __ Did you know: Tiger Woods was shown 407 times totaling 93
minutes and 23 seconds during his four-hour round Sunday at the
U.S. Open, according to sophisticated data collected by New York
Times reporter Richard Sandomir. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   __ NBC's Bob Costas said it on Wednesday as a guest on CBS'
Craig Kilborn's show, in reference to the rioting that took place
outside Staples Center after Game 6: ``An ESPN truck was torched .
. . by Fox Sports West.'' &QL; 
WHAT CHOKES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   __ Isiah Thomas' agenda. Throughout the NBA Finals, the NBC
studio analyst danced around media speculation about his probable
future as Larry Bird's replacement as coach of the Indiana Pacers.
But then remember, Thomas predicted the Pacers would beat the
Lakers in six games. Why? ``I think the Pacers are the smartest
team playing basketball right now,'' he said before Game 1. ``If
they can keep games close, I think they can win because of their
intellectual capacity.'' Now, NBC's intellectual capacity has to be
questioned for allowing him to stay on during the series. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   __ Wonder how ESPN2 reached 70 million quicker than any other
cable channel in history? By airing quality programming such as
``Magic The Gathering'' tournaments, as it did Tuesday this week.

</P>
<P>
   On a night the Yankees may have tilted the balance of power
further in their favor by adding strongman Juan Gonzalez from
Detroit, Ramon the Elder reminded the Bombers that the road to
another World Series may yet have to pass through the brothers
Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, who were entertaining thoughts of a four-game sweep
when they beat Pedro the Younger Tuesday night, instead left town
with a split after falling, 4-2, to Ramon and the Red Sox. The
Yankees may have left with a consolation prize, however: They
reportedly came to terms Thursday with the Tigers on a deal for
Gonzalez, contingent on the two-time American League most valuable
player agreeing to waive his no-trade clause and coming to terms on
a new contract extension. That may not be a slam dunk; there were
already reports Thursday night that Gonzalez had turned thumbs-down
on the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rich get richer, don't they?'' said Sox outfielder Darren
Lewis of the Gonzalez reports. ``He (Yankees owner George
Steinbrenner) ain't afraid to spend his loot, is he?''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Sons of Jimy Williams left for Toronto a
half-game ahead of the Yankees and Blue Jays after winning the last
two games of the series, though Nomar Garciaparra gave another full
house at Fenway Park (33,744) a severe fright that summer was about
to come to a sudden end.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra, backpedaling into short center field in the seventh
inning to catch a popup by outfielder Ricky Ledee, collided with
center fielder Carl Everett as he made the catch, tumbling backward
over the fallen Everett. Garciaparra flipped the ball into the
infield from his knees before rolling over in pain, clutching his
right ankle.
</P>
<P>
   While trainer Jim Rowe sprinted Wendell Kim-like to
Garciaparra's side, teammates and Williams gathered around the Red
Sox shortstop, whose two doubles had contributed mightily to two
rallies. But after a brief but anxious interlude in which the
tropical night air was sucked out of the Back Bay, Garciaparra rose
to his feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew he was all right,'' said Lewis, the closest eyewitness.
``Carl started sliding even before he hit Nomie. When I was talking
to him, he was cool.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a California boy, tough. Old school. It's either-or in
California. You're either real soft or pretty tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra, who was swathed in icepacks after the game, hobbled
to his cubicle and cracked jokes about the play with Everett.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt pain in my calf and my ankle,'' said Garciaparra, who
lined a double into the left-field corner to start the Sox' two-run
second, then hit a gapper for another RBI double in their two-run
third. ``Right now it feels all right, but it's the thought of
waking up tomorrow with it stiffening up that scares me.''
</P>
<P>
   There wasn't a trace of fear Thursday night in Martinez, who
struck out a season-high seven batters and allowed just four hits
in 6 2/3 innings to run his record to 6-4, including two wins
against the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez gave up a two-run home run to Bernie Williams in the
first inning _ the Bombers hit 10 home runs in the series to none
for the Sox _ but did not allow another Yankee to advance past
second base until he was lifted with two outs and a man on first in
the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   When Shane Spencer singled with one out in the seventh, Williams
headed for the mound, mindful that Martinez, who would wind up
throwing 123 pitches, was pushing his limit. Catcher Jason Varitek,
the third party to the conference on the mound, said he assumed the
manager planned to summon a fresh arm to face the
lefthanded-hitting Ledee.
</P>
<P>
   That typically is the Williams way, but not Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically in my mind I wanted him to get Ledee,'' Williams
said. ``In my mind I left him in there to get the out. I know he's
a tough lefthanded hitter; we were leaving it open at first base,
and I knew where he was in the pitch count, but I went with the
man. That's basically what I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramon, remember, has had plenty of practice at being The Man
well before little brother came along. ``He's got to give me a
chance,'' Martinez said. ``And that's what he did, he gave me a
chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez coaxed the popup out of Ledee that caused the pileup in
center field, then was startled to see Williams come out again,
this time with the hook.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting better and better,'' said Martinez, who has now
allowed three runs or fewer in nine of his 13 starts, and is 6-1 in
those outings. ``By the time he came out, I had thrown a lot of
pitches, but it still felt fine.''
</P>
<P>
   It felt even better that the Red Sox came away with the split,
after some deft relief work by Bryce Florie, Rich Garces, and Derek
Lowe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's big because of the way we played the first two games,''
said Varitek, whose sacrifice fly accounted for one of the four
runs off Yankees rookie Jake Westbrook, stand-in for the disabled
Roger Clemens (groin).
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to play well, and it really starts with our
pitching. We're not going to score too many runs. We might one day,
when more than one or two people get hot, but that's what this team
is built on. We need to pitch well.''

A CHANCE TO NET A STAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gerry Cheevers figures he was 25 years old by the time he fully
grasped the job. There is a protracted learning curve in the art of
paddle and glove.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's when you finally have that feeling that you're better
than the shooter,'' recalled the Bruins' Hall of Fame netminder.
``Every time he comes down the ice _ even if it's Pavel Bure today
_ you've got the confidence to think, `OK, I've got him.' ''
</P>
<P>
   John Davidson figures he was about a year older, maybe 26, when
he could say his game was fully shaped. By then, he was six years
beyond the day in June when the St. Louis Blues made him the No. 5
pick overall in the 1973 amateur draft.
</P>
<P>
   The first netminder ever to jump directly from junior hockey to
the NHL, Davidson wishes his transition into the pro game had been
slower.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted it, and I thought I was ready for it,'' recalled
Davidson, now a renowned analyst whose best years ultimately came
with the Rangers. ``But I don't think I was ready _ for the amount
of games, for the pressure, everything. Today, I'd recommend what
the Devils organization does with just about all of its players,
give them a couple of years in the minors and then bring 'em up.''
</P>
<P>
   In the hours leading up to the National Hockey League entry
draft that begins Saturday morning in Calgary, the name creating
the greatest buzz has been Rick DiPietro, the 18-year-old netminder
from Winthrop who decided weeks ago to forfeit his final three
years at Boston University and launch his pro career. DiPietro will
go high in the first round, with the chance of being only the
second netminder selected first overall.
</P>
<P>
   No matter where he is selected, however, history shows that
DiPietro cannot reasonably be expected to make an immediate leap
from Babcock Street to the NHL. He will sign a three-year
entry-level contract, making him an instant millionaire, but he
could be fortunate to get his first NHL action before his contract
expires June 30, 2003.
</P>
<P>
   The game's philosophy is changing. Once, goalies rarely were
picked in the first round. But in the past three seasons, no fewer
than eight netminders have been selected in the opening round. One,
Roberto Luongo, chosen fourth overall by the Islanders in '97, is
widely considered a potential franchise goalie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there's been a reluctance to use a high pick on a
goalie over the years,'' said Cheevers, now one of the Bruins' top
scouts. ``But my feeling is, if you're high on a kid, and you think
he's gonna do the job for you, then so what if he's 18 or 19? If
you solve that problem with a kid that young, you've solved it for
a long, long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Caron, now retiring at age 70 as a St. Louis Blues
executive, was of that mind in 1970 when, as overseer of the draft
for the Canadiens, he selected Flin Flon netminder Ray Martyniuk
with the No. 5 pick overall. It was a bold move. At the time, only
a half-dozen netminders ever had been chosen in the first round.
Ken Dryden, originally a Bruins draft pick (14th overall, a
third-rounder, in '64), had yet to arrive in the Forum as the
Canadiens' savior.
</P>
<P>
   ``You draft a kid, and he's a prospect,'' Caron said the other
day, thinking back some 30 years. ``If he doesn't make it in a
couple of years, he goes from prospect to suspect. And if he
doesn't make it in another year or two, he's gone from prospect to
suspect _ to reject.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, such was the career path of Martyniuk. He kicked
around in the minors for a few years but never made it. All the
more bitter for Habs fans was how history played out: Darryl
Sittler, selected eighth in the draft by Toronto, went on to become
a Hall of Fame pivot.
</P>
<P>
   Caron went to Flin Flon to scout Bobby Clarke, selected 17th
overall by the Flyers in '69, but was taken by Martyniuk's skills.
In St. Louis, Caron recalled, Scotty Bowman was saying that
Martyniuk was the best young netminder in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   But all the hype and hope meant nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning teams always lead you to a lot of high selections,''
reflected Caron, noting what a powerhouse the Flin Flon Bombers had
been with the likes of Clarke and Martyniuk. ``That's fine. But you
must make sure that the reason a team is a winner is because your
candidate played a key role in the club's success.''
</P>
<P>
   Davidson figures league expansion and subsequent parity have
made it even more essential, in fact imperative, for clubs to
consider using their top pick on a goalie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely,'' he said. ``Every team now has a quality goalie.
If you don't have one, you're dead. Obviously, you've got to look
at the overall draft, and what else is available. But to me,
there's no reason not to take a goalie. Look at what Grant Fuhr did
for the Oilers.''
</P>
<P>
   Fuhr, selected eighth overall by Edmonton in '81, was the
backbone of four Stanley Cup championships and is a certain Hall of
Famer. In '83, the Sabres made Tom Barrasso, only days out of
Acton-Boxboro High School, the fifth pick overall. By the fall, he
was a regular in the Buffalo net, was the rookie of the year, and
went on to win a pair of Cups (with Pittsburgh). The Flyers used
the 22d pick overall in '95, a first-rounder, to select Brian
Boucher from Woonsocket, R.I. With Boucher in net this spring, the
Flyers came within one victory of reaching the Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't kid yourself,'' said Caron. ``What Boucher did this year
will play in DiPietro's favor.''
</P>
<P>
   For every Fuhr, Barrasso, and Boucher, however, there are
countless other highly touted teenage netminders, including some
first-rounders who never made it or have yet to see their NHL
careers truly blossom. Witness, in recent years: Jimmy Waite, Eric
Fichaud, Jocelyn Thibault.
</P>
<P>
   So sure were the Canadiens that Thibault, a No. 10 pick by
Quebec in 1993, would be a franchise goalie, they dealt Patrick Roy
to get him. Thibault, now 25, is with the Blackhawks, still trying
to play up to his billing. Roy, at age 34, remains the franchise
netminder in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's the same thing that you get with every position,''
said Davidson. ``There are going to be busts. If you feel sure
about a guy, and you feel his game is complete, I think you have to
do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a risk. But it could be a bigger risk not to take him.''

FRIDAY NOTES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The beating Sugar Shane Mosley administered to Oscar De La Hoya
last Saturday night might not have equaled the humbling the Top
Rank promoter Bob Arum gave the Staples Center's president, Tim
Leiweke.
</P>
<P>
   According to California State Athletic Commission records, the
match didn't quite do at the gate what the wide-eyed Leiweke
thought it would do when last March he guaranteed Arum $5 million
to stage it at the new downtown facility.
</P>
<P>
   Although Staples Center officials announced afterward that the
fight was a 20,744 sellout, the CSAC reports only 15,643 tickets
were paid for, meaning 5,131 fans or a fourth of the crowd watched
the proceedings free of charge.
</P>
<P>
   In the stirring parlance of boxing, this is what's known as a
papered house.
</P>
<P>
   And many of the tickets that were sold, especially in the $900
and $700 range, were discounted to as low as $250. It's known one
Las Vegas casino even was given a 2-for-1 ticket bargain.
</P>
<P>
   The net from the fight after taxes was $5,804, 189.80, which did
not meet the lofty pre-fight expectations of Leiweke, who had
optimistically predicted an $8 million gate.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Leiweke, it didn't reach such a plateau and
insiders are claiming the Staples Center's first foray into boxing
resulted in a seven-figure loss.
</P>
<P>
   For months, or ever since the De La Hoya-Mosley match was
officially announced on March 20, you were told that it was certain
to be a sellout.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, only a couple of days after tickets went on sale to the
public, the propaganda minister of Arum's organization, Bill
``Bozo'' Caplan, frantically called around to various media outlets
to announce more than 18,000 already had been peddled.
</P>
<P>
   This gave the impression the fight was a runaway attraction, and
that those who were interested in seeing it better rush out
immediately and purchase tickets.
</P>
<P>
   A time-honored PR person's ploy.
</P>
<P>
   Harmless enough, for sure, but a deception, nevertheless.
</P>
<P>
   Repeated phone calls to Tim Leiweke were not returned, and it's
not surprising.
</P>
<P>
   The guy's probably embarrassed by the way he got skinned by
Arum, although he's certainly not the first boxing tenderfoot to
endure such treatment.
</P>
<P>
   You can be sure of one future certainty.
</P>
<P>
   The De La Hoya-Mosley rematch won't be at the Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   I don't think Tim Leiweke and the Staples Center are in business
to blow money. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Bob Arum finally made his first mistake with Oscar De La Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   He should never have matched him against Sugar Shane Mosley in
the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Mosley simply is a better fighter than De La Hoya faster,
quicker, wiser, tougher, stronger and more durable.
</P>
<P>
   It's almost laughable to me to hear the litany of excuses being
offered on behalf of De La Hoya in the wake of his split decision
loss to Mosley, including the lamest of all by De La Hoya, who
incredibly felt he was jobbed by the officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess the only way I can win a fight anymore is to knock my
opponent out,'' groused De La Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   No, there is another way you can win, Oscar beat the guy you're
fighting in the ring.
</P>
<P>
   You didn't do this against Felix Trinidad, when you embarrassed
your sport and yourself by giving a rousing impersonation of the
Italian Army, circa World War II, by going into a full retreat
during the final three rounds.
</P>
<P>
   And you certainly didn't do it against Mosley, who exposed you
for what you are at this juncture of your career a formidable
fighter simply no longer formidable enough to beat the best in your
division.
</P>
<P>
   And anyone who doesn't think Sugar Shane Mosley isn't the best
welterweight in the world at the moment will be given a free class
in the Marty Sammon School of Fight Scoring. . . .
</P>
<P>
   What fight was Marty Sammon watching last Saturday night? Any
imbecile who thought De La Hoya deserved a two-point victory and S
with his 115-113 scorecard should never be allowed to judge a fight
again. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Actually, I'm wrong. Oscar De La Hoya could well beat Sugar
Shane Mosley in Las Vegas, where Bob Arum is a dominant figure and
where the officials almost always dutifully follow his cue (except,
of course in the De La Hoya-Trinidad fight when Don King was
involved in t too).
</P>
<P>
   Mosley will beat De La Hoya again, but could lose the decision,
an injustice that almost happened last Saturday night. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, Oscar De La Hoya, who has to blame someone for his
demise, is set to get rid of his longtime trainer, Robert Alcazar,
done several times in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``If De La Hoya is going to bring in still another new trainer,
why doesn't he bring in the best, D. Wayne Lukas?'' cracked the old
Olympic Auditorium publicist, Van ``Hate 'Em All'' Barbieri, fresh
as ever. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Notice how almost all the media analysis of the De La
Hoya-Mosley fight is from De La Hoya's perspective, which I find
odd since Mosley was the deserved winner and clearly the superior
fighter. . . .
</P>
<P>
   If I'm Bob Arum, I don't dare match De La Hoya against Mosley
again, for another De La Hoya loss would irreparably damage De La
Hoya as a pay-per-view phenomenon, if he's not already tarnished in
the aftermath of his latest disappointing performance. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Sugar Shane Mosley reminds me of a combination Pernell Whitaker
and Aaron Pryor, with a pinch of Sugar Ray Leonard. . . .
</P>
<P>
   __ Finally, Mike Tyson is getting terrific press coverage for
his Saturday night Showtime fight in Scotland against Lou Savarese
for roughing up the English promoter, Frank Warren. Tyson's
deportment outside the ring these days is far more compelling than
what he does inside. . . .
</P>
<P>
   __ The bottom line Monday night after the Lakers won their world
title is that tyranny raged around the Staples Center, and that the
have rounded up these cowardly punks and given Shaquille O'Neal the
opportunity to dunk them through a basketball hoop. . . .
</P>
<P>
   __ Dancing Barry Clifford, the Long Beach-based maitre d' to the
stars, is now strutting his stuff at upscale Sorrento's in Laguna
Beach, where Mark McGwire often dines with his parents during the
off-season. . . .
</P>
<P>
   The late Syrian dictator, Hafez Assad, may have had his faults,
but never have I felt safer walking the streets at night in a major
city than I did last January when I visited Damascus. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Tom Hennessy's terrific story Thursday on the phony passing
himself off for years as a Navy Seal Vietnam War hero reminded me
of a long ago incident at the old Adams Gym on PCH where I met a
creep passing himself off as a player with the Los Angeles Rams.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, I was the Rams beat writer for the Los Angeles
Herald Examiner, and knew every player on the team. Brazenly, I
informed the impersonator of this fact, and the guy never was seen
again at the gym after my cruel admission.

 &HT;    NEW PLAY EXAMINES THE TWO FACES OF NAZI ARCHITECT, SPEER
 &HT;    With Photos.
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (l) Lifestyle categories.
 &HT;    For Use Sat., June 24 And Thereafter.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ How can an apparently honorable man take part in an
unspeakable evil and then find a way to live with himself?
</P>
<P>
   This is the central question of ``Albert Speer,'' a new play in
London that pursues its unsettling answers through a 3 1/2-hour
examination of the confessions and equivocations of Nazi leader
Adolph Hitler's pet architect and armaments minister.
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Trevor Nunn, the play is based on the successful
1995 biography by Gitta Sereny, ``Albert Speer: His Battle with
Truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Sereny, an Austrian-born Briton, wrote the 720-page book nearly
20 years after a three-week interview she had with Speer, who died
in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Because of his high position in the Nazi regime and his
willingness to write about his experiences, Speer long has been an
important figure in the effort to understand the inner workings of
the Third Reich.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the confessional and analytical nature of his books,
he has been widely regarded as ``the good Nazi.'' He maintained to
his death that he was unaware of the Holocaust until after the war.
</P>
<P>
   However, this assertion has come under attack in recent years by
Sereny and other writers who doubt that Speer could have been so
comfortably ignorant.
</P>
<P>
   This perspective is embraced by playwright David Edgar, best
known to Americans for his adaptation of Dickens' ``Nicholas
Nickleby'' in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Edgar explores the Speer story in two acts. The first represents
Speer's version, a portrayal that is faithful to his books,
``Inside the Third Reich'' and ``Spandau Diaries.''
</P>
<P>
   The scene opens with Speer's reporting to Spandau prison in
Berlin to begin the 20-year sentence handed down during the
Nuremberg trials. In the background of the scene are Nazi war
</P>
<P>
   criminals dangling by their necks _ a fate escaped by Speer.
</P>
<P>
   Despite an intelligent rendering of Speer by Alex Jennings, the
first act is stolen by Roger Allam's mesmerizing Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   Allam plays the Fuehrer as an intensely charming prophet with a
grand vision of a strong, pure Germany that will need _ and here's
where the young architect Speer comes in _ a spectacular new
capital on the magnitude of ancient Rome.
</P>
<P>
   Hitler comes across as an engaging, good listener with Old World
manners and a gift for flattery. He casts a Faustian spell over the
ambitious young Speer and elevates him to be the second most
powerful man in the Reich.
</P>
<P>
   At one point Speer tries to explain how Hitler's charismatic
appeal worked on intelligent, stable Germans _ such as Speer:
``Eighty million people didn't follow him because he was evil but
</P>
<P>
   because they thought he was extremely good!''
</P>
<P>
   In her book, Sereny describes an emotional even ``erotic''
relationship between the two men. Hitler saw the handsome young
Speer as the Aryan of his warped dreams. To Speer, Hitler was the
father-figure he never had. In the play, Speer's own father regards
his son's role in the Reich with icy contempt.
</P>
<P>
   This theme unfolds as a dark love story that only begins to
unravel in the horror of the last years of the war when Hitler's
loathsome insanity becomes obvious even to Speer.
</P>
<P>
   The moment of revelation comes during one of the play's most
memorable moments. Hitler _ now clearly disjointed and drained _
sits slumped against Speer's white model of the majestic dome that
he designed as centerpiece of the imperial Reich capital that never
was.
</P>
<P>
   Hitler rages at the cowards and inferiors who failed him in his
quest to rid the world of the ``Jewish-Bolshevik conspiracy.''
Speer, at last recognizing Hitler for what he was, bravely resists
the Fuehrer's final demand that he destroy Germany to deprive the
weaklings left behind with any means to recover from the war.
</P>
<P>
   Act 1 closes with a chilling 1943 speech made by Heinrich
Himmler, the Nazi SS leader who directed the program of mass
killing. Himmler reveals the full horror of the ``Final Solution.''
</P>
<P>
   The second act, which shows Speer after his release, shifts from
Speer's account of what happened and begins to chip away at his
story.
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of the play, Speer is portrayed not as sinner
seeking redemption but as a man seeking comfort in denial.
</P>
<P>
   Described by one character as a ``rent-a-penitent,'' Speer makes
the university and bookstore circuit dogged always by questions
about his role in the Reich. The questions in time overcome his
comfortable and practiced responses.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, he is forced to confront himself and the ghost of
Hitler in dreams that allow him no escape from his reality.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, he confesses that he must have known _ even though
he could never bring himself to acknowledge what had happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sensed, and turned away from what I sensed,'' Speer says
with horror.

   MERDORE BORDER CROSSING, Yugoslavia _ She called it the ``worst
torture.''
</P>
<P>
   Alma Berisha's 45-year-old husband, Renor, was rounded up and
jailed 14 months ago by Serb paramilitaries. For months she and her
family awaited word of his fate. They then paid thousands of
dollars in bribes for his freedom. And then they had to wait some
more.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't know the agony of not knowing if someone is alive or
dead,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   In the closing days of last year's 78-day NATO bombing campaign
against Yugoslavia, Serb military and paramilitary gangs wreaked a
final round of terror as they retreated, rounding up thousands of
Kosovar Albanians and throwing many of them in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Today, more than 1,100 ethnic Albanians, including old men,
women and teenagers under 18, remain in limbo in Serb jails, in
part because Western diplomats, rushing to finalize a cease-fire
agreement with the Serb-dominated Yugoslav government, deleted from
the document thorny provisions covering prisoner exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   While politicians defended this choice as politically expedient,
it has fostered a web of corruption within Serbia that charge
families between US$7,000 and US$15,000 to secure the release of
their relatives. In the last year, close to 1,000 Kosovar Albanians
have been freed from Serb jails, and Red Cross officials estimate
that 90 percent of those releases came after bribes paid by
families.
</P>
<P>
   The system, aid officials here say, is unjust, but they complain
that the strained political relationship between the international
community and Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic keeps their
hands tied in the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in the hands of Belgrade,'' Nic Sommers, spokesman for
the International Committee of the Red Cross in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   For the Berisha family, left with no political lifeline to help
free Renor, a former schoolteacher in his hometown of Djakova, in
western Kosovo, the choice was simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you speak of money or a life, there is no choice. You
pay,'' Alma Berisha said.
</P>
<P>
   After her husband's disappearance on May 13 last year, Alma
finally learned Renor was alive on Sept. 25. His name had been
published by the Red Cross, who gained access to many prisoners
after the war.
</P>
<P>
   The spunky 31-year-old with short curly, black hair, traveled to
the prison four times to visit Renor, reporting back to the family
that he was in good health and was treated humanely. But he had no
hope for release until February, when an Albanian lawyer named Ismi
Bytygi called the family.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer said he could make a deal with the Serbs to free
Renor. The cost: US$7,500.
</P>
<P>
   The Berishas scrounged together the cash, gave it to the lawyer.
And, for three more months, no word came.
</P>
<P>
   The tension during this time was unbearable, Alma recalled. Her
4-year-old son, Renlend, insisted his home set a plate at his dad's
place at the dinner table ``so we could feel nearer to him,'' she
said. But the empty place hung heavily on her.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the worst torture. This waiting time,'' Alma said
during an interview with Cox Newspapers last month at their family
home.
</P>
<P>
   Later that night, without any warning, the family received a
phone call they had been waiting for: 17 Albanians would be
released at the Merdore Border Crossing the next day, and Renor
would be among them.
</P>
<P>
   Quickly, the Berishas flew into motion. With less than 24 hours
to prepare, Alma was overcome with apprehension. She elected to
stay home with Renlend and other women in the family to prepare the
welcome home feast, while her brothers-in-law and her older son,
12-year-old Shefki, drove the four hours to the border to greet
Renor.
</P>
<P>
   When they reached Merdore in the early afternoon of May 30, a
crowd of about 100 people _ family members who also were waiting
for their relatives _ had already gathered.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere along the two-lane road felt like an airport when
an arriving plane is late. People attempted nervous small talk, not
daring to speak what each feared, that their husband, son or sister
would not appear.
</P>
<P>
   All of the 17 families said they paid to free their relatives.
None believed that the money was used for court fees or defense
investigations, but simply got passed along as bribes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who cares whose pockets I line or where it all ends up. What
is money, when you are talking about a human life?'' said one man
who paid US$10,000 to have his 21-year-old son released.
</P>
<P>
   As shadows lengthened across the grain fields dotted with red
poppies and the heat slipped from the late spring day, the tension
collapsed into wails of joy, like a clap of lightning followed by
raindrops.
</P>
<P>
   A three-vehicle convoy of white minibuses had been glimpsed down
the road across the stretch of no-man's land. Slowly, 15 men and
two women got out of the vehicles and walked single file under a
concrete railroad bridge and across the border to freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Renor came into view at the end of the line. He walked strongly,
with hands swinging, past Serb guards and into the arms of his
family.
</P>
<P>
   The Berishas smothered him in kisses, while he scooped his son
into his arms. Miealthy was still too overcome with emotion to
speak.
</P>
<P>
   The only member of the family who could find words through the
tears was Shefki, who wore a wide grin across his freckled face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I'm very happy. My dad has missed so much,'' the lanky
youngster said. ``He's not fat anymore. Now, I'll have to tease him
about something else.''

<P>
   SEOUL _ When Christopher McCarthy, a 22-year-old American
soldier, escaped from U.S. military custody after he was accused of
murdering a South Korean bar hostess for refusing sex with him, it
fed the belief among South Koreans that Americans believe they're
above the law.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy was apprehended eight hours later and was sentenced by
a South Korean court this month to eight years in prison. However,
that incident was the latest in a series of events, including the
surprisingly successful summit between North and South Korea, that
has stoked calls for less interference from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's a very strong anti-American sentiment
right now, but I think it's growing,'' said Jung-Hoon Lee,
professor of international relations at Yonsei University in Seoul.
``The summit contributed to it because of its focus on independence
and autonomy.''
</P>
<P>
   Reunification of the two Koreas is seen by some South Koreans as
an issue that can be resolved by Koreans only.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Kim Jong Il's new look ... (showing) he can be friendly,
smile, be jovial, a very confident leader, (some people) feel, we
can do some business with this guy and Americans only serve as a
possible roadblock,'' said Lee. ``So that sort of feeds on
anti-American sentiment that was already there. There's a sense
that we should do this alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there have always been factions in Korea _ especially
among the left-wing and the younger generations - who believe U.S.
troops should go home.
</P>
<P>
   Massive student demonstrations in the 1970s and '80s are
characterized as anti-American but were more directed at the
military dictators who ruled South Korea, said Lee. But because of
the military alliance between the two countries, the United States
was seen as tolerating or approving of the dictatorships, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many students still feel Korea is being used by Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States thinks of Korea as their colony,'' said Soo
Jin Park, a 25-year-old student at Yonsei University. ``Not on
paper, but by the way they act, Koreans get that impression.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the 37,000 American troops in Korea should leave
``because we're not at war and I see no reason for them to stay in
Korea.''
</P>
<P>
   While such sentiments are common on university campuses,
analysts agree they do not represent the mainstream view in Korea.
</P>
<P>
   However, there is a growing belief _ even among people who would
identify themselves as pro-American and have no desire to see
American troops withdraw _ that Washington needs to treat Korea as
more of an equal.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some sense, I must say Korea is controlled by the United
States in many ways,'' said Rev. Young Joon Cho, pastor of Chung
Dong First Methodist Church in Seoul.
</P>
<P>
   Pagoda Park in downtown Seoul is filled with elderly men playing
chess, practicing calligraphy or just passing the time. In one
corner, a retired sociology teacher who would give his name only as
Mr. Kim is holding court with an audience of at least a couple
dozen, lecturing on U.S.-Korean relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States shouldn't look down at Korea,'' he said.
``We're not the Korea of 50 years ago. They should respect Korea as
a full sovereign country and let us solve our own problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the Foreign Ministry believes it is ready for an adjustment
in the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, our relationship has been one of dependence on
U.S. aid,'' said Sung-Hwan Kim, deputy director of the Ministry's
North American bureau. ``Now I feel we're equipped with the
requirements (for a more equal partnership).''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. recognizes that the relationship is an evolving one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Korea has changed from the poorest country in the world in the
fifties and sixties to one of the richest,'' said a U.S. official
based in Korea who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``There's a
constant need to re-evaluate the relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the displeasure towards Americans stems from the Status
of Forces Agreement, which in part governs how U.S. soldiers who
commit crimes or wrongdoings in Korea are handled. From little
things, like not paying traffic tickets, to violent crimes, such as
murder, Koreans feel Americans get away with too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``When (American soldiers) are outside of their campus, they are
not restricted by Korean law, and that's not right,'' said Byung
Chan Son, who owns a small energy consulting firm in Seoul.
``Korean people are very unhappy.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the agreement is currently being renegotiated, as it
periodically is. Kim of the Foreign Ministry said Korea has
proposed several changes, such as requiring indicted American
soldiers to remain in Korean custody instead of American military
custody and requiring American military facilities _ where air and
ground pollution are not subject to regulations _ to adhere to
basic environmental guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the United States must make an effort to ... give the
Korean public at least an appearance that it respects Korea, treats
Korea as an equal partner and that there's a balance in the
bilateral relations,'' said Lee.

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Alfredo Mondragon is from a Mexico so far removed
from modern times, he doesn't know his age and he can't express why
he supports this country's Institutional Revolutionary Party _ the
PRI.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just what we do,'' the Mazahua Indian from rural Mexico
state said. He stood motionless in soiled work clothes among a
throng of 100,000 cheering for the party's presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   High school teacher and union member Flavio Bernal, on the other
hand, has no trouble defending his party with a militant's
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Mexico we live with social peace that the PRI has
guaranteed,'' the 31-year-old Guadalajara resident said, pumping
his fist. ``We know the party has made mistakes, but we don't give
up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Indian peasant and the earnest teacher _ both bused to
Mexico City for a recent rally _ are just two faces of a vast quilt
of support that helps sustain the PRI, the world's longest ruling
political party. For 71 years the PRI (pronounced, ``Pree'') has
controlled this country's presidency and most other political
offices.
</P>
<P>
   But the PRI faces its toughest test ever when Mexicans elect
their next president on July 2. Its candidate, veteran government
economist Francisco Labastida Ochoa, is locked in a bitter fight to
the end with Vicente Fox Quesada, a former Coca-Cola executive and
rancher who has mounted the most effective opposition campaign in
Mexico's modern history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since I entered politics in 1988, my mission has been to
drive the PRI from Los Pinos (the Mexican White House),'' said Fox,
candidate of the conservative National Action Party and coalition
Alliance for Change. ``Mexico can't live with the PRI anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   After seven decades in power _ and half the population in
poverty _ the PRI has a lot of incumbent baggage to carry. If it
loses the election, most political analysts agree, the party would
slide into crisis and jettison its national leadership. But don't
expect it to die.
</P>
<P>
   ``That party has a structure and breadth nobody is going to give
up,'' said Mexico City analyst Joel Estudillo.
</P>
<P>
   The party's boosters argue that while Mexico may be riddled with
problems, the party rose from ashes of the 1910 Mexican Revolution
and managed to turn a feudal backwater into an industrial,
oil-producing nation. The party's enemies, however, say the PRI has
perpetuated corruption and enriched an elite. They blame the party
for forcing millions of Mexico's poor to emigrate to the United
States, and plunging the country into repeated economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Among its detractors, the PRI is often scornfully referred to as
``the system'' or ``the official party'' or simply, ``the
dinosaur.''
</P>
<P>
   Its core support, some analysts say, is now only about 30
percent to 35 percent of Mexico's 58.7 million voters. But a
well-known leftist candidate, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, is also running
for the presidency, so the opposition vote is split, which helps
Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of this divided opposition vote, most opinion polls
show that Fox and Labastida are in a dead heat now among likely
voters. Fox is trying to syphon votes from Cardenas and both are
fighting for the undecided, which could be as much as 20 percent of
the electorate.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI has enormous advantages in this war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now the party is pointing a shotgun and firing
everywhere,'' said Mexico City political analyst Edna Jaime. ``It's
using everything possible to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The PRI has sought to project a ``new PRI,'' more democratic and
more willing to engage in fierce but fair competition with rivals.
</P>
<P>
   For this election, the PRI hired cutting-edge U.S. campaign
strategists, like James Carville, President Clinton's advisor, to
help poll voters and fashion messages. The Austin, Texas-based
Public Strategies Inc., which shapes communications for campaigns,
has assisted in developing international relations.
</P>
<P>
   But in April, when it appeared that Fox was dramatically gaining
ground, the party also called in some controversial old-fashioned
party leaders to join the cause. At least one advisor, Manuel
Bartlett, has a reputation for strong-arm tactics. It's never been
proved, but many Mexicans even think he engineered outright fraud
in the 1988 presidential race to give the PRI the victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``To win an election you have to be inclusive,'' said Javier
Trevino, a Harvard University-educated international affairs
advisor to Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign needs everyone in the party on board to help,
Trevino said, and election rules are so tight today nobody can
commit fraud at the ballot box.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the election we are going to continue to transform the
PRI,'' he added. ``But first we have an objective, which is to win
the election.''
</P>
<P>
   A key part of that strategy remains the PRI's traditional
network of ``corporatist'' organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Over seven decades, the PRI has built a web of pro-party unions
and associations that incorporate farmers, oil workers, industrial
workers, industrialists and government employees into the party's
ranks.
</P>
<P>
   True believers say they support the party because of its rebel
roots and flexible, mixed ideology, borrowing from socialism and
capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Members of my family died in the revolution,'' said Victor
Montelongo, an organizer for a PRI farmers' group in Guanajuato
state.
</P>
<P>
   Some sympathizers say they don't trust anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``The devil you know is better than the devil you don't,'' said
Rosa Espinoza, a secretary with the Mexican Confederation of
Workers, a massive pro-PRI union.
</P>
<P>
   And many support the party because it means perks in a poor
country.
</P>
<P>
   Government workers often receive housing subsidies, loans and
other benefits to offset low salaries. Poor people who seize land
to build houses on are incorporated into the PRI's ranks by local
party bosses, who help them obtain public services or tap into
electrical lines for free power.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of a great political culture of patronage,'' said
Jaime, the political analyst. ``The PRI hasn't been a military
dictatorship. It's been authoritarian but also inclusive.''
</P>
<P>
   As Mexico's political system has modernized in recent years and
opposition parties have begun to run more municipalities and
states, the PRI's patronage structure has begun to dissolve.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that doesn't mean it doesn't exist anymore,'' Jaime said.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida's final big rally in Mexico City on June 18 was packed
with people from PRI-affiliated groups, including unionized
teachers bused in from Jalisco, oil workers from Veracruz,
government workers all of stripes, and farmers and Indians from
Puebla and the state of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   A Zogby International poll of 1,330 likely voters surveyed
between June 10 and June 19 found Labastida had a 53-to-29-percent
advantage over Fox in rural areas, which are about 30 percent of
the electorate. The poll also found Labastida now has a three-point
lead over Fox, who, in a poll by the same company in May had a
five-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Many of Mexico's peasant farmers, who are on the lowest rungs of
the educational ladder, still regard the PRI and the government as
synonymous. They feel they owe the party their vote _ the PRI
distributed land after the revolution _ and they are grateful for
the few cash benefits the federal government gives them as
subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our grandparents voted for the PRI and so do we,'' said
Rosario Parra, 49, a Nahuatl Indian who was bused by the party from
rural Puebla to the PRI rally in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PRI has given us things like Procampo (cash subsidies for
farmers) and Progresa (a new program that offers cash for the
poorest of families),'' Parra added.
</P>
<P>
   A special watchdog congressional commission has filed at least
seven complaints with Mexico's Attorney General, charging that
evidence strongly suggests that the PRI is coercing votes using
these federal programs and turning some government workplaces into
virtual campaign headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Employees at the state-run oil company Pemex and a federal
family-welfare office, for example, have complained that managers
are under pressure to recruit votes for the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   Another PRI campaign practice _ passing out free gifts of food,
bags of cement and other goods _ is not necessarily illegal if
these goods are privately supplied. But charges are pouring in to
watchdog groups that state and local officials are supporting these
activities.
</P>
<P>
   The Labastida campaign is firing back, arguing that no charges
have been proved, and that Fox of trying to discredit the campaign
process because he could lose.
</P>
<P>
   At his Mexico City rally, Labastida said: ``Only those who
already sense defeat proclaim anticipated fraud, which only exists
in their imagination or because of their sense of desperation.''

   WASHINGTON _ The party that has governed Mexico for seven
decades has become as familiar to U.S. policymakers as the litany
of difficult issues dividing the giant neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   If the ruling party is tossed out in July 2 presidential
elections, though, American officials would quickly praise the
result as a healthy development in Mexico's democratic evolution, a
badly needed breath of fresh air for the rough-and-tumble politics
south of the border.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, though, turning the tables on 71 years of one-party
rule in Mexico would present new challenges to the United States,
even as it opened the door to a whole new chorus of long-stifled
political voner carrier of the long-ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party, known by its Spanish acronym, PRI; or
opposition candidate Vicente Fox Quesada, of the National Action
Party, or PAN.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mexican people will vote and make their own decision,''
President Clinton told reporters earlier this month, when Mexican
President Ernesto Zedillo (of the PRI) paid a visit to the White
House for his 11th bilateral meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, the answer is little different.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Labastida nor Fox has promised any significant departure
from policies that have led to increasingly close ties between the
United States and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   And U.S. diplomats and senior administration officials insist
that the bricks helped, said Leiken, author of the forthcoming
book, ``Melting Borders,'' a look at the Mexican community in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main impediment to change, in terms of corruption, is the
lack of alternacy in power _ the kind of immunity and impunity that
that has created among important political figures,'' he explained.
``When you have a one-party system, it lends itself to that.''
</P>
<P>
   A Fox victory wouldn't wipe out Mexican corruption, certainly,
nor would it run off the druglords.
</P>
<P>
   A government shake-up would, however, present a new
administration with the necessity to start with a clean slate. At a
minimum, that would force organized crime to dance the risky ballet
involved in courting contacts in a new government.
</P>
<P>
   That in itself could be a stride in the right direction for two
countries so dependent on each other in the drug war, as in so many
other endeavors.
</P>
<P>
   One thing's certain, said Goodman, no matter who wins on July 2:
``We really need them, and they really need us.''

   DAMASCUS, Syria _ Barely big enough for nine computers, Zoni
Internet Service offers Syrians an on-line window to the outside
world.
</P>
<P>
   A marker board lists cloaking sites, like ``besilent.com''.
Customers use them to get around firewalls to ``hotmail.com'' and
other mail systems blocked by the Syrian government's server.
</P>
<P>
   But, even more significant than the fact that Zoni gets away
with this, is that many other sites do not appear to be impeded by
the government at all.
</P>
<P>
   Customers can go to the Amnesty International homepage to read
up on torture in Syrian jails. They can get most newspapers and
news magazines on-line anywhere. They cannot get sites from Israel
but they can call up the Israeli Embassy Website in Washington,
D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Zoni is one of at least three non-government Internet shops
opening in the last nine months in Damascus. Tucked away on the
fourth floor of a dingy office building, it has the feel of
something slightly illicit but is brimming with optimism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here in Syria, many things will change,'' says 32-year-old
owner Yamor Alzoni, a bearded, practicing Muslim on the crest of
his country's Internet wave.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the Syrian government is for it or not _ and the signals
are mixed _ Internet use is slowly expanding in a country known for
slow change and controlled speech.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Syrian officials are showing a hesitancy typical of
authoritarian regimes confronted with a new technology. They don't
want to be left behind by the on-line world, but they seem intent
on trying to chaperone and manage their people's activity there.
</P>
<P>
   Syrians must have government licenses to get a password for
using the Internet. Officials say there are only about 7,000
Internet-licensed hook-up ``points,'' including those in schools or
other places with multiple users, for this country of more than 17
million.
</P>
<P>
   Saying the country's phone system has not been able to handle
more Internet users, officials limit the licenses to institutions
and the elite, like professors or business owners.
</P>
<P>
   Zoni's clients are largely foreigners checking E-mail messages.
The US$6.50-per-hour fees deter most Syrians. The country's per
capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 1998, the last year
available, was estimated at just US$2,500.
</P>
<P>
   Further slowing Internet use, there's a gray area for Syrians
hoping to get on-line from home.
</P>
<P>
   Saadalla Aghad Kalaa(cq all), head of the media committee for
the government-backed Syrian Computer Society, said the country is
not ready yet to plunge into unfettered home Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having the Internet at home is something that could hurt this
traditional society,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Syrians can use the Internet at home, he hesitates and
says in his precise English, ``It is not forbidden, but it is not
allowed.''
</P>
<P>
   Syria has begun loosening some controls on information.
Television satellite dishes were in effect legalized, albeit
slowly, in the mid-1990s. They sprout up by the thousands on
apartment-block rooftops in the city that claims to be the oldest
continually lived -in capital on earth.
</P>
<P>
   The computer society is headed by Bashar Assad, son of, and
likely successor to, the late Syrian President Hafez Assad. His
patronage has raised hopes that he will welcome the new computer
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Kalaa said the society and government have 200 computer training
centers around the country and expect to license more than 200,000
Internet hook-ups next year.
</P>
<P>
   But Syria is famous for restrictive, socialist-style planning.
</P>
<P>
   While other countries thrive off the freedom and spontaneity of
Internet use, Syria dribbles out the licenses. It tries to herd
users _ may of whom have computers at home _ into post offices,
schools or other centers where the Internet is available.
</P>
<P>
   Kalaa hosts a weekly television show that demonstrates the uses
of computers and the Internet. But, he says callers to the show
have a regular complaint: ``Why are you showing us this if we can't
use it at home?''
</P>
<P>
   Kalaa says it is a balancing act, trying to introduce the new
technology without angering older-generation Syrians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tell them, 'Even if you cannot use it, you must not stop
it,''' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Alzoni, the Internet shop owner, said government officials have
now denied him permission for a second branch. He believes it is
more out of the government's desire to control Internet monopolies
than any desire to restrict information.
</P>
<P>
   He notes that he's also been told that he cannot run an Internet
``cafe.'' Government departments keep a close eye on cafes and
coffee shops, places where people can gather and conspire. That
seemed to bother officials more than the new technology.
</P>
<P>
   So, Alzoni said, he called his business an Internet ``service''
and kept it open.

 &HT;    NEW PLAY EXAMINES THE TWO FACES OF NAZI ARCHITECT, SPEER
 &HT;    With Photos.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ How can an apparently honorable man take part in an
unspeakable evil and then find a way to live with himself?
</P>
<P>
   This is the central question of ``Albert Speer,'' a new play in
London that pursues its unsettling answers through a 3 1/2-hour
examination of the confessions and equivocations of Nazi leader
Adolph Hitler's pet architect and armaments minister.
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Trevor Nunn, the play is based on the successful
1995 biography by Gitta Sereny, ``Albert Speer: His Battle with
Truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Sereny, an Austrian-born Briton, wrote the 720-page book nearly
20 years after a three-week interview she had with Speer, who died
in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Because of his high position in the Nazi regime and his
willingness to write about his experiences, Speer long has been an
important figure in the effort to understand the inner workings of
the Third Reich.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the confessional and analytical nature of his books,
he has been widely regarded as ``the good Nazi.'' He maintained to
his death that he was unaware of the Holocaust until after the war.
</P>
<P>
   However, this assertion has come under attack in recent years by
Sereny and other writers who doubt that Speer could have been so
comfortably ignorant.
</P>
<P>
   This perspective is embraced by playwright David Edgar, best
known to Americans for his adaptation of Dickens' ``Nicholas
Nickleby'' in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Edgar explores the Speer story in two acts. The first represents
Speer's version, a portrayal that is faithful to his books,
``Inside the Third Reich'' and ``Spandau Diaries.''
</P>
<P>
   The scene opens with Speer's reporting to Spandau prison in
Berlin to begin the 20-year sentence handed down during the
Nuremberg trials. In the background of the scene are Nazi war
</P>
<P>
   criminals dangling by their necks _ a fate escaped by Speer.
</P>
<P>
   Despite an intelligent rendering of Speer by Alex Jennings, the
first act is stolen by Roger Allam's mesmerizing Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   Allam plays the Fuehrer as an intensely charming prophet with a
grand vision of a strong, pure Germany that will need _ and here's
where the young architect Speer comes in _ a spectacular new
capital on the magnitude of ancient Rome.
</P>
<P>
   Hitler comes across as an engaging, good listener with Old World
manners and a gift for flattery. He casts a Faustian spell over the
ambitious young Speer and elevates him to be the second most
powerful man in the Reich.
</P>
<P>
   At one point Speer tries to explain how Hitler's charismatic
appeal worked on intelligent, stable Germans _ such as Speer:
``Eighty million people didn't follow him because he was evil but
</P>
<P>
   because they thought he was extremely good!''
</P>
<P>
   In her book, Sereny describes an emotional even ``erotic''
relationship between the two men. Hitler saw the handsome young
Speer as the Aryan of his warped dreams. To Speer, Hitler was the
father-figure he never had. In the play, Speer's own father regards
his son's role in the Reich with icy contempt.
</P>
<P>
   This theme unfolds as a dark love story that only begins to
unravel in the horror of the last years of the war when Hitler's
loathsome insanity becomes obvious even to Speer.
</P>
<P>
   The moment of revelation comes during one of the play's most
memorable moments. Hitler _ now clearly disjointed and drained _
sits slumped against Speer's white model of the majestic dome that
he designed as centerpiece of the imperial Reich capital that never
was.
</P>
<P>
   Hitler rages at the cowards and inferiors who failed him in his
quest to rid the world of the ``Jewish-Bolshevik conspiracy.''
Speer, at last recognizing Hitler for what he was, bravely resists
the Fuehrer's final demand that he destroy Germany to deprive the
weaklings left behind with any means to recover from the war.
</P>
<P>
   Act 1 closes with a chilling 1943 speech made by Heinrich
Himmler, the Nazi SS leader who directed the program of mass
killing. Himmler reveals the full horror of the ``Final Solution.''
</P>
<P>
   The second act, which shows Speer after his release, shifts from
Speer's account of what happened and begins to chip away at his
story.
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of the play, Speer is portrayed not as sinner
seeking redemption but as a man seeking comfort in denial.
</P>
<P>
   Described by one character as a ``rent-a-penitent,'' Speer makes
the university and bookstore circuit dogged always by questions
about his role in the Reich. The questions in time overcome his
comfortable and practiced responses.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, he is forced to confront himself and the ghost of
Hitler in dreams that allow him no escape from his reality.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, he confesses that he must have known _ even though
he could never bring himself to acknowledge what had happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sensed, and turned away from what I sensed,'' Speer says
with horror.
</P>
<P>
   ``Albert Speer'' is scheduled to run through July 8. For
tickets, call 011-44-207-452-3000

   MERDORE BORDER CROSSING, Yugoslavia _ She called it the ``worst
torture.''
</P>
<P>
   Alma Berisha's 45-year-old husband, Renor, was rounded up and
jailed 14 months ago by Serb paramilitaries. For months she and her
family awaited word of his fate. They then paid thousands of
dollars in bribes for his freedom. And then they had to wait some
more.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't know the agony of not knowing if someone is alive or
dead,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   In the closing days of last year's 78-day NATO bombing campaign
against Yugoslavia, Serb military and paramilitary gangs wreaked a
final round of terror as they retreated, rounding up thousands of
Kosovar Albanians and throwing many of them in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Today, more than 1,100 ethnic Albanians, including old men,
women and teenagers under 18, remain in limbo in Serb jails, in
part because Western diplomats, rushing to finalize a cease-fire
agreement with the Serb-dominated Yugoslav government, deleted from
the document thorny provisions covering prisoner exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   While politicians defended this choice as politically expedient,
it has fostered a web of corruption within Serbia that charge
families between US$7,000 and US$15,000 to secure the release of
their relatives. In the last year, close to 1,000 Kosovar Albanians
have been freed from Serb jails, and Red Cross officials estimate
that 90 percent of those releases came after bribes paid by
families.
</P>
<P>
   The system, aid officials here say, is unjust, but they complain
that the strained political relationship between the international
community and Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic keeps their
hands tied in the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in the hands of Belgrade,'' Nic Sommers, spokesman for
the International Committee of the Red Cross in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   For the Berisha family, left with no political lifeline to help
free Renor, a former schoolteacher in his hometown of Djakova, in
western Kosovo, the choice was simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you speak of money or a life, there is no choice. You
pay,'' Alma Berisha said.
</P>
<P>
   After her husband's disappearance on May 13 last year, Alma
finally learned Renor was alive on Sept. 25. His name had been
published by the Red Cross, who gained access to many prisoners
after the war.
</P>
<P>
   The spunky 31-year-old with short curly, black hair, traveled to
the prison four times to visit Renor, reporting back to the family
that he was in good health and was treated humanely. But he had no
hope for release until February, when an Albanian lawyer named Ismi
Bytygi called the family.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer said he could make a deal with the Serbs to free
Renor. The cost: US$7,500.
</P>
<P>
   The Berishas scrounged together the cash, gave it to the lawyer.
And, for three more months, no word came.
</P>
<P>
   The tension during this time was unbearable, Alma recalled. Her
4-year-old son, Renlend, insisted his home set a plate at his dad's
place at the dinner table ``so we could feel nearer to him,'' she
said. But the empty place hung heavily on her.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the worst torture. This waiting time,'' Alma said
during an interview with Cox Newspapers last month at their family
home.
</P>
<P>
   Later that night, without any warning, the family received a
phone call they had been waiting for: 17 Albanians would be
released at the Merdore Border Crossing the next day, and Renor
would be among them.
</P>
<P>
   Quickly, the Berishas flew into motion. With less than 24 hours
to prepare, Alma was overcome with apprehension. She elected to
stay home with Renlend and other women in the family to prepare the
welcome home feast, while her brothers-in-law and her older son,
12-year-old Shefki, drove the four hours to the border to greet
Renor.
</P>
<P>
   When they reached Merdore in the early afternoon of May 30, a
crowd of about 100 people _ family members who also were waiting
for their relatives _ had already gathered.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere along the two-lane road felt like an airport when
an arriving plane is late. People attempted nervous small talk, not
daring to speak what each feared, that their husband, son or sister
would not appear.
</P>
<P>
   All of the 17 families said they paid to free their relatives.
None believed that the money was used for court fees or defense
investigations, but simply got passed along as bribes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who cares whose pockets I line or where it all ends up. What
is money, when you are talking about a human life?'' said one man
who paid US$10,000 to have his 21-year-old son released.
</P>
<P>
   As shadows lengthened across the grain fields dotted with red
poppies and the heat slipped from the late spring day, the tension
collapsed into wails of joy, like a clap of lightning followed by
raindrops.
</P>
<P>
   A three-vehicle convoy of white minibuses had been glimpsed down
the road across the stretch of no-man's land. Slowly, 15 men and
two women got out of the vehicles and walked single file under a
concrete railroad bridge and across the border to freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Renor came into view at the end of the line. He walked strongly,
with hands swinging, past Serb guards and into the arms of his
family.
</P>
<P>
   The Berishas smothered him in kisses, while he scooped his son
into his arms. Minutes later, the former schoolteacher, who looked
pale but otherwise healthy was still too overcome with emotion to
speak.
</P>
<P>
   The only member of the family who could find words through the
tears was Shefki, who wore a wide grin across his freckled face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I'm very happy. My dad has missed so much,'' the lanky
youngster said. ``He's not fat anymore. Now, I'll have to tease him
about something else.''

<P>
   A marker board lists cloaking sites, like ``besilent.com''.
Customers use them to get around firewalls to ``hotmail.com'' and
other mail systems blocked by the Syrian government's server.
</P>
<P>
   But, even more significant than the fact that Zoni gets away
with this, is that many other sites do not appear to be impeded by
the government at all.
</P>
<P>
   Customers can go to the Amnesty International homepage to read
up on torture in Syrian jails. They can get most newspapers and
news magazines on-line anywhere. They cannot get sites from Israel
but they can call up the Israeli Embassy Website in Washington,
D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Zoni is one of at least three non-government Internet shops
opening in the last nine months in Damascus. Tucked away on the
fourth floor of a dingy office building, it has the feel of
something slightly illicit but is brimming with optimism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here in Syria, many things will change,'' says 32-year-old
owner Yamor Alzoni, a bearded, practicing Muslim on the crest of
his country's Internet wave.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the Syrian government is for it or not _ and the signals
are mixed _ Internet use is slowly expanding in a country known for
slow change and controlled speech.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Syrian officials are showing a hesitancy typical of
authoritarian regimes confronted with a new technology. They don't
want to be left behind by the on-line world, but they seem intent
on trying to chaperone and manage their people's activity there.
</P>
<P>
   Syrians must have government licenses to get a password for
using the Internet. Officials say there are only about 7,000
Internet-licensed hook-up ``points,'' including those in schools or
other places with multiple users, for this country of more than 17
million.
</P>
<P>
   Saying the country's phone system has not been able to handle
more Internet users, officials limit the licenses to institutions
and the elite, like professors or business owners.
</P>
<P>
   Zoni's clients are largely foreigners checking E-mail messages.
The US$6.50-per-hour fees deter most Syrians. The country's per
capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 1998, the last year
available, was estimated at just US$2,500.
</P>
<P>
   Further slowing Internet use, there's a gray area for Syrians
hoping to get on-line from home.
</P>
<P>
   Saadalla Aghad Kalaa(cq all), head of the media committee for
the government-backed Syrian Computer Society, said the country is
not ready yet to plunge into unfettered home Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having the Internet at home is something that could hurt this
traditional society,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Syrians can use the Internet at home, he hesitates and
says in his precise English, ``It is not forbidden, but it is not
allowed.''
</P>
<P>
   Syria has begun loosening some controls on information.
Television satellite dishes were in effect legalized, albeit
slowly, in the mid-1990s. They sprout up by the thousands on
apartment-block rooftops in the city that claims to be the oldest
continually lived -in capital on earth.
</P>
<P>
   The computer society is headed by Bashar Assad, son of, and
likely successor to, the late Syrian President Hafez Assad. His
patronage has raised hopes that he will welcome the new computer
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Kalaa said the society and government have 200 computer training
centers around the country and expect to license more than 200,000
Internet hook-ups next year.
</P>
<P>
   But Syria is famous for restrictive, socialist-style planning.
</P>
<P>
   While other countries thrive off the freedom and spontaneity of
Internet use, Syria dribbles out the licenses. It tries to herd
users _ may of whom have computers at home _ into post offices,
schools or other centers where the Internet is available.
</P>
<P>
   Kalaa hosts a weekly television show that demonstrates the uses
of computers and the Internet. But, he says callers to the show
have a regular complaint: ``Why are you showing us this if we can't
use it at home?''
</P>
<P>
   Kalaa says it is a balancing act, trying to introduce the new
technology without angering older-generation Syrians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tell them, 'Even if you cannot use it, you must not stop
it,''' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Alzoni, the Internet shop owner, said government officials have
now denied him permission for a second branch. He believes it is
more out of the government's desire to control Internet monopolies
than any desire to restrict information.
</P>
<P>
   He notes that he's also been told that he cannot run an Internet
``cafe.'' Government departments keep a close eye on cafes and
coffee shops, places where people can gather and conspire. That
seemed to bother officials more than the new technology.
</P>
<P>
   So, Alzoni said, he called his business an Internet ``service''
and kept it open.

   SEOUL _ When Christopher McCarthy, a 22-year-old American
soldier, escaped from U.S. military custody after he was accused of
murdering a South Korean bar hostess for refusing sex with him, it
fed the belief among South Koreans that Americans believe they're
above the law.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy was apprehended eight hours later and was sentenced by
a South Korean court this month to eight years in prison. However,
that incident was the latest in a series of events, including the
surprisingly successful summit between North and South Korea, that
has stoked calls for less interference from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's a very strong anti-American sentiment
right now, but I think it's growing,'' said Jung-Hoon Lee,
professor of international relations at Yonsei University in Seoul.
``The summit contributed to it because of its focus on independence
and autonomy.''
</P>
<P>
   Reunification of the two Koreas is seen by some South Koreans as
an issue that can be resolved by Koreans only.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Kim Jong Il's new look ... (showing) he can be friendly,
smile, be jovial, a very confident leader, (some people) feel, we
can do some business with this guy and Americans only serve as a
possible roadblock,'' said Lee. ``So that sort of feeds on
anti-American sentiment that was already there. There's a sense
that we should do this alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there have always been factions in Korea _ especially
among the left-wing and the younger generations - who believe U.S.
troops should go home.
</P>
<P>
   Massive student demonstrations in the 1970s and '80s are
characterized as anti-American but were more directed at the
military dictators who ruled South Korea, said Lee. But because of
the military alliance between the two countries, the United States
was seen as tolerating or approving of the dictatorships, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many students still feel Korea is being used by Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States thinks of Korea as their colony,'' said Soo
Jin Park, a 25-year-old student at Yonsei University. ``Not on
paper, but by the way they act, Koreans get that impression.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the 37,000 American troops in Korea should leave
``because we're not at war and I see no reason for them to stay in
Korea.''
</P>
<P>
   While such sentiments are common on university campuses,
analysts agree they do not represent the mainstream view in Korea.
</P>
<P>
   However, there is a growing belief _ even among people who would
identify themselves as pro-American and have no desire to see
American troops withdraw _ that Washington needs to treat Korea as
more of an equal.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some sense, I must say Korea is controlled by the United
States in many ways,'' said Rev. Young Joon Cho, pastor of Chung
Dong First Methodist Church in Seoul.
</P>
<P>
   Pagoda Park in downtown Seoul is filled with elderly men playing
chess, practicing calligraphy or just passing the time. In one
corner, a retired sociology teacher who would give his name only as
Mr. Kim is holding court with an audience of at least a couple
dozen, lecturing on U.S.-Korean relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States shouldn't look down at Korea,'' he said.
``We're not the Korea of 50 years ago. They should respect Korea as
a full sovereign country and let us solve our own problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the Foreign Ministry believes it is ready for an adjustment
in the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, our relationship has been one of dependence on
U.S. aid,'' said Sung-Hwan Kim, deputy director of the Ministry's
North American bureau. ``Now I feel we're equipped with the
requirements (for a more equal partnership).''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. recognizes that the relationship is an evolving one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Korea has changed from the poorest country in the world in the
fifties and sixties to one of the richest,'' said a U.S. official
based in Korea who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``There's a
constant need to re-evaluate the relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the displeasure towards Americans stems from the Status
of Forces Agreement, which in part governs how U.S. soldiers who
commit crimes or wrongdoings in Korea are handled. From little
things, like not paying traffic tickets, to violent crimes, such as
murder, Koreans feel Americans get away with too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``When (American soldiers) are outside of their campus, they are
not restricted by Korean law, and that's not right,'' said Byung
Chan Son, who owns a small energy consulting firm in Seoul.
``Korean people are very unhappy.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the agreement is currently being renegotiated, as it
periodically is. Kim of the Foreign Ministry said Korea has
proposed several changes, such as requiring indicted American
soldiers to remain in Korean custody instead of American military
custody and requiring American military facilities _ where air and
ground pollution are not subject to regulations _ to adhere to
basic environmental guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the United States must make an effort to ... give the
Korean public at least an appearance that it respects Korea, treats
Korea as an equal partner and that there's a balance in the
bilateral relations,'' said Lee.

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Alfredo Mondragon is from a Mexico so far removed
from modern times, he doesn't know his age and he can't express why
he supports this country's Institutional Revolutionary Party _ the
PRI.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just what we do,'' the Mazahua Indian from rural Mexico
state said. He stood motionless in soiled work clothes among a
throng of 100,000 cheering for the party's presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   High school teacher and union member Flavio Bernal, on the other
hand, has no trouble defending his party with a militant's
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Mexico we live with social peace that the PRI has
guaranteed,'' the 31-year-old Guadalajara resident said, pumping
his fist. ``We know the party has made mistakes, but we don't give
up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Indian peasant and the earnest teacher _ both bused to
Mexico City for a recent rally _ are just two faces of a vast quilt
of support that helps sustain the PRI, the world's longest ruling
political party. For 71 years the PRI (pronounced, ``Pree'') has
controlled this country's presidency and most other political
offices.
</P>
<P>
   But the PRI faces its toughest test ever when Mexicans elect
their next president on July 2. Its candidate, veteran government
economist Francisco Labastida Ochoa, is locked in a bitter fight to
the end with Vicente Fox Quesada, a former Coca-Cola executive and
rancher who has mounted the most effective opposition campaign in
Mexico's modern history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since I entered politics in 1988, my mission has been to
drive the PRI from Los Pinos (the Mexican White House),'' said Fox,
candidate of the conservative National Action Party and coalition
Alliance for Change. ``Mexico can't live with the PRI anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   After seven decades in power _ and half the population in
poverty _ the PRI has a lot of incumbent baggage to carry. If it
loses the election, most political analysts agree, the party would
slide into crisis and jettison its national leadership. But don't
expect it to die.
</P>
<P>
   ``That party has a structure and breadth nobody is going to give
up,'' said Mexico City analyst Joel Estudillo.
</P>
<P>
   The party's boosters argue that while Mexico may be riddled with
problems, the party rose from ashes of the 1910 Mexican Revolution
and managed to turn a feudal backwater into an industrial,
oil-producing nation. The party's enemies, however, say the PRI has
perpetuated corruption and enriched an elite. They blame the party
for forcing millions of Mexico's poor to emigrate to the United
States, and plunging the country into repeated economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Among its detractors, the PRI is often scornfully referred to as
``the system'' or ``the official party'' or simply, ``the
dinosaur.''
</P>
<P>
   Its core support, some analysts say, is now only about 30
percent to 35 percent of Mexico's 58.7 million voters. But a
well-known leftist candidate, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, is also running
for the presidency, so the opposition vote is split, which helps
Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of this divided opposition vote, most opinion polls
show that Fox and Labastida are in a dead heat now among likely
voters. Fox is trying to syphon votes from Cardenas and both are
fighting for the undecided, which could be as much as 20 percent of
the electorate.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI has enormous advantages in this war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now the party is pointing a shotgun and firing
everywhere,'' said Mexico City political analyst Edna Jaime. ``It's
using everything possible to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The PRI has sought to project a ``new PRI,'' more democratic and
more willing to engage in fierce but fair competition with rivals.
</P>
<P>
   For this election, the PRI hired cutting-edge U.S. campaign
strategists, like James Carville, President Clinton's advisor, to
help poll voters and fashion messages. The Austin, Texas-based
Public Strategies Inc., which shapes communications for campaigns,
has assisted in developing international relations.
</P>
<P>
   But in April, when it appeared that Fox was dramatically gaining
ground, the party also called in some controversial old-fashioned
party leaders to join the cause. At least one advisor, Manuel
Bartlett, has a reputation for strong-arm tactics. It's never been
proved, but many Mexicans even think he engineered outright fraud
in the 1988 presidential race to give the PRI the victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``To win an election you have to be inclusive,'' said Javier
Trevino, a Harvard University-educated international affairs
advisor to Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign needs everyone in the party on board to help,
Trevino said, and election rules are so tight today nobody can
commit fraud at the ballot box.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the election we are going to continue to transform the
PRI,'' he added. ``But first we have an objective, which is to win
the election.''
</P>
<P>
   A key part of that strategy remains the PRI's traditional
network of ``corporatist'' organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Over seven decades, the PRI has built a web of pro-party unions
and associations that incorporate farmers, oil workers, industrial
workers, industrialists and government employees into the party's
ranks.
</P>
<P>
   True believers say they support the party because of its rebel
roots and flexible, mixed ideology, borrowing from socialism and
capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Members of my family died in the revolution,'' said Victor
Montelongo, an organizer for a PRI farmers' group in Guanajuato
state.
</P>
<P>
   Some sympathizers say they don't trust anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``The devil you know is better than the devil you don't,'' said
Rosa Espinoza, a secretary with the Mexican Confederation of
Workers, a massive pro-PRI union.
</P>
<P>
   And many support the party because it means perks in a poor
country.
</P>
<P>
   Government workers often receive housing subsidies, loans and
other benefits to offset low salaries. Poor people who seize land
to build houses on are incorporated into the PRI's ranks by local
party bosses, who help them obtain public services or tap into
electrical lines for free power.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of a great political culture of patronage,'' said
Jaime, the political analyst. ``The PRI hasn't been a military
dictatorship. It's been authoritarian but also inclusive.''
</P>
<P>
   As Mexico's political system has modernized in recent years and
opposition parties have begun to run more municipalities and
states, the PRI's patronage structure has begun to dissolve.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that doesn't mean it doesn't exist anymore,'' Jaime said.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida's final big rally in Mexico City on June 18 was packed
with people from PRI-affiliated groups, including unionized
teachers bused in from Jalisco, oil workers from Veracruz,
government workers all of stripes, and farmers and Indians from
Puebla and the state of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   A Zogby International poll of 1,330 likely voters surveyed
between June 10 and June 19 found Labastida had a 53-to-29-percent
advantage over Fox in rural areas, which are about 30 percent of
the electorate. The poll also found Labastida now has a three-point
lead over Fox, who, in a poll by the same company in May had a
five-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Many of Mexico's peasant farmers, who are on the lowest rungs of
the educational ladder, still regard the PRI and the government as
synonymous. They feel they owe the party their vote _ the PRI
distributed land after the revolution _ and they are grateful for
the few cash benefits the federal government gives them as
subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our grandparents voted for the PRI and so do we,'' said
Rosario Parra, 49, a Nahuatl Indian who was bused by the party from
rural Puebla to the PRI rally in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PRI has given us things like Procampo (cash subsidies for
farmers) and Progresa (a new program that offers cash for the
poorest of families),'' Parra added.
</P>
<P>
   A special watchdog congressional commission has cess because he
could lose.
</P>
<P>
   At his Mexico City rally, Labastida said: ``Only those who
already sense defeat proclaim anticipated fraud, which only exists
in their imagination or because of their sense of desperation.''

   U.S. WATCHING MEXICAN ELECTION CLOSELY, EXPECTS LITTLE CHANGE IN
RELATIONSHIP And, with Americans and Mexicans making 300 million
legal border crossings each year, not to mention illegal smuggling
and immigration, it's getting harder all the time to distinguish
between Mexican problems and American ills.
</P>
<P>
   Against that backdrop of growing integration between two very
different countries that just happen to be neighbors, Mexico
analysts in this country have long regarded Mexico's one-party rule
as a mixed blessing.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, it's brought stability _ of a sort _ to a
country with which the United States shares a 2,000-mile-long
border.
</P>
<P>
   That's no small achievement, given the vast disparities between
the two countries, the pernicious influence of druglords in Mexico
and the history of political violence and repression across much of
Central America and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   And the PRI has provided a known entity to U.S. policymakers.
They'd had years to get to know Zedillo. A Yale-trained economist,
Zedillo had held two cabinet positions under Mexico's former PRI
leader, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, by the time Zedillo
took office in December 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's political predictability, though, has come at a price,
beginning, said Goodman, with a lack of imagination and energy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you just have one set of decision-makers, you end up in
paralysis,'' said Goodman, dean of international studies at
American University in Washington. ``That's been a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The impact has gone far beyond questions of good governance.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Zedillo's efforts to root out corruption and bear down
on drug kingpins, Mexico has made little headway against violent
and well-funded druglords.
</P>
<P>
   ``It (the Mexican government) has not disrupted the activities
of the major drug cartels,'' the State Department reported three
months ago in its annual review of international counter-drug
efforts. ``Chronic problems of corruption, weak police and criminal
justice institutions, budget constraints and severe poverty in
rural areas where drug crops are cultivated hamper Mexico's ability
to combat drug trafficking effectively.''
</P>
<P>
   One-party rule hasn't helped, said Leiken, author of the
forthcoming book, ``Melting Borders,'' a look at the Mexican
community in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main impediment to change, in terms of corruption, is the
lack of alternacy in power _ the kind of immunity and impunity that
that has created among important political figures,'' he explained.
``When you have a one-party system, it lends itself to that.''
</P>
<P>
   A Fox victory wouldn't wipe out Mexican corruption, certainly,
nor would it run off the druglords.
</P>
<P>
   A government shake-up would, however, present a new
administration with the necessity to start with a clean slate. At a
minimum, that would force organized crime to dance the risky ballet
involved in courting contacts in a new government.
</P>
<P>
   That in itself could be a stride in the right direction for two
countries so dependent on each other in the drug war, as in so many
other endeavors.
</P>
<P>
   One thing's certain, said Goodman, no matter who wins on July 2:
``We really need them, and they really need us.''

   SEOUL _ Wearing a crisply-pressed suit, a cellular phone at his
side, Son Byung Chan paused last week from the life he's built as a
successful consultant in this hard-driving capital and cast his
memory back half a century.
</P>
<P>
   The rice grew tall in the broad muddy paddies on the outskirts
of Pusan that June, and Son, then just seven years old, raced
barefoot with friends down dusty roads.
</P>
<P>
   The joys of summer, though, were soon swept aside.
</P>
<P>
   In the pre-dawn hours of June 25, 1950, nearly 100,000 North
Korean troops, backed by Russian built T-34 tanks and rolling
artillery, stormed across the border that had divided Korea since
the closing days of World War II into the Soviet-controlled North
and the U.S.-backed South.
</P>
<P>
   The attack opened three years of war that devastated Korea, left
more than 3 million dead, set the Cold War in stone and fired the
ideological animosities between East and West that, across the
Korean divide at least, have yet to be fully extinguished.
</P>
<P>
   The tides of history and the ravages of war unfolded before
young Son in startling glimpses of shattered lives.
</P>
<P>
   The bleeding bodies of wounded soldiers stretched out across the
classrooms of his elementary school. The fevered voices of refugees
huddled each night in the upper floor of his family's small wooden
home. The sweet and foreign taste of his first chocolate bar, the
gift of an American soldier a long way from home.
</P>
<P>
   From those uncertain beginnings, Son forged a life that has
taken him from adversity to prosperity, in a remarkable journey
that has paralleled his country's own epic rise from the ashes of
war to its position today as the thriving democratic home to the
world's 11th-largest economy.
</P>
<P>
   For Son, as for the nation, the transformation has played itself
out in the shadow of South Korea's giant ally, the United States,
whose presence on the craggy peninsula has become as much a part of
the country's psychic landscape as green rice stalks shimmering in
the summer sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``American soldiers have been staying in Korea for so long,''
Son said, ``if Americans moved out, for some time I'd feel
something odd, something missing.''
</P>
<P>
   Fifty years after the Korean War, some 37,000 American troops
stand sentry still on the divided Peninsula, where 54,000 U.S.
servicemen lost their lives fighting to push back North Korean
troops and their Chinese comrades in arms.
</P>
<P>
   For its sacrifice, the United States gained a staunch and
reliable ally in Asia's volatile northeast corner, even as it built
a citadel of capitalist-fed democracy on the frontiers of global
communism. Wedged between the eastern rim of China and Russia,
South Korea stood for four decades on the front lines of the Cold
War.
</P>
<P>
   From U.S. bases in South Korea, American warplanes armed with
nuclear bombs were, until the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union,
poised on alert around the clock. Pilots suited up and waited in
their cockpits for orders _ that never came _ to attack Russian
naval and submarine forces in Vladivostok, less than an hour's
flight away for an F-16.
</P>
<P>
   Supersonic spy planes took off from South Korea to overfly
Soviet positions, and U.S. soldiers and Marines trained in
large-scale war games across the width and breadth of South Korea,
while American Air Force and Navy pilots flew mock bombing runs and
waged practice dog fights in the skies overhead.
</P>
<P>
   None of that, and none that followed, would have been possible,
however, if the U.S.-led United Nations forces hadn't turned back
North Korea in a conflict that marked a turning point in Western
efforts to stem the advance of communism at its geo-strategic
zenith.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stopped North Korea and, at that time, it's ally China, and
its founder and supporter, Russia, from taking all of the Korean
Peninsula,'' said retired U.S. Army Col. William Taylor, a senior
adviser for international security affairs at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   That was anything but a foregone conclusion in the opening weeks
of the Korean War, when North Koreans rolled over the lightly-armed
South Korean forces, pressing fleeing civilians and retreating
troops to the fringes of Pusan on the peninsula's southern tip.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. forces led a larger United Nations contingent in a
three-year war to push back North Korean forces and their Chinese
allies.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting ended July 27, 1953, with a cease-fire _ though no
formal peace treaty has ever been signed _ along frontlines roughly
the same as the border that divided the two Koreas before the war.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 1 million Chinese soldiers are estimated to have been
killed in the fighting, along with half a million North Koreans,
nearly 300,000 South Koreans and up to 2 million Korean civilians
on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the country was left in cinders, its cities leveled to
rubble, its countryside almost completely denuded by fighting and
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The country was so empty, `` said Rev. Cho Young Joon, pastor
of Chung Dong First Methodist Church in Seoul. He remembers
boarding a plane in 1960 to fly to the United States and seeing his
war-torn country from above for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nothing much remaining,'' Cho recalled last week, in
an interview with Cox Newspapers. ``Just red dirt.''
</P>
<P>
   In lieu of a peace treaty, each side threw up massive defenses
along the 140-mile-long border dividing Korea into North and South.
</P>
<P>
   Even today, in the wake of this month's historic summit in
Pyongyang between South Korean President Kim Dae Jung and North
Korean leader Kim Jong Il, the badly misnamed demilitarized zone,
or DMZ, remains the most heavily defended place on earth.
</P>
<P>
   The final faultline in a Cold War otherwise consigned to
history, the DMZ is a landmine-ridden, barbed-wire bounded swath
less than 5,000 yards wide. North Korea has nearly 1 million combat
troops arrayed near the DMZ, faced off against several hundred
thousand South Korean and American forces just across the verdant
no-man's line dividing the two.
</P>
<P>
   In few places are the stakes as high.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tensions on the Korean Peninsula remain the leading threat to
peace and stability in East Asia,'' states the most recent White
House national security annual review.
</P>
<P>
   Combining military deterrence with diplomacy, the United States
has been fundamental to South Korea's stunning post-war
development.
</P>
<P>
   In two generations, per capita income has risen from US$50 a
year to nearly US$10,000. The the country's economic output rose
last year to US$407 billion; it's on track to add nearly US$30
billion more to that amount this year.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea has become a leading U.S. trading partner as well.
Two-way commerce last year hit US$54 billion, roughly 2.5 percent
of total U.S. imports and exports.
</P>
<P>
   Credit for the gains belongs largely to the Confucian work ethic
in a country where the 14-hour day and the six-day work week are
accepted as something of an article of faith.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. alliance, though, has been critical in providing a
security backdrop, as well as billions of dollars in assistance.
Direct U.S. aid ended in the early 1980s, but the United States put
up more than US$10 billion four years ago as its share of the US$57
billion international aid package put together to rescue the
flagging South Korean economy in the wake of a currency and stock
market crisis.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea has recovered smartly, though not, in all areas, to
pre-crisis levels.
</P>
<P>
   During their summit earlier this month, the leaders of North and
South Korea pledged to expand cultural ties, work toward reuniting
some of the tens of thousands of families that were divided by the
Korean War, and try to set relations on a cooperative footing.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton followed by implementing a policy he first
declared last September, saying he would rescind key parts of the
trade embargo President Harry Truman placed on North Korea when it
attacked the South 50 years ago. Within days Atlanta-based
Coca-Cola Co. began selling its soft drinks in the North, and U.S.
airlines, shipping companies, exporters, importers and banks are
expected to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen whether a charm offensive, from both sides
of the DMZ, can melt away half a century of hostility and set the
stage for peaceful reunification of a culture that was already
4,000 years old, after all, before the shooting began.
</P>
<P>
   Many appear willing, though, to at least give peace the benefit
of the doubt. The fervent anti-communist rhetoric of past war
commemorations has been tempered by renewed hopes for peace and
possible reunification.
</P>
<P>
   In hopes of pressing the momentum for peace, South Korea has
scrubbed plans for large-scale battle re-enactments and a huge
parade featuring South Korean war veterans that had been scheduled
for Sunday in downtown Seoul.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, after the summit, the atmosphere is totally changed
here,'' said Kim Sung-Hwan, deputy director-general for the Foreign
Ministry's North American bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is likely to sound a hopeful note, as well, when he
speaks Sunday to more than 10,000 American veterans of the Korean
War expected to descend upon the national memorial to those who
served there, in the shadow of the Lincoln Memorial.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything, though, Clinton will pay homage to those
Americans who gave the supreme sacrifice to help turn back
communist aggression on the Korean peninsula. It's a salute, said
Taylor, that's well-deserved.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stopped the first major communist military offensive in the
post World War II world,'' said Taylor, who served in Korea in
1961. ``In the process, we have provided, since 1953, the backdrop
for the development and growth of a country that today is a
thriving democracy and a South Korea that has long been called an
economic miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   For Americans, he added, ``It has been a fair bargain.''

their cockpits for orders _ that never came _ to attack Russian
naval and submarine forces in Vladivostok, less than an hour's
flight away for an F-16.
</P>
<P>
   Supersonic spy planes took off from South Korea to overfly
Soviet positions, and U.S. soldiers and Marines trained in
large-scale war games across the width and breadth of South Korea,
while American Air Force and Navy pilots flew mock bombing runs and
waged practice dog fights in the skies overhead.
</P>
<P>
   None of that, and none that followed, would have been possible,
however, if the U.S.-led United Nations forces hadn't turned back
North Korea in a conflict that marked a turning point in Western
efforts to stem the advance of communism at its geo-strategic
zenith.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stopped North Korea and, at that time, it's ally China, and
its founder and supporter, Russia, from taking all of the Korean
Peninsula,'' said retired U.S. Army Col. William Taylor, a senior
adviser for international security affairs at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   That was anything but a foregone conclusion in the opening weeks
of the Korean War, when North Koreans rolled over the lightly-armed
South Korean forces, pressing fleeing civilians and retreating
troops to the fringes of Pusan on the peninsula's southern tip.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. forces led a larger United Nations contingent in a
three-year war to push back North Korean forces and their Chinese
allies.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting ended July 27, 1953, with a cease-fire _ though no
formal peace treaty has ever been signed _ along frontlines roughly
the same as the border that divided the two Koreas before the war.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 1 million Chinese soldiers are estimated to have been
killed in the fighting, along with half a million North Koreans,
nearly 300,000 South Koreans and up to 2 million Korean civilians
on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the country was left in cinders, its cities leveled to
rubble, its countryside almost completely denuded by fighting and
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The country was so empty, `` said Rev. Cho Young Joon, pastor
of Chung Dong First Methodist Church in Seoul. He remembers
boarding a plane in 1960 to fly to the United States and seeing his
war-torn country from above for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nothing much remaining,'' Cho recalled last week, in
an interview with Cox Newspapers. ``Just red dirt.''
</P>
<P>
   In lieu of a peace treaty, each side threw up massive defenses
along the 140-mile-long border dividing Korea into North and South.
</P>
<P>
   Even today, in the wake of this month's historic summit in
Pyongyang between South Korean President Kim Dae Jung and North
Korean leader Kim Jong Il, the badly misnamed demilitarized zone,
or DMZ, remains the most heavily defended place on earth.
</P>
<P>
   The final faultline in a Cold War otherwise consigned to
history, the DMZ is a landmine-ridden, barbed-wire bounded swath
less than 5,000 yards wide. North Korea has nearly 1 million combat
troops arrayed near the DMZ, faced off against several hundred
thousand South Korean and American forces just across the verdant
no-man's line dividing the two.
</P>
<P>
   In few places are the stakes as high.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tensions on the Korean Peninsula remain the leading threat to
peace and stability in East Asia,'' states the most recent White
House national security annual review.
</P>
<P>
   Combining military deterrence with diplomacy, the United States
has been fundamental to South Korea's stunning post-war
development.
</P>
<P>
   In two generations, per capita income has risen from US$50 a
year to nearly US$10,000. The the country's economic output rose
last year to US$407 billion; it's on track to add nearly US$30
billion more to that amount this year.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea has become a leading U.S. trading partner as well.
Two-way commerce last year hit US$54 billion, roughly 2.5 percent
of total U.S. imports and exports.
</P>
<P>
   Credit for the gains belongs largely to the Confucian work ethic
in a country where the 14-hour day and the six-day work week are
accepted as something of an article of faith.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. alliance, though, has been critical in providing a
security backdrop, as well as billions of dollars in assistance.
Direct U.S. aid ended in the early 1980s, but the United States put
up more than US$10 billion four years ago as its share of the US$57
billion international aid package put together to rescue the
flagging South Korean economy in the wake of a currency and stock
market crisis.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea has recovered smartly, though not, in all areas, to
pre-crisis levels.
</P>
<P>
   During their summit earlier this month, the leaders of North and
South Korea pledged to expand cultural ties, work toward reuniting
some of the tens of thousands of families that were divided by the
Korean War, and try to set relations on a cooperative footing.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton followed by implementing a policy he first
declared last September, saying he would rescind key parts of the
trade embargo President Harry Truman placed on North Korea when it
attacked the South 50 years ago. Within days Atlanta-based
Coca-Cola Co. began selling its soft drinks in the North, and U.S.
airlines, shipping companies, exporters, importers and banks are
expected to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen whether a charm offensive, from both sides
of the DMZ, can melt away half a century of hostility and set the
stage for peaceful reunification of a culture that was already
4,000 years old, after all, before the shooting began.
</P>
<P>
   Many appear willing, though, to at least give peace the benefit
of the doubt. The fervent anti-communist rhetoric of past war
commemorations has been tempered by renewed hopes for peace and
possible reunification.
</P>
<P>
   In hopes of pressing the momentum for peace, South Korea has
scrubbed plans for large-scale battle re-enactments and a huge
parade featuring South Korean war veterans that had been scheduled
for Sunday in downtown Seoul.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, after the summit, the atmosphere is totally changed
here,'' said Kim Sung-Hwan, deputy director-general for the Foreign
Ministry's North American bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is likely to sound a hopeful note, as well, when he
speaks Sunday to more than 10,000 American veterans of the Korean
War expected to descend upon the national memorial to those who
served there, in the shadow of the Lincoln Memorial.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything, though, Clinton will pay homage to those
Americans who gave the supreme sacrifice to help turn back
communist aggression on the Korean peninsula. It's a salute, said
Taylor, that's well-deserved.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stopped the first major communist military offensive in the
post World War II world,'' said Taylor, who served in Korea in
1961. ``In the process, we have provided, since 1953, the backdrop
for the development and growth of a country that today is a
thriving democracy and a South Korea that has long been called an
economic miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   For Americans, he added, ``It has been a fair bargain.''

 &HT;    Surviving takes skills in real life
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Perhaps the most pointed critique of the
``Survivor'' phenomenon comes from none other than the real-life
Gilligan: ``I wouldn't go on that island even for a million
dollars,'' said Bob Denver, from the safety of his West Virginia
home. ``I don't eat rats.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor, apparently, does he like to associate with them.
</P>
<P>
   What's so appalling about ``Survivor'' is not the
much-ballyhooed complaint that we have become a nation of voyeurs _
hey, it's not as if we're spying on anybody's actual lives here _
but its mean-spiritedness. In an unholy marriage of ``Deliverance''
and junior high school, competitors are encouraged to work as a
team _ and, if they fail, to ``vote'' each other out of their
lives.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, CBS camera crews coax contestants to bad-mouth
each other behind their backs: ``I don't think Ramona is pulling
her weight;'' ``I'm going to vote Stacey off because I don't like
her and I never will.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Farley, past president of the American Psychological
Association made a dead-on observation when he told USA Today:
``This is intentional public humiliation. They drum you out,
blackmail people. It is so destructive, so negative. After
thousands of years of great ideas, of thinking we are rising up
from a primitive past to a higher place, then we get this.''
</P>
<P>
   I asked one of our most well-mannered Daytonians, Betty Darst,
what she thought of the show. ``Sounds as though we are going back
to the days of the Roman Coliseum,'' said the Beavercreek woman.
</P>
<P>
   Well-known locally for her portrayals of the Wright brothers'
sister, Katharine, and Greene County pioneer Becky Galloway, Darst
spends a lot of time, figuratively speaking, in an era of more
refined manners: ``These people had courage and leadership and
talent for nurturing other people.''
</P>
<P>
   Becky Galloway's father used to say: ``You can judge what's
important to a person by what they bring over by covered wagon,''
Darst said. ``In the Galloways' case it was more than 750 books.''
</P>
<P>
   What does ``Survivor'' say about what we value _ and don't value
_ in our society?
</P>
<P>
   No, the problem isn't voyeurism, despite this week's Time
magazine cover story, ``Voyeur TV: We Like to Watch,'' complete
with a fetching photo of a contestant in her pink bikini. These
are, after all, artificial situations set up to be spied on. I
suspect CBS would consider it downright rude if we didn't.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is the winner-versus-loser mentality that permeates
every frame. The notion that we can best ``survive'' without each
other.
</P>
<P>
   Who wouldn't, on any given day, ``vote'' someone out of our
lives?
</P>
<P>
   The boss makes you late for your anger-management session? Cast
her away.
</P>
<P>
   The 4-year-old refuses to put his shoes on during the frantic
morning rush hour, when tempers snap like toothpicks? Kick him out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Survivor'' offers the Jerry Springer solution to all that ails
us _ just humiliate those closest to you. Cut them out of the will.
Cut them out of your life. And cut them down while you're at it.
</P>
<P>
   Real life, of course, works just the opposite. With time and
trials, we vote ourselves off our private island of
self-absorption. We evolve from the social hierarchy of junior high
school and develop the skills we truly need to survive in the adult
world: Compromise. Teamwork. Compassion.
</P>
<P>
   All of which seem in scant supply on Pulau Tiga. The Survivors,
many of them, seem trapped in that worst of all tropical hells:
adolescence.
</P>
<P>
   I'll cast my lot with Gilligan: The best hope for us castaways
is to stick together.

 &HT;    Risk is no surprise to sportswriters
 &HT;    By Jim Minter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAYETTEVILLE, Ga. _ Pardon me, but I can't get all worked up
over John Rocker's confrontation with the Sports Illustrated writer
in Turner Field. Having been a sportswriter in an earlier life, I
thought those things came with the territory.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Van Brocklin was the Atlanta Falcons coach newspaper
writer Furman Bisher deftly introduced to Atlanta as ``Hitler with
a hangover.'' The Dutchman, more mildly described as ``volatile,''
once interrupted dinner by grabbing the Atlanta Journal's Frank
Hyland by the throat in an attempt to strangle him for something he
had written. On another occasion he challenged Ron Hudspeth to
``stack chairs'' and duke it out in barroom fashion.
</P>
<P>
   When I was covering the Falcons, Van Brocklin and I had several
stimulating conversations in the bowels of old Atlanta Stadium.
There were no witnesses, but I wouldn't have minded five or six. I
was impressed by the story about him strolling down Seventh Avenue
in New York and pausing to stuff NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle into
a trash can.
</P>
<P>
   Professional athletes usually are big, strong and aggressive. If
you don't get it fairly right and reasonably fair there is a
possibility of bodily harm. That's why sportswriters, like
paratroopers and jet pilots, often get paid more than reporters who
cover the symphony.
</P>
<P>
   Every newspaper reporter or editor should be required to serve a
tour on a sports beat. The definition of editorial writers as
people who ride down into the valley after the battle and shoot the
wounded isn't all wrong. It's one thing to sit in a newspaper
office, several floors up, firing bazookas out the window at
targets as far away as Washington. It's something else to go
face-to-face in stadium tunnels with big, strong and aggressive
subjects who generally are neither Phi Beta Kappas nor candidates
for diplomatic postings.
</P>
<P>
   I'm indebted to Lee Walburn, the current editor of Atlanta
Magazine, for one of my tedious moments in sports. Lee, another
alumnus of the Furman Bisher School of Journalism, was, in one of
his incarnations, chief publicist for the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco Giants had been in town. The Giants had a
particular distaste for Atlanta sportswriters. We suspected it was
because of Willie Mays' jealousy of Hank Aaron, who, besides
hitting all those home runs, was a respected gentleman who never
threatened a sportswriter with anything more lethal than a thrown
strawberry.
</P>
<P>
   I avoided baseball assignments, largely because watching
baseball before October is about as exciting as watching okra
sprout. Any game I was forced to cover went into extra innings,
which knocked out any chance of watching Johnny Carson.
</P>
<P>
   I had been unable to wiggle out of going to the stadium to do
what we called a sidebar on the Giants. A sidebar is a feature
story that fills up space around the game story.
</P>
<P>
   After the Giants left town, Walburn, who never passed up a
chance to make mischief, called to say the Giants didn't like what
I had written and were saying I better not show up at the stadium
the next time they came to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   About a week before the Giants were due back, Walburn called
again. ``You remember what they said about you not showing up,'' he
said. ``You aren't going to let them get away with that, are you?''
</P>
<P>
   I would have been perfectly happy not to show up, but under
Walburn's prodding I agreed to uphold the honor of Atlanta
sportswriters.
</P>
<P>
   I knew I would have a problem with Herman Franks, the Giants'
crusty manager. Herman had all the qualifications of a mid-20th
century baseball manager. He could cuss, chew tobacco, spit and
scratch.
</P>
<P>
   Sportswriters assigned to do sidebars have to go on the field
before games and ask questions about sore arms, pitching rotations,
batting slumps and all that stuff. When writers interviewed Franks,
his tactic throughout the conversation was to spit tobacco juice
into the dirt around their feet. Although he was a very accurate
spitter, the little wet plops narrowly missing your shoes were
disconcerting.
</P>
<P>
   In my early years on the farm, I had some experience with
chewing tobacco. I had studied the techniques of expert spitters
who spent winter afternoons sitting around the potbellied stove in
Mr. Marvin Lamb's store, peppering the sandbox. In anticipation of
my encounter with Franks, I bought a six-pack of Red Man. Without
my wife's knowledge, I slipped into the back yard each night after
supper to practice chewing and spitting.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants were back in town. We were standing between third and
home plate. Franks zeroed in on my right foot, I fired back at his
left. The infield dirt around us rolled up in spent spitballs. The
contest must have lasted 10 minutes, until we both ran dry. Walburn
claimed I won. More likely it was a draw. Either way, many people
consider the spitting contest with Herman Franks in Atlanta Stadium
the highlight of my checkered career in journalism.
</P>
<P>
   Postscript: After Norm Van Brocklin was no longer coach of the
Falcons and I was no longer a sportswriter we became good friends.
It's wise to remember that in these things the best of us usually
aren't all good, and the worst of us usually aren't all bad.

Journal-Constitution, 692 N. Glynn St., Suite A, Fayetteville, GA

 &HT;    Love of woodcraft shouldn't exceed common sense
 &HT;    Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There tends to be a great deal of romance surrounding
any ancient craft such as woodworking or pottery.
</P>
<P>
   This is all well and good, but a woodworker needs to recognize
it for what it is and not get too bound up in it.
</P>
<P>
   It's usually at its strongest in the beginning stages of
experience, and when coupled with the natural urge to save a buck,
it can lead to a lot of misfortune.
</P>
<P>
   This is all brought to mind by a post to an Internet woodworking
group by a man who just bought an old house and is getting into
woodworking.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old guy who lived there before me was a tinkerer and he
kept everything, especially wood. Well, I have these two pieces
that are about 3 by 11 inches and 7 or 8 feet long. It's some kind
of hard wood. I want to use it for a work bench, as he did, but
they are all beat up. They have gouges, holes and some nails.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to clean these boards up, but I don't know the best
way. I would like to take them someplace and have them planed down
on all sides, but there are nails in there that I can't get to.
Will a shop still do this, with the possibility of screwing up
their cutters? Can I do this myself with the aforementioned tools
(radial saw, cheap table saw and bandsaw)?''
</P>
<P>
   My friend, let it go. There's lots of hard wood (he means really
hard hardwood) around that doesn't have nails in it.
</P>
<P>
   You might find a millwork shop willing to clean up those boards
if you agree to pay for any damage to their machine. Since you seem
pretty sure they're going to encounter a nail, then you can count
on paying up. If they're as bad as you indicate, you'll probably
pay up several times.
</P>
<P>
   By the time you're through paying for what those boards might
have spent enough to build a whole workbench out of cocobolo, and
be the envy of everyone on the Net.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the boards didn't have nails in them, working wood this
old is no fun. The stuff is terribly hard on sawblades and any
other edged tool. It produces a very fine dust that can drive you
crazy. You can get Z into it, if you need screws, only with great
difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   T'aint worth it.
</P>
<P>
   Next comes an interesting question from a man who needs ``to
apply pressure to a sheet of plastic that measures approximately 8
inches square. The plastic is approximately 1/16 of an inch thick.
The plastic will be heated to approximately 250 degrees F while a
curing process completes, which will take approximately 10 minutes.
Only a few pounds of pressure per square inch will be needed, not
much more than you could apply by hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to ensure that the pressure is applied evenly across
the surface of the plastic.'' I'd try to rig up something like a
simple veneer press. Take a couple of pieces of good 3/4-inch
plywood, preferably Baltic birch or Appleply, get a clamp with at
least a 4-inch throat _ the simple wooden European clamps would be
adequate _ sandwich the metal-clad plastic between the plywood and
apply pressure in the dead center of the sandwich. Just make sure
the metal is perfectly flat.

<P>
   WARNER-ON-WOOD _ ATLANTA _There tends to be a great deal of
romance surrounding any ancient craft such as woodworking or
pottery. This is all well and good, but a woodworker needs to
recognize it for what it is and not get too bound up in it. It's
usually at its strongest in the beginning stages of experience, and
when coupled with the natural urge to save a buck, it can lead to a
lot of misfortune. (Warner, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.

<P>
   GLIDERS _ Five minutes after takeoff, when we reach 3,000 feet
in a pristine sky, glider pilot Rich Carraway releases the line
from the tow plane and banks our two-seater sailplane gently to the
north _ free, as the poet said, of the surly bonds of earth.
Nothing but the wind whispering now around our clear plastic
canopy. We're in a peaceful bubble floating over a checkerboard of
Warren County farms and forests just a few miles east of Caesar
Creek Lake. Even for a shameless wuss like myself, who has a
paralyzing fear of heights, my 20-minute ride as a guest passenger
with the Caesar Creek Soaring Club was as gentle and agreeable as
many of the club's 200-plus members. (Dayton Daily News). 27. WITH

   HOWARD-FINSTER _ SUMMERVILLE, Ga. _ Word was out that the Rev.
Howard Finster, the godfather of saving souls, the hardest working
man in the folk art business, had been seriously sick. So the
faithful flocked to Paradise Garden, his wild 3-acre folk version
of the Garden of Eden, during last month's Howard Finster Fest, a
show and sale that offered a thoroughly mixed bag of 60 artists but
only one Howard. With the ailing 83-year-old artist recovering from
double pneumonia and congestive heart failure and battling
diabetes, many visitors worried it might be the last chance to see
Finster, get his autograph, hear one of his classic sermonettes.
And, some feared, it might be the final opportunity to visit
Paradise. (Pousner, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 77. WITH PHOTOS.

Salvation Army is meeting in Atlanta _ its first time ever in North

unpolluted skies generate a sense of freedom,'' Hadley says. ``This

 &HT;    Suggestion that U.S. take steps to limit influx might not be a
bad idea
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The inscription on the Statue of Liberty that
encourages the world's huddled masses to become American citizens
should be considered a historic curiosity, not an immigration
policy.
</P>
<P>
   That's the way I read an opinion piece in the Washington Post by
two crusty old politicians worried that America's quality of life
is deteriorating in proportion to population growth.
</P>
<P>
   The double authors of the June 20 article are Alan K. Simpson,
the former cowboy senator from Wyoming, and Richard D. Lamm, the
former governor of Colorado. Simpson is a Republican and Lamm is a
Democrat. That makes the warning about the dangers of large-scale
immigration a bipartisan effort, for whatever that's worth.
</P>
<P>
   Other than their party affiliations, the two men have a lot in
common. They both come from America's West, which includes a
certain shared mindset for citizens who reside from the Great
Plains up to, but not including, the masses of Americans huddled
along the Pacific coast.
</P>
<P>
   Both men were political mavericks capable of ignoring for New
York Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia's advice: ``A politician can't be so
far ahead of the band that he can't hear the music.''
</P>
<P>
   Simpson, who now is director of the Institute of Politics at
Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government, and
Lamm, who now is director of the Center for Public Policy and
Contemporary Issues at the University of Denver, show that they
continue to march to their own internal drummers far ahead of the
band.
</P>
<P>
   EITHER WRONG OR FAR AHEAD
</P>
<P>
   That does not necessarily mean that their ideas on immigration,
the environment, public health, urban congestion and the rest are
wrong; it may mean that it's going to take time for the rest of the
country to catch up with them.
</P>
<P>
   The two men warn that new census figures show a population of
571 million Americans by the year 2100. The doubling of America's
population, the men write, is a projection, not an inevitability.
</P>
<P>
   Actions taken by Americans today can avoid the problems caused
by the projected population explosion, according to Simpson and
Lamm. Those problems will include the burdens placed on the
nation's health care system, schools, environment, parks, housing,
highways and all the other structures of society.
</P>
<P>
   If American women continue to average two children in a
lifetime, as they do now, the nation's population will stabilize in
the middle of the next century. The projected doubling of the
America's population by the next century will come from
immigration, which is something that can be controlled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without question immigration has been good for America, and of
course we are all immigrants, directly or indirectly,'' Simpson and
Lamm write. ``But the challenge of public policy is to recognize
when circumstances change _ when, as the poet warns, `time makes
ancient good uncouth.'''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the words on the base of the Statue of Liberty
were valid back when our young country was trying to settle a new
land, but not necessarily valid today.
</P>
<P>
   The mighty woman with a torch who stands in New York harbor is
named ``Mother of Exiles,'' according to Emma Lazarus' famous poem
engraved on the pedestal below the statue.
</P>
<P>
   The part of the poem that has guided America's immigration
policy says: ``Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses
yearning to breathe free, the wretched refuse of your teeming
shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me, I lift up my
lamp beside the golden door!''
</P>
<P>
   These two crusty Westerners warn that without tighter controls
on America's immigration policies, it will be this country's
huddled masses who will yearn to breathe free.

   WARNER-ON-WOOD _ ATLANTA _There tends to be a great deal of
romance surrounding any ancient craft such as woodworking or
pottery. This is all well and good, but a woodworker needs to
recognize it for what it is and not get too bound up in it. It's
usually at its strongest in the beginning stages of experience, and
when coupled with the natural urge to save a buck, it can lead to a
lot of misfortune. (Warner, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.

   GLIDERS _ Five minutes after takeoff, when we reach 3,000 feet
in a pristine sky, glider pilot Rich Carraway releases the line
from the tow plane and banks our two-seater sailplane gently to the
north _ free, as the poet said, of the surly bonds of earth.
Nothing but the wind whispering now around our clear plastic
canopy. We're in a peaceful bubble floating over a checkerboard of
Warren County farms and forests just a few miles east of Caesar
Creek Lake. Even for a shameless wuss like myself, who has a
paralyzing fear of heights, my 20-minute ride as a guest passenger
with the Caesar Creek Soaring Club was as gentle and agreeable as
many of the club's 200-plus members. (Dayton Daily News). 27. WITH

   HOWARD-FINSTER _ SUMMERVILLE, Ga. _ Word was out that the Rev.
Howard Finster, the godfather of saving souls, the hardest working
man in the folk art business, had been seriously sick. So the
faithful flocked to Paradise Garden, his wild 3-acre folk version
of the Garden of Eden, during last month's Howard Finster Fest, a
show and sale that offered a thoroughly mixed bag of 60 artists but
only one Howard. With the ailing 83-year-old artist recovering from
double pneumonia and congestive heart failure and battling
diabetes, many visitors worried it might be the last chance to see
Finster, get his autograph, hear one of his classic sermonettes.
And, some feared, it might be the final opportunity to visit
Paradise. (Pousner, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 77. WITH PHOTOS.

   SALVATION-ARMY _ ATLANTA _ The international congress of the
Salvation Army is meeting in Atlanta _ its first time ever in North
America. One reason is probably that the Army already has a large

North Druid Hills Road. Through the lives of a couple of officers

   VIENNA - Apart from the traditional sites of this seat of

faces the Danube Canal in a neighborhood where there are no
palaces. What makes the building appear unusual are the windows. No
two are alike. This is KunstHausWien, a privately-operated and

year, Hadley visited Africa's gem, Namibia, ``where desert kisses

unpolluted skies generate a sense of freedom,'' Hadley says. ``This
feeling of tranquility and stillness combines with a landscape that

shade...'' (Hadley, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) WITH PHOTOS. FOR

 &HT;    What choice would you make if you could only have 2 books?
 &HT;    By Phil Latham
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   We'll call it Jane's Decision, because I don't know her real
name. I only know her story.
</P>
<P>
   The story came to me through the Internet which, I suppose,
might make it suspect in the eyes of some. After all, anything can
be said on the Internet, right? Indeed, I have no way to know for
certain whether this is fact or fiction.
</P>
<P>
   My senses, though, lead me to believe it is fact. For one thing,
it is difficult to make up stories this good or this touching.
Either way it hardly matters. As a novelist friend of mine once
told me, it is easier to to tell the truth with fiction than with
non-fiction. Go figure.
</P>
<P>
   Jane made her decision years ago and she was nothing more than a
child, under 10 years old at the time. It wasn't something she
wanted to do, but ultimately either she would have made a decision
or it would have been made for her. Sometimes children have to make
adult decisions. Sometimes it is adults who force them to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Such it was with Jane, whose mother announced one day _ this
would have been in the '60s, naturally _ that the family was
selling the house and moving. Under ordinary circumstances, this
could have been an exciting time, if somewhat scary. These were not
ordinary circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Because the family wasn't going to buy another house. No, they
were going to see the world, be children of the universe: The
mother and step-father bought a bus.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds faintly amusing, doesn't it? Just to hear it like that
you get a feeling for the absurd, but nothing that might be truly
damaging.
</P>
<P>
   Until you consider logistics. When one lives in a bus, travels
and eats in a bus, does everything in a bus, logistics is pretty
much everything.
</P>
<P>
   Logistics landed on Jane's head the day her mother told her that
certain things would have to be cut back if everything was to fit
on the bus.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, Jane's books were, well, a nuisance. They didn't
fit in the plans. After all, she had between 300 and 400 books, a
library she had built from books given to her since birth.
</P>
<P>
   Jane was willing to do her part. She could get rid of some of
the books. Truth to tell, some of them were pretty raggedy anyway.
</P>
<P>
   So Jane's question was: How many can I keep?
</P>
<P>
   Her mother's answer was: Two.
</P>
<P>
   Two?
</P>
<P>
   Two.
</P>
<P>
   Those who own more than a few books can begin to appreciate
Jane's Decision. Think of owning 300 and having to dispose of all
but two in the space of just a few days.
</P>
<P>
   She pleaded with her mother to let her keep more, but there was
only so much room on the bus. The books would have to go, sold in a
yard sale.
</P>
<P>
   And so Jane made her decision, book by book, agonizing choice by
choice. Characters whose lives she'd never hold in her hands again.
</P>
<P>
   So you're probably wondering which two books did she choose to
keep?
</P>
<P>
   One was ``Black Beauty'' that had been a scruffy copy when she
first got it, a hand-me-down but a book she purely loved.
</P>
<P>
   And the second book? A photo album that contained the only
picture she had of her brother who died when she was seven years
old.
</P>
<P>
   Two books. Jane's Decision had been both difficult and easy.
Difficult to cast the others aside, but an easy choice of which
ones to keep.
</P>
<P>
   From the item I received, Jane's library today is back near the
300 or 400-book range. Her tastes have changed, of course, but one
thing hasn't changed.
</P>
<P>
   In bookcase in her house, in a place of honor and safety there
are two books tucked aside. One is an ancient, but still readable,
copy of ``Black Beauty.'' The other isn't really a book at all, it
is a photo album with a very special picture inside.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know Jane, don't even know her real name, but I'm
guessing that should that terrible choice have to come again, the
decision would be exactly the same.

DRAG AND ... IT'S JUST A DRAG
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I am in dire need of your perspicacity. My
current system is disgusting (a Pentium II with Windows 98 Second
Edition). The clock will lose a full day in about two weeks. Also,
when you click the mouse pointer on something, there is a delay,
and when I type, there is a delay before the letters show up. I
call the hardware manufacturer, and he blames the software or the
operating system. I call the software company, and they blame the
hardware or the OS. I have never been able to talk to a real person
at Microsoft, so I am unsure who they'd blame.
</P>
<P>
   _ Slow Motion
</P>
<P>
   DEAR SLOW: There are no real people at Microsoft. I mean, have
you ever actually seen anyone who works there, other than Big Bill
or Steve Ballmer? Or maybe the're all just hiding in their
windowless little offices, eating aerosol cheese and sardines,
hoping nobody asks them why their products are so full of bugs.
</P>
<P>
   One thing I really hate about trying to run down a problem with
no clear solution is trying to get a straight answer out of a
support technician. I wish they'd just say they don't have a clue
instead of pointing a finger at somebody else. And before you say
it, yes, I've done the same thing when I've wanted to get rid of a
particularly annoying user and get back to playing Unreal
Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, since I know I'll get the run-around from three or four
different help desks, I generally start looking for the answer
myself somewhere out there on the Internet. Try the Knowledge Base
at Microsoft (support.microsoft.com) first, although ``knowledge''
is a bit of a stretch. Maybe ``Stuff We Figured Out For Whiny
Users'' didn't sound so hot to the Marketing Department.
</P>
<P>
   Most software and hardware companies have similar collections of
fixes and suggestions on their Web sites. Just look for ``support''
links.
</P>
<P>
   The best places to find an answer, however, are news groups,
where you post a message and hopefully get an answer. When the
Internet was more text-based, these groups were fabulous places for
finding people with similar interests and problems, software,
little-known tips and, of course, dirty pictures. New Internet
users often pass the groups by, probably because the dirty pictures
are easier to see using a browser.
</P>
<P>
   Cruising the groups, I learned that you're not the only one out
there losing time and putting up with a jerky mouse and keyboard.
Most PC clocks are about as accurate as my SATs, plus a flaky
battery will exacerbate the problem. But there's something else
afoot here, a conspiracy of major proportions. OK, maybe not a
conspiracy and maybe not major, but let me point a few fingers
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Many people report the slowdowns happen after installing Win98
Second Edition or Microsoft's Y2K patches. Others complain that it
all started after installing Norton AntiVirus 5.0 with
Auto-Protect, which runs all the time. And even Microsoft says that
your system can slow down when running stuff like a virus checker
in the background. No definitive answer, but there are a few clues.
</P>
<P>
   Some programs just don't play well with Win98, so turn off your
virus checker and see if things speed up. No? Try this: Shut down
everything else that's going on behind the scenes. If you hit
Control-Alt-Delete, you'll get a dialogue box that lets you end
individual tasks. You can safely knock out everything but Explorer
and Systray. If that doesn't work, go back to the Microsoft support
site and look for document Q259161 for some other suggestions.

DOWSING ON MARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Reports that water may have flowed on Mars bring closer the
answer to the much more tantalizing question of whether some form
of primitive life may have developed there. It is a question that,
by itself, justifies the efforts of NASA and other space programs
to explore Earth's fascinating neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   That water has been present on Mars in the past, in large
quantities, had become generally accepted in the scientific
community. Long stretches of beachlike terrain are taken as
evidence of lakes or even oceans that have long since dried up. But
photographic surveys by the Mars Global Surveyor have spotted
evidence of water flows on steep slopes that may be much newer, an
indication that water might still exist fairly close to the
surface. It may have been drawn from relatively shallow reservoirs
secure from a harsh environment that could not retain the earlier
abundance of water.
</P>
<P>
   Space programs that envision human visits to Mars will gain
plausibility if there is water on the planet. It could serve the
human need for water and, by electrolysis, be broken down into
hydrogen and oxygen to fuel voyages back to Earth.
</P>
<P>
   The greater interest, on a scientific scale, is in discovering
whether some form of life developed. On Earth, primitive life forms
apparently began in oceans still being rocked by deep-water
volcanic activity. Even today, ocean vents have been host to simple
types of life, suggesting that it can begin under difficult
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, evidence of past life on Mars would reinforce
theories that life throughout the universe would not only be
possible but likely wherever water and an even slightly
accommodating environment are found. With the detection of other
planetary systems _ albeit of a very different character than our
own _ evidence is mounting to support that speculation.
</P>
<P>
   The Mars Global Surveyor has balanced some of the disappointment
of losing two other Mars probes last year. Its success, and the
promise of being able to learn much more, call for persistence in
pursuing the program despite its setbacks.

   AUTO-FORD-TRUCK (San Antonio) _ After a few minutes _ no,
actually, just a few seconds _ behind the wheel of the Ford F-150
SVT Lightning pickup, this week's test drive, I was glad of two
things. One: That it is not often that I get vehicles like this to
test drive, otherwise I would get into trouble. And two: That there
was no traffic cop riding behind me when I goosed the gas the first
time. By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III.

   FILM-REVIEW-CHICKEN (Undated) _ Speaking frankly, here, the
chickens in ``Chicken Run'' don't look all that chickeny. Their

   REDFISH (Aransas Pass, Texas) _ Rats to bulls, there's nothing
like redfish fishing on the flats in the summertime. The bronzed
and brawny heavyweights spend the first years of life cruising the
shallow bay waters, rooting crabs from the sea grass, smacking gold
spoons, popping leaders, breaking hearts. Early in life, redfish
are called rats, or rat-reds. The name is not derogatory. Rather,
it denotes fish under the 20-inch minimum legal possession length
set by the state. Any redfish too small to be kept legally is a
rat. By RON STRAIT.

<TEXT>
<P>
   I can foresee the e-junk-mail of the next Internet generation:
``Dear Joe: We know you like adult movies, but we also know you
have never seen sex like this. Keep this sample with our
compliments and sign up for a weekly treat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Mary: We heard your chat room complaint about the apple
cake crust. Next time try our pie plate and special mix. Just click
here and be the star of your next church bazaar!''
</P>
<P>
   Because they can't find the word ``privacy'' in the
Constitution, our courts, from the Supremes on down, are refusing
to help consumers fend off horrendous intrusions into personal
life. And so the Internet is fast becoming a giant spy network that
gathers and peddles a record of what we read, write, watch, think
and buy to make us ever more precise targets of unsolicited ads,
mail and marketing ploys.
</P>
<P>
   The technology of intrusion now infests virtually every Web
page, browser, e-mail message and chat room, and it relentlessly
tracks our individual movements, interests, moods and even
keystrokes. As a result there is a multivolume cyberarchive
matching up tens of millions of names, addresses, ages and personal
characteristics with the books and underwear we bought, the stocks
we sold, the music we downloaded and the cancer facts we once
pursued.
</P>
<P>
   Huge sums are being spent to harvest these nuggets of
information and to bundle them for delivery to both online and
off-line advertisers and merchants. The Big Brother industry, like
most Web enterprises, is not yet earning big bucks, but it is
betting that customized and fancy new Internet imagery will invade
our minds to much greater effect than the catalogs and junk mail
that have long filled our mailboxes.
</P>
<P>
   In time, the courts may wise up, but by then we may all be not
only cataloged but also palm-printed and even facially digitized.
Too many judges are failing to recognize the urgent need to balance
the First and Fourth Amendments, the rights of corporate free
speech against the right of people to ``be secure in their persons,
houses, papers and effects.''
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, the Supreme Court refused even to hear an
appeal from the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which struck
down a ruling of the Federal Communications Commission to limit US
West's use of information about its customers.
</P>
<P>
   The commission wanted the phone company to ask all customers to
consent to the release and ulterior use of personal information.
But the court stood by the company's weak offer to make people opt
out by withdrawing permission _ if they could find and decipher the
obscure instructions for doing so.
</P>
<P>
   As you can discover on the vast majority of Web sites, that
prepositional distinction between opting ``in'' and ``out'' marks
the difference between meaningful and disingenuous respect for
privacy. Web merchants have made a show of ``self-regulation'' by
posting lengthy and complicated statements of ``privacy policies,''
many of which permit diligent readers to withdraw from some lists
and warn them of intrusions by third parties.
</P>
<P>
   But in only a minority of cases _ like The New York Times Web
site _ is the language of these cautions unambiguous. And even when
clear, the warnings and instructions are not standardized; they
must be hunted down and mastered on every Web page you ever visit.
</P>
<P>
   Also like The Times' site, some major sites promise to use their
customer data only in an anonymous aggregate, to help advertisers
focus their messages and assess the results. But most ``policy''
statements are contradictory, hard to locate, subject to change and
lacking any mechanism for enforcement or redress.
</P>
<P>
   If the courts persist in thus favoring property over privacy,
the only real remedy is to write laws that will treat privacy as
valuable property. That is hardly a radical proposition.
</P>
<P>
   All of us regularly and knowingly trade our privacy for
commercial benefit. We accept phone calls at awkward moments for
the convenience of being connected. We volunteer our Visa card
numbers and leave a trail of our purchases for the comfort of
shopping from home. We leave a bar-coded menu of our favorite foods
for a quick supermarket checkout.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us have learned that the personal information we yield
has commercial value. It is property that the receivers routinely
sell to other merchants so that they can bombard us with
solicitations tailored to our surmised lifestyles. But atomized
consumers lack the power to command a decent price for this
informational property.
</P>
<P>
   When a pollster calls me to sample my political views or tastes
in food, I can refuse to answer unless he shares some of his fee.
But I cannot strike a deal with the anonymous spies that pursue me
online. If America's marketers really believed in a free market,
they would fully expose themselves and their data traffic and let
me decide whether the price is right.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of baiting me with offers of a ``free'' search engine,
e-mail and current stock quotes, Yahoo should be required when I
enter its site to define those services as payment for its right to
resell my identity and online habits to other merchants.
</P>
<P>
   The Times' Web site should explain up front that it is not
giving its news away without charge; it is bartering the news and
other services to learn about reader interests for the commercial
benefit of advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   Upon entering an iWon.com lottery for millions of dollars, I
ought to be told which ``sponsors or business partners'' it says in
fine print will share in the registration information I supply. And
even if I keep watch, as instructed, for iWon policy changes, who
will police its partners?
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, we need laws, like those for truth in lending, to
regulate truth in surfing. Web sites should be required to adopt
standardized technologies to expose the full extent of their use of
personal information and to seek their customers' ``opt in''
consent. The same should be required of third parties who then buy
or share that information.
</P>
<P>
   And any change in the deal should require a new agreement. I may
welcome countless future offers that play to my interests, but I
want something of value in exchange for exposing myself to
strangers, for the burden on my computer and for the time I spend
sorting through the flood of e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   If what I tell you about myself has an ulterior market value
beyond our immediate Web transaction, I deserve to be told your
intentions, asked to approve and be acceptably paid.

 (ART ADV: A locator map of Zimbabwe and southern Africa is
available by calling William Gonzalez at 212-499-3355.) 
 By PETER GODWIN  
 c.2000 The New York Times Magazine  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is hunting season in the African country of my birth,
Zimbabwe, and the quarry this year is white farmers and their black
workers. Caught in the cross hairs of a deadly political safari are
some 4,000 white farmers who, 20 years after the end of white rule,
still own more than one-third of the best land in a country of 12.5
million black people.
</P>
<P>
   When I grew up in Zimbabwe in the 1960s, it was still Southern
Rhodesia, a British colony. We lived on a farm of sorts, one of a
huge series of estates strung out along the Chimanimani Mountains
that formed the border with Mozambique. With its bracken-covered
hills and its steep, verdant valleys, the land there reminded the
first white settlers of their Scottish homeland. That they were not
the first on this land did not trouble the white pioneers overmuch.
It was only sparsely populated, and the locals _ the Shona and the
Ndebele _ were quickly crushed when they tried to rebel. Soon the
white farmers settled on the best land, a well-watered plateau free
of the dreaded cattle-killing tsetse fly.
</P>
<P>
   When Britain began to shed hastily its African colonies in the
late 1950s, Rhodesia's white rulers gulped with trepidation at the
chaos that inevitably seemed to follow independence and demanded
that their white rule be preserved. London refused, and the
Rhodesian leader, Ian Smith, unilaterally declared independence in
1965. The country became an international pariah. Blacks took up
arms against the white minority government soon thereafter in a
seven-year war that killed more than 30,000 civilians, mostly
black.
</P>
<P>
   But there were white fatalities too, especially out on the
farms, many of which were transformed into fortresses and came
under frequent guerrilla attack. Many of the whites left, and their
population dwindled from a high of nearly 300,000 in the mid-1960s
to just 70,000 today.
</P>
<P>
   Exhausted from war, the country finally embraced peace and held
its first democratic election in 1980. It was won by the political
wing of one of the two black guerrilla groups, the largely
Shona-based Zimbabwe African National Union party of Robert Mugabe,
who was hailed as a liberation hero.
</P>
<P>
   Freed of U.N. sanctions, Zimbabwe was bolstered by outside
investment and aid. The new government espoused a policy of racial
reconciliation, and with the most developed economy in black-ruled
Africa, it carried the hopes of the continent on its back. From the
start Mugabe pledged to rectify the distorted pattern of land
ownership, which had been a major cause of the war.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of an agreement with Britain, white land would
change hands on a voluntary basis, at market prices, and Britain
and other countries would put up over $100 million to finance the
buyouts of white farmers. More than 8.5 million acres of land was
bought from white farmers by the government. But Mugabe gave most
of this land to his cronies instead of allocating it to landless
peasants as stipulated by the donors. So Britain eventually froze
its aid, and the land transfers stalled. The land issue sprang into
the headlines again earlier this year when Mugabe suddenly acquired
a true opposition after two decades of almost unchallenged power.
</P>
<P>
   Ten months ago, the Movement for Democratic Change burst onto
the political stage, an outgrowth of the trade-union movement. Led
by Morgan Tsvangirai, the MDC grew in the upswell of popular
dissatisfaction with Mugabe's increasingly despotic behavior and
his government's slide into kleptocracy. The figures tell of a
crushing economic collapse in the two decades of Mugabe's rule. In
1980 the Zimbabwean dollar was worth $1.58 in American currency.
Today it's worth just 2.6 cents. In 1980 Zimbabwe's gross domestic
product per capita was $740. Today, GDP per capita is down to an
estimated $575. In 1980 inflation was just under 7 percent. Today
it's over 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The overall effect on black living standards has been
devastating. The scope of the MDC's threat became apparent only in
February, when Mugabe, now 76, held a referendum in which he asked
the electorate to extend his already considerable constitutional
powers. And to ensure the desired outcome, he tacked on what he
thought would be an irresistible enticement to black voters: the
confiscation of white farmland, without compensation. The whites
stole the land from us originally, he argued; why should we pay
them to get it back? The Movement campaigned for a ``no'' vote,
opposing Mugabe's effort to aggrandize his position still further,
but also arguing that commercial farming was one of the few
activities sustaining an ailing economy. In an outcome that
astonished everyone, the referendum was resoundingly defeated.
</P>
<P>
   Although many groups had campaigned for a ``no'' vote, Mugabe
blamed the Movement for his referendum defeat, citing support the
MDC got from white farmers and their black employees. In an
escalating series of race-baiting statements, he denounced white
farmers as ``nonindigenous,'' ``Britain's Children'' and finally
``enemies of Zimbabwe.'' Then he unleashed the so-called war
veterans, a ragtag group comprised of remnants of the guerrilla
force that had once fought for majority rule and unemployed youths
who could not have fought in a war that ended 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In the last four months the ``war vets,'' who number a few
thousand, have invaded nearly a third _ more than 1,400 _ of
white-owned farms. During the takeovers, five farmers have been
murdered, four of them associated with the opposition, and dozens
of others have been beaten and intimidated. The farm occupations
have been carried out with Mugabe's explicit blessing _ ``we are
actually very happy for them to be there,'' he said recently _ as
part of his strategy to win parliamentary elections being held the
weekend of June 24th.
</P>
<P>
   Although his presidential term isn't up until 2002, Mugabe's
ZANU-PF party needs to win a parliamentary majority in order for
him to rule effectively. With the government coffers empty, he can
dole out land ``gifts'' to a rural electorate that makes up 65
percent of voters, some of whom are understandably frustrated at
the slow rate of land reform _ even though those delays are mostly
the government's own fault. The government has tried its best to
characterize the farm invasions as a spontaneous uprising by a
land-hungry peasantry. But in a recent poll carried out by the
Helen Suzman Foundation, only 9 percent of black Zimbabweans said
that land was their most pressing concern, and 55 percent said they
were satisfied with the land ownership as it was before the
invasions began.
</P>
<P>
   David Stobart's Atlanta farm, 25 miles northeast of the capital,
Harare, was among the first farms to be invaded in March. On my way
there, I pass squads of ZANU-PF youth league members in their party
T-shirts marching up and down the middle of the road. Eventually, I
arrive at a small wooden sign. ``War Vets Jurisdiction,'' it reads.
Sitting on the culvert next to it are several middle-age black men
in faded blue overalls. Their stern-faced leader strolls over and
introduces himself in Shona as Pondai MaBunhu. It means ``Kill the
Whites'' (or literally, ``Kill the Boers,'' a common derogation for
all whites).
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a pretty frightening name,'' I say, trying to make
light of it, and he cracks a smile. ``We don't hate all white
people, just some of them,'' says Pondai. ``Why are you here?'' I
ask. ``We want a piece of this farm,'' says Pondai quietly. ``But
we are waiting for instructions from the government.'' And he waves
us on, past his little sign, out of his territory.
</P>
<P>
   Stobart employs 60 people on about 450 acres of arable land
planted with burley tobacco, maize, soybeans, ground nuts and
wheat, and which also supports beef cattle and pigs. His workers
were enthusiastic supporters of the MDC. Many of them, as is often
the case with farm workers here, are the descendants of immigrants
from neighboring Malawi and Mozambique. Though not well paid, they
are considered lucky in a country where most are unemployed. And
the white-owned farms are now their only homes.
</P>
<P>
   When the vets first arrived on Atlanta demanding the land, says
Stobart, ``I told them that if anyone else is to get my land, it
would be the farm laborers who work here. And they said, 'No, they
can leave, we don't care about them.' My workers heard this
conversation and a few days later the aggro between them started.
The vets abducted one of my guys, handcuffed his hands behind his
knees and took him to the river to drown him.'' A few weeks later,
the workers repulsed the invaders. But over time, the situation
grew more tense. In mid-April, they set fire to the barns,
Stobart's son's house and the workers' homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``My labor has scattered in all directions into the fields,''
Stobart says. ``A lot of these guys have been with me for over 40
years. They've lost everything, including their ID cards, so none
of them can vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Stobart, early on, had requested help from the police, but when
they arrived, they made no attempt to stop the attack. Zimbabwe's
attorney general has explicitly told law officers not to interfere
with farm raids, despite court orders outlawing them. Mugabe has
said that the farmers should not resist the illegal invasions,
warning, ``If they resist, they will die.''
</P>
<P>
   The vets were initially provided with food rations and modest
stipends by the government, and senior sources in the ruling party
have admitted the army's involvement in providing logistical
support for the invasions. The war vets are led by a Polish-trained
doctor, Chenjerai Hunzvi, who still proudly uses the nom de guerre
Hitler. (During Zimbabwe's war of independence black guerrillas
took such pseudonyms _ the more frightening the better.) But the
relationship between Mugabe and Hunzvi seems to be an uneasy one,
and there is a growing concern among human rights groups, and even
privately among some members of the government, that the vets are
above the law and may become impossible to control, even after the
elections.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few weeks, Mugabe has designated more than 800 farms
for immediate confiscation. And Hunzvi has announced that these
farms will be occupied on a first-come, first-served basis. Farmers
fear that this will trigger general anarchy and destroy productive
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   Just over the hill from atlanta farm, in the village of
Goromonzi, I witness another part of Mugabe's electoral strategy in
action _ the intimidation of the black opposition. Members of the
Movement for Democratic Change have taken me to one of their safe
houses, where supporters who have fled their homes are
congregating. The gate is guarded by boys with sticks and clubs,
but they radiate fear, and the house owner, Leonard Mapuranga, a
Movement official, tells me that the war vets ``are planning to
overrun this place day and night.''
</P>
<P>
   In the garden sit dozens of MDC supporters who are victims of
the wave of pre-election violence. Independent human rights
monitors believe that ruling-party militants and war vets are
responsible for instigating at least 90 percent of incidents of
violence and intimidation. By mid-June, more than 30 people
(including the five white farmers) had died, nearly all of them
opposition supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Farai is a schoolteacher who would rather not give his surname.
Teachers have been a special target of the vets and ZANU-PF youth
squads. He was in a staff meeting when his school was attacked by a
truckload of vets armed with sticks and machetes.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the children ran away screaming and we ran, too, and the
school has remained closed since,'' he says. It is one of hundreds
of schools closed across the country after systematic intimidation.
``We have had thousands of kidnappings and assaults, but the police
take no action,'' says Mapuranga. ``Let's face it: we are living in
a lawless state.''
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty International endorses his view. ``There is a deliberate
plan,'' said its Africa director, Maina Kiai. ``It started with the
farmers, then moved to the farm workers and on to teachers and
businessmen and now to the opposition. It is clearly
state-sponsored terrorism.'' The present climate, he concluded,
``is not conducive to free and fair elections.''
</P>
<P>
   While most white farmers are scared to talk to the media, it is
equally difficult to get the vets to talk, and most are simply
following orders. One of the few willing to speak to me was Comrade
Muroyi (which means wizard in Shona). After a few shared cigarettes
and some pleasantries in my rudimentary Shona, he told why he had
decided to take the land by force.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went back to stay with my parents after the liberation
war,'' he explains. ``But there I am plowing only two acres to
support two wives and nine children.'' So why invade the farms now,
after 20 years? ``The government kept promising us land but we
never got anything. They were not able to give us land before,
because of the laws. That's why we have done it for ourselves. It
is our spoils of war.''
</P>
<P>
   He is joined by his boss, Comrade Satan. ``We will live together
with the white farmers,'' Satan explains, showing me on a map the
territory he is claiming. ``We will take half of each farm and we
will plant our crops, just like them. And if we need tractors we
will borrow them from the white farmer, and if we have money we
will pay for their use.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Satan's words and even as the occupations proceed, a
swath of prime white farms is available for sale to the government,
land on which resettlement projects could be established. And
nearly one million more acres are already in government hands,
still waiting for the necessary infrastructure that can convert it
from large-scale commercial units into smaller plots.
</P>
<P>
   Comrade Satan's justification for the land takeover is belied by
a macabre monument that stands at the entrance of the vets' camp.
It is a huge grave. At one end there is a cross on which has been
scrawled the name of the grave's intended occupant: Morgan
Tsvangirai, the leader of the Movement and Mugabe's chief political
rival. At the base of the cross is an MDC T-shirt with its heart
burnt out. It seems pretty clear to all of us standing here what
the vets' real mission is.
</P>
<P>
   If ZANU-PF does return to power, the white farmers of Zimbabwe
will face an uncertain future. Mugabe has warned that it is the
``totality'' of their land in which he is interested, and that any
farmers permitted to stay will do so only on the basis ``of our own
charity.''

   When it comes to nudity, actresses are just like you and me _
self-conscious, vain, insecure, eager to please and sometimes
miserable. Except that when they take their clothes off, they know
that they have little if any control over how the images of their
naked bodies _ which will then be projected onto 30-foot screens in
front of millions of complete strangers _ will ultimately be
presented.
</P>
<P>
   Rosie Perez, whose first film role, in ``Do the Right Thing,''
had such a memorable nude scene that a decade later she's still
living it down (or up), convened a round table of some of her
friends and colleagues, inviting a reporter to participate, to talk
about the pressures, rewards and plain facts about getting naked in
public.
</P>
<P>
   ROSIE PEREZ (``White Men Can't Jump,'' ``Fearless''): I
initially wanted to do this round table because of my stepdaughter,
because she told me that there was a Web site where I was nude. And
it just brought up a lot of questions, because now that I'm older
and married and I have a 14-year-old stepdaughter, and she sees me
naked on a Web site, I'm like: How am I going to respond to her? Am
I going to say, Oh that's a horrible thing? I really had to go,
Wait a minute, do I really feel good about what I did? Do I feel
embarrassed in front of her because I did those things? And then I
started reaching even further, and I remember there was a point in
my career where I actually pulled back, because everybody wanted me
to do these movies where I'm taking off my clothes and
sassafrassing around, and then I found myself covering up, and I
was like, Well, that's not me, either. ... I see explicit covers on
magazines, and they're getting even more explicit, and it's like,
Are women being empowered, or is this just what sells magazines?
Are they feeling pressured, or have they really come into
themselves and are saying, I am woman, hear me roar?
</P>
<P>
   MIM UDOVITCH: Maybe we should start by going around the room and
talking about your first, or your most memorable, experiences with
doing nude scenes.
</P>
<P>
   PEREZ: My first experience, of course, was ``Do the Right
Thing.'' And I had a big problem with it, mainly because I was
afraid of what my family would think _ that's what was really
bothering me. It wasn't really about taking off my clothes. But I
also didn't feel good about it because the atmosphere wasn't
correct. And when Spike Lee puts ice cubes on my nipples, the
reason you don't see my head is because I'm crying. I was like, I
don't want to do this. I felt like Irene Cara in ``Fame.'' It was
like, Wait a minute, I feel so wimpy, this is not who I am. So that
was my first experience, and it was horrible. But then I went and
took my clothes off again for ``White Men Can't Jump.'' But that
was because it was totally my decision, I felt totally comfortable,
the director was so cool and Woody Harrelson was like, Well,
whatever you want is cool with me. So there I felt empowered by it.
</P>
<P>
   SARAH JESSICA PARKER (``Sex and the City,'' ``State and Main''):
Well, I've never done nudity. And I don't do nudity, and for no
particular moral reason. It's not a judgment, and I'm very admiring
of those people who feel comfortable enough to do it. The irony is
that I come from a very politically progressive family. But I've
just never felt comfortable, and I've always felt that I could
convince whoever had an idea that nudity might be good in a scene
that it wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   UDOVITCH: So your contracts specify no nude scenes?
</P>
<P>
   PARKER: Yes. And now that I'm married, not that there's any kind
of dictatorship in the house, but he doesn't even really like to
see a photograph that is meant to be titillating or whatever, it
makes him feel uncomfortable. And I think I'm much more conscious
of that, too, now, like what I do at work, too, even a scene with a
bra and skirt.
</P>
<P>
   SANDRA BERNHARD (``The King of Comedy,'' ``I'm Still Here ...
Damn It''): For me, anytime I've used nudity in my work, I've
always felt strangely detached from it, and it's always been on a
lot of different levels that it's worked for me, and had sort of a
multipurpose emotional and cultural reference. So I've never felt
in any way, shape or form exploited or used, because it's always
been pretty much my decision. Even in ``King of Comedy,'' where I
stripped down for Jerry Lewis, it's such a perfect metaphor for any
woman's darkest fantasy. It's always been, I don't know, kind of a
kick for me _ having grown up being really skinny and, like, not
particularly confident, for me it's always felt really liberating.
</P>
<P>
   PEREZ: That's how I felt for ``White Men Can't Jump.''
</P>
<P>
   BERNHARD: But you're a little bit more bodacious than I am, so
I'm sure your whole life you've kind of been looked at in a much
more sexual way, and ogled. Also, when you do comedy, you're
usually alone onstage, so you're calling the shots. ... And in
terms of my own daughter, we kind of always wander around naked
together, so it's pretty open and relaxed. I think it's something I
missed growing up.
</P>
<P>
   SARITA CHOUDHURY (``Mississippi Masala,'' ``Kama Sutra''): My
first time nude was with a woman director, so I thought it would be
easy, but it wasn't. I got my period just before.
</P>
<P>
   DEBI MAZAR (``Goodfellas,'' ``The Insider''): Me, too!
</P>
<P>
   CHOUDHURY: Really? And so I didn't want to come down from the
room _ it was horrific. Usually, though, I feel really comfortable
during the scene, and then I hate it when the movie is going to
come out. My family is conservative, and that is hard. I don't know
why it's so liberating when I'm doing it and then ...
</P>
<P>
   PEREZ: It's funny. With family I don't know what to say anymore.
My father calls, and he says: ``Hello, baby! Do I see this one?''
``No.'' ``OK, bye!''
</P>
<P>
   AMBER VALLETTA (``What Lies Beneath,'' ``Drop Back Ten''): Well,
none of the films I've done were nude. But one of the first
modeling jobs I got that was big, that was a break, I got for
French Elle _ and in France nudity is not a big deal. I went on the
job because one of the two models got sick, and the other one was
Claudia Schiffer. Obviously I was kind of the nobody, so she got
all the work _ it was a week in the Seychelles, and they were like,
Well, we'll shoot a couple covers on you when we get a chance. I
was 17, maybe 18, and they asked me to take off my top for one of
these pictures. And the picture is of me like this (crosses arms
over breasts and freezes) and I look so uncomfortable. I had never
taken off my clothes for a photographer before, and he was
particularly mean, he was very macho, and it didn't make it any
easier. ... And since then I have done a few nude pictures and I'm
very, very careful about it _ like I know the number of nude
pictures that are out. But then there are runway photos that are on
the Internet. This one kid came up to me and said, ``Can you sign
this?'' And I looked, and it was a totally sheer top _ you could
see my breasts like it was broad daylight. And you just never
think, because it's for a fashion show, that those pictures might
get cut for _
</P>
<P>
   MAZAR: ``Celebrity Skin.''
</P>
<P>
   PEREZ: That was the Web site!
</P>
<P>
   VALLETTA: Actually, I've seen it twice now, so now I'm even
careful on runways, but sometimes you just say, ``I don't care, I
feel good.'' But the first one was definitely uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   UDOVITCH: The difference maybe is you're in a position now where
you can say no, and before you really _
</P>
<P>
   VALLETTA: I couldn't. I was trying to do a job, and I was with a
model who was already made, and she was going to do the picture if
I wasn't probably, and maybe not naked, but it would have been one
more for her and one less for me. And when you're young and naive
... it's not that you're not given a choice, but you maybe don't
know what your choices are.
</P>
<P>
   UDOVITCH: Everyone has said that power is an issue. Sandra has
said she's the most comfortable, and she's the one who has the most
power over what she does.
</P>
<P>
   MAZAR: For me, I basically had hippie parents, and I've always
been a very sexual person and OK with people seeing my body _ so my
first experience being naked, I gave full nudity. I read it, I
discussed it with the director, we discussed how we were going to
shoot it, it was going to be very Bu$uel-like, starting with the
tip of my heel, and we had it all mapped out, and I felt, Wow, this
is going to be really cool. It was my first big studio lead. It was
called ``Money for Nothing.'' It had John Cusack, Benicio Del Toro,
all these great actors. And then, at the end of the day, it was
completely gratuitous, like they just showed me sitting on him,
frontal. ... Now with love scenes, often if I read a script and I
don't trust a director, I have a clause, no nudity.
</P>
<P>
   PEREZ: That's something that's really bizarre, when you get to
that point in the Hollywood system where you have to negotiate
certain body parts.
</P>
<P>
   CHOUDHURY: Oh, completely! It's absurd!
</P>
<P>
   PEREZ: It's like, No below nipple, no crotch shot, only side, no
frontal, or in the frontal, only stomach _
</P>
<P>
   MAZAR: And no crack. Mm-hmm.
</P>
<P>
   PEREZ: Right, no crack. They literally have these terms, and you
sit there thinking, What the hell is going on? It drives me crazy
to the point where I want to say, ``No, you can't show nothing,''
not because I don't believe in it, but because it's so absurd.
</P>
<P>
   PARKER: It's worth noting that we feel we need protection with
this, whereas everything else that we're told as women of a certain
generation is, We are as good, we're equal, we can have the whole
thing, and we still feel we need somebody, a manager or an agent or
a big, burly somebody, to say no.
</P>
<P>
   UDOVITCH: But then some women who have chosen to take their
clothes off, and examples that spring to mind are Demi Moore,
Madonna, Elizabeth Berkley, obviously a big range of performers
doing very different kinds of work, but they were all clobbered, in
a way that it's hard to believe anybody deserves for anything they
do in entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   MAZAR: Did it hurt them? No.
</P>
<P>
   PARKER: I think it hurt Elizabeth Berkley.
</P>
<P>
   CHOUDHURY: I think it hurt Demi Moore. I think it hurt her big
time.
</P>
<P>
   UDOVITCH: I think it hurt Madonna in the short term also.
</P>
<P>
   PARKER: Perhaps it's not fair to prognosticate about Elizabeth
Berkley, but it's an easy example in a way. I looked at
``Showgirls,'' and although I don't know what she was thinking,
what it felt like in the audience was, she wanted to be in a big
movie, and it wasn't good, the script wasn't good. But look how
different Gina Gershon was _ she seeemd very self-aware and ironic.
</P>
<P>
   UDOVITCH: I think Elizabeth Berkley was different in that she
was very young, and she just did what the director told her, and as
it happened, it didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   PEREZ (to Bernhard): What's the matter? Do you not agree, lady?
</P>
<P>
   BERNHARD: Nothing's the matter. I have nothing to say about
``Showgirls.'' I just think it's a campy, funny film, and I think
anybody in that role would have probably been in the same position.
...
</P>
<P>
   MAZAR: I went in to audition on that movie. I knew it was
(expletive) when I read it, and I thought, Man, I'll go in, and
I'll work it, I'll use my sexuality because I can.
</P>
<P>
   BERNHARD: Did you go in for Gina's role?
</P>
<P>
   MAZAR: Yeah. And when I walk into an audition, I do use my
sexuality to get a part, to put it out there, to convince them.
</P>
<P>
   BERNHARD: If you're going in and using your sexuality to get a
part, how can you ever get offended if they want you to be nude?
</P>
<P>
   MAZAR: I don't. But I decide when I get exploited now.
</P>
<P>
   BERNHARD: That's fair.
</P>
<P>
   PEREZ: I think one of the best examples of nudity I've seen
women do in movies is ``Blue Velvet,'' when home-chick came out on
the lawn and she's naked. That was where I thought nudity was so
appropriate, because this man tormented her and drove her to the
point of insanity, so when she walked out on the lawn, you weren't
saying to yourself, Oh, my God, Isabella Rossellini's naked, you
were saying, Oh, my God, she's finally flipped out, you're so
concentrated on her character.
</P>
<P>
   UDOVITCH: Another thing about Isabella Rossellini in ``Blue
Velvet'' is that she looked great when she came out naked, even
completely tormented, but what she also looked like was like an
un-worked-out body, and at that time, in 1986, you never saw that.
In the '80s, after Madonna got worked out, all the standards
changed. Because if you see '60s beach movies, those girls are
pretty, but they have thighs, their stomachs aren't flat and you
never see that anymore.
</P>
<P>
   BERNHARD: Or if you see any of Russ Meyer's films.
</P>
<P>
   PARKER: It's funny because I always think how beautiful Isabella
Rossellini is, and another person I always think of who's that
beautiful is her mother. And her mother was like, a Woman. It's
like, Oh, maybe someday I'll be a woman. She's just like flesh, and
sexy!
</P>
<P>
   BERNHARD: You better start eating, honey. You got a long way to
go.
</P>
<P>
   UDOVITCH: Did anyone see Kate Winslet in ``Holy Smoke''? She has
a normal body, and she's beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   PARKER: I love her.
</P>
<P>
   PEREZ: But talking about Madonna, the sculptured body, nudity
and sexuality, I feel so much pressure to stay small. And as you
get older, it gets a little bit harder, and I love to eat. And when
you go to Los Angeles, when you go on interviews and auditions, the
first thing they look at is your chest and your hips _ they want to
see how good your body is.
</P>
<P>
   MAZAR: I got prosthetic breasts, I got three sets. I got the
chicken cutlets for the normal size _ these are all for mastectomy
patients _ and then I got the next size, and then I got the nursing
size, and I use them to create different shapes of body depending
on the character, because sometimes I'll just figure out a way to
not take my top off if I get the movie. But to get it, sometimes I
walk in with these huge prosthetic breasts and big sweaters,
because you know, you get a whole other body language.
</P>
<P>
   CHOUDHURY: I liked Rosie's ice cube scene in ``Do the Right
Thing.''
</P>
<P>
   BERNHARD: But she was saying just before you got here that it
made her cry when she was doing it.
</P>
<P>
   CHOUDHURY: But I liked your body, because I have breasts, so I
was like, Oh, yeah. I was just comforted because there weren't many
girls with that build.
</P>
<P>
   UDOVITCH: I'm curious _ does anyone disdain people who choose to
augment their bodies?
</P>
<P>
   PARKER: It doesn't bother me. Also, you don't like to rule
anything out. I mean, I'd like to think I wouldn't do that, but
who's to say? It's different for women, we have this window,
certainly more in the movie business than in the theater, and even
in television it's probably a little better than in the movies. I
feel like I have this window in the movie industry, and it closes a
little bit every day, and I'm now one of these people who talk
about all these young people _ Who are they? Where are they coming
from? _ and they're all on the magazines. ... So when I think about
plastic surgery, I think, Well ... maybe it keeps the window open a
little longer.

 By JEFFREY GOLDBERG  
 c.2000 The New York Times Magazine  
<TEXT>
<P>
   About two hours east of the Khyber Pass, in the North-West
Frontier Province of Pakistan, alongside the Grand Trunk Road, sits
a school called the Haqqania madrasa. A madrasa is a Muslim
religious seminary, and Haqqania is one of the bigger madrasas in
Pakistan: the school currently enrolls more than 2,800 students.
Tuition, room and board are free; the students are, in the main,
drawn from the dire poor, and the madrasa raises its funds from
wealthy Pakistanis, as well as from devout, and politically minded,
Muslims in the countries of the Persian Gulf. The students range in
age from 8 and 9 to 30, sometimes to 35.
</P>
<P>
   In a typical class, the teachers sit on the floor with the boys,
reading to them in Arabic, and the boys repeat what the teachers
say. This can go on between four and eight hours each day. What
Westerners would think of as high-school-age and college-age
students are enrolled in an eight-year course of study that focuses
on interpretation of the Koran and of the Hadith, the sayings of
the Prophet Muhammad.
</P>
<P>
   Very few of the students at the Haqqania madrasa study anything
but Islamic subjects. There are no world history courses, or math
courses, or computer rooms or science labs at the madrasa. The
Haqqania madrasa is, in fact, a jihad factory. This does not make
it unique in Pakistan. There are one million students studying in
the country's 10,000 or so madrasas, and militant Islam is at the
core of most of these schools.
</P>
<P>
   Haqqania is notable not only because of its size, but also
because it has graduated more leaders of the Taliban, Afghanistan's
ruling faction, than any other school in the world, including any
school in Afghanistan. The Taliban is today known the world over
for its harsh interpretation of Islamic law, its cruelty to women
and its kindness to terrorists _ the most notable one being Osama
bin Laden, the 42-year-old Saudi exile who the American government
believes was behind the bombings two years ago of the United States
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. The Taliban also seems to harbor a
deep belief in the notion of a never-ending jihad, which makes the
Haqqania madrasa a focus of intense interest in such capitals as
Washington and Moscow and New Delhi and Jerusalem, where the
experts are trying to understand just what it is the Taliban and
its sympathizers want.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of Haqqania students come from Pakistan itself, a
fact that also worries officials in Washington and Moscow and New
Delhi and Jerusalem. Pakistan's Islamists are becoming more and
more radicalized _ ``Talibanized,'' some call it _ thanks in part
to madrasas like Haqqania, and Pakistan is showing early signs of
coming apart at the seams. Pakistan also happens to be in
possession of nuclear weapons. Many Muslim radicals say they
believe these weapons should become part of the arsenal of jihad.
It turns out that many of the Haqqania students, under careful
tutelage, now believe it, too.
</P>
<P>
   It is for all these reasons that on a hazy morning in March, I
presented myself at the office of the chancellor of the madrasa, a
mullah named Samiul Haq, in order to enroll myself in his school.
My goal was simple: I wanted to see from the inside just what this
jihad factory was producing. The chancellor is a friend and
supporter of bin Laden, and he has granted an honorary degree _ the
first and only in his school's history _ to Mullah Omar, the
Taliban leader. Samiul Haq is also a politician, a former senator
who today leads a faction of the Jamiat-Ulema-Islami, the JUI, a
radical Islamic party seeking to impose Shariah, or Islamic law, in
Pakistan. The maulana, it is said, would like to see Pakistan
become more like the Afghanistan of his Taliban disciples.
</P>
<P>
   The maulana is a man of 65. He has two wives and eight children,
he told me, and he seemed, right from the start, a very happy man.
He dispensed with small talk almost immediately, in order to let me
know that I should feel at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem,'' he told me, through an interpreter, ``is not
between us Muslims and Christians.'' I knew where this was going,
but stayed silent. ``The only enemy Islam and Christianity have is
the Jews,'' he said. ``It was the Jews who crucified Christ, you
know. The Jews are using America to fight Islam. Clinton is a good
man, but he's surrounded by Jews. Madeleine Albright's father was
the founder of Zionism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm Jewish,'' I told him. There was a moment's pause.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, you are most welcome here,'' he said. And so I was. The
maulana made me an offer: I could spend as much time as I wanted at
the madrasa, go wherever I wanted, talk to anybody I chose, even
study the Koran with him. He had a point he wanted to make, of
course: his madrasa might be Taliban U., but it was not a training
camp for terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Strictly speaking, Haq was right: I never saw a weapon at the
Haqqania madrasa. The closest guns could be found across the Grand
Trunk Road, at the Khyber Pass Armaments Co., a gun store that
sells shotguns for $40 and AK-47s for $70. And I never heard a
lecture about bomb making or marksmanship. On the other hand, when
the Taliban was faring badly not long ago in battle against the
northern alliance _ the holdout foe of the Taliban in Afghanistan's
seemingly endless civil war _ Haq closed down his school and sent
the students to the front. (He would not tell me how many never
came back from the front.)
</P>
<P>
   Classrooms were full when I visited Haqqania this spring. There
were no TVs, no radios that I could see. The students woke up
before dawn, to pray in the madrasa's mosque. The dormitories were
threadbare and filthy, and there was no cafeteria, per se: students
lined up at the kitchen with their plates and spoons and were fed
rice and curries and nan, the flat Afghan bread.
</P>
<P>
   Suffice it to say, the students at the madrasa almost never see
women. There were no female teachers, no female cafeteria workers,
no female presence whatsoever at the madrasa. There is no such
thing as parents' day, or family day, when mothers and fathers and
sisters and brothers come to visit.
</P>
<P>
   The youngest students interested me particularly. They had not
yet been armored in the hard-casing of jihadist ideology, and yet
they seemed to incorporate the politics of the madrasa into their
play. Two 11-year-old boys, both Afghan refugees who came to the
school from Peshawar, would follow me around wherever I went. They
wore pots on their heads, and their version of hide-and-seek was to
jump out from behind a tree or some other hiding place, scream
``Osama!'' and pretend to shoot me.
</P>
<P>
   I tried to learn what I could about these boys, but they were
reticent. And my minders _ there was usually someone from Samiul
Haq's office with me, listening in on my conversations _ didn't
want me probing too deeply into how boys came to be students at the
madrasa. The youngest boys were kept under lock and key, in a
three-story dormitory guarded by older students, and I wasn't
allowed to see how they lived.
</P>
<P>
   The two 11-year-olds were refugees, I eventually learned.
Compared to a refugee camp, the madrasa is a palace, and they are
blessed to be here, where they eat food every single day. No one
else _ certainly not the government of Pakistan _ would provide
them with an education, room and board. During the school day, I
would make a special point of auditing classes in which the Hadith
was studied, because so much of Islamic thought is found in the
Hadith, and also because the Hadith has traditionally been
understood to be a text open to interpretation, argument and
rigorous intellectual inquiry. But such is not the case at the
Haqqania madrasa.
</P>
<P>
   In the classes I attended, even the high-level classes, the
pattern was generally the same: a teacher, generally an ancient,
white-bearded mullah, would read straight from a text, and the
students would listen. There was no back and forth. It seemed as if
rote learning was the madrasa's only style of learning.
</P>
<P>
   After a time, I began to be asked questions during classes,
questions about America and about my views. One day, in a class
devoted to passages in the Hadith concerning zakat, or charity, I
was asked my views about Osama bin Laden. Why did America have it
in for him? It is unsettling, to say the least, to be seated in a
class being held in a mosque, led by a mullah, and attended by some
200 barefoot and turbaned students, and be asked such a question.
</P>
<P>
   I began by saying that bin Laden's program violates a basic
tenet of Islam, which holds that even in a jihad the lives of
innocent people must be spared. A jihad is a war against
combatants, not women and children. I read to them an appropriate
saying of the Prophet Muhammad (I came armed with the Hadith): ``It
is narrated by Ibn Umar that a woman was found killed in one of
these battles, so the Messenger of Allah, may peace be upon him,
forbade the killing of women and children.''
</P>
<P>
   They did not like the idea of me quoting the Prophet to them,
and they began chanting, ``Osama, Osama, Osama.'' When they calmed
down, they took turns defending bin Laden. ``Osama bin Laden is a
great Muslim,'' a student named Wali said. ``The West is afraid of
strong Muslims, so they made him their enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the students had turned this day's class into a political
seminar of sorts, I decided to ask a question of my own. I brought
up the subject of Pakistan's nuclear bomb. I asked the students if
they thought it would be permissible, by the law of Islam, to use a
nuclear bomb during the prosecution of a jihad.
</P>
<P>
   ``All things come from Allah,'' one student said. ``The atomic
bomb comes from Allah, so it should be used.'' I then asked: Who
wants to see Osama bin Laden armed with nuclear weapons? Every hand
in the room shot up. The students laughed, and some applauded.
</P>
<P>
   But, I said, innocent people would inevitably die if the bomb
was used. Even if the West, or Russia, is subjugating Muslims, does
that give bin Laden and his supporters the right to kill innocent
people?
</P>
<P>
   ``Osama has never killed anybody innocent,'' one student, whose
name was Ghazi, answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if you were shown proof that he did?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Americans say they have proof, but they don't give it to
the Taliban.''
</P>
<P>
   I then presented a hypothetical scenario. ``What if,'' I asked,
``you were shown a video in which Osama bin Laden was actually seen
murdering a woman. What then?''
</P>
<P>
   There was a pause. A student named Fazlur Razaq stood up: ``The
Americans have all the tricks of the media. They can put Osama's
head on the body of someone else, and make it seem like he's
killing when he's not doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   I then took from my notebook my secret weapon: the 1998 fatwa
issued by bin Laden's organization _ the International Islamic
Front for Jihad Against Jews and Crusaders _ concerning the
presence of American troops in Saudi Arabia. I read them a passage,
the English translation of which reads as follows: ``The ruling to
kill the Americans and their allies _ civilians and military _ is
an individual duty for every Muslim who can do it in any country in
which it is possible to do it, in order to liberate the Al Aksa
Mosque and the holy mosque from their grip, and in order for their
armies to move out of all the lands of Islam, defeated and unable
to threaten any Muslim.''
</P>
<P>
   Here it is, I said, in black and white: bin Laden calling for
the death of all Americans, civilian and military.
</P>
<P>
   ``Osama didn't write that,'' one student yelled, and the others
cheered. ``That's a forgery of the Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   I asked one final question: What would you do if you learned
that the CIA had captured bin Laden and was taking him to America
to stand trial? A student who gave his name as Muhammad stood up:
``We would sacrifice our lives for Osama. We would kill
Americans.'' What kind of Americans? ``All Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   As I left the mosque, Muhammad and a group of his friends
approached me. ``We'd like you to embrace Islam,'' he said. ``We
love you. We want you to have Islam.''
</P>
<P>
   Later that day, I met with a small group of students I had grown
to like, hoping that, away from their teachers, they would talk a
different talk. Meeting students out of class had already made for
a number of interesting moments: I had, for example, been asked for
sex. Many of them were convinced that all Americans are bisexual,
and that Westerners engage in sex with anything, anywhere, all the
time.
</P>
<P>
   Among the young men I spoke with after the Osama colloquy there
was no talk of sex. One, a bright and personable student from a
village near Kabul, had told me his name was Sayid. I asked him how
his parents felt to have him at the madrasa, knowing that there is
a chance he would choose to be a mujahed _ against the northern
alliance, or perhaps against India, in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   ``They support the jihad,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``How would they feel if you were killed?''
</P>
<P>
   ``They would be very happy,'' he said. ``They would be so proud.
Any father would want his son to die as shaheed,'' or martyr.
</P>
<P>
   If you fought against the northern alliance, you would be
killing Muslims, I said. ``They're Muslims, but they're crazy,''
Sayid replied.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of days later, I was due in Islamabad, the capital, for
a birthday party, and it was quite a party. A big cake, lots of
speeches, lots of dignitaries, including Gen. Pervez Musharraf, the
``chief executive'' of Pakistan, which is the title he took when
the Pakistani Army overthrew the elected government in October and
installed him as maximum leader. Written in lemon frosting across
the length of the cake were the words, ``Second Anniversary
Celebrations of Youm-e-Takbeer.''
</P>
<P>
   Youm-e-Takbeer can be translated as ``the day of God's
greatness,'' and in Pakistan it refers to May 28, 1998, the day
Pakistan first exploded a nuclear bomb. The birthday party, under
the auspices of Pakistan's military leader, was a birthday party
for the bomb. ``We bow our heads to Allah almighty for restoring
greatness to Pakistan on May 28, 1998,'' proclaimed the science
minister of Pakistan, Atta-ur-Rahman, at the outset of the official
program.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of days after the party, I went to Rawalpindi, next
door to Islamabad, because I'd been given the chance to talk with
Musharraf. We met one morning at Army House, the residence of the
Pakistani army's chief of staff. (Musharraf has chosen not to take
up residence in the prime minister's house, even though he has
functioned as prime minister since October.) During our
conversation, I asked Musharraf if the West should worry that
fundamentalist Muslims, in or out of the army, might get hold of
Pakistan's nuclear weapons. (In Pentagon exercises, American
war-gamers have mapped out a scenario in which Taliban-like
extremists gain control of Pakistan's atomic arsenal during a
violent break-up of the country.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely implausible,'' Musharaff said. ``There is no
question of that happening. There is no question of nuclear
material falling into the hands of irresponsible people at all.'' I
made mention of the religious overtones of the Youm-e-Takbeer
celebration, particularly the science minister's remarks, saying
that Westerners are discomforted by the belief that God is the
founder of Pakistan's nuclear weapons program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, we do use the term 'Allah's will,' '' he said. ``We do
consider God to be the supreme sovereign, and we do consider
ourselves to be his representatives on earth. We being his
representatives on earth, whatever has to be done is according to
the teaching of Allah. But when we say 'the will of God,' that
doesn't mean we aren't using our brains, that we are trigger-happy
fundamentalists.''
</P>
<P>
   Musharraf is not thought of as an Islamic fundamentalist. He is
known to have progressive views on the rights of women, for
example. And yet he can sound very much like an Islamic
fundamentalist at times. I asked the general if he believed bin
Laden to be a terrorist. ``If at all he's involved in planning or
conducting bombings or hijackings, he's a terrorist.''
</P>
<P>
   I then asked him if he doubted American claims that bin Laden is
a terrorist. ``The Taliban has a stand on this subject. They say
they need proof, which has not been given to them. We have asked
for proof from the U.S. and we are in the process of getting this.
From the legal point of view, I haven't seen the proof.''
</P>
<P>
   For Samiul Haq, the world is divided into two separate and
mutually hostile domains: the dar-al-harb and the dar-al-Islam. The
dar-al-harb is the ``abode of war.'' The dar-al-Islam is the
``abode of peace.'' In the 1980s, the Soviet Union epitomized, for
fundamentalist-minded Muslims, the abode of war. Today, it is the
U.S. that symbolizes the dar-al-harb. How this came to pass, how
America, which supported _ created, some would say _ the jihad
movement against the Soviets, came to become the No. 1 enemy of
hard-core Islamists is one of the more vexing questions facing
American policy makers and the leaders of a dozen Muslim countries
today.
</P>
<P>
   One school of thought, Samiul Haq's school, says it's the
Americans' fault: American imperialism and the export of American
social and sexual mores are to blame. The other school of thought
holds that Islam, by its very nature, is in permanent competition
with other civilizations. This is the theory expounded by the
Harvard political scientist Samuel Huntington, who coined the term
``Islam's bloody borders'' _ a reference to the fact that wherever
Islam rubs up against other civilizations _ Jewish, Christian,
Hindu _ wars seem to break out. Men like Samiul Haq deride this
view, and yet, in their black-and-white world, Islam stands alone
against the world's infidels: Christians (or ``Crusaders,'' in the
fundamentalist parlance) to be sure, but Jews and Hindus
especially. In Haq's view, the West is implacably hostile to the
message of Islam, and so the need to prepare for jihad is
never-ending.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jihad'' is a concept widely misunderstood in the West. It does
not mean only ``holy war.'' It essentially means ``struggle,'' and
according to the traditional understanding of Islam, there are two
types of jihad: greater and lesser. ``Greater Jihad,'' is the
struggle within the soul of a person to be better, more righteous _
the fight against the devil within. ``Lesser Jihad'' is the fight
against the devil without: the military struggle against those who
subjugate Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever I meet a Muslim fundamentalist, I ask them the same
stupid-sounding question: Which is more important to Islam, greater
jihad or lesser jihad? The answer, usually accompanied by an
indulgent look, is usually something like, ``They don't call it
'greater jihad' for nothing.'' The struggle against the external
oppressor waxes and wanes, but the fight to suppress the evil
inclinations within is perpetual.
</P>
<P>
   But in my conversations with Haq, and with mullahs across
Pakistan and Afghanistan, I kept getting a different answer. ``They
are of equal importance,'' Haq said. ``Jihad against the oppressor
of Muslims is an absolute duty. Islam is a religion that defends
itself.'' Jihad against the devil without has assumed a place of
permanent, even overriding importance in the way these mullahs look
at the world. This was surprising to me, because not even the
leaders of Hamas in the Gaza Strip, or sympathizers of the Muslim
Brotherhood in Egypt, ever answered the question this way.
</P>
<P>
   I asked him if this is what he is teaching his thousands of
students. ``My students are taught Islam. This isn't a military
school.''
</P>
<P>
   Haq's secret was not that the Haqqania madrasa is a training
camp for terrorists. The secret is embodied in the two 11-year-olds
cocking their fingers at me, and in the taunts of the students in
the mosque who raised their hands for Osama bin Laden, and in the
hundreds of thousands of young men at madrasas across Pakistan and
Afghanistan. These are poor and impressionable boys kept entirely
ignorant of the world and, for that matter, largely ignorant of all
but one interpretation of Islam. They are the perfect jihad
machines.

Saint-Exupery is fast approaching. This ``separate-buy'' article

 By STACY SCHIFF
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rarely have an author and a character been so intimately bound
together as Antoine de Saint-Exupery and his Little Prince. They
make for an odd couple: the hulking, balding aviator who preferred
stapling to buttoning his shirts; the dapper little
extraterrestrial with the mop of golden curls and what seems an
extensive wardrobe for someone who hails from an asteroid the size
of a house. Where the Little Prince religiously tends his planet,
his creator was a champion procrastinator. (If the wreckage found
off the coast of Marseille this spring, weeks before
Saint-Exupery's centennial on June 29, proves to be that of his
lost World War II airplane, it will be one of the first occasions
on which he has turned up on time.) The Little Prince is a
determined walker; Saint-Exupery _ the toast of every cabdriver in
Paris _ was allergic to exercise. He had no use for nature. Yet the
two remain tangled together, twin innocents who fell from the sky.
</P>
<P>
   It was not always so. Reviewers of 1943 assumed the novel's
narrator _ the downed pilot who befriends the Little Prince and
elicits the story of his travels _ was Saint-Exupery. This was as
much the publisher's doing as anything else; the oddball volume was
advertised everywhere as ``a story of St. Exupery and the desert.''
Inadvertently the author assisted in the conflation; in its April
26, 1943, issue, Time reported that he had ``last fortnight left
the U.S. for active service against the Axis in Africa.'' Weeks
later, after having bent a few rules, and to his immense
satisfaction, he began flying again with his old reconnaissance
squadron. His publisher celebrated with a press release, one that
ended in a postscript: ``Although he is in the general neighborhood
where the Little Prince appeared to him, he has not seen him
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Saint-Exupery's friends saw a good deal of the Little Prince,
however. The author waved the book around proudly, boyishly, as if
handing over a kind of personal manifesto. He demanded reader's
reports from those who asked to borrow a precious copy. (The volume
was not published in occupied France, where all of Saint-Exupery
had fallen out of print, and was banned in North Africa.) His
letters are punctuated with versions of the flying figure, soon
grounded and disconsolate, as Saint-Exupery was himself to be,
having clumsily damaged an $80,000 airplane in the middle of a war.
</P>
<P>
   Only in the spring of 1944 did he manage to talk his way back
into active service, in a plane into which he did not fit, that he
could not comfortably fly, communicating with the control tower in
a language he did not speak. Over the next months he knew every
kind of near disaster. He experienced engine trouble and landing
difficulties, he fainted in flight, he was pursued by enemy
aircraft, he battled a fire on board. Any one of his 1944 missions
could have been his last.
</P>
<P>
   On July 31, 1944, he disappeared, under circumstances upon which
has swelled a great grassy knoll of literature. In much the same
fashion as the Little Prince, Saint-Exupery vanished into thin air.
This was enough to assure his legend. (Insofar as he died for his
country, his was also a death that extended the French copyrights
in his work for an additional 30 years.) ``The Little Prince'' read
differently in France in 1945, where it was published after the
liberation, than it had in America in 1943; to the French reader it
amounted to an eerie chronicle of a death foretold. The mystery
surrounding the disappearance has only enhanced the myth. From the
Titanic to the Loch Ness monster, we cannot resist the appeal of
the large object that slips suddenly from view.
</P>
<P>
   Clinching the equation of author and character, beckoning to the
mystic interpreters, is the curious matter of the sunsets.
Saint-Exupery met his end weeks after his 44th birthday. The Little
Prince lives on a planet so small that he is able to watch the sun
set 44 times a day. Case closed for the suicide contingent. There
is only one small problem. The Little Prince indeed witnesses 44
sunsets in the Katherine Woods rendering, as it seems he will
continue to do in Richard Howard's sparkling new translation of the
novel, published this month. But in French the sun fades from the
Little Prince's view as it always has: 43 times.
</P>
<P>
   Books have lives _ ``The Little Prince'' has had at least two,
and on the occasion this week of Saint-Exupery's centenary is about
to enjoy another _ and they have legacies. As J.M. Barrie's massive
oeuvre has been eclipsed by the shadow of Peter Pan, so has
Saint-Exupery dissolved largely into the author of a children's
classic. The volume has been as kind to his royalty account as it
has been detrimental to his reputation; the successful children's
book writer is one of those thankless half-breeds, like the
academic celebrity, the child star.
</P>
<P>
   Saint-Exupery's fall from literary grace begins with ``The
Little Prince'' in his native country, where he is the Norman
Rockwell of letters. His offenses are legion. As one French
apologist has it: ``He manages to eschew Cartesian thinking, to
sidestep the subtlety of our rhetoricians, to rise above our
Talmudic taste for criticism _ in short, to escape all of our
national vices.'' Most maddeningly, Saint-Exupery refuses to
subscribe to schools; he slips through nets. This was, after all, a
writer who won both the Academie Francaise's fiction prize and the
American Booksellers Association's nonfiction prize for ``Wind,
Sand and Stars,'' who got himself condemned as a Vichyite and
banned for singing the praises of a Jew all at once.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing is perfect,'' sighs the Little Prince's fox, trading
on his creator's wisdom. Even on a good day the road to immortality
has been as convoluted for Saint-Exupery as was the mortal one. In
1992 the Banque de France resolved to feature an aviator on one of
its new bills. A poll was conducted; France's most celebrated flier
was determined to be Jean Mermoz. Mermoz was a stellar and
unflappable pilot, a better pilot than Saint-Exupery, but he also
happened to have a few unfortunate ideas about fascism. Under a
Socialist administration he hardly qualified as banknote material.
Saint-Exupery profited from his disaster and today graces the
50-franc note by default. Which did not guarantee that his name
would be spelled correctly on the original issue of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Just as each generation embraces its favorite flier, so have we
had several Saint-Exuperys. This is not surprising; for years the
French biography of record was Pierre Chevrier's 1949 ``Antoine de
Saint-Exupery,'' a volume beside which Edmund Morris' ``Dutch''
looks slavishly literal. Pierre Chevrier was none other than Nelly
de Voge, Saint-Exupery's longtime mistress. Dashing into a phone
booth, she emerges as ``un ami'' whenever she needs to enter her
text. Needless to say, Saint-Exupery's wife, Consuelo, is mentioned
only in passing.
</P>
<P>
   Posthumously, Mme. de Saint-Exupery is enjoying her revenge.
Reworked by a critic, her memoirs _ bearing the seductive belly
band ``Le Manuscrit Retrouve de la Femme de Saint-Exupery'' _ have
become a best seller in France. (They were not so much recovered as
finally released by her executor, who _ appropriately for the woman
who advertised herself as the model for the Little Prince's
melodramatic rose _ happened also to be her gardener.)
</P>
<P>
   Consuelo's pages ``topple the statue of our hero, supplying
damning evidence for the prosecution,'' trumpeted L'Express,
although the ``memoir'' reveals very little that is new. A portrait
of marital bliss was not to be expected from the party whom
Saint-Exupery crisply informed, ``If you're not here I can't think,
and if you talk I can't write.'' Two additional volumes devoted to
Consuelo join her own in Parisian bookstores this month. Both take
as their basis the idea that ``The Little Prince'' is the story of
a man's struggle with his marriage, which it is, every bit as much
as it is a volume that read backward reveals that the Lindbergh
baby was acting alone in Roswell.
</P>
<P>
   As always, the other shoes drop slowly. Now we have Consuelo,
but sometime down the road we will have another piece of the story,
the intoxicating love letters Saint-Exupery wrote Nelly de Voge.
(``They will not be published until after you are dead,'' she
informed this biographer, 45 years her junior.) Additional
documents will reframe that publication; the man who expounded so
eloquently on duty was perfectly capable of confessing his love to
two different women on the same afternoon. All the same, a
consistent image emerges. ``Pierre Chevrier'' tells of
Saint-Exupery having forced Benzedrine down her throat so that she
might read his new pages with unflagging attention. What should our
hero do in the course of his first evening with Consuelo but ply
her with sedatives? Small wonder the man has not often been allowed
to venture out with a biographer unchaperoned.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, Saint-Exupery's heirs have sought to protect him from
the indignity of a barnacle-encrusted P-38 rising from the ocean.
Can the myth survive the solution to the riddle of Saint-Exupery's
death? What happens when his fate and the Little Prince's no longer
coincide? Does the book lose its allure, in all the 95 languages in
which it is published? Once again we are on the verge of answering
those questions.

   The identity bracelet fished from an inlet off Marseille in 1998
appears to be authentic; the airplane parts currently under
investigation turned up only a mile away. Saint-Exupery may not
slip through the net this time. All the same, the question of how
he went down may never be solved; it is highly improbable that he
was shot from the sky. It seems that the essential will remain
invisible to the eye, and Saint-Exupery will remain as maddeningly,
irresistibly elusive as ever.

PRAYER DECISION LEAVES QUESTIONS, NOT INDIGNATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Supreme Court decision handed down earlier this week
limiting prayer in the nation's public schools would have left me
deflated as recently as a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   But today, thanks to my own struggles _ personal and spiritual _
I don't feel that way. My mind is filled with the words of this
passage from the eighth chapter of Romans:
</P>
<P>
   ``And we know that all things work together for good to them
that love God, to them who are the called according to his
purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   And so I'm simply reminded that God is in control.
</P>
<P>
   Even six months ago I might have cursed the justices' decision,
would've joined the chorus of voices lamenting the moral state of
our society and the need for more prayer, particularly in our
schools. Instead, I hold fast to the fact that nothing in the
universe happens, has ever happened, except when God allows it.
</P>
<P>
   That might be a difficult truth to accept if you're of the mind
that what just occurred was tragic, that being good and perfect,
God could not possibly allow such a decision when we're clearly
admonished to acknowledge him ``in all our ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends of mine who could not care less about prayer or praying
have noted that God could not care less about the outcome of a
sporting event.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe my friends are right. Maybe what God really cares about is
not the score but how we win; not how high we climb the corporate
ladder but how we treat the people we meet on our way up; whether
we took the time to acknowledge him in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   I'm reminded of the message of the Roman centurion in the book
of Luke, the subject of my Sunday school lesson on Father's Day.
</P>
<P>
   As the story goes, the centurion was a man of authority, the
commander of a hundred soldiers. If he told one of them to go, they
went. If he told one to come, he came. And if he told another to
``do this,'' he did it.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, the story said, when he wanted Jesus to heal his
servant, he didn't let his status keep him from admitting he needed
Jesus' help.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that's all prayer is, admitting we need God to
accomplish life's goals, no matter how big or small we are or how
big or small the problem is.
</P>
<P>
   What I know from personal experience is that when I pray and
truly turn my fears and problems over to God, he answers. Sometimes
the answer is immediate and definitive, and other times I've had to
teeter between uncertainty and impatiently waiting.
</P>
<P>
   But over and over again, God has proved his faithfulness and is
still working things to my good. That's hard to see when you're
hurting, when you feel like the world is against you. And depending
on your vantage point, it can be difficult to see God's hand in
last Monday's Supreme Court ruling regarding school-sanctioned
prayer.
</P>
<P>
   I can't explain it. God's thoughts are higher than mine. He
tells us clearly, for instance, in Deuteronomy 29:29 that, ``The
secret things belong unto the Lord our God.''
</P>
<P>
   Many people, particularly Christians, see the Supreme Court's
ruling as nothing more than hostility toward religion. I see it as
another way for him to get our attention, to make good on his
promises.
</P>
<P>
   In that sense, the court's ruling isn't a curse at all. It's a
blessing.

   GROUPS FEAR INTERNET BECOMING ``VIRTUAL GUN SHOW''
</P>
<P>
   For Use Sun. June 25 And Thereafter.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   C.2000 COX NEWS SERVICE
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Internet is quickly becoming a gun-owner's
dream market. Hundreds of sites offer everything from custom
holsters to Colt revolvers _ many at discount prices.
</P>
<P>
   No driving to a store. No trade show fee. Unbelievable
selection.
</P>
<P>
   While gun collectors and dealers hail this new branch of
E-commerce, it's making gun control groups increasingly nervous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, the Internet is becoming a virtual gun show,'' said
Kristen Rand, director of federal policy for the Violence Policy
Center, a group that supports gun control.
</P>
<P>
   Rand said the Web is creating a national market that facilitates
interstate gun sales. This defies ``the bedrock of gun regulation
in America'' which is to keep sales within each state in an effort
to control distribution and access, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, gun control advocates say regulations on Internet
sales are not carefully monitored and that many sites, which merely
hook up buyers and sellers, have no obligation to abide by the
rules that regulate gun dealers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone can set up an Internet site that sells guns,'' Rand
said. ``They can sell a million guns over a site and the owner of
the site would be under no duty to get a federal firearms
license.''
</P>
<P>
   Some big online auction houses, including eBay, have decided to
refuse gun trade, but there are still an estimated 80 auction sites
devoted to firearms and about 4,000 sites that have gun sales.
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenon has added another dimension to what are called
``secondary markets'' for guns, which previously included gun shows
and private sales, often through classified ads. These secondary
markets _ which account for an estimated 40 percent of sales _ have
long been the target of gun control proponents.
</P>
<P>
   But comparing online sales to gun shows and private sales isn't
fair, says Dale Blankenship, who owns and operates dalesguns.com _
an Internet site that he started about two years ago, to supplement
his home-based business in Powhatan, Va.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand how they come up with that,'' he said. ``I
think Internet is the safest.''
</P>
<P>
   Blankenship, who has worked in gun repair and sales for 17
years, said that the problem at gun shows has to do with unlicensed
dealers. On the Internet, regulations call for any firearm
transaction to take place through a dealer with a federal license,
which requires a background check.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people get real confused... they think I can just
sell to anybody,'' he said. ``I can't deliver (a firearm) to
anybody except another dealer.''
</P>
<P>
   If a private individual wants to buy a gun on the Internet, they
must do it through a dealer, who charges the buyer a small fee.
Sellers require the buyer to send a photocopy of the federal
license bearing a fresh signature.
</P>
<P>
   But sellers are not required to call the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms to verify that a name or address on a license
is valid, although the regulation says dealers may investigate
further if they wish.
</P>
<P>
   Gun control proponents say these regulations are loosely
enforced and easy to circumvent.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, two high school students in Montclaire, N.J.,
figured it out.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the 17-year-olds passed themselves off as dealers,
after persuading a Florida gun dealer to give them his license
number on an online chat room.
</P>
<P>
   They used the number to forge a license and used it to purchase
at least four handguns through an Atlanta, Ga.-based site,
GunBroker.com. Federal licenses are about the size of a car title
and don't carry a photograph.
</P>
<P>
   Blankenship said he didn't know if he could spot a fake license
but added, ``I think I would be able to tell. I hope I would.''
</P>
<P>
   Gun control advocates say another flaw in the Internet gun trade
is that the dealer can't see the customer face to face.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a customer comes in person, a dealer might be able to
look at someone and ask: Does this person look underage? Does this
person look like he is clearly intoxicated or mentally deranged?
Over the Internet, you can't tell. You can't see at all,'' said
David Bernstein, spokesperson for Handgun Control, Inc., a
Washington-based lobby group.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Blankenship said that when someone walks into his
business to buy a gun, he can't deny them a sale because of their
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I legally can't say: 'Hey you don't look right,''' he said,
adding that he won't sell anyone a gun until they pass a background
check required by law.
</P>
<P>
   The growing trend of Internet gun sales has caught the attention
of state and federal law enforcement agencies. The push for
regulations will likely increase as more buyers turn to the Web.
Some sites are already making millions in sales. The Atlanta-based
GunBroker.com is projecting $12 million in sales by the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the booming E-commerce, the ATF is considering
starting a unit to investigate firearms and explosives sales on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In Illinois, Attorney General Jim Ryan has launched a new
initiative to target illegal gun sales online and at gun shows.
House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., is backing a request from
Ryan for an $ 850,000 federal grant to create a special unit to
investigate and prosecute such cases.
</P>
<P>
   In the U.S. Senate, an amendment that would have prohibited
unlicensed dealers from selling guns over the Internet was defeated
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., who introduced the measure, said
he is revising pending gun control legislation to require online
verification of licensees. But such a provision has little hope of
passage this year as several gun control measures have been stuck
in Congress for months.
</P>
<P>
   Rand said that delays in further regulation of Internet gun
sales could have tragic results.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a matter of time before something truly horrible
happens where someone got their weaponry over the Internet...It's
entirely predictable.''

   WILMINGTON, Del. _ Though the leaderboard would indicate
otherwise, the clock was not rolled back at the McDonald's LPGA
Championship. Instead, a veteran's favorite recipe _ tough
conditions and major championship nerves _ was rolled forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``When 1 under is on the board, or 2 under is on the board, it
just seems easier to look at,'' said Jane Geddes, who aced the
par-3 17th, shot 5-under-par 66, and assumed a one-shot lead after
the first round in this major championship at DuPont Country Club.
``You feel you can rise to the occasion.''

years, the 40-year-old Geddes is familiar with the names behind
her.
</P>
<P>
   Like 49-year-old Pat Bradley, the pride of Westford, Mass., and
Betsy King, 44, who shot 68 to share second place with Tracy Hanson
and Gloria Park.
</P>
<P>
   Or 43-year-old Patty Sheehan, locked in a four-member group at
69.
</P>
<P>
   Or Jan Stephenson, 48, whose round of 70 put her even with
Annika Sorenstam, Laura Davies, and seven others.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was 43-year-old Beth Daniel in a 20-player logjam at
72 that featured Karrie Webb. Even the legendary JoAnne Carner,
still in love with golf at age 61, shot 73.
</P>
<P>
   Geddes, Bradley, King, Sheehan, Stephenson, Daniel, Carner.
Combined they have won 20 major championships, but in this yearlong
celebration of the LPGA Tour's 50th anniversary, the group
represents yesterday's glory (only King has posted a win in the
last three years) more than tomorrow's greatness. But that isn't to
say they can't enjoy today.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of my best rounds in a long while, which is why I'm
so excited,'' said Bradley, who took a glance at the leaderboard
before her afternoon tee time and saw what Geddes had _ decent
scores, but not deep red ones. ``Over the years, my success has
been in tournaments like the majors (she's won six), where it's not
a putting contest, where players are 8 or 9 under after the first
round. When I saw that it was hovering around 1 or 2 or 3 under, I
said, `This is exactly what I need.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, like Geddes, is not filled with false hopes. She will
be the American Solheim Cup captain in October, so she's on Tour
this season as much to keep an eye on her potential team members as
to put up great scores. But don't think that a little pride isn't
burning inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get frustrated at myself because one minute I can play a
hole brilliantly, then the next minute make just a really stupid
mental mistake,'' said Bradley, who made very few miscues over a
DuPont CC course that played soft thanks to a torrential downpour
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The rain, said Bradley, was a blessing because the course had
played fast and hard during practice rounds and balls were
constantly rolling through pinched fairways and into thick rough.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nice, because people could be aggressive,'' said
Bradley, who went out on the back side and posted birdie-birdie,
then got to 3 under with a birdie at the 17th. A birdie at the
par-3 third got her to 4 under, but Bradley gave that stroke back
on the next hole before coming in with five straight pars and a
wide smile.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley hasn't tasted major victory since 1986 and Geddes has to
go back to 1987 for the second of her two major conquests, in this
event though not at this venue. Back then, said Geddes, ``I took it
for granted. I thought I was going to do it forever.''
</P>
<P>
   But forever ended in the late '80s for Geddes, who won five
times in 1987 then not again for four years. She has not won since
1994 and her blossoming Internet company has fueled thoughts of
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been putting a lot of pressure on myself, but I came here
with the goal in mind to have fun and enjoy this week,'' she said.
``It's a major, on a golf course I like, and whatever happens,
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   After a bogey on her fourth hole, the 13th, Geddes pouted and
was reminded of her pre-tournament philosophy by her caddie. It
must have worked because she went birdie-par-birdie-ace to get to 3
under.
</P>
<P>
   Shades of 1986 when she won the US Open? In a way, yes, because
``I like when pars are good scores. I generally play well when
courses are tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so tough that she couldn't finish with a 20-foot birdie putt
at the eighth hole (her 17th), then close with a sand wedge to 6
feet at the par-5 ninth that set up her fifth birdie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a ball today,'' said Geddes, whose best finish in 12
starts this year is a tie for 17th. ``It's been a long time since
I've had fun on the golf course.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of her colleagues, those blasts from the past, were saying
the same thing.

COMPETITION SHOULDN'T STRIKE FEAR IN HEARTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ They are relatives, baseball cousins who share a
similar view of history. They both watch their teams play in
ancient ballparks; both can interview parents, and in some cases
grandparents, who have never witnessed a World Series title; and if
you look into their eyes, you can sense that there is October
sadness tattooed on their souls.
</P>
<P>
   That's where the comparisons end between fans of the Red Sox and
Cubs. They are cousins, not siblings. No one in North America can
panic like a Sox fan. Rod Beck has pitched for both teams and has
noticed the major differences. In Chicago, he was a 9-to-5er
playing before afternoon crowds where fans ``enjoy the game, but
are very laid-back. If you actually win, it's considered a bonus.''
In Boston, the reliever has seen how winning is demanded, so much
so that there is audience uneasiness about a team in first place.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox defeated the Yankees Thursday night at Fenway Park,
4-2. Before the win, which resulted in a split of the four-game
series, the Sox were 11-18 in their previous 29 games. Because of
that Tigeresque streak (the pathetic baseball team, not the
precocious golfer), mournful wails can be heard throughout New
England. The chorus varies slightly: Get another starter. Get
another bat. Get Sammy. Get Juan. Get Moises. Get Bagwell.
</P>
<P>
   Get a grip.
</P>
<P>
   When the Sox go into their front yard and look at the homes of
their American League neighbors, they return to their living rooms
mumbling to themselves, ``You expect us to be worried about that?
Please.''
</P>
<P>
   They're right. It's one thing to have weaknesses, which the Sox
have. It's quite another to face someone who can exploit your
weaknesses and bring you to your knees. There is no such team in
the AL. But it's hard to think about that when it seems that your
team is flammable, one strong wind away from being singed for the
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the team struggles, the fans' minds go back to history,''
Red Sox coach Tommy Harper said. He laughed and added, ``History
belongs to fans; games belong to the players. You know, I know
there are some fans who say, `Well, they win every time I go to the
game.' Or, `They win when I wear my green hat.' '' Harper pointed
to Nomar Garciaparra's locker and said, ``I think we win when he
wears a certain hat.''
</P>
<P>
   The hat Garciaparra wore Thursday was the hat he's been wearing
all season. It's a hitting hat. His average is now a
you've-got-to-be-making-this-up .396. Yankees manager Joe Torre
said pitching to the shortstop is like playing chess _ short of
relying on computerized chessmaster Deep Blue, there aren't a lot
of answers for Garciaparra, who is Bobby Fischer with a bat.
</P>
<P>
   Those who are skeptical of the Sox should go house hunting in
the AL neighborhood. Below are the seven-best dream homes in the
league:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO (46-26)
</P>
<P>
   Record vs. Sox: 1-2
</P>
<P>
   Conversation piece: Their best pitcher is a man named James
Baldwin, whose namesake was the most provocative American essayist
of the 20th century. The pitcher doesn't dazzle like the writer,
but he has the second-best ERA (3.56 to Pedro Martinez's 1.18) in
the AL. He also has 10 wins.
</P>
<P>
   Change-the-subject material: While Chicago has received
excellent pitching so far (second to the Red Sox), their top three
starters after Baldwin are Cal Eldred, Jim Parque, and Mike
Sirotka.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   OAKLAND (42-29)
</P>
<P>
   Record vs. Sox: 2-2
</P>
<P>
   Conversation piece: Their top three starters _ Kevin Appier, Gil
Heredia, and Tim Hudson _ have a combined won/lost record of 24-9.
One of Hudson's losses was an aberrational 14-2 bombing against the
Red Sox April 15. So in the last two months, he has only one loss.
Opponents hit only .222 against him.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Change-the-subject material: At times, it seems as if Rob Deer
is their patron saint. They have struck out a staggering 529 times
this season, tops in the league.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE (40-30)
</P>
<P>
   Record vs. Sox: 2-1
</P>
<P>
   Conversation piece: This is the Mariners' first full season in
their new home. They reinvented themselves when they moved. They
and the Red Sox have given up the fewest home runs in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Conversation piece II: Edgar Martinez. He could play until he's
50 and still hit .325.
</P>
<P>
   Change-the-subject material: Top three starters are soft-servers
Aaron Sele, Jamie Moyer, and John Halama.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (37-32)
</P>
<P>
   Record vs. Sox: 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   Conversation piece: When healthy, they have an awesome
Rotisserie lineup that includes Roberto Alomar, Manny Ramirez, and
Jim Thome.
</P>
<P>
   Change-the-subject material: The Indians have seven pitchers on
the disabled list. They also strike out nearly as much as the A's.
They also have an incurable Pedro Complex. In the mind of every
Indian there is an image of Martinez as king. He simply has the
team and the city spooked.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (36-31)
</P>
<P>
   Record vs. Sox: 4-5
</P>
<P>
   Conversation piece: The buzz is that Juan Gonzalez will be
joining Bernie Williams and Derek Jeter in New York. If Gonzalez
does land in New York, he will join a good team that has such a
sense of entitlement that it believes it is a great team.
</P>
<P>
   Change-the-subject material: Despite their $90 million-plus
payroll, the Yankees know they will go nowhere if they don't get
another pitcher. Orlando Hernandez has a sore elbow. Roger Clemens
is on the DL. David Cone has one win.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO (39-34)
</P>
<P>
   Record vs. Sox: 4-4
</P>
<P>
   Conversation piece: The Blue Jays have the highest fielding
percentage in the league. Carlos Delgado is the best home run
hitter in the league, and David Wells has 12 wins.
</P>
<P>
   Change-the-subject material: They are neighborhood outsiders.
While the other contending teams occupy the top seven ERA spots
(led by the Red Sox), the Jays are at 5.47, high above the league
average of 4.96. They won't be in the playoffs with pitching like
that.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ANAHEIM (36-35)
</P>
<P>
   Record vs. Sox: 2-1
</P>
<P>
   Conversation piece: Darin Erstad. Simple as that.
</P>
<P>
   Change-the-subject material: They have four starters on the
disabled list. Two of their best hitters (Mo Vaughn and Troy Glaus)
are among the league's top four strikeout victims.
</P>
<P>
   End of tour. It's enough to make you appreciate your own house
and its red, squatty ``B'' logo.

A TALE OF A RACY LIFE ORBITING THE STARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MCCABE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
ORIGINAL STORY BY 
A Memoir of Broadway and Hollywood 
By Arthur Laurents 
Knopf, 436 pp., illustrated, $30 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sex _ his preferences and others', and denials of same _ is a
leitmotif of Arthur Laurents's memoir, and it's understandable. Sex
and sexual politics permeate the show business milieu that he
inhabited for so long, as a director and a writer of plays and
movies. You live and breathe it, and big decisions are based on it
_ probably more than those who are not in the business realize.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as befits a successful dramatic writer, Laurents is too
good a storyteller to get sidetracked from his story line, the
``arc'' of which chronicles his odyssey from a boyhood in Flatbush
to coming of age in college and the Army to his varied experiences
writing for radio, theater, and the movies. His experiences brought
him into contact with an assortment of legends. He seems to have a
telling anecdote about everyone from Alfred Hitchcock and Katharine
Hepburn to David Lean and Barbra Streisand. A fair number of these
legends turn out to be wily, treacherous, insecure, disagreeable,
and _ worst of all _ less talented than legend has it.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Laurents also settles scores with what he calls
``unrepentant homophobes'' and anti-Semites. Gloria Jones, widow of
novelist James Jones, was one of the former, he says, who
congratulated him for his writing of women. (Laurents's reaction:
``Wasted point: It's men that homosexual men can have trouble
writing.'') An anti-Semite was a professor of playwriting at
Cornell who would start sentences with ``you Jews'' _ there were
two others besides Laurents in the class. The professor's first
instruction to the class was a ukase: Never begin a play with a
telephone ringing. Laurents immediately wrote a one-act play that
began with a telephone ringing.
</P>
<P>
   A particular object of Laurents's disaffection is choreographer
Jerome Robbins, a ``monster'' with whom he collaborated on the
musicals ``West Side Story'' and ``Gypsy.'' Another figure is movie
director Sidney Pollack, with whom Laurents worked as screenwriter
of the movie ``The Way We Were.'' Laurents writes that Pollack
sacrificed a good movie to keep Robert Redford happy.
</P>
<P>
   There are enough gibes and lines to keep the devotee of
behind-the-scenes stories interested. Producer Ray Stark ``worked
overtime at the job he wanted: casting young actresses.'' A rival
for Laurents's affections is described as an ``assisted blonde.''
On playwright William Inge: ``His work made him seem a very
sensitive man; which he was _ to himself. He didn't understand what
it was to be a friend.''
</P>
<P>
   There are three wonderfully bitchy descriptions on one page
alone. Stripper Gypsy Rose Lee ``hadn't a good body but she was
smart enough not to expose it.'' Robbins ``was the rock and the
hard place.'' An actress playing Gypsy ``looked virginal even
though she was going through the orchestra like a dose of salts.''
Fortunately, Laurents's best lines are usually dryer than that one.
Consider an observation that recurred in Sardi's restaurant
whenever Moss Hart, not known for his interest in marriage, would
appear with a woman: ``Ah, here comes Moss Hart with the future
Miss Edith Atwater.''
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of inside looks. One of Leonard Bernstein's
problems: he ``wasn't housebroken.'' Here's Gypsy's mother's
trenchant advice to her daughter who's facing her first audience of
men: ``Make 'em beg for more and then don't give it to them!'' The
difference between a superstar and a mere star: Superstars, like
Redford and Streisand, don't play their characters, they play
themselves playing their characters. A play's ``dialogue, like a
good wig, deceived too well. It made the play seem better than it
was.''
</P>
<P>
   Laurents is at his best when he lets his feelings show through
his caustic veneer. Arguably the most poignant scene in the book
has Laurents acting on an instinct he couldn't control. The feared
theater critic Walter Kerr and his wife, Jean, at the end of
Gypsy's striptease, which brings down the house, dash up the aisle
on their way out even though the show isn't over. Laurents is
livid. He blocks the couple at the head of the aisle. ``Go back to
your seats,'' he orders. ``It isn't over.'' Startled, they
dutifully turn around and return to their seats. Composer Jule
Styne is devastated, sure Laurents has blown the review then and
there. Later at Sardi's, Laurents is handed Kerr's review, an
unalloyed rave, especially for Laurents's book.
</P>
<P>
   And some of Laurents's gems sound like hard-earned wisdom.
``People, particularly writers, often hear what isn't said because
it's what they want to be said.'' ``She mistook his not being sure
what he wanted to be for not knowing who he was. I always knew what
I wanted to be; I had to discover who I was.''

   DRESSING-ROOMS (Undated) _ You are standing with your pants
around your ankles when a stranger pulls back a curtain and says,
``Peekaboo!'' You have been locked out in a public place wearing a
single black sock and a cocktail dress with a price tag hanging off
the side. You are standing in your underwear when the woman your ex
dumped you for strides imperiously into the room. Pop quiz: Are you
1) trapped in a Freudian nightmare, 2) a candidate for a case study
in ``The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders'' or
3) out shopping. The answer, obviously, is 3. And the source of

   HAMPTONS-WEEKEND (Undated) _ An island village. The end of last

mob encircles and entraps it until the police come. This is not an
episode of ``Survivor,'' the reality TV series which pits 16
castaways against one another as they vote each other off their

even jail. By Bob Morris.

   NATIELLO-FASHIONS (New York) _ Last week at Saks Fifth Avenue,
Craig Natiello, who designs for the Halston label, was showing his
fall collection to a circle of his faithful _ young society figures
including Tara Rockefeller and Somers White. He paused to note that
most truly chic women know how to dramatize their assets. Vamping

MILLER, FOUTS NEW FACES IN `MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL' BOOTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABC Sports ended its three-month search to rekindle the glory
days of ``Monday Night Football'' by hiring Dan Fouts and comedian
Dennis Miller and firing sideline reporter Lesley Visser, creating
a show that producer Don Ohlmeyer described as ``relevant,
accessible, and unpredictable.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall of Famer Eric Dickerson and ESPN's Melissa Stark will
replace Visser.
</P>
<P>
   Ohlmeyer and ABC Sports president Howard Katz explained that the
changes were necessary to stop the drop in ratings the last several
years and create not only a football telecast, but must-see
television.
</P>
<P>
   In the last three years, ABC fired Lynn Swann and Dan Dierdorf
in an attempt to right the ship _ all to no avail. Boomer Esiason
was fired after last season. ABC also fired its longtime director
(Craig Janoff) and producer (Ken Wolfe) to make way for a new
production team, assembled by Ohlmeyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't derive as much pleasure as I felt I should have,''
said Ohlmeyer, who produced ``Monday Night Football'' in the 1970s
during the heydays of Howard Cosell, Don Meredith, and Frank
Gifford.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation was rampant. Most of the usual suspects were either
working at another network or not interested. Former Miami Dolphins
coach Jimmy Johnson was too happy on his boat in Key West, Fla.
Mike Ditka took a job with a Chicago station. Bill Parcells said in
the Jets' front office. Dan Marino signed with HBO.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate slap came from Sterling Sharpe, who refused to
return telephone calls to ABC.
</P>
<P>
   The new team will need every bit of distinction it can muster.
Ratings last season dropped to to their lowest in the 30-year
history of the show. In 1970, the show earned a 18.5 rating. By
1977, the show had climbed to 21.5, and peaked in 1981 at 21.7.
It's been downhill since, bottoming out in '99 (13.8). That number
is still good for a Monday night program, but it can't compare with
the ``Monday Night Football'' of the glory years.
</P>
<P>
   Television has changed. More channels have meant more choices.
One of the great features of ``Monday Night Football'' were the
halftime highlights. These days, most fans have already seen more
and better highlights by the time Monday night rolls around.
Exclusivity is a mere memory.
</P>
<P>
   More troublesome to ABC Sports is ESPN. ESPN's Sunday night NFL
game is better produced, and while Michaels is still one of the
best play-by-play guys in the business, ESPN's Mike Patrick, Joe
Theismann, and Paul Maguire are no slouches. Throw in sideline
reporter Solomon Wilcots and ESPN's crew was arguably better than
ABC's.
</P>
<P>
   ABC auditioned about 20 people, including Rush Limbaugh.
Ohlmeyer said the conservative radio broadcaster was a very strong
candidiate, but was unable to convince ABC that he would he able to
juggle his radio job during the football season. Limbaugh might
still make a few special appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Both Ohlmeyer and Michaels said they were ``blown away'' by
Miller. During the workout session, Michaels said he was impressed
with Miller's general knowledge of the game, players, and team
histories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't look at Miller as comedian,'' Ohlmeyer said. ``His role
is to provide an interesting point of view about a sport that
people enjoy on television. Any other would be erroneous.''
</P>
<P>
   Ohlmeyer told reporters he had expected Miller to be
entertaining during the workout session in which he sat with
Michaels and called the Houston-Buffalo AFC Championship game.
``But I was knocked out by some of the observations he made that a
lot of professional anaylsts who looked at the same tape didn't
make,'' Ohlmeyer said. ``Miller brings a fresh way of looking at
things, which is the challenge of all broadcasters _ to observe the
obvious and present with a sense of discovery,'' Ohlmeyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Michaels said he is excited about his 16th year on the show and
is looking forward to working with Fouts, whom he described as a
great communicator, and Miller ``the ultimate wild card.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller, as irreverent as ever during a teleconference with
reporters, said he plans to stay in the background when it comes to
commentary on the heart and fortitude of players, but will be
free-wheeling when it comes to ``matters of the mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller conceded that he was a ``quirky hire'' and said that he
was ``reasonably stunned'' by the decision. ``I hope I can prove
them right.''
</P>
<P>
   Ohlmeyer said it's unclear how much time ABC will give the new
crew. ``Chemistry takes time, but we should be hitting our stride
by October,'' he said. ``It will be a work in progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Quite naturally, Ohlmeyer said he has assembled the best team
and praised both Dickerson and Stark as well. ``Each member of our
team has distinctive voices, distinctive personalities, and
distinctive points of view,'' Ohlmeyer said. &QL;

THE REALITY OF BEING AN OLDER MOTHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN VENNOCHI  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Massachusetts has become the first state where more babies are
born to women over the age of 30 than under it, according to
statistics just released by the state Department of Public Health.
For those of us who are finally ahead of a trend, rather than
behind one, this is a rare opportunity to deliver expert commentary
based entirely on personal experience.
</P>
<P>
   In a word: Ouch!
</P>
<P>
   That is the sound of my knees cracking as I rollerblade after my
almost 7-year-old daughter. It is also the sound of my ego bruising
when my 11-year-old son talks about the ``olden days'' _ as in the
'70s _ and begs me to stop playing vintage Carly Simon albums.
</P>
<P>
   The official Bay State phenomenon of older moms is explained by
the large number of educated women in the state and their tendency
to delay having children. Someday, I expect my daughter will be one
of those educated females. So, what would I tell her about the
pluses and minuses of putting off children for career or other
reasons?
</P>
<P>
   The first point is a cliche, but a necessary one for any parent
to convey: a child is a huge blessing and an equally huge
responsibility, no matter what the mother's age.
</P>
<P>
   There is no greater joy than the one that comes from a child's
sweet good night kiss. And there is no greater irritation than what
springs from a child's refusal to go to sleep when you have company
or simply no desire to lie down next to her in a bunk bed.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, the older you are, the harder it is to climb down
from the bunk bed. But in other ways, being an older mother has its
pluses.
</P>
<P>
   When your children study local and American history, you can
help with first-hand recollections of key moments. For example, I
can relate what I was doing during the Blizzard of '78 and where I
was when President Kennedy was shot.
</P>
<P>
   Children absolutely keep you young. You may be old enough to
remember singing ``She wore an itsy-bitsy, teeny-weeny, yellow
polka-dot bikini'' in the back seat of the family Rambler. But you
can't be totally over the hill if you can also trill along to
Britney Spears (``Oops, I did it again'') while navigating the
family minivan.
</P>
<P>
   The childless are starting to gripe that working parents shirk
their duties so that they can get home for soccer games. But young
children keep older parents more productive at work, in my opinion.
Who wants to be downsized when college tuition looms as a reality
until 2014?
</P>
<P>
   As for minuses, they mostly relate to feeling and looker older
than you want to admit. Once on Newbury Street, a sadistic parking
lot attendant looked, first, at me, then at the child-safety seat
in my car, and asked the age of my grandchild.
</P>
<P>
   There are constant cultural tradeoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Every time you try to listen to news, classical music, or
oldies, your children will switch the car radio to KISS 108. That
requires you to field questions from fifth-grade boys about what
Christina Aguilera means when she sings: ``I'm a genie in a bottle
/ You gotta rub me the right way.'' Who can remember?
</P>
<P>
   You watch ``Hey, Arnold!'' and ``Rugrats'' instead of
``Washington Week in Review. '' You play Candy Land and Junior
Scrabble when you would like to read a good book. When everyone is
talking about the latest movie, all you can do is hum the theme
song to ``Beauty and the Beast.''
</P>
<P>
   Alas, the solitude you seek as you get older is also more
difficult to achieve. When you take a bubble bath, your daughter
jumps in with you and her Barbies. When you long to linger over the
Sunday Times, your son drags you out for a game of one-on-one hoop.
At the beach, your children beg you to go in the water, when it
would be oh, so nice to fall asleep on the warm, dry sand.
</P>
<P>
   And what about the underlying professional rationale for putting
off motherhood _ that it is better to advance at work when you are
young, take a motherhood break, and then catch up? From a career
perspective, there is really no good time to have children.
Whenever you give birth, parenthood alters your perspective and
changes your priorities forever.
</P>
<P>
   You know what? The best time to have children is when you really
want them _ and when you are prepared to love them more than anyone
or anything else in the world.
</P>
<P>
   That is a trend worth contemplating.

VINEGAR SHOULD LOOSEN PLASTIC 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, June   25, 2000)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Some clear plastic was left on an outside aluminum storm
door. I failed to remove it with a hair dryer. How can I remove it?
</P>
<P>
   MARY ELLEN NAJARIAN, Waltham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. The longer the plastic film is left on an aluminum door (or
acrylic or Plexiglas), the harder it is to remove. Heat should
help, but what often happens is that you pull off a bit of plastic
and it divides itself into a long narrow strip. Not much
accomplished. It is like pulling off that plastic wrapping tape
that makes a real ripping sound when you pull it. When it comes off
in long strips, making me have to start all over, I quit.
</P>
<P>
   But mayonnaise or vinegar should work. Use vinegar; the
mayonnaise is too icky.
</P>
<P>
   How to use the vinegar: Because the plastic is impervious to
liquids, you have to pull off a bit of the plastic film and work
the vinegar between film and door. Let the vinegar seep down, then
try pulling off a bit more plastic. It is tedious, but I know of no
other way. I am surprised the heat didn't work, but it might have
set the plastic even more.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My front yard slopes toward the driveway, and when the
driveway gets wet it is slippery and also ices over in winter. How
can I keep water off the driveway?
</P>
<P>
   GEORGE GATZIOGIANNIS, Hopkinton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. If you cannot regrade the yard to divert the water elsewhere,
you have to accommodate it. Try this: Dig a trench parallel to the
driveway, just a foot or two from the driveway itself. Make it 12
inches wide and 12 or more inches deep, and fill it with crushed
stone. Try to aim the trench to the street. Some towns do not allow
you do guide water to the street, but the water is better on the
street than on your driveway. You could put a steel grille over the
trench for good looks.
</P>
<P>
   If push comes to shove and the town objects, then ask the town
for a better idea. Unless the water table is very, very low, I do
not think turning that trench into a dry wall to allow the water to
drain downward will work.
</P>
<P>
   I do not think the town has storm sewers that you could hook
into on the street.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My new roof has moss on one of the slopes. I was advised to
install zinc strips. Will they work to keep away moss, algae, and
mold?
</P>
<P>
   J.J., Medfield, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. The zinc strips were developed, I believe, in the South,
where algae, moss, and mold are rampant. This phenomenon has become
common in the North, as well. The strips are placed under the
second-highest row of shingles near the ridge, with about two
inches of zinc exposed. Rain runs over the strips, bringing a bit
of zinc down the roof. It is toxic to moss, algae, and mold, and I
have not heard that the strips don't work. Remember, however, that
this technique will not necessarily kill the growths, but is a
deterrent, a preventative to keep the growths from recurring. So,
you have to scrape up the moss and treat the area with one part
bleach and three parts water. If the growths are green algae (no
depth) and black mold, they too have to be killed with the bleach
solution before the zinc strips can do their work. As ever, I have
to say, wear skin and eye protection when working with bleach.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. You wrote recently about a caller referring to white pine
shingles, and you asked, why not white cedar? My contractor says
you can't find white cedar shingles anymore. What can I do now?
</P>
<P>
   CONFUSED
</P>
<P>
   A. Huh? Wha? You can find another contractor, who will find
white cedar shingles at any lumber store. Even the handyman found
some last summer, and also noticed some at Home Depot the other
day. Your contractor just can't be bothered, so that is why I
suggest getting another.
</P>
<P>
   It's ironic. The white cedar referred to is probably another
species altogether, juniper, the tree that produces the little gray
berries. But it is called white cedar in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   If you opt for white cedar shingles, specify Extras. They are
the top quality, have no knots, and perform the best. Expose them 5
inches for best performance. They are green (full of water) when
sold, and will dry out after they are installed, turning a nice
silver color. But in drying out, they shrink.
</P>
<P>
   Now you can get kiln-dried white cedar shingles, excellent for
good service and weathering, but they cost $2 a square foot, twice
as much as green shingles.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My tiler said he would put thin plywood over old linoleum and
put ceramic tile on the plywood. Is that OK?
</P>
<P>
   SALLY BURKE, Duxbury, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Sure. It is one of several techniques, and done right, the
tile will last for generations. Just make sure the plywood is
secured properly by screwing it down, because if it fails under the
new tile, you will have a whole new floor to redo.
</P>

AS E-COMMERCE WARS RAGE, SEND.COM FOCUSES ON PROFIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Michael Lannon has run Send.com for three years now. But as
Lannon has come to realize, dot-com years are like dog years: An
awful lot happens in a short space of time.
</P>
<P>
   Over those three years, the Waltham, Mass. company _ best known
for its ads featuring ``The Giver'' _ has gone from a business that
sold wine over the phone, to one that sold wine over the Internet,
to one that sells wine, gifts, and gift services over the Internet.
Over those same three years, e-commerce firms have gone from
unknown to incredibly hot to incredibly cold.
</P>
<P>
   We sat down with Lannon recently to find out what the experience
has been like.
</P>
<P>
   Q. The change in the e-commerce world between last year and this
year is enormous, isn't it?
</P>
<P>
   A.Last year, it felt like we were always running down a ski
slope. You needed all your energy not to fall and hurt yourself.
This year, we are going slower, but things feel more comfortable
and under control.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What does that mean in terms of managing your company?
</P>
<P>
   A.Last year, the focus was strictly on growing the top line.
This year, the market is demanding that we focus on getting
profitable.
</P>
<P>
   Q. So how have you done that?
</P>
<P>
   A.I'll give you one example. We use photography on our Web site.
Last year, we hired professional photographers to do that. This
year, we bought $25,000 worth of photography equipment and took the
pictures ourselves. We will save $100,000 in fees in just this one
area, and there are dozens of other examples just like that. We are
running things like a business now.
</P>
<P>
   Q. And you will be profitable by?
</P>
<P>
   A.The fourth quarter of 2001 _ six quarters from now.
</P>
<P>
   Q. You are still a private company. Will you be able to raise
the money you need to get from here to there?
</P>
<P>
   A.We have some strong venture investors. We will be able to
raise money from those investors and maybe from some new ones, as
well. If the stock market changes and an IPO makes sense, we will
be in a position to do that. The market will determine that.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How come you didn't join the herd that went public last fall,
when dot-coms were still in favor?
</P>
<P>
   A.The truth is we weren't ready to go public. We had a choice.
We could either prepare for Christmas or go public. We couldn't do
both. It turned out to be a blessing in disguise. If you have a
public stock that is in the tank, you get punished for it. Like it
or not, the stock price is a scorecard. We don't have that
distraction. As a private company we get to build the future
without the glare of the public spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Even without a stock in the tank, you must have had some
nervous employees this spring when the Nasdaq crashed.
</P>
<P>
   A.Morale definitely dipped for a while. We had to hunker down
and weather the storm. In the absence of communication from the
company, all anyone heard or read was negative. I met with every
employee and told them what was going on. We did a lot of
hand-holding, and we were able to make our retention package more
attractive. Fortunately we've had very little attrition.
</P>
<P>
   Q. You guys spent money last year to get your name known by the
public. Your ads were great, but do you regret spending the money?
</P>
<P>
   A.Not at all. We made an investment that will pay off over a
period of years, not immediately. The ad campaign made sense for us
because we have a different kind of transaction from most
companies. You don't buy anything from me directly. (Send.com's
gifts and services are provided by other retailers.) We need you to
trust us and find us credible. We need to shake your hand through
our Web site and our advertising. That may sound like a
rationalization, but it isn't.
</P>
<P>
   Q. And business is still growing, even though you have cut back
on your advertising?
</P>
<P>
   A.Traffic is growing. February was bigger than December, May was
bigger than February, and June will be bigger than May.
</P>
<P>
   Q. So reports of e-commerce's death have been exaggerated?
</P>
<P>
   A.I don't think anyone doubts that Internet commerce will
continue to grow. This current ugly environment will sort out the
good companies from the bad ones. It is going to force companies to
run smarter and reward those that do. I am extraordinarily
optimistic abut my industry. I am pessimistic about a lot of the
companies.

CHAOS IS PART OF THE DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Four to three is a rare score line in major soccer tournaments,
and when it occurs, the match has a good chance of being considered
a classic.
</P>
<P>
   Spain edged Yugoslavia, 4-3, with two injury-time goals in the
European Championships Wednesday in a game of high drama. But the
game in Brugge, Belgium, will not likely have the lasting effect of
the Italy-Germany World Cup semifinal that finished with the same
score after overtime in Estadio Azteca in Mexico City. There was so
much drama and unpredictability in the final stages of that match,
which took place 30 years ago, the score itself became the title of
a play and movie with a nostalgic '60s theme, the Italian version
of ``The Big Chill.''
</P>
<P>
   But such games symbolize the dynamic, and often chaotic, nature
of soccer. Yugoslavia appeared to have the match clinched with a
3-2 lead in the 49th minute. The Yugoslavs likely suffered a
letdown, since they had been assured of advancing to the
quarterfinals because Norway and Slovenia had tied, 0-0.
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish, though, needed to win to qualify because they had
lost to Norway, and the first tiebreaker is head-to-head
competition. So, Gaizca Mendietta's tying penalty kick signified
little. But French referee Gilles Veissiere allowed another minute
of injury time, increasing the total time played to 99 minutes, and
Alfonso Perez hit the winning goal in the final seconds. That
vaulted Spain to first place and set up a date with France Sunday.
And it knocked Norway out of the competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game shows the line which separates success from failure
that can be overcome in a minute,'' Spain's Josep Guardiola said.
``In one minute we reversed the situation, but if the referee would
not have whistled the penalty or if he had conceded less injury
time we would already be on the way home. But this is football.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never said we should be among the favorites. Others said
it, but not us. With this victory we have accomplished something,
but in reality we are where Spain always has been. The true measure
of quality is what we will do now. And we will be able to do it
only if we show we have the talent, the willingness to sacrifice,
and the right refereeing.''
</P>
<P>
   Euro 2000 has already produced some highlight comebacks.
Portugal rallied from a two-goal deficit to defeat England, 3-2.
Yugoslavia battled from a three-goal deficit to tie Slovenia, 3-3.
And Romania eliminated England after trailing, 2-1, with an
89th-minute goal.
</P>
<P>
   Euro 2000 has almost become a Club Med outing. Only the
Netherlands remains of the Northern European nations. Saturday's
quarterfinals include Portugal-Turkey in Amsterdam and
Italy-Romania in Brussels. Sunday's games are
Netherlands-Yugoslavia in Rotterdam and Spain-France in Brugge.
</P>
<P>
   The event is also a showcase for talent. Alfonso, who converted
the deciding goal for Spain, will likely attempt to leave Real
Betis, which has been relegated to the Second Division. But the
Seville club said Alfonso has a $43.6 million buyout clause in his
contract.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the most in demand are Real Madrid's Raul, who has a
$165 million buyout clause, and Barcelona's Portuguese midfielder
Figo ($125 million). The buyout clauses likely could be challenged
in court, but the process would be too time-consuming to be
worthwhile for prospective purchasers.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Juniors achievement
</P>
<P>
   The Copa Libertadores final in Sao Paulo also produced an
exciting conclusion, as Boca Juniors won the title for the third
time and the first time since 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiras was heavily favored in the final after playing to a
2-2 tie in Buenos Aires. Estadio Morumbi was filled with 75,000
fans _ 3,000 from Boca Juniors _ but the match finished, 0-0. And
Boca Juniors won, 4-2, on penalty kicks, thanks to the goalkeeping
of Colombian Oscar Cordoba.
</P>
<P>
   Cordoba stopped Faustino Asprilla and Roque Junior, silencing
the crowd, except for the Argentine minority, which included Diego
Armando Maradona in the broadcast booth. It was a particularly
bittersweet night for Roque Junior, the huge central defender who
keyed coach Luis Felipe Scolari's defense, since his next game will
be for AC Milan, which purchased him for $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Still on top
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution also completed an improbable comeback Wednesday
night, leaving them with a 4-point lead in the Eastern Division
going into Saturday's visit to Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   Leonel Alvarez and Ivan McKinley will reinforce the Revolution,
which rallied for a 2-2 tie at San Jose.

   BOSTON _ Six years after Hans Nilsson set out to develop a
research and development center in Greater Boston for Astra AB, the
Swedish pharmaceutical company is now aiming to become a major
player in drug discovery.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Astra will open a 170,000-square-foot campus on a
64-acre site near the Cambridge Reservoir. Inside a trio of
barn-shaped limestone and glass buildings, Astra's scientists will
try to find new drugs to treat cancer and infectious diseases.
</P>
<P>
   In planting roots here, Astra joins a growing list of major US
and European pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms expanding in
the Boston-to-Worcester corridor to take advantage of the area's
strength in genomics _ the mapping of the human genetic code. As
that process nears an important milestone, the race is already on
to create and market the next generation of medical therapies
expected to arise from the charting of human genes.
</P>
<P>
   The companies are all seeking to tap into the deep talent pool
at the area's universities, hospitals and high-tech companies,
which can help them further their research.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw from the start the superb science in the Boston area
and, after a quick look at Seattle, concluded we had to be here,''
Nilsson said.
</P>
<P>
   His company, now called AstraZeneca PLC, is only the latest
arrival. The region is home to pioneering genomic firms such as
Millennium Pharmaceuticals Inc. and top biotechnology firms such as
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer Inc. has a research presence in Cambridge, and Amgen
Inc., the nation's largest biotechnology company, is building a
research site there. Merck &AMP; Co. is developing a research tower in
Boston, while American Home Products is building a research site in
Cambridge and a manufacturing plant in Andover.
</P>
<P>
   (The world's single largest pharmaceutical research center is in
Groton, Conn., where Pfizer on Monday will formally open a
585,000-square-foot center with 120 laboratories and 800
researchers.)
</P>
<P>
   For AstraZeneca, a leader in gastrointestinal prescription drugs
to treat ulcers, the new research and development site here will
use the continuing stream of genomic information to create drugs
that can battle bacteria and fungi and cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Nilsson said AstraZeneca, which last year derived about
two-thirds of $18.4 billion in revenues from gastrointestinal and
cardiovascular drugs, is seeking to develop 15 drugs by 2003 for
regulatory approval. He said the company's goal is to reduce the
time to develop and bring new drugs to market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're taking data from the Human Genome Project off the
Internet every night and looking to where it can fit with our work
in infectious diseases,'' said Kenneth Fasman, vice president and
gloal head of informatics for AstraZeneca's Enabling Science and
Technology center.
</P>
<P>
   AstraZeneca's research center here is aimed at drug discovery.
It plans to hand off other functions, such as animal and human
testing, development and manufacturing, to other parts of the
global company. Its strategy is similar to Pfizer, which uses its
Cambridge site to evaluate emerging technologies, particularly in
genomics, that are then used at company drug research and
development centers in Groton.
</P>
<P>
   The reserach center here was designed before the completion of
the Astra and Zeneca merger in April 1999. Since, the company has
eliminated 1,000 research jobs worldwide, including 100 in
Worcester. Some of those laid off were offered positions in
Waltham.
</P>
<P>
   Nilsson, touring the Swedish-designed facility here, said it was
designed so that the chemistry and biology laboratories could be
quickly altered to accommodate corporate needs. To encourage
researchers from different parts of the company to meet and talk,
there are free coffee stations along with chairs and tables in a
center atrium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too often research buildings have bright atriums in the center
with dark areas for the scientists _ something we did not want to
do,'' he said, pointing to the windowed office cubiles and
brightly-lit laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen whether AstraZeneca's work environment
here will help attract scientists and computer engineers more
familiar with Cambridge's cluster of young companies.

ARNOLD TO FIRE UP NEXT PHASE OF TEEN ANTISMOKING ADS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With a teen rally set for Seattle this weekend and ads that urge
young people to rip tobacco ads out of the magazines they buy,
Boston ad agency Arnold Communications is kicking off the next
phase of a $185 million marketing campaign that seeks to discourage
teenagers from smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Released earlier this year, the first ads in this campaign were
edgy and controversial. In one TV spot that made some networks
nervous, teens piled body bags outside a tobacco company building
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   New ads seem to retain that same in-your-face tone; they
continue to portray the tobacco industry as a seemingly greedy and
manipulative Mephistopheles out to take control of teenagers' lives
by addicting them to a product that kills one-third of its users.
</P>
<P>
   A new magazine ad shows an image of a hand with bandaged
fingers. The text urges the magazine's readers to ``Rip out the
next cigarette ad you see because tobacco killed about 430,000
people last year and paper cuts didn't kill anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The client for the campaign is the American Legacy Foundation, a
group established by the 1998 master settlement agreement between
the tobacco industry and 46 states.
</P>
<P>
   Under the settlement, the tobacco companies agreed to pay out
over time more than $200 billion. Part of the Legacy Foundation's
job is to use some of that money to finance an ad campaign that has
the goal of reducing smoking among teens.
</P>
<P>
   Many ad agencies vied for that lucrative assignment.
</P>
<P>
   In September, the foundation announced a winner _ an alliance of
ad agencies and public relations firms led by Arnold, New England's
largest ad agency.
</P>
<P>
   After extensive research with teens, the alliance earlier this
year unveiled a campaign it called ``truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Using ads and a Web site at www.thetruth.com, the campaign urges
teens to take control of their lives by rejecting the influence of
tobacco marketing, said Lisa Unsworth, an Arnold executive vice
president. Truth provides facts about tobacco and the tobacco
industry and enables teens to make informed decisions about
smoking, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Looking to achieve this goal, one recent TV ad for black teens
says, ``Every year menthol cigarettes leave more than 33,000 minty
fresh African-American corpses.''
</P>
<P>
   In the latest phase of the campaign, plans call for about a
thousand handpicked teens to gather this weekend in Seattle for a
crash course in grass-roots, antitobacco advocacy.
</P>
<P>
   After the summit, plans call for ``truth'' buses to tour major
cities. At each stop, some summit-trained teens will preach the
truth gospel. One scheduled stop is outside Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   What has made the truth campaign potentially controversial is a
provision in the master settlement.
</P>
<P>
   In return for agreeing to pay out billions of dollars and to
scale back their own advertising, the tobacco companies insisted on
language in the settlement that asks the foundation to refrain from
running ads that ``vilify'' tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   When the initial truth ads aired, there was a debate over the
meaning of ``vilify.'' Some observers might assert that ads hinting
that tobacco executives are liars who traffic in a killer drug
might qualify as vilification.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold's Unsworth argues otherwise. Ads have been thoroughly
lawyered to avoid violating the ``vilify'' provision, she said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the tobacco industry has declined to publicly weigh in
with its own definition of vilify.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no problem with much of what the foundation is
doing,'' said Philip Morris USA media relations manager Brendan
McCormick. ``But we're disappointed with some of the ads and the
tone of the Web site. We don't think they're an accurate depiction
of our company, our employees, and the way we do business.''
</P>
<P>
   Some might argue ads that focus on the consequences of smoking
might be as effective as ads that seemingly target tobacco
companies.
</P>
<P>
   That may be the case for ads aimed at adults, Unsworth said, but
research shows that teens are most likely to respond to antismoking
ads that highlight the manipulative marketing strategies of tobacco
companies.

IMMIGRANTS

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Last Sunday night, British customs officers at the port
city of Dover became suspicious about a produce truck that had just
arrived by ferry from Holland.
</P>
<P>
   They opened the back of the truck to find crates of tomatoes.
Still suspicious, the officers used a forklift to unload a few
crates to see what lay behind.
</P>
<P>
   One officer shimmied over the remaining stacks of tomatoes. To
his horror, the hot, darkened compartment contained the bodies of
58 Chinese immigrants. Two others were still alive.
</P>
<P>
   The 56 men and four women had paid up to US$30,000 each to be
smuggled into Britain, probably in search of jobs where they could
make more in a month than they could in a year in China.
</P>
<P>
   However, the truck's ventilation system had been was switched
off Sunday afternoon, a rare day when temperatures soared above 90
degrees. The air-tight produce compartment became a hot, airless
death chamber.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the truck's Dutch driver was charged with 58 counts
of manslaughter, and police were questioning other suspects in what
authorities believe is one of many well-organized cells of refugee
smugglers known as ``snakeheads.''
</P>
<P>
   The deaths come at a time when Europeans are struggling to come
to grips with the growing influx of immigrants from Asia and
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The Geneva-based International Organization for Migration
estimates that as many as 400,000 illegal immigrants enter Europe
each year _ about 100,000 more than the United States.
</P>
<P>
   From Africa they come across the broad expanse of southern
Spain, which is known as the ``southern gate,'' Europe's version of
the Rio Grande.
</P>
<P>
   From Asia, they travel the arduous route through Russia and
eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Once in the European Union, they can move between countries
without documents as most border passport stops have been removed.
Britain is one of the few EU members that still checks passports at
the border, forcing immigrants without documents to find other
means of entry.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the United States, which was built by immigrants seeking
opportunity, European countries are still struggling with the
demands of becoming multicultural.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, public opinion in Europe has shifted against
immigrants, who are regarded by many as poor foreigners trying to
sponge off richer countries.
</P>
<P>
   Europe, again, unlike America, has little infrastructure for
assimilating people with different languages and religions. Polls
show many Europeans are convinced that illegal immigration is out
of control, and is likely to become worse.
</P>
<P>
   Voters respond favorably these days to the inflammatory
anti-immigration rhetoric of Austria's Jorge Haider, Denmark's Pia
Kjaersgaard and France's Jean Marie Le Pen.
</P>
<P>
   Even moderate politicians have responded to the concerns and
have pushed for tougher immigration rules and enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   However, advocates for refugees believe these new restrictions
only make it more likely that immigrants will go underground.
Consequently, they say that blame for the dreadful episode in Dover
must be shared not only by the gangs that traffic in human cargo
but also by European politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Khalid Koser of London University's Migration Research Center
believes the trend of anti-immigration policies have boosted a
market for refugee smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main reason illegal immigration appears to be growing is
that restrictive immigration policies have increased, making it
difficult for people to arrive in Europe legally,'' Koser said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt that these criminal gangs are now going out
and marketing themselves, telling people they will be able to get
them into Europe,'' Koser said, ``and because it is more difficult
to get visas they are able to charge higher fees.''
</P>
<P>
   The push to stem the flow of immigrants has curtailed one
traditional avenue, claiming political asylum. Across Europe, about
350,000 people applied for asylum in 1999 _ a 20 percent jump over
1998. But fewer requests are being approved, and governments are
trying to end the practice of using applications to enter a country
legally and never leaving.
</P>
<P>
   Britain denied most of the 75,000 applications it received last
year, but two-thirds of the applicants had in the meantime
disappeared into their ethnic communities.
</P>
<P>
   After being criticized by Conservative Party opponents, British
Prime Minister Tony Blair's government recently vowed to deport
many asylum seekers and jail others while their requests are
processed.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative leaders believe their attack on asylum applicants
has found a receptive audience among voters in Britain worried
about what party leader William Hague described as a ``flood of
bogus asylum seekers.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the political climate, European governments are more
interested in stopping new migrants than catching the masterminds
behind the illegal trade, Koser said.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, ``the big danger if they crack down on illegal
immigrants is that they will also close down the routes used by
genuine refugees to flee from persecution.''
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, almost all unskilled people now are excluded from
entry to the United Kingdom, despite the country's deeply valued
position as a harbor for persecuted people, said Nick Hardwick of
Britain's Refugee Council. ``It is virtually impossible for people
fleeing persecution to enter Britain legally,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, they are forced to resort to desperate measures.
</P>
<P>
   The migrants found in Dover came from Fujian province, a
southern coastal province with a rich history of its people
migrating abroad. In some villages, 10 percent of the population
has left, according to the International Organization for
Migration.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 50 international crime groups are involved in
organized refugee trafficking, officials say. The term for them _
``snakeheads'' _ comes from a gang based in Fujian province.
</P>
<P>
   Migrant smuggling has become big business. ``The profit these
criminals can make by smuggling humans in, rather than drugs, is
now very, very substantial,'' Jack Straw, the British Home
Secretary, told Parliament last Monday.
</P>
<P>
   To repay smuggling fees of US$20,000 to US$60,000, many
immigrants work in the service and garment industries. They find
housing with established family members.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 800,000 ethnic Chinese live in Europe, with most
making their homes in Britain _ about 250,000 _ and France _ about
200,000.
</P>
<P>
   Although the United States has been the favored destination for
smuggled ethnic Chinese, there are indications that Europe is
becoming a more attractive destination, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, European officials are trying to slow immigration
at a time when the continent is in need of fresh blood.
</P>
<P>
   Because of a low birth rate, the European Union's population
growth is the lowest since World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, many European countries face the prospect of
developing a population imbalance with a surplus of older people
and a shortage of younger people do to the work.
</P>
<P>
   In 50 years Germany, which is becoming more and more dependent
on foreigners for its labor force, is expected to have more
retirees than workers.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations in late March estimated that Europe may need
as many as 150 million new immigrants by 2025 to maintain the
present levels of working and tax-paying communities.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Hall, the research director at the Centre for European
Reforms, believes that in time, the EU may need to attract
immigrants, setting annual quotas for newcomers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Europe's population is falling,'' Hall said. ``If you take
Italy as an example, the Italian population is estimated to fall by
28 percent by the middle of this century.''
</P>
<P>
   While many political leaders are trying to clamp down on
immigration, others warn about the long-term consequences.
</P>
<P>
   In a February speech, former Italian Minister Massimo D'Alema
urged his countrymen to end their fear of immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we close the door to immigration,'' D'Alema said, ``we
would make our country poorer.''

<P>
   As the New Economy creates unprecedented wealth, African
Americans are earning more than ever before. Now philanthropic
organizations serving the black community are lining up for a
portion of the profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time, (African Americans) are in the position to
pool their resources so as to bring about social change,'' said Ron
Ancrum, a senior consultant at Third Sector New England, a Boston
consultancy that serves nonprofits.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, African Americans have made the bulk of their
charitable donations through church organizations, giving $4.8
billion to churches last year, up from $4.3 billion in 1998. But
the big nonprofits serving black communities have been slow to
catch up to the new class of black professionals that has emerged
as a result of the longest economic expansion in US history.
</P>
<P>
   Now the push is on to tap that growing roster of African
Americans who have moved into the executive ranks. The reason: a
record increase in black buying power over the past decade. As a
result, nonprofits that serve poor black areas are looking more
closely at how to compete more effectively for the wallets of the
emerging class of black wealth.
</P>
<P>
   And that class continues to grow. College attendance rates among
African Americans hit a record 40 percent in 1997, up from 32
percent in 1991, according to a report released this year by the
American Council on Education in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Of the nation's 34.5 million African Americans, 5.6 percent now
earn $50,000 or more, according to the US Census Bureau. Among
workers in the top fifth income percentile, African Americans now
earn an average annual salary of $94,000, up more than 60 percent
over the last two decades. White Americans in the same income
bracket earn approximately $134,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a number of factors leading to increased interest in
black philanthropy,'' noted Emmett D. Carson, president and chief
executive of the Minneapolis Foundation. ``For mainstream white
institutions there is the promise of a new donor base. . .
</P>
<P>
   ``Secondly, there are now African Americans who recognize that
for 200 years most black giving was crisis driven,'' he added.
``Now, however, there is a critical mass of doctors, lawyers,
financial executives, people who understand that you can give
strategically, that you can figure out the most pressing problems
facing African Americans and give through structured endowments,
wills, or bequests.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, total earnings of US black households rose to $490
billion, up from $441 billion in 1998, according to market
researcher Target Market News of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, black household income rose 40.2 percent during the
1980s, the fastest of any urban black population in the country,
according to labor economist Barry Bluestone, author of ``The
Boston Renaissance: Race, Space, and Economic Change in an American
Metropolis.'' That income jump is reflected in the suburban
communities within Route 128, which saw a 63.5 percent rise in
their black populations between 1980 and 1990.
</P>
<P>
   When Target Market examined charitable giving, it found
donations to nonprofits, political organizations, and educational
groups dropped to $7.3 billion in 1999 from $8.4 billion in 1998,
based on US Department of Commerce surveys of 3,000 black
households. At the same time, contributions to black churches
increased by $500 million. An additional half-billion dollars went
to emergency giving to family or friends.
</P>
<P>
   But turning more black earners into sophisticated givers is an
educational process, said Ancrum of Third Sector New England. ``Our
next step in Boston will be to hold smaller seminars focused
specifically on wills, estate planning, and teaching people that in
addition to leaving a legacy for your children, you can leave
something behind to a cause you believe in.''
</P>
<P>
   Many in the philanthropy field are also recognizing that a new
group of donors has emerged. Younger, perhaps even savvier, they
are not interested in simply writing a check.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are people who want to see, and perhaps even influence,
how their money is being used,'' said Carson, who calls such donors
``strategic givers.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Winters certainly fits that profile. A senior manager at
Boston-based AEW Capital Management, with $10 billion in public and
private assets, Winters, 40, earns a top salary and lives in
Newton.
</P>
<P>
   Winters made an annual contribution of $5,000 to Dimock
Community Health Center, but he wasn't satisfied with simply
writing a check. So he joined the board. ``I joined because I
wanted to make a contribution that went beyond dollars,'' he said.
``I wanted to provide a certain perspective as well as expertise.''
</P>
<P>
   Michele Courton Brown, 38, of Boston, supports the private
school her children attend and gives to the United Negro College
Fund and Fisk University. She also served on a committee that
raised $4 million to restore part of the Museum of African American
History.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who serves on eight boards, says white organizations ask
her for higher donations than black groups. ``Majority
organizations will say, gee, can you make an investment of
$10,000,'' said Brown, president of FleetBoston Financial
Foundation. ``African American organizations, by contrast, seem to
be apologetic. They may ask for $1,000. So the expectations for
giving appear to be higher at white organizations than at
African-American organizations, which rely more on sweat equity
from board members than on big donations.''
</P>
<P>
   When Mary Frances Winters, president of the Winters Group Inc.,
a research consulting firm in Rochester, N.Y., interviewed
middle-class donors around the country for a 1999 report on black
philanthropy, she found they all consistently gave to their
churches. ``When I looked at other areas of giving,'' she said, ``I
found that they tended to give haphazardly and not in a planned
way. These were people who do not trust white institutions and
areless likely to invest their money or give to organizations
outside the church.''
</P>
<P>
   Winters also found that white universities are often more adept
at getting support from alumni than black ones, partly because they
have more resources. ``Vanderbilt University is the same size as
Howard University in terms of student body, but Vanderbilt had 40
development officers and Howard had five.''
</P>
<P>
   Carson says his alma maters are a perfect example. Princeton
University, from which he received a master's and doctorate, has
stayed connected to him, keeping current on his address changes and
diligently seeking contributions from his six-figure income.
Meanwhile, Morehouse College in Georgia, the historically black
college from which he received his bachelor's degree in 1981, has
been much less aggressive in tapping his support.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I moved to Washington, D.C., Princeton found me,'' Carson
told a group of black philanthropic professionals who met in Boston
a few weeks ago. ``I moved to Maryland and guess who sent a note
thanking me for a modest contribution? Princeton. When I moved to
Minneapolis, Princeton knew it. Somehow Princeton knows where I am
before I get there. Morehouse still thinks I live in Chicago.''
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Morehouse says it has stepped up efforts to reach
alumni and is now embarking on a major development campaign. But it
has some catching up to do.
</P>
<P>
   Spelman College in Georgia and Hampton University in Virginia,
both historically black colleges, have launched major campaigns
aimed at their graduates and others who might be willing to endow
scholarships or create academic chairs.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the push has paid off.
</P>
<P>
   In May, members of the class of 1990 donated $66,000 to Spelman,
whose endowment now stands at $216.7 million, up from just $156
million in 1997. Trisa Long Paschal of Spelman attributed a good
portion of that growth to wise stock market investments, but said
the school is also receiving more from alumni. Spelman has
completed a major campaign that raised $113 million and ``was the
first effort in which a historically black college had solicited
alumni for gifts of $10,000 or more.''
</P>
<P>
   Hampton, meanwhile, is in the midst of a $200 million campaign
to provide endowed technology scholarships and professorships that
so far has raised $160 million. ``In the past we did not have the
technology to keep in touch with'' the school's 20,000 alumni, said
Iris Wilson, an assistant business professor and associate director
of the Campaign for Hampton.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is that a lot of the historically black colleges do
not have the technical expertise to do that,'' she said. ``The Ivy
League colleges and the major white institutions know when someone
moves across the street.''

`GROOVE' LIVES UP TO ITS NAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
GROOVE 
Written and directed by: Greg Harrison 
Starring: Lola Glaudini, Hamish Linklater, Danny Kirkwood,
Mackenzie Firgens, Vince Riverside, Rachel True, Steve Van Wormer,
Nick Offerman, Elizabeth Sun, Angelo Spizziri, Jeff Witzke,
Dimitri, Ari Gold 
Running time: 83 minutes 
Rated: R (drug use, language and brief sexuality) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Groove,'' bless its little technopop heart, is the best movie
combining music and romance since ``High Fidelity.'' Greg
Harrison's loving and lovable celebration of San Francisco's
underground rave scene is never too dazed and confused to generate
a sweet communal vibe as it puts its own disarming spin on the
let's-party imperative. Its ravers juggle a search for love and a
need to appear cool, even when drugged, under the big glitter dome
that stands as a metaphor for the film itself. One of the feats it
pulls off is the fiction that raves are still underground
phenomena. These Bay Area ravesters know that you don't consult
newspapers or flyers on record store bulletin boards to find out
where the rave has floated to. You rely on word of mouth via phone,
pagers or the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the mystique is not knowing where any given weekend's
rave is. ``Groove'' gets off to a nice start by goofing on action
movies when a warehouse door rolls up to reveal the rave organizer
and true believer named Ernie (Steve Van Wormer) and his posse,
backlit in full Delta Force mode. Scarcely have they swung into
action, appropriating the place for one fugitive night, plugging
into the power line, than the kids start flocking to it, first
electronically, then by car, foot, and BART. The Bay Area Rapid
Transit system plays a supporting role in one of the year's
funniest vignettes, a blissed-out rave crew member riding the
subway deadpan with a huge mirrored glitter ball in his lap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Groove'' alternates in its pacing between convulsive lurches
and hazy floating episodes, mimicking the drugs, mostly Ecstasy,
that are a part of the festivities. The film gives equal time, or
nearly so, to Elizabeth Sun's disco goddess, Maggie, representing
the dancers, who are there for the music and the cool mode it
allows them to slip into, and those who are looking for something
more. Most prominent among the latter are Lola Glaudini's Leyla, a
jaded and slightly defensive veteran of Manhattan's disco wars, who
thinks she may have struck emotional paydirt with Hamish
Linklater's David, a bright nerd from East Lansing, Mich., laboring
to hide his shame over the fact that this is his first rave.
</P>
<P>
   If ``Groove'' falls back on teen movie formulas like the Night
of Fateful Encounters, it handles them lightly, smartly, and in
some cases even endearingly. It's hip enough to be unafraid of
feelings, but it's too hip to ever slobber, even when the
mood-altering evening throws a cloud over Dave's brother (Denny
Kirkwood) and his girlfriend (Mackenzie Firgens). DJ John Digweed
opens the door to a jumping soundtrack, and Harrison the writer has
given Harrison the director lots of wryly funny lines, spacy little
explosions of wit from the mouths of half a dozen characters. Yet
what makes ``Groove'' so likable is its basic sweetness and
brightness. It likes its characters. It gives raves the benefit of
any doubt by insisting that they foster a sense of community. It
even allows cops to seem cool. ``Groove'' is a stoner's holiday.

ANIMATED `CHICKEN RUN' IS SHEER POULTRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
CHICKEN RUN 
Directed by: Peter Lord, Nick Park 
Screenplay by: Karey Kirkpatrick 
With the voices of: Mel Gibson, Julia Sawakha, Miranda Richardson,
Jane Horrocks, Lynn Ferguson, Imelda Staunton, Benjamin Whitrow,
Tony Haygarth, Timothy Spall, Phil Daniels 
Running time: 82 minutes 
Rated: G 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The animation sweepstakes are ramping up, what with
``Dinosaur,'' ``Fantasia,'' and ``Titan A.E.'' Now room must be
made for ``Chicken Run.'' The question here is whether the Aardman
gang headed by Peter Lord and Nick Park could sustain the
claymation wave they launched with Wallace and Gromit and their
other shorts. The answer is yes. It's amazing how much life they
can breathe into a load of clay. ``Chicken Run'' is essentially a
savvy remake of a World War II prison camp escape drama, although,
strictly speaking, its English farm setting could more accurately
be described as an Auschwitz for chickens, complete with oven.
</P>
<P>
   The film opens on a starry sky beneath whose infinite vistas
sits an oppressively confining chicken farm, ringed with barbed
wire, sporting a sentry tower, and patrolled by vicious dogs. It's
bad enough that the chickens are butchered when they stop laying
eggs. It gets worse when the farmer and his witchy wife decide they
can make more money by installing a huge, clanking Rube Goldberg
gizmo that would allow them to feed chickens in one end and remove
packaged chicken pot pies at the other. As the virago voiced by
Miranda Richardson puts it, chickens in, pies out.
</P>
<P>
   Folded into the very basic gotta-be-free story line is more than
a bit of subtle humor needling such British folkways as the
tendency to carry on uncomplainingly. As one chicken says when
confronted with their fowl lives, ``It's a living.'' But that's not
good enough for the pluckiest of the lot, Ginger, voiced by Julia
Sawalha. She's determined to escape, and keeps breaking out, only
to be caught and tossed in the coal shed before being thrown back
behind the barbed wire with the rest of the chickens. Only her
egg-laying keeps the ax off her neck, a thing we realize at about
the same time we recognize the homage to ``The Great Escape'' when
we see Ginger killing time by bouncing a ball off the wall of her
sooty cell, a la Steve McQueen.
</P>
<P>
   Into the picture drops a cocky rooster named Rocky, a Yank who
doesn't disabuse them of their belief that he can fly, and can
teach the bottom-heavy hens how to fly, too, although he's a
refugee from his own brand of indentured servitude as a live circus
prop, shot from a cannon. Mel Gibson's voice supplies Rocky with
all the wiseguy lingo he needs until the jig is up and he has to
rebuild his credibility fast after an old RAF rooster named Fowler
(voice: David Whitrow) invokes the World War II Brit resentment
against pushy Yanks who were rather more forward with the local
women than the lads deemed sporting.
</P>
<P>
   The RAF rooster, the World War II elements, and the mood of
foreboding expressed in dark visuals mark ``Chicken Run'' as retro,
taking place, one would guess, in the '50s. Still, its pro-freedom
imperative keeps it from turning into a downer and its expressive
faces keep you watching. Before turning into a celebration of
traditional British pluck, borne on the flapping wings of a
ramshackle aircraft, it carries forward the hint of threatening
forces that so often imparts to the Aardman animations an extra
edge. In short, there's plenty to cluck about. The birds never make
it look easy, but ``Chicken Run'' is a case of up, up, and away.
There's nothing paltry about its poultry.

CARREY, FARRELLY MAKE A FARCE WITH A SPLIT PERSONALITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
ME, MYSELF &AMP; IRENE 
Directed by: Peter and Bobby Farrelly 
Screenplay by: Peter and Bobby Farrelly, Mike Cerrone 
Starring: Jim Carrey, Renee Zellweger, Robert Forster, Chris
Cooper, Richard Jenkins, Daniel Greene, Anthony Anderson, Mongo
Brownlee, Jerod Mixon, Mixchael Bowman, Traylor Howard, Tony Cox 
Running time: 116 minutes 
Rated: R (sexual content, crude humor, strong language and some
violence) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Me, Myself &AMP; Irene,'' the Farrelly brothers' new farce about a
Rhode Island state trooper with a split personality, will satisfy
Jim Carrey fans eager for a return to the contortionist slapstick
that made him a star. Still, not even Carrey's spectacular comic
elasticity can conceal the fact that the film is hit and miss. It
has a few laughs, but it also has a lot of dead air, and barely any
plot at all. In sporting terms, it's no home run. It's more like a
bloop double, with Carrey barely beating the throw to the bag.
Luckily, it also has something entirely unexpected going for it in
a big way.
</P>
<P>
   But first let's talk about Carrey. He plays a sweet doormat
named Charlie, who's so resolutely sunny, like Truman in ``The
Truman Show,'' that he doesn't realize he's suppressing a lot of
anger. It has to go somewhere, and it goes into an aggressive alter
ego, Hank. Charlie and Hank go everywhere together. When Charlie is
assigned to look after Renee Zellweger's cutie on the lam, and he
leaves his medication behind while fleeing some bad guys, the
comedy kicks into a higher gear.
</P>
<P>
   There's a certain satisfaction in watching bad Hank settle some
scores with locals who have been stepping all over Charlie,
including a bratty little girl and a lunk in a barber shop. You
wouldn't want to see anyone but Carrey jackknife his way through
this stuff. But it all seems a bit mechanical and even old this
time out, right down to the showdown in Providence's train station.
Carrey did this warring-self stuff more hilariously in ``Liar,
Liar.'' One problem is that while Hank walks the walk and talks
some foul-mouthed talk to Zellweger (who turns in a surprisingly
blah performance), he's never convincingly, ragingly wild.
</P>
<P>
   He's just Charlie in overdrive, delivering what by now has
become the obligatory crude humor of the Farrelly brothers. This
time the jokes involve a dildo and a chicken, among other things,
but even here, Carrey and the Farrellys largely seem to be going
through the motions. There's rudeness in their antics, but never
anything as liberatingly outrageous as in ``There's Something About
Mary.'' It's excess by the numbers, and a little of it goes a long
way in this script, which has been kicking around for a decade and
plays like it.
</P>
<P>
   People expect political incorrectness from the Farrellys, and
they dutifully try to provide it. Some have attacked the film for
making light of mental disabilities and confusing schizophrenia and
multiple personality disorder. But the same freedom of expression
that can make the film irritating also opens the door to an
exhilarating take on race. One of the plot elements involves
Charlie's newlywed wife running off with a diminutive black
chauffeur and subsequently giving birth to triplets. In the film,
Charlie is the one who raises them after she takes off.
</P>
<P>
   Played by Anthony Anderson, Mongo Brownlee, and Jerod Mixon, the
sons have grown into three enormous teens with genius IQs who talk
like street rappers but are sweet, loving, obedient, and even
protective of their father. They reassure Charlie as he hops on his
chopper that they'll do their homework and promise they'll have
``no bitches in the house after 11.'' In discussions of mature,
responsible filmmaking, the Farrelly brothers' names never come up.
But here they are, talking about race in America with more daring
and bite than any other movie has this season.
</P>
<P>
   What we've got here _ apart from funny, endearing characters
embodied by Anderson, Brownlee, and Mixon, who'll surely be
reunited in their own movie _ is trenchant, hilarious, almost
Swiftian commentary about white America's inability to see blacks
except as stereotypes. Although we're told the triplets' father is
a Mensa chapter chairman, we can only handle him if he's being
presented in the subservient role of a chauffeur. And we can only
accommodate the idea of young black geniuses in triplicate if
they're served up in boom-box mode.
</P>
<P>
   Who'd have thought it would be the Farrelly brothers who'd be
making such a frank statement about the limits of whites'
capacities to perceive blacks? And what does this say about
America's so-called race problem? Unexpectedly, Hollywood's
gross-out kings have served up a lukewarm comedy with a right-on
wakeup call about race. You may go into ``Me, Myself &AMP; Irene'' to
laugh at Carrey shuttling between Hank and Charlie. But you'll come
out loving the three endearing heavies I can't help thinking of as
the new Charlie's Angels.

A FEW DIM SPOTS DON'T DIMINISH `SUNSHINE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
SUNSHINE 
Directed by: Istvan Szabo 
Screenplay by: Szabo, Israel Horovitz 
Starring: Ralph Fiennes, Rosemary Harris, Rachel Weisz, Jennifer
Ehle, Deborah Kara Unger, Molly Parker, James Frain, David de
Keyser, John Neville, Miriam Margolyes, Rudiger Vogler, Mark
Strong, William Hurt 
Running time: 180 minutes 
Rated: R (strong sexuality, and for violence, language and nudity) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Few filmmakers have so consistently brought to historical
subjects the beauty and craftsmanship that Istvan Szabo has over a
long, distinguished career. ``Sunshine,'' his most ambitious film
yet, is a heartfelt and handsomely wrought three-hour saga of a
Hungarian Jewish family over three generations, covering more than
a century. It's neatly divided into three acts signified by three
ruling regimes _ monarchial, fascist, and communist _ all
multiplying the family's woes. Yet some of the tragedies endured by
the Sonnenschein family are brought on by the repeated desire of
its more conservative members to put an end to their outsider
status and become assimilated into the establishment.
</P>
<P>
   This is in large part a vain hope, but the family keeps
regenerating its mistaken urge to belong, once the family
establishes itself comfortably in a beautifully burnished turn of
the century world on the strength of a patent medicine. The
elixir's formula is borne to Budapest by Emmanuel, sewn into the
lining of his coat when he leaves his village. But Emmanuel passes
on a desire to be respectable, and it keeps costing his family.
This is where Ralph Fiennes comes in. His contribution would in the
hands of other actors be called a tour de force. But showiness is
antithetical to Fiennes. He plays Emmanuel's son, grandson, and
great-grandson with fire, but it's interiorized, except when it
erupts in a passionate sex scene, which happens once in each
character's life.
</P>
<P>
   Emmanuel's son, Ignatz, becomes a lawyer and judge, but at the
cost of his identity. He changes his name from Sonnenschein (German
for Sunshine) to Sors (Hungarian for destiny). He also converts to
Catholicism. It works so far as his career goes. He gets his
judgeship and even an audience with Emperor Franz Josef as he goes
off to World War I, but his personal life crumbles. Jennifer Ehle's
Valerie, a free spirit who is his cousin and was raised as his
sister when her own father died, is passionately drawn to him. She
acts on her passion. He responds, and they marry, despite the
misgivings of his parents. But when Ignatz makes his deal, she
denounces him as a sellout, comparing him unfavorably to his social
reformer firebrand brother, Gustave.
</P>
<P>
   In the next generation, Fiennes turns up as Ignatz's son, Adam,
who becomes a champion fencer, but finds his advancement blocked
and must make the same decision as his father as Hungary cozies up
to the Nazis. So, too, does Adam's son, Ivan, also played by
Fiennes. In contrast to Adam's fiery elegance, Ivan is a grim
ideologue, driven by guilt at having survived World War II when his
father didn't and determined to revenge himself on fascists as a
communist witch-hunter. Until, of course, he, too, finds politics
blowing up in his face. Each man in each generation is guilty of
moral or emotional betrayal, and Fiennes impressively
dimensionalizes all of them.
</P>
<P>
   Such dimension is needed because while Szabo's partly
autobiographical chronicle has breadth, it can't always be said to
have equivalent depth. As the years pile up, its schematic nature
becomes ever more apparent and the characters threaten to grow
emblematic. One big reason the last part, depicting Ivan's struggle
to replenish his soul by making contact with his roots, doesn't
evaporate is a pair of outstanding performances by William Hurt and
Rosemary Harris. Ehle's mother in real life, the invaluable Harris
plays Ehle's character, Valerie, in old age. Her serenity and
magisterial spirit buoy the film no end. So does Hurt's performance
as a damaged man, but a worthy one, who begins as Ivan's superior
and finds himself on the wrong end of a purge.
</P>
<P>
   In a film climate starved for substance, I wish I could be more
enthusiastic about Szabo's latest film. It's rich and committed.
It's studded with juicy performances. Its themes matter. Even the
sex scenes are urgent, especially the ones involving Ivan and
Deborah Kara Unger, whose status as the wife of another Party
member makes her a highly risky proposition, which possibly
contributes to their abandon. In short, there's much to admire
here, yet one can't help harboring reservations stemming from the
scanting of character development. The film sometimes
hyperventilates in an effort to put it there, and the characters
sometimes speak in comic-strip balloons, clumsily illustrating the
historic significance of what we're seeing. The Sonnenscheins pay a
heavy price to learn that you've got to be yourself, and
``Sunshine'' sometimes brings a heavy hand to their story. Still,
``Sunshine'' is a cinematic journey worth taking, even if it does
stumble.

GUITARIST BETTS SAYS HE'LL FIGHT DISMISSAL FROM ALLMANS BAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Scratch the ``brothers'' part of the Allman Brothers Band,
because things are turning ugly. Guitarist Dickey Betts, a founding
member and the backbone of the group along with Gregg Allman, has
been kicked off the summer tour. Thursday Betts said he is planning
legal action against the remaining founders, claiming they are
``defrauding the public'' by touring without him.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The Allmans _ with replacement guitarist Jimmy Herring (who
last toured with Phil Lesh) _ &UR;  &LR; were to perform Friday at the
Tweeter Center in Massachusetts without Betts, who has sung and
written many Allmans tunes during the last three decades, including
``Blue Sky'' and ``Ramblin' Man.''
</P>
<P>
   The band has issued a statement citing ``creative differences''
with Betts, but Gregg Allman conceded this week that Betts has a
drinking problem and ``when it starts to affect the music,
something has to be done about it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing how one person's disease can affect the band so
much,'' said Allman. ``And I'm not overlooking the fact that I've
had problems with the stuff myself. . . . I almost got laid off
from the band at one point. It took my wife leaving me, then I
sobered up. She's the right one for me, and I got her back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud to say that I've been 3 1/2 years sober and I don't
even smoke anymore,'' said Allman. ``Maybe this is what it will
take to get (Betts) back together. . . . He'll be back, I think,
but it's all up to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Betts, however, adamantly denied that he has a drinking problem
(``I have a couple of drinks with the guys, but that's it'') and
said he has been playing better than he has in years. He cited
reviews of shows this year, including a New York Times review of
the Allmans at the Beacon Theater in Manhattan that said, ``Mr.
Betts lifted the band with him, as the music shook off its past to
shimmer in the present.''
</P>
<P>
   Allman countered by saying ``the hardest scrutinizing of the
music has to be done by us'' and ``there's a lot of stuff the
public doesn't notice, but that a musician of 40 years does.''
Betts had also been replaced briefly in 1993 (starting with a show
at Great Woods, now the Tweeter Center) after he'd been arrested in
Syracuse, N.Y., following a domestic quarrel.
</P>
<P>
   Betts said the band notified him of this latest summer
suspension via an ``impersonal fax.'' Allman said the group called
Betts to arrange a meeting, but ``he got arrested.'' Betts said he
wasn't arrested, but, at his wife's request, checked into a crisis
intervention center June 3 near his home in Sarasota, Fla., for
treatment of depression. This occurred two weeks after he was
suspended.
</P>
<P>
   A police report from the Sarasota County sheriff's office said
that ``a husband and wife'' were having problems that night and
that the husband broke a television and overturned a couch. He then
left and the wife asked for help in finding him. Chuck Lesaltato of
the sheriff's office confirmed for rollingstone.com that Betts was
the husband, but Lesaltato was not available for comment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff's report does not mention an arrest, but does
mention that the husband was taken to the crisis intervention
center for psychiatric evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are saying a lot of things that aren't true,''
said Betts, who is most upset that none of the other founding
members of the band (Allman, Butch Trucks, and Jaimoe) has called
him. He said he phoned Allman twice, but Allman hung up on him each
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tough love'' is how Allman described the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Betts said he has been asked by Lesh, the former Grateful Dead
bassist, to do some shows together. For now, he is initiating legal
proceedings to question the trademark use of the name the Allman
Brothers. ``I don't see how they can take the band on the road and
call it the Allman Brothers Band. The people ought to know that I'm
not in the band when they buy the tickets.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the band intends to stop doing Betts's vocal tunes,
but still do some of his instrumentals, such as ``In Memory of
Elizabeth Reed.'' As for Herring, Allman said, ``He's not going to
play Dickey's stuff note for note. He has his own style and will
definitely have full rein.''
</P>
<P>
   Herring knows he has some major shoes to fill. ``Dickey's
melodies stuck in my head as a kid and made me want to play
music,'' he said. I'm looking at this as a nice summer outing. It
may turn into more, but I'm not expecting it. My wish is that
Dickey comes back.''

IMMIGRANTS

<P>
   LONDON _ Last Sunday night, British customs officers at the port
city of Dover became suspicious about a produce truck that had just
arrived by ferry from Holland.
</P>
<P>
   They opened the back of the truck to find crates of tomatoes.
Still suspicious, the officers used a forklift to unload a few
crates to see what lay behind.
</P>
<P>
   One officer shimmied over the remaining stacks of tomatoes. To
his horror, the hot, darkened compartment contained the bodies of
58 Chinese immigrants. Two others were still alive.
</P>
<P>
   The 56 men and four women had paid up to US$30,000 each to be
smuggled into Britain, probably in search of jobs where they could
make more in a month than they could in a year in China.
</P>
<P>
   However, the truck's ventilation system had been was switched
off Sunday afternoon, a rare day when temperatures soared above 90
degrees. The air-tight produce compartment became a hot, airless
death chamber.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the truck's Dutch driver was charged with 58 counts
of manslaughter, and police were questioning other suspects in what
authorities believe is one of many well-organized cells of refugee
smugglers known as ``snakeheads.''
</P>
<P>
   The deaths come at a time when Europeans are struggling to come
to grips with the growing influx of immigrants from Asia and
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The Geneva-based International Organization for Migration
estimates that as many as 400,000 illegal immigrants enter Europe
each year _ about 100,000 more than the United States.
</P>
<P>
   From Africa they come across the broad expanse of southern
Spain, which is known as the ``southern gate,'' Europe's version of
the Rio Grande.
</P>
<P>
   From Asia, they travel the arduous route through Russia and
eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Once in the European Union, they can move between countries
without documents as most border passport stops have been removed.
Britain is one of the few EU members that still checks passports at
the border, forcing immigrants without documents to find other
means of entry.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the United States, which was built by immigrants seeking
opportunity, European countries are still struggling with the
demands of becoming multicultural.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, public opinion in Europe has shifted against
immigrants, who are regarded by many as poor foreigners trying to
sponge off richer countries.
</P>
<P>
   Europe, again, unlike America, has little infrastructure for
assimilating people with different languages and religions. Polls
show many Europeans are convinced that illegal immigration is out
of control, and is likely to become worse.
</P>
<P>
   Voters respond favorably these days to the inflammatory
anti-immigration rhetoric of Austria's Jorge Haider, Denmark's Pia
Kjaersgaard and France's Jean Marie Le Pen.
</P>
<P>
   Even moderate politicians have responded to the concerns and
have pushed for tougher immigration rules and enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   However, advocates for refugees believe these new restrictions
only make it more likely that immigrants will go underground.
Consequently, they say that blame for the dreadful episode in Dover
must be shared not only by the gangs that traffic in human cargo
but also by European politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Khalid Koser of London University's Migration Research Center
believes the trend of anti-immigration policies have boosted a
market for refugee smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main reason illegal immigration appears to be growing is
that restrictive immigration policies have increased, making it
difficult for people to arrive in Europe legally,'' Koser said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt that these criminal gangs are now going out
and marketing themselves, telling people they will be able to get
them into Europe,'' Koser said, ``and because it is more difficult
to get visas they are able to charge higher fees.''
</P>
<P>
   The push to stem the flow of immigrants has curtailed one
traditional avenue, claiming political asylum. Across Europe, about
350,000 people applied for asylum in 1999 _ a 20 percent jump over
1998. But fewer requests are being approved, and governments are
trying to end the practice of using applications to enter a country
legally and never leaving.
</P>
<P>
   Britain denied most of the 75,000 applications it received last
year, but two-thirds of the applicants had in the meantime
disappeared into their ethnic communities.
</P>
<P>
   After being criticized by Conservative Party opponents, British
Prime Minister Tony Blair's government recently vowed to deport
many asylum seekers and jail others while their requests are
processed.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative leaders believe their attack on asylum applicants
has found a receptive audience among voters in Britain worried
about what party leader William Hague described as a ``flood of
bogus asylum seekers.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the political climate, European governments are more
interested in stopping new migrants than catching the masterminds
behind the illegal trade, Koser said.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, ``the big danger if they crack down on illegal
immigrants is that they will also close down the routes used by
genuine refugees to flee from persecution.''
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, almost all unskilled people now are excluded from
entry to the United Kingdom, despite the country's deeply valued
position as a harbor for persecuted people, said Nick Hardwick of
Britain's Refugee Council. ``It is virtually impossible for people
fleeing persecution to enter Britain legally,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, they are forced to resort to desperate measures.
</P>
<P>
   The migrants found in Dover came from Fujian province, a
southern coastal province with a rich history of its people
migrating abroad. In some villages, 10 percent of the population
has left, according to the International Organization for
Migration.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 50 international crime groups are involved in
organized refugee trafficking, officials say. The term for them _
``snakeheads'' _ comes from a gang based in Fujian province.
</P>
<P>
   Migrant smuggling has become big business. ``The profit these
criminals can make by smuggling humans in, rather than drugs, is
now very, very substantial,'' Jack Straw, the British Home
Secretary, told Parliament last Monday.
</P>
<P>
   To repay smuggling fees of US$20,000 to US$60,000, many
immigrants work in the service and garment industries. They find
housing with established family members.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 800,000 ethnic Chinese live in Europe, with most
making their homes in Britain _ about 250,000 _ and France _ about
200,000.
</P>
<P>
   Although the United States has been the favored destination for
smuggled ethnic Chinese, there are indications that Europe is
becoming a more attractive destination, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, European officials are trying to slow immigration
at a time when the continent is in need of fresh blood.
</P>
<P>
   Because of a low birth rate, the European Union's population
growth is the lowest since World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, many European countries face the prospect of
developing a population imbalance with a surplus of older people
and a shortage of younger people do to the work.
</P>
<P>
   In 50 years Germany, which is becoming more and more dependent
on foreigners for its labor force, is expected to have more
retirees than workers.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations in late March estimated that Europe may need
as many as 150 million new immigrants by 2025 to maintain the
present levels of working and tax-paying communities.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Hall, the research director at the Centre for European
Reforms, believes that in time, the EU may need to attract
immigrants, setting annual quotas for newcomers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Europe's population is falling,'' Hall said. ``If you take
Italy as an example, the Italian population is estimated to fall by
28 percent by the middle of this century.''
</P>
<P>
   While many political leaders are trying to clamp down on
immigration, others warn about the long-term consequences.
</P>
<P>
   In a February speech, former Italian Minister Massimo D'Alema
urged his countrymen to end their fear of immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we close the door to immigration,'' D'Alema said, ``we
would make our country poorer.''

&HT;     POLITICAL ANALYSTS SAY BUSH ISN'T HURT BY SUPPORTING DEATH
PENALTY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By PETTY FIKAC  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Knocked by death penalty protesters while on the
presidential campaign trail, Texas Gov. George W. Bush isn't likely
to lose votes because of his support of the death penalty,
political analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a burning issue. It's momentarily an issue because
the media doesn't have anything else to talk about,'' said Mark
Petracca, chairman of the political science department at the
University of California at Irvine.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking from a state where Bush is fighting hard against
Democratic Vice President Al Gore, Petracca predicted the Gary
Graham story would disappear from newspapers' front pages with
``the first airplane tragedy of the summer or boating tragedy or
celebrity killed or celebrity divorced.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush has got the standard right line here, which is, `I'm
following the law,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Graham was executed in Hunstville, Texas, Thursday night amid a
clamor of protests that he was innocent of the 1981 murder he was
convicted of committing in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Political experts predicted little or no backlash for Bush as
long as he appears to be handling the issue consistently and
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politically, it's a wash,'' said Bruce Buchanan, a political
scientist at the University of Texas at Austin. ``I don't see it
doing him any great harm or any particular good, although it could
reinforce his image for decisively standing firm under pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush will face 14 more executions in the state before Election
Day.
</P>
<P>
   The death penalty won't be a factor with ``the overwhelming
majority of Americans who are in favor of capital punishment,''
said Matthew Felling of the Washington-based Center for Media and
Public Affairs, which does content analyses of news and
entertainment media.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also is a death-penalty supporter, Felling noted.
</P>
<P>
   The worst damage done to Bush over the death penalty came after
he was reported to have spoken in a mocking way about murderer and
born-again Christian Karla Faye Tucker's plea to live, Felling and
others said.
</P>
<P>
   A Bush spokeswoman has said Bush's demeanor was misinterpreted
and that he took the Tucker case seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he really understands now he cannot appear to be
taking that issue lightly,'' said Allan Saxe, a political scientist
at the University of Texas at Arlington. ``The issue of leadership
and seriousness is very important.''
</P>
<P>
   Questions have been raised nationally about the general quality
of legal representation at trial for Texans given the death
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   A number of Texas officials, including Attorney General John
Cornyn, have defended the state's process as fair.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the state's Democratic U.S. representatives have urged
Bush to place a moratorium on executions until a study can be done
of capital punishment here.
</P>
<P>
   The governor of Illinois has done so in his state.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's office said he doesn't have the authority to
independently change death sentences or stop executions.
</P>
<P>
   He only can grant a one-time, 30-day reprieve unless his
appointed Board of Pardons and Paroles recommends otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Bush recently did this for the first time in a case involving
DNA testing.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest case to draw high-profile attention, that of
Graham, who was defended by such well-known figures as the Rev.
Jesse Jackson, officials said Bush couldn't even grant a reprieve
without board action.
</P>
<P>
   That's because former Gov. Ann Richards previously had granted
Graham an independent reprieve.
</P>
<P>
   ``This does highlight the weakness of the gubernatorial office
in Texas,'' said Dennis Goldford, chairman of the department of
politics and international relations at Drake University in Des
Moines.
</P>
<P>
   ``For all that Bush talks about leadership, the governor's
office in Texas, relative to that in other states, is fairly
weak,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Goldford said at worst the Texas death penalty issue at this
point is only ``slightly negative'' for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``It puts him on the defensive a little bit,'' he said. ``Bush
has been setting the agenda of the campaign so far, and Gore has
been responding to Bush. This doesn't knock Bush off stride. It
slows down his offense.''

   SAN LEANDRO, Calif. _ Jean Hillery was a grandmother of four and
master swimmer who volunteered to teach young kids at a local pool
near her Alameda, Calif., home.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Quadros of Hayward, Calif., was an avid Red Sox fan and
golfer who helped build a skateboard park last year.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Shaline, a father of three from Sacramento, Calif., loved
his job of more than 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   The three investigators, together having more than 60 years of
experience working to ensure meat safety, were gunned down
Wednesday at a San Leandro, Calif., sausage factory. All worked in
jobs little glimpsed by the public, government positions that took
them to the unglamorous sites of slaughterhouses, meat packing
plants, grocery store back rooms and garages stacked with animal
carcasses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to tease her about how she could go to the
slaughterhouses,'' said Joan Thompson, a longtime friend of
Hillery. ``She liked the investigative part of it. She felt she was
contributing, which is something she always did. She was a
contributor, not a taker.''
</P>
<P>
   Alvin Riley, a lab support worker at the U.S. Department of
Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service in Alameda,
described Hillery as ``very positive and very outgoing.'' But she
was also known as a stickler.
</P>
<P>
   ``She believed in sticking to the rules,'' Riley said. ``She
didn't believe in shortcuts. You come in and put in your hours. You
didn't leave five minutes early.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley said he couldn't believe the news of her death.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was shock _ that's the first word that came out of my
mouth,'' he said. ``It was something that was needless _ needless
tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   In her spare time outside of work, Hillery, 56, was treasurer of
the Alameda Swimming Pool Association, a private nonprofit
organization that ran a pool where young kids flocked for swimming
lessons. On Tuesday, the day before the shooting rampage that ended
her life, she showed up to teach young kids water skills.
</P>
<P>
   Hillery had earned her undergraduate degree from the University
of Phoenix late in life, after raising her three daughters,
according to Dave Warner, the father of one of Hillery's
sons-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was real proud of that,'' said Warner.
</P>
<P>
   Born and raised in Alameda, Hillery at one time worked for the
Navy in a civilian job, then later went to work for the U.S.
Department of Agriculture. Several years ago she was promoted to
the job of compliance officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We asked her if she were ever nervous and she said no, it
didn't frighten her,'' said Thompson. ``She talked about going into
peoples' garages and into grocery stores that packed their own
meat. She never seemed to be wary of anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Quadros, 52, her colleague, had worked for the department
for 27 years, according to his son Chris. Unlike Hillery, Quadros
had expressed his concerns to his son and a longtime friend in
Michigan, who says Quadros thought compliance officers should be
allowed to carry arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he needed protection,'' said Dan Masta, who has known
Quadros more than 30 years, since the two worked at a Michigan bar
together.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Department of Agriculture special agent-in-charge David
Dickson said Hillery and Quadros, as compliance officers, were
charged with making random, unscheduled visits to food preparation
facilities, including the Santos Linguisa Factory, where the
shootings took place. Compliance officers often focus on sites that
have a history of problems or compliance issues. They also pursue
tips from the general public or employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``They often go in unannounced. They sometimes set up an
appointment to talk about problems that they may have had in the
past,'' Dickson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compliance officers work on a roving basis. They travel
throughout the area and make visits.''
</P>
<P>
   Masta recalled Quadros' love of baseball _ expressed in his work
as a coach, a fervent collector of baseball cards and fan of the
Boston Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Quadros said his father's house was decorated with
memorabilia from the Red Sox, the team he began following during
his childhood in Dedham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   He said his father was promoted from inspector to compliance
officer three years ago and loved his job.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was widely accepted as the best at what he did,'' said
Chris Quadros. ``He had supervisors from Washington calling him for
advice. He loved being able to make a difference in helping people,
in knowing that because of what he was doing people might not get
sick and die.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year Thomas Quadros volunteered his time to help build a
skateboard park in Alameda so kids there would have a safe place to
ride their boards. He was close to his 22-year-old son, who had
been living with him.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of his death, Quadros was house-sitting for his
brother and sister-in-law, who were in Europe. He called his son
Wednesday morning and left a message that he was visiting the
Santos Linguisa Factory. That was the last time Chris ever heard
his father's voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw the news, I immediately thought, `Oh no,'''said
Chris Quadros. ``I called my uncle's house and he just didn't
answer. I drove over there and there was a card from the FBI. I
knew that my dad was gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Deven Shaline also lost his father Wednesday. Bill Shaline, 57,
was remembered by California Department of Food and Agriculture
Secretary William Lyons Jr. as ``one of our lesser-known heroes,''
a senior special investigator called in from his department's
Sacramento office to help in the ongoing investigation at the
Santos factory.
</P>
<P>
   ``His compassion and commitment to a very important job were
keys to his outstanding performance over the many years he worked
to ensure a safe food supply for Californians,'' said Lyons.
</P>
<P>
   Said Deven Shaline, one of Bill Shaline's three kids, ``My dad
was a great man. He loved his job.''

&HT;     CUBA BETS ITS ECONOMY ON TOURISM

<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA, Cuba _ This island nation, playing up its tropical good
times and rogue reputation, is in the midst of a tourist bonanza
and wants to lure even more visitors this year.
</P>
<P>
   Fidel Castro expects a boost in tourism dollars to help Cuba's
11.1 million people climb out of the economic hole created by the
40-year-old U.S. trade embargo and the loss of Soviet bloc
subsidies early in the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   The new optimism comes at a time when the House is expected to
vote on easing the embargo banning U.S.-Cuba trade by permitting
sales of American food, medicine and medical supplies to Havana.
The Senate has passed a similar bill.
</P>
<P>
   If approved this week, the House measure would have little
immediate impact on Cuba's balance sheet, experts say. While
allowing the limited sales by U.S. companies, the bill would still
forbid Cuba to sell its goods to the United States and would not
allow Havana to buy on credit.
</P>
<P>
   But Cuba, which buys rice and other commodities from Asia, might
save some money on transportation costs since U.S. suppliers are
much closer.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the current embargo, $3 billion in direct foreign
investment has flowed into Cuba in the past 18 months, according to
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Last year, 1.6 million tourists _
60,000 of them Americans _ infused a record $1.9 billion into
Cuba's dollar-starved economy _ more than double the 1992 level.
Cuban officials hope the number of visitors will top 2 million this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would then be in the big leagues,'' said Tourism Ministry
adviser Miguel Alejandro Figueras, adding that only 40 nations in
the world receive more than 2 million visitors annually.
</P>
<P>
   Tourism has surfaced as an antidote to the economic double
whammy that followed Castro's seizure of power in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. embargo set Cuba adrift from its major trading partner.
And the downfall of the Soviet bloc between 1989 and 1991 meant the
loss of massive subsidies and trade worth more than $2 billion
annually.
</P>
<P>
   Those were dark times, literally. Cubans suffered through
frequent blackouts because of the government's cost-cutting actions
restricting the use of electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Food was scarce. Tourist guide Carlos Aguiar recalls losing 40
pounds and looking emaciated. ``And I wasn't on a diet or
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Cuba has reinvented itself as a dollar-based
economy, open to foreign trade, tourism and investment even while
it remains a centrally planned communist state.
</P>
<P>
   This city's skyline is dotted with new and renovated hotels,
some run by foreign firms under management contracts and others
under construction as Cuban joint ventures with European and
Canadian hotel chains. An Italian company has also overhauled the
island's telephone system.
</P>
<P>
   While Cuba is nowhere near China in opening up its economy to
free enterprise, it has transferred most of its state-owned farm
land to semi-autonomous farmer cooperatives and individual owners.
Cubans can run restaurants out of their homes and charge fees for
giving private lessons in foreign languages.
</P>
<P>
   Economically, Cuba is still in a slump. It exports about $1.4
billion in sugar, nickel, cigars and other products. It imports $3
billion, much of it food, oil and other necessities on credit.
Tourism surpassed sugar in the 1990s as Cuba's main source of
revenue, providing funds that are crucial to the island's efforts
to join the world dollar economy.
</P>
<P>
   In a nominally egalitarian society, the new economy has created
a curious class division based not on education or party membership
but on access to dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Cubans who work in hotels, restaurants and other places
frequented by tourists get dollars in tips and can buy hundreds of
consumer items that most Cubans cannot afford.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the physician or lawyer or engineer who wants to be at
the hotel's front door getting the bags of tourists,'' says
Figueras. ``There are a lot of jokes about that.''
</P>
<P>
   At hotels some Cubans strike up conversations with tourists and
then offer them boxes of cigars at cut-rate prices provided the
buyers pay in dollars.
</P>
<P>
   In a 98-year-old tobacco factory here workers hold up individual
cigars to visitors and mutter, ``One dollar, one dollar.''
</P>
<P>
   Without dollars, life can be bleak. Reynaldo Jimenez, a social
sciences professor, and his wife, Mercedes, a dermatologist, have a
combined income in pesos equal to about $18.50 a month. Medical
care and education are free, and with rationing cards, food costs
little.
</P>
<P>
   The Jimenezes live in a small apartment at the top of three
flights of unlit stairs. Asked to recommend a nearby restaurant for
an evening meal, Reynaldo cannot say because he and Mercedes never
go out to eat.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt that a family is better off if its income is
in dollars,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Those with relatives in the United States can receive up to
$1,200 a year in cash, a fortune for the average Cuban. In all,
Cubans receive about $900 million from their relatives annually.
</P>
<P>
   Economic improvement is difficult to measure. In Havana,
tourists are shocked by the tattered condition of streets, houses
and windowless, one-room apartments.
</P>
<P>
   But Cubans like to boast that everything is becoming up-to-date
on their island. They note with pride that five years ago the
government, desperate for revenue, started taxing private income _
just like other nations.
</P>
<P>
   To build up tourism, Cuba has invested $400 million in airports
in the past 10 years to make all parts of the island accessible.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Figueras laments that much more must be done to develop
restaurants, nightclubs, sports facilities and other tourist
attractions. ``We have no theme parks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, Cuban-American opponents of Castro are
fighting hard to prevent Congress from easing the embargo. Noting
that Cuba is often slow to pay for the items it has bought from
other countries, they call it a deadbeat nation.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Sorzano, a leading anti-Castro spokesman and a former
national security official in the Ronald Reagan administration,
warns that if the United States eases the embargo, ``the American
taxpayer will be asked to foot the bill'' sometime in the future
when Castro cannot pay.
</P>
<P>
   But many American entrepreneurs see Cuba as a risk worth taking.
</P>
<P>
   ``People all around world are selling products to Cuba and
getting paid,'' said L. Craig Johnstone, a former State Department
official in the Reagan and Clinton administrations and now a vice
president at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. ``Would you as a
business person have to keep an eye on your business? Yes. It's an
impoverished nation, but clearly there are a number of
possibilities there.''

   ELIAN _ ATLANTA _ The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals will
issue a ruling today at 3 p.m. EDT, probably on the court's
decision on whether to rehear the Elian Gonzalez case or not. If it
decides to reconsider the three-judge panel's ruling, it will
likely schedule another hearing. If it declines to reconsider it,
the case will then very likely be appealed to the U.S. Supreme
Court. (Rankin, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

been mayor for a quarter century, Joseph Riley defends what he
calls Charleston's ``strategic'' economic development. But each big
project, such as the $69 million state aquarium that opened last
month, brings more tourists. And some in Charleston complain that
the city risks losing the charm that, year after year, places it on
the list of most hospitable U.S. cities. ``What a great aquarium is
a science museum,'' Riley counters, ``and great cities have art

   BKN-DRAFT-MIHM _ AUSTIN _ Orlando Magic General Manager John
Gabriel has two words for those who would dismiss Chris Mihm
offhand as unfit to play center effectively in the NBA. Brad
Daugherty. Gabriel considers Daugherty a cautionary tale for those
taking measure of NBA draft prospects. Daugherty, a college star at
North Carolina in the mid-1980s, was widely considered to lack the
toughness necessary to work near the basket as a pro. As NBA scouts
took measure of him, Daugherty was tattooed with the ``S'' word _
too soft. Based on that reputation, Philadelphia, which had the No.
1 pick in the 1986 draft, traded it to Cleveland. As it turned out,
Daugherty became one of the better centers in the NBA. Using skill
and athleticism more than muscle and intimidation, Daugherty became
a five-time all-star, averaging 19 points a game before his career
was cut short after eight seasons because of a back injury.
Gabriel, voted the NBA's top executive this season, says, ``I think
you have to be careful when you label people soft. I was part of
that staff in Philadelphia. We could have drafted Daugherty, but
there were concerns that he was too soft.''Chris Mihm is an NBA
player. (Rosner, Austin American-Statesman). 49. WITH FILE PHOTO.

January, 1998. Hoping to move back into the first round, the Spurs
will offer the two second-round picks they hold, Nos. 41 and 54
overall. The 41st pick was acquired in a trade with Dallas last
year. No. 54 is the Spurs' own second-round slot.The Spurs, who do
not have a first-rounder, may try to trade two seconds for a first.

&HT;     JETS IN KOREAN WAR CHANGED THE WAY WARS ARE FOUGHT

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Air Force Capt. Ralph Parr, flying high over MiG
Alley, should have been fazed by the odds. It was he and one other
F-86 pilot, after all, against 16 MiG-15s.
</P>
<P>
   And it became 16-to-1 on July 7, 1953, when he pushed forward on
his stick and dived from 43,000 feet to near ground level, losing
his wingman somewhere on the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``The end of the war was upon us, you know, and this might be my
only opportunity,'' said Parr, now 75, of New Braunfels, Texas.
``It was sort of, in for a penny, in for a pound.''
</P>
<P>
   That day, he shot down two MiGs, damaged another and chased off
the rest.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the Korean War was over, Parr had carved a niche in
American fighter-ace history by shooting down 10 enemy aircraft in
30 missions. A double ace might rack up those numbers over 150
missions or so, perhaps more.
</P>
<P>
   But this was a new war _ the war of jets.
</P>
<P>
   With the advent of the turbojet engine, aerial combat never
would be the same.
</P>
<P>
   The two jets most often associated with Korea are the F-86 and
the MiG-15 _ and the fast and agile Sabrejet in time ruled the sky,
earning an 8-to-1 kill ratio, said the Air Force's Pentagon
historian, Dick Hallion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our guys knew it,'' said retired Brig. Gen. Frank Gailer, 76,
of San Antonio, a World War II ace with 5 1/2 kills. ``They all
knew the Russians and Chinese were flying. That was no real
secret.''
</P>
<P>
   One Russian, Maj. Gen. Sergei M. Kramarenko, was an ace when he
came to Korea in April 1951, having shot down 13 planes in World
War II. Before he left the peninsula, Kramarenko would claim 13
more, nine of them F-86s, before being downed himself.
</P>
<P>
   Two of his victories came Dec. 1, 1951, when Kramarenko was
among 16 Russian pilots who shot down 20 Royal Australian Air Force
F-8 Gloster Meteor jets.
</P>
<P>
   The slower Meteor, a first-generation jet developed years
before, was no match for a MiG. Parr likened the duel to a Corvette
racing a Ford Model A. Making matters worse, the Meteors were
oblivious to the danger as they opened a ground support mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't see us and they began to attack the town,''
Kramarenko, 77, said during visit to San Antonio earlier this year.
``I was behind them, so we started shooting and shot two of them.''
</P>
<P>
   It was one of the worst days of the war for allied fliers, but
there was plenty of misery to go around.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the conflict Parr, a forward air controller, went into
hiding when his position west of the Chosin Reservoir was overrun.
From the top of a hill, he watched Chinese troops capture two
fellow controllers, then force them to their knees. The enemy
troops shot the airmen in the back of their heads and rolled the
corpses into a ditch.
</P>
<P>
   American pilots faced the problem of trying to stop North Korean
troops from advancing in the midst of refugees. In August 1950, the
soldiers donned long robes worn by Koreans for centuries, and mixed
with refugees massing on the Naktong River near an American base in
Taegu.
</P>
<P>
   Retired Lt. Col. Duane E. ``Bud'' Biteman described his anguish
in ``Hot Shots,'' an oral history of the Korean air war. Nothing in
his military experience had prepared him for the prospect of
killing civilians. He flew his P-51 Mustang low and fired warning
shots.
</P>
<P>
   For soldiers on the ground, support from P-51s often meant the
difference between life and death, especially after the Chinese
entered the war.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the war ended, American pilots logged 900 confirmed
air-to-air kills over 710,886 sorties and dropped 772 million
pounds of bombs.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. air power was credited by those on both sides with staving
off the initial North Korean offensive and later keeping hundreds
of thousands of Chinese from running the allies off the peninsula.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ This year's San Francisco Gay Pride Parade puts
its future right up front _ after the dykes on bikes, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Queer youth, the young men and women who weren't even born for
the 1969 Stonewall rebellion honored by gay freedom day
celebrations around the country, will set the tone for San
Francisco Pride 2000, which culminates with Sunday's mondo parade.
</P>
<P>
   If size matters, San Francisco's 30th annual demonstration of
gay liberation is the biggest in the world, with 220 contingents
and half a million to three-quarters of a million people taking
part or watching.
</P>
<P>
   Once again this year, it promises to induce gasps, laughter,
tears and some yawns with its four hours of political courage and
sheer outrageousness.
</P>
<P>
   The Women's Motorcycle Contingent kick-starts things at 10:30
a.m., heading west up Market Street from the Bay to the Civic
Center, where festivities last all afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   This year's emphasis on youth is intentional, going with the
theme ``It's About Freedom,'' according to parade organizer Teddy
Witherington, who was brought in three years ago to give the
world's most famous gay pride celebration a professional feel.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the changes on his watch have raised protests that the
freewheeling liberationist roots of San Francisco's parade are
being poisoned by overcommercialization.
</P>
<P>
   The budget has risen to about $850,000, with only a small
percentage returned to community groups. Post-parade festivities at
the Civic Center are being fenced off for the second year, with $3
donations requested.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, there's only one dot-com contingent.
</P>
<P>
   The number of stages at the Civic Center is up to 10, including
new youth/techno, Asian Pacific Islander and swing dance stages.
Performers include Olive (``I'm Not in Love'') and Ann Nesby
(``Love is What We Need''), both currently on Billboard's Top 10
dance chart.
</P>
<P>
   The parade is the centerpiece of a month of gay, lesbian,
bisexual and transgender celebration in San Francisco, including
the annual film festival, parties, art exhibits and a beauty
pageant. Saturday, a rally against hate and a mass commitment
ceremony will take place in the Civic Center.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night's Dyke March, in its eighth year, has expanded
into an afternoon of entertainment and a rally at Dolores Park.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the weekend, PFLAG (Parents, Families and Friends of
Lesbians and Gays) will be co-sponsoring a domestic partners
registration booth at the Civic Center. It aims to sign up enough
couples to make a point to legislators considering gay-rights laws.

   DRUG-ADDICTION (Undated) _ The debate about whether drug
addiction is a disease: Dr. Alan I. Leshner, the director of the
National Institute on Drug Abuse, says that the brain of an addict
is fundamentally different from that of a nonaddict. Initially,
when a person uses hard drugs like heroin or cocaine, the chemistry
of the brain is not much affected, and the decision to take the
drugs remains voluntary. But at a certain point, he says, a
``metaphorical switch in the brain'' gets thrown, and the
individual moves into a state of addiction characterized by
compulsive drug use. These brain changes, Leshner says, persist
long after addicts stop using drugs, which is why, he continues,
relapse is so common. Addiction, Leshner declares, should be
approached more like other chronic illnesses, such as diabetes and
hypertension. Going further, he says that drugs so alter the brain
that addiction can be compared to mental disorders like Alzheimer's
disease and schizophrenia. It is, he says, a ``brain disease.'' By

&HT;     THE FORD SVT LIGHTNING IS A HOT TRUCK 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ After a few minutes _ no, actually, just a few
seconds _ behind the wheel of the Ford F-150 SVT Lightning pickup,
this week's test drive, I was glad of two things.
</P>
<P>
   One: That it is not often that I get vehicles like this to test
drive, otherwise I would get into trouble.
</P>
<P>
   And two: That there was no traffic cop riding behind me when I
goosed the gas the first time and this vehicle scratched off like,
well, greased lightning.
</P>
<P>
   This is, without a doubt, one of the two hottest trucks I've
ever driven; the other was the 1991GMC Sonoma Syclone.
</P>
<P>
   Ford says the Lightning will go from zero to 60 mph in just 5.4
seconds, and I believe it. I also believe that it probably would
take less than 10 seconds to go from zero to impound, especially if
that traffic cop really is behind the Lightning.
</P>
<P>
   In more than 15 years of testing cars and writing about them,
this is one of the most fun vehicles I've had the pleasure of
driving.
</P>
<P>
   The Lightning probably is the fastest production-model truck in
the world, and I know it is one of the fastest street-legal
vehicles I've ever driven.
</P>
<P>
   If I had kept it much longer than the week I had it, I probably
would have gotten some kind of ticket, as careful as I was. This
truck likes to run, and it really is hard to rein in. With just
light pressure on the accelerator, this baby jumps out and starts
moving like quail coming out of a bush. And without even knowing
it, you're way beyond the speed limit.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure how practical all of that power is in this country,
where the highest legal speed limit is 75 mph (and just 70 here in
Texas). This truck really needs a place to run, and public highways
just aren't appropriate. I would probably want to make arrangements
with General Manager Eddie Gossage at the Texas Motor Speedway in
Fort Worth to let me take this baby around the track occasionally,
just to blow the carbon out of the cylinders.
</P>
<P>
   As far as that goes, perhaps anyone considering purchasing the
Lightning should arrange for some regular track time at a nearby
speedway, or at least put a good traffic lawyer on retainer.
</P>
<P>
   SVT stands for ``special vehicle team,'' which is a group of
Ford Motor Co. car nuts who have been given free rein to take
ordinary, everyday vehicles and make them special, both in
appearance and performance _ but with the emphasis clearly on
performance.
</P>
<P>
   This team has reinvented the Mustang Cobra, the compact Contour
sedan and a handful of other Ford vehicles. But I don't think any
of those compares to the good looks and extraordinary performance
of the Lightning, the true truck lover's truck.
</P>
<P>
   Ford says it doesn't really make money on these
limited-production vehicles, because development costs far outstrip
what the company charges the consumer for the privilege of owning
one. The value to the company, officials say, is the
public-relations boost that these special vehicles give to Ford.
</P>
<P>
   And you will pay dearly for the right to own a Lightning. List
price for our test vehicle was $31,400, including $690
transportation. In comparison, you could buy a base model F-150
with a V-6 engine for not much more than half of that.
</P>
<P>
   But, hey, this is a special vehicle, make no mistake about it.
That base model F-150 will look like a pup if it challenges you to
a (legal) duel.
</P>
<P>
   One look under the hood of the Lightning, and you'll understand
why. It has a supercharged version of Ford's 5.4-liter Triton V-8
engine, rated at a whopping 360 horsepower and 440 foot-pounds of
torque. That's 100 horsepower more than in the regularly aspirated
5.4-liter engine, and way more than the 205 horsepower of the V-6
engine.
</P>
<P>
   The SVT engineers added a forged-steel crankshaft, forged-alloy
connecting rods and forged pistons, and lowered the compression
ratio to 8.4:1 to allow addition of the Roots-type supercharger,
which sits on top of the intake system. That's as technical as I'm
going to get.
</P>
<P>
   This engine is connected to a heavy-duty four-speed automatic
transmission from the Super Duty F-series; no ordinary transmission
would do. There is no manual gearbox offered, though; that would
push performance even higher.
</P>
<P>
   There are some sports cars that can match or slightly exceed the
Lightning's performance, but not any pickups except perhaps that
1991 GMC Syclone, which came with a 4.3-liter turbocharged V-6, and
was just about as quick.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the most practical truck, either, particularly if you
have a family to haul around. To ensure the best handling to go
along with the Lightning's speediness, the SVT engineers decided to
use a regular cab, short-bed, flare-side version of the F-150. You
can get three people in the front seat if you need to, but there is
no extended-cab version to allow you to take the kids along in the
rear seat.
</P>
<P>
   Round driving lights and a special front fascia design are
exclusive to the Lightning, which has the special ``Lightning''
badging on both front fenders in front of the doors.
</P>
<P>
   The interior is rather luxurious for a truck. The seats are
leather-covered, the door panels are leather, and there is a
leather-wrapped steering wheel. The driver's side has electric seat
controls.
</P>
<P>
   Other standard equipment included dual air bags with a
passenger-side cut-off switch; a premium AM/FM stereo with
single-disc in-dash CD player; dual electric remote-control outside
mirrors, four-wheel disc brakes with three-channel anti-lock
system; power windows and door locks; manual air-conditioning,
overhead console with electronic compass and exterior temperature
gauge; cruise control; remote keyless entry; and floor mats.
</P>
<P>
   Standard are eight-inch, five-spoke, cast-aluminum wheels and
special Goodyear Eagle tires _ Z-rated for high-speed operation.
There is a solid rear axle and a 3.55:1 limited-slip rear end; the
rear suspension has five-leaf springs, and there are gas-tuned
shock absorbers all around.
</P>
<P>
   Up front, there are coil springs and a solid stabilizer bar.
Steering is power-assisted recirculating ball type. The only
options offered are a soft cargo-bed cover ($150), towing package
($245) and an AM/FM/cassette stereo with six-disc remote CD changer
that fits behind the passenger seat ($210). Our test vehicle did
not have any of the options, however.
</P>
<P>
   To help ensure that no one steals the vehicle, the Lightning has
Ford's passive anti-theft system, which uses a tiny transponder
built into the ignition key, set to a special security code. It
must correspond to the code stored in the truck's engine computer;
if not, the vehicle won't run.
</P>
<P>
   Braking is awesome, which is a good thing for a vehicle that can
go 140 mph (I didn't try this; I'll take Ford's word for it). Ford
says the Lightning stops from 60 mph in just 137 feet, which is 10
feet more than it takes to stop the much-lighter SVT Mustang Cobra.
</P>
<P>
   EPA fuel-economy ratings are 13 miles per gallon in the city and
17 mpg on the highway. That's better than I thought they would be,
but they are calculated on driving this truck at posted speed
limits and with easy acceleration. Fat chance that's going to
happen.
</P>
<P>
   The tank holds 24.5 gallons of gasoline.

   FORGET TV'S `SURVIVOR.'
</P>
<P>
   HERE'S A SURVIVAL GUIDE FOR REAL LIFE.
</P>
<P>
   Life is tough for those people on ``Survivor.'' First they were
dumped into the sea. Then, on the island, they had to build
shelter, find food (rats, anyone?) and start a fire without
matches.
</P>
<P>
   But that's just a TV show. What if you found yourself adrift at
sea IN REAL LIFE? Would you know what to do?
</P>
<P>
   You would if you had read ``The WORST-CASE SCENARIO Survival
Handbook,'' a best seller designed to get you through those times
when life suddenly takes a turn for the worse.

&HT;     THE FORD SVT LIGHTNING IS A HOT TRUCK 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ After a few minutes _ no, actually, just a few
seconds _ behind the wheel of the Ford F-150 SVT Lightning pickup,
this week's test drive, I was glad of two things.
</P>
<P>
   One: That it is not often that I get vehicles like this to test
drive, otherwise I would get into trouble.
</P>
<P>
   And two: That there was no traffic cop riding behind me when I
goosed the gas the first time and this vehicle scratched off like,
well, greased lightning.
</P>
<P>
   This is, without a doubt, one of the two hottest trucks I've
ever driven; the other was the 1991GMC Sonoma Syclone.
</P>
<P>
   Ford says the Lightning will go from zero to 60 mph in just 5.4
seconds, and I believe it. I also believe that it probably would
take less than 10 seconds to go from zero to impound, especially if
that traffic cop really is behind the Lightning.
</P>
<P>
   In more than 15 years of testing cars and writing about them,
this is one of the most fun vehicles I've had the pleasure of
driving.
</P>
<P>
   The Lightning probably is the fastest production-model truck in
the world, and I know it is one of the fastest street-legal
vehicles I've ever driven.
</P>
<P>
   If I had kept it much longer than the week I had it, I probably
would have gotten some kind of ticket, as careful as I was. This
truck likes to run, and it really is hard to rein in. With just
light pressure on the accelerator, this baby jumps out and starts
moving like quail coming out of a bush. And without even knowing
it, you're way beyond the speed limit.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure how practical all of that power is in this country,
where the highest legal speed limit is 75 mph (and just 70 here in
Texas). This truck really needs a place to run, and public highways
just aren't appropriate. I would probably want to make arrangements
with General Manager Eddie Gossage at the Texas Motor Speedway in
Fort Worth to let me take this baby around the track occasionally,
just to blow the carbon out of the cylinders.
</P>
<P>
   As far as that goes, perhaps anyone considering purchasing the
Lightning should arrange for some regular track time at a nearby
speedway, or at least put a good traffic lawyer on retainer.
</P>
<P>
   SVT stands for ``special vehicle team,'' which is a group of
Ford Motor Co. car nuts who have been given free rein to take
ordinary, everyday vehicles and make them special, both in
appearance and performance _ but with the emphasis clearly on
performance.
</P>
<P>
   This team has reinvented the Mustang Cobra, the compact Contour
sedan and a handful of other Ford vehicles. But I don't think any
of those compares to the good looks and extraordinary performance
of the Lightning, the true truck lover's truck.
</P>
<P>
   Ford says it doesn't really make money on these
limited-production vehicles, because development costs far outstrip
what the company charges the consumer for the privilege of owning
one. The value to the company, officials say, is the
public-relations boost that these special vehicles give to Ford.
</P>
<P>
   And you will pay dearly for the right to own a Lightning. List
price for our test vehicle was $31,400, including $690
transportation. In comparison, you could buy a base model F-150
with a V-6 engine for not much more than half of that.
</P>
<P>
   But, hey, this is a special vehicle, make no mistake about it.
That base model F-150 will look like a pup if it challenges you to
a (legal) duel.
</P>
<P>
   One look under the hood of the Lightning, and you'll understand
why. It has a supercharged version of Ford's 5.4-liter Triton V-8
engine, rated at a whopping 360 horsepower and 440 foot-pounds of
torque. That's 100 horsepower more than in the regularly aspirated
5.4-liter engine, and way more than the 205 horsepower of the V-6
engine.
</P>
<P>
   The SVT engineers added a forged-steel crankshaft, forged-alloy
connecting rods and forged pistons, and lowered the compression
ratio to 8.4:1 to allow addition of the Roots-type supercharger,
which sits on top of the intake system. That's as technical as I'm
going to get.
</P>
<P>
   This engine is connected to a heavy-duty four-speed automatic
transmission from the Super Duty F-series; no ordinary transmission
would do. There is no manual gearbox offered, though; that would
push performance even higher.
</P>
<P>
   There are some sports cars that can match or slightly exceed the
Lightning's performance, but not any pickups except perhaps that
1991 GMC Syclone, which came with a 4.3-liter turbocharged V-6, and
was just about as quick.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the most practical truck, either, particularly if you
have a family to haul around. To ensure the best handling to go
along with the Lightning's speediness, the SVT engineers decided to
use a regular cab, short-bed, flare-side version of the F-150. You
can get three people in the front seat if you need to, but there is
no extended-cab version to allow you to take the kids along in the
rear seat.
</P>
<P>
   Round driving lights and a special front fascia design are
exclusive to the Lightning, which has the special ``Lightning''
badging on both front fenders in front of the doors.
</P>
<P>
   The interior is rather luxurious for a truck. The seats are
leather-covered, the door panels are leather, and there is a
leather-wrapped steering wheel. The driver's side has electric seat
controls.
</P>
<P>
   Other standard equipment included dual air bags with a
passenger-side cut-off switch; a premium AM/FM stereo with
single-disc in-dash CD player; dual electric remote-control outside
mirrors, four-wheel disc brakes with three-channel anti-lock
system; power windows and door locks; manual air-conditioning,
overhead console with electronic compass and exterior temperature
gauge; cruise control; remote keyless entry; and floor mats.
</P>
<P>
   Standard are eight-inch, five-spoke, cast-aluminum wheels and
special Goodyear Eagle tires _ Z-rated for high-speed operation.
There is a solid rear axle and a 3.55:1 limited-slip rear end; the
rear suspension has five-leaf springs, and there are gas-tuned
shock absorbers all around.
</P>
<P>
   Up front, there are coil springs and a solid stabilizer bar.
Steering is power-assisted recirculating ball type. The only
options offered are a soft cargo-bed cover ($150), towing package
($245) and an AM/FM/cassette stereo with six-disc remote CD changer
that fits behind the passenger seat ($210). Our test vehicle did
not have any of the options, however.
</P>
<P>
   To help ensure that no one steals the vehicle, the Lightning has
Ford's passive anti-theft system, which uses a tiny transponder
built into the ignition key, set to a special security code. It
must correspond to the code stored in the truck's engine computer;
if not, the vehicle won't run.
</P>
<P>
   Braking is awesome, which is a good thing for a vehicle that can
go 140 mph (I didn't try this; I'll take Ford's word for it). Ford
says the Lightning stops from 60 mph in just 137 feet, which is 10
feet more than it takes to stop the much-lighter SVT Mustang Cobra.
</P>
<P>
   EPA fuel-economy ratings are 13 miles per gallon in the city and
17 mpg on the highway. That's better than I thought they would be,
but they are calculated on driving this truck at posted speed
limits and with easy acceleration. Fat chance that's going to
happen.
</P>
<P>
   The tank holds 24.5 gallons of gasoline.

   DRUG-ADDICTION (Undated) _ The debate about whether drug
addiction is a disease: Dr. Alan I. Leshner, the director of the
National Institute on Drug Abuse, says that the brain of an addict
is fundamentally different from that of a nonaddict. Initially,
when a person uses hard drugs like heroin or cocaine, the chemistry
of the brain is not much affected, and the decision to take the
drugs remains voluntary. But at a certain point, he says, a
``metaphorical switch in the brain'' gets thrown, and the
individual moves into a state of addiction characterized by
compulsive drug use. These brain changes, Leshner says, persist
long after addicts stop using drugs, which is why, he continues,
relapse is so common. Addiction, Leshner declares, should be
approached more like other chronic illnesses, such as diabetes and
hypertension. Going further, he says that drugs so alter the brain
that addiction can be compared to mental disorders like Alzheimer's
disease and schizophrenia. It is, he says, a ``brain disease.'' By

where the highest legal speed limit is 75 mph (and just 70 here in
Texas). This truck really needs a place to run, and public highways
just aren't appropriate. I would probably want to make arrangements
with General Manager Eddie Gossage at the Texas Motor Speedway in
Fort Worth to let me take this baby around the track occasionally,
just to blow the carbon out of the cylinders.
</P>
<P>
   As far as that goes, perhaps anyone considering purchasing the
Lightning should arrange for some regular track time at a nearby
speedway, or at least put a good traffic lawyer on retainer.
</P>
<P>
   SVT stands for ``special vehicle team,'' which is a group of
Ford Motor Co. car nuts who have been given free rein to take
ordinary, everyday vehicles and make them special, both in
appearance and performance _ but with the emphasis clearly on
performance.
</P>
<P>
   This team has reinvented the Mustang Cobra, the compact Contour
sedan and a handful of other Ford vehicles. But I don't think any
of those compares to the good looks and extraordinary performance
of the Lightning, the true truck lover's truck.
</P>
<P>
   Ford says it doesn't really make money on these
limited-production vehicles, because development costs far outstrip
what the company charges the consumer for the privilege of owning
one. The value to the company, officials say, is the
public-relations boost that these special vehicles give to Ford.
</P>
<P>
   And you will pay dearly for the right to own a Lightning. List
price for our test vehicle was $31,400, including $690
transportation. In comparison, you could buy a base model F-150
with a V-6 engine for not much more than half of that.
</P>
<P>
   But, hey, this is a special vehicle, make no mistake about it.
That base model F-150 will look like a pup if it challenges you to
a (legal) duel.
</P>
<P>
   One look under the hood of the Lightning, and you'll understand
why. It has a supercharged version of Ford's 5.4-liter Triton V-8
engine, rated at a whopping 360 horsepower and 440 foot-pounds of
torque. That's 100 horsepower more than in the regularly aspirated
5.4-liter engine, and way more than the 205 horsepower of the V-6
engine.
</P>
<P>
   The SVT engineers added a forged-steel crankshaft, forged-alloy
connecting rods and forged pistons, and lowered the compression
ratio to 8.4:1 to allow addition of the Roots-type supercharger,
which sits on top of the intake system. That's as technical as I'm
going to get.
</P>
<P>
   This engine is connected to a heavy-duty four-speed automatic
transmission from the Super Duty F-series; no ordinary transmission
would do. There is no manual gearbox offered, though; that would
push performance even higher.
</P>
<P>
   There are some sports cars that can match or slightly exceed the
Lightning's performance, but not any pickups except perhaps that
1991 GMC Syclone, which came with a 4.3-liter turbocharged V-6, and
was just about as quick.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the most practical truck, either, particularly if you
have a family to haul around. To ensure the best handling to go
along with the Lightning's speediness, the SVT engineers decided to
use a regular cab, short-bed, flare-side version of the F-150. You
can get three people in the front seat if you need to, but there is
no extended-cab version to allow you to take the kids along in the
rear seat.
</P>
<P>
   Round driving lights and a special front fascia design are
exclusive to the Lightning, which has the special ``Lightning''
badging on both front fenders in front of the doors.
</P>
<P>
   The interior is rather luxurious for a truck. The seats are
leather-covered, the door panels are leather, and there is a
leather-wrapped steering wheel. The driver's side has electric seat
controls.
</P>
<P>
   Other standard equipment included dual air bags with a
passenger-side cut-off switch; a premium AM/FM stereo with
single-disc in-dash CD player; dual electric remote-control outside
mirrors, four-wheel disc brakes with three-channel anti-lock
system; power windows and door locks; manual air-conditioning,
overhead console with electronic compass and exterior temperature
gauge; cruise control; remote keyless entry; and floor mats.
</P>
<P>
   Standard are eight-inch, five-spoke, cast-aluminum wheels and
special Goodyear Eagle tires _ Z-rated for high-speed operation.
There is a solid rear axle and a 3.55:1 limited-slip rear end; the
rear suspension has five-leaf springs, and there are gas-tuned
shock absorbers all around.
</P>
<P>
   Up front, there are coil springs and a solid stabilizer bar.
Steering is power-assisted recirculating ball type. The only
options offered are a soft cargo-bed cover ($150), towing package
($245) and an AM/FM/cassette stereo with six-disc remote CD changer
that fits behind the passenger seat ($210). Our test vehicle did
not have any of the options, however.
</P>
<P>
   To help ensure that no one steals the vehicle, the Lightning has
Ford's passive anti-theft system, which uses a tiny transponder
built into the ignition key, set to a special security code. It
must correspond to the code stored in the truck's engine computer;
if not, the vehicle won't run.
</P>
<P>
   Braking is awesome, which is a good thing for a vehicle that can
go 140 mph (I didn't try this; I'll take Ford's word for it). Ford
says the Lightning stops from 60 mph in just 137 feet, which is 10
feet more than it takes to stop the much-lighter SVT Mustang Cobra.
</P>
<P>
   EPA fuel-economy ratings are 13 miles per gallon in the city and
17 mpg on the highway. That's better than I thought they would be,
but they are calculated on driving this truck at posted speed
limits and with easy acceleration. Fat chance that's going to
happen.
</P>
<P>
   The tank holds 24.5 gallons of gasoline.

&HT;     MALE BONDING: GOOD, BAD, SOMETIMES UGLY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By WILLIAM WONG  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PIEDMONT, Calif. _ It may not be obvious, but football star
Steve Young's retirement announcement and the New York Central Park
assaults have something
</P>
<P>
   in common _ male bonding.
</P>
<P>
   The Young event showed male bonding at its sweetest and
gentlest. The New York incident was male bonding at its most vile.
Nonetheless, both high-profile occurrences reminded the world that
men commune with one another in ways that subordinate women.
</P>
<P>
   This affirmation of maleness comes at a wholly ambivalent period
in contemporary male-female relations in the Western world.
Feminist struggles have yielded remarkable gains for women. They
have become well-integrated in the corporate world, as well as in
the public sector.
</P>
<P>
   A few women are chief executives of major companies. Two women
from the San Francisco Bay Area are U.S. senators representing
California. The secretary of State is a woman. First lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton is running for U.S. senator from New York. Several
women are prominent national TV sportscasters, long a men-only job.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, feminist victories have engendered a fierce
male backlash, aided in some cases by compliant women. While the
wage gap has narrowed, men still generally out-earn women for doing
the same kind of work.
</P>
<P>
   Culturally, we are in a Playboy retro period in which feminine
pulchritude is highly valued by the mostly male policy makers in
the entertainment world _ and by countless panting young men.
</P>
<P>
   Sexy lingerie purveyors flaunt their stuff all over commercial
TV, popular periodicals and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Young's long-awaited announcement of his retirement from
the San Francisco 49ers announcement was an unfiltered exhibition
of male bonding. When, in his rambling remarks, he thanked all his
coaches and many teammates and even the team's support staff and
sports journalists, one could almost feel the camaraderie Young had
nurtured throughout his prodigious athletic career.
</P>
<P>
   For mere mortals, there might have been a trace of envy. Here
was a handsome man _ gifted in athletic and intellectual ways _ who
had become a heroic figure, now facing perhaps an even brighter
future _ newly married with a baby on the way and numerous options
in the corporate, legal and sports broadcasting world and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Going through the football wars, as Young has, is one
manifestation of male bonding. Another is going through real wars.
</P>
<P>
   The transition from one millennium to the next has brought us
many retrospectives on the great wars of the 20th century, and we
have seen countless tributes to veterans of those wars. What comes
across strongly is the bonding among the men who survived.
</P>
<P>
   War is the nastiest of collective human endeavors, yet men who
miraculously manage to escape alive retain indelible feelings about
the shared experience. Those who didn't go through the experience
wouldn't understand.
</P>
<P>
   The Central Park assaults are a form of male bonding gone
haywire. A bunch of guys, fueled by beer and other alcoholic and
perhaps narcotic stimulants, express their base animal instincts
when women approach. It's not just a herd of New York schmoes who
behave like wild dogs in heat.
</P>
<P>
   Remember the Tailhook incident of the early 1990s when a
convention of Navy aviators, all liquored up, assaulted women in a
Las Vegas hotel? We also see the potential for this kind of extreme
male bonding at professional sporting events like 49er and Raider
football games. Juiced from too much booze and the excitement of
watching their gridiron heroes smashing into one another, men in
the stands scream their heads off and threaten all sorts of mayhem
on fans wearing the jerseys of the opposing team.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, the players themselves _ whether on the football
field, baseball diamond, hockey rink, or basketball court _ are
transformed into mobs.
</P>
<P>
   Boys just being boys.
</P>
<P>

columnist whose book, ``Yellow Journalist,'' will be published by
Temple University in February 2001.)

&HT;     THE FORD SVT LIGHTNING IS A HOT TRUCK 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ After a few minutes _ no, actually, just a few
seconds _ behind the wheel of the Ford F-150 SVT Lightning pickup,
this week's test drive, I was glad of two things.
</P>
<P>
   One: That it is not often that I get vehicles like this to test
drive, otherwise I would get into trouble.
</P>
<P>
   And two: That there was no traffic cop riding behind me when I
goosed the gas the first time and this vehicle scratched off like,
well, greased lightning.
</P>
<P>
   This is, without a doubt, one of the two hottest trucks I've
ever driven; the other was the 1991GMC Sonoma Syclone.
</P>
<P>
   Ford says the Lightning will go from zero to 60 mph in just 5.4
seconds, and I believe it. I also believe that it probably would
take less than 10 seconds to go from zero to impound, especially if
that traffic cop really is behind the Lightning.
</P>
<P>
   In more than 15 years of testing cars and writing about them,
this is one of the most fun vehicles I've had the pleasure of
driving.
</P>
<P>
   The Lightning probably is the fastest production-model truck in
the world, and I know it is one of the fastest street-legal
vehicles I've ever driven.
</P>
<P>
   If I had kept it much longer than the week I had it, I probably
would have gotten some kind of ticket, as careful as I was. This
truck likes to run, and it really is hard to rein in. With just
light pressure on the accelerator, this baby jumps out and starts
moving like quail coming out of a bush. And without even knowing
it, you're way beyond the speed limit.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure how practical all of that power is in this country,
where the highest legal speed limit is 75 mph (and just 70 here in
Texas). This truck really needs a place to run, and public highways
just aren't appropriate. I would probably want to make arrangements
with General Manager Eddie Gossage at the Texas Motor Speedway in
Fort Worth to let me take this baby around the track occasionally,

go 140 mph (I didn't try this; I'll take Ford's word for it). Ford
says the Lightning stops from 60 mph in just 137 feet, which is 10
feet more than it takes to stop the much-lighter SVT Mustang Cobra.
</P>
<P>
   EPA fuel-economy ratings are 13 miles per gallon in the city and
17 mpg on the highway. That's better than I thought they would be,
but they are calculated on driving this truck at posted speed
limits and with easy acceleration. Fat chance that's going to
happen.

&HT;     THE FORD SVT LIGHTNING IS A HOT TRUCK

<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ After a few minutes _ no, actually, just a few
seconds _ behind the wheel of the Ford F-150 SVT Lightning pickup,
this week's test drive, I was glad of two things.
</P>
<P>
   One: That it is not often that I get vehicles like this to test
drive, otherwise I would get into trouble.
</P>
<P>
   And two: That there was no traffic cop riding behind me when I
goosed the gas the first time and this vehicle scratched off like,
well, greased lightning.
</P>
<P>
   This is, without a doubt, one of the two hottest trucks I've
ever driven; the other was the 1991GMC Sonoma Syclone.
</P>
<P>
   Ford says the Lightning will go from zero to 60 mph in just 5.4
seconds, and I believe it. I also believe that it probably would
take less than 10 seconds to go from zero to impound, especially if
that traffic cop really is behind the Lightning.
</P>
<P>
   In more than 15 years of testing cars and writing about them,
this is one of the most fun vehicles I've had the pleasure of
driving.
</P>
<P>
   The Lightning probably is the fastest production-model truck in
the world, and I know it is one of the fastest street-legal
vehicles I've ever driven.
</P>
<P>
   If I had kept it much longer than the week I had it, I probably
would have gotten some kind of ticket, as careful as I was. This
truck likes to run, and it really is hard to rein in. With just
light pressure on the accelerator, this baby jumps out and starts
moving like quail coming out of a bush. And without even knowing
it, you're way beyond the speed limit.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure how practical all of that power is in this country,
where the highest legal speed limit is 75 mph (and just 70 here in
Texas). This truck really needs a place to run, and public highways
just aren't appropriate. I would probably want to make arrangements
with General Manager Eddie Gossage at the Texas Motor Speedway in
Fort Worth to let me take this baby around the track occasionally,
just to blow the carbon out of the cylinders.
</P>
<P>
   As far as that goes, perhaps anyone considering purchasing the
Lightning should arrange for some regular track time at a nearby
speedway, or at least put a good traffic lawyer on retainer.
</P>
<P>
   SVT stands for ``special vehicle team,'' which is a group of
Ford Motor Co. car nuts who have been given free rein to take
ordinary, everyday vehicles and make them special, both in
appearance and performance _ but with the emphasis clearly on
performance.
</P>
<P>
   This team has reinvented the Mustang Cobra, the compact Contour
sedan and a handful of other Ford vehicles. But I don't think any
of those compares to the good looks and extraordinary performance
of the Lightning, the true truck lover's truck.
</P>
<P>
   Ford says it doesn't really make money on these
limited-production vehicles, because development costs far outstrip
what the company charges the consumer for the privilege of owning
one. The value to the company, officials say, is the
public-relations boost that these special vehicles give to Ford.
</P>
<P>
   And you will pay dearly for the right to own a Lightning. List
price for our test vehicle was $31,400, including $690
transportation. In comparison, you could buy a base model F-150
with a V-6 engine for not much more than half of that.
</P>
<P>
   But, hey, this is a special vehicle, make no mistake about it.
That base model F-150 will look like a pup if it challenges you to
a (legal) duel.
</P>
<P>
   One look under the hood of the Lightning, and you'll understand
why. It has a supercharged version of Ford's 5.4-liter Triton V-8
engine, rated at a whopping 360 horsepower and 440 foot-pounds of
torque. That's 100 horsepower more than in the regularly aspirated
5.4-liter engine, and way more than the 205 horsepower of the V-6
engine.
</P>
<P>
   The SVT engineers added a forged-steel crankshaft, forged-alloy
connecting rods and forged pistons, and lowered the compression
ratio to 8.4:1 to allow addition of the Roots-type supercharger,
which sits on top of the intake system. That's as technical as I'm
going to get.
</P>
<P>
   This engine is connected to a heavy-duty four-speed automatic
transmission from the Super Duty F-series; no ordinary transmission
would do. There is no manual gearbox offered, though; that would
push performance even higher.
</P>
<P>
   There are some sports cars that can match or slightly exceed the
Lightning's performance, but not any pickups except perhaps that
1991 GMC Syclone, which came with a 4.3-liter turbocharged V-6, and
was just about as quick.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the most practical truck, either, particularly if you
have a family to haul around. To ensure the best handling to go
along with the Lightning's speediness, the SVT engineers decided to
use a regular cab, short-bed, flare-side version of the F-150. You
can get three people in the front seat if you need to, but there is
no extended-cab version to allow you to take the kids along in the
rear seat.
</P>
<P>
   Round driving lights and a special front fascia design are
exclusive to the Lightning, which has the special ``Lightning''
badging on both front fenders in front of the doors.
</P>
<P>
   The interior is rather luxurious for a truck. The seats are
leather-covered, the door panels are leather, and there is a
leather-wrapped steering wheel. The driver's side has electric seat
controls.
</P>
<P>
   Other standard equipment included dual air bags with a
passenger-side cut-off switch; a premium AM/FM stereo with
single-disc in-dash CD player; dual electric remote-control outside
mirrors, four-wheel disc brakes with three-channel anti-lock
system; power windows and door locks; manual air-conditioning,
overhead console with electronic compass and exterior temperature
gauge; cruise control; remote keyless entry; and floor mats.
</P>
<P>
   Standard are eight-inch, five-spoke, cast-aluminum wheels and
special Goodyear Eagle tires _ Z-rated for high-speed operation.
There is a solid rear axle and a 3.55:1 limited-slip rear end; the
rear suspension has five-leaf springs, and there are gas-tuned
shock absorbers all around.
</P>
<P>
   Up front, there are coil springs and a solid stabilizer bar.
Steering is power-assisted recirculating ball type. The only
options offered are a soft cargo-bed cover ($150), towing package
($245) and an AM/FM/cassette stereo with six-disc remote CD changer
that fits behind the passenger seat ($210). Our test vehicle did
not have any of the options, however.
</P>
<P>
   To help ensure that no one steals the vehicle, the Lightning has
Ford's passive anti-theft system, which uses a tiny transponder
built into the ignition key, set to a special security code. It
must correspond to the code stored in the truck's engine computer;
if not, the vehicle won't run.
</P>
<P>
   Braking is awesome, which is a good thing for a vehicle that can
go 140 mph (I didn't try this; I'll take Ford's word for it). Ford

<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ After a few minutes _ no, actually, just a few
seconds _ behind the wheel of the Ford F-150 SVT Lightning pickup,
this week's test drive, I was glad of two things.
</P>
<P>
   One: That it is not often that I get vehicles like this to test
drive, otherwise I would get into trouble.
</P>
<P>
   And two: That there was no traffic cop riding behind me when I
goosed the gas the first time and this vehicle scratched off like,
well, greased lightning.
</P>
<P>
   This is, without a doubt, one of the two hottest trucks I've
ever driven; the other was the 1991GMC Sonoma Syclone.
</P>
<P>
   Ford says the Lightning will go from zero to 60 mph in just 5.4
seconds, and I believe it. I also believe that it probably would
take less than 10 seconds to go from zero to impound, especially if
that traffic cop really is behind the Lightning.
</P>
<P>
   In more than 15 years of testing cars and writing about them,
this is one of the most fun vehicles I've had the pleasure of
driving.
</P>
<P>
   The Lightning probably is the fastest production-model truck in
the world, and I know it is one of the fastest street-legal
vehicles I've ever driven.
</P>
<P>
   If I had kept it much longer than the week I had it, I probably
would have gotten some kind of ticket, as careful as I was. This
truck likes to run, and it really is hard to rein in. With just
light pressure on the accelerator, this baby jumps out and starts
moving like quail coming out of a bush. And without even knowing
it, you're way beyond the speed limit.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure how practical all of that power is in this country,
where the highest legal speed limit is 75 mph (and just 70 here in
Texas). This truck really needs a place to run, and public highways
just aren't appropriate. I would probably want to make arrangements
with General Manager Eddie Gossage at the Texas Motor Speedway in
Fort Worth to let me take this baby around the track occasionally,
just to blow the carbon out of the cylinders.
</P>
<P>
   As far as that goes, perhaps anyone considering purchasing the
Lightning should arrange for some regular track time at a nearby
speedway, or at least put a good traffic lawyer on retainer.
</P>
<P>
   SVT stands for ``special vehicle team,'' which is a group of
Ford Motor Co. car nuts who have been given free rein to take
ordinary, everyday vehicles and make them special, both in
appearance and performance _ but with the emphasis clearly on
performance.
</P>
<P>
   This team has reinvented the Mustang Cobra, the compact Contour
sedan and a handful of other Ford vehicles. But I don't think any
of those compares to the good looks and extraordinary performance
of the Lightning, the true truck lover's truck.
</P>
<P>
   Ford says it doesn't really make money on these
limited-production vehicles, because development costs far outstrip
what the company charges the consumer for the privilege of owning
one. The value to the company, officials say, is the
public-relations boost that these special vehicles give to Ford.
</P>
<P>
   And you will pay dearly for the right to own a Lightning. List
price for our test vehicle was $31,400, including $690
transportation. In comparison, you could buy a base model F-150
with a V-6 engine for not much more than half of that.
</P>
<P>
   But, hey, this is a special vehicle, make no mistake about it.
That base model F-150 will look like a pup if it challenges you to
a (legal) duel.
</P>
<P>
   One look under the hood of the Lightning, and you'll understand
why. It has a supercharged version of Ford's 5.4-liter Triton V-8
engine, rated at a whopping 360 horsepower and 440 foot-pounds of
torque. That's 100 horsepower more than in the regularly aspirated
5.4-liter engine, and way more than the 205 horsepower of the V-6
engine.
</P>
<P>
   The SVT engineers added a forged-steel crankshaft, forged-alloy
connecting rods and forged pistons, and lowered the compression
ratio to 8.4:1 to allow addition of the Roots-type supercharger,
which sits on top of the intake system. That's as technical as I'm
going to get.
</P>
<P>
   This engine is connected to a heavy-duty four-speed automatic
transmission from the Super Duty F-series; no ordinary transmission
would do. There is no manual gearbox offered, though; that would
push performance even higher.
</P>
<P>
   There are some sports cars that can match or slightly exceed the
Lightning's performance, but not any pickups except perhaps that
1991 GMC Syclone, which came with a 4.3-liter turbocharged V-6, and
was just about as quick.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the most practical truck, either, particularly if you
have a family to haul around. To ensure the best handling to go
along with the Lightning's speediness, the SVT engineers decided to
use a regular cab, short-bed, flare-side version of the F-150. You
can get three people in the front seat if you need to, but there is
no extended-cab version to allow you to take the kids along in the
rear seat.
</P>
<P>
   Round driving lights and a special front fascia design are
exclusive to the Lightning, which has the special ``Lightning''
badging on both front fenders in front of the doors.
</P>
<P>
   The interior is rather luxurious for a truck. The seats are
leather-covered, the door panels are leather, and there is a
leather-wrapped steering wheel. The driver's side has electric seat
controls.
</P>
<P>
   Other standard equipment included dual air bags with a
passenger-side cut-off switch; a premium AM/FM stereo with
single-disc in-dash CD player; dual electric remote-control outside
mirrors, four-wheel disc brakes with three-channel anti-lock
system; power windows and door locks; manual air-conditioning,
overhead console with electronic compass and exterior temperature
gauge; cruise control; remote keyless entry; and floor mats.
</P>
<P>
   Standard are eight-inch, five-spoke, cast-aluminum wheels and
special Goodyear Eagle tires _ Z-rated for high-speed operation.
There is a solid rear axle and a 3.55:1 limited-slip rear end; the
rear suspension has five-leaf springs, and there are gas-tuned
shock absorbers all around.
</P>
<P>
   Up front, there are coil springs and a solid stabilizer bar.
Steering is power-assisted recirculating ball type. The only
options offered are a soft cargo-bed cover ($150), towing package
($245) and an AM/FM/cassette stereo with six-disc remote CD changer
that fits behind the passenger seat ($210). Our test vehicle did
not have any of the options, however.
</P>
<P>
   To help ensure that no one steals the vehicle, the Lightning has
Ford's passive anti-theft system, which uses a tiny transponder
built into the ignition key, set to a special security code. It
must correspond to the code stored in the truck's engine computer;
if not, the vehicle won't run.
</P>
<P>
   Braking is awesome, which is a good thing for a vehicle that can
go 140 mph (I didn't try this; I'll take Ford's word for it). Ford
says the Lightning stops from 60 mph in just 137 feet, which is 10
feet more than it takes to stop the much-lighter SVT Mustang Cobra.
</P>
<P>
   EPA fuel-economy ratings are 13 miles per gallon in the city and
17 mpg on the highway. That's better than I thought they would be,
but they are calculated on driving this truck at posted speed
limits and with easy acceleration. Fat chance that's going to
happen.
</P>
<P>
   The tank holds 24.5 gallons of gasoline.

ever driven; the other was the 1991GMC Sonoma Syclone.
</P>
<P>
   Ford says the Lightning will go from zero to 60 mph in just 5.4
seconds, and I believe it. I also believe that it probably would
take less than 10 seconds to go from zero to impound, especially if
that traffic cop really is behind the Lightning.
</P>
<P>
   In more than 15 years of testing cars and writing about them,
this is one of the most fun vehicles I've had the pleasure of
driving.
</P>
<P>
   The Lightning probably is the fastest production-model truck in
the world, and I know it is one of the fastest street-legal
vehicles I've ever driven.
</P>
<P>
   If I had kept it much longer than the week I had it, I probably
would have gotten some kind of ticket, as careful as I was. This
truck likes to run, and it really is hard to rein in. With just
light pressure on the accelerator, this baby jumps out and starts
moving like quail coming out of a bush. And without even knowing
it, you're way beyond the speed limit.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure how practical all of that power is in this country,
where the highest legal speed limit is 75 mph (and just 70 here in
Texas). This truck really needs a place to run, and public highways
just aren't appropriate. I would probably want to make arrangements
with General Manager Eddie Gossage at the Texas Motor Speedway in
Fort Worth to let me take this baby around the track occasionally,
just to blow the carbon out of the cylinders.
</P>
<P>
   As far as that goes, perhaps anyone considering purchasing the
Lightning should arrange for some regular track time at a nearby
speedway, or at least put a good traffic lawyer on retainer.
</P>
<P>
   SVT stands for ``special vehicle team,'' which is a group of
Ford Motor Co. car nuts who have been given free rein to take
ordinary, everyday vehicles and make them special, both in
appearance and performance _ but with the emphasis clearly on
performance.
</P>
<P>
   This team has reinvented the Mustang Cobra, the compact Contour
sedan and a handful of other Ford vehicles. But I don't think any
of those compares to the good looks and extraordinary performance
of the Lightning, the true truck lover's truck.
</P>
<P>
   Ford says it doesn't really make money on these
limited-production vehicles, because development costs far outstrip
what the company charges the consumer for the privilege of owning
one. The value to the company, officials say, is the
public-relations boost that these special vehicles give to Ford.
</P>
<P>
   And you will pay dearly for the right to own a Lightning. List
price for our test vehicle was $31,400, including $690
transportation. In comparison, you could buy a base model F-150
with a V-6 engine for not much more than half of that.
</P>
<P>
   But, hey, this is a special vehicle, make no mistake about it.
That base model F-150 will look like a pup if it challenges you to
a (legal) duel.
</P>
<P>
   One look under the hood of the Lightning, and you'll understand
why. It has a supercharged version of Ford's 5.4-liter Triton V-8
engine, rated at a whopping 360 horsepower and 440 foot-pounds of
torque. That's 100 horsepower more than in the regularly aspirated
5.4-liter engine, and way more than the 205 horsepower of the V-6
engine.
</P>
<P>
   The SVT engineers added a forged-steel crankshaft, forged-alloy
connecting rods and forged pistons, and lowered the compression
ratio to 8.4:1 to allow addition of the Roots-type supercharger,
which sits on top of the intake system. That's as technical as I'm
going to get.
</P>
<P>
   This engine is connected to a heavy-duty four-speed automatic
transmission from the Super Duty F-series; no ordinary transmission
would do. There is no manual gearbox offered, though; that would
push performance even higher.
</P>
<P>
   There are some sports cars that can match or slightly exceed the
Lightning's performance, but not any pickups except perhaps that
1991 GMC Syclone, which came with a 4.3-liter turbocharged V-6, and
was just about as quick.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the most practical truck, either, particularly if you
have a family to haul around. To ensure the best handling to go
along with the Lightning's speediness, the SVT engineers decided to
use a regular cab, short-bed, flare-side version of the F-150. You
can get three people in the front seat if you need to, but there is
no extended-cab version to allow you to take the kids along in the
rear seat.
</P>
<P>
   Round driving lights and a special front fascia design are
exclusive to the Lightning, which has the special ``Lightning''
badging on both front fenders in front of the doors.
</P>
<P>
   The interior is rather luxurious for a truck. The seats are
leather-covered, the door panels are leather, and there is a
leather-wrapped steering wheel. The driver's side has electric seat
controls.
</P>
<P>
   Other standard equipment included dual air bags with a
passenger-side cut-off switch; a premium AM/FM stereo with
single-disc in-dash CD player; dual electric remote-control outside
mirrors, four-wheel disc brakes with three-channel anti-lock
system; power windows and door locks; manual air-conditioning,
overhead console with electronic compass and exterior temperature
gauge; cruise control; remote keyless entry; and floor mats.
</P>
<P>
   Standard are eight-inch, five-spoke, cast-aluminum wheels and
special Goodyear Eagle tires _ Z-rated for high-speed operation.
There is a solid rear axle and a 3.55:1 limited-slip rear end; the
rear suspension has five-leaf springs, and there are gas-tuned
shock absorbers all around.
</P>
<P>
   Up front, there are coil springs and a solid stabilizer bar.
Steering is power-assisted recirculating ball type. The only
options offered are a soft cargo-bed cover ($150), towing package
($245) and an AM/FM/cassette stereo with six-disc remote CD changer
that fits behind the passenger seat ($210). Our test vehicle did
not have any of the options, however.
</P>
<P>
   To help ensure that no one steals the vehicle, the Lightning has
Ford's passive anti-theft system, which uses a tiny transponder
built into the ignition key, set to a special security code. It
must correspond to the code stored in the truck's engine computer;
if not, the vehicle won't run.
</P>
<P>
   Braking is awesome, which is a good thing for a vehicle that can
go 140 mph (I didn't try this; I'll take Ford's word for it). Ford
says the Lightning stops from 60 mph in just 137 feet, which is 10
feet more than it takes to stop the much-lighter SVT Mustang Cobra.
</P>
<P>
   EPA fuel-economy ratings are 13 miles per gallon in the city and
17 mpg on the highway. That's better than I thought they would be,
but they are calculated on driving this truck at posted speed
limits and with easy acceleration. Fat chance that's going to
happen.
</P>
<P>
   The tank holds 24.5 gallons of gasoline.

&HT;     ENGLISH LANGUAGE CD A NATURAL FOR SALSA SINGER MARC ANTHONY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By RAMIRO BURR  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ While the Latino music explosion has been much
talked about, salsa/pop singer Marc Anthony says that his
English-language, self-titled pop CD was not a radical step for
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``That album just represents another side of me; it's another
way of expressing myself,'' he said. ``It is different than my last
three albums (salsa) in that, except for the last song, `Da La
Vuelta,' it is not a Latin music album _ it is a pop album.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up listening to Gloria Gaynor, Air Supply and Barry
Manilow as much as I listened to Hector Lavoe, Tito Puente, et
cetera. Some of the songs were inspired by personal experiences;
others came out of my imagination. This album made me realize that
I could write songs again as I hadn't written in almost 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony is on his North American tour that will see 19 more
dates, including a Sunday show in San Antonio, before wrapping up
July 28 in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   He said his album, which has landed the singles ``I Need to
Know'' and ``You Sang to Me'' on the pop charts, was a challenge
but not new territory. ``Muy Dentro De Mi,'' a Spanish version of
``You Sang To Me,'' was released later as a single and landed on
the Latino charts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everything that's out there is unique. I didn't set
out to do anything different or unique or that appealed to
people,'' he said. ``I just set out to put out the best possible
album I could make, something I could be proud of.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I took a risk, it was in writing my own material, because
when I started making the album I felt, `There are people out there
that write much better than I could.' But I took a stab at it and
after writing my first two songs (the two singles), it gave me the
confidence I needed to keep at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony is the only Latino singer who has sold out Madison
Square Garden twice, starred in a Broadway musical (Paul Simon's
``The Capeman'') and appeared in several movies, including Martin
Scorsese's ``Bringing Out the Dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Spanish Harlem, Anthony was given the name Marco Antonio
Muniz, by his father, Felipe, a musician who greatly admired the
famous Mexican singer. But Anthony changed his name to avoid
confusion with the older man.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony started out singing house music in New York City dance
clubs and later joined up with the Latin Rascals, who worked with
producer Little Louie Vega.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Anthony scored with the single ``Rebel.'' The following
year, Vega and Anthony opened for Puente in Madison Square Garden;
later that year, Anthony recorded his breakthrough single, ``Hasta
que Te Conoci,'' the old classic by Juan Gabriel. Suddenly, the
snowball started rolling fast.
</P>
<P>
   His musical influences are varied.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a child, I was influenced by everything from my father's
boleros and ballads that he would sing with his friends at our
home, salsa music my mother listened to, the disco music of Donna
Summer and Gloria Gaynor my siblings listened to, as well as the
Eagles, Air Supply, Steve Perry, you name it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started singing dance/free-style music. It was Tito Puente
and his belief in me that inspired me to sing salsa and it
completely changed my life.''
</P>
<P>
   His family was also ambivalent about his career choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family always knew I was capable and always believed in me,
but at 19 my mom told me to join the Air Force because music wasn't
paying the bills. I actually went through all the motions, got my
physical, enlisted, etc. and two weeks before I was to leave for
the Air Force I got my recording contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``So luck has a lot to do with it. But had I gone to the Air
Force I might have been a general or something by now. I would have
still put everything into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Was there a moment in his life when he felt singing would be his
career?
</P>
<P>
   ``I still haven't made that decision. Come to think of it, I
never decided I was going to sing; I just always did. I don't
remember a day when music wasn't a part of my life. I always knew
it would be my life whether behind the scenes or as an artist.''
</P>
<P>
   By the way, he hates classifications.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't even begin to describe myself. I really don't like all
of the classifications. I am a pop singer and a salsa singer. My
salsa albums belong in the salsa section. My pop albums in the pop
section of the record store.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you come to one of my concerts you get both sides of me,
the pop and the salsa, and I play with two bands because they are
entirely different genres that tap into completely different
sensitivities.''
</P>
<P>
   And what does music do for him?
</P>
<P>
   ``The ultimate purpose of music, of what I do, is to tell a
story, to make people feel something, to interpret. I do something
you cannot see. I move airwaves, so that people can feel,
understand a story. My father taught me when I was a child that
that's what singing is all about.''

&HT;     THE FORD SVT LIGHTNING IS A HOT TRUCK

<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ After a few minutes _ no, actually, just a few
seconds _ behind the wheel of the Ford F-150 SVT Lightning pickup,
this week's test drive, I was glad of two things.
</P>
<P>
   One: That it is not often that I get vehicles like this to test
drive, otherwise I would get into trouble.
</P>
<P>
   And two: That there was no traffic cop riding behind me when I
goosed the gas the first time and this vehicle scratched off like,
well, greased lightning.
</P>
<P>
   This is, without a doubt, one of the two hottest trucks I've
ever driven; the other was the 1991GMC Sonoma Syclone.
</P>
<P>
   Ford says the Lightning will go from zero to 60 mph in just 5.4
seconds, and I believe it. I also believe that it probably would
take less than 10 seconds to go from zero to impound, especially if
that traffic cop really is behind the Lightning.

   I'm not sure how practical all of that power is in this country,
where the highest legal speed limit is 75 mph (and just 70 here in

   This engine is connected to a heavy-duty four-speed automatic
transmission from the Super Duty F-series; no ordinary transmission
would do. There is no manual gearbox offered, though; that would
push performance even higher.
</P>
<P>
   There are some sports cars that can match or slightly exceed the
Lightning's performance, but not any pickups except perhaps that
1991 GMC Syclone, which came with a 4.3-liter turbocharged V-6, and
was just about as quick.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the most practical truck, either, particularly if you
have a family to haul around. To ensure the best handling to go
along with the Lightning's speediness, the SVT engineers decided to
use a regular cab, short-bed, flare-side version of the F-150. You
can get three people in the front seat if you need to, but there is
no extended-cab version to allow you to take the kids along in the
rear seat.
</P>
<P>
   Round driving lights and a special front fascia design are
exclusive to the Lightning, which has the special ``Lightning''
badging on both front fenders in front of the doors.
</P>
<P>
   The interior is rather luxurious for a truck. The seats are
leather-covered, the door panels are leather, and there is a
leather-wrapped steering wheel. The driver's side has electric seat
controls.
</P>
<P>
   Other standard equipment included dual air bags with a
passenger-side cut-off switch; a premium AM/FM stereo with
single-disc in-dash CD player; dual electric remote-control outside
mirrors, four-wheel disc brakes with three-channel anti-lock
system; power windows and door locks; manual air-conditioning,
overhead console with electronic compass and exterior temperature
gauge; cruise control; remote keyless entry; and floor mats.
</P>
<P>
   Standard are eight-inch, five-spoke, cast-aluminum wheels and
special Goodyear Eagle tires _ Z-rated for high-speed operation.
There is a solid rear axle and a 3.55:1 limited-slip rear end; the
rear suspension has five-leaf springs, and there are gas-tuned
shock absorbers all around.
</P>
<P>
   Up front, there are coil springs and a solid stabilizer bar.
Steering is power-assisted recirculating ball type. The only
options offered are a soft cargo-bed cover ($150), towing package
($245) and an AM/FM/cassette stereo with six-disc remote CD changer
that fits behind the passenger seat ($210). Our test vehicle did
not have any of the options, however.
</P>
<P>
   To help ensure that no one steals the vehicle, the Lightning has
Ford's passive anti-theft system, which uses a tiny transponder
built into the ignition key, set to a special security code. It
must correspond to the code stored in the truck's engine computer;
if not, the vehicle won't run.
</P>
<P>
   Braking is awesome, which is a good thing for a vehicle that can
go 140 mph (I didn't try this; I'll take Ford's word for it). Ford
says the Lightning stops from 60 mph in just 137 feet, which is 10
feet more than it takes to stop the much-lighter SVT Mustang Cobra.
</P>
<P>
   EPA fuel-economy ratings are 13 miles per gallon in the city and
17 mpg on the highway. That's better than I thought they would be,
but they are calculated on driving this truck at posted speed
limits and with easy acceleration. Fat chance that's going to
happen.
</P>
<P>
   The tank holds 24.5 gallons of gasoline.

&HT;     THE FORD SVT LIGHTNING IS A HOT TRUCK

<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ After a few minutes _ no, actually, just a few
seconds _ behind the wheel of the Ford F-150 SVT Lightning pickup,
this week's test drive, I was glad of two things.
</P>
<P>
   One: That it is not often that I get vehicles like this to test
drive, otherwise I would get into trouble.
</P>
<P>
   And two: That there was no traffic cop riding behind me when I
goosed the gas the first time and this vehicle scratched off like,
well, greased lightning.
</P>
<P>
   This is, without a doubt, one of the two hottest trucks I've
ever driven; the other was the 1991GMC Sonoma Syclone.
</P>
<P>
   Ford says the Lightning will go from zero to 60 mph in just 5.4
seconds, and I believe it. I also believe that it probably would
take less than 10 seconds to go from zero to impound, especially if
that traffic cop really is behind the Lightning.
</P>
<P>
   In more than 15 years of testing cars and writing about them,
this is one of the most fun vehicles I've had the pleasure of
driving.
</P>
<P>
   The Lightning probably is the fastest production-model truck in
the world, and I know it is one of the fastest street-legal
vehicles I've ever driven.
</P>
<P>
   If I had kept it much longer than the week I had it, I probably
would have gotten some kind of ticket, as careful as I was. This
truck likes to run, and it really is hard to rein in. With just
light pressure on the accelerator, this baby jumps out and starts
moving like quail coming out of a bush. And without even knowing
it, you're way beyond the speed limit.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure how practical all of that power is in this country,
where the highest legal speed limit is 75 mph (and just 70 here in
Texas). This truck really needs a place to run, and public highways
just aren't appropriate. I would probably want to make arrangements
with General Manager Eddie Gossage at the Texas Motor Speedway in
Fort Worth to let me take this baby around the track occasionally,
just to blow the carbon out of the cylinders.
</P>
<P>
   As far as that goes, perhaps anyone considering purchasing the
Lightning should arrange for some regular track time at a nearby
speedway, or at least put a good traffic lawyer on retainer.
</P>
<P>
   SVT stands for ``special vehicle team,'' which is a group of
Ford Motor Co. car nuts who have been given free rein to take
ordinary, everyday vehicles and make them special, both in
appearance and performance _ but with the emphasis clearly on
performance.
</P>
<P>
   This team has reinvented the Mustang Cobra, the compact Contour
sedan and a handful of other Ford vehicles. But I don't think any
of those compares to the good looks and extraordinary performance
of the Lightning, the true truck lover's truck.
</P>
<P>
   Ford says it doesn't really make money on these
limited-production vehicles, because development costs far outstrip
what the company charges the consumer for the privilege of owning
one. The value to the company, officials say, is the
public-relations boost that these special vehicles give to Ford.
</P>
<P>
   And you will pay dearly for the right to own a Lightning. List
price for our test vehicle was $31,400, including $690
transportation. In comparison, you could buy a base model F-150
with a V-6 engine for not much more than half of that.
</P>
<P>
   But, hey, this is a special vehicle, make no mistake about it.
That base model F-150 will look like a pup if it challenges you to
a (legal) duel.
</P>
<P>
   One look under the hood of the Lightning, and you'll understand
why. It has a supercharged version of Ford's 5.4-liter Triton V-8
engine, rated at a whopping 360 horsepower and 440 foot-pounds of
torque. That's 100 horsepower more than in the regularly aspirated
5.4-liter engine, and way more than the 205 horsepower of the V-6
engine.
</P>
<P>
   The SVT engineers added a forged-steel crankshaft, forged-alloy
connecting rods and forged pistons, and lowered the compression
ratio to 8.4:1 to allow addition of the Roots-type supercharger,
which sits on top of the intake system. That's as technical as I'm
going to get.
</P>
<P>
   This engine is connected to a heavy-duty four-speed automatic
transmission from the Super Duty F-series; no ordinary transmission
would do. There is no manual gearbox offered, though; that would
push performance even higher.

   Other standard equipment included dual air bags with a
passenger-side cut-off switch; a premium AM/FM stereo with
single-disc in-dash CD player; dual electric remote-control outside
mirrors, four-wheel disc brakes with three-channel anti-lock
system; power windows and door locks; manual air-conditioning,
overhead console with electronic compass and exterior temperature
gauge; cruise control; remote keyless entry; and floor mats.
</P>
<P>
   Standard are eight-inch, five-spoke, cast-aluminum wheels and
special Goodyear Eagle tires _ Z-rated for high-speed operation.
There is a solid rear axle and a 3.55:1 limited-slip rear end; the
rear suspension has five-leaf springs, and there are gas-tuned
shock absorbers all around.
</P>
<P>
   Up front, there are coil springs and a solid stabilizer bar.
Steering is power-assisted recirculating ball type. The only
options offered are a soft cargo-bed cover ($150), towing package
($245) and an AM/FM/cassette stereo with six-disc remote CD changer
that fits behind the passenger seat ($210). Our test vehicle did
not have any of the options, however.
</P>
<P>
   To help ensure that no one steals the vehicle, the Lightning has
Ford's passive anti-theft system, which uses a tiny transponder
built into the ignition key, set to a special security code. It
must correspond to the code stored in the truck's engine computer;
if not, the vehicle won't run.
</P>
<P>
   Braking is awesome, which is a good thing for a vehicle that can
go 140 mph (I didn't try this; I'll take Ford's word for it). Ford
says the Lightning stops from 60 mph in just 137 feet, which is 10
feet more than it takes to stop the much-lighter SVT Mustang Cobra.
</P>
<P>
   EPA fuel-economy ratings are 13 miles per gallon in the city and
17 mpg on the highway. That's better than I thought they would be,
but they are calculated on driving this truck at posted speed
limits and with easy acceleration. Fat chance that's going to
happen.
</P>
<P>
   The tank holds 24.5 gallons of gasoline.

&HT;     POLITICAL ANALYSTS SAY BUSH ISN'T HURT BY SUPPORTING DEATH
PENALTY 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Knocked by death penalty protesters while on the
presidential campaign trail, Texas Gov. George W. Bush isn't likely
to lose votes because of his support of the death penalty,
political analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a burning issue. It's momentarily an issue because
the media doesn't have anything else to talk about,'' said Mark
Petracca, chairman of the political science department at the
University of California at Irvine.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking from a state where Bush is fighting hard against
Democratic Vice President Al Gore, Petracca predicted the Gary
Graham story would disappear from newspapers' front pages with
``the first airplane tragedy of the summer or boating tragedy or
celebrity killed or celebrity divorced.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush has got the standard right line here, which is, `I'm
following the law,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Graham was executed in Hunstville, Texas, Thursday night amid a
clamor of protests that he was innocent of the 1981 murder he was
convicted of committing in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Political experts predicted little or no backlash for Bush as
long as he appears to be handling the issue consistently and
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politically, it's a wash,'' said Bruce Buchanan, a political
scientist at the University of Texas at Austin. ``I don't see it
doing him any great harm or any particular good, although it could
reinforce his image for decisively standing firm under pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush will face 14 more executions in the state before Election
Day.
</P>
<P>
   The death penalty won't be a factor with ``the overwhelming
majority of Americans who are in favor of capital punishment,''
said Matthew Felling of the Washington-based Center for Media and
Public Affairs, which does content analyses of news and
entertainment media.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also is a death-penalty supporter, Felling noted.
</P>
<P>
   The worst damage done to Bush over the death penalty came after
he was reported to have spoken in a mocking way about murderer and
born-again Christian Karla Faye Tucker's plea to live, Felling and
others said.
</P>
<P>
   A Bush spokeswoman has said Bush's demeanor was misinterpreted
and that he took the Tucker case seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he really understands now he cannot appear to be
taking that issue lightly,'' said Allan Saxe, a political scientist
at the University of Texas at Arlington. ``The issue of leadership
and seriousness is very important.''
</P>
<P>
   Questions have been raised nationally about the general quality
of legal representation at trial for Texans given the death
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   A number of Texas officials, including Attorney General John
Cornyn, have defended the state's process as fair.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the state's Democratic U.S. representatives have urged
Bush to place a moratorium on executions until a study can be done
of capital punishment here.
</P>
<P>
   The governor of Illinois has done so in his state.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's office said he doesn't have the authority to
independently change death sentences or stop executions.
</P>
<P>
   He only can grant a one-time, 30-day reprieve unless his
appointed Board of Pardons and Paroles recommends otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Bush recently did this for the first time in a case involving
DNA testing.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest case to draw high-profile attention, that of
Graham, who was defended by such well-known figures as the Rev.
Jesse Jackson, officials said Bush couldn't even grant a reprieve
without board action.
</P>
<P>
   That's because former Gov. Ann Richards previously had granted
Graham an independent reprieve.
</P>
<P>
   ``This does highlight the weakness of the gubernatorial office
in Texas,'' said Dennis Goldford, chairman of the department of
politics and international relations at Drake University in Des
Moines.
</P>
<P>
   ``For all that Bush talks about leadership, the governor's
office in Texas, relative to that in other states, is fairly
weak,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Goldford said at worst the Texas death penalty issue at this
point is only ``slightly negative'' for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``It puts him on the defensive a little bit,'' he said. ``Bush
has been setting the agenda of the campaign so far, and Gore has
been responding to Bush. This doesn't knock Bush off stride. It
slows down his offense.''

&HT;     AARDMAN LAYS A GOLDEN EGG WITH `CHICKEN RUN' 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Speaking frankly, here, the chickens in ``Chicken Run'' don't
look all that chickeny. Their beaks are rubbery. Their cans are
bell-shaped. They have teeth. And they're accessorized _ scarves,
pearls, Coke-bottle glasses, cute little beanies. One of them wears
powder-blue bangs and knits.
</P>
<P>
   At night, while the nefarious chicken farmer and his
even-more-nefarious chicken-farming wife are otherwise engaged,
hens as intrepid as the POWs in ``Stalag 17'' hatch not babies but
elaborately mapped-out escape plans involving underground tunnels
and egg beaters. Ginger, the plucky (plucked?) heroine of the
farmyard, constantly runs afoul (afowl?) of her owners and has to
cool her wide bum in solitary, otherwise known as the coal bin. In
moments of panic the girls throw their wings over their heads and
scream, in distinctly unavian tones, ``AHHHHHHHHHHH!''
</P>
<P>
   No one who has seen the clay-animated Wallace and Gromit shorts
would be surprised to learn that the architect of all this
noodle-headed brilliance is Nick Park, he who cast a criminal
penguin in ``The Wrong Trousers'' and cooked up a demonic
sheep-shearing machine for ``A Close Shave'' (whose luddite
sentiments prefigure ``Chicken Run's''). Park's short films are a
joy to watch, for grown-ups and kids alike.
</P>
<P>
   So it is with ``Chicken Run'', Aardman Animations' first feature
film, an utterly charming, utterly good-natured spoof of
prison-breakout movies that mixes fine-feathered swashbuckling with
sweetly dippy humor. Nick Park fans should enjoy themselves. So
should everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   The film's putative star is Mel Gibson, who lends his voice to a
swaggering (cocky?) rooster-character who wows the ladies midway
through. He is, more accurately, the lone American accent in a cast
of quirked-out U.K. voices that includes Jane Horrocks (as Babs, an
especially flaky hen), Timothy Spall (as Mr. Tweedy, the farmer),
Miranda Richardson (as Mrs. Tweedy) and Benjamin Whitrow (as a
snuffling old rooster who flew with the RAF). Some of the humor is
inevitably British and may flap over the heads of wee Americans. It
doesn't matter: What matters is the chance to watch broilers and
fryers boogying under a disco ball. Goofiness is universal.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Aardman shorts, ``Chicken Run'' draws comic derring-do
against a stark backdrop of good vs. evil. The poor, imprisoned
hens, living in barracks, forced to lay eggs or die, line up for
farmyard ``roll calls'' in which despotic Mrs. Tweedy inspects the
lines in tall black boots and a dress that fans in the back like a
stiff Nazi overcoat. The hen that lays the fewest eggs gets the
axe. Grim days, indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Ginger has a hard time getting her fellow chickies
motivated for yet another escape attempt. ``So, layin' eggs all yer
life, then gettin' plucked, stuffed and roasted is good enough for
you, is it?'' she implores in her pipsqueak English accent
(actually Julia Sawalha's). Peeps a compatriot: ``It's a livin'!''
</P>
<P>
   Into this hardscrabble existence drops Rocky ``The Flying
Rooster'' (Gibson), an AWOL circus performer _ a Rhode Island Red,
so he's a Yank _ whom everyone assumes can fly. The girls agree to
hide Rocky for a while in exchange for flying lessons. This he
does, leading them in farmyard calisthenics and devising
suspender-driven catapults that yield disastrous results. Their
efforts turn desperate when thundering trucks arrive from the
ominous Poultry Products Inc. (``Turn your chicken farm into a GOLD
MINE,'' the catalog boasts), the ramifications of which make Oven
Stuffer Roasters look like sunny optimists by comparison.
</P>
<P>
   And so on and so forth, to delightfully muddled effect. Suffice
it to say that the hens' lives are placed in mortal peril, which
drew terrified squirms from my two children but never became too
intense to watch. The kids loved ``Chicken Run'': high on giggles,
low on confusion, rich with characters they could recognize and
care about.
</P>
<P>
   What violence there is amounts to chicken wrangling
(poultry-on-poultry; poultry-on-human) and a brief fisticuffs
sequence that morphs into a mudfight. There's nothing that tests
the ``G'' rating. And there's nothing that tests the patience of
adults, who should walk away from ``Chicken Run'' with a squawk of
approval and a lopsided grin on their beaks.

(For release Sunday, June 25) 
 By GUY TREBAY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ You are standing with your pants around your ankles
when a stranger pulls back a curtain and says, ``Peekaboo!'' You
have been locked out in a public place wearing a single black sock
and a cocktail dress with a price tag hanging off the side. You are
standing in your underwear when the woman your ex dumped you for
strides imperiously into the room.
</P>
<P>
   Pop quiz: Are you 1) trapped in a Freudian nightmare, 2) a
candidate for a case study in ``The Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders'' or 3) out shopping.
</P>
<P>
   The answer, obviously, is 3. And the source of your deep-rooted
anxiety is that perennial bane of the shopper, the dressing room.
Strange real estate, and even weirder psychic landscape, the
dressing room is part dream chamber, part orgone box and a retail
no man's land. Often cramped, creepy and hard to locate, it is
sometimes locked tighter than an ICBM installation and sometimes so
public it could be the stage set for an ``Oh! Calcutta!'' revival.
</P>
<P>
   There are certain enduring mysteries that attach to the dressing
room, like why there is always a fossilized Cheez Doodle in a
corner, why there are never enough places to hang your clothes,
what the mystery stain is on the seat of the solitary chair
(assuming there is a chair) and how come the lighting seems
designed for the application of F/X makeup. Let's leave the fun
house mirrors aside.
</P>
<P>
   The dressing room is a site of particular interest just now, a
time of year that may look and feel like summer but that in fact is
an entirely different point in the retail calendar. For serious
shoppers, late June is not the season of fireflies and view tables
at Della Femina in East Hampton. By the time of the summer
solstice, anyone of serious shopping purpose has posted his jitney
ticket on eBay and pitched a tent in Barneys. Markdowns are in full
force, spring and summer apparel being treated by retailers with
all the affectionate hindsight of a drunken one-night stand.
(Thirty percent off at Prada, 50 at Ermenegildo Zegna, 70 percent
at Amy Chan.) The alluring first fall shipments have begun to
arrive. Veterans know that all the great back-to-school clothes
will be sold out long before the first maple reddens. Summer is the
new winter, as they say.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why you might think retailers would recognize the
importance of dressing rooms. ``Dressing rooms are where the rubber
meets the road,'' Paco Underhill, a marketing consultant, said.
``The dressing room is critical to the conversion rate. A lot of
decisions are made there.'' ``Conversion rate'' is marketing jargon
for that alchemical moment when a shopper becomes a buyer.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers agree that the transformation takes place inside a
dressing room. What's odd, though, is that this consensus is rarely
reflected in the rooms themselves, which in Manhattan represent a
true rarity _ real estate nobody seems to want. ``The dressing room
is a very important part of forming the customer connection,'' said
Underhill, the author of ``Why We Buy: The Science of Shopping''
(Simon &AMP; Schuster). ``It reflects the store's ethos. Yet, they're
inconveniently located, no one wants to clean them, the lights are
god awful. It's almost as if the space belonged to no one.''
</P>
<P>
   A meandering tour, ranging from the scruffy chic of NoLIta's
hole-in-the-wall fashion outposts, to the sanitarium hush of upper
Madison Avenue boutiques, revealed that Underhill's diagnosis was
apposite. At Mayle, a Mulberry Street favorite of fashionistas,
customers dress in a tiny closet behind a scrap of fabric. At the
Union Square discounter Bradlees _ whose sprayed concrete ceilings
and sepulchral dim evoke the Soviet-era department store GUM _ the
dressing rooms resemble shower stalls and can be entered only after
garment pockets are checked for ``like, stolen bobby pins or other
small stuff,'' a saleswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Banana Republic in SoHo, the pleasure of capacious, well
appointed dressing rooms is offset somewhat by self-locking doors
that overplay corporate paranoia about theft. (Salesman to
customer: ``You all right in there?'' Customer to salesman: ``Oh,
just fine. Be out as soon as I finish concealing these khakis in a
body cavity.'')
</P>
<P>
   At Loehmann's on lower Seventh Avenue, customers continue to
dress in an infamous communal space. It's the way they prefer it,
Fred Forcellati, a vice president, said. ``If someone's got a dress
you want, you can say, `Oh, that doesn't look great on you,' and
then the minute they put it down, you grab,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   And at Jeffrey, the relentlessly fashion-forward store in the
meat-packing district, where shoes are displayed with the devotion
of reliquary fragments, customers change in an area whose general
lack of amenity and privacy bring to mind a visit to the school
nurse.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a perfect world scenario,'' said Jeffrey Kalinsky, the
store's owner, ``a dressing room would have a mirror, some place to
sit down _ and a carpet,'' because sweaty bare feet track dirt. It
would also have ample hanging bars, even bathrobes and individual
makeup masks, which are provided at the original Jeffrey in
Atlanta. The reality is slightly less heady. ``Who wants to try on
a $3,000 dress behind a shower curtain?'' Barbara Heizer, a
customer, said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   The same people, presumably, who skulk behind the drapery at APC
in SoHo, slithering into $300 cigarette jeans in a semipublic area
where there is no place to set the clothes you just shed. Or the
ones trying on $1,800 Hedi Slimane suits at Yves St. Laurent Hommes
on Greene Street, where customers dress in a velvet-curtained
cubicle with the feel of a coffin that won't stay shut. (It was
there that a ``Peekaboo!'' interloper recently surprised me with my
Nicole Farhi trousers puddled at my feet.)
</P>
<P>
   ``In the old days, fitting rooms were big and lush,'' said Betty
Halbreich, author of ``Confessions of a Retail Therapist''
(HarperCollins) and a personal shopper at Bergdorf Goodman for 23
years. ``They had bud vases and flowers. Now, they don't even
bother cleaning them. There's no privacy. There are pins on the
floor. There are cameras, which I suppose you have to have, because
there's so much thievery.''
</P>
<P>
   The ideal dressing room, Halbreich said, would be the size of
Staten Island and furnished with two slipper chairs, a small table,
numerous clothes hooks and bars, and a three-way mirror of high
quality glass. Halbreich, a realist, said she would ``settle for
enough bars in the room to hang the clothes I'm showing, and enough
light to see if what you're buying is black or brown or navy or
mouse.''
</P>
<P>
   Illumination is the most often cited of the many problems
related to fitting-room design. ``The basic issues are as simple as
enough hooks, a good mirror and good lighting, which means
incandescent and fluorescent, but masked,'' said David New, vice
president for creative services at Barneys New York. Underhill
considered that three light settings (day, office, evening) are a
fitting-room necessity. But a dressing room should provide more
than that. It should ``surprise you and make you smile,'' said New,
whose designs include dressing areas with walls of vintage
postcards and Tic Tac packages on Barneys' Co-op floor.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible that the Swedish retailer H&AMP;M was making a
Scandinavian light bulb joke when it designed the dressing rooms of
its hugely successful new Fifth Avenue store _ where each cubicle
has a toggle switch and a sign that reads: ``Would you like to
change the light? If you press the button, the light will change to
a colder daylight, which shows the colors of the garments in a more
natural way.'' When a visitor hit the button the room went abruptly
dark. Color him black.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are three places I like to look in a store,'' Underhill
said. ``The ladies' bathroom, the employee locker room and the
ladies' dressing room. They're all spaces that are an important
part of forming the customer connection, and that give you a sense
of the corporate ethos.''
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Lauren Polo stores, Underhill said, display a rare
conceptual follow-through, carrying brand identity from the selling
floor into the dressing room. And it's true that those areas at the
Ralph Lauren flagship on Madison Avenue practically clobber the
customer with the aura of a private men's club: Spy prints and
sepia pictures of vintage sports cars, Chippendale-style chairs
with hairy knees. What matter if it's all a fantasy? Does the
average shopper care that most private men's clubs are likelier to
have snapshots of ancient tennis champions falling out of their
frames, and flaking club chairs with springs that come at you like
rectal thermometers? ``Probably not,'' Underhill said.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to be Thorstein Veblen to recognize that
manufactured illusion is central to consumption. Why, then, has the
intoxication been allowed to leach from so many aspects of
shopping, one of the the core experiences of Western life?
</P>
<P>
   ``We realize it to be an issue,'' said Christina Johnson, chief
executive of Saks Fifth Avenue, which is undergoing a five-year,
$100 million renovation of its 650,000-square-foot Fifth Avenue
store. ``Appropriate environment and appointments are essential to
engaging with the customer. We fall short at times of the standard
that we set for ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Halbreich of Bergdorf's agreed that the shopping environment
counts for everything. ``Management talks about service, but rarely
does anything about it,'' she said. ``In the end, what is the
difference between all these stores? A little knowledge, maybe? A
little taste? Service is all you really have, and it's not service
putting people in cells. The dressing room is more than just a
place to change your clothes. The sale is made in that room.''

THE VALLEY OF DEATH, ANOTHER BOOMER TEST 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, June 25) 
 By DAVID BROOKS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Americans still work out at health clubs because it is not yet
fashionable to get sick and die. But in a few years, the baby
boomers are going to be entering the prime perishing years, and we
all know what that means. They're going to turn dying into a form
of self-expression.
</P>
<P>
   Each and every last boomer is going to strive to make his or her
death a unique and fulfilling ritual. They're going to be taking
adult education classes on the joys of dying well. They'll have
brunch discussions about what music should be on the stereo as one
drifts off into the afterlife. They'll say things like, ``I don't
want to just die, I want to claim ownership of my death,'' and
they'll start buying self-actualizing books with titles like, ``The
Seven Habits of Highly Effective Dead People.'' In short, the
boomers are going to take death and they're going to turn it into a
growth experience.
</P>
<P>
   Already, you can see the age-old rituals being personalized. San
Francisco has a Zen hospice, which _ I couldn't make this up _ is
about to start training ``death companions'' or, as they will also
be known, ``midwives of death.'' The Paradise Memorial Crematory
outside Scottsdale, Ariz., has a Cremation Cam offering Internet
broadcasts of cremations (up to but not into the oven). There are
Web sites like ObitDetails.com, where you can post obituaries
online, and plan4ever.com, where families can have memorial chat
rooms. Soon you'll be able to spam people from beyond the grave.
</P>
<P>
   A company called Celestic Inc. will blast some of your
``cremains'' to the moon for about $12,500, using a rocket launched
by a commercial space company from either Vandenberg Air Force Base
or Cape Canaveral. That means during the last years of your life,
you can look down on those dull vanillas whose ashes are going on
less-extreme adventure vacations than yours are. In dot-com rich
San Francisco, there is fierce competition for water-view burial
plots, with prices for a family plot skyrocketing over $100,000,
which means that dying has become yet one more thing you can't do
without a real estate agent.
</P>
<P>
   And of course, there have already been striking changes in
coffin and mausoleum design. Coffins now come in an infinite array
of looks. A Dallas-based firm, Whitelight, can put a digitally
imaged mural on any ``art casket,'' so people are going six feet
under with designs like ``Fairway to Heaven'' _ a golf course scene
_ and zebra stripes. It's only a matter of time before some boomer
gets lowered down in a container that looks like the album cover of
Pink Floyd's ``Dark Side of the Moon.''
</P>
<P>
   The end result is that we baby boomers are going to transform
the next world just as much as we have transformed this one. It is
not enough that we are going to bankrupt the Social Security
system, give the entire country the demographic profile of Florida
and annoy the planet with our midlife crises. Now we are going to
start having afterlife crises, wondering if our souls are fully
self-actualized.
</P>
<P>
   As for myself, I am preparing for a little post-mortem
one-upmanship. I am laying the groundwork for a truly high-status
death. As I conceive it, my own death takes place many decades
hence at my yet imaginary regular table at the Four Seasons. I have
just received news that my grandchildren have managed to find time
during their Supreme Court clerkships to collaborate on another
best-selling poetry anthology. I beckon to my assistant, Tina
Brown, to read me their latest e-mail again, and I celebrate by
ordering some penne off-menu. But I'm not really paying attention
to the freshness and coloring of my dish as the waiter settles it
in front of me, and instead of enjoying a routine power lunch I
become yet another baby boomer victim of pesto poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   I get dizzy and see a long blue tunnel of light, and coming down
it, the Angel of Death. But it's a special baby boomer Angel of
Death. She's wearing a North Face parka instead of a black robe,
and instead of a scythe she's got a gardening trowel from Smith &AMP;
Hawken. As she gets closer, I see that it's Oprah, who gets to
decide not only which novels will succeed and which will fail, but
also who will live and who will die.
</P>
<P>
   She tells me I am being recycled, which is the new phrase for
it, and she invites me over to her table, which is in a better
location than mine. The heads of the Harvard, Yale and New York
Public Libraries are seated there already squabbling over my
papers. The Angel of Death asks me if I have already detailed my
funeral arrangements on my Palm Pilot, which of course I have.
First I give her the name of the funeral home I have selected, the
one in Alphabet City where all the supermodels go. Then I beam over
my embalming instructions; I've asked to be pumped full of a '69
Bordeaux because my motto is, ``Embalmed but Not Embarrassed.'' I
want an open casket, and in preparation, I'd like a surgeon to get
rid of the bags under my eyes.
</P>
<P>
   I don't look at my remains as a corpse, but as my last chance
for cosmetic surgery. As for the casket, I have a few special
instructions: a sisal interior, because it's so unpretentious, and
a translucent shell, so I don't clash with my iMac. I also want to
have a University of Chicago window sticker attached to the back of
my box, for the sake of educational boasting, and maybe one of
those ACK stickers that signify that I once visited Nantucket.
</P>
<P>
   I've selected a cemetery up the Hudson that bills itself as
``America's Ultimate Gated Community.'' And I confess I've gone a
little overboard on my mausoleum. Actually, I've selected one of
those McMausoleums _ the big marble structures with two-story great
rooms, four-car garages and newly renovated kitchens. It's vulgar,
I know, but I couldn't see spending all of eternity without a
Jacuzzi in the master bathroom suite.
</P>
<P>
   I can see the Angel of Death is impressed by the care I've taken
with my arrangements, and she mutters about looking forward to
telling Narcissus. As a final gesture, I blast-fax the obituary
I've written for myself, with instructions to run it above the
fold. Then I settle back and prepare to meet my Maker, secure in
the knowledge I've achieved the boomer ultimate: I've gone from
ashes to ashes, dust to dust, without once stopping along the way
at maturity.

 A NIGHTOUT WITH ERIC McCORMACK: DIVA FOR A DAY

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Eric McCormack's wife didn't stand a chance Wednesday
night at the Amfar benefit at Ellis Island. Though she looked
pretty in her polka dot dress and a peony corsage, Janet McCormack
was outnumbered competing for her husband's attention. It was,
after all, an AIDS benefit, and McCormack, the evening's MC, had to
keep 700 mostly gay men feeling generous during a four-hour
program.
</P>
<P>
   A straight Canadian-born actor may seem an unlikely draw for an
AIDS fund-raiser, whose headliners are typically gay icons like
Liza Minnelli and Elton John. But McCormack is the star of NBC's
``Will &AMP; Grace,'' the sitcom in which he plays a gay Manhattan
lawyer whose best friend is a straight woman.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, he was having a hard time stepping out of
character. Primped up in a black suit by Banana Republic, paired
with a parrot green shirt and matching silk tie, the handsome and
affable McCormack camped it up, showing off vintage postcards of
Elizabeth Taylor he had bought while window shopping earlier that
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fabulous,'' one man said. ``He's perfect boyfriend material,''
another whispered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was called a fag since I was 2,'' McCormack said, explaining
that growing up he was shy and didn't play sports. ``When I started
this show, my biggest fear was that the community wouldn't accept
me.''
</P>
<P>
   By 7:15, the crowd was lining up for cocktails in the baggage
room of the registry building as McCormack greeted Mario M. Cuomo
and others near the paparazzi pen. ``I had to miss an event for
Harry Belafonte,'' said the former governor, who was there to
deliver a keynote speech on AIDS activism.
</P>
<P>
   At 8, a medley of salmon, chicken and filet mignon was served
upstairs under a vaulted ceiling decorated with the AIDS Memorial
Quilt. ``I keep seeing guards walking around,'' said Larry Kramer,
the playwright and founder of Act Up, pointing to the prisonlike
catwalk that circles the room. He was among the nine who were
honored by Amfar that night.
</P>
<P>
   McCormack took the stage to deliver introductory remarks. ``As a
straight man playing a gay role,'' he began, but the audio system
could not compete with the din of forks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's great,'' said James Dale, the telegenic Boy Scout
whose gay rights case is expected to be decided before the Supreme
Court any day, ``but we also need openly gay people on
television.''
</P>
<P>
   By dessert, a flock of admirers were surrounding McCormack.
``I'm a better leading actor as a gay man than I've ever been in a
straight role,'' he said. ``I'm just being me.''
</P>
<P>
   McCormack's limelight suffered a temporary blackout with the
arrival of the supernova of the AIDS charity circuit: Elizabeth
Taylor. Dr. Mathilde Krim, Amfar's chairwoman, took over host
duties to introduce ``the only person in the world who doesn't need
an introduction.''
</P>
<P>
   A gasp could be heard as Taylor, escorted by a phalanx of
security guards, swept onto the stage, wearing a pink organza gown.
You could have heard an AIDS ribbon pin drop as she spoke for six
minutes about ``strength, courage and fortitude,'' before she was
whisked away. ``It was like the coming of the president of the
United States,'' said Matt Coles, the director of the American
Civil Liberties Union's AIDS Project.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly half a million dollars had been netted in ticket sales
that evening, in addition to $60,000 that McCormack raised by
auctioning walk-on parts for his show. ``You really do get to kiss
me,'' he said after announcing a winning bid.
</P>
<P>
   As the event wound down at 11, McCormack got a final laugh when
he bid adieu to the partygoers and said, ``There's a couple of big
fairies waiting for you outside.''

FROM HARD DRIVES LOST TO HATE CRIMES LAWS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By J.R. LABBE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   News snippets worth noting:
</P>
<P>
   LOS ALAMOS: Thank heavens for that office copier maintenance
contract, or those hard drives would still be missing! The most
troubling aspect of the wayward computer components isn't that they
were out of the chain of custody for up to six months. No, it's the
thought that if the Energy Department will publicly cop to this
kind of incompetence, what's going on that we don't know about?
</P>
<P>
   Banish the thought. Better yet, banish Energy Secretary Bill
Richardson. Time for him to, as they say, to crowd the plate and
take one for the team.
</P>
<P>
   JANE FONDA: The actress formerly known as Hanoi Jane finally
said she will ``go to my grave regretting the photograph of me,''
referring to the much publicized and highly criticized 1972 picture
of her behind the sights of a North Vietnamese anti-aircraft gun.
According to the July-August issue of O, the Oprah Winfrey
magazine, Fonda admits the hurt she caused American soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   I take that as an apology. Time to write finis to that ugly
chapter of American history.
</P>
<P>
   HATE CRIME LEGISLATION: The U.S. Senate passed legislation this
week that would add offenses motivated by sexual orientation,
gender or disability to the list of hate crimes covered under a
1968 federal law.
</P>
<P>
   The sliding scale of justice continues. This needless piece of
law will make it possible for judges to issue stiffer punishments
for ``hate crimes,'' which are somehow worse than run-of-the-mill
murders. My puzzlement remains: Aren't all deliberate, intentional
crimes acts of hatred? No, say the senators _ motivation is more of
a determining factor than the final outcome.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that this bill has a cloudy future in the
Senate, seeing as how it was attached as an amendment to a massive
defense bill (makes perfect sense to me). And the House has
previously rejected almost identical legislation.
</P>
<P>
   DEATH PENALTY: One of my colleagues wrote a column Wednesday
that primarily consisted of the names of the 221 people executed by
the state of Texas since 1982 _ ``when the state resumed killing
people,'' as he so bluntly put it. His point was something about
the number of potential innocents that the state has executed, as
many of these people went to their graves claiming innocence.
</P>
<P>
   If only I could get the newsprint it would take to list the
names of all the victims of those convicted of murder since 1982.
</P>
<P>
   For the sake of balance, let's put capital punishment into
perspective. Since 1977 _ when executions resumed after the Supreme
Court, a year earlier, refused to ban capital punishment _ about
400,000 people have been convicted of murder in the United States.
Less than 1 percent of that number received the death penalty. Only
a fraction of those have actually been carried out.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, many of the executed claimed actual innocence up to the
end. But reviews of capital cases show that most Death Row
prisoners never make factual innocence claims in the appeals
process because _ hello _ they aren't.
</P>
<P>
   ``In only a handful of death row appeals are there claims of
actual innocence that are not patently absurd,'' wrote Robert V.
Pambianco, chief policy counsel to the Washington Legal Foundation,
for The Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   Much is being made about the 87 Death Row prisoners who were
saved from execution by DNA tests and new evidence. That's just
proof that the system is not capricious and arbitrary, but rather
goes to the ``nth'' degree to make sure that only the guilty die
for their crimes.
</P>
<P>
   As Pambianco wrote, death penalty opponents aren't arguing about
the morality of capital punishment or that specific prisoners
shouldn't be executed. Rather, he said, they contend that the
system is hopelessly flawed and likely to lead to the execution of
many innocent people. And the mainstream media have swallowed the
perception that innocent people have already been put to death.
</P>
<P>
   The dent in the armor: There is no evidence, anywhere, of a case
in which an innocent person has been executed since 1900.

GETTING PAST AN AFFAIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ERICK MELLON  
 c. 2000 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A love affair can be either a death knell or a wake-up call for
couples, Janis Abrahms Spring contends.
</P>
<P>
   Spring is an expert on infidelity. The Westport, Conn.,
psychologist wrote After the Affair: Healing the Pain and
Rebuilding Trust When a Partner Has Been Unfaithful (HarperCollins
1997) and gives lectures to her peers nationwide. She was in the
Kansas City area recently to talk with counselors and
psychologists.
</P>
<P>
   In her book Spring emphasizes that ``after'' does not
necessarily mean the end. She tells couples dealing with an affair
``to step into the center of the ring, remove your boxing gloves
and join hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Many couples have this match to fight. Spring says one in every
2.7 couples in the United States is affected by an affair. And with
the increased popularity of the Internet, she says, virtual affairs
have become more common.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, she shares some of her insight.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How do you define an affair?
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally an affair refers to the violation of sexual
exclusivity in a marriage. ... But this is a very narrow definition
because it refers only to sexual intercourse, only to married
couples, only to heterosexual couples. And affairs go way beyond
those dimensions. So I say that an affair is not necessarily about
sex but about secrets and a violation of trust.
</P>
<P>
   Q. You write that it is possible for a relationship to survive
an affair. Does this belief surprise many people?
</P>
<P>
   Many people believe once the trust is broken, the relationship
is broken. But the truth is, we don't really know how we'd react to
something until it happens. Affairs happen to good people in good
relationships, too. The process of making sense of what went wrong
can be a growth process.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How is it possible to survive?
</P>
<P>
   I have found that there are three essential ingredients to
healing.
</P>
<P>
   (First), unfaithful partners have to be willing to apologize
generously and often, to understand the harm they've caused. The
second essential ingredient is unfaithful partners have to be
willing to look deeply within themselves and understand why they
strayed so it never happens again. Third, unfaithful partners have
to be willing to earn back trust.
</P>
<P>
   Trust is not a cheap gift. It's something the unfaithful person
earns. And how do they earn it? By doing little things everyday
that make the hurt partner feel loved and safe.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How have the Internet and chat rooms complicated the picture?
</P>
<P>
   Because the Internet is so accessible, anonymous and cheap,
people use it easily, secretly and they don't tend to see it as a
violation of the relationship. In reality, people are spending
hours talking graphically and pornographically to people they'll
not only never touch, but also never see.
</P>
<P>
   But when their partner finds out, they experience a very
profound shattering and violation because affairs are about
secrets. Plus, all the energy is going into these cybersex
relationships. The life of the marital relationship is drained.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What advice can you give couples so that one partner doesn't
stray?
</P>
<P>
   The greatest antidote is when partners take responsibility for
their personal issues.
</P>
<P>
   If in your early years you were abandoned or abused, you may
grow up not feeling safe in relationships. You cannot trust people
fully and cannot love fully, and you go in search of one partner
after another. Or it could be you weren't valued as a child. These
vulnerabilities often are underlying the attraction to another
person.
</P>
<P>
   The second piece of advice is never take your partner for
granted and understand how relationships need to be nourished
everyday.
</P>
<P>
   Q. When is it not right to stay together after an affair?
</P>
<P>
   When people ask me, ``What's my success rate,'' I say I don't
base my success on whether partners stay together but whether they
make a thoughtful decision about that.
</P>
<P>
   For some people it's better to get out. For other people, they
need help staying in and not leaving the relationship. I'm not for
preserving the relationship at any cost.

SIZING UP BUSH VS. GORE ON RETIREMENT-AID PLANS
</HEADLINE>

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 25)  
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Few issues point up the ideological gulf between the likely
major-party presidential candidates more clearly than their
approaches to inducing Americans to save more for retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, the Democrat, wants the government to
provide a subsidy of as much as $3 for each $1 that a worker kicks
in to his or her retirement kitty; this proposed new entitlement
program is intended to favor the relative have-nots. Gov. George W.
Bush of Texas, the tax-cutting Republican, will probably endorse a
plan under which the kitty will be fattened by redirecting taxes
that now help finance Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides have in common a recognition that voters want the
long-term adequacy of Social Security to be seriously debated, not
avoided as taboo. And they share a belief that shortfalls in
retirement security are best made up in the financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was first to publicly sketch out a plan. But the vice
president, who used to attack the idea of investing Social Security
money in stocks, has laid out his proposal in much greater detail.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the debate has been joined in earnest, some investment
advisers have begun tentatively sizing up the competing plans,
neither of which is yet concrete enough to reward close financial
scrutiny. Indeed, Bush has yet to provide the most crucial single
number: the portion of the 12.4 percent Social Security tax, half
paid by employers, that he would divert into private investment
accounts. That, he contends, is a job for legislators.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the vagueness, though, one preliminary finding has
emerged: Assuming that cash can be spared to take advantage of the
government's matching offer, for most people Gore offers more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Gore plan would be better,'' at least in terms of the
greatest benefit for the greatest number, said Thomas P.
Ochsenschlager, a specialist in personal taxation in the Arlington,
Va., office of Grant Thornton, the accounting firm. He pointed to
the way it would give a couple earning $30,000 a year and able to
save $1,000 in the plan an extra $3,000 in matching money, and to
how it would leave existing Social Security benefits unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   But the Gore plan becomes much less attractive as incomes rise,
with the matching money dwindling to zero for households earning
more than $100,000. And other advisers, looking beyond the raw
figures, take a dimmer view.
</P>
<P>
   ``My clients would be hard-pressed to see that they would
benefit from the Gore plan,'' said Carol I. Johnson, a financial
planner at Voellinger, Simpson &AMP; Associates, an accounting firm in
Belleville, Ill. She said this group, 30 percent of whom have
household incomes of less than $100,000, are more interested in
ensuring the solvency of Social Security, which is neither
``fixed'' nor undermined by the Gore plan, than they are in a new
entitlement program.
</P>
<P>
   Under Gore's proposal, which would be voluntary and phased in
over 10 years, the government's match would take the form of a tax
credit _ a dollar-for-dollar reduction in income tax. The credit
would be refundable, meaning that if it exceeded your income tax
liability, the Treasury would write you a check for the difference.
</P>
<P>
   Your money would be pooled with the government's in a
tax-deferred account managed by professionals who would invest it
broadly, avoiding individual stocks. A typical household could
expect the account to swell to about $200,000 over 35 years,
according to plan's architects. Funds could be tapped without
penalty for college tuition, heavy medical expenses or a first
home.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is much bolder, proposing to modify the Social Security
system itself, an initiative that he will bill as addressing
impending shortfalls in funding, but that invites criticism that he
would put the system in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   He has said he wants to allow workers to divert an unspecified
share of the Social Security taxes they and their employers pay
into personal accounts that they would manage themselves. In
return, the workers would agree to accept a smaller guaranteed
retirement benefit from Social Security, which would be deprived of
the diverted revenue.
</P>
<P>
   A wide variety of specific proposals could fit into what Bush
calls his ``framework.'' But one plan being promoted by a close
Bush adviser, Martin S. Feldstein of Harvard University, is a
suitable proxy. Feldstein would have the government deposit 2
percent of each individual's income into a privately managed
portfolio, three-fifths invested in stocks and two-fifths in
corporate bonds, a mix that would have yielded a 6 percent annual
return, adjusted for inflation, over the last 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Feldstein, who served as chief economic adviser to the Reagan
Administration, calculates that a 21-year-old who follows this plan
to retirement would have an even chance of beating the currently
projected Social Security benefit by at least one-third;
conversely, he figures that the chances of winding up with less
than 90 percent of what Social Security alone would have yielded
are below 1 in 10.
</P>
<P>
   While financial planners say it is not yet possible to compare
the plans with any rigor, they tend to prefer that of Bush, perhaps
because it is skewed to favor the well-to-do who are their main
clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 60-40 plan sounds better,'' said W. Michael Cooper, a
planner in Lexington, Ky. ``This business about the tax credit I'm
not comfortable with,'' he added, citing administrative complexity
and opportunity for fraud, among other factors.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Steve Garrett, manager of financial planning services at AG
Edwards, the St. Louis-based brokerage firm, said he doubted
whether lower-income families could muster even the modest amount
of cash needed to qualify for Gore's credits.
</P>
<P>
   Many workers taking part in the Gore plan would do so with money
otherwise destined for 401(k) plans, which would throw the balance
of lower-paid and higher-paid workers in such plans out of kilter
and severely limit employers' ability to offer them, according to
Dan Halpin of Grant Thornton.
</P>
<P>
   Paul A. Levis of Summit Financial Consultants in Yonkers, N.Y.,
said that even the Bush-Feldstein plan, with its 40 percent bond
requirement, would be too timidly invested for his taste. Referring
to his daughter, Ashlie, who recently graduated from college, he
asked, ``Why not give her the ability to put 100 percent'' in stock
mutual funds?
</P>
<P>
   Then there was Mary B. Hevener, a payroll tax expert for Weil,
Gotshal &AMP; Manges, who said she was ``hard-pressed to say which one
is worse,'' a generous-to-the-poor Gore plan that seems to invite
wholesale cheating or a Bush plan that she said risks aggravating,
rather than reducing, the threat posed to the Social Security
system by the aging of the baby boom generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The richer and older you are, the more you're going to go
toward Bush,'' Hevener said, but ``the crooks are going to like
Gore better.''

`PEOPLE CAN'T AFFORD THAT' _ BUT DO WE CARE?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM WRIGHT 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Washington today, I find a pervading forgetfulness of the
fellow it's all supposed to be about _ the guy we used to call
``the common man.'' (Let's add ``and woman.'')
</P>
<P>
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan seems to make the big
economic decisions unilaterally. He has raised interest rates
again, four consecutive times, and we hear not a peep.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the cumulative effect of these recent increases will cost a
young family purchasing a $200,000 home a couple of thousand bucks
a year more in carrying costs.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's concern _ ironic to those of us who remember the
suffering of past recessions _ is that the economy is ``too
exuberant,'' investors have ``unrealistic expectations,'' and
unemployment is too low. This is the first time in my memory that
any responsible party has publicly intimated that we'd be better
off with more people unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   The object of my concern is not Greenspan but an official _ and,
to me, heretical _ mind-set that has come to dominate important
policy decisions.
</P>
<P>
   It's a kind of elitist economic attitude in which ordinary
people and what affects them are not really important and therefore
surely not necessary considerations.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan worries about inflation. That's commendable _ part of
his official duty. But there'd been no sign of inflation. Prices
have been remarkably stable for a longer period than anyone can
remember. So why increase interest rates?
</P>
<P>
   During the Korean War, President Harry Truman countermanded a
Federal Reserve decision that would have raised the prime rate to 6
percent from 5.5 percent. ``People can't afford that,'' Truman
said. That memory comforts me.
</P>
<P>
   This one haunts me: In 1980, the Fed raised interest rates,
making inflation palpably worse (it reached 18 percent) at a time
of severe energy shortages. The Fed actually created recession!
Jimmy Carter's presidency was doomed.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to thinking of the national good, planners no
longer seem to consider what's best for those striving to rise from
the bottom of the heap, or how to ensure that prosperity filters
down to them.
</P>
<P>
   Former Labor Secretary Robert Reich reveals that the most
affluent one-fifth of the world's citizens already own 74 times the
wealth of those in the bottom one-fifth. That gap is growing,
having doubled in the past 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   This alarming trend did not result simply from interest rates.
It is the cumulative effect of both deliberate policies and acts of
official neglect by the world's governments. It's an expression of
a new outlook, detached from any sense of economic justice.
</P>
<P>
   One symptom of what's happening was the recent House vote for
repeal of the inheritance tax. About 98 percent of America's
families were already lawfully exempted. A couple today can inherit
up to $1.3 million without paying any tax. The bulk of the revenue
comes from windfall inheritances of $5 million and more.
</P>
<P>
   Yet knowing that we need our hard-won budget surplus to help
keep Social Security solvent, House Republicans voted unanimously
for this give-away that would benefit only the top 2 percent while
costing the Treasury _ and that's all of us _ an estimated $104
billion in lost revenue over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Now we learn that, because of the most recent congressional
welfare overhaul, close to a million low-income parents have lost
Medicaid coverage altogether. In Texas, 51 percent of adult
citizens have no health insurance at all.
</P>
<P>
   How shall we label the emerging philosophy? Is this, possibly,
what Gov. George W. Bush means by ``compassionate conservatism''?
Sen. Pat Moynihan once referred to an unofficial attitude of the
Nixon administration as ``benign neglect.''
</P>
<P>
   It all seems to mean that governments may sympathize with
distress but not alleviate it, endorse equal opportunity but not
enforce it, verbally encourage just results but not pay for them.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever it is, it's a far cry from Harry Truman.
</P>

IN PRAISE OF THE FREEDOM TO TAKE CHANCES

 (For release Sun., June 25)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

   Jeffrey Pfeffer, co-author of ``The Knowing-Doing Gap,'' teaches
organizational behavior at Stanford University, in the heart of
Silicon Valley. In an interview, he described how Internet
companies in particular could learn to put their best ideas into
practice. Following are excerpts from the conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How does the knowing-doing gap apply to e-commerce? Those
companies seem hell-bent on action. Do they really need prodding? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I would quote David Kelley from IDEO Product Development, who
said, ``Enlightened trial and error outperforms the planning of
flawless intellects.'' What is often lost is the word
``enlightened.'' The knowing-doing gap is not just about taking
action _ it's about turning knowledge into action. E-commerce is
obviously about taking action and being fast, but it's also about
being knowledgeable and enlightened. Action without knowledge
doesn't get you very far.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do e-commerce companies already embody what you teach? Many
go to great lengths to foster cooperation and open communication.
</P>
<P>
   A. Some e-commerce companies have done a very good job of doing
what we talk about. Some have not. There's a lot of fear at some of
them, a lot of distrust. At some of them, there's a lot of internal
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Q. But some of them do things right?
</P>
<P>
   A. Actually I think Amazon is pretty good on most of these
dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   They have created a climate in which people feel secure enough
to speak their mind and tell the truth.
</P>
<P>
   I think the paradox you uncover quickly in life is that many
organizations say they want people to learn but they also don't
want them to make any mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Q. To whom is your book directed? The boss? The board? Just
anybody?
</P>
<P>
   A. It is certainly directed at managers at any level who have
the opportunity to create environments. And I don't really believe
that an environment is created only by the CEO. You know, division
managers, department managers, group managers, they have the
opportunity in their local domain, however big or small, to create
an environment that reduces internal competition, reduces fear,
tries to encourage people not to get stuck in the past but to build
a better future for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How does change get going? If bad practices are deeply
embedded, how do you get the ball rolling?
</P>
<P>
   A. I think philosophy comes first. If you're committed to
building a culture in which people really do feel free to take
chances, it truly begins with philosophy and mind-set. Then you
just try stuff and see what works, and you keep innovating.
</P>
<P>
   Q. But does uprooting the old way require breaking some bones,
inflicting some pain?
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't know that it requires inflicting pain or breaking
bones. Look at Continental Airlines. When Gordon Bethune and Greg
Brenneman took it over and decided they were going to run
Continental in a different way.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Continental Airlines was in pretty desperate straits, right?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, pretty desperate. They got rid of the senior management
who had operated under what I would call a fear-based and
anti-employee regime. There does come a point at which you have to
say, ``This is the way we're going to operate, and people who
aren't comfortable with this culture need to find another home.''
But I'm not sure I'd go so far as calling that breaking bones.  &QL;

TOWARD OIL PRICE STABILITY, STEP BY STEP 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, June 25)

<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria _ Dressed modestly in his native collarless
garb, occasionally fingering a strand of prayer beads, Bijan Namdar
Zanganeh, Iran's petroleum minister, led a contingent of similarly
reserved, gray-bearded men who together played the role of wild
card last week during the meeting of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries here.
</P>
<P>
   When high oil prices drove OPEC to raise output in March, the
Iranians, led by Zanganeh, publicly rebelled, complaining of one
too many late-night phone calls to negotiators from Bill
Richardson, the American energy secretary. Ultimately, however,
they increased their country's exports. Last week, with crude oil
once above $30 a barrel and OPEC again under pressure to raise
production, Zanganeh quickly went along with the majority.
</P>
<P>
   After weathering the manic dips and rises of oil prices over the
last 18 months, Zanganeh, like other OPEC representatives, craves
stability, which he believes the plan to raise output by 708,000
barrels a day should afford. It also helped, Zanganeh said, that
there were no more trans-Atlantic phone calls interrupting the
talks.
</P>
<P>
   Zanganeh, born in 1952, is a civil engineer by training. He
became petroleum minister in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   First at a press briefing and then in his hotel suite, Zanganeh
discussed the rationale behind OPEC's latest decisions and their
impact on the global oil market. Following are excerpts from the
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Have you had discussions with U.S. companies about developing
new oil and gas fields?
</P>
<P>
   A. We have had many discussions with U.S. companies. But they
have unacceptable limitations on their activity in Iran placed on
them by the administration. I don't think it's good for open and
free trade. It's a decision that goes against both sides. It
deprives U.S. companies from participating in our projects. We have
money to develop our fields, but we would prefer to have the
participation of first-class foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How did the atmosphere of this OPEC session vary from that of
the last one, which seemed full of tension?
</P>
<P>
   A. We had a very good atmosphere this time. In our last meeting,
all the members complained of U.S. intervention. We didn't feel
external political pressure this time.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How did OPEC arrive at the figure of 708,000 barrels a day?
</P>
<P>
   A. It was a compromise, and we will support it and respect it.
We ourselves will be producing 104,000 barrels a day more. The
decision was not hard, because we had decided before that if the
price got up to $30 a barrel, we would increase production by
500,000 barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   And it's all very close: a matter of oil being $2 more a barrel
than $30 and producing 200,000 barrels more than 500,000 barrels.
That is all much the same.
</P>
<P>
   We only validated our previous decision.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How would you respond to criticism from the United States and
other nations? that this agreement does not go far enough to dampen
high oil prices?
</P>
<P>
   A. We felt we must be very careful in this situation to test the
market. If the market needs more oil, we will produce it. We have
an automatic mechanism for it. And there are only three months
before our next meeting, which will give us time to see the effect
of this decision. Step by step, we will test how much the market
needs.
</P>
<P>
   We are looking for a stable price, not necessarily high or low.
</P>
<P>
   Now we are planning for oil to play a smaller role in our
budget. We would like to use the revenues from oil to create funds
that would support our private sector.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What is the automatic mechanism you have now within OPEC to
increase production if your latest decision does not bring down oil
prices? And why is there so much secrecy around it?
</P>
<P>
   A. This is what you call a gentlemen's agreement. Let's just say
that.

&HT;     TAIWAN APPEARS TO BE IN GOOD HANDS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By HENRY E. CATTO Jr.  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan _ I sat and watched the man at the podium,
acutely aware that he could involve his country _ and ours _ in a
nasty, perhaps nuclear, Asian war. Was he an Indian? A Pakistani? A
Chinese Communist? No, he was Chen Shui-bian. Still don't know him
? Well, he is the new and freely elected president of the Republic
of China, also known as Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   The occasion was Chen's inaugural address. I was there as
chairman of a delegation of U.S. think tank officials who wanted to
meet with the new administration and see that most exciting of
political events, the first turnover of power from one party to
another in a new democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The reason that Americans should care what Chen would say and
what reaction the People's Republic of China reaction would have is
that we are closely bound to both these mortal enemies. We are
bound to Taiwan by treaty, trade and democratic affinity, and to
the mainland by respect for its potential as a world power and our
huge trade with the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   The turnover of power brings the new situation to a head. Taiwan
is now a full-fledged democracy, a developed nation, and no small
beer. With 23 million people, its two-way trade with the United
States has burgeoned to $218 billion, mostly in computer and
electronics products. Once an aid recipient, it is now a grantor of
foreign assistance. Its economy has changed from overwhelmingly
agricultural to industrial, and its purchasing power per capita was
$12,009 in 1998. The mainland's was $3,600. It is our third largest
trading partner and the 14th largest trading nation in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan's trade with the mainland has grown tremendously. There
are 35,000 Taiwanese businesses in China, though heavy industry
development is not permitted by Taipei, lest the island become too
dependent on its rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Indirect trade has grown to $22.5 billion. Ten million Taiwanese
have traveled to China since the unofficial detente between the
two. This travel has proved a mixed blessing for China. While it
has opened the country for investment from Taiwan, many Taiwanese
have returned home disillusioned by China's poverty and its brutal
regime.
</P>
<P>
   The triangular relationship among the United States, Taiwan, and
mainland China is rife with ``cognitive dissonance,'' a term used
by psychiatrists to describe holding two diametrically opposed view
at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   For the United States, we highly value Taiwan's emergence as a
democracy, its vibrant economy, rich with potential sales for
American companies, and its boost for the idea of democratic
solutions to development. At the same time, while we loathe China's
human rights violations and bellicose foreign policy, we like to
take the long view that the ``capitalist road'' will inevitably
lead to more freedom for the Chinese people and trading profits for
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   For Taiwan, the sweet smell of freedom and wealth makes the idea
of being subsumed into poor, chaotic China most unattractive. The
lure of independence is great. Indeed, President Chen's party has
(or had) an independent Taiwan as one of its goals. And it feels it
can count on U.S. support in time of trouble, a confidence not
absolutely justified by the facts, given American fears of a third
war in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   As for China, there is a genuine belief that Taiwan is a
province of China and that it must be returned to the mainland. The
timing is open to negotiation. The communists have even been
rumored to be open to a change of name, perhaps adopting Taiwan's
name of the Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
   They feel the United States is interfering in a strictly
domestic matter. On the other hand, if they lose patience or are
swept away by nationalistic fervor and invade Taiwan, they will, at
a minimum, lose the respect and investment of the United States and
other democracies, and in the worst case, they might feel the sting
of America's military might.
</P>
<P>
   For all three, it is a diplomatic nightmare. For the United
States, there are choices, all unsatisfactory. We can (1) stay out,
regardless; (2) attempt to mediate; (3) pressure Taipei to come to
terms; (4) guarantee Taiwan protection; or (5) take a posture of
Oriental ambiguity and let both sides guess how we will react,
while striving mightily for time via negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   We would hope that China's extraordinary economic progress will
eventually bring moderation in its approach to the issues (though
it is far from certain that a democratic mainland would be
accommodating on the matter).
</P>
<P>
   Thus it is that we would all do well to keep an eye on the
handsome, smiling, bespectacled new president in Taiwan. We will
have a Chen Shui-bian in our future for sure. Fortunately, there is
good reason to think that his thriving country is in good hands.

 &HT;    EDITORIAL: Light years from true surplus, Washington must
maintain focus
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Our leaders are a lot like the football player who celebrates
too early before crossing the goal line. Then he gets the ball
stripped. Then he gets booed off the field.
</P>
<P>
   Washington is trumpeting a surplus. Pay dirt. Actually, all
Washington has done is move the chains. That's something. Ten whole
yards, much dust. But first down is no touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   After many years going into a gale, Washington has found the
wind at its back. A booming economy, plus austerity measures, plus
presidential vetoes that blunted too-generous tax-cuts, will yield
a true annual surplus at the end of this fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's ``surplus'' wasn't even that, if the general fund is
what one has in mind. That surplus relied on excess cash in the
Social Security trust fund. Without that, America would have been
in the red again.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in addition to projecting a true surplus this year _
meaning no padding needed from Social Security _ the Clinton
administration is projecting a $1.9 trillion surplus by the year
2010.
</P>
<P>
   That would be stunning, but not worth celebrating, since we'd
still be trillions of dollars short of paying off the national
debt.
</P>
<P>
   Right now that debt is $5.7 trillion _ $2.2 trillion of which
the government owes to its own trust funds, including Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's budget envisions eliminating the national
debt entirely by 2013. That sounds futuristic. In the
present-tense, leaders and candidates are far more interested in
cutting taxes or spending than in curbing that debt.
</P>
<P>
   Republican presidential hopeful George W. Bush wants a $1
trillion tax cut over 10 years. His rival, Vice President Al Gore,
wants to use annual surpluses to pay down debt and pay some of the
IOUs held by Social Security. However, Gore also talks of a
``Social Security-plus'' 401(k)-style retirement option, government
matching contributions by as much as $3 for every $1, that could
cost $200 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's proposal for taking a 2 percent slice from Social
Security taxes to allow recipients to invest in the stock market
relies on economic prosperity and, if not, unknown cuts in benefits
to make everything add up.
</P>
<P>
   It is unwise, indeed silly to proceed with the notion that the
current economic boom will last another 13 years. That's unlikely,
maybe impossible. Washington must be more cautious with its
promises.
</P>
<P>
   What a grand day it would be if in 2013 we could retire the debt
and dance in the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   But we aren't even to midfield yet.

SURVIVING THE HAMPTONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, June 25)  
 By BOB MORRIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   An island village. The end of the weekend. An oversubscribed
jitney back to civilization. An angry mob encircles and entraps it
until the police come. This is not an episode of ``Survivor,'' the
CBS reality television series that pits 16 castaways against one
another as they vote each other off their island, one per week.
Rather, it's another true tale of survival in the Hamptons, where
people drive tanklike cars to battle for parking spaces, litigate
like tribal warriors and endure monsoons of bad press, and even
jail.
</P>
<P>
   Last Labor Day, a weekender too embarrassed to give her name was
leaving Jimmy Buffett's party in Sag Harbor when she was arrested
for drunken driving, then locked up in Riverhead. ``They wouldn't
even let me get my pashmina shawl out of my car,'' she said. ``So I
spent the night in nothing but a little lime green vintage cocktail
dress.''
</P>
<P>
   A true survivor, she was back this Memorial Day weekend to dine
out on her tale.
</P>
<P>
   Sarongs. Desperation. Control freaks. Tiki torches. Competition
between South and East. Hipsters in status sneakers. Back-stabbing.
Eating obsessions. The occasional black person. The Hamptons and
``Survivor'' have so much in common that it's hard to tell the two
contests of wits and wills apart.
</P>
<P>
   One island has punitive ``island council'' meetings. The other
has a local judge administering a verbal spanking and a $2,000 fine
to Puffy Combs for giving loud parties. One has exhausting relay
races with people competing for buried treasure. The other has
back-to-back parties competing for guests and charity dollars. One
has immunity idols. The other has matinee idols. Both are crawling
with sand crabs, stylists and cameras, one for network television,
the other for a ``Real World''-type Internet series on
HamptonsTV.com about a summer share _ recently cited by the town of
Southampton. Both have islanders with coveted building skills
(contractors are gods in the Hamptons) and clever map readers like
Jodi Della Femina, author of ``Jodi's Shortcuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, both have high-strung people in a beautiful setting
watching each other's every ugly move.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Donna Karan, Alec Baldwin and Martha Stewart (who
braved a recent fire in her Lily Pond Lane home), the photographer
Patrick Demarchelier is a survivor who knows how to avoid trouble.
He keeps three boats in Three Mile Harbor in East Hampton and
rarely goes ashore. ``People like to go to parties, and it is so
boring,'' said Demarchelier, who is French. ``City people don't
like the country, but in life, you have to love nature. If you
don't understand the tree and the ocean, you are in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   You also have to understand migratory traffic patterns. ``I
think the answer is to get out there early and then not leave your
house all weekend,'' said Rona Jaffe, whose latest novel, ``The
Road Taken,'' is being published this month and whose iHamptons.com
column takes on issues like firewood-stealing neighbors. Her social
endurance is often tested.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't stand being in a home that makes me feel like I'm in a
museum,'' she said. ``I went to Jay Chiat's house for a Planned
Parenthood benefit, and he had a red rope in front of the bedroom.
Did he think I was going to jump up and down on his bed?'' Well, at
least Chiat's guests could use the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, in the wake of vociferous carping over his proposed
new pier and house renovation, Tommy Mottola fled the Hamptons.
This year, Billy Joel sold Jerry Seinfeld his house and retreated
to Nassau County. The Baroness Milly de Cabrol won't be back,
either. ``We rented a house last July and there was a construction
pit next door so that the noise was worse than Manhattan,'' she
said. ``This year I'm going to Tangier, which won't be nearly as
dusty.''
</P>
<P>
   Paolo Zampolli, the president of ID Model Management, meanwhile,
is giving up the Hamptons on the Fourth of July for Brazil. ``It's
easier to go to Brazil,'' said Zampolli, who got on and off the
island last summer by helicopter, ``and it's cheaper.''
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Hamlisch is gone. Lee Radziwill is, too, at least for the
season. Then there's Michael M. Thomas, the Old Hamptons novelist
who rages against the New Hamptons in his New York Observer column.
He sold his Sag Harbor home and has moved to Dumbo, the area in
Brooklyn under the Manhattan Bridge. ``I think life in the Hamptons
is poison to writers,'' he said. ``Brooklyn feels more like Sag
Harbor than Sag Harbor as it is now.''
</P>
<P>
   Other casualties? The party-giving Wilzig brothers are selling
their Water Mill castle. The 516 area code is gone for good.
Maya's, the St. Bart's restaurant that arrived triumphally in
Wainscott last season, was not a survivor, even with children of
the rich and famous waiting tables. ``It had high prices, valet
parking and too much attitude,'' one wag sniped.
</P>
<P>
   Week by week, summer by summer, season by season, we watch with
cannibalistic glee as alliances are made and broken by tan people
circling each other and driven by fierce inner fires of
opportunism.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Courtney Sale Ross has replaced Ira Rennert, builder
of a massive and massively reviled Sagaponack house, as the newest
problem member of the Hamptons mogul tribe. ``She wants to build a
big institute in the woods,'' said Steven Gaines, the ``Philistines
at the Hedgerow'' author and the founder of iHamptons.com. ``We
would love to vote her off the island.''
</P>
<P>
   Extinguish your torch, Ross. It may be time for you to go.

&HT;     A LITTLE SOMETHING FOR EVERYBODY IN NEW CARREY FLICK 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By KRIS WORRELL  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let's get right to the disclaimer. The following people may be
offended by ``Me, Myself &AMP; Irene'': African-Americans, lesbians,
animal lovers, the disabled, midgets, parents, albinos, Germans,
members of Mensa and anyone with good taste.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, there's something for everybody in the new
comedy from brothers Peter and Bobby Farrelly (``Kingpin,''
``There's Something About Mary''), who have built a career on
grossing out audiences. ``Me, Myself &AMP; Irene'' reunites the
filmmakers with Jim Carrey, who also starred in their 1994 debut,
``Dumb and Dumber.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie follows a similar format to ``Mary,'' their hilarious
1998 hit, with a hapless dork at the center of a love triangle.
Charlie Baileygates (Carrey) is a 17-year veteran of the Rhode
Island police force whose wife has left him and their three sons.
Charlie is an affable doormat, the kind of guy who just smiles when
a neighbor steals his newspaper and lets his dog poop in Charlie's
yard.
</P>
<P>
   But one day Charlie snaps and out comes Hank, Charlie's rude,
mean, violent alter-ego. Hank exacts revenge _ and then some _ on
almost everyone who has abused Charlie over the years. Let's just
say you wouldn't want to be Hank's neighbor (who receives one of
Hank's more graphic paybacks).
</P>
<P>
   Charlie is diagnosed with split-personality disorder, a premise
that gives Carrey ample opportunity to deliver his usual goofy,
gangly-limbed, rubber-faced, hyperkinetic performance. A scene in
which his two personalities engage in a raucous fistfight with each
other is classic Carrey.
</P>
<P>
   Having Carrey play a character with two personalities is hardly
a stretch. In fact, it could almost be a metaphor for Carrey's
career, one that finds the talented actor mesmerizing audiences
with dramas like ``The Truman Show'' one minute and mucking around
in low-brow comedies like ``Ace Ventura'' the next.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie is dispatched to drive Irene (Renee Zellweger), a
suspect in a hit-and-run case, from Rhode Island to upstate New
York. On the way, they are intercepted by a gratuitous subplot
involving crooked cops, the EPA and a golf course.
</P>
<P>
   Gags land in front of the pair, literally, for no particular
reason and with such frequency that the movie sometimes seems more
like a series of skits than a feature film _ perhaps because the
script, written initially in 1990 by the Farrellys, was unearthed
after the success of ``Mary'' and rewritten by the brothers and a
childhood friend. Like some second-rate prom date, ``Irene'' lacks
the cleverness and witty twists of ``Mary.''
</P>
<P>
   Carrey pulls out all the stops here, but one of the film's
weaknesses is that it relies too heavily on the actor's charisma
and physical comedy to carry it. And while he delivers plenty of
charm and chuckles, Carrey can only make so many sex-toy jokes,
contort his face and flail his arms before the whole idea of two
Jim Carreys begins to wear thin.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that, unlike in ``Mary,'' in which Ben Stiller
played off the solid performances of Cameron Diaz and Matt Dillon
as well as a cast of zany supporting characters, Carrey is pretty
much on his own here. Zellweger plays Irene, the love interest,
with the same sweet softness she brought to her role in ``Jerry
Maguire,'' but it doesn't work as well here _ she simply doesn't
have Diaz's sunny goofiness or comedic timing.
</P>
<P>
   And the supporting characters aren't much help, either. You
won't find anyone in this film as creepy and hilarious as Chris
Elliot's zit-faced stalker, or even the crotch-crunching pooch in
``Mary.'' Charlie's three high-school-age sons are funny at first,
until the one-joke premise on which they're based runs out of
steam.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me, Myself &AMP; Irene'' might as well be called ``The Carrey
Show.'' You'll laugh, you'll cringe, but there's still something
about ``Mary.''

HEY, EVERYBODY, LET'S START A HEDGE FUND! 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, June 25)  
 By PATRICK McGEEHAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The newspaper ad for the 90-minute seminar was clear
and, apparently, compelling, because it drew more than 250 people
to an auditorium in Midtown Manhattan to learn how to start a hedge
fund.
</P>
<P>
   You might think that hedge funds, those unregulated investment
pools that are reserved for the rich and powerful, had fallen out
of favor after two of the most famous managers, George Soros of the
Quantum Fund and Julian Robertson of Tiger Management, threw in
their monogrammed towels. If so, you may not be cut out to be a
``hedgie.''
</P>
<P>
   If, however, you see the failures of others as beacons
illuminating a bright, shining opportunity, you may have just what
it takes to, say, force the devaluation of the British pound, as
Soros did in 1992, or threaten the stability of the Western world,
as Long-Term Capital Management did in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   It takes something else: As was noted fairly early in the
seminar, you'll need $5 million to $10 million from your friends
and family to start. It was not clear how many of these prospective
hedgies were daunted by the price of admission to this club, but it
was a good sign for the hosts that nobody got up and walked out
upon hearing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to start because you havepeople who want you to
manage their money or because you have personal wealth, family
wealth,'' said Robin Davis, a managing director of Banc of America
Securities, the brokerage firm that sponsored the gathering last
Monday. Nobody without a sentimental tie is going to hand over
large sums to a manager who has not established a track record as
an investor, he said.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed unlikely that everybody in this crowd, a mix of young
men in golf shirts and gray-haired men in suits _ along with a few
women _ had a silver spoon or a golden Rolodex. But in this era of
dot-com billionaires, $10 million may not count as real money.
</P>
<P>
   Davis and the lawyers and accounting specialists who were
co-sponsors of the seminar made it clear that they stood ready to
provide their services to anybody in the audience who could round
up a grubstake. What would those services comprise? Map-reading for
starters.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Tannenbaum, a partner in Tannenbaum Helpern Syracuse &AMP;
Hirschtritt, a New York law firm, pointed on a wall-size map to
some of the popular havens for hedge funds that cater to investors
seeking to avoid United ates taxes. Among the places he noted were
Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, the Isle of Man and ``a little island
off the coast of Madagascar called Mauritius.''
</P>
<P>
   Why might we want to run a hedge fund from the Indian Ocean?
Because, Tannenbaum explained, Mauritius has a treaty with India
that makes it an ideal site for managing investments in emerging
markets. Likewise, Cyprus has a treaty that comes in handy for
people who want to invest in Russia, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A bonus, he added, is that there are ``great golf courses in
some of these tax havens, as you might imagine.''
</P>
<P>
   Tannenbaum and Gerald Ranzal, a partner in the accounting firm
Anchin, Block &AMP; Anchin, also ran through some of the regulatory
pitfalls that threaten hedge-fund profits, including a variety of
local and federal taxes and a web of securities laws that tightly
restrict what hedgies can say about their funds and to whom they
can say it. A hedge fund that is not careful could find itself
subject to the same legislation that governs lowly mutual funds,
the Investment Company Act of 1940.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the one to avoid,'' Tannenbaum warned.
</P>
<P>
   It was Ranzal who homed in on the details that the audience
wanted to hear: The typical hedge-fund manager keeps 1 percent of
all the money invested and 20 percent of the gains on the remaining
99 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the hosts acknowledged, there has been a lot of negative
publicity about hedge funds since John Meriwether's Long-Term
Capital melted down and Soros and Robertson left the business. But
the recent past, they said, isn't the only prologue.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the greatest business there is in the world,'' Davis
said from the stage. ``The fees you can generate are really
limitless.''

 &HT;    Can N.Y. rampage be explained?
 &HT;    By Maureen Downey
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A lawyer for one of the men arrested in the Central
Park ``wilding case'' contends that it was ``a wet-T-shirt contest
that got out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   The 18 men arrested so far include a New York police officer's
younger brother, a minister's son and a father of two. Some had no
history of serious crime. It was hot, they said. They were
drinking. They just wanted to have fun.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 40 men participated in the roving assaults on 53
women and girls following the Puerto Rican Day Parade. Victims
ranged in age from 14 to 40. But if this was just another example
of ``boys will be boys,'' what's wrong with our boys?
</P>
<P>
   It would be convenient to blame the Sunday afternoon rampage on
an underclass of antisocial young thugs. So how do we account for
the hundreds of other men in Central Park who stood by as the
attacks took place, either gawking or capturing the degradation on
home video? None apparently bothered to use their ubiquitous cell
phones to call 911.
</P>
<P>
   Social commentators are lining up the usual suspects. It's the
misogynist nature of rap music. It's the blatant exploitation of
women in films. It's advertising that depicts women as sex objects.
It's a lying, skirt-chasing president in the White House. It's the
macho Latin culture.
</P>
<P>
   Then, there are the media, which replayed videos of half-naked
women fleeing the mob. If those images were supposed to convey the
horror of the attacks and thus deter others, they failed miserably.
</P>
<P>
   A few days after the tapes aired, Buffalo police arrested two
13-year-old boys who tossed water at two girls, chased them and,
after cornering one of them, ripped off her shirt and bra and
fondled her. The victims were 11.

 &HT;    Pontiac Grand Am appealing
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Although its styling runs ahead of its performance,
the Pontiac Grand Am still offers a balance of features that makes
it the division's best-selling car.
</P>
<P>
   Cat-eye headlamps, twin front grilles and round fog lamps give
the Grand Am instant recognition as a Pontiac, while the interior
appointments and layout show the General Motors corporate stamp
with rounded and recessed dials, too-small stereo radio controls
and working drink holders.
</P>
<P>
   Pricing and availability of models are definite pluses, with
Grand Ams starting at $16,455 for a base coupe and going through
SE1 and SE2 versions before topping out at $21,885 for a GT1 sedan.
The standard engine is a 150-horsepower four-cylinder, with a
170-/175-hp V-6 available. The stronger engine will enable the
Grand Am to deliver some of the performance promised by its sporty
look.
</P>
<P>
   In sedan form, as the test SE1 tagged at $20,005 showed, the
Grand Am is a useful car that can serve a family of four well.
Leave the coupe to singles and couples with no kids, because of the
expected difficulty of rear entry. Cargo room is good with a
14.6-cubic-feet trunk, but the opening is on the smallish side,
making it awkward to load packages and objects, for which the trunk
has plenty of space.
</P>
<P>
   Traction control and anti-lock brakes are standard on all Grand
Ams, and there's even a five-speed Getrag transmission offered on
some models _ not, however, with the V-6, which comes only with an
automatic. The four-speed is smooth enough, but the test Grand Am's
console-mounted shifter did spend a lot of time in the ``3''
position in order to have decent acceleration, particularly in
speed-up, slow-down expressway traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The four-cylinder engine, which generates peak horsepower at a
decidedly noisy 5,600 rpm, does make all 155 pounds-feet of its
torque at a more utilitarian 4,400 rpm. This, however, is not an
engine so quiet that anyone is likely to attempt to start it only
to find it running.
</P>
<P>
   The Grand Am's ride is on the firm side, but not uncomfortably
so. The power steering and brakes have a fair degree of feel, but
the Grand Am is not a great-handling car. It can be pushy and slow
to come around in turns and on entry/exit ramps.
</P>
<P>
   But, as indicated by its sales-leading status, the Grand Am has
the features and utility to give it the appeal vital to success in
the compact class.

&HT;     MALE BONDING: GOOD, BAD, SOMETIMES UGLY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (Eds: FIXES 8th graf, removing extra word ``announcement)  
 &HT;    (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By WILLIAM WONG  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PIEDMONT, Calif. _ It may not be obvious, but football star
Steve Young's retirement announcement and the New York Central Park
assaults have something
</P>
<P>
   in common _ male bonding.
</P>
<P>
   The Young event showed male bonding at its sweetest and
gentlest. The New York incident was male bonding at its most vile.
Nonetheless, both high-profile occurrences reminded the world that
men commune with one another in ways that subordinate women.
</P>
<P>
   This affirmation of maleness comes at a wholly ambivalent period
in contemporary male-female relations in the Western world.
Feminist struggles have yielded remarkable gains for women. They
have become well-integrated in the corporate world, as well as in
the public sector.
</P>
<P>
   A few women are chief executives of major companies. Two women
from the San Francisco Bay Area are U.S. senators representing
California. The secretary of State is a woman. First lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton is running for U.S. senator from New York. Several
women are prominent national TV sportscasters, long a men-only job.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, feminist victories have engendered a fierce
male backlash, aided in some cases by compliant women. While the
wage gap has narrowed, men still generally out-earn women for doing
the same kind of work.
</P>
<P>
   Culturally, we are in a Playboy retro period in which feminine
pulchritude is highly valued by the mostly male policy makers in
the entertainment world _ and by countless panting young men.
</P>
<P>
   Sexy lingerie purveyors flaunt their stuff all over commercial
TV, popular periodicals and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Young's long-awaited announcement of his retirement from
the San Francisco 49ers was an unfiltered exhibition of male
bonding. When, in his rambling remarks, he thanked all his coaches
and many teammates and even the team's support staff and sports
journalists, one could almost feel the camaraderie Young had
nurtured throughout his prodigious athletic career.
</P>
<P>
   For mere mortals, there might have been a trace of envy. Here
was a handsome man _ gifted in athletic and intellectual ways _ who
had become a heroic figure, now facing perhaps an even brighter
future _ newly married with a baby on the way and numerous options
in the corporate, legal and sports broadcasting world and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Going through the football wars, as Young has, is one
manifestation of male bonding. Another is going through real wars.
</P>
<P>
   The transition from one millennium to the next has brought us
many retrospectives on the great wars of the 20th century, and we
have seen countless tributes to veterans of those wars. What comes
across strongly is the bonding among the men who survived.
</P>
<P>
   War is the nastiest of collective human endeavors, yet men who
miraculously manage to escape alive retain indelible feelings about
the shared experience. Those who didn't go through the experience
wouldn't understand.
</P>
<P>
   The Central Park assaults are a form of male bonding gone
haywire. A bunch of guys, fueled by beer and other alcoholic and
perhaps narcotic stimulants, express their base animal instincts
when women approach. It's not just a herd of New York schmoes who
behave like wild dogs in heat.
</P>
<P>
   Remember the Tailhook incident of the early 1990s when a
convention of Navy aviators, all liquored up, assaulted women in a
Las Vegas hotel? We also see the potential for this kind of extreme
male bonding at professional sporting events like 49er and Raider
football games. Juiced from too much booze and the excitement of
watching their gridiron heroes smashing into one another, men in
the stands scream their heads off and threaten all sorts of mayhem
on fans wearing the jerseys of the opposing team.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, the players themselves _ whether on the football
field, baseball diamond, hockey rink, or basketball court _ are
transformed into mobs.
</P>
<P>
   Boys just being boys.
</P>
<P>

columnist whose book, ``Yellow Journalist,'' will be published by
Temple University in February 2001.)

SEEING DRUGS AS A CHOICE OR AS A BRAIN ANOMALY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Michael Massing is the author of ``The Fix,'' a study of drug
policy in the United States since the 1960s.) 
 By MICHAEL MASSING   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Alan I. Leshner, the director of the National Institute on
Drug Abuse, a division of the National Institutes of Health, is
known for his slide shows. Two or three times a week he gives a
speech _ to treatment counselors and prevention specialists,
physicians and policy-makers _ and almost all feature slides culled
from the work of the 1,200 researchers supported by his institute.
</P>
<P>
   The slides are of brain scans, and they usually come in pairs.
The ``before'' slides show the activity of a normal brain; the
``after'' ones depict a brain that has had prolonged exposure to
drugs. Lacing his presentation with jokes and Yiddish expressions _
as a youth, Leshner summered at a Catskills hotel owned by his
grandparents, and he has a bit of Alan King in him _ he tries to
translate the science into plain English.
</P>
<P>
   What the science shows, he says, is that the brain of an addict
is fundamentally different from that of a nonaddict. Initially,
when a person uses hard drugs like heroin or cocaine, the chemistry
of the brain is not much affected, and the decision to take the
drugs remains voluntary. But at a certain point, he says, a
``metaphorical switch in the brain'' gets thrown, and the
individual moves into a state of addiction characterized by
compulsive drug use. These brain changes, Leshner says, persist
long after addicts stop using drugs, which is why, he continues,
relapse is so common. Addiction, Leshner declares, should be
approached more like other chronic illnesses, like diabetes and
hypertension. Going further, he says that drugs so alter the brain
that addiction can be compared to mental disorders like Alzheimer's
disease and schizophrenia. It is, he says, a ``brain disease.''
</P>
<P>
   In promoting this concept, Leshner has stepped forthrightly into
a debate that has smoldered for decades: Are drug addicts
responsible for their behavior? Should they be treated as sick
people in need of help, or as bad people in need of punishment?
Leshner has come down squarely on the side of illness. And he is
winning many people over. Today the brain-disease model is widely
accepted in the addiction field, and Barry R. McCaffrey, the White
House drug adviser, routinely invokes it.
</P>
<P>
   Others are not convinced. ``I reject the notion that addicts
fall under the spell of drugs and become a zombie and so are not
responsible for anything they do,'' says Dr. Sally L. Satel, a
senior associate at the Ethics and Public Policy Center in
Washington and a practicing psychiatrist at a methadone clinic. To
her and other critics, the brain-disease model is a new orthodoxy
based less on science than on a desire to soften the stigma
attached to addiction.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that addiction is a disease is not new. In the 1960s
Alcoholics Anonymous began speaking of alcoholism as a disease.
But, initially at least, AA used the term figuratively to suggest
the tenacious hold drinking has on alcoholics. Over the last decade
or so, however, advances in brain-imaging technology have allowed
researchers to measure the impact of psychoactive substances on the
brain with increasing precision. Investigators have found that
drugs like cocaine, heroin and alcohol increase the brain's
production of dopamine, the neurotransmitter that regulates
pleasure, among other things. This helps account for the euphoric
high drug users feel. But these drugs deplete the dopamine pathway,
disrupting the individual's ability to function.
</P>
<P>
   At the Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island, for
instance, Dr. Nora D. Volkow has found that even 100 days after a
cocaine addict's last dose, there is significant disruption in the
brain's frontal cortical area, which governs such attributes as
impulse, motivation and drive. Volkow says that ``the disruption of
the dopamine pathways leads to a decrease in the reinforcing value
of normal things, and this pushes the individual to take drugs to
compensate.''
</P>
<P>
   Other researchers have found a physiological basis for the
craving so many addicts experience, but it is not yet clear how
long such physiological changes remain.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Herbert D. Kleber, the medical director of the National
Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse in New York, says that the
brain-disease concept fits with his experience with thousands of
addicts over the years. ``No one wants to be an addict,'' he says.
``All anyone wants to be able to do is knock back a few drinks with
the guys on Friday or have a cigarette with coffee or take a toke
on a crack pipe. But very few addicts can do this. When someone
goes from being able to control their habit to mugging their
grandmother to get money for their next fix, that convinces me that
something has changed in their brain.''
</P>
<P>
   But does causing changes in the brain qualify addiction as a
brain disease? Not according to Dr. Gene M. Heyman, a lecturer at
the Harvard Medical School and a research psychologist at McLean
Hospital in Boston. ``Since we can visualize the brain of someone
who's craving, people say, `Ah hah, addiction is a brain
disease,''' he remarks. ``But when someone sees a McDonald's
hamburger, things are going on in the brain, too, but that doesn't
tell you whether their behavior is involuntary or not.''
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging that addiction does induce compulsive
behavior, Heyman says that addicts still retain a degree of
volition, as evidenced by the many who stop using drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smoking meets the criteria for addiction, but 50 percent of
smokers have quit,'' he says. This change, he goes on, is
``demonstrably related'' to the data about the hazards of smoking
that have emerged since the surgeon general's report on the subject
in 1964. By contrast, Heyman says, ``information about
schizophrenia hasn't reduced the frequency of that illness.''
</P>
<P>
   Heyman also cites a well-known study of Vietnam veterans who
were dependent on heroin while overseas. Within three years of
their return to the United States, the study found, nearly 90
percent were no longer using it _ strong evidence, Heyman says,
that the addictive state is not permanent.
</P>
<P>
   Sally Satel first became skeptical about the brain-disease model
in 1997, when she attended a conference of the drug-abuse institute
on the medical treatment of heroin addiction. ``So pervasive was
the idea that a dysfunctional brain is the root of addiction that I
was able to sit through the entire two-and-a-half-day meeting
without once hearing such words as `responsibility,' 'choice,'
'character' _ the vocabulary of personhood,'' Satel wrote in a
paper called ``Is Drug Addiction a Brain Disease?''
</P>
<P>
   Written with Dr. Frederick K. Goodwin and published as a booklet
by the Ethics and Public Policy Center, the paper offers a
blistering attack on the drug-abuse institute and its brain-disease
terminology. ``Dramatic visuals are seductive and lend scientific
credibility to NIDA's position,'' the paper states, but politicians
``should resist this medicalized portrait for at least two reasons.
</P>
<P>
   First, it appears to reduce a complex human activity to a slice
of damaged brain tissue. Second, and most important, it vastly
underplays the reality that much of addictive behavior is
voluntary.''
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   To support that claim, Satel cited the results of the
Epidemiologic Catchment Area study, paid for by the National
Institute of Mental Health, which asked 20,300 adults about their
psychological history. Of the 1,300 people who were found to have
been dependent on or abusing drugs, 59 percent said they had not
been users for at least a year before the interview; the average
time of remission was 2.7 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that many, perhaps most addicts are in control of
their actions and appetites for circumscribed periods of time shows
that they are not perpetually helpless victims of a chronic
disease,'' Satel said.
</P>
<P>
   At the mention of Satel, Leshner bristles. ``Simplistic and
polarizing,'' he says of her writing. More generally, Leshner
maintains that his views have been distorted and misinterpreted.
Still, he says, he has lately modified his message, giving more
recognition to the role of volition in addiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's version,'' he says, is that addiction is ``a brain
disease expressed as compulsive behavior; both its development and
the recovery from it depend on the individual's behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Where does choice end and compulsion begin? The slide showing
that has not yet appeared.

 &HT;    Wimberley's resident movie star
 &HT;    By Chris Garcia
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ His mouth stretches wide, the lips contorting
slightly sideways, tiny teeth exposed. His small hand _ the one
with the big Band-Aid on its thumb _ moves to cover the hole, but
the gesture is in vain. Bryan Chafin, Hollywood actor, Nintendo fan
and French fries lover, is yawning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry, I'm not a morning person,'' he says, the gaping mouth
shrinking into a little boy's smile.
</P>
<P>
   It's 10:30 in the morning, but Bryan's mom, Juli, woke him up at
8 so they could be out of their Wimberley home by 9 and be here, in
Austin, on time for an interview with a journalist. I commiserate
with the boy by yawning, and our fraternity of fatigue is sealed.
</P>
<P>
   The kid's a movie star. Bryan, an 11-year-old Texas native,
co-stars in Mel Gibson's new film ``The Patriot,'' which opens
nationwide Wednesday. Directed by ``Independence Day'' and
``Godzilla'' helmer Roland Emmerich and written by ``Saving Private
Ryan's'' Robert Rodat, the nearly three-hour movie is a surefire
summer smash, spilling with pulse-quickening battle scenes, moist
family melodrama and oodles of patriotic hokum.
</P>
<P>
   Set during the American Revolution in 1776, it tells the story
of devout family man and war hero Benjamin Martin, played by
Gibson, who takes up arms against the English when his family's
safety is threatened. Bryan, bedecked in a ponytail and
button-laden Colonial attire, plays one of Gibson's four sons,
Samuel Martin. Bryan gets 19th billing in a credited cast of 61.
His character is listed before Gen. George Washington.
</P>
<P>
   This is Bryan's first major film after a passel of commercials
and independent movies made in Central Texas. He doesn't look like
a movie star. He looks like a good kid _ elfin face, freckly nose,
sandy hair and a precocious grin _ who might ruffle his parents on
occasion but gets stellar grades and loves sports.
</P>
<P>
   Child stars can be a pain. Just ask W.C. Fields. Or me. The
hellion who played the young Darth Vader in ``The Phantom Menace,''
for example, cut a swath of bratty petulance through the nation's
press corps. Few reported his inflated sense of entitlement, saucy
attitude and smarty-pants answers. We know now why the Dark Side
embraced this chosen boy.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Bryan, a child actor so far immune to Hollywood's
character-ravaging afflictions. He is nothing if not humble and
polite. He is self-conscious, self-effacing. He apologizes when he
yawns. He signs an autograph with ``Best wishes. Stay cool.'' You
just want to tousle his hair.
</P>
<P>
   If he's capable of giving the kind of kid answers journalists
dread (Why are you drawn to acting? ``It's just what I like to
do.'' Yes, but . . . ), Bryan is bitten by the kind of enthusiasm
that helps us tell our stories.
</P>
<P>
   Watch, and follow if you can, as he animatedly relates how he
wrote and directed a scene from a Harry Potter book for school, for
which he got an A+ and extra credit, or how he signed an autograph
at Burger King and . . . well, I couldn't follow that story.
</P>
<P>
   So back to the ``why acting'' question, which requires we first
investigate the Band-Aid on his thumb. Bryan sliced the digit with
a knife when he was whittling. His brother Blake, 16, is an
apprentice wood carver. ``I kind of like to copy my brother a
lot,'' says Bryan.
</P>
<P>
   Blake also acts in community theater. ``That's kind of how I got
into acting,'' says Bryan. ``I tagged along with him. He's more of
a theater actor than a film actor, but he's pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Bryan is in a Mel Gibson movie and Blake is carving lumber.
``What he thinks of my movie is kind of bittersweet, because like
he's proud of me but he got me into acting and he's kind of like,
'Man, that should be me.' But he's not mad,'' Bryan says.
</P>
<P>
   It's odd because Bryan hasn't seen ``The Patriot'' and I have.
They will see it Tuesday at the Hollywood premiere. He and mom want
to know how much screen time he has and if his 11 lines made the
cut. I tell him about a decapitation by cannonball in a battle
scene and he squeals, ``Oh, cool! Cool!''
</P>
<P>
   Bryan's character doesn't do much, but he does kill a man. One
shot from a musket and down goes the Redcoat. He went through a
week of musket training for that scene. ``First you put the musket
on half-cock so it can't go off, then you open the wick-pan, then
tear open the powder packet and pour it in,'' he recites. ``I got
to where I could fire three shots in a minute.''
</P>
<P>
   How did mom react to her 11-year-old killing? ``He was shooting
at nobody,'' she responds. This cool equipoise earned Juli respect
on the set in South Carolina. ``I was voted `most not like a stage
mom' by the hair dressers,'' she laughs.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan also cries in the film. His trick: He thinks about his pet
cat Kato, who was run over by a car.
</P>
<P>
   On the first day of shooting, last fall, Bryan was ``a little
shaky.'' But the crushing tedium of movie-making soon numbed the
nerves. ``It's pretty much hurry up and wait the whole time,'' he
says, using an old Hollywood axiom. He played a lot of Nintendo in
his trailer with co-star Heath Ledger, who plays Gibson's eldest
son.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson, he says, ``was nice.'' Mom elaborates that Gibson
indulged in his well-noted set shenanigans and that Bryan gave the
Three Stooges fanatic a couple of Stooges toys to the actor's
delight.
</P>
<P>
   When the family is in Los Angeles over the next few days, Bryan
will meet with film people about prospective projects. Recently he
was one of three children considered for the big-budget action
movie ``Pearl Harbor'' as well as the upcoming Bruce Willis
project. He didn't get the roles.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bryan received his first fan letter, which mom has
put in a photo album. It's from a young Canadian girl, who wrote,
``You're a very sympathetic and talented young actor. . . . You're
so natural and you always bring something so positive and so
refreshing in all you do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That makes me feel good,'' says Bryan, ``because if I can get
one I'm sure there's going to be more coming in.''

   ZIMBABWE-ELECTIONS (Harare, Zimbabwe) _ The old heroes sing
liberation songs and predict an overwhelming victory for President
Robert Mugabe and his ruling party. But 200 miles south of the
capital here, in the poor, rural villages near Chivi, the ruling
party's local youth leader, Ocean Mudzivi, smells change in the
air. This weekend, Zimbabweans will vote in parliamentary elections
that will challenge the overwhelming dominance of Mugabe's ruling
party for the first time in this nation's 20 years of independence.
And as Mugabe campaigned across the country Friday, he urged people
to remember the past and to stay true to the party that liberated
them from white rule. But the old message is landing in the ears of
a changing nation. By Rachel Swarns.

   GORE-FUNDRAISING (Washington) _ Vice President Al Gore said he
will make public the full transcript of his ``cooperative and
professional'' interview with a prosecutor who has called for a
special inquiry into Gore's veracity about his 1996 fund raising.
``I think the truth is my friend in this,'' Gore told reporters
Friday on his presidential campaign plane. The vice president said
he would release the 150-page interview because ``I want people to
judge for themselves'' and ``I want the truth to be known about
this.'' The supervising attorney for the Justice Department's
campaign finance task force, Robert Conrad, has suggested that a
special counsel should be appointed to investigate Gore's
statements in the interview. The recommendation for Attorney
General Janet Reno was made weeks ago, after the prosecutor
questioned Gore on April 18 about a Buddhist temple fund-raising
event Gore attended, as well as other topics. (Summary from wires)

&HT;     DISCOVERING A HAVEN FOR GULF COAST REDFISH 
</HEADLINE>

   ARANSAS PASS, Texas _ Rats to bulls, there's nothing like
redfish fishing on the flats in the summertime.
</P>
<P>
   The bronzed and brawny heavyweights spend the first years of
life cruising the shallow bay waters, rooting crabs from the sea
grass, smacking gold spoons, popping leaders, breaking hearts.
</P>
<P>
   Early in life, redfish are called rats, or rat-reds. The name is
not derogatory. Rather, it denotes fish under the 20-inch minimum
legal possession length set by the state. Any redfish too small to
be kept legally is a rat.
</P>
<P>
   Rats are the spookiest members of the redfish clan. They travel
in large schools and are the first to move up on the flats with a
rising tide. Even though they are small in size, they still put up
a good fight.
</P>
<P>
   Wade fishermen who encounter a school of rat reds should watch
the movement of the school and cast so the fish move to the bait.
Casting directly to a fish within the school can spook the entire
school.
</P>
<P>
   When a rat is hooked, try to guide it away from the school for
the fight, and, if possible, keep it from splashing and thrashing.
It is possible to catch more than one red from the school if care
is taken, and learning the skills to work a school of small redfish
is a measure of the accomplished angler.
</P>
<P>
   When the targets get larger and more solitary in nature, the
positioning of a lure and the ability to control part of the battle
to hand enhance the quality of the fishing experience.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the fish ruler are large reds, 36 inches and
longer. They are known as bulls. The term ``bull red'' is not
gender-specific. Both male and female reds can be called ``bulls''
if they are big.
</P>
<P>
   Bull reds are uncommon in bays, but they are there. Big redfish
are creatures of the open Gulf waters and come close to shore only
during the spawning period from October into January.
</P>
<P>
   Between the rats and the bulls in size are the fish most sport
anglers bring to the dock in the summer. Generically, they are
called keepers. In Texas, the daily bag limit is three redfish
between 20 and 28 inches long. Most of those fish weigh from 4 to 7
pounds and are less than 4 years old.
</P>
<P>
   A redfish longer than 28 inches can be kept if the angler tags
it with the bonus tag that comes with a fishing license.
</P>
<P>
   In the last week of July and well into August, tides drop to the
lowest levels of the summer, and the redfish are pushed off the
flats into the deeper pockets, or holes, in the bay systems. The
phenomenon of thousands of redfish of all sizes ganged up in bay
pockets is called a ``rodeo.''
</P>
<P>
   When a redfish rodeo is on, it is not uncommon to see dozens of
boats anchored up in large circles around the holes with hundreds
of lines cast toward the middle. The fishing is fast and furious
and the catching can be non-stop.
</P>
<P>
   Fishing a redfish rodeo is a low-tech event. Fresh-cut mullet,
piggy perch or shrimp are good baits. Get a medium-heavy rod, some
17-pound test line and a reel with a good drag.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, a chunk of bait on a 3/0 hook is enough weight for
casting into the school. A half-ounce barrel sinker above a swivel
tied onto an 18-inch leader should be adequate to cast a bait into
the wind.
</P>
<P>
   A rodeo is not the place for a light-tackle fish fight. The idea
is to get the fish to the boat and into the ice chest while causing
as few tangles as possible with other lines.
</P>
<P>
   On an August low tide, plan to be at or near such places as
California Hole in the Estes Flats area.
</P>
<P>
   Look for boats positioned in a large circle, and move into place
very quietly. Even rodeo reds can be spooked out of a hole, and if
it's your fault for spooking them, you won't be a popular cowboy.

   NEW YORK _ There is intense concern in certain lofty altitudes
of Manhattan's Upper East Side. The Carlyle Hotel is for sale, and
the seriously soigne are worried that this oasis of sophistication
_ the preserve of presidents, prime ministers and popular legends _
will fall into, well, the wrong hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many guests come up to me and say, `I hope they don't
change things,''' said Ronald Hector, standing behind the reception
desk in his role as executive assistant manager. ``They all know
about the sale, and they are all worried.''
</P>
<P>
   Annexation by a boorish newcomer ``would be such a shame,'' said
Brooke Astor, the 98-year-old society cynosure who celebrated her
95th birthday at the Carlyle. ``I would feel so sad if it were no
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, it would be ``terrible'' if the Carlyle were sold ``to
anyone who didn't respect its inherent characteristics,'' said
Woody Allen, the filmmaker and sometime Carlyle guest who plays
jazz clarinet in the Cafe Carlyle nearly every Monday night.
``There are certain things that are just better left alone, and the
Carlyle is one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   The 70-year-old hotel has long been a palace of secrets, well
before it became the New York White House for President Kennedy,
who made it a fulcrum of world _ and possibly other _ affairs. It
is the grand residence where Diana, princess of Wales, discreetly
stayed whenever she visited New York, and it is where John F.
Kennedy Jr. last ate breakfast before his plane crashed.
</P>
<P>
   In true Carlylish tradition, the parties to the sale have been
exquisitely private about hawking the property, and few reliable
details have leaked about the complex negotiations that have now
dragged on for more than a year. In an interview, Norman L. Peck,
the managing partner of the Carlyle, who heads its ownership group,
said he would not think of permitting an unqualified suitor to buy
``this very high-bred animal.''
</P>
<P>
   The sale comes as the occupancy rate in the city's 60,000 hotel
rooms is the highest in 20 years: 89.1 percent in April, according
to estimates by PricewaterhouseCoopers, the accounting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Average room rates citywide are $245.27, 11.7 percent higher
than a year before, but hardly in a league with the Carlyle. Its
cushy, antique-rich rooms go for $425 to $695 per night for a
single; suites range from $650 to $3,250.
</P>
<P>
   The opulent Carlyle is perhaps best known for the presence of
Bobby Short, the high-end saloon singer who has served up Cole
Porter and George Gershwin at the Cafe Carlyle since 1968.
</P>
<P>
   But habitues say they adore the state-of-the-art cosseting by
the work force of 437. Above and beyond the staff's paparazzi
protection, ``there seems to be a cone of privacy around
celebrities at the hotel,'' said Charles Dean, a restaurant captain
and the assistant maitre d'hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Discretion is so cherished that soon after the breakup of the
Beatles, two of them were guests in the hotel in different suites
at the same time but did not realize it until after they had left,
according to employees who were there. Even now, they will not say
which Beatles they were.
</P>
<P>
   The Carlyle prospectus was sent to a select group of several
dozen potential buyers ``because we didn't want to see a hotel like
this involved in a marketing process like a common commercial
property,'' said the Carlyle's broker, Benjamin V. Lambert of
Eastdil Realty in Manhattan. But word spread, and soon more than 50
bidders were clamoring to kick the tires.
</P>
<P>
   The intense secrecy imposed by the Carlyle has forced the
customarily gab-happy real estate clan to clutch at gossipy straws;
parties to the negotiations have refused to name names. In
December, a tabloid newspaper reported that the Carlyle was to be
bought by the sultan of Brunei for $150 million, but several
parties close to the deal, including Peck, emphatically deny it.
</P>
<P>
   It is likely that the Carlyle will be sold as a trophy property
to ``a strong foreign hotel company that is looking to enhance its
visibility throughout the world,'' said Sean Hennessey, director of
the hotel-consulting business of PricewaterhouseCoopers.

 &HT;    UNITED PLANS CHALLENGE TO DELTA IN SOUTHEAST AFTER ITS MERGER

   WASHINGTON _ The head of United Airlines said Friday that if its
merger with US Airways goes through, the company plans to expand
its Charlotte, N.C., hub and challenge Delta Air Lines for
supremacy in the Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Delta, with its hub in Atlanta, is the largest airline in the
Southeast, and it has a strong presence there,'' United Chairman
James E. Goodwin told the House Judiciary Committee. ``But we plan
to expand our newly acquired hub in Charlotte and directly compete
with Delta along routes in the South.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodwin said the $11.6 billion merger would strengthen United's
minimal presence on north-south routes along the East Coast and on
transcontinental flights across the southern tier of the United
States, because U.S. Airways is strong in those areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The merger will allow United to directly challenge Delta's
presence in the Southeast,'' Goodwin said. ``It also makes it more
economical for cross-country flights, and we plan to expand our
routes with new non-stop service from Charlotte to Austin, San
Antonio and Portland, Oregon, as well as additional nonstop flights
to Denver, Seattle and San Francisco.''
</P>
<P>
   Steven Wolf, chairman of US Airways, said United also plans new
direct or one-stop flights from Charlotte to major cities in
Europe, Asia and South America.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing was called to examine both the lack of airline
competition at hub airports and the United-U.S. Airways merger.
Although federal regulators, not Congress, must decide whether to
approve or reject the merger, political sentiment can influence
their decision.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf told the committee that hub airports do not encourage
anti-competitive practices, but instead foster competition from
other airlines. He said that hub airports offer customers more
choices and provide service to more cities than would be possible
without the hub-and-spoke system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hub airports compete with other hub airports,'' Wolf said.
``We are competing with Delta in the Southeast by providing our
Charlotte hub with a stronger platform to help it grow and compete
with Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   Committee Chairman Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., said the hub system
and the lack of airport capacity has lead to an absence of
competition at hub airports.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have long been concerned about airline competition at hub
airports,'' Hyde said. ``I was particularly impressed by the
testimony at last week's hearing from AirTran, a low-cost carrier
flying out of Atlanta. AirTran is anxious to compete in a number of
markets, but it cannot get sufficient access to airports, which is
similar to complaints that we have heard in the past from other
low-cost carriers.''

READY FOR FENCES TO FALL IN EUROPE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, June 25)  
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It sounds a little weird, but the Old World is a work in
progress.
</P>
<P>
   Europe is in the throes of change, and investors there are only
beginning to benefit from the Eurocentric capital markets system
that is being built.
</P>
<P>
   Later this summer, for example, the European Commission is
likely to give pension funds in member countries the green light to
make cross-border investments. Collectively, those funds have $2
trillion in assets.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is old news to American money managers, who have
spent the last couple of years anticipating what these changes will
mean and how to profit from them.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Levy, head of international equities at Deutsche Asset
Management and manager of the Deutsche European Equity fund, took
some time last week to talk about those and other issues. Following
are excerpts from the conversation: &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q. Changes related to pension funds will increase the amount of
cross-border investing in Europe. How are you positioning your fund
to benefit from that? &QL; 
 &QL; 
A. We looked at the way these markets appeared from the point of
view of the managers in each country, and asked what their asset
allocation was. The answer was that it was incredibly distorted.
Spanish fund managers, for example, were pretty much captive to
Spanish stocks, which are dominated by utilities and banks.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have been freed from those constraints have been
moving into large companies outside their home country, names like
LVMH, Total Fina Elf, Mannesmann and Nokia. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q. Aren't many European funds underweighted in stocks? &QL; 
 &QL; 
A. By our standards, the exposure to equities is low.
</P>
<P>
   As pension funds become funded, instead of pay-as-you-go, we are
going to see an increasing shift from bonds to equities. That is
going to happen over the next 5 to 10 years, and is going to
generate tremendous demand for stock in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   I have seen conservative estimates that project institutional
demand for European equities to be $11 trillion between now and
2010. That is a big number, and it doesn't make any wild
assumptions about equities. The demand will outstrip supply, and
there will be more supply. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q. So do you expect to see a lot more companies go public? &QL; 
 &QL; 
A. For the first time, a lot of companies are going to start coming
to market. Companies will have the chance to raise capital in many
more markets, and investors will have the choice of which ones they
want to invest in.
</P>
<P>
   Before now, pension funds and companies were basically captive.
Except for the best-rated companies, who could float debt in the
Eurobond market, there has not been a capital market in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds rated ``A'' or below account for about 93 percent of the
American corporate bond market. In Europe, it is almost the
reverse. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q. Has your fund invested in any newly created companies?  &QL; 
 &QL; 
A. Early in the year, we positioned ourselves to invest in a number
of spinoffs, including two from Siemens, Infineon and Epcos.
</P>
<P>
   And we have invested in companies like Reckitt Benckiser, a
British company that has been taken over by Benckiser, a very
successful Dutch family-owned concern.  &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q. What are some of your other holdings? &QL; 
 &QL; 
A. Vodafone AirTouch is a large position, even though we are
underweight the United Kingdom. At the start of the year, we held a
number of blue chips like Philips, Siemens, Telefonica and Nokia.
We own companies like Intershop, a German software company, and
Total Fina Elf has been very exciting, and is one of our largest
positions. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q. Does the move to create one European market with a common
currency mean the Continent is less vulnerable to swings in the
American business cycle? &QL; 
 &QL; 
A. There is no way Europe or anywhere else would not be impacted by
a recession here. However, the euro zone does about 90 percent of
its trading within the European Union itself. So they are about as
closed a market as the U.S. is.
</P>
<P>
   A recession would create some spillover, but not as great as in
the past. And if the U.S. is able to pull off a soft landing, there
would be practically no effect. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q. Do European markets represent a good opportunity for American
investors? &QL; 
A. Some of the markets are doing better than others. France and
Sweden are doing all right. The United Kingdom has had a hard time,
because sterling was too strong.
</P>
<P>
   That said, there is no question this is a great time to get in.
Whether or not the euro has another bout of weakness, it is an
oversold, undervalued currency.
</P>
<P>
   The weaker euro gives dollar investors a nice window and
provides a nice tailwind for European economies and countries to
restructure.  &QL;

 &HT;    PARENTS AREN'T MONITORING KIDS MULTI-MEDIA USE, STUDIES SHOW
 &HT;    For Use Mon. June 26 And Thereafter.
 &HT;    DUPLICATION ALERT: Moving in (w) Washington and (l) Lifestyle
categories

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Growing up in America is rapidly becoming a wired
experience but parents aren't plugged in to their kids' multi-media
habits, according to a trio of scholarly reports to be released on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The three studies by Annenberg Public Policy Center of the
University of Pennsylvania found that almost half of all families
with children aged 2 to 17 have a television, a VCR, a computer and
a video game player. More of these families subscribe to an
Internet access service than to a daily newspaper. They average
nearly three TV sets per household.
</P>
<P>
   The typical adolescent's bedroom is equipped with almost enough
gadgetry to stock an electronics store. Most children aged 8 to 16
have a television in their bedrooms. Three out of four have a
stereo or CD player; 39 percent can play video games there; 32
percent have a bedroom phone and 20 percent have a bedroom
computer.
</P>
<P>
   Parents estimate that their children spend four and a half hours
per day staring at some sort of video screen, according to the
surveys. However, parents are more concerned about what the kids
are seeing than about how much time is being spent with electronic
media.
</P>
<P>
   While 85 percent of parents worry about what their children
watch on TV, only 40 percent have sets equipped with V-Chips or
other blocking technology. And only about half of those with these
devices actually use them to regulate family viewing. The
percentage of parents who are familiar with the rating guidelines
for TV shows has declined from 70 percent in 1997 to 50 percent in
2000, the surveys found.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have these difficulties helping parents guide their
children's television use, imagine the problems we will have with
new media technologies entering the home,'' warned Emory Woodard, a
researcher for the Annenberg Public Policy Center, an academic
group that studies the role of communications in public policy
issues.
</P>
<P>
   The three studies _ ``Media in the Home 2000,'' ``Is the
Three-Hour Rule Living Up to Its Potential?'' and ``Public Policy,
Family Rules and Children's Media Use in the Home'' _ examine how
families use and regard media.
</P>
<P>
   ``Media in the Home 2000'' is based on telephone interviews with
1,235 randomly selected parents of children between the ages of 2
and 17 and 416 children between the ages of 8 and 16. The margin of
error in the parental survey was plus or minus 2.9 percent and was
plus or minus 5 percent for the interviews with children.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Three Hour Rule'' report analyzes educational programming
on 10 commercial TV stations in Philadelphia during the 1999/2000
season. The ``Family Rules'' report is based on 24 focus group
discussions with 87 children and 62 mothers of children in grades
3, 6 and 9.
</P>
<P>
   The studies found a remarkable media presence into American
homes.
</P>
<P>
   For families with children aged 2 to 17, 97 percent have a VCR
in their home, 70 percent have a computer, 68 percent have video
game players, 52 percent have online access and 42 percent have a
newspaper subscription. In four years, the number of these
households with Internet access has more than tripled from 15
percent in 1996 to 52 percent in 2000. These families with children
have an average of 2.8 TV sets per household and 78 percent
subscribe to at least basic cable.
</P>
<P>
   Low-income families (less than $30,000 annual income) are less
likely to have computers, Internet access or newspaper
subscriptions. However, they are equally likely to have a video
game player and their children are more likely to have TV sets in
their bedrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Family income is an inverse indicator of media use _ children
from high-income families spend the least amount of time with media
and children from low-income families spend the most time with
media.
</P>
<P>
   Of the media surveyed, children spent the most time watching TV
(147 minutes per day) and the least on the Internet (14 minutes per
day).
</P>
<P>
   Most parents (88 percent) told the survey that they regularly
supervise their children's TV viewing. About half said they do so
with their kids' use of the Internet or video games.
</P>
<P>
   The studies indicated that most parents aren't using the systems
set up to help them guide their children's TV habits.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Since 1997, local broadcast stations have aired a minimum of
three hours per week of educational programming in order to qualify
for expedited renewal of licenses granted by the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC). These programs must be labeled as
educational and informative _ E/I. But most parents were unable to
identify the E/I programs watched by their children. Indeed, 70
percent of the parents incorrectly picked ``The Oprah Winfrey
Show'' and ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?'' as labeled E/I for
children.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Telecommunications Act of 1996, new televisions are
required to contain a computer chip _ V-chip _ that allows parents
to block out programs with certain ratings. Most networks are
voluntarily rating their programs _ TV-Y as suitable for all
children, for example.
</P>
<P>
   However, the studies showed that the system is not yet widely
used. Only about one in five families uses a blocking device
although twice that many have the technology to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``The V-chip ratings and the Three-Hour rule are not living up
to their potential,'' said Amy Jordan, a senior researcher for the
Annenberg Public Policy Center. ``Most TV programs now have ratings
and many families have blocking technology. There is also more
educational programming out there for families. But parents are not
using these tools to guide their children's television use.''
</P>
<P>
   The reports and their implications will be discussed Monday at
the Annenberg Center's 5th Annual Conference on Children and the
Media to be held in Washington, D.C. The Center was established by
publisher and philanthropist Walter Annenberg in 1994 to create a
community of scholars within the University of Pennsylvania.

ADVERTISING: ENTERTAINMENT MARKETERS FORM NEW ALLIANCES 
</HEADLINE>
   By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Big changes are coming to the small but intensely
competitive world of agencies that specialize in creating
theatrical advertising.
</P>
<P>
   G-Whiz Entertainment in New York, a unit of Grey Global Group,
is getting out of the business of producing campaigns for Broadway
and off-Broadway shows to concentrate on larger assignments in
entertainment marketing. And Wilner Advertising in New York, a
Broadway show specialist, is closing.
</P>
<P>
   The changes come as efforts to sell tickets to live theater grow
in complexity and scope, while it becomes increasingly challenging
to gain the attention of consumers in an environment saturated with
entertainment options that range from new reality series on
television to a glitzed-up revival of professional wrestling to
so-called extreme sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``The theater business itself has never been better, but it's
very labor-intensive,'' said Nancy Coyne, chairwoman at Serino
Coyne Inc. in New York, which handles shows like ``Aida,'' ``Beauty
and the Beast,'' ``Cats,'' ``Footloose,'' ``Kiss Me, Kate'' and
``The Lion King.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to make a go of it unless you have a lot of
clients,'' she added. ``With one or two, it's hard to do.''
</P>
<P>
   G-Whiz Entertainment is forming an alliance with Eliran Murphy
Group in New York, which specializes in theatrical advertising, to
serve the needs of producers of plays and musicals whose accounts
had been handled by G-Whiz Entertainment. Those billings were
estimated at $3.5 million out of a total of $110 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The formation of G-Whiz Entertainment resulted in a change in
our mission,'' said Barbara Martino, president and chief executive.
Her reference was to a move made in February by Grey Global,
formerly Grey Advertising, to merge two specialty units.
</P>
<P>
   That merger brought together G-Whiz, founded in July 1999, which
focused on marketing to children and teen-agers, with Grey
Entertainment, founded in 1974, which focused on traditional
entertainment campaigns like the promotion of shows on and
off-Broadway as well as films. Martino had been president at G-Whiz
before the merger that produced G-Whiz Entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The entertainment slant is becoming more of a youth-marketing
slant,'' Martino said. ``The Broadway effort pretty much did not
fit under where we were headed.''
</P>
<P>
   The shift in emphasis, she added, would benefit the
youth-focused clients of G-Whiz Entertainment like Aeropostale, a
retailer of apparel aimed at teen-agers; Delsner/Slater, concert
promoters; SFX Entertainment; the Warner Bros. unit of Time Warner;
and Youtopia.com, a Web site focused on teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   Eliran Murphy, an agency with 27 employees handling accounts
with billings estimated at $25 million, will assume the theatrical
accounts now handled by G-Whiz Entertainment, assuming of course
that clients agree to the switch. The shows affected include the
current production of the long-running revue ``Forbidden
Broadway,'' called ``Forbidden Broadway Cleans Up Its Act''; ``Late
Night Catechism''; the coming production of ``Little Women''; and
``Tony 'n Tina's Wedding.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hopeful they're interested in working with us,'' said
Barbara Eliran, chief executive at Eliran Murphy. Ann Murphy,
president and creative director, described the alliance as ``a
referral'' of the clients to Eliran Murphy.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The 10 employees at G-Whiz Entertainment who work on theatrical
advertising, out of a total of about 110, are to be interviewed for
positions at Eliran Murphy, which now works for productions like
``A Moon for the Misbegotten,'' ``Cabaret,'' ``Dame Edna,''
``Dinner with Friends'' and ``I Love You, You're Perfect, Now
Change,'' as well as the Brooklyn Museum of Art, the Manhattan
Theater Club, the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, the New York
City Opera and the Roundabout Theater Company.
</P>
<P>
   Turning to Wilner, its closing was described Thursday in
interviews with several top executives at other theatrical
agencies. Telephone calls to Jon Wilner, the president, were not
returned.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Wilner said he was owed over $500,000 by Livent Inc.,
the producer of the musical ``Ragtime,'' which his agency handled
until Livent filed for bankruptcy protection.
</P>
<P>
   The sole Broadway production now handled by Wilner is the
musical ``Saturday Night Fever.'' That show is shifting its account
to Serino Coyne, said Bill Evans, a spokesman, after receiving ``a
memo from Jon Wilner resigning the account.''

   In Japan, a culture where cremation is mandatory, a funeral
company is about to offer much more than the customary charred
bones: it is also offering grieving relatives a way of storing the
deceased's DNA in their memorial tablet.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the spread of genetic record cards for medical
treatments, our samples will help people complete their family's
DNA history,'' says Hideo Wakayama, a spokesman for funeral firm
Sekise of Nagoya.
</P>
<P>
   The DNA could also be useful in disputes over parentage and
claims to blood ties with the deceased, he adds. But one day the
sample could, in theory at least, be used to clone the dead _
although Japan is in the process of outlawing the cloning of
people.
</P>
<P>
   From July, for a charge of 120, Sekise will add a sealed capsule
containing a DNA sample to the ihai _ the lacquered wood Buddhist
memorial tablet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ihai is a sacred object,'' explained Wakayama. ``So it is
very suitable for keeping DNA samples over the generations.''
</P>
<P>
   Sekise's DNA preservation technology comes from Texas-based
Identigene, which has developed technology for making low-cost
permanent DNA samples. &QL;

   Traditional helicopters have a vertical tail rotor to stop the
main rotor from spinning the craft endlessly round and round. But
running that second rotor wastes around 8 percent of the chopper's
fuel, says Vladimir Savov, an expert in aerodynamics at the
Bulgarian Air Force Academy in Sofia. So to save that fuel, Savov
has invented the ``rotopter,'' a helicopter that flaps its rotors.
</P>
<P>
   Helicopters can already fly without tail rotors _ using
counter-rotating main rotors or elaborate fans on the tail boom _
but Savov has taken a different tack that he says will be far
cheaper. To fight the tendency of a helicopter to turn in the
opposite direction to its spinning rotor system, Savov has removed
the engine that spins the main rotors. Instead, flapping the rotors
up and down makes them spin of their own accord.
</P>
<P>
   Savov's design involves an engine driving a crank that creates
an up-and-down reciprocating motion that in turn drives two
separate rotor arms. By flapping the rotors up and down, and
carefully choosing the angle each rotor's aerofoil presents to the
air during its cycle, the rotors begins to rotate on their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no rotating moment transmitted to the rotopter rotor
blades, so there is no torque reaction _ and so no need for a tail
rotor,'' Savov said in a telephone interview from his home in
Pleven. ``The efficiency of the system could be comparable to that
of a standard helicopter,'' he claims.
</P>
<P>
   The downside of the idea is the distinctly odd _ and slightly
alarming _ vibrating motion of the rotors, which would probably
make for a very uncomfortable ride in a full-sized machine (see
video at www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/Runway/7551).
</P>
<P>
   ``This could be a big problem-I just don't know yet,'' says
Savov, who plans to undertake vibration isolation tests.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Westland Helicopters in Yeovil, Somerset, says:
``Savov's video shows it works, but it will take a lot more
modeling to prove it can actually move forwards and remain
stable.'' &QL;

   Imagine a rover that could make its way across the dull,
lifeless rocks and dust of the Moon, leaving behind it a trail of
solar cells capable of powering a Moon base. A group of NASA
researchers thinks it can be done.
</P>
<P>
   Power is always a problem in space, because energy sources such
as solar panels and nuclear reactors are heavy and expensive to
launch, and spacecraft have limited capacity. But, as luck would
have it, the Moon has everything that's needed to make solar
panels, according to Alex Freundlich, a physicist at the University
of Houston who is working on a fledgling project funded by the NASA
Institute for Advanced Concepts.
</P>
<P>
   The Moon has silicon, metals and other necessities in its rocks
_ and no atmosphere. The place is one big vacuum, much better than
those that can be created on Earth in microchip manufacturing
machines. The vacuum is critical, because it eliminates outside
forces that could push molecules off-track or cause contamination.
</P>
<P>
   Freundlich and his team are exploring the concept of a Moon
rover capable of building whole fields of solar cells. As the first
stage in this tentative scheme, a solar-powered rover would be sent
with enough raw materials to build solar cells that could generate
around 100 kilowatts of electricity.
</P>
<P>
   The manufacturing process would draw energy from a series of
lenses that concentrate the Sun's heat. A lens at the front of the
rover would melt regolith _ Moon dust _ to make a glass base for
the cells. The vehicle would then move forward and deposit a layer
of aluminum as an electrode on the new base. The metal would be
heated until its molecules began to evaporate, spraying through
nozzles under gravity.
</P>
<P>
   After laying down the aluminum, the rover would move forward
again and deposit the first layer of silicon, followed by a layer
of dopants _ the trace elements used in making semiconductors. When
all the necessary layers were applied, they would form solar cells
in which the active region was just a few micrometers thick.
</P>
<P>
   Freundlich says the cells would be less efficient than those
made on Earth because the materials would be of lower quality.
However, they would be free and unlimited once the system was in
place, so the benefits would far outweigh any disadvantages.
</P>
<P>
   The next stage would move towards full use of Moon resources. A
second spacecraft would deliver a ``robotic refinery,'' to be
powered by the solar cells, for extracting other substances from
Moon rocks.
</P>
<P>
   Freundlich hopes to have a prototype rover built within the next
few years and thinks that the first stage of the concept could be
realized within the decade. The team will also be looking at
whether they can modify the technology for use on Mars. &QL;

   A ``jumping gene'' being used to genetically engineer organisms
has crossed the species barrier at least seven times in
evolutionary history, in one instance between flies and humans,
according to a study commissioned by the British government. If
organisms modified using this mobile element are released, there
will be a risk of genes spreading to other species, the report
says.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called mariner element can move around in the genome of
individual species thanks to the transposase enzyme it encodes,
which ``cuts and pastes'' it from one place in a cell's DNA to
another. Such jumping genes litter most creatures' genomes. Their
ability to insert themselves into chromosomes makes them attractive
to genetic engineers as a means of moving genes from one species
into another.
</P>
<P>
   In a project for the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and
Food, Andy Brass and two colleagues at the University of Manchester
compared the DNA of 80,000 different organisms, using over five
million sequences. They found seven pairs of similar mariner
sequences. For instance, 83 percent of the sequence in the tsetse
fly Glossina palpalis, a bloodsucker that spreads human sleeping
sickness, was the same as a sequence in humans.
</P>
<P>
   Such a close match is strong suggestive evidence that mariner
has moved between tsetse flies and humans, Brass says. The transfer
occurred recently in evolutionary terms, he thinks, although it is
not clear whether mariner jumped from the fly to humans or vice
versa.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers also found close matches between the mariner
sequences in a tsetse fly and a mosquito, a bee and a blister
beetle, and a cat flea and a rusty grain beetle. This shows that,
while it's very rare, mariner can jump species. So if it is used to
insert genes into animals, these genes might spread into other
species.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might not be the smartest thing to use,'' Brass warns.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Hartl of Harvard University, who discovered mariner in the
1980s, agrees that caution is necessary, given that we know so
little about how mariner moves around. He is worried that if, for
example, it were used to insert an insecticide into a food crop, it
could spread the toxin to wild flowers and poison beneficial
insects such as bees.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to tread carefully,'' he says. ``You can't use it to
move genes by just making assumptions beforehand.''
</P>
<P>
   While no modified organisms created using mariner have reached
the market yet, several groups around the world are working with
it. Genetic engineers in the United States have demonstrated that
mariner can transfer an eye color gene from a fly into a mosquito,
while the Roslin Institute near Edinburgh has inserted mariner into
chickens, with the aim of getting them to produce pharmaceuticals
in their eggs.
</P>
<P>
   David Finnegan at the University of Edinburgh, who works with
the Roslin team, accepts that mariner might enable inserted genes
to jump species, but argues that it could be designed so that its
transposase only functioned for a short while.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can engineer things so that the risk is acceptably small,''
he says. &QL;

GETTING PAST AN AFFAIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ERICKA MELLON  
 c. 2000 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NOTE: PLEASE CORRECT BYLINE
</P>
<P>
   A love affair can be either a death knell or a wake-up call for
couples, Janis Abrahms Spring contends.
</P>
<P>
   Spring is an expert on infidelity. The Westport, Conn.,
psychologist wrote After the Affair: Healing the Pain and
Rebuilding Trust When a Partner Has Been Unfaithful (HarperCollins
1997) and gives lectures to her peers nationwide. She spoke
Thursday to counselors and psychologists in Lenexa and is appearing
today in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   In her book Spring emphasizes that ``after'' does not
necessarily mean the end. She tells couples dealing with an affair
``to step into the center of the ring, remove your boxing gloves
and join hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Many couples have this match to fight. Spring says one in every
2.7 couples in the United States is affected by an affair. And with
the increased popularity of the Internet, she says, virtual affairs
have become more common.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with The Star, she shares some of her insight.
</P>
<P>
   How do you define an affair?
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally an affair refers to the violation of sexual
exclusivity in a marriage. ... But this is a very narrow definition
because it refers only to sexual intercourse, only to married
couples, only to heterosexual couples. And affairs go way beyond
those dimensions. So I say that an affair is not necessarily about
sex but about secrets and a violation of trust.
</P>
<P>
   You write that it is possible for a relationship to survive an
affair. Does this belief surprise many people?
</P>
<P>
   Many people believe once the trust is broken, the relationship
is broken. But the truth is, we don't really know how we'd react to
something until it happens. Affairs happen to good people in good
relationships, too. The process of making sense of what went wrong
can be a growth process.
</P>
<P>
   How is it possible to survive?
</P>
<P>
   I have found that there are three essential ingredients to
healing.
</P>
<P>
   (First), unfaithful partners have to be willing to apologize
generously and often, to understand the harm they've caused. The
second essential ingredient is unfaithful partners have to be
willing to look deeply within themselves and understand why they
strayed so it never happens again. Third, unfaithful partners have
to be willing to earn back trust.
</P>
<P>
   Trust is not a cheap gift. It's something the unfaithful person
earns. And how do they earn it? By doing little things everyday
that make the hurt partner feel loved and safe.
</P>
<P>
   How have the Internet and chat rooms complicated the picture?
</P>
<P>
   Because the Internet is so accessible, anonymous and cheap,
people use it easily, secretly and they don't tend to see it as a
violation of the relationship. In reality, people are spending
hours talking graphically and pornographically to people they'll
not only never touch, but also never see.
</P>
<P>
   But when their partner finds out, they experience a very
profound shattering and violation because affairs are about
secrets. Plus, all the energy is going into these cybersex
relationships. The life of the marital relationship is drained.
</P>
<P>
   What advice can you give couples so that one partner doesn't
stray?
</P>
<P>
   The greatest antidote is when partners take responsibility for
their personal issues.
</P>
<P>
   If in your early years you were abandoned or abused, you may
grow up not feeling safe in relationships. You cannot trust people
fully and cannot love fully, and you go in search of one partner
after another. Or it could be you weren't valued as a child. These
vulnerabilities often are underlying the attraction to another
person.
</P>
<P>
   The second piece of advice is never take your partner for
granted and understand how relationships need to be nourished
everyday.
</P>
<P>
   When is it not right to stay together after an affair?
</P>
<P>
   When people ask me, ``What's my success rate,'' I say I don't
base my success on whether partners stay together but whether they
make a thoughtful decision about that.
</P>
<P>
   For some people it's better to get out. For other people, they
need help staying in and not leaving the relationship. I'm not for
preserving the relationship at any cost.  &LR; tag1:To reach Ericka

<TEXT>
<P>
   EUGENE, Ore. _ With the temperature of the track season about to
go from lukewarm to lava-hot, it says here that:
</P>
<P>
   Marion Jones will not win five gold medals at the Sydney
Olympics. In fact, she won't even win four.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Johnson will smoke Maurice Greene when _ or rather, if _
the two finally meet at 200 meters in the Olympic trials next month
in Sacramento. And he'll do the same two months later in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, Johnson and Greene are three points of a triangulated
star system in U.S. track and field. For that, the country should
be thankful.
</P>
<P>
   It's an isosceles triangle, though, with Jones at the pinnacle
based on her talent, looks, personality and stated goal of winning
five gold medals at the Olympic Games. That plays well in sound
bites on TV but, as she'll learn, it's reality that bites.
</P>
<P>
   Jones is a lock for gold medals in the 100, 200 and 4x100 relay,
but the 4x400 relay is no sure thing and in the long jump, she's a
glamorous hack desperately trying to fake it. It won't work. The
way she's jumping, Mrs. Jones won't come close to earning a long
jump medal _ if she even makes the U.S. team in the event.
</P>
<P>
   At the base of the triangle, Johnson and Greene are holding up
two equal and opposite legs. Johnson is the world record-holder in
the 200 and 400 meters trying to duplicate his awesome performance
from Atlanta four years ago. Greene is the world record-holder in
the 100 with the temerity to invade Johnson's territory in the 200.
Something's got to give.
</P>
<P>
   All three athletes will compete in the Prefontaine Classic on
Saturday at Hayward Field in Eugene, along with a who's who of U.S.
and international athletes in serious preparation for the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   For American athletes, it's the start of a defining month of
competition that continues Sunday in Portland with the Oregon Track
Classic and July 1 at Stanford, Calif., with the GMC Envoy Open,
followed by the Olympic trials July 14-23 at Hornet Stadium on the
Sacramento State campus in California.
</P>
<P>
   With the Olympic trials three weeks away, it's time for
America's best athletes to show their fitness in the three meets
leading up to Sacramento _ Pre, Portland and Stanford. The GMC meet
at Stanford represents the last opportunity for elite competition
prior to the trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``That'll be just right for me in terms of preparation,'' said
Regina Jacobs of Oakland, Calif., who will run the 800 at Pre and
the 3,000 at Portland. ``What motivates me? A lot of unfinished
goals. There are so many things I want to accomplish.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs, 36, a former Stanford runner, won the silver medal at
1,500 meters at last year's World Championships. As a
middle-distance specialist, she'll run the 800 at Pre for speed and
the 3,000 at Portland for endurance, then come back to the middle
for a mile at the GMC meet at Stanford's Cobb Track &AMP; Angell Field
a week from Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   That should put her in good stead for the trials, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The adrenaline that pumps into your body when you compete at
the Olympic trials, with all that energy, it's electric,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pre meet pumps a fair amount of adrenaline, too. On
Saturday, Jones will run the 100 and attempt to find some semblance
of form in the long jump. Johnson will run his first 400 of the
season. Greene will try the 200, which leaves the 100 to such
sprinters as Jon Drummond, Obadele Thompson of the Bahamas, NCAA
champion Bernard Williams of Florida, runner-up Coby Miller of
Auburn and Ja'Warren Hooker of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   As for Jacobs, who just gets better with age, she's in deep in
the Pre 800 against Maria Mutola, the No. 1-ranked half-miler in
the world. Mutola has a best of 1:55.43. Jacobs' fastest is
1:58.55.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking for a really awesome race,'' Jacobs said. ``I know
it's going to be very, very fast. It's going to be a dynamic race.
Maria always races under 2 minutes. Weather permitting, it will be
a fast race.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones, Johnson and Greene will hope for the same thing on a
weekend when track gets serious.

   Al Gore said today he's asked his attorney to make public the
entire 150-page transcript of a ``cooperative and professional''
interview with a federal prosecutor about his 1996 fund-raising
activities. ``I think the truth is my friend in this,'' Gore said.
He said he was making the entire interview public because ``I want
people to judge for themselves.'' The supervising attorney for the
Justice Department's campaign finance task force has recommended
appointment of a special counsel to investigate the truthfulness of
Gore's statements about his 1996 fund-raising at a Buddhist temple.
Attorney General Janet Reno so far hasn't indicated how she'll act
on the recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   `LIFELONG LEARNING 'PROPOSALS
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore was unveiling a $2.3 billion ``lifelong learning''
package today featuring tax breaks and community grants aimed at
expanding working training programs. The proposals, being offered
during a symbolic swing through Silicon Valley, are part of a much
larger $40 billion education package. The $2.3 billion price tag
would be over 10 years, and targeted specifically at training
programs in new high-tech fields. Gore is in the second week of his
``prosperity and progress tour'' where he's seeking credit for the
nation's robust economy.
</P>
<P>
   WATCH GORE TELL YOU MAYBE HE'S JUST TOO BRAINY
</P>
<P>
   In an interview airing on ABC's ``20/20'' tonight, Al Gore says
thinking too hard is one of his weaknesses, and wife Tipper jokes
about having had a ``full-time career working psychologically with
this guy.'' Gore also admits what many believe to be true: ``I'm
not a natural, back-slapping politician.'' His greatest weakness?
Gore said it's that he's too cerebral. ``I think sometimes I turn
too much to my head ... in the sense of trying to think through
problems. And Tipper's taught me over the years to feel the
emotional dimension of the challenges that we face.''
</P>
<P>
   ALL PART OF THE BIGGER PICTURE
</P>
<P>
   Delegates to the Green Party National Convention are meeting
this weekend to nominate Ralph Nader as their candidate for
president, hoping he can provide the party with the higher profile
it needs to make significant inroads in states where their issues
play well. Nader, a lifelong consumer advocate, concedes he has no
chance for the White House, but is looking for a bigger prize. He
hopes to use his increasing clout to push favored issues, such as
election reform, health care and fighting what he says is the
concentration of power in corporate America.
</P>
<P>
   A KEYHOLE INTO CHARACTER
</P>
<P>
   Gary Graham may be dead, but debate over capital punishment will
shadow George W. Bush's White House bid because his state is
scheduled to execute an average of one man a week through Election
Day. Bush's handling of the furor over how the death penalty is
meted out in Texas might be a window into his personality, giving
voters a preview of how he might deal with the nation's weightiest
public policy decisions. ``Someday, he might have to push a button
that doesn't just fry an individual but says, `We are at war,' ''
said Marc Landy, chairman of Boston College's political science
department. ``The issue with Bush is not does he have the guts to
do it, but is he a judicious, thoughtful, mature leader?''
</P>
<P>
   THE NADER FACTOR
</P>
<P>
   Months after they dismissed Ralph Nader as a fringe third-party
candidate who would fade quickly, Democratic and Republican
strategists now say that the consumer advocate has emerged as more
politically potent than Pat Buchanan and could deeply complicate Al
Gore's candidacy. Nader, who is expected to capture the Green
Party's nomination in Denver this weekend, already is forcing Gore
to compete more vigorously for the enthusiastic support of labor
and other groups that are reliably Democratic. And in a tight
general election race with George W. Bush, a few points could make
a difference _ and force Gore to reconsider his strategy in
important states.
</P>
<P>
   COELHO'S PROBLEM A BRAIN CYST
</P>
<P>
   Tony Coelho, the recently exited campaign chairman for Al Gore,
has a brain cyst that doesn't appear to be life-threatening.
Campaign manager Donna Brazile, who has kept in close touch with
Coelho since he stepped down a week ago citing an inflamed colon,
said earlier this week that his health problems turned out to be
worse than first thought: a cyst was discovered at the base of his
brain. Elaborating, Brazile said Coelho, 58, suffered from other
non-life-threatening ailments, including an irregular heartbeat. He
was replaced by Commerce Secretary William Daley.
</P>
<P>
   HE HAD THE WINDFALL AT HIS BACK
</P>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission said it will investigate
Rick Lazio's parlaying $2,300 into $16,000 in one day in stock
option trading. Lazio, running against Hillary Clinton for the
Senate in New York, denied any wrongdoing and said he'll cooperate.
But while Lazio talked cooperation, campaign manager Bill Dal Col
went on the attack: ``The Clinton administration has a long history
of abusing federal authority and using government bureaucracies to
attack their political opponents. Today, they reached a new low.''
No immediate comment from the SEC.
</P>
<P>
   OIL MONEY GREASES THE CAMPAIGN
</P>
<P>
   Oil and gas money has been the essential lubricant of George W.
Bush's political career. It financed his unsuccessful run for
Congress in 1978, helped him win the governor's office in 1994, and
is fueling his run for president now. Bush's biggest lifetime
patrons are employees of the Enron Corp. and at least 25 of his top
fund-raisers, the ``Pioneers,'' are connected to the oil business.
The second-largest source of contributions for his presidential
campaign is the Houston law firm Vinson &AMP; Elkins, which prides
itself on the size and reach of its oil and gas practice.
</P>
<P>
   LET'S SEE THOSE FACES
</P>
<P>
   The Philadelphia City Council, in an effort to prevent violence
at the Republican convention, adopted an anti-mask ordinance
modeled on a Georgia law aimed at combating the Ku Klux Klan. The
council voted 11-5 to make it illegal for anyone to wear a mask
with the intent of threatening or intimidating another person. The
new ordinance, which still must be signed by Mayor John Street, was
crafted with help from the Anti-Defamation League.
</P>
<P>
   MCCAIN KEEPS SCORING IN NEW HAMPSHIRE
</P>
<P>
   Nearly five months after John McCain trounced George W. Bush in
New Hampshire's presidential primary, his campaign has beat the
Bush organization again. The state's 17 delegates to the Republican
convention elected a national committeeman and committeewoman from
McCain's campaign: Michael Dennehy and Nancy Merrill. McCain, the
48-30 percent primary winner, won 10 of the delegates. Bush won
five and publisher Steve Forbes won two.
</P>
<P>
   CAUSE SHE'S JUST A WORKING MOTHER HERSELF
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton raised $200,000 for his wife's New York Senate
campaign at a private reception for wealthy donors at a Georgetown
mansion. Clinton told two dozen people, who paid $10,000 or more
each to attend _ that Hillary Clinton would make a good senator
because she understands the problems faced by working parents.
</P>
<P>
   BUT THE LAKERS ALREADY WON THE TITLE
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to Los Angeles for the 1984 Summer Olympics found a
city transformed: murals depicting the saga of man adorned
freeways, newly planted trees lined roads and the entire city was
swaddled in reds, yellows and blues. But when William Daley, Al
Gore's new campaign chairman, arrived today, he and his staff found
a laid-back city with little being done to prepare for the Aug.
14-17 convention. The major decorating project is a series of small
banners featuring photos of people taken by schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
   REPUTATIONS ARE HARD TO OVERCOME
</P>
<P>
   New Al Gore campaign chief William Daley acknowledges that one
of the biggest challenges facing his man is that George W. Bush is
getting credit for the economy, the issue on which Gore had been
basing his hopes. But, Daley said, that's a ``knee jerk'' reaction
and he hopes to counter it by recruiting supporters from big
business and labor to go to Nashville, where Gore's campaign is
based.
</P>
<P>
   Daley: ``I don't know if it's just kind of a gut thing, but
Republicans have always historically got more credit for running
the economy, and being good for the economy, even at the height of
the deficit. So I think we've got a challenge to remind people what
things were like in 1992.''
</P>
<P>
   `SHADOW CONVENTION' SIDESHOW
</P>
<P>
   A bipartisan coalition of advocacy groups and celebrities is
planning an alternative to the two conventions. The ``shadow
conventions'' are to highlight three issues: the gap between rich
and poor, campaign finance reform, and the failed war on drugs.
Among those sponsoring the event: Common Cause, Public Campaign and
syndicated columnist Arianna Huffington. Among the celebrities:
Sen. John McCain, actors Warren Beatty and Ron Silver,
``Politically Incorrect'' host Bill Maher and comedian Al Franken.
The proceedings are to be Webcast on www.shadowconventions.com.

<P>
   AUTOWORKERS RUN OVER OLD ALLY
</P>
<P>
   The United Automobile Workers has retaliated against a longtime
friend who defied the union and supported the China trade bill. Not
only has the UAW decided against endorsing Rep. Sander Levin
(D-Mich.), but it's thrown its support behind his Republican
opponent, Bart Baron. The UAW and the International Brotherhood of
Teamsters persuaded the Michigan AFL-CIO to remain neutral, instead
of supporting Levin. Some labor leaders are criticizing the union,
arguing that if a Republican is elected in the district, it will be
harder for Democrats to regain control of the House.
</P>
<P>
   HE HAS TO LEARN TO EAT THE GRITS
</P>
<P>
   When William Daley made his first trip as campaign chief to Al
Gore headquarters in Nashville to rally the troops the other day,
he passed up the biscuits and grits at breakfast in favor of a
fruit plate. But attendees said he won points anyway by listening
to their suggestions and complaints. Daley's five-minute rallying
speech was closed to the press, but applause and some cheers could
be heard coming from the room.
</P>
<P>
   ESTRANGED BEDFELLOWS
</P>
<P>
   It's Hinson vs. Hinson in divorce court _ and on the campaign
trail. State Rep. Shirley Hinson faces her estranged husband,
Jimmy, on Tuesday in a Republican primary runoff election for her
seat. The couple's high-profile domestic discord _ which includes
alleged death threats, infidelity rumors, jail time and a
restraining order _ has pushed aside most other issues. ``Without
question, unequivocally, it's about revenge,'' says Shirley Hinson,
50, who has been married for 32 years and got into politics at her
husband's urging.

ENRICO CUCCIA, 92, ITALIAN BANKER 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Enrico Cuccia, a famously reclusive Italian banker who
was at the center of Italian finance for half a century, died
Friday in Milan. He was 92.
</P>
<P>
   Cuccia, who at his death still kept an office at his bank,
Mediobanca SpA, and held the title of honorary chairman, controlled
important parts of the Italian economy for decades, using his bank
to broker mergers and buy shares in a vast web of industrial groups
known as the ``Mediobanca galaxy'' and including Fiat, Pirelli and
Olivetti.
</P>
<P>
   Cuccia was mostly known as a promoter of ``family capitalism,''
using Mediobanca, which for most of its history was controlled by
state banks, to aid Italy's most powerful industrial families like
the Agnellis. Leopoldo Pirelli, the former chairman of Pirelli SpA,
once joked, ``What Cuccia wants, God wants, too.''
</P>
<P>
   When the news of his death broke around noon, the Italian
Banking Association interrupted a meeting for a minute of silence.
In a different kind of homage, on the stock exchange in Milan,
Mediobanca shares went up 6.2 percent as investors gambled that
Cuccia's demise would lead to a reorganization of the Mediobanca
empire, and even a takeover.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few years, Mediobanca lost some of its influence
to foreign competition and a changing Italian economy. But Cuccia
played an important role in the battle last year for Telecom
Italia, the Italian telephone and communications company; he
advised Olivetti as it beat a rival offer from Deutsche Telekom in
the takeover of Telecom Italia.
</P>
<P>
   Cuccia, a short, stooped man who favored gray suits, never gave
interviews; news photographers stalked him on his way to work. But
his reticence had limits. His most recent entry in Who's Who in
Italy described him as having played ``a major role in all of the
major financial operations in Italy.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Rome to a Sicilian family, Cuccia began his career at
Italy's central bank and in 1934 moved to the Istituto per la
Ricostuzione Industriale, or IRI, a state holding company that had
been set up in 1932 by the fascist government to manage state
property. The IRI founder and chairman, Alberto Beneduce, became
his father-in-law in 1939.
</P>
<P>
   In 1938, Cuccia began working at the state-controlled Banca
Commerciale Italiana. His father-in-law tapped him in 1946 to start
Mediobanca, which was created by two IRI-controlled banks and the
Banco di Roma to act as a medium-term lender for big industry, an
activity then forbidden to Italian commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
   Under his leadership, Mediobanca bought minority shares in
important companies and became their banker, arranging major
mergers. Cuccia arranged the 1966 merger of Montecatini and Edison,
which became Italy's chemical giant, Montedison.
</P>
<P>
   He worked closely with the Fiat chairman Gianni Agnelli. In
1986, Cuccia helped the wealthy Agnelli family get rid of the
Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi as a shareholder in Fiat by buying
back shares of the automotive empire worth $3.1 billion. Cuccia
made the Agnellis even richer, but the complicated financial
arrangement he devised cost an international group of banks $600
million in losses.
</P>
<P>
   Cuccia's cachet remained intact, but his absolute power seemed
to wane in the early 1990s, when several deals he sought to broker
fell through. However, it was mostly the changes in the Italian
economy that loosened Cuccia's grip on major transactions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Italian economic world was made of state holdings and
family-owned fortunes,'' said Fabio Tamburini, author of ``A
Sicilian in Milan,'' an unauthorized biography of Cuccia.
``Mediobanca, which was controlled by IRI and has as its board
members the most powerful families, was the clearinghouse for these
two worlds, which today no longer exist.''
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Giuliano Amato, a former head of Italy's
antitrust authority, was one of many who on Friday paid tribute to
Cuccia's prominent role in recent Italian history, but he also made
clear that he disapproved of Cuccia's web of cross-shareholdings,
which critics viewed as stifling competition.
</P>
<P>
   Noting the coincidence that Cuccia died a few days before IRI,
the symbol of state ownership, was due to be closed after the sale
of most of its assets, Amato said, ``He represented the best of
Italian capitalism, which is now undergoing profound
transformation.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuccia's wife, whose unusual first name, Idea Nuova Socialista
(New Socialist Idea), reflected the ideological fashions of an
earlier era, died in 1996. Cuccia is survived by two daughters and
a son.

IN MONICA'S STORY, A CHAPTER ON ENTREPRENEURSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   By ABBY ELLIN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Monica Lewinsky breezed into her mother and
stepfather's penthouse apartment in Manhattan and sighed. After
apologizing for being late _ she couldn't find a cab, traffic was
awful _ she kissed her stepfather goodbye as he was leaving and
plopped down in a chair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so lucky,'' she murmured. It's not the sort of assessment
that one might expect from Lewinsky, but she seemed to mean it.
</P>
<P>
   At 26, she is still young, but she seemed poised, no longer the
wide-eyed White House intern. And she appeared excited about her
role at the helm of her new handbag-design company, The Real Monica
Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Her handbags, made of cloth in a ``hippie chic'' style, are sold
at Henri Bendel in Manhattan, at Fred Segal Melrose in West
Hollywood, Calif., and on her Web site, therealmonicainc.com. ``I
originally wanted to use Monicainc.com, but that was taken,'' she
said. ``A friend said, `What about The Real Monica Inc.?' and I
thought, `OK.'''
</P>
<P>
   By now the story of how she started her business is almost as
well-known as the person. Two years ago, while the White House
scandal was playing out, Lewinsky had some time on her hands. She
put it to use knitting, but found that she couldn't afford the bag
she wanted for carrying the yarn. Having some experience in sewing
_ she designed costumes for high school plays _ she decided to make
her own handbags.
</P>
<P>
   Friends loved them _ and suggested that she place them in
stores. She did some research and, with help from a few friends,
wrote a loosely detailed mission statement, which provided general
information about the product line and guidelines for how the
company would be run.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided that the Web would really be the best place to
start,'' she said. ``We have a 24-hour store, in every city, in
every state, in every country in the world. And we've had sales all
over the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The site has had more than 5 million hits since its debut last
September. On March 22, when the bags were first sold at Bendel's,
she received 400 e-mail messages. She does not respond to such
notes personally, but a small customer service department does, and
she says she takes suggestions seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get tons of e-mails from young people starting out and they
want advice,'' she said. ``It's a difficult situation: I don't know
that I feel comfortable giving anybody advice.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky is not in charge of company finances, having delegated
the job to one of her four partners. ``I'm involved in the sense
that I know what's going on, but not in the day to day,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But she designs all the bags, which are sewn by hand at an
apparel manufacturer in Louisiana, where about 12 people are
working for her.
</P>
<P>
   She buys the fabric herself from showrooms in Dallas and in the
garment district of Manhattan. ``They all know me by name,'' she
said, then stopped and laughed: ``Well, everyone knows me by my
name, but they think of me as a different Monica, not that one.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, she said, no one seems fazed by her notoriety. ``The
people with whom I've been working have been wonderful,'' she said.
``At first there was probably a slight hesitation to take what I
was doing seriously, but after they spent about five minutes with
me they began to treat me like they would any customer.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many other young Internet entrepreneurs, she readily
acknowledged that she knew nothing about business before starting
her company. ``If you'd said, B-to-B? B-to-C? Venture capital? I'd
have thought it was a ride at Disney,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But she is learning quickly. She's had to.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, people were not exactly begging to be involved in
a Monica Lewinsky project. And contrary to popular perception, she
said, she is not a millionaire _ and is instead working to get out
of debt. Although she declined to be specific, published reports
have put her legal fees at $1.5 million. (She reportedly earned
$500,000 for her book, ``Monica's Story,'' and had a $300,000
endorsement deal with Jenny Craig, the diet company.)
</P>
<P>
   ``People have such a misconception about my financial
situation,'' she said. ``My parents aren't helping me out; I paid
them back for the money they put out.'
</P>
<P>
   Her finances were so precarious that at first she bought fabric
at retail _ partly, she said, because she wanted to keep the
business a secret until it was ready, partly because she didn't
think she would get credit as a young entrepreneur. ``I used to
make fun of myself for that, but I recently heard from several
people that a lot of people start out buying materials retail,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Now she does have credit, and a viable product. She and her four
partners, who prefer to remain anonymous _ all are friends, with
either business, Web or design experience _ are negotiating for
venture capital. She did not disclose specifics, but as for sales,
she said, ``Our first quarter in 2000 is two times that of our
first quarter in 1999, and we're expecting similar growth for the
second quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   Is she exploiting herself to make a buck? After all, on the Web
site are the handwritten words ``Made especially for you by
Monica,'' surrounded by roses. There is also a list of questions,
like ``Where can I acquire autographed books and pictures?'' (The
answer: For now, you can't.) and ``What is the lipstick that Monica
wore on the Barbara Walters special?'' (Club Monaco Glaze).
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite frankly, the name is what attracts people to the
product, but what's going to satisfy the customer is that it's a
great product,'' Lewinsky said. ``I don't want people to think I'm
taking advantage of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Ed Burstell, the general manager at Bendel's, agreed. ``We
bought 200 bags and did a blind test last Christmas, with no hype
at all,'' he recalled. ``They evaporated in two weeks. They really
fit in fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   In March, 250 bags were sold at Bendel's the day that Lewinsky
appeared in the store. Burstell estimated that nearly 500 people
showed up to see her bags _ or, perhaps, to see her.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky said of that day, ``To see all of the bags there,
displayed so beautifully and to be in such a prominent place, I
just started crying.''
</P>
<P>
   Burstell first heard about the bags from a friend who had seen
them in California and told him to call Lewinsky. He did. They met,
and he was impressed. ``I was amazed at how funny she is,'' he
said, ``and she comes unattended'' _ without an entourage _ ``which
I found refreshing.''
</P>
<P>
   Bendel's just received its summer order: 400 new purses and
totes, priced from $80 to $170. ``They'll go soon,'' Burstell said.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky has just finished designing a fall-winter-holiday line
that will hit the shelves at the end of summer. Other pieces _ a
makeup case, messenger bag, and a ``Mommy tote'' for things like
diapers _ are in the works.
</P>
<P>
   She is also considering taking classes, most likely in
e-commerce, to prepare for the future.
</P>
<P>
   And is she proud of herself?
</P>
<P>
   She smiled. ``When something goes from conception to opening on
the Web, to selling out at Christmas and being in stores like
Bendel's and Fred Segal, to then looking into getting venture
capital _ all within the year _ that is something to smile about,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Especially if you compare it to the year before.''

SEEING DRUGS AS A CHOICE OR AS A BRAIN ANOMALY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Duplication warning: Also moved in `e' category) 
(Michael Massing is the author of ``The Fix,'' a study of drug
policy in the United States since the 1960s.) 
 By MICHAEL MASSING   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Alan I. Leshner, the director of the National Institute on
Drug Abuse, a division of the National Institutes of Health, is
known for his slide shows. Two or three times a week he gives a
speech _ to treatment counselors and prevention specialists,
physicians and policy-makers _ and almost all feature slides culled
from the work of the 1,200 researchers supported by his institute.
</P>
<P>
   The slides are of brain scans, and they usually come in pairs.
The ``before'' slides show the activity of a normal brain; the
``after'' ones depict a brain that has had prolonged exposure to
drugs. Lacing his presentation with jokes and Yiddish expressions _
as a youth, Leshner summered at a Catskills hotel owned by his
grandparents, and he has a bit of Alan King in him _ he tries to
translate the science into plain English.
</P>
<P>
   What the science shows, he says, is that the brain of an addict
is fundamentally different from that of a nonaddict. Initially,
when a person uses hard drugs like heroin or cocaine, the chemistry
of the brain is not much affected, and the decision to take the
drugs remains voluntary. But at a certain point, he says, a
``metaphorical switch in the brain'' gets thrown, and the
individual moves into a state of addiction characterized by
compulsive drug use. These brain changes, Leshner says, persist
long after addicts stop using drugs, which is why, he continues,
relapse is so common. Addiction, Leshner declares, should be
approached more like other chronic illnesses, like diabetes and
hypertension. Going further, he says that drugs so alter the brain
that addiction can be compared to mental disorders like Alzheimer's
disease and schizophrenia. It is, he says, a ``brain disease.''
</P>
<P>
   In promoting this concept, Leshner has stepped forthrightly into
a debate that has smoldered for decades: Are drug addicts
responsible for their behavior? Should they be treated as sick
people in need of help, or as bad people in need of punishment?
Leshner has come down squarely on the side of illness. And he is
winning many people over. Today the brain-disease model is widely
accepted in the addiction field, and Barry R. McCaffrey, the White
House drug adviser, routinely invokes it.
</P>
<P>
   Others are not convinced. ``I reject the notion that addicts
fall under the spell of drugs and become a zombie and so are not
responsible for anything they do,'' says Dr. Sally L. Satel, a
senior associate at the Ethics and Public Policy Center in
Washington and a practicing psychiatrist at a methadone clinic. To
her and other critics, the brain-disease model is a new orthodoxy
based less on science than on a desire to soften the stigma
attached to addiction.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that addiction is a disease is not new. In the 1960s
Alcoholics Anonymous began speaking of alcoholism as a disease.
But, initially at least, AA used the term figuratively to suggest
the tenacious hold drinking has on alcoholics. Over the last decade
or so, however, advances in brain-imaging technology have allowed
researchers to measure the impact of psychoactive substances on the
brain with increasing precision. Investigators have found that
drugs like cocaine, heroin and alcohol increase the brain's
production of dopamine, the neurotransmitter that regulates
pleasure, among other things. This helps account for the euphoric
high drug users feel. But these drugs deplete the dopamine pathway,
disrupting the individual's ability to function.
</P>
<P>
   At the Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island, for
instance, Dr. Nora D. Volkow has found that even 100 days after a
cocaine addict's last dose, there is significant disruption in the
brain's frontal cortical area, which governs such attributes as
impulse, motivation and drive. Volkow says that ``the disruption of
the dopamine pathways leads to a decrease in the reinforcing value
of normal things, and this pushes the individual to take drugs to
compensate.''
</P>
<P>
   Other researchers have found a physiological basis for the
craving so many addicts experience, but it is not yet clear how
long such physiological changes remain.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Herbert D. Kleber, the medical director of the National
Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse in New York, says that the
brain-disease concept fits with his experience with thousands of
addicts over the years. ``No one wants to be an addict,'' he says.
``All anyone wants to be able to do is knock back a few drinks with
the guys on Friday or have a cigarette with coffee or take a toke
on a crack pipe. But very few addicts can do this. When someone
goes from being able to control their habit to mugging their
grandmother to get money for their next fix, that convinces me that
something has changed in their brain.''
</P>
<P>
   But does causing changes in the brain qualify addiction as a
brain disease? Not according to Dr. Gene M. Heyman, a lecturer at
the Harvard Medical School and a research psychologist at McLean
Hospital in Boston. ``Since we can visualize the brain of someone
who's craving, people say, `Ah hah, addiction is a brain
disease,''' he remarks. ``But when someone sees a McDonald's
hamburger, things are going on in the brain, too, but that doesn't
tell you whether their behavior is involuntary or not.''
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging that addiction does induce compulsive
behavior, Heyman says that addicts still retain a degree of
volition, as evidenced by the many who stop using drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smoking meets the criteria for addiction, but 50 percent of
smokers have quit,'' he says. This change, he goes on, is
``demonstrably related'' to the data about the hazards of smoking
that have emerged since the surgeon general's report on the subject
in 1964. By contrast, Heyman says, ``information about
schizophrenia hasn't reduced the frequency of that illness.''
</P>
<P>
   Heyman also cites a well-known study of Vietnam veterans who
were dependent on heroin while overseas. Within three years of
their return to the United States, the study found, nearly 90
percent were no longer using it _ strong evidence, Heyman says,
that the addictive state is not permanent.
</P>
<P>
   Sally Satel first became skeptical about the brain-disease model
in 1997, when she attended a conference of the drug-abuse institute
on the medical treatment of heroin addiction. ``So pervasive was
the idea that a dysfunctional brain is the root of addiction that I
was able to sit through the entire two-and-a-half-day meeting
without once hearing such words as `responsibility,' 'choice,'
'character' _ the vocabulary of personhood,'' Satel wrote in a
paper called ``Is Drug Addiction a Brain Disease?''
</P>
<P>
   Written with Dr. Frederick K. Goodwin and published as a booklet
by the Ethics and Public Policy Center, the paper offers a
blistering attack on the drug-abuse institute and its brain-disease
terminology. ``Dramatic visuals are seductive and lend scientific
credibility to NIDA's position,'' the paper states, but politicians
``should resist this medicalized portrait for at least two reasons.
</P>
<P>
   First, it appears to reduce a complex human activity to a slice
of damaged brain tissue. Second, and most important, it vastly
underplays the reality that much of addictive behavior is
voluntary.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   To support that claim, Satel cited the results of the
Epidemiologic Catchment Area study, paid for by the National
Institute of Mental Health, which asked 20,300 adults about their
psychological history. Of the 1,300 people who were found to have
been dependent on or abusing drugs, 59 percent said they had not
been users for at least a year before the interview; the average
time of remission was 2.7 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that many, perhaps most addicts are in control of
their actions and appetites for circumscribed periods of time shows
that they are not perpetually helpless victims of a chronic
disease,'' Satel said.
</P>
<P>
   At the mention of Satel, Leshner bristles. ``Simplistic and
polarizing,'' he says of her writing. More generally, Leshner
maintains that his views have been distorted and misinterpreted.
Still, he says, he has lately modified his message, giving more
recognition to the role of volition in addiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's version,'' he says, is that addiction is ``a brain
disease expressed as compulsive behavior; both its development and
the recovery from it depend on the individual's behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Where does choice end and compulsion begin? The slide showing
that has not yet appeared.

RUSSIAN MEDIA MAGNATE REFUSES TO ANSWER PROSECUTORS 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Vladimir Gusinsky, the Russian media tycoon whose
arrest last week raised fears here of a crackdown on the press,
refused to answer questions Friday from state prosecutors who say
he helped defraud the government. He called the charges nonsense.
</P>
<P>
   President Vladimir Putin gathered his security advisers in the
Kremlin on Friday to draft a new national ``information doctrine''
_ one that Putin said would be rooted in total press freedom and
the absence of state censorship.
</P>
<P>
   The two counterpoints only underscored the breadth of the gulf
separating the Kremlin and Gusinsky, a frequent critic whose
businesses have come under growing government pressure this year.
</P>
<P>
   Gusinsky is apparently accused _ the prosecutors' inquiry
remains secret _ of swindling the state out of $10 million during
his purchase of a St. Petersburg television station in 1997. He has
said that his holding company, Media-Most, actually poured nearly
$5 million into what was then a penniless business.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the head of Putin's security council suggested
that the Kremlin's view of a free press might not square with that
of Gusinsky or other liberals.
</P>
<P>
   Putin was quoted as telling the security council that ``without
a free media, there is no free society.'' But the security council
head, Sergei Ivanov, said later that the council did not exclude
creating an ``appropriate state mechanism'' to ensure public
support for the government.
</P>
<P>
   That hinted at a new state information agency or ministry, a
prospect certain to alarm those who remember the Soviet Union's
overpowering propaganda machine.
</P>
<P>
   Gusinsky on Friday accused the government of trying to shoehorn
the independent press into that role, saying that his prosecution
was designed to install a new head of Media-Most who would ``force
journalists to tell stories about the grandness of our president.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody even seems to be trying to hide that it is absurd,'' he
said. ``I am not going to take part in this nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   Gusinsky's empire, which includes the nation's only independent
television network, leading newspapers and a weekly newsmagazine,
has been a frequent problem for the Kremlin and a sharp critic of
Putin's policy on the war in Chechnya. Gusinsky has also been close
to political rivals of the Kremlin, like Moscow's mayor, Yuri
Luzhkov.
</P>
<P>
   As if to cap a week of maneuvering by the two enemies, the
prosecutors said Friday that Gusinsky would not be allowed the
leave the country this weekend to visit his family, who live in
Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has stayed above any bad blood between the Kremlin and
Media-Most, even saying that he was not told in advance of
Gusinsky's arrest last week. But his government has been pressing
the company on many fronts this year, from private warnings to tone
down its television news coverage to public threats by a major
creditor, the state-controlled Gazprom natural-gas monopoly, to
call in its loans.
</P>
<P>
   Gazprom, which says it owns 14 percent of Media-Most outright
and holds another 40 percent as loan collateral, ratcheted up the
pressure again this week, naming a former Kremlin official to
oversee its media holdings and negotiate with Gusinsky for
repayment of the loans.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has been variously assailed by Moscow's liberals and
intellectuals as a tool of warring tycoons and a threat to
democracy for the government's actions against Gusinsky and
Media-Most. But outside Moscow the case has raised barely a ripple.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Nor does it seem to have affected his political clout. On Friday
the lower house of Parliament voted overwhelmingly to approve
Putin's plan to reshape Parliament's upper house, the Federation
Council, by ousting all of Russia's governors and their appointees
from the body.
</P>
<P>
   The change is universally seen as strengthening Putin's grip on
Russia's wayward provinces _ and weakening the governors,
potentially some of his most powerful opponents.
</P>
<P>
   But despite this week's talk of a crackdown on the press and a
move toward authoritarian rule, the lower house voted 302-86 for
the measure. Putin needed 300 votes to override any veto by the
Federation Council, and political analysts said Friday that he
could get even more if the upper house decides to fight the
overhaul.

   NHL DRAFT

<P>
   CALGARY _ Advance on NHL entry draft. Thrashers are scheduled to
have the No. 2 pick. (Schultz, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).16.

   NBA DRAFT
</P>
<P>
   BKN-DRAFT-MIHM _ AUSTIN _ Orlando Magic General Manager John
Gabriel has two words for those who would dismiss Chris Mihm
offhand as unfit to play center effectively in the NBA. Brad
Daugherty. Gabriel considers Daugherty a cautionary tale for those
taking measure of NBA draft prospects. Daugherty, a college star at
North Carolina in the mid-1980s, was widely considered to lack the
toughness necessary to work near the basket as a pro. As NBA scouts
took measure of him, Daugherty was tattooed with the ``S'' word _
too soft. Based on that reputation, Philadelphia, which had the No.
1 pick in the 1986 draft, traded it to Cleveland. As it turned out,
Daugherty became one of the better centers in the NBA. Using skill
and athleticism more than muscle and intimidation, Daugherty became
a five-time all-star, averaging 19 points a game before his career
was cut short after eight seasons because of a back injury.
Gabriel, voted the NBA's top executive this season, says, ``I think
you have to be careful when you label people soft. I was part of
that staff in Philadelphia. We could have drafted Daugherty, but
there were concerns that he was too soft.''Chris Mihm is an NBA
player. (Rosner, Austin American-Statesman). 49. WITH FILE PHOTO.

<P>
   BKN-DRAFT-SPURS _ AUSTIN _ The San Antonio Spurs do not have a
first-round draft pick, a condition they are considering changing.
The Spurs would have selected 24th in the draft Wednesday if they
had not traded their pick to Chicago for guard Steve Kerr in
January, 1998. Hoping to move back into the first round, the Spurs
will offer the two second-round picks they hold, Nos. 41 and 54
overall. The 41st pick was acquired in a trade with Dallas last
year. No. 54 is the Spurs' own second-round slot.The Spurs, who do
not have a first-rounder, may try to trade two seconds for a first.
(Rosner, Austin American-Statesman).
</P>
<P>
   BKN-DRAFT-ROCKETS _ AUSTIN _ Carroll Dawson, the Houston Rockets
executive vice president of basketball, figures the law of averages
will prevent him from making a blockbuster deal during this year's
NBA draft. After all, the Rockets stunned the league last year,
acquiring point guard Steve Francis, the second pick in the draft,
in a trade with
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver.The Houston Rockets have a first round pick and are
looking for a player to match with Steve Francis. (Rosner, Austin
American-Statesman).16.

   OLYMPICS
</P>
<P>
   RUN-MARIONJONES _ Advance two big track meets _ Prefontaine meet
at Eugene, Ore. and Adidas meet at Portland, Ore. Marion Jones has
brashly staked her claim on 5 gold medals in Sydney, but she'll
need a lot of luck not to slip up in the long jump. The field event
gives her fits, and she'll try to master it and the 100 meters at
the Prefontaine Classic. (Fish, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

BOILING IT DOWN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, June   25)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To begin with, there's too much news.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the day shift got to work Friday at the Globe's
foreign desk, there were already 755 stories in the foreign news
computer queue. And that doesn't take into account what our own
people were writing from their outposts, what the various news
services would continue to pour forth during Friday's news cycle,
and whatever accident, flood, famine, terrorist act, or film star
scandal erupted while I was getting coffee.
</P>
<P>
   What we do is try to sort it out for you, what happened in the
rest of the world. It's like bolting a water bubbler onto the end
of a gushing firehose. You have to slow it down and squirt it in
one direction in order to drink it.
</P>
<P>
   If you think of news as casualties on the battlefield of life,
the term is ``triage,'' sorting out which cases are urgent, which
can wait temporarily, and which can afford a good leaving alone for
a while.
</P>
<P>
   If your metaphor of choice is the supermarket, we try to stock
the shelves with a reasonably balanced selection of meat, potatoes,
green vegetables, canned soups, soda pop, and cookies (that would
be the comics). Foreign news, study after study tell us as the
circulation folk peer over the reader surveys, is in the category
of broccoli, kale, Chinese cabbage, and rutabaga.
</P>
<P>
   Readers know it's supposed to be good for them; they just have
to force themselves to choke it down. Friday's queue contained
hundreds of more-or-less routine items, including one slugged
``French-dogpoop'' that would have informed you that it costs
Parisian taxpayers 10 francs per kilo for what city employees scoop
up on their ``poobikes.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether you get to read a story or not always comes down to some
editor's decision. Orders. Whim. Hunch. Whatever.
</P>
<P>
   So in the never-ending battle of scheming how to get the
customers to eat their spinach, editors have some rules of thumb.
Terrorism goes first, plane crashes (often the same category) go
second, floods or hurricanes next, and earthquakes, depending upon
the number of dead and the amount of dramatic video tape readily at
hand.
</P>
<P>
   Then we move over into the slow lane: Chiefs of state nattering,
foreign ministers convening, do-gooders conclaving,
non-governmental-organizations decrying. And then there's the UN.
The United Nations, so elegant in concept, so expensive in budget,
so ineffective in practice, so infuriating in bureaucratic
tendentiousness. The UN. So easy to get mad at.
</P>
<P>
   What will happen this week in Geneva is yet another attempt by
the UN to address the bedeviling challenges of globalization, this
time in Geneva, at a five-year-after-the-fact follow-up to see how
things have changed since the Copenhagen meeting of 1995 that tried
to set things right.
</P>
<P>
   Rare will be the newspaper that will devote much if any space to
the deliberations in Geneva of the Special Session of the General
Assembly on Social Development. At issue is globalization _ how do
the poor fare while the rich are going gangbusters?
</P>
<P>
   There is fierce debate underway among the experts, economists,
bureaucrats, bankers, politicians, NGO-ers, and assorted kibbitzers
about how best to bring the really-poor up into the working-stiff
category.
</P>
<P>
   Sample debate: Is Nike a filthy-rich corporate exploiter of poor
peasant labor in Vietnam stitching together sneakers for
overprivileged American kids? Or is Nike a genuine force for good
in a Third World backwater where it provides jobs for 50,000
peasants who'd otherwise be pulling rice plants out of the mud for
pennies a day?
</P>
<P>
   When you get to the level of the United Nations, or the World
Bank, or the International Monetary Fund, these debates become
terribly complex. Which is why you can understand the editorial
temptation to run the ``French-dogpoop'' story ahead of the dreary
analysis from Geneva about how there was this terrifically
complicated debate about how to deal with globalization.
</P>
<P>
   As an expert on neither subject, I can approach this challenge
in the true spirit of journalism: starting from ignorance. I am
with Sir Francs Bacon: start in certainty, end in doubt; start in
doubt, end in certainty. Maybe. Since no one can figure out yet if
Sir Frank was the real Shakespeare or not, I figure he must have
started out in certainty on that one.
</P>
<P>
   But back to Geneva: On one side are those who think development
has to come first, and social progress and poverty-fighting later.
On another side, there are those who advocate helping the poor
first, and not being so immediately concerned with unleashing
market forces. It's a gross oversimplification, no doubt, but then
so is much of journalism.
</P>
<P>
   I only have about 15 lines left here. I'll make this simple:
About one out of five people on this planet live on less than a
dollar a day. That's the bottom line. When the World Bank expert
hired to write this year's World Development Report, Ravi Kanbur,
quit in protest over the way things were going, a lot of academics,
outsiders, and NGO types expressed alarm.
</P>
<P>
   Writing Wednesday in the Financial Times, Martin Wolf put it
this way: ``The World Bank is not Oxfam . . . this dispute
demonstrates that the Bank cannot run with both the pro-growth,
pro-market hares and the anti-growth, anti-market hounds. It has to
choose between them.''
</P>
<P>
   We'll see another version of this conflict between pro- and
anti-market forces played out in the streets outside the American
political conventions this summer, just as we saw the street
theater in Seattle over the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   The person America elects as president this November will have
more influence over the outcome of this argument, as over so many
others, than any one else among the 6 million-plus roaming the
planet.

&HT;     ABC TAKES A GAMBLE ON ITS FRONT-LINE `MFN' TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By PETE DOUGHERTY   
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forty-five minutes into a conference call that was convened
Thursday to allow 125 reporters to speak with the new ``Monday
Night Football'' principles, Dan Fouts' voice was heard for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
   The Hall of Fame quarterback definitely wasn't the newsmaker.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to spice what the network perceived as a
``sameness'' to its NFL telecasts, ABC hired comedian Dennis Miller
_ and Fouts _ to fill the booth alongside Al Michaels.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who tried (some would say unsuccessfully) to follow
Chevy Chase on ``Saturday Night Live,'' now is left with trying to
bring back the prime-time magic missing from ``Monday Night
Football'' since the departure of the late Howard Cosell in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't Chevy,'' Miller said. ``I'm not going to be Howard.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Howard is gone. Don (Meredith) is counting his money in Santa
Fe,'' producer Don Ohlmeyer said. ``The world is a different place
than it was in the mid-'70s. Howard, who was outrageous at that
time, I'm not sure would be that outrageous today. We're not trying
to recreate the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Then just why is ABC venturing into the new millennium with a
comedian in the booth?
</P>
<P>
   Some critics accused Ohlmeyer, who returns to the MNF role he
held in the 1970s, of trying to stir publicity. If that was
Ohlmeyer's motive, it worked. Names from Rush Limbaugh to Bill
Parcells to Sterling Sharpe were thrown about in the 3 1/2 months
since Boomer Esiason was fired.
</P>
<P>
   ``People aren't going to tune in week after week to watch a
buzz,'' Ohlmeyer said. ``Like at Indianapolis, at a certain point
the green flag drops. Everybody involved in the telecast either
performs or they don't.''
</P>
<P>
   All parties made it clear that Miller wasn't hired to launch a
nightclub act in the booth, although his persistent attempts to
inject humor into the conference call Thursday were grating.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know football like a nerd,'' Miller said. ``I've watched it
my whole life. I'm going to try to stay in the background and ask
questions a fan might ask. I'm not going to pontificate about what
I think a guy should be or shouldn't be doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ohlmeyer and Michaels spent Thursday trying to convince the
skeptics that Miller, unlike his ``Saturday Night Live''
predecessors, is a ready-for-prime-time player.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both Al and I were just knocked out by some of the
observations Dennis made,'' Ohlmeyer said of an in-studio audition
Miller did with Michaels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walked out of there thinking Dennis knew as much about the
National Football League as anybody we brought in and anybody I had
talked to over the last several years,'' Michaels said. ``He was
completely up to speed on everything.''
</P>
<P>
   If Miller isn't up to speed, the sophisticated Monday night
audience will know it. From that standpoint, this is a bigger
gamble than when ABC brought Esiason in to replace Frank Gifford.

   `PAPAL SIN' OFFERS HOPE FOR GAYS, CATHOLIC CHURCH. This week,
columnist Chuck Colbert reports on Gary Wills, a devout Catholic,
Pulitzer Prize-winning author and adjunct professor of history at
Northwestern University, whose just-published book, ``Papal Sin,''
offers a blistering attack on the papacy and its ``structures of
deceit.'' Colbert met Wills at a recent book reading at the Brattle
Theatre in Cambridge, Mass., and was impressed with what the writer
had to say. ``To be honest, I don't fully share (Wills')
optimism,'' Colbert writes. ``I don't, for example, hold much
hopein the near future for honesty and truth telling about
homosexuality and gay people in the public sphere _ at least from
priests and bishops, let alone officials in the Vatican. But his
words were inspiring _ just what the Catholic Church needs to
hear.'' (slugged: BC-PAPAL-SIN-NEW-AMERICA-NYTSF)

   LATINO ATHLETES GO FOR SUMMER OLYMPIC GOLD. The Olympic summer
games will showcase several Latino athletes who are favored to take
home gold medals. Leading the pack is diver Mark Ruiz, who has
already been described as the heir apparent to diving great Greg
Louganis. The Latino athletes traveling to Sidney, Australia, with
Team USA will likely excel in the sports you would expect _ boxing,
baseball and soccer. They will also participate and excel in events
in which Latinos aren't traditionally as strong _ sports such as
canoeing, kayaking and taekwondo. This article is excerpted from

   A FORMER MIGRANT WORKER REMEMBERS DRIVE-IN MOVIES. Columnist
Bill Maxwell laments the closing of St. Petersburg's remaining
outdoor movie theater _ the 28th Street Drive-In. Maxwell, who came
from a family of migrant workers, recalls his childhood love affair
with drive-in movie theaters. He writes: ``No matter where we
traveled, a drive-in was within driving distance. As black migrant
farm workers, we were always strangers ... Rarely were we welcomed
in indoor theaters. But drive-ins were different ... In a strange
way, the drive-in experience gave us dignity.'' (slugged:

   FEWER BLACK YOUTHS PURSUE BASEBALL CAREERS. ``These days, fewer
black kids are picking up bats and balls, and among those who do,
few are holding on to them into high school, college and the
pros,'' writes Kevin Blackistone, a columnist for Emerge magazine.
Why? There are more partial scholarships and fewer free rides
available on the baseball diamond. Kids and parents who are looking
to sports to finance a college education are more likely to pursue
football and basketball, where the chance of winning a full
scholarship is much greater. (slugged:

<P>
   I love it.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Miller: Yuppie satirist, award-winning talk show host,
king of the run-on sentence peppered with cultural references,
political asides and f-bombs _ and the new co-host of ABC's
``Monday Night Football.''
</P>
<P>
   In the booth, 46-year-old Miller joins play-by-play man Al
Michaels and another newcomer, former San Diego Charger great Dan
Fouts.
</P>
<P>
   ABC calls the Miller move a risk. I call it potentially great
theater. People will tune in just to see if this stand-in fan
immolates himself on live national television.
</P>
<P>
   Fouts, a Hall of Famer and ABC college football commentator who
previously did NFL games for CBS, was a safe pick. Call it a
running play up the middle on third-and-one.
</P>
<P>
   But Miller? Miller? That's a double-reverse, halfback option
pass from your own 1-yard line. You just don't do it. You'll be
crucified when it blows upon you.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, if it works ...
</P>
<P>
   And it very well might. Sports fans are muttering astonished
four-syllable ``Whaaaaaats?'', while many sportswriters and
commentators are already waxing indignant. Let 'em. Me? After the
initial shock, I smiled, then giggled.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah it's sports, but sports today is show business. Get over
it.
</P>
<P>
   If it's a tight game, football fans are going to watch even if
Pauly Shore is doing the commentary. But to combat a ratings slide
propelled in part by the popularity of Monday night wrestling on
cable _ as well as keep viewers during dog games _ ABC had to
gamble.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe a glib, unconventional talk-show host like Miller _ whose
appointment is already creating a buzz beyond the sports pages _
could make it a show again, provided he proves he knows a tight end
from the end zone. Remember, ``MNF'' was famous for the
entertainment value it got from the late Howard ``I Never Played
the Game'' Cosell, who came to announcing after a career as a
lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Consider what Miller, a former ``Saturday Night Live'' cast
member, said on his HBO show ``Dennis Miller Live'' back in 1996:
</P>
<P>
   ``If I see one more athlete make a routine play and do a wild
banshee itchy dance, I'm going to slap the man senseless with my
remote, strap him in the Tony Burgess chair, toothpick his eyes
open, and make him watch a little bit of the old Nike
ultracommercialism till he pukes.''
</P>
<P>
   When was the last time you heard a former player drop a
``Clockwork Orange'' reference into a telecast?
</P>
<P>
   Or:
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, if I have to see Neon Deion
Prime-Time-Do-Rag-Video-Game-Rap-Album-
Krugerrand-Necklace-Wearing-Pizza-Hut-Two-Sport Sanders
high-stepping in the end zone like some kind of Bob Fosse-trained
Nazi one more time, I think I'm going to do the Icky Shuffle right
off a (expletive) cliff.''
</P>
<P>
   Admit it: That is a whole lot better than ``What a great play,
Al!''
</P>
<P>
   Michaels calls a very good game, and does his homework. Fouts
will supply the Xs and Os, breaking down the zone blitz and hitch
patterns and trap blocks.
</P>
<P>
   Miller? Let him rag on the fat drunk guy in the stands wearing
face paint and no shirt.
</P>
<P>
   It's insane. It's going to be a disaster. Then again, maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes a running back can throw a decent pass from his own
goal line.
</P>
<P>
   But, as Miller says: That's just my opinion. I could be wrong.
</P>

   `PAPAL SIN' OFFERS HOPE FOR GAYS, CATHOLIC CHURCH. This week,
columnist Chuck Colbert reports on Gary Wills, a devout Catholic,
Pulitzer Prize-winning author and adjunct professor of history at
Northwestern University, whose just-published book, ``Papal Sin,''
offers a blistering attack on the papacy and its ``structures of
deceit.'' Colbert met Wills at a recent book reading at the Brattle
Theatre in Cambridge, Mass., and was impressed with what the writer
had to say. ``To be honest, I don't fully share (Wills')
optimism,'' Colbert writes. ``I don't, for example, hold much
hopein the near future for honesty and truth telling about
homosexuality and gay people in the public sphere _ at least from
priests and bishops, let alone officials in the Vatican. But his
words were inspiring _ just what the Catholic Church needs to
hear.'' (slugged: BC-PAPAL-SIN-NEW-AMERICA-NYTSF)

   LATINO ATHLETES GO FOR SUMMER OLYMPIC GOLD. The Olympic summer
games will showcase several Latino athletes who are favored to take
home gold medals. Leading the pack is diver Mark Ruiz, who has
already been described as the heir apparent to diving great Greg
Louganis. The Latino athletes traveling to Sidney, Australia, with
Team USA will likely excel in the sports you would expect _ boxing,
baseball and soccer. They will also participate and excel in events
in which Latinos aren't traditionally as strong _ sports such as
canoeing, kayaking and taekwondo. This article is excerpted from
Hispanic magazine. (slugged: BC-LATINO-OLYMPIANS-NEW-AMERICA-NYTSF)

   A FORMER MIGRANT WORKER REMEMBERS DRIVE-IN MOVIES. Columnist
Bill Maxwell laments the closing of St. Petersburg's remaining
outdoor movie theater _ the 28th Street Drive-In. Maxwell, who came
from a family of migrant workers, recalls his childhood love affair
with drive-in movie theaters. He writes: ``No matter where we
traveled, a drive-in was within driving distance. As black migrant
farm workers, we were always strangers ... Rarely were we welcomed
in indoor theaters. But drive-ins were different ... In a strange
way, the drive-in experience gave us dignity.'' (slugged:

   FEWER BLACK YOUTHS PURSUE BASEBALL CAREERS. ``These days, fewer
black kids are picking up bats and balls, and among those who do,
few are holding on to them into high school, college and the
pros,'' writes Kevin Blackistone, a columnist for Emerge magazine.
Why? There are more partial scholarships and fewer free rides
available on the baseball diamond. Kids and parents who are looking
to sports to finance a college education are more likely to pursue
football and basketball, where the chance of winning a full
scholarship is much greater. (slugged:

 By VALERIE MENARD 
 &HT;    Four years have passed since the last summer Olympics, and once
more it's time to experience the thrill of victory and agony of
defeat. Fortunately, Hispanic Americans can look forward to plenty
of thrills at this year's games.
 &HT;    The Latino athletes traveling to Sidney, Australia, with Team
USA will likely excel in the sports you would expect _ boxing,
baseball and soccer. They will also participate and excel in events
in which Latinos aren't traditionally as strong, sports such as
canoeing, kayaking and taekwondo.
 &HT;    Broadcast on NBC Sept. 15 - Oct. 1, the summer games will
showcase several Latino athletes favored to take home gold medals.
Leading the pack is diver Mark Ruiz. A native of Puerto Rico, Ruiz
has already been described as the heir apparent to diving great
Greg Louganis. At age 17, Ruiz did not make the Olympic team in
1996, but has since matured _ and so has his diving.
 &HT;    In 1999, Ruiz became the first diver since Louganis to sweep the
U.S. National Diving Championships by finishing in first place in
the one-, three-, and ten-meter platform diving competitions. In
international competition, his best finish was in 1999 when he won
the gold medal in the three-meter event.
 &HT;    Another Latino diver to watch is Rioger ``Rio'' Ramirez, 26.
Ramirez emigrated from Cuba in 1993 and became a U.S. citizen last
year. There may be a glitch, however. Even if he makes the U.S.
team, according to international rules, he will need to get
permission from Cuba to dive for the United States.
 &HT;    Several Latinos are sure to end up on the baseball team, too.
For the first time, the team will not be made up exclusively of
college players, but that doesn't mean Sammy Sosa or Livan
Hernandez will play. The U.S. Olympic baseball team will be made up
of minor leaguers currently playing in major league farm teams. As
yet, no players have been chosen, but Dave Fanucchi of USA Baseball
says that a team made up of top minor-league players debuted at the
Pan Am Games last year and included Latino left-handed pitcher J.
C. Romero. The team lost to Cuba in the gold-medal round. Now a
member of the Minnesota Twins, Romero may decide not to join the
team.
 &HT;    In women's softball, Team USA will again feature veteran players
and members of the gold-medal team from 1996 such as pitcher Lisa
Fernandez. A double-threat, Fernandez, 29, has an earned-run
average as a pitcher _ at the Canada Cup last year she was 3-0 with
40 strikeouts and a 0.00 ERA. Her batting abilities are also
impressive; Fenandez's batting average was .348 at the Canada Cup.
 &HT;    There will also be some newcomers. Shortstop Crystal Bustos, 23,
makes her first appearance in an Olympic competition. She compiled
a batting average of .385 at the U.S. Olympic Cup last year, and
batted .439 at the Pan Am Games. This will be the second year that
softball is an Olympic sport, and Team USA is expected to repeat
its gold medal performance.
 &HT;    The two remaining top sports for Latinos, soccer and boxing,
will again include Latino competitors. In a show of strength,
Soccer USA earned a slot in this year's Olympics _ in which only
two teams per continent can participate _ by beating Guatemala
soundly in April. Look for Ramiro Corrales on the men's team and
Kate Sobrero on the women's team.
 &HT;    The members of this year's U.S. boxing team have been selected
and include two players _ featherweight Ricardo Juarez and
bantamweight Carlos Navarro. Three Latino players made the team in
1996, but none won a medal. Unbeaten in over 60 bouts and a world
champion in 1999, Juarez is a strong favorite. Navarro was a silver
medalist at the Pan Am games and should do well. According to U.S.
boxing team spokesman Kevin Neuemdorf, both players are medal
hopefuls.
 &HT;    Perhaps the most interesting story for Latino athletes in the
Olympics is that they have emerged in several nontraditional
sports. Lisa Arce hopes to make the beach volleyball team, Armando
Ayala is a strong contender for the shooting team. Jeanette Antoifn
may become the first Latina gymnast to earn a medal (Trent Dimas
was the first Latino in 1992), and Angel Perez and Julia Sorzano
may compete in sprint kayaking events.
 &HT;    The most surprising development is the number of Latinos who are
contending for the first taekwondo team to compete as an official
medal sport at the Olympics. A family of Lopezes is listed among
several contenders _ Diana, Steven and Mark. The others are Juan
Moreno, Sabrina Alaquinez, Guillermo Mosquera, Jason Torres and
Peter Lopez. Coached by their brother Jean, all three are strong
medal contenders. Steven leads the pack in the featherweight
division. Flyweight Torres is also favored to win a medal.
 &HT;    Other Latino contenders for Team USA in Sydney are: Celita Shutz
in judo (she also participated in the last summer games); Marcelo
Arrue, Johnathan Bairos, Tinker Judrez and Mariano Friedick in
cycling, Mary Joe Fernandez and Kristina Brandi in tennis,
returning player Gavin Arroyo, Tony Azevedo, Ellen Estes and Brenda
Villa in water polo, and David Zuniga in wrestling. Eric Albarricin
and Michael Santos are in the running to make the wrestling team.
 &HT;    It promises to be fun watching first-time Hispanic American
Olympians and former medalists converging in Sidney as part of Team
USA.
 &HT;    May they all make it to the podium.

A FORMER MIGRANT WORKER REMEMBERS DRIVE-IN MOVIES

 By BILL MAXWELL  
 &HT;    If you are a Pinellas County resident nostalgic for drive-in
theaters, you had better unfold that rumble seat, rinse out that
favorite thermos and truck out to 4990 28th St. North. On June 30,
the St. Petersburg's remaining outdoor movie theater _ the 28th
Street Drive-In _ will not see another moonlit, starry night. Gone,
too, will be those steamy car windows. Remember them?
 &HT;    The 50-year-old theater is shutting down forever.
 &HT;    The land it is on has been sold to the School Board. Citing
stricter zoning laws, high land prices and a shortage of large
tracts of land, Harold Spears, president of the company that owns
the theater, told the St. Petersburg Times that ``it is practically
impossible to build a new drive-in theater today.''
 &HT;    I, like thousands of other Floridians, fondly remember the
drive-in theater. In fact, my family, many of my childhood
acquaintances and I had a love affair with the drive-in. I grew up
in the 1950s and early 1960s as a migrant farm worker. Each year, I
followed my family and others from South Florida to Virginia,
Delaware, New Jersey, upstate New York, Michigan and back to
Florida. We harvested melons, potatoes, tomatoes, beans, apples and
cherries. We rarely stayed in one place longer than two months.
 &HT;    We worked hard, often six days a week, from first light to last.
But at the week's end, everyone _ old men and women, teenagers on
hormones and young children _ knew that a great reward awaited us
down the road or in a neighboring town: the drive-in theater.
 &HT;    Indeed, no matter where we traveled, a drive-in was within
driving distance. As black migrant farm workers, we were always
strangers. Few local blacks wanted us in their part of town and, of
course, no whites wanted anything to do with us. We always lived in
migrant camps or in designated sites out of town.
 &HT;    Rarely were we welcomed in indoor theaters. But drive-ins were
different. Each Saturday or Sunday night, no matter where we were _
Hastings, Fla., Raleigh, N.C., Exmore, Va., Dover, Del., Long
Island, N.Y. _ we found a Sunset or a Starlite or a Sky-Vue or some
other named drive-in.
 &HT;    And we were a sight to behold: dozens of migrants in a caravan
of old pickups and beat-up Buicks, Chevys, Fords and Pontiacs
pulling up to the entrance of a theater. The owners loved our
hard-earned bucks, and we loved the amenities of the outdoor
theater.
 &HT;    The movies, always awful, were a wondrous respite from the daily
toil in the fields, orchards and groves. The cherry Cokes, the hot
dogs and burgers, the candy bars, the popcorn and other treats made
us feel as if we were part of the human race after all.
 &HT;    ``Drive-in night,'' as we called it, was the one time that we
dressed up and put on perfume or cologne. The concession stand gave
us our one real opportunity to mingle with the local residents. At
the stand, the locals seemed to forgive us for being ``dirty
outsiders'' as we forgave them, at least temporarily, for having
snubbed us during the rest of the week.
 &HT;    In a strange way, the drive-in experience gave us dignity. All
week, as we sweated in the hot sun, ate our meals in the fields,
rested under trees or beneath truck beds or wagons, we laughed and
talked about the latest stupid zombie or biker movie we had seen.
 &HT;    The drive-in, always reasonably priced, fortified us like
nothing else could.
 &HT;    Each weekday was one day closer to drive-in night. Even now, I
believe that knowing we were going to the drive-in at week's end
made farm work bearable, at least for the children. The movies also
gave our parents some greatly needed time away from their energetic
offspring. More than a few future fieldhands were conceived on
drive-in night.
 &HT;    So, if you remember drive-ins fondly and want to re-create that
old under-the-sky feeling, time is running out in Pinellas County
and the rest of the country. Short of physically going to a
drive-in, the best ticket these days may be the vicarious
experience found on drive-in Web sites and in books.
 &HT;    Me, I prefer books. The best on the market on this subject are
written by husband-and-wife team Don and Susan Sanders. Published
in 1997, their first such book, ``The American Drive-In Movie
Theatre,'' is a colorful work that covers nearly every aspect of
the industry. Some of the photographs, such as those of lovers
making-out on the front seat of their car or those juicy hot dogs
dripping with mustard, make you go back in time.
 &HT;    Their second book, ``Drive-In Movie Memories,'' is a wonderful
collection of the personal experiences of writers nationwide. A
version of my experiences above is published in Memories.
 &HT;    I say goodbye to the 28th Street Drive-In with a lump in my
throat. This old under-the-star-emporium, like others nationwide,
was a valuable piece of Americana that will not be forgotten.

`PAPAL SIN' OFFERS HOPE FOR GAYS, CATHOLIC CHURCH

 By CHUCK COLBERT  
 &HT;    Let's hope that a new book by a highly respected religious and
cultural conservative provides a wake-up call for Roman Catholics
in America, as well as for church officials in the Vatican.
 &HT;    Gary Wills, a devout Catholic, Pulitzer Prize-winning author and
adjunct professor of history at Northwestern University, has just
published ``Papal Sin,'' a blistering attack on the papacy and its
``structures of deceit.''
 &HT;    One does not have to be Catholic _ or gay for that matter _ to
be disgusted, if not infuriated, by the multiple webs of
intellectual dishonesty, distortions of ecclesiastical history,
theological arrogance and papal bullying that Wills exposes with
his no-holds-barred, stinging indictment of the modern papacy.
 &HT;    Wills' book suggests that John Paul II is an intellectual and
spiritual embarrassment, if not disgrace, to Catholics and the
church. His book challenges the pope on church doctrine, including
masturbation, contraception, women in the priesthood, homosexuality
and mandatory celibacy, among other teachings.
 &HT;    I met Mr. Wills recently when I attended a book reading at the
Brattle Theatre in Cambridge, Mass. _ not far from the Weston
Jesuit School of Theology, where I am a lay graduate student in
divinity.
 &HT;    ``Book reading'' is a misnomer. The author did not read from
``Papal Sin.'' Rather, Wills answered a series of questions from
the audience, explaining that he is not angry withor attackingthe
church. After all, Wills says, the church is the people of God.
 &HT;    In fact, Wills enjoys participating in the liturgical life of
the church and still upholds Catholicism's essential creeds and
saving truths, including the Trinity, the Incarnation and the
Resurrection.
 &HT;    I am as convinced that Wills has no quarrel with the people of
God as I am struck by his vigorous disagreements with this pope.
 &HT;    Wills writes: ``The pope alone, we are now asked to accept, is
competent to tell Christian people how to live. No one else can
have any say in the matter _ not a council, not the college of all
bishops, not the national synods of bishops, not the Christian
people. The Holy Spirit now speaks to only one person on earth, the
omnicompetent head of the church, a church that is all head and no
limbs. If that were so, then the body of Christ would be shamefully
reduced.''
 &HT;    During his recent visit to Cambridge, I asked Wills what hope he
saw for the church and someone like me _ an out gay Catholic with a
life partner. The church teaches that gay sex is sinful; therefore,
gay people must remain celibate for life, with no possibility of
intimate, loving, long-term, committed relationships.
 &HT;    I explained to Wills that while he may not be angry with church
officials, I am angered when priests and members of the hierarchy
hurl insults at me and inject misinformation into the public debate
about homosexuality and the gay civil-rights struggle.
 &HT;    I offered one example of insult that came from a Polish priest,
who said recently that ``homosexuals are rich, from rich families''
and they ``do nothing other than travel throughout the world,
flaunting their sickness.''
 &HT;    Closer to home, I offered the example of 16 Catholic bishops in
New England who issued a statement earlier this month slamming the
Vermont state legislature for passing a civil-union law for gay
couples. The law, set to take effect on July 1, grants the legal
benefits of marriage at the state level.
 &HT;    ``Such legislation will undermine cultural and religious respect
for marriage'' wrote the bishops in a statement issued by Bernard
Cardinal Law, Archbishop of Boston. The statement even accuses the
Vermont legislature of ``prepar(ing) the way for an attack on the
well-being of society itself.''
 &HT;    It also rankles me that few, if any, gay priests _ not an
insignificant number _ speak out against such blatant slander and
insolence. Wills said that today, the priesthood is between 40
percent to 80 percent gay. ``If that's not true, it's trending that
way,'' he added.
 &HT;    Despite Wills' criticism of the papacy, he holds out hope for
the future. To be honest, I don't fully share his optimism. I
don't, for example, hold much hopein the near future for honesty
and truth telling about homosexuality and gay people in the public
sphere _ at least from priests and bishops, let alone officials in
the Vatican.
 &HT;    But Wills' courageous truth-telling does give me hope. Although
he didn't answer my questions directly, his words were inspiring _
just what the Catholic Church needs to hear. ``I credit you, an
open gay Catholic,'' he said.
 &HT;    For this sort of honesty we don't have to wait for a new pope.
``Start telling the truth,'' he added.
 &HT;    Now there's a hopeful call to action.

 By KEVIN BLACKISTONE  
 &HT;    Erick Strickland was a throwback athlete during his high school
days in Bellevue, Neb. Unlike most kids, he didn't just concentrate
on one sport. Unlike most black kids, he included baseball in his
repertoire.
 &HT;    Strickland became a first team All-Nebraska performer in
basketball, football and baseball. He was recruited in each sport
by the most famous college sports programs in the country. The New
York Yankees even offered to make the 6-foot-3-inch, 220-pound
outfielder a first-round draft pick right out of high school if he
would forget about his other athletic interests and focus on
baseball. Strickland decided otherwise.
 &HT;    He accepted a basketball scholarship to Nebraska, where he led
the Cornhuskers to the National Invitation Tournament title in
1996, was named that tournament's MVP and earned a degree in
sociology.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, he was drafted by the Florida Marlins' baseball
organization and spent his summers playing in the Marlins'
minor-league system. Some of his minor-league teammates, such as
Edgar Renteria and Luis Castillo, graduated to the Marlins'
major-league club that won the World Series in 1997.
 &HT;    By then, however, Strickland was playing only basketball.
Despite not being drafted by an NBA team, he made the Dallas
Mavericks' roster. He signed a six-year contract with the team in
August 1997 and hasn't thought about baseball since.
 &HT;    ``My heart wasn't in it,'' Strickland admits.
 &HT;    These days, fewer black kids are picking up bats and balls, and
among those who do, few are holding on to them into high school,
college and the pros.
 &HT;    Last year, the Northeastern University Center for the Study of
Sport in Society reported that the 3 percent participation rate of
black players in major-league baseball was at a 10-year low. The
center also reports that the participation rate of black players in
Division I college baseball is 3 percent, based on 1996-97 figures.
 &HT;    Major-league baseball, which just three years ago patted itself
on the back for having allowed Jackie Robinson to break its color
barrier in 1947, is on the verge of becoming a predominately Latino
sport.
 &HT;    Strickland, 26, says he was lucky to have played baseball at
all. As an Air Force brat who moved around the country, he was
afforded the opportunity that other black kids in urban areas were
not.
 &HT;    ``In the inner city, it's harder to play baseball because you
don't have fields; you don't have places to play,'' Strickland
says. ``Growing up in small towns, growing up in the communities I
did, we had fields and opportunities to play baseball. In the inner
city, kids have basketball courts. It depends on where you live.''
 &HT;    Strickland also admits that he was always more attracted to
sports other than baseball. ``I think in baseball, it doesn't seem
like there's a sense of being involved throughout the whole game,''
he says. ``It seems kind of boring.''
 &HT;    Dennis Poppe, who oversees the college baseball championship
tournament at the NCAA, says the popularity and publicity of
basketball and football has hurt baseball's appeal.
 &HT;    ``I've heard the statement that the slam dunk is more popular,''
Poppe says. ``It could be that.''
 &HT;    Basketball and football certainly are more popular in the
media's eye. On any fall or winter evening, for example, a college
basketball game can be found on television. On any fall or winter
weekend, a college football game can be seen on TV.
 &HT;    The NCAA has a tough time selling baseball to broadcasters,
though, because the games can take three or four hours, and the
threat of cancellation because of weather is always looming, Poppe
says.
 &HT;    Another reason kids of all colors may lean toward football and
basketball is a very practical one: scholarships.
 &HT;    ``We're limited in the numbers of grants-in-aid we give in
baseball compared to other sports,'' Poppe explains.
 &HT;    There are more partial scholarships and fewer free rides
available on the baseball diamond. Kids and parents looking to
sports to finance a college education are more likely to pursue
football and basketball, where the chance of winning a full
scholarship is much greater.
 &HT;    The NCAA is not sitting idly as fewer black kids pursue
baseball. During the College World Series, it holds free clinics,
though not race specific, in the hopes of luring young people to
the diamond.
 &HT;    For several years now, major-league baseball has operated urban
programs specifically to ignite the passion that black kids once
had for the game, as well as to attract new customers for the 21st
century. All in all, though, they are pitches that aren't finding
the mark with black kids.

LATINO ATHLETES GO FOR SUMMER OLYMPIC GOLD

 By VALERIE MENARD 
 &HT;    Four years have passed since the last summer Olympics, and once
more it's time to experience the thrill of victory and agony of
defeat. Fortunately, Hispanic Americans can look forward to plenty
of thrills at this year's games.
 &HT;    The Latino athletes traveling to Sidney, Australia, with Team
USA will likely excel in the sports you would expect _ boxing,
baseball and soccer. They will also participate and excel in events
in which Latinos aren't traditionally as strong, sports such as
canoeing, kayaking and taekwondo.
 &HT;    Broadcast on NBC Sept. 15 - Oct. 1, the summer games will
showcase several Latino athletes favored to take home gold medals.
Leading the pack is diver Mark Ruiz. A native of Puerto Rico, Ruiz
has already been described as the heir apparent to diving great
Greg Louganis. At age 17, Ruiz did not make the Olympic team in
1996, but has since matured _ and so has his diving.
 &HT;    In 1999, Ruiz became the first diver since Louganis to sweep the
U.S. National Diving Championships by finishing in first place in
the one-, three-, and ten-meter platform diving competitions. In
international competition, his best finish was in 1999 when he won
the gold medal in the three-meter event.
 &HT;    Another Latino diver to watch is Rioger ``Rio'' Ramirez, 26.
Ramirez emigrated from Cuba in 1993 and became a U.S. citizen last
year. There may be a glitch, however. Even if he makes the U.S.
team, according to international rules, he will need to get
permission from Cuba to dive for the United States.
 &HT;    Several Latinos are sure to end up on the baseball team, too.
For the first time, the team will not be made up exclusively of
college players, but that doesn't mean Sammy Sosa or Livan
Hernandez will play. The U.S. Olympic baseball team will be made up
of minor leaguers currently playing in major league farm teams. As
yet, no players have been chosen, but Dave Fanucchi of USA Baseball
says that a team made up of top minor-league players debuted at the
Pan Am Games last year and included Latino left-handed pitcher J.
C. Romero. The team lost to Cuba in the gold-medal round. Now a
member of the Minnesota Twins, Romero may decide not to join the
team.
 &HT;    In women's softball, Team USA will again feature veteran players
and members of the gold-medal team from 1996 such as pitcher Lisa
Fernandez. A double-threat, Fernandez, 29, has an earned-run
average as a pitcher _ at the Canada Cup last year she was 3-0 with
40 strikeouts and a 0.00 ERA. Her batting abilities are also
impressive; Fenandez's batting average was .348 at the Canada Cup.
 &HT;    There will also be some newcomers. Shortstop Crystal Bustos, 23,
makes her first appearance in an Olympic competition. She compiled
a batting average of .385 at the U.S. Olympic Cup last year, and
batted .439 at the Pan Am Games. This will be the second year that
softball is an Olympic sport, and Team USA is expected to repeat
its gold medal performance.
 &HT;    The two remaining top sports for Latinos, soccer and boxing,
will again include Latino competitors. In a show of strength,
Soccer USA earned a slot in this year's Olympics _ in which only
two teams per continent can participate _ by beating Guatemala
soundly in April. Look for Ramiro Corrales on the men's team and
Kate Sobrero on the women's team.
 &HT;    The members of this year's U.S. boxing team have been selected
and include two players _ featherweight Ricardo Juarez and
bantamweight Carlos Navarro. Three Latino players made the team in
1996, but none won a medal. Unbeaten in over 60 bouts and a world
champion in 1999, Juarez is a strong favorite. Navarro was a silver
medalist at the Pan Am games and should do well. According to U.S.
boxing team spokesman Kevin Neuemdorf, both players are medal
hopefuls.
 &HT;    Perhaps the most interesting story for Latino athletes in the
Olympics is that they have emerged in several nontraditional
sports. Lisa Arce hopes to make the beach volleyball team, Armando
Ayala is a strong contender for the shooting team. Jeanette Antoifn
may become the first Latina gymnast to earn a medal (Trent Dimas
was the first Latino in 1992), and Angel Perez and Julia Sorzano
may compete in sprint kayaking events.
 &HT;    The most surprising development is the number of Latinos who are
contending for the first taekwondo team to compete as an official
medal sport at the Olympics. A family of Lopezes is listed among
several contenders _ Diana, Steven and Mark. The others are Juan
Moreno, Sabrina Alaquinez, Guillermo Mosquera, Jason Torres and
Peter Lopez. Coached by their brother Jean, all three are strong
medal contenders. Steven leads the pack in the featherweight
division. Flyweight Torres is also favored to win a medal.
 &HT;    Other Latino contenders for Team USA in Sydney are: Celita Shutz
in judo (she also participated in the last summer games); Marcelo
Arrue, Johnathan Bairos, Tinker Judrez and Mariano Friedick in
cycling, Mary Joe Fernandez and Kristina Brandi in tennis,
returning player Gavin Arroyo, Tony Azevedo, Ellen Estes and Brenda
Villa in water polo, and David Zuniga in wrestling. Eric Albarricin
and Michael Santos are in the running to make the wrestling team.
 &HT;    It promises to be fun watching first-time Hispanic American
Olympians and former medalists converging in Sidney as part of Team
USA.
 &HT;    May they all make it to the podium.

 By BILL MAXWELL  
 &HT;    If you are a Pinellas County resident nostalgic for drive-in
theaters, you had better unfold that rumble seat, rinse out that
favorite thermos and truck out to 4990 28th St. North. On June 30,
the St. Petersburg's remaining outdoor movie theater _ the 28th
Street Drive-In _ will not see another moonlit, starry night. Gone,
too, will be those steamy car windows. Remember them?
 &HT;    The 50-year-old theater is shutting down forever.
 &HT;    The land it is on has been sold to the School Board. Citing
stricter zoning laws, high land prices and a shortage of large
tracts of land, Harold Spears, president of the company that owns
the theater, told the St. Petersburg Times that ``it is practically
impossible to build a new drive-in theater today.''
 &HT;    I, like thousands of other Floridians, fondly remember the
drive-in theater. In fact, my family, many of my childhood
acquaintances and I had a love affair with the drive-in. I grew up
in the 1950s and early 1960s as a migrant farm worker. Each year, I
followed my family and others from South Florida to Virginia,
Delaware, New Jersey, upstate New York, Michigan and back to
Florida. We harvested melons, potatoes, tomatoes, beans, apples and
cherries. We rarely stayed in one place longer than two months.
 &HT;    We worked hard, often six days a week, from first light to last.
But at the week's end, everyone _ old men and women, teenagers on
hormones and young children _ knew that a great reward awaited us
down the road or in a neighboring town: the drive-in theater.
 &HT;    Indeed, no matter where we traveled, a drive-in was within
driving distance. As black migrant farm workers, we were always
strangers. Few local blacks wanted us in their part of town and, of
course, no whites wanted anything to do with us. We always lived in
migrant camps or in designated sites out of town.
 &HT;    Rarely were we welcomed in indoor theaters. But drive-ins were
different. Each Saturday or Sunday night, no matter where we were _
Hastings, Fla., Raleigh, N.C., Exmore, Va., Dover, Del., Long
Island, N.Y. _ we found a Sunset or a Starlite or a Sky-Vue or some
other named drive-in.
 &HT;    And we were a sight to behold: dozens of migrants in a caravan
of old pickups and beat-up Buicks, Chevys, Fords and Pontiacs
pulling up to the entrance of a theater. The owners loved our
hard-earned bucks, and we loved the amenities of the outdoor
theater.
 &HT;    The movies, always awful, were a wondrous respite from the daily
toil in the fields, orchards and groves. The cherry Cokes, the hot
dogs and burgers, the candy bars, the popcorn and other treats made
us feel as if we were part of the human race after all.
 &HT;    ``Drive-in night,'' as we called it, was the one time that we
dressed up and put on perfume or cologne. The concession stand gave
us our one real opportunity to mingle with the local residents. At
the stand, the locals seemed to forgive us for being ``dirty
outsiders'' as we forgave them, at least temporarily, for having
snubbed us during the rest of the week.
 &HT;    In a strange way, the drive-in experience gave us dignity. All
week, as we sweated in the hot sun, ate our meals in the fields,
rested under trees or beneath truck beds or wagons, we laughed and
talked about the latest stupid zombie or biker movie we had seen.
 &HT;    The drive-in, always reasonably priced, fortified us like
nothing else could.
 &HT;    Each weekday was one day closer to drive-in night. Even now, I
believe that knowing we were going to the drive-in at week's end
made farm work bearable, at least for the children. The movies also
gave our parents some greatly needed time away from their energetic
offspring. More than a few future fieldhands were conceived on
drive-in night.
 &HT;    So, if you remember drive-ins fondly and want to re-create that
old under-the-sky feeling, time is running out in Pinellas County
and the rest of the country. Short of physically going to a
drive-in, the best ticket these days may be the vicarious
experience found on drive-in Web sites and in books.
 &HT;    Me, I prefer books. The best on the market on this subject are
written by husband-and-wife team Don and Susan Sanders. Published
in 1997, their first such book, ``The American Drive-In Movie
Theatre,'' is a colorful work that covers nearly every aspect of
the industry. Some of the photographs, such as those of lovers
making-out on the front seat of their car or those juicy hot dogs
dripping with mustard, make you go back in time.
 &HT;    Their second book, ``Drive-In Movie Memories,'' is a wonderful
collection of the personal experiences of writers nationwide. A
version of my experiences above is published in Memories.
 &HT;    I say goodbye to the 28th Street Drive-In with a lump in my
throat. This old under-the-star-emporium, like others nationwide,
was a valuable piece of Americana that will not be forgotten.

`PAPAL SIN' OFFERS HOPE FOR GAYS, CATHOLIC CHURCH

 By CHUCK COLBERT  
 &HT;    Let's hope that a new book by a highly respected religious and
cultural conservative provides a wake-up call for Roman Catholics
in America, as well as for church officials in the Vatican.
 &HT;    Gary Wills, a devout Catholic, Pulitzer Prize-winning author and
adjunct professor of history at Northwestern University, has just
published ``Papal Sin,'' a blistering attack on the papacy and its
``structures of deceit.''
 &HT;    One does not have to be Catholic _ or gay for that matter _ to
be disgusted, if not infuriated, by the multiple webs of
intellectual dishonesty, distortions of ecclesiastical history,
theological arrogance and papal bullying that Wills exposes with
his no-holds-barred, stinging indictment of the modern papacy.
 &HT;    Wills' book suggests that John Paul II is an intellectual and
spiritual embarrassment, if not disgrace, to Catholics and the
church. His book challenges the pope on church doctrine, including
masturbation, contraception, women in the priesthood, homosexuality
and mandatory celibacy, among other teachings.
 &HT;    I met Mr. Wills recently when I attended a book reading at the
Brattle Theatre in Cambridge, Mass. _ not far from the Weston
Jesuit School of Theology, where I am a lay graduate student in
divinity.
 &HT;    ``Book reading'' is a misnomer. The author did not read from
``Papal Sin.'' Rather, Wills answered a series of questions from
the audience, explaining that he is not angry withor attackingthe
church. After all, Wills says, the church is the people of God.
 &HT;    In fact, Wills enjoys participating in the liturgical life of
the church and still upholds Catholicism's essential creeds and
saving truths, including the Trinity, the Incarnation and the
Resurrection.
 &HT;    I am as convinced that Wills has no quarrel with the people of
God as I am struck by his vigorous disagreements with this pope.
 &HT;    Wills writes: ``The pope alone, we are now asked to accept, is
competent to tell Christian people how to live. No one else can
have any say in the matter _ not a council, not the college of all
bishops, not the national synods of bishops, not the Christian
people. The Holy Spirit now speaks to only one person on earth, the
omnicompetent head of the church, a church that is all head and no
limbs. If that were so, then the body of Christ would be shamefully
reduced.''
 &HT;    During his recent visit to Cambridge, I asked Wills what hope he
saw for the church and someone like me _ an out gay Catholic with a
life partner. The church teaches that gay sex is sinful; therefore,
gay people must remain celibate for life, with no possibility of
intimate, loving, long-term, committed relationships.
 &HT;    I explained to Wills that while he may not be angry with church
officials, I am angered when priests and members of the hierarchy
hurl insults at me and inject misinformation into the public debate
about homosexuality and the gay civil-rights struggle.
 &HT;    I offered one example of insult that came from a Polish priest,
who said recently that ``homosexuals are rich, from rich families''
and they ``do nothing other than travel throughout the world,
flaunting their sickness.''
 &HT;    Closer to home, I offered the example of 16 Catholic bishops in
New England who issued a statement earlier this month slamming the
Vermont state legislature for passing a civil-union law for gay
couples. The law, set to take effect on July 1, grants the legal
benefits of marriage at the state level.
 &HT;    ``Such legislation will undermine cultural and religious respect
for marriage'' wrote the bishops in a statement issued by Bernard
Cardinal Law, Archbishop of Boston. The statement even accuses the
Vermont legislature of ``prepar(ing) the way for an attack on the
well-being of society itself.''
 &HT;    It also rankles me that few, if any, gay priests _ not an
insignificant number _ speak out against such blatant slander and
insolence. Wills said that today, the priesthood is between 40
percent to 80 percent gay. ``If that's not true, it's trending that
way,'' he added.
 &HT;    Despite Wills' criticism of the papacy, he holds out hope for
the future. To be honest, I don't fully share his optimism. I
don't, for example, hold much hopein the near future for honesty
and truth telling about homosexuality and gay people in the public
sphere _ at least from priests and bishops, let alone officials in
the Vatican.
 &HT;    But Wills' courageous truth-telling does give me hope. Although
he didn't answer my questions directly, his words were inspiring _
just what the Catholic Church needs to hear. ``I credit you, an
open gay Catholic,'' he said.
 &HT;    For this sort of honesty we don't have to wait for a new pope.
``Start telling the truth,'' he added.
 &HT;    Now there's a hopeful call to action.

 By KEVIN BLACKISTONE  
 &HT;    Erick Strickland was a throwback athlete during his high school
days in Bellevue, Neb. Unlike most kids, he didn't just concentrate
on one sport. Unlike most black kids, he included baseball in his
repertoire.
 &HT;    Strickland became a first team All-Nebraska performer in
basketball, football and baseball. He was recruited in each sport
by the most famous college sports programs in the country. The New
York Yankees even offered to make the 6-foot-3-inch, 220-pound
outfielder a first-round draft pick right out of high school if he
would forget about his other athletic interests and focus on
baseball. Strickland decided otherwise.
 &HT;    He accepted a basketball scholarship to Nebraska, where he led
the Cornhuskers to the National Invitation Tournament title in
1996, was named that tournament's MVP and earned a degree in
sociology.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, he was drafted by the Florida Marlins' baseball
organization and spent his summers playing in the Marlins'
minor-league system. Some of his minor-league teammates, such as
Edgar Renteria and Luis Castillo, graduated to the Marlins'
major-league club that won the World Series in 1997.
 &HT;    By then, however, Strickland was playing only basketball.
Despite not being drafted by an NBA team, he made the Dallas
Mavericks' roster. He signed a six-year contract with the team in
August 1997 and hasn't thought about baseball since.
 &HT;    ``My heart wasn't in it,'' Strickland admits.
 &HT;    These days, fewer black kids are picking up bats and balls, and
among those who do, few are holding on to them into high school,
college and the pros.
 &HT;    Last year, the Northeastern University Center for the Study of
Sport in Society reported that the 3 percent participation rate of
black players in major-league baseball was at a 10-year low. The
center also reports that the participation rate of black players in
Division I college baseball is 3 percent, based on 1996-97 figures.
 &HT;    Major-league baseball, which just three years ago patted itself
on the back for having allowed Jackie Robinson to break its color
barrier in 194, is on the verge of becoming a predominately Latino
sport.
 &HT;    Strickland, 26, says he was lucky to have played baseball at
all. As an Air Force brat who moved around the country, he was
afforded the opportunity that other black kids in urban areas were
not.
 &HT;    ``In the inner city, it's harder to play baseball because you
don't have fields; you don't have places to play,'' Strickland
says. ``Growing up in small towns, growing up in the communities I
did, we had fields and opportunities to play baseball. In the inner
city, kids have basketball courts. It depends on where you live.''
 &HT;    Strickland also admits that he was always more attracted to
sports other than baseball. ``I think in baseball, it doesn't seem
like there's a sense of being involved throughout the whole game,''
he says. ``It seems kind of boring.''
 &HT;    Dennis Poppe, who oversees the college baseball championship
tournament at the NCAA, says the popularity and publicity of
basketball and football has hurt baseball's appeal.
 &HT;    ``I've heard the statement that the slam dunk is more popular,''
Poppe says. ``It could be that.''
 &HT;    Basketball and football certainly are more popular in the
media's eye. On any fall or winter evening, for example, a college
basketball game can be found on television. On any fall or winter
weekend, a college football game can be seen on TV.
 &HT;    The NCAA has a tough time selling baseball to broadcasters,
though, because the games can take three or four hours, and the
threat of cancellation because of weather is always looming, Poppe
says.
 &HT;    Another reason kids of all colors may lean toward football and
basketball is a very practical one: scholarships.
 &HT;    ``We're limited in the numbers of grants-in-aid we give in
baseball compared to other sports,'' Poppe explains.
 &HT;    There are more partial scholarships and fewer free rides
available on the baseball diamond. Kids and parents looking to
sports to finance a college education are more likely to pursue
football and basketball, where the chance of winning a full
scholarship is much greater.
 &HT;    The NCAA is not sitting idly as fewer black kids pursue
baseball. During the College World Series, it holds free clinics,
though not race specific, in the hopes of luring young people to
the diamond.
 &HT;    For several years now, major-league baseball has operated urban
programs specifically to ignite the passion that black kids once
had for the game, as well as to attract new customers for the 21st
century. All in all, though, they are pitches that aren't finding
the mark with black kids.

APPEALS COURT CLEARS WAY FOR ELIAN TO RETURN TO CUBA 
</HEADLINE>
   By JULIAN E. BARNES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A federal appeals court Friday rejected a request by Elian
Gonzalez's Miami relatives to reconsider a three judge panel's
refusal to grant the Cuban boy an asylum hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The decision clears a path for Elian to return home with his
father by next Wednesday, seven months after the boy was rescued
floating on an inner tube off the coast of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Miguel Gonzalez, the boy's father, is under a court order
not to remove his son from the United States. But unless the
Supreme Court issues an emergency stay, the appeals court said
Friday that it will issue a mandate at 4 p.m. Wednesday lifting the
court order barring Gonzalez from taking his son back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's Miami relatives, who took care of the boy after his
rescue, filed a petition seeking the rehearing on June 16. But even
then lawyers for the relatives expressed little hope the appellate
court would side with them. Instead they have said that they will
appeal the case to the U.S. Supreme Court and a seek an emergency
order to prevent Gonzalez from taking Elian to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   But such stays by the high court are extremely rare, because
justices must only issue them if they believe there is a
substantial likelihood of overturning a lower court decision.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's Miami relatives filed a legal motion on July 16 asking
the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta to rehear the
request for an asylum hearing for the 6-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service has repeatedly
said that only Juan Miguel Gonzalez has the right to request an
asylum hearing for his son. Since Elian was rescued, Gonzalez has
said that he wants to bring his son home to Cuba, and he has fought
attempts by Elian's great-uncle to win an asylum hearing for the
boy.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was one of only three survivors after the boat that he,
his mother and 13 others were in capsized. Elian's mother,
Elisabet, was trying to immigrate with her son to the United
States. She did not tell the boy's father, from whom she was
divorced, that she was taking him from Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   For Cubans on both sides of the Straits of Florida, Elian has
become a kind of political totem. In Cuba, Fidel Castro's Communist
government has organized demonstrations demanding Elian's
repatriation. In Miami, Cuban immigrants have held up the boy as a
symbol of freedom, and demanded that the U.S. government not allow
him to be returned to a totalitarian society.
</P>
<P>
   After his rescue, temporary custody of Elian was given to his
great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez, a Cuban immigrant who lives in Miami.
But Justice Department officials ordered Lazaro Gonzalez to give up
custody after Juan Miguel Gonzalez arrived in Washington, D.C. from
Cuba and agreed to stay until the legal battle over the boy was
resolved. When Lazaro Gonzalez balked at giving up the boy, armed
federal agents raided the Miami home on April 22, seized the boy
and returned him to his father.
</P>
<P>
   Since the raid, Elian has been in the Washington area, first at
a Maryland retreat and later at a home inside the city.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's Miami relatives have contended that the appellate panel
erred when it based its June 1 decision on a 1984 Supreme Court
decision that executive branch agencies, like the INS, are entitled
to wide discretion to interpret their own regulations. The Miami
relatives' lawyers said the court should instead look to a high
court decision from May 1 that said courts need not defer to
executive agencies' decisions that are not based on rules made in
formal procedures.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, the court rejected a Labor Department ruling that
said states could not require public employees to take compensatory
time off at specific times. Lawyers for Elian's Miami relatives
argued that case gave courts the power to overrule the INS.
</P>
<P>
   But the Justice Department has argued that the Miami relatives
are misinterpreting that court ruling, and that even if judges are
not obliged to defer to government agencies, they must not
substitute their interpretations of the law for an agency's.
</P>
<P>
   In a written opinion issued Friday, the appellate court said the
Supreme Court ruling did not apply, and even if it did the court
said that administrative decisions by the executive branch are
still due some deference.
</P>
<P>
   The appellate court decision can be found on the Internet at:

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I was filled with emotions and memories as I stepped off a bus
one afternoon earlier this month and looked up at that golden dome,
considered by many to be the most famous of college landmarks.
</P>
<P>
   It was appropriate that I was accompanied by my dear friend, Don
Hellinghausen of Midland. Don, then of Breckenridge, and I first
met more than 54 years ago as we ventured forth to attend the
University of Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   Together we had stepped out of a cab at the end of Notre Dame
Avenue and looked up at that golden dome. My emotions were far
different that September day in 1946 than they were this month.
</P>
<P>
   I was awe-struck as I looked at the campus for the first time. I
also was a little bit frightened _ but not homesick _ at the
challenges I would have to face without having a parent to turn to
for the first time in my life.
</P>
<P>
   I had dreamed of attending Notre Dame since I was 10. I had an
uncle and cousin who had attended the northern Indiana school and
was attracted by their stories of life at Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   Ours was not what one would consider a normal freshmen class. I
guess we numbered more than 1,500. Most of these freshmen were
World War II veterans. I was among the handful of non-veterans,
and, at 17, was among the youngest in the class.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the universities and colleges of the 1940s were quite
paternalistic. But the Holy Cross priests, who ran Notre Dame,
carried it to the extreme.
</P>
<P>
   Most students lived in dormitories. Freshmen had to be in their
dorm by 10 p.m. They were permitted to stay out until midnight one
night a week. Sophomores could stay out until midnight twice a
week, juniors three times a week and seniors every night of the
week.
</P>
<P>
   But anyone coming in after midnight paid a big price. I know of
at least one football star who was summarily tossed out of school
for trying to sneak through a dorm window at 1 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   It was in our freshman year in 1946 that the good fathers
decided to raise standards dramatically so that the university's
academic standings would more closely match those of the football
team.
</P>
<P>
   On top of all of this, those of us who lived on campus were not
permitted to have a car. You could be kicked out of school if you
were under 21 and caught partaking of any alcoholic beverage _ even
on St. Patrick's Day.
</P>
<P>
   We non-veterans took the tough discipline pretty much in stride.
But there was considerable _ and understandable _ grumbling in the
ranks of the veterans, many of whom had survived the horrors of
war.
</P>
<P>
   And it certainly would be difficult to enforce such edicts in
today's world. But our class survived them. In fact, they were
probably the right thing for our generation.
</P>
<P>
   The camaraderie was unbelievable. The fact that we were all
males who lived in dorms probably contributed to this. (Women were
not to be admitted for two more decades.)
</P>
<P>
   The athletes were granted no privilege other than the training
table during the season of their sports. They had to live among us.
They were treated as just one of the boys by the rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   Well almost.
</P>
<P>
   I had a special respect for Leon Hart, the first lineman (he was
an end) to win the Heisman trophy. He weighed more than 250 pounds
and was considered a giant of a player in those days.
</P>
<P>
   During the off-season, Leon had to take physical education, and
I had the misfortune of being on Leon's team. I also had the
misfortune of being a terrible basketball player.
</P>
<P>
   When Leon would get frustrated with my ineptness, he would pick
me up by the nape of my T-shirt (I weighed no more than 140) so he
could chastise me on an eye-to-eye basis.
</P>
<P>
   That first winter at Notre Dame was a killer for a boy from
Texas. Snow quickly lost the glamour of being a fun thing.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of the rigid discipline, the frigid winters and the
challenging curriculum, I quickly began a four-year love affair
with a special place called Notre Dame.

JAPAN'S DOCOMO CONSIDERS ENTERING BRITAIN'S WIRELESS MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ NTT DoCoMo Inc., Japan's leading wireless communications
company, dropped hints Friday that it may soon establish a presence
in Britain, a lucrative mobile phone market that would
significantly add to DoCoMo's increasingly fast-paced international
expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to press reports that DoCoMo was on the verge of
acquiring a stake in Telesystem International Wireless Inc., a
Canadian company that is heavily invested in the British market, a
senior DoCoMo executive acknowledged that a link with Telesystem
was an attractive option.
</P>
<P>
   The executive, Kiyoyuki Tsujimura, head of DoCoMo's global
business development division, also said a link with Orange, a big
British mobile phone company, was another attractive option.
</P>
<P>
   Tsujimura spoke after the Financial Times, Britain's leading
business daily, and Jiji Press, a Japanese wire service, both
reported that DoCoMo was about to spend 200 billion yen, or about
$1.8 billion, to buy a 15 percent stake in Telesystem.
</P>
<P>
   DoCoMo officials declined to confirm those reports, and the
Japanese company's stock fell 1 percent Friday to 3.01 million yen.
</P>
<P>
   DoCoMo owns 19 percent of Hutchinson Telecom, an affiliate of
the Hong Kong conglomerate Hutchinson Whampoa, which already has a
joint venture with Telesystem to develop a network to provide
mobile services in Britain. Telesystem recently spent $6.4 billion
for one of five new licenses to offer those services and now must
seek partners to help it make the capital investments needed to
exploit the license.
</P>
<P>
   A Telesystem investment would fit in with DoCoMo's strategy of
buying small stakes in foreign mobile phone operators to spread its
``i-mode'' service, the largest mobile Internet access service in
the world with 7 million subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   The company recently bought a 15 percent stake in KPN
Communications, a Dutch wireless operator, and is rumored to be in
negotiations with VoiceStream Wireless, a U.S. mobile phone
company, and SK Telecom, a Korean mobile phone company.
</P>
<P>
   Tsujimura also said DoCoMo could lease a network to avoid the
acquisition of expensive infrastructure at a time when providing
content and the technology to bring it to tiny phone screens is
looking like a more lucrative business.
</P>
<P>
   DoCoMo is suddenly moving fast to establish a beachhead in
Europe, home of the biggest immediate opportunities in the global
mobile market, because its i-mode technology will be matched by a
technology known as ``wireless application protocol'' or WAP,
within the next year or so.
</P>
<P>
   So far, i-mode enjoys an advantage over WAP, which uses a
different communication format than the Internet and thus requires
Web sites to write completely new programs to deliver their
contents over WAP-enabled mobile phones.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, i-mode uses the same communication format as the
Internet, making it relatively easy for Web sites to connect to
DoCoMo subscribers. But it was only available in Japan until last
month, when Hutchinson Telecom subscribers began to have access to
online racing car games from one of DoCoMo's Japanese content
providers.
</P>
<P>
   ``By sometime next year, the specifications for a new generation
of WAP fully compatible with the Internet will be out,'' Tsujimura
said. ``Then there will be no distinction between WAP and i-mode.''

FLOCK FLEES DINNER-PLATE FATE IN DELIGHTFUL `CHICKEN RUN' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL MULLER  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - One can only imagine the pitch meeting for ``Chicken
Run'':
</P>
<P>
   `Hey, let's remake ``The Great Escape,'' only with chickens.''
</P>
<P>
   Funny thing is, it works.
</P>
<P>
   The creators of BBC animation favorites Wallace &AMP; Gromit offer
up a delightful tale about a group of chickens trying to escape
from a bleak egg farm before their evil human owners turn them into
potpies.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's stop-motion animation is top-drawer. Done in
Plasticine (a cousin of Claymation), the chickens have wonderfully
expressive faces that run the gamut of emotions, from stark terror
to anger to elation. They cry when they're sad and sweat when
they're nervous, a la the sinister penguin from W&AMP;G's ``The Wrong
Trousers.''
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, the dialogue is so snappy and the pacing so
smooth that you really find yourself caring about what happens to
your new feathered friends, even if you've been known to frequent
KFC.
</P>
<P>
   The first part of the film is filled with references to ``The
Great'' ``Escape,'' the classic Steve McQueen movie about Allied
POWs in a German prison camp. The chickens dig tunnels, get thrown
into the cooler and even line up for their `commandant.''
</P>
<P>
   They also behave like chickens, panicking at a moment's notice
or attacking their chicken-feed trough with ravenous abandon.
</P>
<P>
   The story focuses on Ginger (voiced by Julia Sawalha), who is
smarter than your average chicken and convinces her cohorts that
there's more to life than laying eggs and ultimately ending up as a
Sunday dinner. She's joined by Rocky the Rooster (Mel Gibson), a
circus performer on the lam who agrees to help.
</P>
<P>
   Though Ginger routinely fails in her escape attempts, she
redoubles her efforts when she spies the delivery of a giant potpie
machine: a multigeared, clanking piece of hardware that oozes
foreboding.
</P>
<P>
   The farm is run by the fiendish Mrs. Tweedy (splendidly voiced
by Miranda Richardson), who browbeats Mr. Tweedy and tells him that
he's imagining things when he says the chickens are organizing a
breakout. There are some engaging secondary characters, including
two profiteering rats and an air-headed knitting chicken named Babs
(Jane Horrocks).
</P>
<P>
   The film retains the English wit found in Wallace &AMP; Gromit and
includes other trademarks from the popular animated shorts. There's
a well-synchronized dance number and several seamless action
sequences, including an uproarious scene in which the oversize
chickens try to learn to fly.
</P>
<P>
   The final sequence is imaginative and eye-catching. By then, as
funny as it sounds, you're really rooting for the chickens.

CITIBANK SEEKS MEXICAN COURT RULING ON PREPAID BAILOUT LOAN 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAN FINEREN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ The Mexican government is once again embroiled in
a borrowing problem with Citibank, resurrecting memories of the
Latin debt crisis two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   But this time Mexico is not late in its payments. Rather, the
bank says, Mexico has paid too early.
</P>
<P>
   It may seem odd that a bank would get upset if a borrower with a
legacy of financial instability wanted to pay off a debt early,
known in banking as a prepayment. But for Citibank, Mexico's
prepayment of a $2.5 billion loan means the bank loses hundreds of
millions of dollars in interest income it had assumed would flow in
during the next six years.
</P>
<P>
   For Mexico, the prepayment helps minimize the taxpayer cost of
salvaging the country's banking system, which is still burdened
with insolvencies.
</P>
<P>
   The government has been under intense fire from opposition
parties to curb the mushrooming cost of the bank bailout. And as
the Citibank debt was among the most costly on the books of the
government's bank bailout agency, the government said it decided to
repay now and save taxpayers at least $300 million.
</P>
<P>
   Citibank has insisted the prepayment is illegal and has gone to
a Mexican court to press its case, essentially arguing that Mexico
is not permitted to pay off the debt yet. The timing of the
dispute, coming just days before Mexico's presidential elections,
has made it a political issue.
</P>
<P>
   The government does not want to alienate foreign banks and other
overseas investors whose money is critical to Mexico's economic
stability. At the same time, no Mexican politician wants to be seen
as fearful of a big financial power like Citibank, which to many
Mexicans symbolizes the hold that the United States has
historically exerted over Mexico and other Latin American nations.
</P>
<P>
   It was Citibank, after all, that was among the most aggressive
American lenders to countries like Mexico and Brazil, which
struggled to renegotiate billions of dollars of delinquent debts in
the 1980s. The chief negotiator for American banks during that
crisis, William Rhodes, is a vice chairman at Citigroup, Citibank's
parent company.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's current dispute with Citibank revolves around
Citibank's May 1998 agreement with the government's bank bailout
agency, the Bank Savings Protection Institute, to buy Banca Confia,
a 230-branch commercial bank that had a history of bad management,
money laundering and corruption scandals.
</P>
<P>
   Citibank purchased Confia for $185 million on the understanding
that the government would assume $2.5 billion in Confia debt and
repay it to Citibank over eight years. This would provide Citibank
with about $120 million a year for the restoration of what Julio de
Quesada, the chief executive of Citibank's Mexico subsidiary,
called ``a broken bank.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, De Quesada called the debt a subsidy, ``an
integral part of the deal to compensate the bank for fixing
Confia.'' If the government had not assumed the debt, he said,
Citibank would not have bought Confia.
</P>
<P>
   The bank bailout agency, for its part, maintains that the Confia
agreement allows the agency to pay Citibank back at any time.
Vicente Corta, a lawyer who is executive secretary of the agency,
said it would never have made the prepayment without legal grounds
to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Some banking analysts agree. Lawrence Madsen, who follows the
banking industry for the investment firm UBS Warburg in Mexico
City, said that if the bank bailout agency had not researched the
legality of a prepayment, ``I really would be very surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   A Mexico City judge will hold a June 30 hearing on Citibank's
request for an injunction to stop the prepayment. It is unclear
what the next step in the legal process would be.
</P>
<P>
   But both Citibank and the bank bailout agency have pledged to
use all the legal tools at their disposal to defend their
positions.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers who have been following the case say the argument is
likely to center on whether the Confia sale documents specify that
Mexico's bank bailout agency can pay back the debt in advance.
</P>
<P>
   Citibank argues that the documents only allow the prepayment of
the total equity value of Confia, now worth about $137 million.
Corta of the bank bailout agency says there is no prohibition
against further payments. Citibank also argues that the bailout
agency violated the Mexican Constitution by assuming it is
empowered to act at all, because the Confia deal was signed by
another Mexican regulatory agency that no longer exists.
</P>
<P>
   Fauzi Hamdan, an opposition party legislator who presides over a
congressional committee overseeing Mexicos bank bailout, said the
bailout agency was acting within its legal rights.
</P>
<P>
   Citibank has also expressed anger over how the prepayment was
made, suggesting it was done deliberately to catch the bank off
guard.
</P>
<P>
   The bank bailout agency announced on the afternoon of May 4 that
the prepayment would be made at noon the following Monday. Because
May 5 was a public holiday, Citibank was not given the opportunity
to protest the payment.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Citibank's legal representatives hand delivered letters
to the houses of the bailout agency directors over the weekend,
explaining that it would be difficult to accept such a huge amount
of money at such short notice. The government responded by
splitting the payment in two _ nearly $1.1 billion on Monday, May
8, and the rest two days later.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers following the case said Citibank was unlikely to drop it
without a promise that Mexico will pay the lost interest. Corta
seems happy to leave it to the judge to decide.
</P>
<P>
   ``If at the end of the day they are in the right, we will pay
all that corresponds to them,'' Corta said. ``But if we are in the
right, then all we ask is that they accept the court's decision and
that they publicly declare that we always acted in accordance with
the law.''

LATEST CARREY FLICK IS SICK AND IT'S A SNOOZER, TOO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL MULLER  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Near the end of ``Me, Myself &AMP; Irene,'' Jim Carrey
beats himself up.
</P>
<P>
   Heaven knows he deserves it. It's fair punishment for starring
in this moronic farce, which lurches from tragically unfunny to
pointlessly raunchy with the grace of a drunken wildebeest.
</P>
<P>
   You have to give the movie some credit, though. It does manage
to offend almost every group, from ethnic minorities to women to
the mentally ill. It also throws in animal cruelty and child abuse,
just for a few more yuks.
</P>
<P>
   When I say this film is offensive, I don't mean it will make
your Aunt Tilly blush. This stuff would have Chris Rock shaking his
head and saying, ``Guys, I just don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, this is a Farrelly brothers movie, and they are gross-out
kings. But in their other films (`There's Something About Mary,`
`Kingpin,` `Dumb and Dumber`), some of the raunchy sight gags were
funny. In this one, they're just cruel, gratuitous and sad.
</P>
<P>
   Carrey plays a Rhode Island state trooper named Charlie whose
wife gives birth to three African-American children after having an
affair with a limo driver (who, for no reason at all, is played by
a midget). After she leaves the kids with Charlie, he snaps and
develops an alter ego named Hank.
</P>
<P>
   Hank is a hilarious prankster, dunking children in water
fountains, relieving himself on his neighbor's lawn and assaulting
women on park benches. If none of this sounds funny, it's because
it's not.
</P>
<P>
   The movie just keeps giving you reasons to hate it. If it's not
the insipid ``Dukes of Hazzard'' narration, it's the syrupy score,
which is selection A7 on the Jukebox from Hell. Either that, or The
Captain and Tennille are getting work again.
</P>
<P>
   As for Charlie's grown kids, their chief job seems to be
repeating the same profane phrase over and over again. It's almost
like they're having a contest.
</P>
<P>
   There's also the inane plot, which has Charlie hooking up with
Irene (Renee Zellweger) and chasing around after crooked cops. We
never find out why, but that's OK, because explaining it would make
this movie longer, and nothing is worth that.
</P>
<P>
   Just when you think the movie is only out to offend, it proves
it can be boring, too. If the Farrellys had one shred of human
decency, they would have issued suicide capsules.
</P>
<P>
   But no, we must press on, as the movie turns into a lovey-dovey
road picture with all the charm of a rabid pit bull. There's no
chemistry at all between Carrey and Zellweger, who plays the part
as if she's been hit on the head with a large object.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his rubber-faced gifts, Carrey isn't very creative in
distinguishing his alter egos. He just gives Hank a gravelly voice
and a potty mouth.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, when both personalities inhabit Carrey's body, he
throws himself out of a moving car.
</P>
<P>
   Now that's entertainment.

   BKN-DRAFT-MIHM _ AUSTIN _ Orlando Magic General Manager John
Gabriel has two words for those who would dismiss Chris Mihm
offhand as unfit to play center effectively in the NBA. Brad
Daugherty. Gabriel considers Daugherty a cautionary tale for those
taking measure of NBA draft prospects. Daugherty, a college star at
North Carolina in the mid-1980s, was widely considered to lack the
toughness necessary to work near the basket as a pro. As NBA scouts
took measure of him, Daugherty was tattooed with the ``S'' word _
too soft. Based on that reputation, Philadelphia, which had the No.
1 pick in the 1986 draft, traded it to Cleveland. As it turned out,
Daugherty became one of the better centers in the NBA. Using skill
and athleticism more than muscle and intimidation, Daugherty became
a five-time all-star, averaging 19 points a game before his career
was cut short after eight seasons because of a back injury.
Gabriel, voted the NBA's top executive this season, says, ``I think
you have to be careful when you label people soft. I was part of
that staff in Philadelphia. We could have drafted Daugherty, but
there were concerns that he was too soft.''Chris Mihm is an NBA
player. (Rosner, Austin American-Statesman). 49. WITH FILE PHOTO.

January, 1998. Hoping to move back into the first round, the Spurs
will offer the two second-round picks they hold, Nos. 41 and 54
overall. The 41st pick was acquired in a trade with Dallas last
year. No. 54 is the Spurs' own second-round slot.The Spurs, who do
not have a first-rounder, may try to trade two seconds for a first.

<HEADLINE>
ERNIE IRVAN IN THE SLOW LANE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.C., S.C., Fla., Calif., Mich.)   By HOWARD SENZELL   The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa, Calif.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SONOMA, Calif. _ Last year Ernie Irvan was one of 43 drivers in
the Save Mart/Kragen 350 at Sears Point. On Sunday he will be the
grand marshal for the parade lap, a spectator, a former Winston Cup
driver.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992 and '94 he took the checkered flag here. Irvan, Jeff
Gordon and Rusty Wallace are the only drivers to win Sears Point
twice. This year while Gordon and Wallace are racing, Irvan will be
in the pace car, a guest of Sears Point management.
</P>
<P>
   At 41, Irvan would seem to have good racing years left. But two
crashes, including one in which he was given a 10 percent chance to
survive, persuaded him to retire.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks after his second accident, doctors told Irvan one more
head trauma would be fatal. The next day, Sept. 3, 1999, Irvan
announced his retirement at a tearful press conference in
Darlington, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I miss it?'' Irvan replied to the obvious question. ``You
bet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would I ever consider a comeback? No.''
</P>
<P>
   Irvan is at peace with his retirement and his choice to spend
time with his son, Jared, and daughter, Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a doctor tells you another blow to the head will be
fatal, it puts things in perspective,'' he said. ``I retired
because I knew it was time, not because I was forced out.''
</P>
<P>
   Irvan retired with 15 Winston Cup victories and earnings of more
than $11 million. Casual fans may know him best for the horrific
accident that nearly took his life on Aug. 20, 1994. In a practice
run for the GM Goodwrench Dealer 400 at Michigan Speedway, Irvan's
right front tire deflated, sending the car into the Turn 2 wall at
more than 170 mph.
</P>
<P>
   After emergency workers extricated him from the car, he was
diagnosed with critical brain and lung injuries. Doctors grimly
announced he had a 1-in-10 chance of surviving that first night.
</P>
<P>
   By early September, though, he was well enough to be removed
from ventilator support. A few months after that he walked on stage
at the NASCAR Awards Banquet in New York to receive the True Value
Hard Charger Award.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 16, 1995, NASCAR cleared Irvan for competition and two
weeks later he qualified on the outside pole for a race at North
Wilkesboro, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, in retrospect, that was the highlight of my career,''
Irvan said. ``After everything I went through, and because most
people said I couldn't come back, it felt great to be racing
again.''
</P>
<P>
   He wrote a storybook chapter to his career in 1997 when he
returned to Michigan International Raceway and won the Miller 400
after starting in 20th position. His driving career, however, ended
exactly five years later at the same raceway.
</P>
<P>
   As before, he crashed in a practice session and was airlifted
from the track. This time it was a milder head injury and bruised
lung, but the doctors said next time Irvan would not be so lucky.
</P>
<P>
   So, these days Irvan lives a more typical life. He drives his
daughter to school, picks up the dry cleaning and runs other
errands for his wife, Kim.
</P>
<P>
   Retirement, however, has not been smooth. The injuries have
taken a toll and then in March, fire destroyed Irvan's
10,000-square-foot home on his 160-acre farm in Mooresville, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fire was a very traumatic thing and my family and I still
aren't over it,'' Irvan said. ``Our goal is to rebuild the house
like it was. We're trying to get back what we had.''
</P>
<P>
   Irvan says he's just ``80 percent'' of what he was before the
crashes. He can't focus like he could before the first crash and
his instincts aren't as sharp. He says he becomes flustered in
heavy traffic.
</P>
<P>
   His publicist, Roxanne Pauline, said Irvan's fan club has grown
to more than 3,000 since his retirement and his clothing line
continues to sell well. He has been hired to make appearances at
tracks such as Daytona, Charlotte, Pocono and now Sears Point. He
has taped a fishing show for Fox Sports Net and has been featured
in segments for ESPN 2's Outdoor Life show.
</P>
<P>
   Irvan set aside time this week to thank a special group of
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I owe my life to the doctors at the University of San
Francisco,'' Irvan said. ``This year, now that I'm retired, I'll
have a chance to spend time with them.''
</P>
<P>
   While recovering from his first accident, a brain aneurism was
detected. He was referred to surgeons in San Francisco. The
delicate surgery was a success, enabling Irvan to continue his
recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm at peace with what my life is now,'' Irvan said. ``I have
a lot to be thankful for and I lead a fairly normal life.''

SLUGGISH CARS SALES IN JUNE MAY INDICATE COOLING ECONOMY 
</HEADLINE>
   By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Automakers say that despite their recent deep
discounts, sales have not picked up in June from the relatively
subdued pace of May, providing evidence for the Federal Reserve
that recent interest-rate increases may be slowing the American
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Auto executives and dealers say sales of luxury cars and luxury
sport utility vehicles remain extremely strong. But the mass market
for more affordable cars, minivans, sport utility vehicles and
pickup trucks has clearly slowed as middle-class families have
become leery of borrowing money at steeper interest rates, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our Cadillacs are outselling our Pontiacs, and that has never
happened to us before,'' said Michael Coy, the general manager of a
dealership in Vancouver, Wash. The Cadillac buyers are frequently
paying cash with their stock-market profits, while traditional
Pontiac customers are beginning to buy late-model used cars
instead, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Ursomarso, a dealer in Wilmington, Del., said on Thursday
that his seven dealerships had sold 159 vehicles in June, compared
with 166 for the same time last year, because less-prosperous
buyers were shifting to used cars. ``In my Jaguar, BMW and Volvo
businesses, the pace is still very, very good _ those consumers who
are more educated and more affluent are still buying,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Automakers, especially DaimlerChrysler AG, have been stepping up
their rebates, with Dodge now offering discounts on every model
except the Viper sports car. But the manufacturers have also been
quietly raising the subsidized interest rates they offer on car
loans. They have concluded that it has become too costly to
continue offering loans at 1.9 percent and subsidizing the
difference compared with market rates on auto loans, which are
approaching 10 percent for a three-year loan.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Woods, the retail finance manager at Ford's lending unit,
Ford Credit, said the discounted rates offered by Ford Credit were
likely to rise another full percentage point when the automaker
adjusts rates in early July, even if Fed officials leave short-term
rates unchanged next week as expected.
</P>
<P>
   High gasoline prices appear to have had surprisingly little
effect so far on the types of vehicles being sold, auto company
officials said. Even in the Midwest, where gasoline prices are
highest, the biggest gas-guzzlers, mainly large sport utilities,
are selling well because they are being purchased by households so
affluent that they are not especially worried about the cost of
fuel, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The auto industry sold cars and light trucks at a torrid
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 18 million vehicles in the
six-month period that ended on April 30. That pace cooled to a rate
of 17.1 million vehicles in May, and both Ford and General Motors
are predicting virtually the same rate _ 17 million _ for June.
</P>
<P>
   The auto industry sold 17 million vehicles in all of last year,
its best year ever, so the pace in the last two months does not
represent a significant slowdown. But it still shows a contrast
with the brisk pace last winter, with small and midsize cars, sport
utility vehicles, minivans and pickup trucks beginning to clog some
dealerships' lots.
</P>
<P>
   Most automakers will be announcing their June sales on July 3,
but DaimlerChrysler plans to wait until July 5. It will be hard to
judge the overall strength of sales in June until DaimlerChrysler
reports because the company has become aggressive in offering
rebates after its sales plunged 16.8 percent in May.
DaimlerChrysler had temporarily renounced most discounts in May, in
an unsuccessful attempt to persuade the industry to wean itself of
its dependence on discounts.

 &HT;    Bush unscathed by execution according to analystBy Jena Heath
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The controversy that swirled around convicted
murderer Gary Graham's execution should not damage Gov. George W.
Bush's White House bid even as potent questions about the way Texas
metes out justice persist, political observers said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Graham proclaimed his innocence until his death by lethal
injection at 8:39 p.m. Thursday, two hours after he was scheduled
to die because appeals by his lawyers delayed the execution.
Shortly before the execution, Bush told reporters, ``I am confident
that justice is being done. May God bless the victims, the families
of the victims and may God bless Mr. Graham.''
</P>
<P>
   That somber tone, coupled with polls showing that two-thirds of
Americans continue to support the death penalty, has insulated Bush
from fallout over the execution of a ninth-grade dropout convicted
on the testimony of a single eyewitness, said Larry Sabato, a
political scholar at the University of Virginia. Ironically, he
said the whole controversy could wind up damaging Vice President Al
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush's position has helped him,'' Sabato said. ``He appeared
compassionate and serious throughout the episode. He did not appear
blood thirsty, which would have hurt him. By inference, Gore was
portrayed as anti death-penalty, which he's not. His allies, like
Jesse Jackson, were the people out front calling for an abolition
of the death penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore remained largely silent throughout the debate, saying only
that states with high rates of criminal justice errors, such as
Illinois, should consider suspending executions. Republican
Illinois Gov. George Ryan's decision to take that step earlier this
year helped set off questions about the death penalty. Ryan did so
after 13 men on death row in his state were exonerated.
</P>
<P>
   Sabato said Gore's silence has been a tactical mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the average person not paying close attention to politics,
the assumption is that if Bush is for the death penalty, that Gore
must be against it,'' he said. ``Gore reinforced that by not
commenting. He didn't want to get into it. And what he did say was
equivocal.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Jano Cabrera called Sabato's take, ``entirely
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore was on the front page of the New York Times
unequivocally stating his support for the death penalty....,''
Cabrera said. ``Every time he's been asked about it, he's made his
position clear, that he supports the death penalty for heinous
crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   University of Texas political scientist Bruce Buchanan said
there is no good political reason for Bush to soften his death
penalty stance even with 15 executions lined up before the November
election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing that I can see suggests that the public is going to
revise its view of either the death penalty or of Governor Bush,''
Buchanan said.
</P>
<P>
   But given questions raised about the quality of legal
representation for Texas death row inmates, Bush should consider
softening his language when he asserts that he is certain that all
135 people executed on his watch have been guilty, Sabato
cautioned.
</P>
<P>
   A recent investigation by the Chicago Tribune raised questions
about shoddy legal representation and the use of jailhouse
witnesses in capital cases in Texas. Nationally, a Columbia
University study found that two-thirds of death sentences in the
past 23 years have been overturned and DNA testing has led to the
release of innocent men on death row.
</P>
<P>
   Sabato said it would strengthen the, ``compassionate part of his
compassionate conservatism,'' for Bush to ask Attorney General John
Cornyn to conduct a study over the next few months of how the death
penalty is applied in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should the governor be given pardon power?'' Sabato said.
``That's seems like a perfectly reasonable question to ask.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Texas law, a governor may not override the 18-member Board
of Pardons and Paroles, all gubernatorial appointees, if it votes
to move forward with an execution. A governor can grant a single,
unilateral 30-day reprieve, a choice Bush said he did not have this
time because former Gov. Ann Richards had already given Graham such
a delay.
</P>
<P>
   David R. Dow, a law professor at the University of Houston, said
the argument that Bush was powerless to delay Graham's execution
is, `` a myth that's been created by the governor's office.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think about that provision, the obvious logic is to
prevent a single governor from thwarting a jury verdict by issuing
stay after stay after stay,'' he said. ``It suggests that what it
really means is that a single governor can only grant a single
stay. So, I think he had the power under that law to grant a
single, 30-day reprieve.''
</P>
<P>
   Dow said it would take a court challenge to clarify the statute,
unlikely given the politics surrounding Graham's case. Cornyn's
office also read the law to mean that Bush could not grant a 30-day
reprieve.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're allies and that's the interpretation that best
protected Governor Bush,'' Dow said.
</P>
<P>
   After Graham had exhausted his appeals Thursday, the state could
legally have moved ahead with the execution even though his
lawyers, taking their last shot, filed a civil suit against the
pardons board. Ironically, presidential politics probably gave
Graham more time, Dow said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think at that point, if it were not Gary Graham, if it were
not for all this national media attention, I wouldn't have been
surprised if the state had gone ahead.''

 &HT;    Bush unscathed by execution according to analystBy Jena Heath
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The controversy that swirled around convicted
murderer Gary Graham's execution should not damage Gov. George W.
Bush's White House bid even as potent questions about the way Texas
metes out justice persist, political observers said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Graham proclaimed his innocence until his death by lethal
injection at 8:39 p.m. Thursday, two hours after he was scheduled
to die because appeals by his lawyers delayed the execution.
Shortly before the execution, Bush told reporters, ``I am confident
that justice is being done. May God bless the victims, the families
of the victims and may God bless Mr. Graham.''
</P>
<P>
   That somber tone, coupled with polls showing that two-thirds of
Americans continue to support the death penalty, has insulated Bush
from fallout over the execution of a ninth-grade dropout convicted
on the testimony of a single eyewitness, said Larry Sabato, a
political scholar at the University of Virginia. Ironically, he
said the whole controversy could wind up damaging Vice President Al
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush's position has helped him,'' Sabato said. ``He appeared
compassionate and serious throughout the episode. He did not appear
blood thirsty, which would have hurt him. By inference, Gore was
portrayed as anti death-penalty, which he's not. His allies, like
Jesse Jackson, were the people out front calling for an abolition

ROAD COURSES PROVIDE A DIFFERENT SET OF CHALLENGES 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICH RUPPRECHT   
 The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa, Calif.  
 
 2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SONOMA, Calif. _ Sure, Jeff Gordon is going to have to worry
about Mark Martin and Rusty Wallace on Sunday and Dale Earnhardt
will be wary of the Burton brothers and Ricky Rudd, but the real
battle figures to be each NASCAR driver against the Sears Point
course.
</P>
<P>
   Road races on the Winston Cup Series are polar opposites from
the usual oval track racing. There's plenty more to do than just
turn left. The cars must be set up differently, with weight needed
on both sides. The cars are even different. They aren't the cars
driven last week in Pocono. These are road race cars, NASCAR style.
Each team has one for Sears Point and Watkins Glen, the only two
road race courses on the Winston Cup circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Most NASCAR drivers won't say they hate the road race courses,
just that they offer different challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's kind of in the same boat,'' said Tony Stewart, who
has won two Winston Cup races this year and was running third at
Sears Point last year when a flat tire caused him to drop back in
the pack. ``We all only run two road course races a year.''
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line, though, is that road cars are not the top
priority for NASCAR teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just not something that we focus really hard on because
we do only have two races on the schedule that are road courses,''
Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Gordon has won the last five road races _ two at Sears
Point and three at Watkins Glen _ which makes him the favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Racers who have watched Gordon at Sears Point describe him as
someone who doesn't always attack the course, but studies it early
on in the race. He seems to feel out the course, waits to make
moves and takes advantage of others' mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly much different than racing on the ovals,''
Gordon said. ``When you're on an oval track, you're in the corner
much longer, you've got to be thinking a lot more about what the
car is doing. You have to be thinking about the shocks and springs
and, `What can I do as a driver and how can I tell the team what
the car is doing?'
</P>
<P>
   ``On a road course, a lot of it is, you win a certain corner,
drive the car in pretty deep, and think, `I probably could have
gone in deeper, maybe I could have picked up on the throttle a
little later.'''
</P>
<P>
   Before Gordon came along, it was Rudd, Rusty Wallace and Terry
Labonte who built reputations as the top road course drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart is only a second-year NASCAR driver, but he showed
proficiency at Sears Point last year. Following Monday's race at
Pocono, Stewart headed to a road course in Virginia to prepare for
Sears Point.
</P>
<P>
   The keys to any road race course are knowing how to get into and
out of turns, when to shift gears _ most cars have four speeds, and
turns can be taken in either first or second gear _ and how to be
light on the brakes so the wheels don't lock up.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all the drivers have had road race schooling. Dale
Earnhardt Jr., a rookie on the circuit this season, visited Sears
Point in April along with a handful of NASCAR drivers and joined
drivers from the track's Russell Driving School.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, road course racing is more of a mental thing,'' said
Kyle Petty, who has a win at the other road course in Watkins Glen.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to show these road courses some affection,'' Petty
said. ``You can't walk in there telling the place how much you hate
it and how much you wish you had a bulldozer to dig it up and how
that fifth-mile at Yancey Hollar Speedway in Wherever, Mississippi,
is a heck of a lot better deal than this. You have to get your mind
right and you have to have some fun with it.''
</P>
<P>
   John Andretti, who will race the STP No. 43 car for Richard
Petty, said road racing experience can be slightly overrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually we go to Sears Point or Watkins Glen and people start
looking for an Indy car background to decide who is a good road
course racer and who isn't,'' he said. ``If I was a car owner
running just one race, I'd go find me a good stock car driver
first, especially one who is pretty good on the short tracks, and
worry about his road course racing second.''
</P>
<P>
   Andretti concedes that experience on road courses is an
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you can take a good stock car driver and teach him to be a
pretty good road course racer,'' he said. ``You can't always take a
good road course racer and make him a good stock car driver.''

ERNIE IRVAN IN THE SLOW LANE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating)  
 (ATTN: N.C., S.C., Fla., Calif., Mich.)   By HOWARD SENZELL   
 The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa, Calif.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SONOMA, Calif. _ Last year Ernie Irvan was one of 43 drivers in
the Save Mart/Kragen 350 at Sears Point. On Sunday he will be the
grand marshal for the parade lap, a spectator, a former Winston Cup
driver.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992 and '94 he took the checkered flag here. Irvan, Jeff
Gordon and Rusty Wallace are the only drivers to win Sears Point
twice. This year while Gordon and Wallace are racing, Irvan will be
in the pace car, a guest of Sears Point management.
</P>
<P>
   At 41, Irvan would seem to have good racing years left. But two
crashes, including one in which he was given a 10 percent chance to
survive, persuaded him to retire.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks after his second accident, doctors told Irvan one more
head trauma would be fatal. The next day, Sept. 3, 1999, Irvan
announced his retirement at a tearful press conference in
Darlington, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I miss it?'' Irvan replied to the obvious question. ``You
bet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would I ever consider a comeback? No.''
</P>
<P>
   Irvan is at peace with his retirement and his choice to spend
time with his son, Jared, and daughter, Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a doctor tells you another blow to the head will be
fatal, it puts things in perspective,'' he said. ``I retired
because I knew it was time, not because I was forced out.''
</P>
<P>
   Irvan retired with 15 Winston Cup victories and earnings of more
than $11 million. Casual fans may know him best for the horrific
accident that nearly took his life on Aug. 20, 1994. In a practice
run for the GM Goodwrench Dealer 400 at Michigan Speedway, Irvan's
right front tire deflated, sending the car into the Turn 2 wall at
more than 170 mph.
</P>
<P>
   After emergency workers extricated him from the car, he was
diagnosed with critical brain and lung injuries. Doctors grimly
announced he had a 1-in-10 chance of surviving that first night.
</P>
<P>
   By early September, though, he was well enough to be removed
from ventilator support. A few months after that he walked on stage
at the NASCAR Awards Banquet in New York to receive the True Value
Hard Charger Award.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 16, 1995, NASCAR cleared Irvan for competition and two
weeks later he qualified on the outside pole for a race at North
Wilkesboro, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, in retrospect, that was the highlight of my career,''
Irvan said. ``After everything I went through, and because most
people said I couldn't come back, it felt great to be racing
again.''
</P>
<P>
   He wrote a storybook chapter to his career in 1997 when he
returned to Michigan International Raceway and won the Miller 400
after starting in 20th position. His driving career, however, ended
exactly five years later at the same raceway.
</P>
<P>
   As before, he crashed in a practice session and was airlifted
from the track. This time it was a milder head injury and bruised
lung, but the doctors said next time Irvan would not be so lucky.
</P>
<P>
   So, these days Irvan lives a more typical life. He drives his
daughter to school, picks up the dry cleaning and runs other
errands for his wife, Kim.
</P>
<P>
   Retirement, however, has not been smooth. The injuries have
taken a toll and then in March, fire destroyed Irvan's
10,000-square-foot home on his 160-acre farm in Mooresville, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fire was a very traumatic thing and my family and I still
aren't over it,'' Irvan said. ``Our goal is to rebuild the house
like it was. We're trying to get back what we had.''
</P>
<P>
   Irvan says he's just ``80 percent'' of what he was before the
crashes. He can't focus like he could before the first crash and
his instincts aren't as sharp. He says he becomes flustered in
heavy traffic.
</P>
<P>
   His publicist, Roxanne Pauline, said Irvan's fan club has grown
to more than 3,000 since his retirement and his clothing line
continues to sell well. He has been hired to make appearances at
tracks such as Daytona, Charlotte, Pocono and now Sears Point. He
has taped a fishing show for Fox Sports Net and has been featured
in segments for ESPN 2's Outdoor Life show.
</P>
<P>
   Irvan set aside time this week to thank a special group of
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I owe my life to the doctors at the University of San
Francisco,'' Irvan said. ``This year, now that I'm retired, I'll
have a chance to spend time with them.''
</P>
<P>
   While recovering from his first accident, a brain aneurism was
detected. He was referred to surgeons in San Francisco. The
delicate surgery was a success, enabling Irvan to continue his
recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm at peace with what my life is now,'' Irvan said. ``I have
a lot to be thankful for and I lead a fairly normal life.''

 (For release Sunday, June 25)  
(EDS: Since Sunday, June 4, and continuing for six weeks, The New
York Times has been publishing a series of articles, ``How Race Is
Lived in America.'' The series is the outcome of a yearlong effort
by a team of Times reporters to capture some of the voices of
ordinary people and some of the troubling issues that Americans
continue to face. These stories, two or three each week, will be
approximately 6,000 words. The News Service will move each story in
advance, and an abridged version will also move, at approximately
3,000 words. They will move in the ``a'' news category and will
carry a slug of the form BC-RACE-SLUG-NYT. Because the articles are
organized into chapters, papers with severe space restraints may
choose to spread a single article over several days. Please see

   MAPLEWOOD, N.J. _ Back in eighth grade, Kelly Regan, Aqeelah
Mateen and Johanna Perez-Fox spent New Year's Eve at Johanna's
house, swing-dancing until they fell down laughing, banging pots
and pans, watching the midnight fireworks beyond the trees in the
park at the center of town.
</P>
<P>
   They had been a tight threesome all through Maplewood Middle
School _ Kelly, a tall, coltish Irish Catholic girl; Aqeelah, a
small, earnest African-American Muslim girl, and Johanna, a
light-coffee-colored girl who is half Jewish and half Puerto Rican
and famous for knowing just about everyone.
</P>
<P>
   It had been a great night, they agreed, a whole lot simpler than
Johanna's birthday party three nights before. Johanna had invited
all their friends, white and black. But the mixing had not gone as
she had wished.
</P>
<P>
   ``The black kids stayed down in the basement and danced, and the
white kids went outside on the stoop and talked,'' Johanna said.
``I went out and said, `Why don't you guys come downstairs?' and
they said they didn't want to, that they just wanted to talk out
there. It was just split up, like two parties.''
</P>
<P>
   The same thing happened at Kelly's back-to-school party a few
months earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so stressful,'' Kelly said. ``There I was, the hostess,
and I couldn't get everybody together.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, man, I was, like, trying to help her,'' Aqeelah said. ``I
went up and down and up and down. But it was boring outside, so
finally I just gave up and went down and danced.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, the girls started high school, and what with the
difficulty of mixing their black and white friends, none took on
the challenge of a birthday party.
</P>
<P>
   It happens everywhere, in the confusions of adolescence and the
yearning for identity, when the most important thing in life is
choosing a group and fitting in: Black children and white children
come apart. They move into separate worlds. Friendships ebb and
end.
</P>
<P>
   It happens everywhere, but what is striking is that it happens
even here. In a nation of segregated schools, the South
Orange-Maplewood district is extraordinarily mixed. Not only is the
student body about half black and half white, but in the last
census, blacks had an economic edge. This is the kind of place
where people _ black and white _ talk a lot about the virtues of
diversity and worry about white flight, where hundreds will turn
out to discuss the book ``Why Are All the Black Kids Sitting
Together in the Cafeteria?'' People here care about race.
</P>
<P>
   But even here, as if pulled by internal magnets, black and white
children begin to separate at sixth grade. These are children who
walked to school together, learned to read together, slept over at
each other's houses. But despite all the personal history, all the
community good will, race divides them as they grow up. As racial
consciousness develops _ and the practice of grouping students by
perceived ability sends them on diverging academic paths _ race
becomes as much a fault line in their world as in the one their
parents hoped to move beyond.
</P>
<P>
   As they began high school, Kelly, Johanna and Aqeelah had so far
managed to be exceptions. While the world around them had
increasingly divided along racial lines, they had stuck together.
But where their friendship would go was hard to say. And like a
Greek chorus, the voices of other young people warned of tricky
currents ahead.
</P>
<P>
   DIFFERENT BUT INSEPARABLE
</P>
<P>
   On her first day at Columbia High School, Kelly Regan takes a
seat in homeroom and introduced herself to the black boy at the
next desk. .
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to be friendly,'' she explained. ``But he
answered in like one word, and looked away. I think he just thought
I was a normal white person, and that's all he saw.''
</P>
<P>
   She certainly looks like a normal white person, with her pale
skin and straight brown hair. But in middle school, she trooped
with Aqeelah and Johanna to Martin Luther King Association
meetings; there were only a handful of white girls, but Kelly said
she never felt out of place. ``Some people say I'm ghetto,'' she
said, shrugging. ``I don't care.''
</P>
<P>
   She had always had a mixed group of friends, and since the
middle of eighth grade had been dating a mixed-race classmate,
Jared Watts. Even so, she expected that it would be harder to make
black friends in the ninth grade. ``It's not because of the person
I am,'' she said, ``it's just how it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly's mother, Kathy, is fascinated by her daughter's
multiracial world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so different from how I grew up,'' said Kathy Regan, a
nurse who met Kelly's father, from whom she is divorced, at a
virtually all-white Catholic school. ``Sometimes, in front of the
high school, I feel a little intimidated when I see all the black
kids. But then so many of them know me, from my oldest daughter or
now from Kelly, and they say such a nice, `Hi, Mrs. Regan,' that
the feeling goes away.''
</P>
<P>
   Johanna Perez-Fox is intensely sociable; her mane of long black
curls can often be sighted at the center of a rushed gossip session
in the last seconds before class. As she sees it, her mixed
background gives her a choice of racial identity and access to
everybody. ``I like that I can go both ways,'' said Johanna, whose
mother is a special-education teacher and whose father owns a car
service.
</P>
<P>
   Johanna has a certain otherness among her black friends. ``If
they say something about white people, they'll always say, `Oh,
sorry, Johanna,''' she said. ``I think it's good. It makes them
more aware of their stereotypes.''

 MAPLEWOOD, N.J.: their stereotypes.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Still, she was put off when a new black friend asked what race
she was.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are always asking, `What are you?' and I don't really
like it,'' she said. ``I told him I'm half white and half Puerto
Rican, and he said, `But you act black.' I told him you can't act
like a race. I hate that idea. He defended it, though. He said I
would have a point if he'd said African-American, because that's a
race, but black is a way of acting. I've thought about it, and I
think he's right.''
</P>
<P>
   Aqeelah Mateen's parents are divorced, and she lives in a mostly
black section of Maplewood, with her mother, who works for AT&AMP;T.
She also sees a lot of her father, a skycap at Newark Airport, and
often goes with him to the Newark mosque where he is an imam.
</P>
<P>
   Aqeelah is a girl of multiple enthusiasms, and in middle school,
her gutsy good cheer kept her close to black and white friends
alike. But in high school, the issue of acting black was starting
to become a persistent irritant.
</P>
<P>
   After school one day, Aqeelah and two other black girls were
running down the hall when one of them accidentally knocked a
corkboard off the wall. Aqeelah told her to pick it up, but the
girl kept going.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the matter with you?'' Aqeelah asked. ``You knocked it
over, you pick it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Why do you have to be like a white person? her friend retorted.
Just leave it there.
</P>
<P>
   But Aqeelah picks it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's stuff like that all the time, and it gets on my
nerves,'' she said later. ``Like at track, in the locker room,
there's people telling a Caucasian girl she has a big butt for a
white person, and I'm like, who cares, shut up.''
</P>
<P>
   ON AN EVEN PLAYGROUND
</P>
<P>
   Johanna and Aqeelah met in kindergarten and have been friends
from Day 1; Kelly joined the group in fifth grade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody cared about race when we were little,'' Johanna said.
``No one thought about it.''
</P>
<P>
   On a winter afternoon at South Mountain Elementary School, that
still seemed to be the case. There were white and black pockets,
but mostly the playground was a picture postcard of racial harmony,
white girls and black girls playing clapping games, black boys and
white boys shooting space aliens.
</P>
<P>
   And when they were asked about race and friendships, there was
no self-consciousness. They just said what they had to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Making friends, it just depends on what you like to do, and
who likes to do those things,'' said Carolyn Goldstein, a white
third grader.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've known Carolyn G. since kindergarten,'' said a black girl
named Carolyn Morton. ``She lives on my block. She's in my class.
We even have the same name. We have so many things the same!''
</P>
<P>
   As for how they might be different, Carolyn Goldstein groped for
an answer: ``Well, she has a mom at home and my mom works, and she
has a sister, and I don't.''
</P>
<P>
   They know race matters in the world, they said, but not here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people in some places still feel prejudiced, so I guess
it's still a kind of an issue, because Martin Luther King was
trying to save the world from slaves and bad people and there still
are bad people in jail,'' Carolyn Morton said, finishing up
grandly. ``I hope by the year 3000, the world will have peace, and
the guys who watch the prisoners can finally go home and spend some
time with their families.''
</P>
<P>
   A SHIFTING SANDBOX
</P>
<P>
   All through middle school, Johanna, Kelly and Aqeelah ate lunch
together in a back corner of the cafeteria, where they could see
everyone. The main axis of their friendship was changeable: In
seventh grade, Johanna and Kelly were the closest. In eighth grade,
as Kelly spent more time with Jared, Johanna and Aqeelah were the
tightest.
</P>
<P>
   But at the end of middle school, the three were nominated as
class ``best friends.'' And while they saw their classmates
dividing along racial lines, they tried to ignore it. ``In middle
school, I didn't want to be aware of the separation,'' Kelly said.
``I didn't see why it had to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Most young people here seem to accept the racial split as
inevitable. It's just how it is, they said. Or, it just happens.
Or, it's just easier to be with your own kind.
</P>
<P>
   When Sierre Monk, who is black, graduated from South Mountain,
she had friends of all races. But since then, she has moved away
from the whites and closer to the blacks. Now, in eighth grade, she
referred to the shift, sometimes, as ``my drift,'' as in, ``After
my drift, I began to notice more how the black kids talk
differently from the white kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Sierre said her drift began after a sixth-grade argument.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said, `You don't even act like you're black,''' she
remembered. ``I hadn't thought much about it until then, because I
was too young. And I guess it was mean what they said, but it
helped me. I found I wanted to behave differently after that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sierre (pronounced see-AIR-ah) had come from a mostly white
private school in Brooklyn. She is the granddaughter of Thelonius
Monk, the great jazz pianist, and more than most families, her
parents _ Thelonius, a drummer, and Gale, who manages her husband's
career and father-in-law's estate _ have an integrated social life.
</P>
<P>
   For Gale Monk, it has come as something of a surprise to hear
Sierre talk about her new distance from her white friends.
</P>
<P>
   What about the bat mitzvah this weekend? Gale Monk asked.
</P>
<P>
   Well, that's just because we used to be friends, Sierre said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you mean? She's in and out of this house all the time.
I can't remember how many times she's slept over or been in my
kitchen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That was last year, Mom. This year's different. Things have
changed.''
</P>
<P>
   And Sierre's mother allows that some separation may be healthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any problem with the black kids hanging
together,'' she said. ``I think you need to know your own group to
feel proud of yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a consensus that the split is mostly, though hardly
exclusively, a matter of blacks' pulling away.
</P>
<P>
   Marian Flaxman, a white girl in Sierre's homeroom, puts it this
way: ``You know, you come to a new school and you're all little and
scared, and everybody's looking for a way to fit in, for people to
like them. At that point, I think we were just white kids, blah,
and they were just black kids, blah, and we were all just kids. And
then a few black kids began thinking, `Hey, we're  &UR; black &LR;  kids.' I
think the black kids feel like they're black and the white kids
feel like they're white because the black kids feel like they're
black.''

 MAPLEWOOD, N.J.: they're black.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And Sierre does not really disagree: ``Everybody gets along, but
I think the white kids are more friendly toward black or
interracial kids, and the black kids aren't as interested back,
just because of stupid stereotypical stuff like music and style.''
</P>
<P>
   What they cannot quite articulate, though, is how much the
divide owes to their growing awareness of the larger society, to
negative messages about race and about things like violence and
academic success. They may not connect the dots, but that
sensitivity makes them intensely alert to slights from friends of
another race, likely to pull away at even a hint of rejection.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it is simply a misread cue, as when a black girl,
sitting with other black girls, holds up a hand to greet a white
friend, and the white girl thinks her greeting means, ``I see you,
but don't join us.'' Sometimes, it is an obvious, if oblivious,
offense: A black boy drops a white friend after discovering that
the friend has told another white boy that the black family's food
is weird.
</P>
<P>
   And occasionally, the breach is startlingly painful: A white
seventh grader considers changing schools after her best friend
tells her she can no longer afford white friends. Months later, the
white girl talked uncomfortably about how unreachable her former
friend seemed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to go sit with her at the homey table,'' she
said, then flushed in intense embarrassment: ``I'm not sure I'm
supposed to say homey. I'm not sure that's what they call
themselves; maybe it sounds racist.''
</P>
<P>
   And indeed, the black girl believed that some of the things her
former friend had said did fall between insensitive and racist.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, both mothers, in identical tones, expressed
anger and hurt about how badly their daughters had been treated.
Each, again in identical tones, said her daughter had been
blameless. But the mothers had never been friends, and like their
daughters, never talked about what happened, never heard the other
side.
</P>
<P>
   Marian Flaxman went to a mostly black preschool, and several
black friends from those days remain classmates. But, she said, it
has been years since she visited a black friend's home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I feel like I'm the only one who remembers that we
used to be friends,'' she said. ``Now we don't say hello in the
halls, and the most we'd say in class is something like, `Can I
borrow your eraser?'''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if she knew of any close and lasting cross-race
friendships, she was stumped, paging through her yearbook and
offering up a few tight friendships between white and mixed-race
classmates.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Hughes, a New York University psychology professor who
lives in South Orange, has studied the changing friendships of
children here. In the first year of middle school, she found, black
children were only half as likely as they had been two years before
to name a white child as a best friend. Whites had fewer black
friends to start with, but their friendships changed less. But
blacks and whites, on reaching middle school, were only half as
likely as third graders to say they had invited a friend of a
different race home recently.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of middle school, the separation is profound.
</P>
<P>
   At 10 p.m. on a Friday in October, 153 revved-up 13-year-olds
squealed and hugged their way into the South Orange Middle School
cafeteria for the Eighth Grade Sleepover. At 11, they were grouped
by birthday months, each group to write what they loved about
school.
</P>
<P>
   They loved Skittles at lunch . . . the Eighth Grade Sleepover .
. . Ms. Wright, the health teacher/basketball coach/Martin Luther
King Club adviser. And at the March table, a white boy wrote
``interracial friendships.''
</P>
<P>
   But the moment the organized activities ended, the black and
white eighth graders separated. And at 2 a.m., when the girls'
sleeping bags covered the library floor and the boys' the gym, they
formed a map of racial boundaries. The borders were peaceful, but
there was little commerce across territorial lines. After lights
out, some black girls stood and started a clapping chant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't,'' one girl called.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not?'' the group called back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not?''
</P>
<P>
   ``My back's hurting and my bra's too tight.''
</P>
<P>
   It grew louder as other black girls threaded their way through
the darkness to join in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I shake my booty from left to right.''
</P>
<P>
   Marian, in her green parrot slippers, was in a group of white
girls up front, enjoying, listening, but quiet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's cool, when they start stuff like that, or in the
lunchroom when they start rumbling on the table and we all pick it
up,'' she said. ``It's just louder. One time in class this year,
someone was acting up, and when the teacher said sit down, the boy
said, ``It's because I'm black, isn't it?'' I thought, no, it's not
because you're black, that's stupid, it's because you're being
really noisy and obnoxious. And it made me feel really white. And
then I began thinking, well, maybe it is because he's black,
because being noisy may be part of that culture, and then I didn't
know what to think.''
</P>
<P>
   JOSTLING FOR POSITION
</P>
<P>
   Aqeelah, Kelly and Johanna refuse to characterize behavior as
black or white; they just hate it, they insist, when anyone
categorizes them in racial terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what makes Kelly and Johanna and me different is that
we're what people don't expect,'' Aqeelah said. ``I'm the only
Muslim most people know, and one of two African-Americans on my
softball team. There's Kelly, a white girl playing basketball, and
Johanna, when people ask if she's white or Puerto Rican, saying,
`Both.'''
</P>
<P>
   Most students are acutely aware of the signposts of Columbia
High's coexisting cultures. The popular wisdom has it that the
black kids dominate football and basketball, the white kids soccer,
softball and lacrosse. Black kids throw big dancing parties in
rented spaces; white parties are more often in people's homes, with
a lot of drinking. Everyone wears jeans, but the white kids are
more preppy, the black kids more hip-hop. Black kids listen to
radio stations that play hip-hop or rhythm and blues; white kids
favor rock stations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know a lot of Caucasians listen to Hot 97, too,'' Aqeelah
said, referring to a hip-hop station, ``but even if I had a list of
200 Caucasians who listen to it, everyone still thinks it's an
African-American thing.''

VOTERS IN JAPAN SEEM SATISFIED WITH THE STATUS QUO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHARON MOSHAVI GLOBE CORRESPONENT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHIBUKAWA, Japan _ Japan's economy is in a stupor, the prime
minister in the political dog house, and the young generation in a
hurry for change.
</P>
<P>
   In that kind of a climate, voters in most democratic countries
would ``throw the bums out'' to send a clear message to the ruling
party. But not, it seems, in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all polls leading up to Sunday's parliamentary
elections predict that the Liberal Democratic Party, which has
ruled Japan for 43 of the past 45 years, will hold on to power,
possibly even bolstering its majority in the Diet.
</P>
<P>
   It's baffling to many, but there does appear to be an answer:
political inertia.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling party ``has been occupying its position for so long,
they should just continue,'' says barber Hiroaki Suda, 50, echoing
the sentiment of many in this town, known as the ``bellybutton of
Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   Business may be lousy, his shop musty from disuse, but Suda is
in no hurry to elect new faces. ``No politicians can improve the
economy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Home to three prime ministers, including the late Keizo Obuchi,
Shibukawa and its environs are the country's political heartland.
Rural areas like this have for years provided the the ruling
party's core support, in return for the party's largesse and
subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   Though Japan's poor economy has diluted the loyalty of voters
here and many are critical of the massive public spending that is
propping up the economy, most don't want change.
</P>
<P>
   In part, that's because economic conditions are much less
precarious than a few years ago. ``People don't want to lose their
jobs. They want stability, and stability means continuity,'' said
political analyst Shigenori Okazaki in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The lackluster opposition is also keeping many voters from
upsetting the status quo, according to analysts.
</P>
<P>
   The half-dozen or so opposition parties, particularly Minshuto,
the Democratic Party of Japan, have a muddled message and provide
voters with an unappealing alternative, they say.
</P>
<P>
   Some parts of Minshuto's message are difficult for voters to
swallow. The party platform calls for a tax increase in an attempt
to reign in Japan's mounting debt, the highest of any
industrialized nation.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent campaign rally in Tokyo's Ginza district, Yukio
Hatoyama, the party leader, rattled off a list of campaign
proposals, pleading with voters to cast their ballots for any
opposition party at all. ``Don't give your vote to the party that
destroys democracy and freedom,'' Hatoyama urged.
</P>
<P>
   Toshiki Igihashi, a voter, was not impressed. He does not
support the ruling party, but he doesn't trust anyone else either.
``There's no other real party that has enough power to rule,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's newly installed prime minister, Yoshihiro Mori, has been
called a national embarrassment. He's made several verbal blunders
since he replaced Obuchi, who suffered a stroke in April and died a
month later. Most notably, he created a furor when he conjured up
images of the imperialistic past by calling Japan a ``divine nation
with the emperor as its core.''
</P>
<P>
   Just this week, he made another public gaffe when he said he
hoped undecided voters will stay away from the polls. ``It would be
great if they stay uninterested and stay asleep,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mori's approval ratings are hovering around 18 percent, a record
low. Yet the revolving door that is the prime minister's office _
seven have held the post while Bill Clinton was president _
suggests that what matters to people is the system, more than any
single politician.
</P>
<P>
   Family ties matter, too. A full one-third of the candidates for
parliament are relatives of former politicians. Many virtually
inherit their political organizations and their seats, usually from
their fathers.
</P>
<P>
   Case in point is Yuko Obuchi, a 26-year-old former TV producer
who is contesting the seat held by her late father, who, in turn,
at age of 26, inherited the seat from his father.
</P>
<P>
   At Yuko Obuchi's campaign office in Shibukawa, the first thing
that greets visitors is a picture of her father. The campaign is
being run mostly by older men _ politicians who were close to the
late prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   They say it makes sense to have the daughter take her father's
place, that it reassures the voters.
</P>
<P>
   Her qualifications? ``She's young and fresh and pure,'' said
Eiichi Nakamura, a local assembly member and one of Obuchi's
campaign managers. She'll grow into the job, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi has been spending the last few weeks campaigning through
the district. No one expects her to lose, but ``it would be really
rude to only depend on her name and not do anything,'' said another
campaign manager, Yoshihiro Okada.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's political dynasties don't rely on a cult of personality,
like the Gandhis in India or the Kennedys in the U.S. In Japanese
politics, family members are simply, by virtue of their name, in
the best position to take advantage of their relative's political
network, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   The LDP's strong showing in the polls astounds many veteran
political observers. ``It is an extraordinary situation that a
government that has done very poorly for a decade is able to
perhaps get a fresh mandate,'' said Roger Buckley, a professor of
history at the International Christian University in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, most Japanese, in the cities and the countryside, seem
to be so apathetic that few care who wins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever wins, nothing will change,'' said Takiko Hagiwara, 81,
as she bought sweets from a Shibukawa shop.
</P>
<P>
   Shopkeeper Teruko Tosaka agreed. ``The whole system is corrupt,
she lamented, the whole campaign meaningless. What's important,''
she said, pointing at a basket of sweet bean cakes, ``is that
people used to buy 10 at a time. Because of the economy, most only
buy five.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, she can't figure out why so many of her friends and
neighbors are willing to re-elect the government over and over.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a mystery,'' she said.

 MAPLEWOOD, N.J.: African-American thing.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even though the two cultures are in constant, casual contact _
and a few students cross easily back and forth _ in the end, they
are quite separate.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Coleman, a black graduate who just finished his freshman
year at Howard University, remembers how the cultures diverged,
separating him from the white boy with whom he once walked to
school.
</P>
<P>
   ``The summer before high school, we just went different ways,''
he said. ``We listened to different music, we played different
sports, we got interested in different girls. And we didn't have
much to say to each other anymore. That's the time you begin to
develop your own style, and mine was a different style than his.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason's style included heavy gold chains, a diamond ear stud,
baggy pants and hair in short twists. Asked to define that style,
he hesitated, then said, ``I guess what bothers me least is if you
say that I follow hip-hop fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   At the start of high school, much of Jason's energy went toward
straddling the divide between hip-hop kid and honors student. He
was in frequent physical fights, though never with white students;
that doesn't seem to happen. Although blacks are now a slight
majority at the school, he, like many of the black students, felt
an underlying jostling about who really owns the school. And he
felt dismissed, intellectually and socially, by some teachers and
classmates.
</P>
<P>
   ``African-Americans may be the majority, but I don't think they
feel like the majority because they don't feel they get treated
fairly,'' he said. ``You see who gets suspended, and it's the
African-American kids. I had one friend suspended for eating a
bagel in homeroom because his teacher said he had an attitude. That
just wouldn't happen to a Caucasian boy. It doesn't have to be a
big thing to make you feel like it's not really your school. We can
all hold hands and talk about how united we are, but if the next
day you run into a girl from your classes at the mall with her
mother and she doesn't say hello, what's that?''
</P>
<P>
   To avoid these issues, Jason chose a predominantly black
college, Howard, and he seemed relaxed. there this year. The gold
chains and diamond were gone, and he was studying hard to go to
medical school, as his father and brother had.
</P>
<P>
   White students at Columbia High have their own issues. Many feel
intimidated by the awareness that they are becoming a minority at
the school, that they tend not to share academic classes, or
culturally much else, with a lot of the black students. It is
striking that while there are usually a few black or multiracial
children in the school's white groups, whites rarely enter the
black groups. Many white students are reluctant to be quoted about
the racial climate, lest they seem racist. But some recent
graduates are more forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the black kids, it was like they had a really big
chip on their shoulder, and they were mad at the world and mad at
whites for running the world,'' said Jenn Caviness, a white
graduate who attends Columbia University. ``One time, in 10th
grade, in the hall, this black kid shoved me and said, `Get out of
the way, white crack bitch.' I moved, because he was big, but I was
thinking how if I said something racial back, I would have been
attacked. It was very polarized sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   She and others, however, said the cultural jockeying has an
upside _ a freedom from the rigid social hierarchy that plagues
many affluent suburban high schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're different here, it doesn't matter, because there's
so many kinds of differences already,'' Johanna explained when
asked to identify the cool kids, the in crowd. ``There's no one
best way to be.''
</P>
<P>
   In Johanna's commercial art class one day, there was a table of
black boys, a table of white girls and a mixed table, where two
black girls were humming as they work. A white girl asked what the
song was.
</P>
<P>
   They told her, and she said, ``It's really wack.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, one answered, ``You don't know music like we know music.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, and you don't know music like I know music.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know,'' the black girl said, smiling. ``It's like two
completely different tastes.''
</P>
<P>
   ACTING BLACK, ACTING WHITE
</P>
<P>
   Aqeelah, Kelly and Johanna did not have many classes together
this year, but they had grown up in a shared academic world. While
they are not superstars, they do their work and are mostly in
honors classes. But if that common ground has so far helped keep
them together, the system of academic tracking more often helps
pull black and white children apart.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever people talk about race and school, the elephant in the
room _ rarely mentioned, impossible to ignore _ is the racial
imbalance that appears when so-called ability grouping begins.
Almost all American school districts begin tracking sometime before
high school. And when they do, white students are far more likely
than blacks to be placed in higher-level classes, based on test
scores and teacher recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, by any measure of academic performance _ be it
grades, tests or graduation rates _ whites, on average, do better
than blacks. To some extent, it is a matter of differences in
parents' income and education. But the gap remains even when such
things are factored out, even in places like South
Orange-Maplewood.
</P>
<P>
   Experts have no simple explanation, citing a tangle of parents'
attitudes, low expectations of mostly white teaching staffs and
some white classmates, and negative pressure from black students
who believe that doing well isn't cool, that smart is white and
street is black.
</P>
<P>
   It can be a vicious circle _ and a powerful influence on
friendships.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, as students notice that honors classes are mostly
white and lower-level ones mostly black, they develop a corrosive
sense that behaving like the honors students is ``acting white,''
while ``acting black'' demands they emulate the lower-level
students. Little wonder that sixth grade, when ability grouping
starts in South Orange-Maplewood, is also when many interracial
friendships begin to come apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sometimes bothers me to see how many of my African-American
friends aren't in the higher-level classes, and how they try to be
cool around their friends by acting up and trying to be silly and
getting in fights,'' said Sierre, who this year moved up to honors
in everything but math. ``A lot of them just aren't trying. They're
my friends, but I look at them and think, ``Why can't you just be
cool and do your work.'''

 MAPLEWOOD, N.J.: your work.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The district does not release racial breakdowns of its classes.
But at Columbia High, which is 45 percent white, ninth-grade honors
classes usually seem to be about two-thirds white, middle-level
classes more than two-thirds black, and the lowest level _ ``basic
skills'' _ almost entirely black. The imbalance is at least as
great at Marian and Sierre's middle school.
</P>
<P>
   Honors is where students mix most.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really see the difference when you're not in honors,''
said Kelly, who was in middle-level English this year. ``In middle
level, there aren't so many white kids, and whenever you break into
groups, people stick with their own race.''
</P>
<P>
   The contrasts are stark. In Aqeelah's mostly white honors
history class, the students argued passionately about the nature of
man as they compare Hobbes, Locke, Voltaire and Rousseau. But the
next period, when the all-black basic-skills class arrived, the
students headed to the library to learn how to look up facts for a
report on a foreign country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still taken aback, shocked, each time I walk into a class
and see the complexion,'' said LuElla Peniston, a black guidance
counselor at the school. ``It should be more balanced.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue has become especially delicate as the district has
become progressively blacker, as more students moved in from poorer
neighboring towns with troubled schools, and as the ranking on
state tests has slipped. Five years ago, a quarter of the
district's children were black; now, with blacks a slight majority,
many people worry that the district could tip too far. (Of course,
black and white parents tend to have different ideas about how far
is too far.)
</P>
<P>
   The schools are still impressive. Columbia High always sends
dozens of graduates, black and white, to top colleges. It produced
Carla Peterman, a black Rhodes scholar, and Lauryn Hill, the
hip-hop star, who still lives in town. This year Columbia had more
National Achievement Scholarship semifinalists _ an honor for
top-scoring black seniors in the National Merit Scholarship Program
_ than any school in the state. And last year it had an 88 percent
passing rate on the state high school proficiency test, three
points above average.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in a society that often associates racial minorities with
stereotypes of poverty, the district has an image problem. Many
parents _ whites, but also some blacks _ talk nervously about
``those kids with the boomboxes out in front of school,'' and
wonder if they should start checking out private schools or another
district.
</P>
<P>
   The district's administrators have been grappling with questions
of racial balance and ability grouping for years. In middle school,
for example, students can temporarily move up a level, to try more
challenging work. But the program is used mostly by white families
_ to push a child or remove him or her from a mostly black
classroom _ so it has only increased the skew.
</P>
<P>
   Many white parents, Peniston said, are adamant about not letting
their children be anywhere below honors. ``They either push very
hard to get their children into the level where they want them, or
they leave,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   It is not an issue only for whites. Many black parents worry
that the schools somehow associate darker-skinned children with
lower-level classes.
</P>
<P>
   When Kelly's boyfriend, Jared Watts, transferred from South
Orange Middle School to Maplewood Middle, he was placed in
lower-level classes, something his parents discovered only on
parents' night.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were all these African-American families, asking all
these basic questions,'' said Jared's mother, Debby Watts. ``I
looked around and realized they'd put him in the wrong group. I was
so upset I made my husband do the calling the next day. They moved
him up right away. But you can't help but wonder if it would have
happened if he'd been white.''
</P>
<P>
   Sierre Monk's parents are watching her grades, and thinking that
unless she is put in honors classes in high school next year, they
will move her to private school.
</P>
<P>
   Sierre said she is comfortable with her white honors classmates,
even if her best friends now are black. ``I feel friendly to a lot
of the white kids, and still e-mail some of them,'' she said. As
she sees it, she can be a good student without compromising her
African-American credentials. Not everyone, she observes, has been
so culturally dextrous.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people think of the black kids in the top classes,
the ones who don't hang out with a lot of African-Americans, as the
`white' black kids,'' she said. ``I'd never say it to them, but in
my head I call them the white black kids, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, she said, she was happiest in her middle-level math
class, where every student but one is black.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my favorite, because I can do well there without
struggling,'' she said. ``And I feel closest to that class, because
I have so many friends there. Once I was waiting outside, alone,
when I heard a group of white kids talking about, `Oh, those kids
in Level 3, they must be stupid.' I don't want to associate with
people who think like that.''
</P>
<P>
   FISSURES, CHASMS, ISLANDS
</P>
<P>
   It was hard for Aqeelah, Kelly and Johanna to get together this
year. They had different lunch periods, different study halls. Only
Johanna and Kelly had any classes together. Johanna was on the
varsity swim team, Kelly was on the ninth-grade basketball team and
Aqeelah ran indoor track. The three could go weeks without getting
together.
</P>
<P>
   But they were still close. In the fall, when Johanna had big
news to share about a boy she likes, she was on two phone lines
simultaneously, telling Kelly and Aqeelah the latest.
</P>
<P>
   When they finally meet for dinner at Arturo's Pizza in November,
their pleasure in being together was visible.
</P>
<P>
   Aqeelah was a little late, so Kelly chose an orange soda for
her. When she arrived, they are their usual frisky selves, waving
to everyone who walked by and talking about the old friends they
didn't see anymore and the new people they felt friendly with but
would not yet ask to the movies.
</P>
<P>
   They were still in giggle mode when Aqeelah said, ``I get made
fun of by everybody,'' and Johanna broke in, ``Why, because you're
short?'' and they collapsed into laughter.
</P>
<P>
   But a second later, Aqeelah was not laughing. She had her head
down and her eyes covered, and when she looked up, a tear was
leaking down her cheek.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, it's really confusing this year,'' she said. ``I'm too
white to be black, and I'm too black to be white. If I'm talking to
a white boy, a black kid walks by and says, `Oh, there's Aqeelah,
she likes white boys.' And in class, these Caucasian boys I've been
friends with for years say hi, and then the next thing they say is,
`Yo, Aqeelah, what up?' as if I won't understand them unless they
use that kind of slang. Or they'll tell me they really like `Back
That Thing Up' by Juvenile. I don't care if they like a rapper, but
it seems like they think that's the only connection they have with
me.

COURT RULES AGAINST CUBAN BOY'S RELATIVES IN US 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADAM PERTMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Miami relatives of Elian Gonzales Friday lost what may be
their final battle to prevent the boy's return to Cuba. It now
appears he could go home as early as next week.
</P>
<P>
   The 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta unanimously
rejected a request by the relatives for reconsideration of a
three-judge panel's decision three weeks ago. The panel had upheld
the US Immigration and Naturalization Service's refusal to allow an
asylum hearing for Elian, saying only the child's father could make
such a request.
</P>
<P>
   The relatives' sole remaining opportunity for an appeal is to
the US Supreme Court. But the justices in Washington are widely
seen as unlikely to accept the case if they are asked to do so,
both because there is no indication of previous judicial error and
because the three-judge panel cited a Supreme Court ruling as the
rationale for its own decision.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the only surprise about Friday's seemingly
conclusive announcement from Atlanta was that it had taken so long
to reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels like it's been forever getting here, but it's
absolutely the right decision,'' said Karen Jacobsen, a specialist
in refugee and immigration policy at the Fletcher School of
International Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in keeping with American law and immigration policy. .
.and it's in keeping with what most people believe about families:
that a child belongs with his parent, and not with people he hardly
knows.''
</P>
<P>
   The 12 judges of the 11th Circuit evidently shared with many
observers of the case the feeling that it was time to write the
last chapter of a saga that has captivated the nation and sparked
international controversy since Elian was discovered floating on an
inner tube off the Florida coast last November. He had survived,
with two others, a disastrous boat trip from Cuba in which his
mother and 10 others drowned.
</P>
<P>
   After noting that an injunction preventing Elian's father from
leaving the United States with his son expires at 4 p.m. Wednesday,
the five-page ruling said the appeals court will not entertain any
more requests for a stay. The word ``not'' appeared in oversized
and boldfaced type.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction to Friday's development was muted, especially compared
to the intense and sometimes raucous response previous legal
defeats for Elian's relatives have prompted. The Cuban-American
community in southern Florida appeared quiet, and there was no hint
of gloating from anyone on the winning side
</P>
<P>
   ``We are pleased that the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals has
acted unanimously in denying the motion for rehearing,'' Attorney
General Janet Reno said in Washington. ``Now that the court has
conclusively upheld our decision, I am hopeful that this father and
son will soon be able to move on with their lives together.''
</P>
<P>
   Greg Craig, the attorney for Elian's father, released a short
statement that relayed the same sentiments. It said, in part:
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that the INS decision to recognize the right of
Juan Miguel Gonzalez to speak for his son Elian is consistent with
the rule of law and our nation's core values and traditions. We are
gratified that the 11th Circuit was unanimous in its decision to
affirm those values and those traditions.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig added that the elder Miguel and his family, who have been
living in suburban Washington awaiting a final disposition of the
case, ``look forward to resuming a normal life.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian has been in his father's custody since April 22, when
federal agents forcibly removed him from the home of his great
uncle and cousins in the Little Havana section of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   His relatives, who have lost every judicial decision in their
effort to prevent his return to Cuba, had argued that all 12 judges
on the 11th Circuit should rehear the case because the three-judge
panel drawn from their ranks had erred in its ruling.
</P>
<P>
   But the full court adamantly disagreed. Seven of the dozen
judges had to approve reconsideration in order for it to occur, but
none even asked for a vote on the question.

 MAPLEWOOD, N.J.: with me.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year this stuff didn't bother me, but now it does bother
me, because some of the African-American kids, joking around, say
I'm an Oreo.''
</P>
<P>
   Johanna and Kelly were surprised by her pain; they had not heard
this before. But they did sense her increasing distance from them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like she got lost or something,'' Kelly said. ``I never
see her.''
</P>
<P>
   Aqeelah had always been the strongest student of the three, the
only one in a special math class, one rung above honors. But by
this winter, she was getting disappointing grades, especially in
history, and beginning to worry about being moved down a level.
Math was not going so well either, so she dropped track to focus on
homework. She was hoping to make the softball team, and
disappointed that neither of her friends was trying out. ``I'll
never see you,'' she complained.
</P>
<P>
   All three, of course, have always had other friends, and they
still did.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Kelly's social life was with her racially mixed lunch
group. She felt herself moving further from some of her white
friends, the ones who hang out only with whites. ``It seems like
they have their whole clique,'' she said, and she was not terribly
interested in them. Against the grain, she was still working to
make friends with black friends, particularly with a basketball
teammate.
</P>
<P>
   Johanna found herself hanging out more with blacks, much as her
older sister had _ though not her brother, a college freshman whose
high school friends were mostly white.
</P>
<P>
   ``In middle school, there were black and white tables in the
cafeteria and everything, but people talked together in the
hallways,'' Johanna said. ``Now there's so many people, you don't
even say hi to everybody, and sometimes it seems like the black and
white people live in such different worlds that they wouldn't know
how to have fun together anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The three girls celebrated separately on this New Year's Eve _
Kelly with Jared, Johanna at a party with her family, Aqeelah at
her father's mosque for Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly still tried to bring them together. One Friday night, she
called Johanna and Aqeelah on the spur of the moment, and they came
over in their pajamas. And at Kelly's last basketball game, in late
February, Johanna and Aqeelah sat and joked with Jared, Kelly's
mother, her grandmother and little brother.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Kelly and Jared broke up. Kelly said she was sad
and working hard to keep up her friendship with Jared, but that's
about all she was saying.
</P>
<P>
   And as spring arrived, Kelly, Johanna and Aqeelah acknowledged
that, at least for now, their threesome had pretty much become a
twosome.
</P>
<P>
   Johanna and Kelly were still very tight, and did something
together almost every weekend. But these days Aqeelah talked most
to a black girl, a longtime family friend. It was partly logistics:
Aqeelah would run into her daily at sixth period and after school,
at her locker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why I don't call Johanna or Kelly,'' she said.
``They'll always have the place in my heart, but not so much
physically in my life these days. It seems like I have no real
friends this year. You know how you can have a lot of friends, but
you have no one? Everyone seems to be settled in their cliques and
I'm just searching. And the more I get to know some people, the
more I want to withdraw. I'm spending a lot more time with my
family this year.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not that Aqeelah was falling apart. She was still her solid
self, with all her enthusiasms _ for ``Dawson's Creek, '' movies
and the Friday noon service at the mosque. But increasingly, the
gibes about being too white were getting to her. One day, walking
to class with a black boy who is an old friend, she blew up when he
told her she had ``white people's hair.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just began screaming, `What's wrong with these people in
this school?' and everyone stared at me like I was crazy,'' she
said. ``Everyone, every single person, gets on my nerves.''
</P>
<P>
   LESSONS AND LEGACIES
</P>
<P>
   The story of Aqeelah, Kelly and Johanna is still unfolding. But
those who have gone before know something about where they may be
headed.
</P>
<P>
   Aqeelah's struggle is deeply familiar to Malika Oglesby, who
arrived from a mostly white school in Virginia in fifth grade and
quickly found white friends. Several black boys began to follow her
around, taunting her. Lowering her eyes, she recited the chant that
plagued her middle-school years: ``Cotton candy, sweet as gold,
Malika is an Oreo.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I knew what it meant the first time, but I
figured it out pretty fast,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Jenn Caviness, one of her white friends from that time, clearly
remembers Malika's pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Malika was in tears every other day, they just tormented
her,'' she said. ``We all felt very protective, but we didn't know
how to stop it.''
</P>
<P>
   Malika felt powerless, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't tell my parents about it, I didn't tell my sister,
but it was a hard time,'' she said. ``If you'd asked me about it at
the time, I would have said that there was absolutely no issue at
all about my having chosen all those white friends. But that's not
true. By the end of seventh grade, I was starting to be
uncomfortable. Everybody was having little crushes on everybody
among my friends, but of course nobody was having a crush on me. I
began to feel like I was falling behind, I was just the standby.''
</P>
<P>
   The summer before high school, she eased into a black social
group.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found a black boyfriend, and I kind of lost contact with
everyone else,'' said Malika, who now attends Howard.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, when Malika finished talking about her Oreo problem,
when Jason recalled his fighting days, when others finished
describing difficult racial experiences, a strange thing happened.
They looked up, unprompted, and said how much they loved the racial
mix here and the window it opened onto a different culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Columbia High School was so important and useful to me,'' said
Jenn, immediately after recounting how she had been pushed in the
hall by a black boy. ``It shaped a lot of parts of my
personality.''
</P>
<P>
   She and the others remembered a newfound ease as high school was
ending, when the racial divide began to fade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senior year was wonderful, when the black kids and the white
kids got to be friends again, and the graduation parties where
everyone mixed,'' said Malika. ``It was so much better.''

</P>
<P>
   Many parents say that is a common pattern.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an ebb and flow,'' said Carol Barry-Austin, a mother of
three African-American children. ``Middle-school kids need time to
separate and feel comfortable in their racial identity, and then
they can come back together. I remember when I wanted to give my
oldest daughter a sweet-16 party, she said no, because she couldn't
mix her black and white friends. But by the time she got to a
graduation party, she could.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, among the seniors, there was a striking friendship
between Jordan BarAm, the white student council president, and Ari
Onugha, the black homecoming king.
</P>
<P>
   They met in ninth grade when Jordan was running for class
president and knew he needed the black vote. Ari, he had heard, was
the coolest kid in school, and so he went to him, and in such a
low-key and humorous way that Ari was happy to help out. From that
unlikely start, a genuine friendship began when both were in
Advanced Placement physics the next year.
</P>
<P>
   This year, they had several Advanced Placement classes together,
and they talked on the phone most nights, Jordan said, ``about
everything'' _ homework, girls, college. Ari was admitted to the
University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School and Jordan to Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one looking at me would ever think I'm in Advanced
Placement,'' said Ari, who wears baggy Gibaud pants, a pyramid ring
and a big metal watch. ``Most of the black kids in the honors
classes identify with white culture. I'm more comfortable in black
culture, with kids who dress like me and talk like me and listen to
the same music I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Ari and Jordan have a real friendship, but a friendship with
limits. On weekends, Ari mostly hangs out with black friends from
lower-level classes, Jordan with a mostly white group of top
students. When Ari and his friends performed a wildly successful
hip-hop dance routine at the Martin Luther King Association fashion
show, Jordan, like most white students, did not go. And when Jordan
and his friends put together a fund-raising dance for a classmate
with multiple sclerosis, Ari did not show up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've tried to get him to white parties, everyone wants him
there, but he either doesn't come or doesn't stay long,'' Jordan
said.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan thinks a lot about race and has been active in school
groups to promote better racial understanding _ something he has
tried unsuccessfully to draw Ari into.
</P>
<P>
   And while Ari often visits Jordan's home, Jordan has only
rarely, and briefly, been to Ari's.
</P>
<P>
   Ari laughed. ``Hey, dude, you could come.''

   MAPLEWOOD, N.J. _ Back in eighth grade, Kelly Regan, Aqeelah
Mateen and Johanna Perez-Fox spent New Year's Eve at Johanna's
house, swing-dancing until they fell down laughing, banging pots
and pans, watching the midnight fireworks beyond the trees in the
park at the center of town.
</P>
<P>
   They had been a tight threesome all through Maplewood Middle
School _ Kelly, a tall, coltish Irish Catholic girl; Aqeelah, a
small, earnest African-American Muslim girl, and Johanna, a
light-coffee-colored girl who is half Jewish and half Puerto Rican
and famous for knowing just about everyone.
</P>
<P>
   It had been a great night, they agreed, a whole lot simpler than
Johanna's birthday party three nights before. Johanna had invited
all their friends, white and black. But the mixing had not gone as
she had wished.
</P>
<P>
   ``The black kids stayed down in the basement and danced, and the
white kids went outside on the stoop and talked,'' Johanna said.
``I went out and said, `Why don't you guys come downstairs?' and
they said they didn't want to, that they just wanted to talk out
there. It was just split up, like two parties.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, the girls started high school, and what with the
difficulty of mixing their black and white friends, none none took
on the challenge of a birthday party.
</P>
<P>
   It happens everywhere, in the confusions of adolescence and the
yearning for identity, when the most important thing in life is
choosing a group and fitting in: Black children and white children
come apart. They move into separate worlds. Friendships ebb and
end.
</P>
<P>
   It happens everywhere, but what is striking is that it happens
even here. In a nation of segregated schools, the South
Orange-Maplewood district is extraordinarily mixed. Not only is the
student body about half black and half white, but in the last
census, blacks had an economic edge. This is the kind of place
where people _ black and white _ talk a lot about the virtues of
diversity and worry about white flight, where hundreds will turn
out to discuss the book ``Why Are All the Black Kids Sitting
Together in the Cafeteria?'' People here care about race.
</P>
<P>
   But even here, as if pulled by internal magnets, black and white
children begin to separate at sixth grade. These are children who
walked to school together, learned to read together, slept over at
each other's houses. But despite all the personal history, all the
community good will, race divides them as they grow up. As racial
consciousness develops _ and the practice of grouping students by
perceived ability sends them on diverging academic paths _ race
becomes as much a fault line in their world as in the one their
parents hoped to move beyond.
</P>
<P>
   As they began high school, Kelly, Johanna and Aqeelah had so far
managed to be exceptions. While the world around them had
increasingly divided along racial lines, they had stuck together.
But where their friendship would go was hard to say. And like a
Greek chorus, the voices of other young people warned of tricky
currents ahead.
</P>
<P>
   DIFFERENT BUT INSEPARABLE
</P>
<P>
   On her first day at Columbia High School, Kelly Regan takes a
seat in homeroom and introduced herself to the black boy at the
next desk. .
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to be friendly,'' she explained. ``But he
answered in like one word, and looked away. I think he just thought
I was a normal white person, and that's all he saw.''
</P>
<P>
   She certainly looks like a normal white person, with her pale
skin and straight brown hair. But in middle school, she trooped
with Aqeelah and Johanna to Martin Luther King Association
meetings; there were only a handful of white girls, but Kelly said
she never felt out of place. ``Some people say I'm ghetto,'' she
said, shrugging. ``I don't care.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly, whose parents are divorced, had always had a mixed group
of friends, and since the middle of eighth grade had been dating a
mixed-race classmate, Jared Watts. Even so, she expected it would
be harder to make black friends in the ninth grade. ``It's not
because of the person I am,'' she said, ``it's just how it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Johanna Perez-Fox is intensely sociable; her mane of long black
curls can often be sighted at the center of a rushed gossip session
in the last seconds before class. As she sees it, her mixed
background gives her a choice of racial identity and access to
everybody. ``I like that I can go both ways,'' said Johanna, whose
mother is a special-education teacher and whose father owns a car
service.
</P>
<P>
   Johanna has a certain otherness among her black friends. ``If
they say something about white people, they'll always say, `Oh,
sorry, Johanna,''' she said. ``I think it's good. It makes them
more aware of their stereotypes.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, she was put off when a new black friend asks what race
she is.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are always asking, `What are you?' and I don't really
like it,'' she said. ``I told him I'm half white and half Puerto
Rican, and he said, `But you act black.' I told him you can't act
like a race, I hate that idea. He defended it, though. He said I
would have a point if he'd said African-American, because that's a
race, but black is a way of acting. I've thought about it, and I
think he's right.''
</P>
<P>
   Aqeelah Mateen's parents are divorced, and she lives with her
mother, who works for AT&AMP;T, in a mostly black section of Maplewood.
She also sees a lot of her father, a skycap at Newark Airport, and
often goes with him to the Newark mosque where he is an imam.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Aqeelah's enthusiastic good cheer kept her close to
black and white friends alike. But now, in high school, the issue
of acting black is becoming a persistent constant irritant.
</P>
<P>
   After school one day, Aqeelah and two other black girls were
running down the hall when one of them accidentally knocked a
corkboard off the wall. Aqeelah told her to pick it up, but the
girl kept going.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the matter with you?'' Aqeelah asked. ``You knocked it
over, you pick it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Why do you have to be like a white person? her friend retorted.
Just leave it there.
</P>
<P>
   But Aqeelah picks it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's stuff like that all the time, and it gets on my
nerves,'' she said later. ``Like at track, in the locker room,
there's people telling a Caucasian girl she has a big butt for a
white person, and I'm like, who cares, shut up.''

UN, EU DENOUNCE GRAHAM EXECUTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE LAURIA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The United Nations joined the European Union Friday
in denouncing the execution of Gary Graham as an uncivilized act
rejected by most of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The execution of Mr. Graham ran counter to widely accepted
international principles and to the international community's
expressed desire for the abolition of the death penalty,'' said
Mary Robinson, the UN's high commissioner for human rights.
</P>
<P>
   A letter from Robinson to Texas Governor George W. Bush on
Wednesday noted ``overwhelming international consensus'' against
the death penalty for juvenile offenders who ``lack maturity and
judgment.'' Graham was convicted of murdering a man in 1981, when
Graham was 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``More importantly,'' Robinson wrote, ``it reflects the belief
that children and juveniles are more susceptible to change, and
thus have a greater potential for rehabilitation than adults.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, the UN's Economic and Social Council adopted safeguards
against the execution of people who commit a capital crime under
age 18.
</P>
<P>
   The UN General Assembly has overwhelmingly voted to abolish the
death penalty several times. Islamic countries, as well as China,
Japan, South Korea and the United States, have voted in support of
capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said the UN's Convention on the Rights of the Child
bars capital punishment for crimes committed by youth. She said the
1990 treaty by 191 nations was ``one of the most universally
ratified human rights instruments.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States signed but has not ratified it. Robinson told
Bush that as a signatory, the United States was still ``obliged not
to violate the spirit and intent of the treaty.''
</P>
<P>
   Portugal, which holds the European Union presidency until July
1, also criticized the lethal injection administered by the State
of Texas on Graham. ``The EU is absolutely . . . against the death
penalty,'' said a spokesman for the Portuguese mission to the UN.
``The EU has tried to convince the US not to resume capital
punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   France, which will take over the six-month rotating EU
presidency, was stronger in its denunciation. Foreign Ministry
spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret said the French consul in Houston
intervened several times on Graham's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are dismayed by the news,'' she said in Paris. ``We
especially regret that the authorities in Texas knowingly took the
risk of putting an innocent man to death.''
</P>
<P>
   Gazeau-Secret added, ``We will make the campaign for a
moratorium on executions in the United States into one of the
themes of our presidency of the European Union.''
</P>
<P>
   Another letter to Bush, written by Raymond Forni, speaker of the
French parliament, said ``I cannot believe that the victory you
hope for, to lead the largest democracy on earth, should be paid
for with the blood of your fellow countrymen.''
</P>
<P>
   Italy's left-wing daily Il Manifesto featured a photo of Bush on
the front cover Friday under the headline, ``The executioner
doesn't let up.''
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, the case was avidly followed by the media. ``It does
not fit: The United States presents itself on the one hand as the
world police defending human rights, and on the other side it
carries out the death penalty,'' said German lawmaker Sabine
Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger.
</P>
<P>
   She called on the German government to ``make this detestable
topic the object of discussions with our American friends.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman at the US mission to the UN said that she was not
aware of any time that Ambassador Richard Holbrooke had been
confronted on the issue. Capital punishment has not been debated in
New York since Holbrooke became ambassador a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Even Yugoslavia, which is led by an indicted war criminal,
criticized the execution. ``If you look at Mr. Graham I don't think
there was any doubt he was guilty,'' Belgrade's UN envoy, Vladislav
Jovanovic, said in an interview. ``But we do not believe in the
death penalty.''

   A SHIFTING SANDBOX
</P>
<P>
   Johanna and Aqeelah met in kindergarten and have been friends
from Day 1; Kelly joined the group in fifth grade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody cared about race when we were little,'' Johanna said.
``No one thought about it.''
</P>
<P>
   In middle school, the main axis of their friendship was
changeable: In seventh grade, Johanna and Kelly were the closest.
In eighth grade, as Kelly spent more time with Jared, Johanna and
Aqeelah were the tightest.
</P>
<P>
   But at the end of middle school, the three were nominated as
class ``best friends.'' And while they saw their classmates
dividing along racial lines, they tried to ignore it. ``In middle
school, I didn't want to be aware of the separation,'' Kelly said.
``I didn't see why it had to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Most young people here seem to accept the racial split as
inevitable. It's just how it is, they said. Or, it just happens.
Or, it's just easier to be with your own kind.
</P>
<P>
   Sierre Monk, who is black, is the granddaughter of the great
jazz pianist Thelonius Monk and came to the Maplewood-South Orange
district from a mostly white private school in Brooklyn. When she
graduated from one of the district's elementary schools, she had
friends of all races. But over the last two years, she had moved
away from the whites and closer to the blacks. Now, in eighth
grade, she referred to the shift, sometimes, as ``my drift,'' as
in, ``After my drift, I began to notice more how the black kids
talk differently from the white kids.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a consensus that the split is mostly, though hardly
exclusively, a matter of blacks' pulling away.
</P>
<P>
   Marian Flaxman, a white girl in Sierre's homeroom, puts it this
way: ``You know, you come to a new school and you're all little and
scared, and everybody's looking for a way to fit in, for people to
like them. At that point, I think we were just white kids, blah,
and they were just black kids, blah, and we were all just kids. And
then a few black kids began thinking, `Hey, we're  &UR; black &LR;  kids.' I
think the black kids feel like they're black and the white kids
feel like they're white because the black kids feel like they're
black.''
</P>
<P>
   And Sierre does not really disagree: ``Everybody gets along, but
I think the white kids are more friendly toward black or
interracial kids, and the black kids aren't as interested back,
just because of stupid stereotypical stuff like music and style.''
</P>
<P>
   What they cannot quite articulate, though, is how much the
divide owes to their growing awareness of the larger society, to
negative messages about race and about things like violence and
academic success. They may not connect the dots, but that
sensitivity makes them intensely alert to slights from friends of
another race, likely to pull away at even a hint of rejection.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it is simply a misread cue, as when a black girl,
sitting with other black girls, holds up a hand to greet a white
friend, and the white girl thinks her greeting means, ``I see you,
but don't join us.'' Sometimes, it is an obvious, if oblivious,
offense: A black boy drops a white friend after discovering that
the friend has told another white boy that the black family's food
is weird.
</P>
<P>
   Marian Flaxman went to a mostly black preschool, and several
black friends from those days remain classmates. But, she said, it
has been years since she has visited a black friend's home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I feel like I'm the only one who remembers that we
used to be friends,'' she said. ``Now we don't say hello in the
halls, and the most we'd say in class is something like, `Can I
borrow your eraser?'''
</P>
<P>
   Diane Hughes, a New York University psychology professor who
lives in South Orange, has studied the changing friendships of
children here. In the first year of middle school, she found, black
children were only half as likely as they had been two years before
to name a white child as a best friend. Whites had fewer black
friends to start with, but their friendships changed less. But
blacks and whites, on reaching middle school, were only half as
likely as third graders to say they had invited a friend of a
different race home recently.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of middle school, the separation is profound.
</P>
<P>
   JOSTLING FOR POSITION
</P>
<P>
   Aqeelah, Kelly and Johanna refuse to characterize behavior as
black or white; they just hate it, they insist, when anyone
categorizes them in racial terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what makes Kelly and Johanna and me different is that
we're what people don't expect,'' Aqeelah said. ``I'm the only
Muslim most people know, and one of two African-Americans on my
softball team. There's Kelly, a white girl playing basketball, and
Johanna, when people ask if she's white or Puerto Rican, saying,
`Both.'''
</P>
<P>
   Most students are acutely aware of the signposts of Columbia
High's coexisting cultures. The popular wisdom has it that the
black kids dominate football and basketball, the white kids soccer,
softball and lacrosse. Black kids throw big dancing parties in
rented spaces; white parties are more often in people's homes, with
a lot of drinking. Everyone wears jeans, but the white kids are
more preppy, the black kids more hip-hop. Black kids listen to
stations that play hip-hop or rhythm and blues; white kids favor
rock stations.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the two cultures are in constant, casual contact _
and a few students cross easily back and forth _ in the end, they
are quite separate.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Coleman, a black graduate who just finished his freshman
year at predominantly black Howard University, remembers how the
cultures diverged, separating him from the white boy with whom he
once walked to school.
</P>
<P>
   ``The summer before high school, we just went different ways,''
he said. ``We listened to different music, we played different
sports, we got interested in different girls. And we didn't have
much to say to each other anymore. That's the time you begin to
develop your own style, and mine was a different style than his.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason's style included heavy gold chains, a diamond ear stud,
baggy pants and hair in short twists.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of high school, much of Jason's energy went toward
straddling the divide between hip-hop kid and honors student. He
was in frequent physical fights, though never with white students;
that doesn't seem to happen. Although blacks are now a slight
majority at the school, he, like many of the black students, felt
an underlying jostling about who really owns the school. And he
felt dismissed, intellectually and socially, by some teachers and
classmates.
</P>
<P>
   ``African-Americans may be the majority, but I don't think they
feel like the majority because they don't feel they get treated
fairly,'' he said. ``You see who gets suspended, and it's the
African-American kids. I had one friend suspended for eating a
bagel in homeroom because his teacher said he had an attitude. That
just wouldn't happen to a Caucasian boy.''
</P>
<P>
   White students at Columbia High have their own issues. Many feel
intimidated by the awareness that they are becoming a minority at
the school, that they tend not to share academic classes, or
culturally much else, with a lot of the black students. It is
striking that while there are usually a few black or multiracial
children in the school's white groups, whites rarely enter the
black groups.

<P>
   ACTING BLACK, ACTING WHITE
</P>
<P>
   Whenever people talk about race and school, the elephant in the
room _ rarely mentioned, impossible to ignore _ is the racial
imbalance that appears when so-called ability grouping begins.
Almost all American school districts begin tracking sometime before
high school. And when they do, white students are far more likely
than blacks to be placed in higher-level classes, based on test
scores and teacher recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, by any measure of academic performance, be it
grades, tests or graduation rates, whites, on average, do better
than blacks. To some extent, it is a matter of differences in
parents' income and education. But the gap remains even when such
things are factored out, even in places like South
Orange-Maplewood.
</P>
<P>
   Experts have no simple explanation, citing a tangle of parents'
attitudes, low expectations of mostly white teaching staffs and
some white classmates, and negative pressure from black students
who believe that doing well isn't cool, that smart is white and
street is black.
</P>
<P>
   It can be a vicious circle _ and a powerful influence on
friendships.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, as students notice that honors classes are mostly
white and lower-level ones mostly black, they develop a corrosive
sense that behaving like the honors students is ``acting white,''
while ``acting black'' demands they emulate the lower-level
students. Little wonder that sixth grade, when ability grouping
starts in South Orange-Maplewood, is also when many interracial
friendships begin to come apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sometimes bothers me to see how many of my African-American
friends aren't in the higher-level classes, and how they try to be
cool around their friends by acting up and trying to be silly and
getting in fights,'' said Sierre, who this year moved up to honors
in everything but math. ``A lot of them just aren't trying. They're
my friends, but I look at them and think, ``Why can't you just be
cool and do your work.'''
</P>
<P>
   At Columbia High, which is 45 percent white, ninth-grade honors
classes usually seem to be about two-thirds white, middle-level
classes more than two-thirds black, and the lowest level _ ``basic
skills'' _ almost entirely black.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has become especially delicate as the district has
become progressively blacker, as more students moved in from poorer
neighboring towns with troubled schools, and as the ranking on
state tests has slipped. Five years ago, a quarter of the
district's children were black; now, with blacks a slight majority,
many people worry that the district could tip too far. (Of course,
black and white parents tend to have different ideas about how far
is too far.)
</P>
<P>
   The schools are still impressive. Columbia High always sends
dozens of graduates, black and white, to top colleges. It produced
Carla Peterman, a black Rhodes scholar, and Lauryn Hill, the
hip-hop star, who still lives in town. This year Columbia had more
National Achievement Scholarship semifinalists _ an honor for
top-scoring black seniors in the National Merit Scholarship Program
_ than any school in the state. And last year it had an 88 percent
passing rate on the state high school proficiency test, three
points above average. Still, in a society that often associates
racial minorities with stereotypes of poverty, the district has an
image problem. Many parents _ whites, but also some blacks _ talk
nervously about ``those kids with the boomboxes out in front of
school,'' and wonder if they should start checking out private
schools or another district.
</P>
<P>
   It is not an issue only for white parents. Sierre Monk's parents
are watching her grades, and thinking that unless she is put in
honors classes in high school next year, they will move her to
private school.
</P>
<P>
   Sierre said she is comfortable with her white honors classmates,
even if her best friends now are black. ``I feel friendly to a lot
of the white kids, and still e-mail some of them,'' she said. As
she sees it, she can be a good student without compromising her
African-American credentials. Not everyone, she observes, has been
so culturally dextrous.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people think of the black kids in the top classes,
the ones who don't hang out with a lot of African-Americans, as the
`white' black kids,'' she said. ``I'd never say it to them, but in
my head I call them the white black kids, too.''
</P>
<P>
   LESSONS AND LEGACIES
</P>
<P>
   Malika Oglesby arrived from a mostly white school in Virginia in
fifth grade and quickly found white friends. Several black boys
began to follow her around, taunting her. Lowering her eyes, she
recited the chant that plagued her middle-school years: ``Cotton
candy, sweet as gold, Malika is an Oreo.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I knew what it meant the first time, but I
figured it out pretty fast,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Jenn Caviness, one of her white friends from that time, clearly
remembers Malika's pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Malika was in tears every other day, they just tormented
her,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The summer before high school, she eased into a black social
group.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found a black boyfriend, and I kind of lost contact with
everyone else,'' said Malika, who is now a freshman at Howard.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, when Malika finished talking about her Oreo problem,
when Jason recalled his fighting days, when others finished
describing difficult racial experiences, a strange thing happened.
They looked up, unprompted, and said how much they loved the racial
mix here and the window it opened onto a different culture.And they
talk about how the racial divide began to fade as high school was
ending.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senior year was wonderful, when the black kids and the white
kids got to be friends again, and the graduation parties where
everyone mixed,'' said Malika. ``It was so much better.''
</P>
<P>
   Many parents say that is a common pattern.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an ebb and flow,'' said Carol Barry-Austin, a mother of
three black children. ``Middle-school kids need time to separate
and feel comfortable in their racial identity, and then they can
come back together. I remember when I wanted to give my oldest
daughter a sweet 16 party, she said no, because she couldn't mix
her black and white friends. But by the time she got to a
graduation party, she could.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   This year, among the seniors, there was a striking friendship
between Jordan BarAm, the white student council president, and Ari
Onugha, the black homecoming king.
</P>
<P>
   They met in ninth grade when Jordan was running for class
president and knew he needed the black vote. Ari, he had heard, was
the coolest kid in school, and so he went to him, and in such a
low-key and humorous way that Ari was happy to help out. From that
unlikely start, a genuine friendship began when both were in
Advanced Placement physics the next year.
</P>
<P>
   This year, they had several Advanced Placement classes together,
and they talked on the phone most nights, Jordan said, ``about
everything'' _ homework, girls, college. Ari was admitted to the
University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School and Jordan to Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one looking at me would ever think I'm in Advanced
Placement,'' said Ari, who wears baggy Gibaud pants, a pyramid ring
and a big metal watch. ``Most of the black kids in the honors
classes identify with white culture. I'm more comfortable in black
culture, with kids who dress like me and talk like me and listen to
the same music I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Ari and Jordan have a real friendship, but a friendship with
limits. On weekends, Ari mostly hangs out with black friends from
lower-level classes, Jordan with a mostly white group of top
students. When Ari and his friends performed a wildly successful
hip-hop dance routine at the Martin Luther King Association fashion
show, Jordan, like most white students, did not go. And when Jordan
and his friends put together a fund-raising dance for a classmate
with multiple sclerosis, Ari did not show up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've tried to get him to white parties, everyone wants him
there, but he either doesn't come or doesn't stay long,'' Jordan
said.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan thinks a lot about race and has been active in school
groups to promote better racial understanding _ something he has
tried unsuccessfully to draw Ari into.
</P>
<P>
   And while Ari often visits Jordan's home, Jordan has only
rarely, and briefly, been to Ari's.
</P>
<P>
   Ari laughed. ``Hey, dude, you could come.''

 &HT;    Frustrated Mihm feels the sting of pre-draft scrutiny
 &HT;    By Mark Rosner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Orlando Magic General Manager John Gabriel has
two words for those who would offhandedly dismiss Chris Mihm as
unfit to play center effectively in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Daugherty.
</P>
<P>
   Gabriel considers Daugherty a cautionary tale for those taking
measure of NBA draft prospects. Daugherty, a college star at North
Carolina in the mid-1980s, was considered by some to lack the
toughness necessary to work near the basket as a pro. As NBA scouts
took measure of him, Daugherty was tattooed with the ``S'' word _
too soft. Based on that reputation, Philadelphia, which had the No.
1 pick in the 1986 draft, traded it to Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Daugherty became one of the better centers in
the NBA. He was a five-time all-star who averaged 19 points per
game before his career was cut short after eight seasons because of
a back injury.
</P>
<P>
   Gabriel, voted the NBA's top executive this season, says, ``I
think you have to be careful when you label people soft. I was part
of that staff in Philadelphia. We could have drafted Daugherty, but
there were concerns that he was too soft.''
</P>
<P>
   Now comes Mihm, the former Texas Longhorn, for inspection,
trying to detatch the same tag Daugherty had.
</P>
<P>
   When NBA scouts and executives look at Mihm, they see the rare
7-foot center who can shoot, pass and block shots; a young man _ he
turns 21 in July _ who has developed deft post moves.
</P>
<P>
   But some scouts also see a lack of passion. Can he develop the
moxie necessary to survive against Shaquille O'Neal, Alzonzo
Mourning, David Robinson and Tim Duncan? If not, is Mihm talented
enough to succeed anyway?
</P>
<P>
   Mihm's agent, Jeff Austin, considers himself well-versed on the
subject, having represented Daugherty and Robinson, who couldn't
shed the soft label until the Spurs won the NBA championship last
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard that for years about David,'' Austin said. ``It is
interesting, though, that you don't hear that about Tim Duncan, who
is placid and expressionless. I think Chris is very much like Tim
in demeanor.''
</P>
<P>
   THE COMPETITION
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, the 2000 NBA draft is a referendum on Mihm. Three
teams with top-five picks in the draft are fairly desperate for a
center: No. 1 New Jersey, No. 4 Chicago and No. 5 Orlando.
Vancouver, which has the No. 2 pick and a center with a large
contract _ Bryant ``Big Country'' Reeves, is considering Mihm as a
power forward. How much these teams value Mihm will be revealed by
their selections Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Mihm, who left Texas after his junior season, is competing for
draft position with three power forwards: Kenyon Martin of
Cincinnati, Marcus Fizer of Iowa State and Stromile Swift of
Louisiana State, all viewed as aggressive players. Darius Miles, a
recent high school graduate who plays small forward, also is
considered a possible top-five pick. Nets President Rod Thorn said
Wednesday that he is considering all five players with the No. 1
pick. But according to most media speculation, New Jersey will
either choose Martin or trade the pick, and Mihm will be selected
by either Chicago or Orlando. Teams are also considering Joel
Przybilla, a center from Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Mihm auditioned for Chicago in early June. Afterward, one
Internet sports site, citing an unnamed witness to the private
workouts, said Mihm was badly outplayed by Jamal Magliore, a former
Kentucky center. But someone else who attended the workouts
disputed that report, saying Magliore repeatedly hacked Mihm
whenever he tried to shoot, much like opponents maul the Lakers'
O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   Mihm appeared upset by the report during a press conference in
Chicago while attending the NBA pre-draft camp earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole idea is laughable. I couldn't have put up the
numbers I put up in college, averaging 18 points a game, if I was
soft,'' Mihm said. ``Teams came out to stop me night after night
with collapsing zone defenses and double- and triple-teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later, Mihm was still defending himself when he was in
Orlando for a workout.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one person's opinion, and it just got blown up,'' Mihm
said Tuesday. ``Half the people who say these things have never
seen me play.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Austin, ``What was reported is preposterous. Fortunately,
the people making decisions don't listen to Internet
rumormongers.''
</P>
<P>
   The intense scrutiny seems to have become a burden.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough,'' Mihm said. ``I want to do well. . . . There is a
lot of pressure to perform.''
</P>
<P>
   QUALIFIED PRAISE
</P>
<P>
   The NBA men who evaluate talent are known for deception around
draft time. Many readily admit to that. But for what it's worth,
several have openly praised Mihm, albeit some temper their
enthusiasm with questions or instructions about his desire.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando reportedly would take Mihm if he is available at pick
No. 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a great body, he knows how to play, and he's
well-coached,'' said Magic director of player personnel Gary Brokaw
after Mihm worked out in Orlando Tuesday. ``It's rare to see a big
guy who shoots it as well as he does.''
</P>
<P>
   Mel Daniels, Indiana's director of player personnel who twice
was MVP of the old American Basketball Association while playing
center for the Pacers, is impressed by Mihm.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has all the tools. He's a 7-footer who is strong, can block
shots, can score, can run,'' Daniels said. ``He's a great athlete
with a major upside if he comes in willing to do the things he has
to do to become a great basketball player.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll Dawson, Houston's executive vice president for
basketball, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you come into the league, these guys will kick your
tail,'' Dawson said. ``Then we see how you adapt. Chris is blessed
_ wonderfully talented. He's got the ability to do everything. The
question is whether he wants it badly enough. He seems to want to
play in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte Hornets scout Kip Bass believes Mihm can develop the
necessary edge. But Bass said you can never be sure about that.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been kind of a docile guy in college, and the hardest
thing to do is to figure out how big a guy's heart is,'' Bass said.
``You can't do that for a few years. If you could answer that
question `yes' right now, if you knew that he'd have that spirit
and heart, he'd definitely be the No. 1 pick. Either way, I think
Mihm's going to be a good player. He's got too much talent and
brains. He's going to get a lot better.''
</P>
<P>
   R.C. Buford, San Antonio's vice president and assistant general
manager, said it should not take long to determine how tough Mihm
is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a good chance we'll know a lot more about it
six months into the (first) season,'' Buford said.
</P>
<P>
   Buford cites Philadelphia center Matt Geiger as someone who
plays more aggressively than anticipated. Geiger, who arrived in
the NBA as a second-round pick without Mihm's skill, has developed
aggressiveness he didn't have in college.A LARGE VOID
</P>
<P>
   Generally, though, NBA scouts and executives have difficulty
comparing Mihm to anyone in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a believer in comparison evaluation, but I can't think of
one for Mihm,'' Gabriel said. ``I love him. But the best in our
business struggle to compare centers because there are none. Chris'
game is sort of unique. I like the fact that he comes into the
league at a time when centers need to step away (from the basket)
and shoot.''
</P>
<P>
   Perimeter shooting has become a handy skill for centers because
new NBA rules allow teams to play zone defenses on the side of the
court where the ball is located. Before the rules changed this
season, defenders could not double-team player until he received
the ball. Only O'Neal, an anomoly who is strong, quick and nimble
at 7-1, 345 pounds, regulary scores inside with two or three
defenders guarding him.
</P>
<P>
   Gabriel is right about the lack of viable centers in the league.
Sacramento's Vlade Divac, rated the fifth-best center in the league
by Sports Illustrated before the 1999-2000 season, has averaged a
modest 12.4 points and 8.7 rebounds during his career.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1990, only 13 have been selected among the top 10 players
in the draft. Just four of those have been successful: O'Neal,
Mourning, Duncan (a part-time center) and Dikembe Mutombo. All were
among the top four players selected the year they were drafted, but
that designation does not ensure success. Shawn Bradley, the No. 2
pick in 1993, has been an albatross for three teams, most recently
Dallas. Michael Olowokandi, the No. 1 pick in 1998, has yet to show
the Clippers they made the right choice.
</P>
<P>
   The success rate among players drafted since 1990 as centers
with the sixth through 10th picks has been frighteningly poor. All
seven _ Erick Dampier, Adonal Foyle, Reeves, Eric Montross, Luc
Longley, Felton Spencer and Sharone Wright _ have struggled or
failed to establish careers.
</P>

   At worst, Mihm should never have to worry about having to find
work. If the success rate at center is low, employment opportunity
is abundant. Every team needs players who can at least try to guard
the elite centers and grab a few rebounds. The NBA employs at least
a dozen players who have lasted more than 10 years as journeyman
centers, usually as reserves.
</P>
<P>
   Herb Williams retired from the New York Knicks this season after
18 years in the league, the last seven doing virtually nothing.
Charles Jones, formerly of Houston Rockets and four other teams,
lasted 15 seasons despite averaging 2.3 points and 4.5 rebounds.
Joe Kleine is still around, with Portland, after 15 seasons and
fewer than five points per game. When Will Perdue left the Spurs
this season, Spencer stepped in, albeit much less effectively.
</P>
<P>
   The job might be demeaning, but the pay is great. Even the least
effective backup centers make $1 million a year or more. Ten years
of NBA experience guarantees $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte's Bass doesn't think Mihm will have to live as a
journeyman.
</P>
<P>
   But Bass does suggest those judging the draft will need more
patience for Mihm than for Martin or Fizer, if for no other reason
than the position he plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be hard for Mihm at first,'' Bass said. ``One night he
will be playing against Shaq, one night against Robinson and
Duncan, one night Mourning. It's hard for a young guy to do that.''

 &HT;    Houston wants power forward but may have to trade up to get one
 &HT;    By Mark Rosner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Carroll Dawson, the Houston Rockets executive
vice president of basketball, figures the law of averages will
prevent him from making a blockbuster deal during this year's NBA
draft.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the Rockets stunned the league last year, acquiring
point guard Steve Francis, the second pick in the draft, in a trade
with Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   ``You only move up once every six or seven years,'' said Dawson,
whose team has the ninth pick this year. ``We moved up last year.''
</P>
<P>
   That will not stop the Rockets from trying. The Rockets, fairly
set in the backcourt with Francis, Cuttino Mobley and Shandon
Anderson, want to draft a power forward with some size. Last year
they drafted Kenny Thomas, a promising player but undersized at 6
feet 7 inches.
</P>
<P>
   To get what they want, the Rockets will have to make another big
trade and move up. The three most coveted power forwards _ Kenyon
Martin of Cincinnati, Marcus Fizer of Iowa State and Stromile Swift
of Louisiana State _ are expected to be taken within the first four
picks, perhaps the top three.
</P>
<P>
   Dawson said the Rockets are interested in Texas center Chris
Mihm, but that also would require moving up in the draft. Rockets
center Hakeem Olajuwon will retire when his contract expires after
next season. Kelvin Cato, who last season signed a six-year, $42
million contract to become Olajuwon's successor, has yet to
establish himself as a viable NBA center. Some with the Rockets
believe Cato could play power forward if the team had another
center.
</P>
<P>
   Pundits who prepare mock drafts have worked under the logical
assumption that the Rockets will not move up. They predict the
Rockets will take small forward Mike Miller of Florida or shooting
guard DerMarr Johnson of Cincinnati. Dawson said he understands the
rationale in those mock drafts.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can't find what you need, you go for the best player
available, which is probably a two (shooting guard) or three (small
forward),'' Dawson said.
</P>
<P>
   Drafting a small forward/big guard type like DerMarr Johnson
would provide the Rockets with insurance should they lose Mobley,
their second-leading scorer last season, to free agency.
</P>
<P>
   Under the NBA's labor agreement, the Rockets can retain Mobley
by matching offers from other teams for up to $3.8 million next
season. Only three teams _ Chicago, Orlando and the L.A. Clippers _
have room under the salary cap to pay him that much.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets are concerned that one of those teams might make
Mobley a substantial offer if they can not attract higher-level
players who are available: Tim Duncan, Grant Hill, Tracy McGrady,
Eddie Jones and Jalen Rose.
</P>
<P>
   Should the Rockets decide to take a second-tier power forward,
they can probably choose from UCLA's Jerome Moiso, Syracuse's Etan
Thomas or Olumide Oyedeji, a 19-year-old Nigerian who played
professionally in Germany last season.
</P>
<P>
   Moiso is a rare player who is taller than listed. UCLA lists him
at 6-10, but he measured 7 feet during the NBA pre-draft camp in
Chicago.

UN, EU DENOUNCE GRAHAM EXECUTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE LAURIA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The United Nations joined the European Union Friday
in denouncing the execution of Gary Graham as an uncivilized act
rejected by most of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The execution of Mr. Graham ran counter to widely accepted
international principles and to the international community's
expressed desire for the abolition of the death penalty,'' said
Mary Robinson, the UN's high commissioner for human rights.
</P>
<P>
   A letter from Robinson to Texas Governor George W. Bush on
Wednesday noted ``overwhelming international consensus'' against
the death penalty for juvenile offenders who ``lack maturity and
judgment.'' Graham was convicted of murdering a man in 1981, when
Graham was 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``More importantly,'' Robinson wrote, ``it reflects the belief
that children and juveniles are more susceptible to change, and
thus have a greater potential for rehabilitation than adults.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, the UN's Economic and Social Council adopted safeguards
against the execution of people who commit a capital crime under
age 18.
</P>
<P>
   The UN General Assembly has overwhelmingly voted to abolish the
death penalty several times. Islamic countries, as well as China,
Japan, South Korea and the United States, have voted in support of
capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said the UN's Convention on the Rights of the Child
bars capital punishment for crimes committed by youth. She said the
1990 treaty by 191 nations was ``one of the most universally
ratified human rights instruments.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States signed but has not ratified it. Robinson told
Bush that as a signatory, the United States was still ``obliged not
to violate the spirit and intent of the treaty.''
</P>
<P>
   Portugal, which holds the European Union presidency until July
1, also criticized the lethal injection administered by the State
of Texas on Graham. ``The EU is absolutely . . . against the death
penalty,'' said a spokesman for the Portuguese mission to the UN.
``The EU has tried to convince the US not to resume capital
punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   France, which will take over the six-month rotating EU
presidency, was stronger in its denunciation. Foreign Ministry
spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret said the French consul in Houston
intervened several times on Graham's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are dismayed by the news,'' she said in Paris. ``We
especially regret that the authorities in Texas knowingly took the
risk of putting an innocent man to death.''
</P>
<P>
   Gazeau-Secret added, ``We will make the campaign for a
moratorium on executions in the United States into one of the
themes of our presidency of the European Union.''
</P>
<P>
   Another letter to Bush, written by Raymond Forni, speaker of the
French parliament, said ``I cannot believe that the victory you
hope for, to lead the largest democracy on earth, should be paid
for with the blood of your fellow countrymen.''
</P>
<P>
   Italy's left-wing daily Il Manifesto featured a photo of Bush on
the front cover Friday under the headline, ``The executioner
doesn't let up.''
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, the case was avidly followed by the media. ``It does
not fit: The United States presents itself on the one hand as the
world police defending human rights, and on the other side it
carries out the death penalty,'' said German lawmaker Sabine
Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger.
</P>
<P>
   She called on the German government to ``make this detestable
topic the object of discussions with our American friends.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman at the US mission to the UN said that she was not
aware of any time that Ambassador Richard Holbrooke had been
confronted on the issue. Capital punishment has not been debated in
New York since Holbrooke became ambassador a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Even Yugoslavia, which is led by an indicted war criminal,
criticized the execution. ``If you look at Mr. Graham I don't think
there was any doubt he was guilty,'' Belgrade's UN envoy, Vladislav
Jovanovic, said in an interview. ``But we do not believe in the
death penalty.''

TWO IPOS GO SMOOTHLY: THEY'RE PROFITABLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANTHONY FLINT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Two Massachusetts companies with qualities once rare in
IPOs _ products and profits _ made modest debuts in their first day
of trading Friday, helping breath new life into the flagging market
for new stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Charles River Laboratories of Wilmington and Manufacturers'
Services Ltd. of Concord both closed more than 30 percent over
their offering prices of $16 a share in their debut on the New York
Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the successful IPOs are typical for the current,
more cautious environment. After several companies trading on
Nasdaq bombed recently with their IPOs, a proven track record and
solid financials have become critical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors have definitely become more selective about the
companies they are picking, and main criteria is profitability and
positive cash flow,'' said Omar Sacirbey, senior editor at IPO
Reporter, a Thomson Financial publication.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure I would say it's a return to fundamentals but
there is some nostalgia for a return to the old days,'' said
Randall Roth, research analyst at Renaissance Capital in Greenwich,
Conn., which does research on IPOs and runs an IPO fund.
</P>
<P>
   Charles River Laboratories, formerly a unit of Bausch &AMP; Lomb,
produces labatory animals that are carefully bred with diseases for
research use by pharmaceutical and biotech companies. Its shares
closed at $22, a 37 percent jump.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which operates 53 facilities in more than 50
countries, has been profitable since 1997. For the first three
months of this fiscal year, it reported $76.7 million in revenue
for net income of $4.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the company said no executives would be
commenting on the IPO Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers' Services Ltd., meanwhile, provides manufacturing
on a contractual basis for companies including Palm Pilot, IBM and
Hewlett-Packard, having bought up factories worldwide. Its shares
closed at $21.25, a 30 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very happy we were able to go public today and it
appears to be well received,'' said John MacInnes, vice president
and treasurer for Manufacturers' Services.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers' Services Ltd. has also been profitable, reporting
$207 million in revenue in the first quarter of last year for net
income of $103,000, although for the first quarter of this year the
company finished in the red $12.9 million on revenue of $332
million.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best features of the company's business is a two-year
contract to produce Palm Pilot hand-held computer devices. The
company started out with a solid business model of offering a kind
of ``rent-a-factory'' service, which is attractive for businesses
that prefer to contract out the actual production of goods rather
than operate manufacturing facilities themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The lead underwriter for both deals was Donaldson Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette Inc.

&HT;     PENTAGON SAYS CHINA ATTACK ON TAIWAN IS UNLIKELY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ China is building its military forces but is
unlikely to attack Taiwan for fear of undermining Beijing's top
priority of continued economic growth and garnering world prestige,
according to a new Pentagon assessment released Friday.
</P>
<P>
   From missile systems, to jet aircraft, naval vessels and ground
forces, China is designing weapons to transform what is essentially
a massive Third World military into a lean and modern fighting
force, the study concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing in recent months has threatened war on Taiwan, which it
considers a renegade province.
</P>
<P>
   But the Pentagon report said China's main national priority
``remains economic reform and development within an environment
that is both peaceful and stable.''
</P>
<P>
   Both goals would be jeopardized if China were to start a
military conflict with Taiwan, according to the assessment, which
is the Pentagon's annual report to Congress on China's military
potential.
</P>
<P>
   If China were to attack Taiwan, ``China would have to be willing
to accept the almost certain political, economic, diplomatic, and
military costs that such a course of action would produce,'' the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   Like most government predictions about future behavior of
foreign nations, the 20-page declassified summary of the report
hedged its forecast, cautioning that U.S. analysts couldn't
conclusively rule out the possibility that China would use military
force, either against Taiwan or the United States.
</P>
<P>
   China's military build up ``should not be discounted,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   China's military dwarfs Taiwan's. China has 2.5-million service
members. Taiwan's military, in contrast, has about 400,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   A weapons count shows Beijing with an overwhelming edge in
quantity, although Taipei's military gear is more advanced, with
much of it purchased from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   _ China has 4,500 combat aircraft compared with about 400 for
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Chinese operate about 65 attack submarines, including five
nuclear-powered subs, compared with four diesel submarines for
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   _ China has over 60 major surface warship while Taiwan has 40.
</P>
<P>
   _ China has nuclear weapons and a ballistic missile force
capable of delivering either nuclear or conventionally armed
warheads against Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   According to a separate assessment from CIA Director George
Tenet, China is developing a new class of ballistic missiles
capable of striking Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, China has received two modern, Russian-built
destroyers; it has purchased Su-30 Flanker bombers from Russia,
with delivery slated within two years, and received a fourth
Russian Kilo submarine
</P>
<P>
   But despite the numerical advantages, the report says, Chinese
forces will have ``only a limited capability'' to conduct sustained
offensive operations against Taiwan between now and 2005, mainly
because Beijing currently lacks the equipment and tactics to
conduct an amphibious invasion of the island, the report said.
However, between 2010 to 2020 China could begin gaining a military
qualitative edge over Taiwan, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon's report to Congress last year on the Chinese
military concluded that barring intervention by the United States,
China would defeat Taiwan in any armed conflict _ whether a naval
blockade, missile attack, outright invasion or air superiority
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   This year's report said Taiwan would need help fending off a
blockade, but might be able to combat an air attack. The new report
didn't discuss whether Taiwan could repel an invasion.
</P>
<P>
   This year's report also didn't address the scenario of a
potential massive Chinese rocket attack against Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, independent China experts told a House panel
that China's military buildup threatened increased tensions for the
foreseeable future with Taiwan and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absent some systematic change in China, we can expect in the
years ahead a steady level of military tension with Beijing, with
the real possibility of a crisis,'' said Arthur Waldron, a China
expert with the University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Another grim warning came from Larry Wortzel, a former U.S.
defense attachi posted in Beijing. He said Beijing ``refuses to
renounce the use of force to settle territorial disputes; it
continues to threaten the use of force against Taiwan; and it has
used force in the international arena on a number of occasions in
the recent past.''
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan separated from the mainland after a lengthy civil war on
the mainland between Chiang Kai-shek's government and the Chinese
Communist Party led by Mao Zedong. When the war ended in 1949, two
million refugees fled to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. position since 1979 _ when Washington formally switched
diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing _ has been that it
recognizes the government in Beijing as the sole legal government
of China and Taiwan as part of China.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration does not support independence for
Taiwan and soft-peddles its public support for the island. For
example, U.S. Cabinet officials are prohibited from traveling to
the island on official business.

 &HT;    Spurs may trade into first round
 &HT;    By Mark Rosner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The San Antonio Spurs do not have a first-round
draft pick, a condition they might try to remedy.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs would have selected 24th in the draft Wednesday if
they had not traded their pick to Chicago for guard Steve Kerr in
January 1998.
</P>
<P>
   If they try to move back into the first round, perhaps with a
pick in the early 20s, the Spurs can offer the two second-round
picks they hold, Nos. 41 and 54 overall. The 41st pick was acquired
in a trade with Dallas last year. No. 54 is the Spurs' own
second-round slot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've thought about trying to move up,'' said Sam Schuler, the
Spurs' vice president for basketball operations. ``It's not a great
draft at the top, but with all the foreign players and
underclassmen, it's a deep draft.''
</P>
<P>
   Why would a team trade out of the first round? Primarily for
salary-cap reasons. NBA teams are required to give three-year
guaranteed contracts to their first-round picks, regardless of
whether the players earn a spot on the roster.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs need look no further than their own draft history to
find an example of such trades. In 1999, holding the last pick in
the first round _ No. 29 _ the Spurs set up a trade with Dallas.
San Antonio picked Leon Smith, the troubled high school player from
Chicago, and sent him to Dallas for two second-round picks. By
trading their first-rounder, the Spurs avoided increased salary-cap
problems _ they are already over the cap _ that would have been
induced by drafting a player they did not think could even earn a
spot on the roster.
</P>
<P>
   This year is different, though. With seven players on the team
who become free agents on July 1, the Spurs could use some help,
either perimeter players or a backup center.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a couple of teams we've talked to who might be
willing to make the trade,'' Schuleer said. ``But it's probably a
draft-day decision when we see who's still available. You arrange
it and then see what happens.''

   MA-IPOS (Boston) _ Two profitable Massachusetts companies that
provide useful things -- lab rats for drug-makers and contracted
manufacturing services for computer companies -- help breathe life
into the flagging IPO market. Charles River Laboratories and
Manufacturers' Services attracted investors, in part, because of
the unusual distinction of turning a profit. By Anthony Flint. 800

   &UR; COVER STORIES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   LEVI-STRAUSS (San Francisco) _ With sales falling and profits
scarce, Robert Haas, the beleaguered chairman of Levi Strauss &AMP;
Co., struggles to preserve Levi Strauss as a clothing maker with a
conscience. Levi's announced results last week suggest only that
the company has slowed its decline. It therefore remains unclear
whether the company can endure with its legacy of social
responsibility intact. By Karl Schoenberger.

</P>
<P>
   BIZ-MUSIC (Undated) _ Why do business giants and would be giants
like Vivendi and AOL want to be in a business _ music _ that seems
to be imploding under the threat of new technology? Because it
isn't imploding; in fact, it's having its best sales year ever. And
besides, it's these companies, and not the mp3.com's of the world,
that have the power to manufacture popular culture. By Alex
Berenson and Matt Richtel.

   &UR; INVESTING &LR;
</P>
<P>
   INVEST-HEDGE-FUNDS (Undated) _ You might think that hedge funds,
those unregulated investment pools that are reserved for the rich
and powerful, had fallen out of favor after two of the most famous
managers, George Soros of the Quantum Fund and Julian Robertson of
Tiger Management, threw in their monogrammed towels. If so, you may
not be cut out to be a ``hedgie.'' By Patrick MacGregor.
</P>
<P>
   INVEST-INSURERS (Undated) _ While technology stocks have been
careening wildly, some ugly ducklings seem to be in the process of
transforming themselves into market darlings: The companies that
sell insurance on cars, houses and businesses. Suddenly, Property
and Casualty insurers look like bargains. By Joseph B. Treaster.
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   INVEST-SOFTWARE (Undated) _ The over-the-counter bulletin board
is a hazardous place for investors, where blasts of hot air about
obscure stocks and their supposedly dazzling prospects propel
shares into the stratosphere. Alas, these fliers usually fizzle
out. One of the latest balloonists is Save the World Air, a company
based in Australia that says it has the ``world rights to market
and manufacture the zero pollution-fuel saving device.'' By
Gretchen Morgenson.
</P>
<P>
   (Eds, budgeted earlier as INVEST-WILD-IDEAS.)
</P>
<P>
   INVEST-INSIGHT-EUROPE (Undated) _ It sounds a little weird, but
the Old World is a work in progress. Europe is in the throes of
change, and investors there are only beginning to benefit from the
Eurocentric capital markets system that is being built. Michael
Levy, head of international equities at Deutsche Asset Management
and manager of the Deutsche European Equity fund, talks about
Europe's economic future. By Kenneth N. Gilpin.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; INSIDE FEATURES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   MICROSOFT-FUTURE (Redmond, Wash.) _ ``We are on the brink of a
new computing revolution.'' ``As big a transition as from DOS to
Windows.'' ``Microsoft's Net Bet is Boldest Yet.''Lest anyone
possibly miss the point at the Microsoft Corp.'s big media event
last week, the captions in the slide show and demonstrations were
all designed to convey the notion that the company's strategy for
the future would be, in the words of another Internet company's
ubiquitous ads, ``big _ really big.'' By Sam Howe Verhovek.
</P>
<P>
   RETIRE-PROPOSALS (Undated) _ Few issues point up the ideological
gulf between the likely major-party presidential candidates more
clearly than their very different approaches to inducing Americans
to save more money for retirement. Vice President Gore proposes
that the government provide a subsidy of as much as $3 for every $1
that you kick in to your retirement kitty, a new entitlement
program designed to favor the relative have-nots. George W. Bush
will probably endorse a plan under which the kitty will be fattened
with taxes that currently helps finance Social Security. What is
remarkable, however, is what the two sides now have in common: a
recognition that the electorate wants the long-term adequacy of
Social Security to be debated instead of avoided. By Robert D.
Hershey.

   BIZ-BOOKS (Undated) _ Why can't companies get off the dime?
Jeffrey Pfeffer and Robert Sutton have studied the ways of business
for decades, and they come away puzzled as to why so many companies
fail to act on what they know. In their pragmatic book, ``The
Knowing-Doing Gap'' (Harvard Business School Press, 2000) Pfeffer
and Sutton offer the voice of experience about companies that know
what to do but just can't. By Fred Andrews.

   BIZ-ENTERPRISE (San Francisco) _ Enterprise Application
Integration software firms are the opposite of the Blue Chip
Technology companies that investors have been buying since the
spring selloff. They are extraordinarily volatile, have scant track

Webmethods, Tibco and Crossworlds also have the high octane growth
that can justify their valuations. And they are selling for less

   ECON-COLUMN (Undated) _ The United States seems to have tired of
using the fruits of American labor as a weapon in global politics.
In the span of a month, Congress eliminated China's annual trade
review and President Clinton eased economic sanctions against North
Korea. The State Department even dropped the term ``rogue state''
from its diplomatic lexicon: Libya, Iraq and Syria are now simply
``states of concern.'' Could the 38-year embargo on trade with Cuba
be next? By Joseph Kahn.
</P>
<P>
   MIDSTREAM-COLUMN (Undated) _ As baby boomers, we are getting a
reputation. We take heat for our questionable cell-phone habits,
the big trucks we drive and our overall obsession with money. Now
investment advisers are shaking their heads over how we invest. We
are, they say, incredibly risk-prone and oblivious to the lessons
of history. We know that, of course, and it seems that many of us
don't care. But not all of us. By James Schembari.

 &HT;    No survivors in airplane collision
 &HT;    By Marc Caputo
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOCA RATON, Fla._ A stunt airplane and a Lear jet collided in
mid-air Friday, killing all four people aboard as burning wreckage
crashed into a gated golf-course community.
</P>
<P>
   No one on the ground was injured when the debris rained down on
a one-square-mile area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw two balls of fire coming down,'' said Ivory McCall, a
43-year-old construction worker who watched the Lear take off and
explode moments later.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I could see was fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Lear jet pilot Richard Smith, co-pilot Kevin Reyer and observer
Brad Moncrief left Boca Raton Executive Airport about 11:40 am.
They headed west and planned to bank north in order to go to St.
Lucie County International Airport, where the new model Lear 55 was
to be repainted.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes before their takeoff, stunt pilot John Lillberg
apparently departed from Pompano Beach in a one-seat Extra 300
stunt plane.
</P>
<P>
   About 11:44, the two planes collided over the 17th hole of the
Boca Grove Plantation golf course. Pieces of the Lear rained down
near the 17th tee, not far from a startled foursome finishing their
round.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, 40, of Boca Raton, was a father of three boys ages 3, 6
and 8. His family had been planning a move to another house in a
new neighborhood and their old house was full of boxes, ready for
the movers. Moncrief, 29, and Reyer, 35, were single and lived in
Fort Lauderdale.
</P>
<P>
   Lillberg, 57, was a father of two girls, an adult and an
11-year-old. He gave flying lessons in Pompano and commuted to his
suburban Boynton Beach home by plane, friends said.
</P>
<P>
   The mangled body of one of the pilots _ officials suspected
Lillberg _ was found wrapped in what looked like a red-and-white
parachute.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a pretty sight,'' said 18-year-old Anthony
Mannarino, whose house the body landed near. Mannarino said he
wasn't awakened by the loud collision, but by the screams of his
house keeper as the debris fell down.
</P>
<P>
   James Kazek won't ever forget the sound and site of the crash,
which happened just above him as he drove down the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw two huge red balls of flame floating down to earth,''
Kazek, 56, said. ``It was an unbelievable site to see.''
</P>
<P>
   An engine from the Lear jet landed within 25 feet of a
three-story condominium and at least one building was damaged by
the ensuing fire. Smaller debris pelted roofs and yards.
</P>
<P>
   Rod Sirmeyer, a pool cleaner who was in the complex, said he
heard the Lear crash. He ran to the plane's cockpit and tried to
put out the fire with water from a garden hose while some
condominium maintenance workers sprayed it with a fire
extinguisher. Small explosions continued for several minutes, he
said. It was obvious, he said, that everyone aboard had perished.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just felt really sad for the people's families,'' Sirmeyer
said.

   GORE-FUNDRAISING (Washington) _ Vice President Al Gore said he
will make public the full transcript of his ``cooperative and
professional'' interview with a prosecutor who has called for a
special inquiry into Gore's veracity about his 1996 fund raising.
``I think the truth is my friend in this,'' Gore told reporters
Friday on his presidential campaign plane. By David Johnston and

that angered federal regulators and consumer groups. By Simon
Romero.
</P>
<P>
   ISRAEL-ARMY (Jerusalem) _ Near the ancient caves of Bet Guvrin
in Israel, there is a secret Palestinian village on a hill. It
consists of about 15 houses and a mosque. It is for Israelis only.
The village is a simulation, a three-dimensional stage set that the
Israeli army uses to train its troops in occupation techniques,
riot control and all-out battle. It is populated by soldiers
playing the roles of what an army official called ``the enemy'':
Palestinian stone throwers and police officers, even journalists
and housewives. For the Israeli soldiers trained there, the
experience can be dizzying. On the one hand, they are engaged in
active relationship with Palestinian troops in the West Bank,
riding together on patrols and sitting together in offices, sharing
data, coordinating arrests, jointly calming tensions. On the other,
they are readying themselves for a defensive battle against them
and their people. By Deborah Sontag. (1300 words).
</P>
<P>
   POST-HIGH-SCHOOL (Undated) _ Post-grad programs have been around
for decades at dozens of New England prep schools like Phillips
Exeter, Hotchkiss and Deerfield, mostly for male athletes who have
graduated from public high schools and want an extra year to bulk
up, get stronger _ and bolster less-than-stellar academic records.
The programs give prep schools some extra wallop on their sports
teams, new blood and greater diversity, not to mention tuition. But
over the last five years, with the competition for entry into
top-tier colleges growing more fevered than ever, the post-graduate
programs have begun drawing far more applicants and from a wider
pool that for the first time, includes a substantial number of
girls, and boys, less interested in athletics than drama, music, or
a more impressive academic profile. And public school officials
have even begun to talk of a fifth year of high school as a way to
help some students meet increasingly rigorous graduation standards.

HOUSE APPROVES SPENDING ON ANTI-TOBACCO SUIT 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN A. HOLMES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For the second time in a week, the House has voted
to permit the Justice Department to use money from other federal
agencies in its lawsuit against tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   By a vote of 215-183, the House approved an amendment by Rep.
Henry Waxman, D-Calif., that allows the Justice Department to
receive $12 million from the departments of Veterans Affairs and
Health and Human Services to help support the lawsuit. The measure
had been strongly supported by the Clinton administration and
vigorously opposed by the House Republican leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the efforts of the House leadership, 55 Republicans
backed Waxman's amendment, more than offsetting the 35 Democrats
who voted against it.
</P>
<P>
   Approval of the measure marks the second time this week that the
House has defied the Republican leadership and approved a transfer
to the Justice Department to help finance the lawsuit. On Monday
the House voted to block the Department of Veterans Affairs from
transferring $4 million to the Justice Department. The following
day the House reversed itself and permitted Veterans Affairs to
send the funds to Justice.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Waxman's amendment to a bill to finance the
operations of the Commerce, Justice and State departments removed a
provision that would have banned the Justice Department from
receiving money from any agency to help in the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this settles the issue,'' Waxman said after the vote.
``I can't see how any other effort in any other legislation will
succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say, however, that they fully expect additional
efforts to limit the funds available to the Justice Department for
its litigation related to tobacco. Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, has
inserted language in the Senate version of the spending bill for
the Justice Department that prevents the transfer of funds for the
suit.
</P>
<P>
   Republican efforts to restrict or eliminate financing for the
lawsuit is one of several issues that have prompted Clinton to
threaten to veto the spending bill for the Commerce, Justice and
State departments. Clinton has also objected to the amounts
contained in the bill for such programs as hiring more police,
setting aside more land for national monuments and making
contributions to U.N. peace-keeping efforts.
</P>
<P>
   With such threats hanging over this spending measure and others,
most lawmakers expect tough negotiations with the president as the
fiscal year winds down in September. So far, the House has passed
nine of the 13 spending bills that must be enacted for the
government to continue to function. The Senate has approved three.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's action was the latest in a long line of skirmishes over
the lawsuit filed by the Justice Department that seeks to recover
from tobacco companies the money spent on health care by the
departments of Veterans Affairs, Health and Human Services, and
Defense.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the subcommittee that oversees the Justice Department
refused to grant the department's request for a $20 million
transfer from those three agencies to help pay for the litigation.
At the time, Rep. Harold Rogers of Kentucky, chairman of the
subcommittee, told Justice Department officials that they should
pay for the lawsuit out of their own operating funds.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno has said repeatedly that without
being able to use funds from other agencies the Justice Department
might not be able to advance the lawsuit.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   After being rebuffed by the subcommittee, the Justice Department
unilaterally requested $8 million from the three agencies without
informing the subcommittee, according to Rogers' office. Justice
Department officials justified their action by citing a 1995 law
that allowed it to request funds from the Pentagon to help defend
the Navy in a suit brought by contractors for a jet fighter.
</P>
<P>
   As the subcommittee drafted spending bills to fund the Justice
Department during the upcoming fiscal year that begins on Oct. 1,
Rogers included a provision that prevented the Justice Department
from once again asking the three agencies for financial help in
pressing the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1995 law was passed, the Justice Department has made
21 requests for a total of $324 million from other agencies to help
in lawsuits. In 17 of those cases, the Justice Department was
defending agencies that were being sued. The tobacco case is only
the fourth _ and by far the largest _ of the cases in which the
Justice Department requested funds in a case where the federal
government is the plaintiff.
</P>
<P>
   On the House floor on Friday, few Republicans spoke in defense
of tobacco companies. Instead, those who opposed Waxman's amendment
said they believed the 1995 law merely permitted the Justice
Department to use funds from other departments to defend that
department, not to file suits itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The statute is for defensive purposes,'' said Rogers. ``The
government is not to sue willy-nilly.''

<P>
   The prom was last month, graduation was the second Saturday in
June, and Geoff Blumenfeld is now officially finished with Granite
Bay High School, outside Sacramento, Calif. But next fall, when his
classmates start college, he will come East for another year of
high school _ a ``post-graduate'' year at Northfield Mount Hermon,
a boarding school in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenfeld had other options: He was accepted at the University
of Colorado, the University of Arizona and San Diego State. But he
has his sights set higher, and like a growing number of young
people, he is hoping that a post-graduate year will win him better
choices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd never heard of a post-grad year until my counselor
suggested it, and I don't know anyone who's ever done it,'' said
Blumenfeld. ``I played both football and soccer last fall, and my
grades did take a southward turn. I'm hoping, if I work hard, to
get a 100-point gain on my SATs, have a really great football year,
and then get into the U.S. Naval Academy.''
</P>
<P>
   Post-grad programs have been around for decades at dozens of New
England prep schools like Phillips Exeter, Hotchkiss and Deerfield,
mostly for male athletes who have graduated from public high
schools and want an extra year to bulk up, get stronger _ and
bolster less-than-stellar academic records. The programs give prep
schools some extra wallop on their sports teams, new blood and
greater diversity, not to mention tuition upwards of $25,000 for
each student.
</P>
<P>
   But over the last five years, with the competition for entry
into top-tier colleges growing more fevered than ever, the
postgraduate programs have begun drawing far more applicants and
from a wider pool that for the first time includes a substantial
number of girls, and boys less interested in athletics than drama,
music, or a more impressive academic profile.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really burgeoned in the '90s, partly driven by the
demographics,'' said Jamie Robinson, an admissions officer at the
Kent School in Connecticut, where, he said, post-grad applications
have doubled in the last five years. ``There's a tremendous number
of kids, and tremendous amount of discretionary income, among the
class who'd be interested.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Public school administrators, including New York City schools
Chancellor Harold O. Levy have even begun to speak of a fifth year
of high school as a way to help some students meet increasingly
rigorous graduation standards.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the new popularity of the prep school programs is driven
by the increasing frenzy over college admissions.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been the most competitive college year ever, so the
trickle-down was really apparent,'' said Robinson. ``There are a
lot more kids and parents who want to groom it a little more. You
see B students with 1,200-1,300 board scores opting for another
year to do some community service, some drama, boost their grades.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it sounds like it could be a year of breathing room,
but it seems often to be a year for padding the curriculum vitae.''
</P>
<P>
   Pam Safford, the admissions director at Northfield Mount Hermon,
where applications for 70 post-grad spots have risen about 25
percent in the last five years, said, ``We have lots of kids trying
to tier up to an Ivy League school.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Of this year's class, I'd say only about half do sports,'' she
said. ``I'm hearing lots more parents say this is where they want
to invest their money, particularly if they've seen their older
kids go off to college not quite mature enough to thrive.''
</P>
<P>
   Students offer many different reasons for choosing a
post-graduate year: learning better study skills, exploring
interests they overlooked in high school, playing another year of
sports without using their NCAA eligibility, improving their SAT
scores, or gaining more distance from a troubled sophomore or
junior year.
</P>
<P>
   For many students, especially in parts of the country where
post-graduate programs are not well known, the transition from high
school to prep school can be complicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of high school, I got so tired of explaining it at
all the graduation parties,'' said Damien Chaviano, an Illinois
high school graduate who spent this year at Exeter and will attend
Middlebury College in the fall. ``It was just unbearable, so I kind
of passed it off as a small college in the East. Then in the fall,
my buddies would call at 2 a.m., out partying, and I'm sitting
there, studying for Saturday classes, just heartbroken. But I got
more of a grip on my study habits, and more focus.''
</P>
<P>
   As the post-graduate programs become better known, some are
getting to be as selective as top colleges: Exeter in New Hampshire
had nearly 300 applications this year for 25 slots, and Deerfield
had more than 140 for 20 slots.
</P>
<P>
   And while most of the programs are clustered in New England,
they draw applicants nationwide _ and overseas _ almost all from
public school students who have not had the experience of tiny
classes, campus living and close relationships with teachers.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``My classes had more than 30 kids,'' said Vivian Harbert-Erceg,
a graduate of McMinville High School in Oregon who will come to
Exeter next fall. ``At Exeter, it may be a dozen kids in a class,
and I'll get to study things like ornithology and marine biology
that a public high school like ours just doesn't have. I'm going to
do a lot of drama, and it will let me acclimate to the East.''
</P>
<P>
   Harbert-Erceg said she neither knew, nor cared, that the
programs traditionally were almost all male. The preponderance of
boys, most schools say, reflects the same developmental gap that
leads many parents to hold back their sons an extra year before
kindergarten.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of boys are a year behind girls developmentally and
socially,'' said Lisa Antell, director of admissions at Bridgton
Academy, a boys' school in Maine just for post-graduates. ``Whether
it's starting kindergarten or starting college, a lot of them need
that extra year to focus.''
</P>
<P>
   While it is still not common, a few students are choosing a
post-graduate program even after being admitted to the college of
their choice: Bryson Grover, for example, deferred admission to the
University of Virginia for a year so he could attend Deerfield
Academy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every one of my siblings told me that when they got to
college, they didn't know how to study, they didn't know how to sit
down and organize their time,'' said Grover, who feels uncertain
about his college readiness, despite completing a slew of Advanced
Placement courses at his Virginia high school. ``Deerfield has
dynamite facilities, like an awesome observatory. UVA will hold a
place for me, and I'll still have four years for the college
experience. I don't see any downside.''
</P>
<P>
   For many post-graduates, though, the programs are more a
fallback than a positive choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd applied to four schools where I thought I had a pretty
good chance _ Amherst, Williams, Middlebury and Colby _ and I
didn't get in anywhere,'' said Jared Passmore, a football star at
his Massachusetts high school who spent this year at Northfield
Mount Hermon. ``It was pretty awful. In high school I could get B's
and a couple A's without much work, and colleges saw that as not
applying myself, which was true. And I used to have this tendency,
when I was taking standardized tests, and filling in all those
ovals, to start thinking about football plays, and fill in the one
in the position I needed to make the play.''
</P>
<P>
   As a post-graduate, Passmore worked hard, improved his SATs _
and won admission to Swarthmore, one of the nation's most
competitive colleges.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's absolutely no way I could have gotten into Swarthmore
without this year,'' he said. ``It was really awkward at the
beginning. My friends were going off to MIT and Harvard. And I'm at
this place where they lock the dorms at 10:30 and turn the phones
off from 8 p.m. to 10 for study hall. But I'm very glad I did it. I
think I've matured as a person, and I think it helped colleges see
me as someone who's serious about what he wants to do in life.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Like colleges, post-graduate programs vary widely. Some, like
Exeter, are known for rigorous academic standards, while others are
celebrated for their athletics: Dozens of Division I college
coaches come to watch promising players at schools like Maine
Central Institute, and New Hampton in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, there's two groups of post-graduates on the team,''
said Jamie Arsenault, the basketball coach at New Hampton. ``There
are those that would go to college if they could, but they don't
qualify academically. And there's another group that come from
small schools, where they haven't been seen, so they need the
exposure.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Whether at New Hampton or Exeter, most post-graduate programs
are small, in part because having too many outstanding older
athletes _ by their very nature, ringers in high school competition
_ inevitably keeps some home-grown students who played throughout
high school from making varsity; many schools have limits on how
many post-graduates can play on a team.
</P>
<P>
   And as more musicians and actors have been drawn to the
programs, similar concerns are beginning to arise about featured
roles in school plays or chamber ensembles.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Often, students are referred to a prep school by a college
admissions officer who thinks they could benefit from a
post-graduate year.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I applied to Wesleyan, the director of admissions
suggested that I would be a good post-graduate candidate,'' said
Angelique Owanga, who moved to Atlanta from Zaire three years ago,
and will be a post-grad this year at Northfield Mount Hermon.
``When I got into the program, with financial aid, I thought it
would be right for me. I had a good grade point average but my
SAT's were not as good as I expected, and I want to do better.''

FATAL, FALLIBLE PENALTY 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Gary Graham's execution in Texas may yet have redemptive value
if it marks the beginning of the end of capital punishment in the
United States. More than many recent cases, Graham's displayed the
essential fallibility of the death penalty. He was convicted with
no physical evidence, on the testimony of a single eyewitness, and
given poor legal representation in a state with a troubled history
of unequal justice for black men, especially those, like Graham,
accused of killing a white victim.
</P>
<P>
   Graham's case attracted attention in part because of its
political patina. Texas Governor George W. Bush has executed more
people in his five years in office _ 135 _ than any other governor,
and now he is running for president on a platform of being a
``compassionate conservative.'' This heightens interest in Texas
cases just as Karla Faye Tucker attracted attention in 1998 because
she was the first woman executed since the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   The more attention is paid to individual cases like Graham's,
the more Americans are able to break through the complacency that
allows the mechanistic application of lethal injections and
electric volts.
</P>
<P>
   But Graham's case, chilling as it is, shouldn't obscure the
individual humanity of the 221 other people coolly put to death in
Texas since the Supreme Court declared capital punishment
constitutional in 1976, the 76 executed in Virginia, the 42 in
Missouri, the 48 in Florida, or the 28 in Oklahoma. As the death
rolls mount, so do the chances that states are making fatal errors.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, the public is rethinking its reflexive support for
capital punishment, and for good reason. A landmark study released
earlier this month by the Columbia Law School examined all capital
convictions and appeals between 1973 and 1995 _ nearly 5,500 cases.
The report said courts found ``serious reversible error'' in
two-thirds of the trials. When the cases were reversed or retried,
82 percent of the accused got a lesser sentence than death, and 7
percent were found actually not guilty of the capital crime. Once
the accused is executed, of course, the ``serious errors'' found in
such cases become irreversible.
</P>
<P>
   Defiant to the end, his appeals exhausted, Gary Graham said
Thursday: ``They are murdering me tonight.'' The only western
nation that still administers this barbaric punishment must look
inside its soul for reasons to continue a system that surely puts
innocent people to death.

BARAK TAKES A LESSER EVIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Prime Minister Ehud Barak's last-minute, coalition-saving
agreement Thursday with the Sephardic religious party Shas reflects
his determination to keep as the primary aim of his government the
pursuit of peace.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Barak's capitulation to the parochial demands of
Shas was hardly propitious. The deal means that Barak was forced to
side with sectarians against secularists in a fundamental dispute
that divides Israeli society.
</P>
<P>
   Barak gave in to Shas for the sake of the peace process. He kept
Shas in the government for a price that includes $6 million in
fresh funds for the party's indebted schools. Shas was also able to
escape oversight of the way it spends money on its school network.
Until Thursday's deal, that oversight had been exercised by a
secular minister of education, Meretz leader Yossi Sarid, who was
one of three ministers from his party to resign from the Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   The enmity between Sarid and leaders of Shas had become personal
as well as political. The secular, progressive Sarid had been
successfully distributing government funds to public schools in a
manner that made those schools more attractive to Israeli parents
who had enrolled their children in heretofore cheaper Shas schools.
Consequently, there had recently been a significant shift of
students from Shas schools to secular public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Shas leaders now may crow that they were able to get rid of an
implacable foe. The dovish Meretz Party could not stay in the
government after such a blatant surrender to Shas on the very
principle that defines Meretz's reason for being. Meretz leaders

possibility of making peace.
</P>
<P>
   The political logic that led Barak to this choosing of a lesser
evil was that Meretz, even though outside the Cabinet, will still
support a reasonable peace accord with the Palestinians. So, in
theory at least, Barak should still be able to call on a large
coalition for peace. In reality, he has learned that Shas is hardly
a partner he can count on.

2003. Today, however, there's mixed emotions about Honda. A

   KOREA-ANNIVERSARY _ SEOUL, South Korea _ Fifty years after North
Korea invaded the South, triggering a war that left nearly 37,000
American soldiers dead, the border dividing the Korean Penninsula
into Communist North and Capitalist South remains the world's last
Cold War fault line, a place where U.S., South Korean and North
Korean troops face off across the most heavily militarized border
anywhere in the world. For protecting South Korea for the past five
decades, the United States has secured a strategic toehold in
Northeast Asia, at the doorstep of China and Russia, and has built
an enduring alliance with South Korea, host of the 1988 Summer
Olympic Games and home to one of the world's strongest economies.
Now, North and South Korea stand at the brink of a historic detente
that could usher in the reunification of the divided Penninsula,
shifting, yet again, the geostrategic stakes for the United States.

   KOSOVO-PRISONERS _ MITROVICA, Kosovo _ There are reportedly more
than 1,500 Kosovar Albanians still held in Serb prisons without
being charged. Many of them were rounded up by Serb paramilitaries
during last spring's ethnic cleansing campaign. Serbs call them
prisoners of war, but their wives and mothers call them hostages.
The United Nations can do little to secure their release ? another
criticism people have about the U.N. It's a very politically touchy
subject. The cease-fire accords left out any mention of prisoner
releases, for a number of reasons. But now, families are left with
no recourse except to pay bribes and ransoms to get their relatives
out of jail, paying anywhere from $4,000 to $10,000. We tag along
and bear witness to one of these exchanges at the Kosovo-Serbia
border to tell the story of these families being reunited. (Coker,

   MEXICO-PRI _ MEXICO CITY _ The presidential election on July 2
has political observers and experts asking a rather unusual
question: What if the Instituational Revolutionary Party, the PRI,
doesn't retain presidential power after 71 years? If opposition
candidate Vicente Fox is able to topple PRI candidate Francisco
Labastida Ochoa, what happens to seven-decades of social
infrastructure? Is there a worst-case scenario? Mexico's
government-controlled unions used to bring out massive numbers of
voters for the PRI. They've declined in strength as Mexico has
become less centralized and authoritarian, so can they still churn
out enough voters to help the PRI's candidate win? This population
is a critical part of the PRI political machine. (Ferriss, Cox News

   HOWARD-FINSTER _ SUMMERVILLE, Ga. _ Word was out that the Rev.
Howard Finster, the godfather of saving souls, the hardest working

of the Garden of Eden, during last month's Howard Finster Fest, a
show and sale that offered a thoroughly mixed bag of 60 artists but
only one Howard. With the ailing 83-year-old artist recovering from
double pneumonia and congestive heart failure and battling
diabetes, many visitors worried it might be the last chance to see
Finster, get his autograph, hear one of his classic sermonettes.

ISRAELIS' USE OF MOCK VILLAGE FOR TRAINING ALARMS PALESTINIANS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Near the ancient caves of Bet Guvrin in Israel, army
officials say, there is a secret Palestinian village on a hill. It
consists of about 15 houses and a mosque. It is for Israelis only.
</P>
<P>
   The village is a simulation, a three-dimensional stage set that
the Israeli army uses to train its troops in occupation techniques,
riot control and all-out battle. It is populated by soldiers
playing the roles of what an army official called ``the enemy'':
Palestinian stone throwers and police officers, even journalists
and homemakers. In the year-old mock village, the army experiments
with techniques for controlling and reacting to violence in a way
that is meant to minimize the risk to Palestinian civilians.
</P>
<P>
   For the Israeli soldiers trained there, the experience can be
dizzying. On the one hand, they are engaged in active relationship
with Palestinian troops in the West Bank, riding together on
patrols and sitting together in offices, sharing data, coordinating
arrests, jointly calming tensions. On the other, they are readying
themselves for a defensive battle against them and their people.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is exactly the double mission we deal with,'' a senior army
official said. ``On one channel, we really know the Palestinian
officers on a personal level. On the other, we prepare for events
like those that took place in May.'' That was when Israeli and
Palestinian soldiers engaged in extended gunfire exchanges in the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wear two heads,'' he added, ``and educate the soldiers to
think two ways at once.''
</P>
<P>
   In a way that has alarmed Palestinian leaders, the Israeli army
has been putting out the word that it is gearing up for riots and
more as the negotiations advance and a September deadline for a
final agreement approaches. While the Israeli government is talking
peace with the Palestinians, the Israeli army is busy preparing for
violent conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gen. Shaul Mofaz, the Israeli army chief, warned last week
that his forces would use helicopters and tanks to quash riots, if
need be. ``Anyone who hurts Israeli soldiers will be hurt,'' he
said. ``And if we need tanks, tanks will come. And if we need
combat helicopters, combat helicopters will come.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, the army said it would start equipping West Bank
settlements with riot control gear, including tear gas and rubber
bullets. This horrified the Palestinians, although the settlements
are already armed with government-provided weapons and live
ammunition, and the army has trained an emergency squad of reserve
officers and soldiers who live in each settlement. All settlers
trained and armed are cleared by the security services.
</P>
<P>
   The reigning assessment of Israeli military experts is that the
Palestinians want their future state to be born through struggle.
They do not want ``their state to be handed to them on a silver
platter,'' a senior army official said. ``They want not an
independence war, but maybe an independence struggle.''
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian officials are labeling this kind of talk a ``bad
faith'' approach to the peace effort, which sours the mood on the
ground in the West Bank and adversely affects the negotiations
themselves. Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, speaking on
Thursday in Ramallah, said he had immediately alerted the
international authorities that the Israelis' bellicose talk was
irresponsible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We informed the United Nations, the European Union, the
American administration, Russia, the nonaligned countries, China
and Japan,'' he said. ``We explained to them that this is wrong,
not only for the Palestinian track. It endangers peace in the
Middle East.''

<P>
   A noxious new campaign finance loophole deserves to be closed up
fast, with the support of both Vice President Al Gore and Texas
Governor George W. Bush. But Congress often serves itself first.
</P>
<P>
   At issue are so-called ``stealth PACs'' operating under Section
527 of the US Tax Code. Most political organizations that file
under Section 527, including all regular political action
committees, also file with the Federal Election Commission, which
requires that donors be disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   But some groups claim that, while they are admittedly political,
they do not expressly advocate the election or defeat of specific
candidates and therefore don't have to register with the FEC or
reveal their funding sources.
</P>
<P>
   This loophole was pried open in 1996 and grew larger in 1998.
This year it has already become a gusher for many millions of
dollars. Groups ranging from the far left to the far right are
using it, with House Republican Whip Tom DeLay of Texas leading the
way.
</P>
<P>
   As with the ``soft money'' spent by the national parties, these
Section 527 groups argue that the advertising campaigns they run
aren't designed to influence elections. Often, this is a blatant
sham. In the last six weeks of the 1996 campaign, some $550,000 was
poured into three Kansas congressional districts on behalf of
Republican candidates, each of whom won by 5 percent of the vote or
less. Earlier this year, a mystery group linked to two Texas
brothers spent $2.5 million blasting Senator John McCain in key
primary states but said it didn't have to name its backers because
it is a Section 527 political organization.
</P>
<P>
   McCain lost the nomination but won a surprise victory last month
with a Senate vote to close the Section 527 loophole. Last week,
however, House Republicans rejected all proposals that might garner
bipartisan support. This is the reverse of what has happened with
the broader soft-money ban, which has passed the House but died in
the Senate for the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   Big money is hurting American democracy badly. Secret big money
is poison. If Congress has any concern for the voters, it will
close the Section 527 stealth PAC loophole promptly.

 JERUSALEM: Middle East.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a letter to Kofi Annan, the U.N. secretary-general, a
Palestinian representative warned that the Israeli army could set
off violence with its threatening statements. ``Such threats of
extreme force cannot be taken lightly as the fragile and tense
situation in the area could quickly destabilize and words could be
quickly translated into action,'' wrote Somaia Barghouti, a member
of the Palestinians' observer mission at the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli army says that it does not want to raise tensions,
but that it does want to be prepared. Military officials point to
the riots in May, which left six Palestinians dead as well as
almost 1,000 Palestinians and 60 Israelis wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli and Palestinian experts alike agree that those riots
demonstrated that Arafat will permit or even encourage violent
eruptions in the West Bank and Gaza. Israelis say he has used and
is expected again to use violence to put pressure on Israel during
the mood swings of the negotiations. And they note that, as May
demonstrated, street riots can get out of hand and end in
full-fledged gun battles.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian opposition leaders have pointed to the Israeli troop
withdrawal from Lebanon in May as evidence that armed struggle
might accomplish more than talk. Palestinian officials still firmly
advocate negotiation as the road to achievement, but they warn
Israelis not to test their reaction to threats of military might.
</P>
<P>
   Jabril Rajoub, the security chief in the West Bank, said Gen.
Mofaz's words were ``a declaration of war.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If he thinks his tanks and helicopters will be met by the
white flag of surrender, he is mistaken,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After initially inviting a reporter to visit the mock
Palestinian village in Bet Guvrin, Israeli army officials later
decided that the moment was ``too sensitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Many professional armies and police forces train in simulated
settings.
</P>
<P>
   But the idea of Israel re-creating a Palestinian village to be
used for military drills is a potentially explosive one against the
backdrop of this week's back and forth between Israeli and
Palestinian officials.
</P>
<P>
   Although the village opened about a year ago, its existence is
not widely known. ``You can simulate one-to-one what happens in the
territories,'' an army official said, ``how to use force, and if
need be, helicopters; techniques for dealing with riots, arrests.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is standard for us to provide training for warfare in a
developed area,'' he said. ``But we've never had such a realistic
setting before.''
</P>
<P>
   The village is just one part of the army's regrouping after the
deadly skirmishes between Israelis and Palestinians following
Israel's opening of an entrance to the Western Wall tunnel in
September 1996. During the tunnel riots, the stone-throwing and
rubber-bullet-shooting that typified the Palestinian-Israeli
confrontations during the uprising of 1988-93 gave way to exchanges
of live ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   The army established a project called ``low intensity
conflict.'' It is based on preparations to respond to more
sophisticated violence, involving not only automatic weapons but
also what Israeli intelligence analysts say may be a cache of
hand-held antiaircraft and antitank missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Most Israeli officers in the West Bank are now elite
ex-paratroopers. The jeeps and other vehicles are now armored.
Tanks have been positioned through the zones of conflict. Soldiers
are trained in how to be snipers and to protect themselves from
snipers.
</P>
<P>
   And the Israeli army keeps a live map of points of friction in
the West Bank that could ignite a conflagration, including the
village of Sulfit adjacent to the settlement of Ariel. The goal,
Israeli officials stress, is to anticipate and avert conflict. But,
they added, they have to be prepared for worst-case scenarios, even
as peace talks are supposedly aiming to end the conflict entirely.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think the Palestinians can conquer a settlement,'' an
army official said, ``but they can come to the fence and shoot.
That's why we have trained and equipped the settlers. We don't want
them to take on their own security unless there's an emergency. But
there might be an emergency.''

WEALTHIEST, BUT NOT HEALTHIEST

<P>
   It should come as no surprise that the United States ranked 37th
in a survey of national health systems by the World Health
Organization. This dismal rating comes even though Americans spend
more per capita on health care than the people of any other nation.
A controversy over a lung cancer test provides a window on why
lavish US spending does not necessarily produce better health for
more people.
</P>
<P>
   Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths, killing
157,000 Americans a year, and the five-year survival rate for those
who get the disease is 14 percent, about where it was 30 years ago.
It would seem obvious that early detection would produce many more
cures, a belief shared by Dr. Claudia L. Henschke of New York, who
has developed a test for that purpose. The controversy over her
work was reported in The New York Times last week.
</P>
<P>
   Smokers and former smokers, those most vulnerable to lung
cancer, are lining up to take the test wherever it is offered, even
though they have to pay the full $295 cost out of pocket. Most
insurers will not cover what they consider an experimental
procedure. Henschke wants to give the test to 100,000 people to
find out whether it actually reduces deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Other physicians are more cautious, remembering their experience
with a cruder, but similar, testing regimen 30 years ago. They
identified more cases of lung cancer, but could not bring about
more cures. In addition, widespread early testing would encourage
more biopsies and surgical procedures. Those costs, far higher than
the test itself, would have to be borne by private or government
health-benefits programs.
</P>
<P>
   Lung cancer is a devastating disease, and Americans have great
faith in the ability of new technology to save lives. While the
medical community is still debating how to proceed with the test,
the likelihood is that it will eventually be offered to many people
and that the costs will be covered by private or government
programs.
</P>
<P>
   However, expenses like these are one reason US health costs are
so high, and why many businesses and individuals find
health-insurance premiums beyond their reach. Forty-four million
Americans are uninsured, thus denying themselves routine check-ups
and other tests that unambiguously save lives.
</P>
<P>
   The World Health Organization, in its report, did not mention
the lung cancer tests. But it does contain at least one bit of
indirect criticism of the US system. ``A set of publicly funded
interventions in the United States cost about $21.4 billion per
year, for an estimated saving of 592,000 years of life (considering
only premature deaths prevented),'' it says. ``Reallocating those
funds to the most cost-effective interventions could save an
additional 638,000 life years if all potential beneficiaries were
reached.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States, being the wealthiest nation on earth, does
not have to reallocate anything to improve health care for its
citizens. It needs to make sure that every citizen is allowed to
participate fairly in the system.
</P>
<P>
   WHO faults the US system for inequity of payment, ranking it
54th in the world. Even when Americans are covered by health
insurance, many have gaps in coverage or have to pay much of their
medical costs out of pocket. If the lung cancer test ever becomes
an accepted procedure, those with litle or no insurance will be the
ones least likely to benefit from it. No wonder that despite its
lavish spending, WHO ranks the United States 24th in the longevity
of its citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Americans are ``early adopters'' of medical technology, in the
words of WHO, as shown by the popularity of the lung-cancer test
wherever it is given. The WHO report ought to be a reminder that
this overreliance on high technology to the detriment of universal
coverage is not the best approach to improving health. Rather, this
country needs to learn what others have long accepted _ the
healthiest societies are those that make sure all their members
have fair and ample access to the tools of medical science.

A WORLD OF IMAGINATION

   In just a few weeks the fourth installment of the adventures of
the teenage wizard Harry Potter will be released in bookstores to
the clamor of young readers, especially boys. This is a good time
to lament the entry of Hollywood into Harry's world, with its power
to appropriate images from our minds and formalize them on film.
</P>
<P>
   It was perhaps inevitable that the Harry Potter juggernaut _
20.9 million books in print, translations in 27 languages _ would
eventually succumb to spinoffs, logos, licensing rights, and the
rest. But shouldn't the imaginations of young children be
off-limits, somehow?
</P>
<P>
   Warner Brothers has announced it will be bringing Harry to the
screen next summer. Casting calls have gone out on the film's
official Web site for British youngsters to play Harry and his two
best friends, Ron and Hermione. Mattel and Hasbro have licenses to
produce a line of toys starting this fall. Can Dumbledore and
Severus Snape action figures be far behind?
</P>
<P>
   Soon a film image of Harry will be fixed in our imaginations as
indelibly as Yul Brynner as the King of Siam or Audrey Hepburn as
Eliza Doolittle, blotting out all other possibilities. This is a
shame. One second-grade teacher who liked to read installments of
Harry's adventures to his class described how the students shouted
him down when he tried to show them the small illustration that
opened each chapter. They wanted to keep Harry and his pals in
their own minds, in their own way.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Potter has become a phenomenon in part because author J.
K. Rowling succeeded where so much of the popular culture has
failed _ in getting preteen boys to sit still and read. Absorbed by
the story of a scrappy, vulnerable boy with extraordinary powers,
turned on for the first time to the special, silent, solitary joys
of reading, these kids do not need another movie, video game, T
shirt, or CD. Luckily, the new book is more than 700 pages _ long
enough to carry a child past a summer of vapid blockbusters at the
cineplex.

BEIJING'S ROGUISH BEHAVIOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Monday, June 26, 2000)  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   Reverberations of this month's summit meeting between the
leaders of North and South Korea are becoming audible elsewhere in
Asia. The president of Taiwan, Chen Shui-bian, declared last week:
``I sincerely invite the leader of China, Mr. Jiang Zemin, to join
hands and work to create a moment like the handshake between North
and South Korea.''
</P>
<P>
   Chen's invitation was an adept political gesture. Beijing
swiftly rejected any such dialogue, however, unless Taiwan accepts
the mainland's definition of the one-China principle. The
mainland's rulers were demonstrating that they are not about to let
themselves be swept up in the euphoria engendered by the new
prospect that the sundered halves of the Korean family may be
reconciled.
</P>
<P>
   With this rote response, this refusal to wriggle free of an
impasse in which they have trapped themselves, the leaders in
Beijing are making an unfortunate error. The stability they need to
proceed with domestic economic reforms would be enhanced if they
were to engage in a patient and polite dialogue with Taiwan. Such a
dialogue could also improve prospects for regional security at a
delicate moment for China and the rest of Asia.
</P>
<P>
   One irony of Beijing's inflexible stance is that the People's
Republic of China played the role of marriage broker between Seoul
and Pyongyang. Shortly before the hermit regime in the North
stunned the world with its warm reception of South Korea's
President Kim Dae Jung, the communist boss of the North, Kim Jong
Il, was summoned to Beijing to receive a preparatory pep talk from
Chinese leaders.
</P>
<P>
   According to reports filtering out of other Asian capitals, the
Chinese counseled North Korea's ``Dear Leader'' to be as effusive
as possible with his guest from Seoul and to show the world that
his regime is not the vicious, unpredictable rogue state it has
appeared to be.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing's motive was not mysterious. This spring, the Chinese
leadership was made apprehensive about America's drift toward a
decision to develop a defensive system against a small number of
intercontinental ballistic missiles from a rogue state. The rogue
state commonly cited as the most immediate threat is the one in
Pyongyang, primarily because North Korea frightened Tokyo, Seoul,
and Washington less than two years ago by firing a long-range
rocket directly over Japan.
</P>
<P>
   If the Americans disregard the technical problems in the
antimissile system they are testing and plunge ahead with
deployment, thereby scuttling the 1972 ABM Treaty, China will be
obliged to enlarge and modernize its small deterrent force of about
two dozen strategic nuclear missiles. There would then be a great
danger of Japan feeling compelled to annul its postwar security
doctrine and go nuclear. This is Beijing's worst nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   So China has a great interest in Pyongyang ceasing to be a rogue
state. What Chinese leaders are much slower to understand is that
they also have a profound interest in persuading the world that
theirs is no longer a rogue state.

&HT;     GORE RELEASES TRANSCRIPT OF FBI INTERVIEW ON FUND-RAISER 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARK HELM

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore, whose presidential campaign
has been rocked by calls for a new probe of his 1996 fund-raising
activities, on Friday released a 150-page transcript of his
interview with a federal prosecutor two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   It showed Gore heatedly denying under oath any wrongdoing about
his role in a controversial 1996 luncheon at a Buddhist temple near
Los Angeles. He has consistently said he did not know the event was
a fundraiser.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sure as hell don't recall having _ I sure as hell did not
have any conversations with anyone saying this is a fund-raising
</P>
<P>
   event,'' Gore testified. ``As to whether or not I had any
follow-up conversations that said, were we able to set up this
event or not, I don't think I did. But I may have ... ''
</P>
<P>
   Gore told reporters Friday on his campaign plane that he was
releasing the entire April 18 transcript because ``I think the
truth is my friend in this. I have full confidence in the judgment
of the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president, who was on his way to a fund-raiser in
California, added that he wanted ``people to judge for
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., who has been holding
hearing into campaign finance abuses, announced that the head of
the Justice Department's campaign finance unit had recommended to
Attorney General Janet Reno that a special counsel be appointed to
investigate the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   According to Specter, Robert J. Conrad Jr. told Reno that during
the interview that he and two FBI agents conducted with Gore,
questions arose about the vice president's truthfulness about the
luncheon he attended at the Hsi Lai Buddhist Temple in Hacienda
Heights, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The transcript shows that although Conrad questioned Gore on
several topics, he returned repeatedly to the temple fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   ``You were aware in late February (of 1996), were you not, that
there was a goal of raising $108 million by the DNC (Democratic
National Committee)?'' Gore was asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' the vice president replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then a couple of months later there is a DNC-sponsored event
at the temple and it didn't raise any fund-raising issues in your
mind?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not know this was a fund-raiser,'' Gore answered.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Reno refused to say Friday whether she will
appoint a special counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at her weekly news conference, she said only that any
investigation into the matter should be done ``carefully and
without commenting on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno also vowed that she would not bend to public or media
pressure in the case. ``If we let some in the media push
inappropriately without knowing the facts, if we let people think
that because they leak something they can pressure us into
decisions, that just won't work,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   According to congressional sources, Reno was angry about the
leak to Specter and has launched an internal investigation into how
it occurred.
</P>
<P>
   During the news conference, Reno also was asked about the timing
of the leak and whether it would affect the presidential race
between Gore and Republican candidate George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to make sure the investigation is done the right way,
that it is done to seek justice so it is done fairly so it does not
interfere with the democratic process,'' the attorney general said.
``I am going to do everything in my power to see that any decision
that I make is made without political influence from anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   This latest call for a new probe could spell serious trouble for
Gore, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, by raising
more questions about his veracity in the midst of the 2000
campaign. The appointment of a special counsel in itself would
provide new fodder for Republicans, and any such inquiry could
easily continue through the November election.
</P>
<P>
   After announcing the White House release of the transcript, Gore
raised questions about the timing of the recommendation and its
public disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the timing is a comment in and of itself,'' he said.
``Here we are four months before a national election ''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was suggesting political motives within the Justice
Department, he said, ``I'm not going to go beyond what I've said. I
think the timing speaks for itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also rejected suggestions that his April 18 interview with
the prosecutors had been confrontational. ``I have told the truth.
I have cooperated fully,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he did not think people would ``find anger reflected''
in his answers and that during the interview he ``concentrated on
being cooperative.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have admitted that I made mistakes in fund-raising but I
have always told the truth about this matter,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   During his campaign stop in Northern California, Gore attended a
luncheon to raise $500,000 for the Democratic National Committee.
At a dinner in San Francisco Friday night he was expected to raise
another $1 million for the DNC.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, on his way to a campaign stop in Alabama Friday, said the
questions about Gore's fund raising are ``indicative of what has
gone on'' in the Clinton administration. ``I reiterate my call for
a new tone in Washington, which is going to require a new
administration,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Conrad's recommendation puts new pressure on Reno, who rejected
an earlier recommendation from one of Conrad's predecessors,
Charles G. LaBella, as well as from FBI Director Louis Freeh, to
ask for an independent counsel to investigate Gore. She also
declined to do so after two preliminary investigations of Gore's
role in Democratic fund-raising telephone calls from his White
House office.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general has been strongly criticized by Republican
lawmakers and officials for past refusals to seek an independent
investigation of the Democrats' fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   Justice officials insist that the department's campaign finance
unit, set up shortly after the 1996 presidential election, has
``vigorously'' pursued all leads and has succeeded in winning 17
convictions. Conrad was appointed by Reno six months ago to head
the unit.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Reno declined to appoint an independent counsel to
investigate whether a former White House aide, Harold M. Ickes,
lied to a Senate committee about his activities on behalf of the
Teamsters union. In December 1998, she found no reasonable grounds
to seek the appointment of an independent counsel to investigate
President Clinton's role in the 1996 Democratic fund-raising
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who was previously questioned four times by campaign
finance investigators, was interrogated for four hours by Conrad
and the FBI agents on April 18.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has said that he was unaware that the luncheon, attended by
saffron-robed nuns and monks, was a fund-raiser, although he has
acknowledged that he knew it was finance-related.
</P>
<P>
   The event, which lacked the conventional trappings of a
fund-raiser such as expressions of thanks for contributions,
nonetheless raised $140,000 for the Democratic National Committee.
Much of the money was later returned when questions arose about the
donors. Longtime Gore fund-raiser Maria Hsia was convicted this
year of campaign finance violations, which included disguising the
true source of donations given by the temple's nuns and monks.
</P>
<P>
   Under rules that took effect last July after the independent
counsel law lapsed, the attorney general must appoint a special
counsel from outside the Justice Department when a criminal
investigation ``would present a conflict of interest for the
department.''
</P>
<P>
   An attorney named to the special counsel's post does not have
the same degree of autonomy as an independent counsel had under the
lapsed law. While a special counsel would be free to structure any
probe as he or she sees fit and to exercise independent judgment
about whether to bring criminal charges, the regulations make it
clear that the ultimate responsibility for the handling of the
matter remains with the attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   The only special counsel named under the new regulations is
former senator John C. Danforth (R-Mo.), who is looking into
whether the FBI contributed to the deaths of 74 people at the
Branch Davidian compound near Waco, Tex., and then engaged in a
cover-up.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Reno defended her decisions in 1997 and 1998 not to
appoint an independent counsel, saying she still believes she made
the right decision based on the information available for review at
the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to look at specific evidence,'' she said. ``If you look
at that and all that has come out based on the information we had
at the time the decision was correct.''

TAX UPHEAVAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Monday, June 26, 2000)  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The debate over whether to charge a sales tax on e-commerce
purchases has brought into high relief the essential unfairness of
the sales tax _ a patchwork of confusing and regressive levies that
vary from state to state. Some states exempt food or clothing from
the sales tax, while others do not, and still others try to make a
distinction between necessities and luxury items. In New York State
until very recently, marshmallow bits were not taxed because they
were considered a cooking item, but full-size marshmallows were
taxed because they were categorized as candy.
</P>
<P>
   The e-commerce debate, which has many governors who depend on
sales taxes from old-fashioned purchases in a dither because of the
potential lost revenue, has provoked second thoughts over the
wisdom of any sales taxes at the state level. While major changes
in state tax structures are hard to achieve, the question raises
important issues.
</P>
<P>
   Murray Weidenbaum, briefly Ronald Reagan's chairman of the
Council of Economic Advisers and long a fixture among academic
economists, has expanded the debate significantly with his
recommendation that both federal and state taxes be revamped by
exempting any investment from current taxation while making up the
lost revenue in higher income taxes. In a paper published by the
Center for the Study of American Business this month, he argues
that such a system would in effect be a tax on consumption without
the flaws of the sales tax. The advantage, he contends, is that it
would encourage savings and investment, which lag dangerously in
America.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts is fortunate among states for having a fairly
progressive sales tax structure _ exempting food, most clothing,
and other necessities. It is, as a consequence, less burdensome on
people with lower incomes and raises only about a fifth of total
state revenue. Instead, the state depends more heavily on the
income tax, usually a more equitable device.
</P>
<P>
   Other states on average get about a third of total revenue by
taxing a wider range of goods at heavier rates. Many of them apply
the tax to food and all clothing, which makes the tax highly
regressive _ weighing proportionally more heavily on low-income
households.
</P>
<P>
   This disparity among states' application of the tax, plus the
different tax rates from state to state, have also advanced the
argument against taxing e-commerce sales, since it would require
extensive cataloguing of each state's practices for applying the
tax and might generate a constitutional argument about whether
companies operating in non-sales tax states like New Hampshire
could be required to collect the tax.
</P>
<P>
   Weidenbaum's proposal would do away with all those issues, an
attractive feature. But his proposal is flawed by visiting its
benefit, deductibility of investments, primarily on higher-income
taxpayers since they do the bulk of investing. And it would replace
one complex set of rules, those governing the sales tax, with
another that would distinguish genuine investment from the
pass-through of funds through checking accounts or similar
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The sad political fact is that many Americans appear to prefer
sales taxes to income taxes, misperceiving them as the lesser of
two evils. The likelihood of getting 50 legislatures to embrace
such a change, plus Congress, is of a very low order. Weidenbaum
nevertheless has performed a useful political service by pointing
out the flaws of the sales tax _ flaws that electronic commerce can
only enlarge.

TIPS FOR HOME OFFICES
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: First of 2 sidebars; goes with Home Office main) 
By ANGELA LEMIRE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When setting up a home-based business, be sure to meet all legal
requirements:
</P>
<P>
   1. Check with your local city clerk and zoning, building and
safety departments for complete listings of home occupation
guidelines and restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   The City of Los Angeles zoning ordinance, for example, prohibits
certain occupations in the home, such as adult entertainment,
animal training, body piercing, massage therapy and others. The
city also prohibits home offices from displaying business signs,
receiving more than one client per hour, creating a public
nuisance, having more than one employee and operating before 8 a.m.
and after 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   2. Obtain a business license.
</P>
<P>
   Most cities, including the City of Los Angeles, require
residents to obtain a business license to conduct specific
occupations. License fees cost $25 for initial registration and $25
annually.
</P>
<P>
   3. If necessary, obtain a home occupancy permit.
</P>
<P>
   Some cities require one. The City of Los Angeles currently does
not.
</P>
<P>
   4. Notify your insurance agent.
</P>
<P>
   Make sure your home office has property insurance coverage, plus
any other coverage required for businesses, especially if you are
employing anyone in your office or receiving clients. Policies for
residential homes vary and might not automatically cover home-based
business offices.
</P>
<P>
   5. Consult an accountant or call the Internal Revenue Service to
find out special tax considerations and laws that pertain to
home-based businesses, as well as home offices used for
telecommuting.
</P>
<P>
   6. Before performing any construction or renovations _ either
interior or exterior _ obtain a building permit from your city of
residence. &QL;

AT HOME IN THE WORK PLACE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Package includes 2 sidebars) 
By ANGELA LEMIRE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You've decided to work from home.
</P>
<P>
   But with your kids running around, friends calling and other
household distractions, work is more challenging than ever.
</P>
<P>
   What you need is a home office. (No, a desk stuck in the corner
of the family room does not qualify.)
</P>
<P>
   Whether starting a home-based business or telecommuting _ as an
estimated 40 million Americans now do _ the trick is to create a
work space that's productive and receptive to visiting clients, yet
doesn't disrupt harmony in the household.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the obvious technical, economical, legal and practical
considerations, permanently bringing one's work home requires
careful planning around visual, physical, mental and personal
elements, says Anne Wait, president of the Los Angeles chapter for
the Association of Interior Designers (AID).
</P>
<P>
   ``More important than anything, you want to delineate your
personal life from your professional life,'' said Wait, who
refurbished her own garage in Pacific Palisades into a design
office more than a year ago. ``For my own needs, I wanted my home
office separate from my house as much as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Like a growing number of professionals, Wait moved her interior
design business from a commercial district into her home to cut
overhead costs and reduce commuting time.
</P>
<P>
   Not including self-employed or part-time workers doing computer
and Internet-based jobs, roughly 9 million telecommuters across the
nation now work at home, thanks in part to computer-based and
wireless technologies, which enable employees to submit work to
central offices from remote locations.
</P>
<P>
   And that number is expected to rise as jobs in the information
industry continue to grow, according to statistics published by
Herman Miller Inc., a Michigan-based, employee-owned residential
and commercial furniture company.
</P>
<P>
   In designing its home office line, the company conducted a
year-long field study of nearly 40 different home-based business
and telecommuting workers to determine the products and designs
that best fit a range of home environments, behaviors and work
trends.
</P>
<P>
   Telecommuting _ or working from home instead of at a company
office _ helps employees manage family and work obligations, cuts
costs for lunches, car maintenance and fuel, and reduces
job-related stress for some. Studies also show that telecommuters
take fewer sick days, report greater job satisfaction and improved
creativity.
</P>
<P>
   On the downside, blaring televisions, barking dogs, churning
washing machines, Aunt Sally's phone calls and children playing
within earshot can disrupt concentration and business calls.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, family members might find it difficult to have to
tiptoe around the house during a home-based worker's ``normal
business hours.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You definitely should try to put (the office) away from the
bustle of family life, especially away from children's
activities,'' said Lilli Kalmenson, a designer and owner of Lotus
Interiors, who has a home office in Tarzana. ``I used to have my
office as part of the family room, and that didn't work well at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   Laundry rooms, garages, attics, guest rooms, play rooms, dining
rooms and even walk-in closets have made successful transformations
to home offices, according to designers.
</P>
<P>
   ``With most families, it's more often a question of what room
you can spare,'' notes Kalmenson who, in her 30-year career, has
carved out a speciality in designing home offices, including one
for her client Toni Yamin of Calabasas.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, the office should be close to the home's main entrance
or have its own entrance to avoid leading clients or employees
through the house. And the room should function solely as an
office, not double as a guest room.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of where it is, a home office should have its own
phone line, to keep personal and business calls separate.
</P>
<P>
   Enough electrical outlets are needed to support some basic
plug-ins, including those needed for computers, printers, scanners,
desk lamps, fax machines, adding machines, fans or air
conditioners. And keep in mind that some household electrical
systems can get overloaded easily.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people don't think ahead that if you have a washing
machine or dryer running somewhere else in the house on the same
circuit (as home office equipment), you could have power
shortages,'' says Kalmenson.
</P>
<P>
   Some home office conversions require more physical makeovers
than others. Garages and attics, for example, might require
building code upgrades or new lighting, ventilation, insulation,
heat and air conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   To bring more natural light into her own garage, Wait installed
windows and french doors.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, some of her clients have installed windows in their
converted laundry rooms or walk-in closets, or have expanded
roof-lines in attic spaces, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the room or space, decor and style should be
tailored around function as much as personal preference.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to be a pleasant room to start with,'' said Kalmenson.
``Otherwise the work will not be productive. Productivity is
definitely related to the atmosphere of your working environment.''
</P>
<P>
   For lighting, she advises choosing lamps that best serve
specific tasks _ such as swivel floor lamps near drafting or design
tables. Also, use natural light as much as possible, and keep
computer screens from facing windows to reduce glare.
</P>
<P>
   Wait recommends making the room a ``light, bright, airy space,''
and using vibrant colors to lift spirits and bring a ``whimsical
feel'' to the room.
</P>
<P>
   And before business is in full swing, a good filing system and
storage space will be needed for office supplies, documents and
tools of the trade.
</P>
<P>
   When using available floor space, closets, floor and wall
shelving, it's important to create a system that safeguards
documents and products, as well as helping to organize them.
Designers encourage home workers to have some locking file holders
for sensitive material and to keep a fire-proof lock-box or safe
for backup computer files and important client documents.
</P>
<P>
   Kalmenson, who frequently pulls out design catalogs for clients,
mounted storage cabinets on walls to keep appearances neat. The
wall-mounted cabinets also maximized floor space, so she was able
to fit both a double- sided desk and design table in her office.
</P>
<P>
   Wait stresses that every home office should have a door.
</P>
<P>
   A door is more than a safeguard from curious pets, playful
children or house guests, she says: It obstructs the office from
view during ``off'' hours and reduces the temptation to finish work
during family time.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's people's biggest complaint when their office is shared
with the family room. You see your work out on Saturdays and
holidays, and before you know it, you're sitting there doing
work,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides physical boundaries, home-based workers should set up
mental boundaries to keep professional and personal life separate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretend like you're going to work,'' suggests Wait.
``Discipline yourself to be in your office during set times. Take
breaks and receive personal calls during that time. And if you have
chores, or a child to pick up from school, take two hours for lunch
to take care of personal stuff. You could always stay in your
office an hour later in the day.''
</P>
<P>
   And accept that the two worlds will inevitably overlap.
</P>
<P>
   Herman Miller researchers, who has studied hundreds of
home-based workers, found that business contacts from other time
zones sometimes called during family dinners, for example, and
children frequently needed rides home from school or practice at
set times every day.
</P>
<P>
   Boundaries are helpful, but remember flexibility is one
advantage to working at home.
</P>
<P>
   Added Wait, ``The trick to staying productive _ not letting
yourself get too distracted _ is that it just takes discipline. You
have to discipline yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   On that same note, designers recommend placing home offices as
far from the kitchen as possible. &QL;

BREAKFAST AT THE REGENCY? ARF COURSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK - Toto II, a white Bichon poodle wearing dark
sunglasses, sat nestled in her owner's lap while a waiter in white
gloves and tuxedo served her a bowl of scrambled eggs, rice, and
grated cheese _ The Great Dane Special, the menu called it _ with
Evian water and a biscuit on the side.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is her first breakfast at the Regency,'' the dog's owner,
Donna McDonald, said, explaining the shades. ``I wanted her to look
like a celebrity.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday was Take Your Dog to Work Day _ and the first day of a
new policy by the Loews hotel chain that not merely allows but
encourages its guests to bring their pets along, supplying dog
beds, bones, toys, dog-walking and -sitting services, and a doggie
room-service menu.
</P>
<P>
   The Regency Hotel is Loews' Manhattan flagship and it celebrated
the occasion by holding a swank breakfast for all dogs whose
masters were willing to pay $30 a pop (proceeds of which went to
animal charities).
</P>
<P>
   ``The Regency is the home of the Power Breakfast,'' Jonathan
Tisch, the president of Loews, proclaimed. ``This is the Power
Breakfast for dogs.''
</P>
<P>
   From 7 to 10 am, 65 dogs and their owners rambled through its
Park Avenue portals. There was Edie Falco of ``The Sopranos,'' with
her mixed yellow lab-white shepherd, Marley; Ishbel MacIntosh of
the Discovery Channel's ``Epicurious'' with her shorthair,
Velvetine; Joseph Montebello, creative director of Harper Collins
publishers, with his two West Highland terriers, Porsche and Emma.
</P>
<P>
   All around, there were golden retrievers, miniature schnauzers,
Wheaton terriers, Brittanys, Keeshond Eskimos, Shi-Tzus, Canaans _
a very Upper East Side crowd _ rolling, noshing, slurping, and
sniffing as if they owned the place.
</P>
<P>
   Similar events took place in other cities. Take Your Dog to Work
Day is an attempt at a national holiday, the brainchild of
Pets.com, a pet supply web site. ``Bark breakfasts'' were held in
all 15 of the Loews hotels around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the affair in New York had its own distinct air, as does
this city's canine culture generally.
</P>
<P>
   Three things contribute to a strange environment for dogs, at
least in the borough of Manhattan: (1) the presence of many rich
and busy people most of whom (2) live in relatively cramped
apartments and (3) have _ except for those who live near Central
Park, where dogs can frolic off-leash before 9 a.m. and after
sundown _ no place to walk their dogs but concrete sidewalks.
</P>
<P>
   As if to compensate for these burdens, New Yorkers tend to
splurge on their canines where they can.
</P>
<P>
   The Manhattan Yellow Pages lists 23 day-care camps for dogs,
some of them as posh in their own ways as camps for human kids. The
Sutton Dog Parlour, just a few blocks east of the Regency, offers
outdoor sandboxes, playhouses, swimming pools, even a little park
with a (much-used) fire hydrant, as well as indoor games when the
weather gets bad, all for $20 to $25 a day, depending on the dog's
size.
</P>
<P>
   For about the same price, Paws Inn, in Chelsea, also has a
fenced-in roof and rooms full of couches where dogs can sit around
a television that plays ``Lassie'' tapes.
</P>
<P>
   Other such places include Canine Country, Run Spot Inc.,
Doggie-Do, and Yuppie Puppy. At each, between 20 and 40 dogs are
dropped off nearly every weekday morning, and picked up every
night.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Cerbi, owner of Camp Canine, on the Upper West Side, said
most of his customers are single or childless couples. ``It's a
godsend for these people,'' he said. ``Otherwise, their dogs would
sit home, chewing on the furniture and going nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York Department of Health counts 107,753 registered dogs
in the city _ 25,714 in Manhattan alone, or about one dog for every
30 households. But officials privately estimate the unlicensed dogs
would double or triple that number.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Kaplan, author of ``The New York Dog Owners' Guide,''
figures the number is growing. ``There's an increase of
dog-ownership with an increase of affluence,'' she said. ``I see a
lot more dogs than I did five years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   In a crowded city where dogs and people constantly rub up
against one another, Kaplan theorizes that the city's dogs fill a
unique social function. ``The reason to have a dog in New York City
_ assuming you like dogs _ is they are an absolutely fantastic way
to socialize,'' she said. ``When you first move to New York, it can
be a lonely place. Walking a dog in the park or down the street,
you end up talking with other dogowners, you get to know when
they're out walking their dogs. It makes New York more like a
little village, it brings the city down to a human scale.''
</P>
<P>
   Pets.com has tried to sell corporations on Take Your Dog to Work
Day with precisely this argument _ that what's good for Fido is
good for business. Its brochures cite a study by the American Pet
Products Manufacturers Association, concluding that dogs in the
office reduce employees' stress level, blood pressure, absentee
rate _ and increase the amount of work that gets done.
</P>
<P>
   The sell seems to be working. ``We received 3,000 e-mails from
companies interested in officially recognizing the day.''

SELF-MADE RECORD MOGULS ON THE WEB
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
 
By DAVID BLOOM 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's an old story: boy meets record label; boy signs deal with
record label; boy's albums, on first or second or 28th try, don't
sell as well as record label likes; boy loses deal, record label
and any residual goodwill toward music business in one conjoined
swoop.
</P>
<P>
   This story (substitute ``boy'' freely with ``sensitive girl
singer/songwriter,'' ``eardrum-busting metal band,'' ``gangsta rap
collective,'' etc.) is repeated so often in the music business that
it's a wonder anyone is left in the music business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The record industry traditionally is not geared toward legacy
artists, people who get older but still have an audience,'' said
Todd Rundgren, a long-time musician and producer. ``Every artist in
my situation ends up this way after 25 years: a household name who
just barely gets a deal on (eclectic independent label) Rykodisc.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Rundgren can take credit for five Top 40 hits and many
music-technology firsts, he released his newest album this month
without a major-label deal he could stomach. And he's hardly alone,
said Ric Dube, an analyst for Webnoize, a Cambridge, Mass.,-based
consultant on music and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rundgren's situation is a good (example); there are a lot of
artists of his sort, who have a few hundred fans in every city,''
said Dube.
</P>
<P>
   That sort of fan base won't keep a big record label happy, and
in fact, the Big Four have jettisoned huge numbers of such artists
from their rosters in recent years as the industry has
consolidated.
</P>
<P>
   But thanks to the Web, those veterans are finding they can make
a decent to good living without relying on often-indifferent big
record labels and mainstream radio stations, both of which are
focused on a relative handful of big-selling hitmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Rundgren, in his typical DIY fashion, created a whole new way
for his fans to support his work with Patronet, a Web service where
fans pay $40 a year to help support his work.
</P>
<P>
   In return, they get ``MIDI files (a standard file format for
electronic music), chat forums, Video On Demand, things I write and
screen, regular mailings, events that only subscribers participate
in,'' Rundgren said. ``They get a whole variety of things to
experience and download.''
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, said Patronet President Stuart Shapiro, fans become
``mini-Medicis,'' sponsoring their favorite artist's ongoing work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our service is for the devoted fans in our fan base,'' Shapiro
said. ``It's a private club.''
</P>
<P>
   Rundgren just sold Patronet to Artistent so he could concentrate
on making music, while allowing the company to work with other
veteran artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a hundred artists that this applies to right now,''
Shapiro said. ``They have a devoted fan base, probably don't have a
contract, sell 25,000 to 100,000 albums, but they have no value to
the conglomerates. They still tour, they still write music, they
still have fans. What do they do?''
</P>
<P>
   For country music veteran Charlie Daniels, using the Web wasn't
a choice three years ago. Frustrated with label executives who
didn't know his band's work, he went his own way, setting up
www.charliedaniels.com and Blue Hat Records.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Hat just released his latest, ``Road Dogs,'' a throwback to
his 1970s music created without the big-label meddling that drove
him nuts the last few years there.
</P>
<P>
   And on Daniels' Web site, fans can buy his Blue Hat records and
merchandise like hats and T-shirts, check tour information, hear
bits of his music and read a weekly column by Daniels that covers
everything from politics to ``what a beautiful spring day it is.''
</P>
<P>
   In effect, what Rundgren, Daniels and others are doing is using
the Web to create supercharged versions of the old fan club, though
the Web allows far more to be done, far more personally and far
more cheaply, said Rich Holtzman, vice president of marketing for
the Web-oriented label Atomic Pop (at www.atomicpop.com).
</P>
<P>
   ``If the artist is comfortable with opening up others to their
creative process, you can create a wonderful place for fan to come
visit,'' said Holtzman. ``It's really an advantage for the artist
because now they can be closer and more personal with their fans
than ever before but with less investment of time. You can go
directly to those consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Atomic Pop's best known artist is Chuck D, the fiery rap
producer and leader of Public Enemy, whose most recent album has
sold more than 100,000 copies. Unlike a bigger record company,
Holtzman said, Atomic Pop is still pushing the record a year after
it was released, something his company can easily and cheaply do
through the Web.
</P>
<P>
   And Chuck D has used Atomic Pop's resources in novel ways to
connect with his fans, recently setting up a weekly Internet show
called ``Bring the Noise'' (at www.btn.com) that features his and
other people's music, guest interviews and more.
</P>
<P>
   It's not always easy selling records on the Web, because big
labels and big radio stations still command the kind of marketing
muscle and audience reach that translates into big sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardest thing is getting your music to people through
radio because (the stations) are so strictly formatted and
consulted,'' said Daniels. ``The thing for people like Todd and us
and the Marshall Tucker Band, we're still playing dates to
thousands of people. But we can't get (our music) on radio. We have
to nip at their heels a bit and go through the backdoor'' of the
Net.
</P>
<P>
   But actually, Daniels and Dube said, artists can make more money
on their recordings, despite selling fewer records, because they
can keep so much more of the money from each record sold.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this sort of model, if you can make it work, the artist
instead of selling 100,000 records, can sell 5,000 and make
money,'' Dube said.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason why that's possible is that technology has
allowed artists to shortcut many of album-making's traditional
expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Computers are recording studios, and pressing plants, and
warehouses now,'' Dube said. ``There are no production costs. In
the old world, if you wanted to put out a record, the first thing
you needed to know was how many records you were going to sell, so
you'd know how many to press. Which seems insane.''
</P>
<P>
   The Web works best for established artists who already have a
well of fans to dip into, but you don't need a huge name to have
some nice success.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way that the Internet has changed the dialogue has had a
good effect on music,'' Rundgren said. ``The blind assumption was
that no one would succeed without a record company behind them.
That changed when Korn got signed. They had already built up a
devoted audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Bands like Creed and Korn used the Net to build a base of fans
and keep them connected to the band's doings. Other artists have
used the Web simply to keep in touch.
</P>
<P>
   English singer/songwriter David Gray recorded three albums in
the mid-1990s before undergoing the standard breakup story with his
North American labels, then had to shelve one album and go without
North American distribution for another, 1998's ``White Ladder,''
even though the album went platinum eight times over in Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   To stay in contact with his fans, particularly those who didn't
have access to his newer work, Gray set up www.davidgray.com, with
discussion areas, e-mail and tour information.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was staggered by what happened,' Gray said. ``When the site
was set up, people from all over the world got on to it. We had a
real world community. It worked really well.''
</P>
<P>
   Though album sales weren't the site's main reason to exist, he
sold ``White Ladder'' through the site, one of the very few places
where the record was available to State-side fans.
</P>
<P>
   And once stations such as Los Angeles' KCRW-FM and
Philadelphia's WXPN-FM began playing some of its most striking
songs, sales took off, so substantially that he began selling
through Amazon.com as well.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, he became the first act signed by the new label
co-founded by American musician Dave Matthews, a fan of his music.
And perhaps the best song on his album, ``Please Forgive Me,'' was
featured on a recent episode of the Fox TV show ``Time of Your
Life.''
</P>
<P>
   The Web sales helped make it all possible, though Gray said he
wouldn't have relied on the proceeds for his living.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was more like a litmus test,'' Gray said. ``You get the
feeling there's something out there. There's no huge money to be
made. I don't think there are that many records being sold. But it
was so exciting to see there was an appetite out there for my
music. Critical acclaim is one thing, but when people go mad for
something and start raving about it, that's a brilliant thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles songwriter Phil Roy, who recently opened for Gray in
a Philadelphia concert, can claim something of the same story. He
spent 18 years writing songs for everyone from Jennifer Love Hewitt
to L.A. Guns to Ray Charles, before releasing ``grouchyfriendly''
in January.
</P>
<P>
   He set up a graphically distinctive Web site at www.philroy.com
where fans could buy the album, talk with each other and get tour
information.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can buy it through Amazon.com or go to my site,'' Roy
said. ``And they send me all these lovely messages with each of
these $15 checks. The only ones that are unresponsive are the
record companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Again, sympathetic DJs on KCRW and WXPN helped push his music,
which has made a difference for his success.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have a break,'' Roy admits, but adds, ``The Net
leveled the playing field. I could never do this even two years
ago. Now the door's open.'' &QL;

VIEWERS DESERVE BETTER THAN THIS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below; `tonight' in story refers to Mon., June 26.) 
Our rating: 2 stars 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
 
``Resurrection Blvd.,'' debuting tonight on Showtime, is the only
English-language TV series in America _ and let's guess that, with
the networks and cable, there presently are roughly 200 ongoing
fiction shows _ that prominently features Latino actors and/or
examines Latino themes. While you're pondering that staggering
inequity, take a moment likewise to lament that it's too bad this
one's not any better.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Riddled with cliche and melodrama, ``Resurrection Blvd.''
follows the saga of the Santiago family of East L.A. Patriarch
Roberto (Tony Plana), a former boxer whose brother was seriously
injured while boxing, drives his son Carlos (Michael DeLorenzo) to
become a champion. Roberto's oldest son Miguel (Mauricio Mendoza)
helps his pop with Carlos. Youngest son Alex (Nicholas Gonzalez)
attends med school and has an eye for a cute blonde there. Daughter
Yolanda (Ruth Livier) not only works long hours at a Beverly Hills
law firm but also, understandably resentfully, helps take care of
the family, while Victoria (Marisol Nichols) is a high school
student not particularly adept at picking friends. Bibi (Elizabeth
Pena), the tempestuous sister of Roberto's recently deceased wife,
conveniently lives next door (shades of ``Everybody Loves
Raymond'') and visits Roberto's home frequently to provide a lot of
expository clarification.
</P>
<P>
   It's Victoria who sets the drama into motion here, by getting
flirtatious with Jaime (Jose Solano, Jr.), a local thug. She cuts
school to attend a party where she finds him with another woman,
and even though all she's done is express mild interest in him,
she's furious; before long, she's nursing a shiner courtesy of said
bad guy (this guy's just plain evil). Well, of course Carlos has to
settle the score just a couple of days before the big fight that
will decide whether he has a shot at a serious career in boxing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Resurrection Blvd.'' prides itself on placing Latinos not only
before but behind the camera; one wishes the producers had put some
in the writing room who had a cogent understanding of character and
plot development. For example, Carlos' longtime girlfriend simply
disappears after he's shot; when she briefly shows up again, she
simply explains she had ``stuff'' she had to do. When Alex's blond
med student asks why he dropped out, he too simply chalks it up to
``stuff.'' His inability to communicate doesn't prevent them from
arranging a date, shot in montage so there's no need to write
anything depicting their chemistry or lack of it; simply cut to the
end of the evening where she says she had a nice time and they
smooch.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the cast deserves better material. Plana, an
undervalued veteran actor, finds a resonant emotional core in
scenes where the writers neglected to place any. Pena could do more
than what she's given to do here, as well. DeLorenzo exudes an
appealing soulfulness, while Gonzalez could emerge as the breakout
star here, and not just because he's the only actor who doesn't
have an accent. Livier does laudable work in a thankless,
underwritten role, and Nichols exudes such freshly scrubbed appeal,
it's tough to think of her as someone who'd have trouble finding
appropriate friends. Cheech Marin and Paul Rodriguez turn up in
small roles in tonight's 90-minute pilot.
</P>
<P>
   Another quibble: ``Resurrection Blvd.'' is yet another one of
those shows in which the Latino characters speak in Spanish only
when it's a word the gringos know (``Que?'' ``Vamanos!''
``Comprendo todo'') or can figure out from the context.
</P>
<P>
   Why not just give the audience credit _ if it's a scene in which
the characters might reasonably converse solely in Spanish, let
them; a subtitle here and there isn't going to kill anyone and it
might seem more realistic to the series' target audience. Which
deserves better _ and, definitely, more _ than ``Resurrection
Blvd.'' &QL; 
_____ &QL; 
The show: ``Resurrection Blvd.'' &QL; 
What: Drama focusing on the lives of an East L.A. Latino family. &QL; 
The stars: Michael DeLorenzo, Elizabeth Pena, Tony Plana, Nicholas
Gonzalez, Ruth Livier, Mauricio Mendoza, Marisol Nichols, Daniel
Zacapa. &QL; 
Where: Showtime. &QL; 
When: 10 p.m. Mondays. &QL;

   ---What: (registered trademark sign with the r in a circle) (tm
superscript sign for trademark)ARK: Master culture jammers mimic
the structures of American capitalism to funnel money from donors
to media satirists who pull a variety of high-profile pranks. They
more modestly call it ``corporate consulting for the 21st
Century.'' &QL; 
---Where: www.rtmark.com (pronounce it ``artmark'') &QL; 
What's cool: This site with a name even more impenetrable than
Prince, the Artist Formerly Known as a Typographic Error, is the
pivot point and paymaster for post-modern pranksters who've done
such things as create Web sites mimicking George W. Bush and the
World Trade Organization; swapping voice boxes in Barbie and G.I.
Joe dolls; and a series of compact discs that stretch our
increasingly litigation-cramped notions of what constitutes free
speech, criticism and the ``fair use'' doctrine. &QL; 
---Features: Want to help finance someone's great cultural
revolution? Or at least minor cultural skirmish? They've got their
own ``mutual fund model'' to cobble together funds from a variety
of sources. They finance projects that ``meet our bottom-line
criterion: `attack without physical injury' ... to humans, that
is.'' Coming up is their third annual Corporate Poetry Contest. And
of course, you can link to past tricks and see what they've
wrought. &QL; 
---You'll like this if: You think globalized corporate culture may
not be an untouchable good. Or you just like a good political
practical joke. &QL;

REMEMBER PEARL HARBOR? 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Three interesting things happened last week in the Microsoft
case. Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson gave the government permission
to ask the Supreme Court to take up the matter in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   He delayed his various conduct orders to the company for a year,
instead of three months, giving the high court plenty of time to
act, preserving an aura of fairness.
</P>
<P>
   And in Redmond, Wash., Microsoft rolled out the next stage of
its Internet strategy, an ambitious and many-pronged project which
it dubbed Microsoft.NET. The idea is to slowly turn its traditional
shrink-wrapped software business into an Internet-based
subscription computing service.
</P>
<P>
   The blueprint is for a system so extensive that, curiously
enough, were it successful over the course of the next decade it
could take over the operation of the entire World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Not a bad time, therefore, to remember the day the company
rolled out its (itals)first(unitals) Internet offensive _ and got
itself in so much trouble.
</P>
<P>
   That was December 7, 1995. Microsoft called 200 reporters and
analysts to Redmond to announce that it was going to stop running
away from the Web and, instead, tackle it. ``You will see this
company transformed,'' said president Steve Ballmer. ``This is our
jihad!'' (For a lively account, see ``How The Web Was Won'' by
Seattle Times reporter Paul Andrews.)
</P>
<P>
   Strange as it sounds, Microsoft in those days was on the ropes.
Depite the hoopla surrounding the rollout of its Windows 95
operating system _ remember the $200 million ad campaign, featuring
the Rolling Stones ``Start Me Up''? _ the perception was growing
that it had somehow missed the boat.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle's Larry Ellison in September had proclaimed that the
personal compter was a passing fad. Network computers soon would
replace it, he predicted, inexpensive devices capable of plugging
in to the Internet (or a corporate intranet) and drawing on
whatever programs were desired _ for a fee. Bill Gates'
newly-published book, ``The Road Ahead,'' was a laughingstock among
the cognoscenti; it barely mentioned the Web. In November, analyst
Rick Sherlund of Goldman Sachs removed Microsoft from his
recommended list.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, start-up Netscape Communications Corp. stock was
soaring. Its initial public offering in August had been priced at
$28, but its shares soared to nearly $75 the first day, before
closing at $59. Magazines trumpeted inventor Marc Andreesen as the
next Bill Gates. Pundits declared that technnology once again was
about to accomplish the creative destruction of a monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   And indeed, Netscape's browser did threaten Microsoft's
monopoly. Like's Sun's Java computer language, it was a crucial
piece of middleware, a program that worked across many operating
systems and so had the potential to promote real competition.
</P>
<P>
   So Microsoft called in the press to announce the deep changes
that it quietly had been preparing. Internet Day, they called it.
Gates began his remarks with a thorough analysis of the Japanese
bombing that had brought the United States into World War II. The
shrewdest reading of it came from the Japanese admiral who led it.
Isoroku Yamamoto wrote in his diary, ``I fear we have awakened a
sleeping giant.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it was Microsoft that was launching the surprise attack
that December day. Gates was displaying his usual tin ear for
symbolism. (``Perhaps someone forgot that the (itals)bad(unitals)
guys had attacked then, in most American minds,'' wrote Robert H.
Reid in his account of the meeting in ``Architects of the Web.'')
In Gates' eyes, however, Microsoft had been the Navy slumbering at
Pearl.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft chieftain then introduced his own Web browser, the
Internet Explorer, which was tied inextricably to its Windows
operating system, which commanded more than 90 percent of the
market. A team of 2,300 programmers had worked day and night for
six months to make it ready.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy worked, brilliantly. Netscape shares fell nearly
$29 the next day, and in the next few years, the company was
virually rolled up, at least as a direct threat to Microsoft. AOL
purchased it in November 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble was, the US Justice Department was watching.
Previously it had accepted Microsoft's promise not to muscle its
competitors _ Novell, Lotus, Borland, Sun _ again. This time the
company's conduct of the browser war with Netscape became the focus
of the government case. An avalanche of e-mail, meeting notes, and
memoranda introduced into evidence during the trial persuaded Judge
Jackson the company was guilty of antitrust violations in many
instances. Netscape was just the most flagrant.
</P>
<P>
   First Microsoft tried to persuade Netscape to simply carve up
the browser market, he found, with Microsoft intending to take the
lion's share. When Netscape refused to abandon its efforts to
compete, Microsoft set to work put them out of business, by fair
means and foul.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Jackson ordered that the company be broken in two,
in such a way that the PC company would have to compete for new
business among the middleware companies and with the Internet half
of Microsoft. The company has appealed his rulings.
</P>
<P>
   At its product announcement last week in Redmond, the company
once again had bent to the task it set five years ago _ trying to
extend its dominion to the Web, this time more gingerly, more
subtly than before. The government and even the judge have accused
it of being up to its usual tricks.
</P>
<P>
   They fear Microsoft is again illegally attempting to leverage
its monopoly of personal computers in order to extend its control
to servers (the large computers that are the workhorses of the
Internet) and to various small Internet appliances (such as Palm
Pilots) whose popularity is growing rapidly. The trick, of course,
is to control the degree of ease and completeness with which
rivals' devices may be interconnected.
</P>
<P>
   The company clearly has learned something from its travails. The
new computing platform is designed to work with non-Windows
platforms, at least up to a point. But executives admitted last
week that key features were designed to work (itals)better(unitals)
with other Microsoft gear _ raising the possibility that the
extraordinary bundle of software services contemplated by
Microsoft.NET could someday take over the entire Internet, on
exactly the same logic that Windows rode to desktop hegemony.
</P>
<P>
   The moral of the story of Pearl Harbor Day in Redmond in 1995 is
that the lock on the personal computer desktop that Microsoft
possesses is far more powerful than it looks _ especially when
wielded with a determination to have it all. Technology is a
powerful solvent, it is true. But for situations like this, we need
the Justice Department.

<P>
   MIYAKONOJO, Japan _ For a powerful politician seeking
re-election to parliament for the fifth time, Kazumi Mochinaga is a
man of few words.
</P>
<P>
   With his campaign in full swing for the national election on
Sunday, Mochinaga declines to give interviews, makes few public
appearances and hardly ever gives political speeches in his
conservative rice-growing district near the southern tip of the
island of Kyushu.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, using a time-honored formula of his long-governing
Liberal Democratic Party, Mochinaga, 76, a former Welfare Ministry
official, long ago locked up the support of just about every major
business and professional association in the region and is
perfectly happy to let them campaign on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   His campaign headquarters, occupying a sprawling parking lot
here, seems intended to create a crushing sense of the inevitable,
filled as it is with the banners of the many influential
townspeople who have endorsed him and poster-sized testimonials
from party bigwigs in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps his glossy campaign poster best crystallizes the message
to the voters, with its images of a bullet train, immaculate
highways and a huge amusement center that will be host to some of
the events of this summer's meeting of the world's leading
industrial nations. With all of Kyushu's Liberal Democratic Party
legislators arrayed around Mochinaga, the poster succeeds in
announcing ``look what all of our years of government have brought
you,'' without using any words.
</P>
<P>
   But this kind of campaign, along with the kind of politics that
have produced it, are under attack across Japan as never before by
opposition candidates who argue that an era of mammoth politically
driven public works spending has come close to ruining Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Many voters have also begun to say that however nice the
old-guard politicians' promises may sound, Japan, with its
seemingly intractable crisis of debt and stagnation, must finally
learn to say no.
</P>
<P>
   Although most opinion polls suggest another victory by the
Liberal Democrats, the conservatives who have run Japan for all but
two years since 1955, skepticism toward the government and its
policies has rarely been so great.
</P>
<P>
   The Cabinet of Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori has a popularity
rating scarcely reaching the double digits, and many political
analysts here say that the party's hold on the people is crumbling.
</P>
<P>
   A glimpse of the future is already on display in quiet,
mountain-ringed towns like this one, where an insurgent campaign by
a young independent candidate is giving Mochinaga the run of his
life.
</P>
<P>
   The candidate, Yoshihisa Furukawa, is no policy radical. What
the eager 34-year-old does promise, however, is a shakeup of the
shadowy collusion between business and government that has been the
Liberal Democratic Party's hallmark. Counting on his own seemingly
boundless energy, he offers a new relationship between voters and
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   While Mochinaga seems almost to sleepwalk through his campaign,
Furukawa, limited only by the hoarseness creeping into his voice,
wants to meet every voter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gets close enough to the electorate to feel their spittle
on his face,'' one aide said.
</P>
<P>
   As Furukawa's campaign van goes from neighborhood to
neighborhood, campaign workers intone an almost hypnotic message
through the loudspeakers emphasizing his young age, his Internet
address (www.393939.com) and a determination to ``fight to the end
to resurrect Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   As they shout, Furukawa often leans clear across the vehicle,
nearly climbing out of the driver's window to thank the women who
come out of their houses to greet him, and constantly waves his
sunburned left arm to the farmers who look up from rice fields
momentarily, smile and bow.
</P>
<P>
   This energetic approach earned the challenger, then unknown, a
respectable score when he took on Mochinaga in the last election,
four years ago. Now the incumbent, by his own aides' admission, is
running scared.
</P>
<P>
   `` Mr. Furukawa is running as an independent, and that is a
minus,'' said Kenichi Sugimura, an official in the Mochinaga
campaign who bemoaned the passage of a simpler era when the
instructions of an employer or a husband sufficed to make a whole
family vote a certain way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our opponent has been campaigning ever since the last
election, and such a grass-roots effort is a bit frightening,''
Sugimura said. ``It is impossible to know how much support he
has.''
</P>
<P>
   But as frightening as Furukawa's method is for the incumbent, it
is the message of candidacies like these, with their promise to
break the bonds between business and government, that most
threatens the Liberal Democratic Party
</P>
<P>
   ``Mochinaga and so many other Diet members are like tribesmen,
each representing their own favorite interest groups,'' said
Furukawa, who works as an adviser to his parents' liquor business.
``They think their job is to suck money out of the government and
spend it here. I believe we have to examine our fiscal problems
honestly, and level with the people for once.''
</P>
<P>
   The straight talk is clearly working with a lot of voters here,
especially, it seems, younger voters and women.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, Mochinaga was always very confident, but this
race is too close to call,'' said Watanabe Makiko, 47, a homemaker.
``There are many things I'd like to see changed in this country,
and Furukawa's campaign gives people hope.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But if the opposition campaign has inspired hope in some
quarters of the electorate, the incumbent retains some powerful
assets.
</P>
<P>
   Foremost among them, perhaps, is apathy. Asked about the nearly
50 percent of the electorate that has expressed no preference in
opinion polls, Mori, whose brief tenure in office has been marked
by provocative comments, said he hoped they would ``just sleep'' on
Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   Even more powerful in small towns like this, however, is simple
fear.
</P>
<P>
   At a campaign event for Mochinaga, public child- and
nursing-care employees were virtually ordered by their superiors to
turn out for the incumbent, whose four-minute speech was one of the
longest of his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Construction companies and other businesses have been made to
understand that if they do not support Mochinaga, contracts will
dry up and bidding opportunities will disappear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up until three months ago, business people used to invite
Furukawa to their parties and weddings, but suddenly that all
stopped,'' said Shinobu Fujita, a construction company executive
who supports Furukawa. ``But then the word was passed around that
if you were his supporter, you would be made to feel the pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very hard to mobilize people under those circumstances.
In Japan, we call that giving people something to think about.''

BUSH CHANGES SUBJECT FROM EXECUTION TO ENERGY PRICES 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUSCALOOSA, Ala. _ On the morning after a highly publicized,
bitterly controversial execution in Texas, Gov. George W. Bush
quickly tried to change the subject Friday, challenging Vice
President Al Gore's record and positions on several fronts, from
Social Security to the longstanding investigations into the
fund-raising practices of Democrats in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush was most eager Friday to cast Gore as someone who was
partly responsible for _ and a proponent of _ high gasoline prices.
</P>
<P>
   Carrying with him a copy of Gore's 1992 book on the environment,
``Earth in the Balance,'' Bush twice read aloud a passage
describing ``higher taxes on fossil fuels'' as ``one of the logical
first steps in changing our policies in a manner consistent with a
more responsible approach to the environment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Want to talk about energy?'' Bush said Friday morning to the
reporters on his campaign plane, who had spent the last several
days grilling him about capital punishment. Then, opening the book,
he said, ``Page 173.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush was on his way to Alabama from Texas, and his attention to
the book suggested that he wanted to move on from the subject that
had dominated news coverage of his campaign, the execution Thursday
night of a convicted killer named Gary Graham.
</P>
<P>
   Though many legal experts said Graham had received a deeply
flawed trial, and five of 17 members of a state parole board voted
Thursday afternoon to commute Graham's sentence to life in prison,
he was put to death by lethal injection at the state prison in
Huntsville at 8:49 p.m. Central Daylight Time. A half-hour before
that, Bush read a statement to reporters expressing confidence that
``justice is being done.''
</P>
<P>
   Over 19 years, dozens of courts and dozens of judges had heard
and rejected appeals by Graham's lawyers. But Graham steadfastly
proclaimed his innocence of the 1981 murder for which he was given
a death sentence and, in a statement just before his execution,
said, ``The truth will come out.'' It took a full minute for prison
officials to strap a struggling Graham to the gurney.
</P>
<P>
   In response to questions from reporters on his campaign plane,
Bush said he was aware of the details of Graham's final minutes.
When the governor was asked if he understood how other people,
looking at the facts in Graham's case, could come to a different
conclusion from him, Bush said: ``Yes, I do. Good people can
disagree.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to all the prominent people, like the actor Danny
Glover and the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who rallied to Graham's cause,
Bush said: ``I don't resent it in the least. I think it's part of
the American process.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's assertion Friday that Gore supported higher gas prices
came as he and Gore jockeyed for position on a campaign issue that
is suddenly looming large.
</P>
<P>
   And it deflected attention from reports of the enormous sums of
campaign money that Bush has received over the years from the gas
and oil industry. Gore has suggested that Bush's coziness with the
energy industry would make him reluctant to intervene on behalf of
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There seems to be an effort out of Washington to blame me for
rising energy prices,'' Bush said at a news conference around
midday. ``The American people aren't going to buy that. The
Clinton-Gore administration has been there for seven years and
we're more dependent now than ever before on foreign oil sources.
And I'm amazed that they're trying to shift the blame.''
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Hattaway, a spokesman for the Gore campaign, said the
Clinton administration had consistently explored ways to reduce
dependency on foreign oil. He also questioned Bush's ties to the
oil industry, noting that Bush wants to give companies access to
oil reserves in pristine patches of Alaskan wilderness that Gore
wants to protect.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   And Hattaway said that what Gore was proposing in ``Earth in the
Balance'' was not higher prices at the gasoline pump but steeper
taxes on companies that harvested and produced the kinds of fuels
that were most damaging to the environment. Hattaway said that
Gore's plan included details that would protect consumers from
higher gasoline prices, but he was unable to explain how.
</P>
<P>
   He said that Bush was clearly feeling ``the heat over gas prices
and his failure to take on his friends in the oil and gas
industry.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Very warm and humid conditions will cover most areas from the
central and southern Plains to the Atlantic Seaboard this weekend.
A series of disturbances near the northern edge of the sultry air
mass will produce clusters of heavy showers and thunderstorms from
the northern Rockies to the Great Lakes states.
</P>
<P>
   Humidity will increase in the Northeast Saturday as breezes from
the southwest develop. Sunshine will be ample, however, and clouds
will begin to increase later Saturday, especially west of the
Appalachians. Farther west, broken bands of strong thunderstorms
will erupt during the heat of the afternoon from the southern Great
Lakes states to the central Mississippi Valley.
</P>
<P>
   High pressure will suppress clouds over most of the Southeast,
although a few thunderstorms will form near the coast. Meanwhile,
moist air lingering from the southern Sierra to the central Rockies
will promote afternoon thunderstorms over many peaks.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: RECURRENT RAIN
</P>
<P>
   The first six months of 2000 have been the wettest on record in
Binghamton, N.Y. Since Jan. 1, 27.26 inches of rain have been
measured, eclipsing the previous record of 26.63 inches in 1998.
Normal rainfall from January through June in Binghamton is about 18
inches. In 1998, the wet first half of the year was followed by the
driest second half on record, when only 12.62 inches of rain fell.
This year there is no sign of much drier weather returning to the
Northeast.

POLE BEANS: TALL, TASTY AND WORTH THE WAIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, June 25) 
 By ANNE RAVER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   I should have gotten my pole beans in by early May, but the
weather didn't cooperate. Every time I got down to the farm, it
rained buckets, and the ground was like cement. The fine, sunny
weekends came when I was off seeing someone else's garden. So it
was mid-June before I got my seeds in the ground. Which is plenty
of time for a bush bean like Royal Burgundy, which takes only 60
days, but pole beans, which grow on vines that like to wind up
strings or trellises, often take more like 70 or 80 days to mature.
And since they keep coming, as long as you pick them, all summer
long, it's a shame to lose a month to the vagaries of weather and
the gardener.
</P>
<P>
   But one lovely event, and that's what it feels like, is my soil,
which is full of earthworms and a lot more workable thanks to a
cover crop of hairy vetch I planted in early September. I scattered
the seed over the old vegetable patch and it grew for two months
before winter set in, then picked up and was about a foot tall by
early May when we cut it down and turned it into the soil.
</P>
<P>
   Hairy vetch is a legume. Like the beans I planted, it can take
nitrogen from the air and, with the help of nitrogen-fixing
bacteria that colonize its roots, turn that gas into a form of
nitrogen usable to the plant. It also releases nitrogen into the
soil through its roots, which is why just growing beans or peas can
fertilize your ground.
</P>
<P>
   In the third century B.C., Theophrastus wrote that the Greeks
planted broad beans to improve the soil. So I'm in good company.
</P>
<P>
   If you aren't familiar with beanology, snap beans are so crunchy
they snap, and are eaten pod and all; haricots verts, or fillet
beans, are bred to be slender and should be picked pencil-thin;
Italian Romano varieties are long, flat-podded types, which can be
eaten pod and all, shelled as fresh beans or left on the vines to
dry.
</P>
<P>
   I'm concentrating on pole beans this summer because they look so
pretty on trellises, where you can see their various-colored
blossoms, and they have a real beany taste, which makes bush beans
pale by comparison. Bush beans also give up the ghost after a few
pickings, after which you have to pull them up and start another
crop in another part of the garden. I'm getting too lazy to do
anything I can avoid _ so pole beans seem the far better choice.
</P>
<P>
   You can eat pole beans fresh, or let them dry on the vine and
shell them for use all winter. They look beautiful in big glass
jars, and it makes me feel good to think I can eat yummy beans
grown without pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen and Shepherd Ogden, the founders of Cook's Garden in
Londonderry, Vt., think pole beans are so delicious they don't even
bother with bush beans anymore. And I've planted a few of their
favorites.
</P>
<P>
   Trionfo Violetto is an Italian heirloom with dark green,
purple-veined leaves and lavender flowers. The deep purple,
flavorful bean will keep its color, Ogden says, if you boil it less
than two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Kwintus is a long, flat-podded bean in the Romano type. ``It
bears as soon as a bush bean, but it keeps going all summer,''
Ogden said. ``And no matter how big they get, the beans are still
good.''
</P>
<P>
   Borlotto is a brown speckled bean that grows in multicolored
pods 8 to 12 inches long. It's as close as Ogden could get to a
bean called Lamon, which is sold in the Venetian marketplace and is
used in pasta e fagioli, the classic pasta and bean dish that goes
right to the hips. ``It's a meaty bean with a flavor reminiscent of
a chestnut,'' Ogden said.
</P>
<P>
   I've also planted Musica, an 8-inch Romano type hailed for its
sweet, delicious flavor. (Territorial Seeds, in Cottage Grove, Ore.
_ 541-942-9547 _ calls it the ``finest Romano pole bean we've ever
trialed.'') And two runner beans: Painted Lady, which has red and
white blossoms attractive to hummingbirds, and bears beautifully
mottled purple and white beans; and Scarlet Runner, which has red
blossoms and beans mottled with shades of violet, red and black.
First described in 1750, it's one of the oldest runner beans in
existence, according to the Seed Savers Exchange, in Decorah, Iowa.
You can eat the pods and the fresh beans, and cook the dried ones
with a chunk of smoked ham all afternoon on a winter's day.
</P>
<P>
   The Seed Savers Exchange has a vast collection of seeds, thanks
in part to the late John Withee, who lived in Lynnfield, Mass., and
was known as ``the Bean Man.'' He gave the exchange his collection
of 1,186 strains of beans in 1981. If you join the exchange, you
will receive a yearly handbook on the current year's seed offerings
(information, 319-382-5990), and you can also trade your own
heirloom seeds with other members.
</P>
<P>
   I'm experimenting with trellises, too. Some are bamboo tepees
set six feet apart, with a single bamboo pole lashed across the
top. I've hung some with netting (with the large square holes), and
some with sturdy hemp twine, strung horizontally and vertically.
Gardener's Supply Co. (800-863-1700), in Burlington, Vt., has a
good selection of such materials. I've made other trellises out of
sturdy posts, 10 feet long, sunk a foot into the ground, and
stretched twine across the top. When the bean plants appear, I'll
give each one a vertical string to wind up. We'll see which
trellises fare better in the first windy storm.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, my dog, Red, has done battle with the ground hogs. If
you don't have a dog, get a fence, because rabbits and groundhogs
love beans as much as people do.

SUPPORT IN HOUSE GROWS FOR EASING CUBA EMBARGO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After four decades of an economic embargo against
Cuba, a proposal to allow food and medicine sales to the communist
nation is experiencing a groundswell of support in the US House,
where it may be approved as early as next week.
</P>
<P>
   But advocates of the measure, who for years have argued the Cuba
ban is outdated and futile, admit that some of the credit for the
growing number of endorsements belongs to someone else.
</P>
<P>
   Elian Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Before the plight of the 6-year-old refugee focused national
attention on the communist island, they say, most constituents gave
little thought to whether the US policy made sense. Nor, they say,
was there much interest in bucking the powerful Cuban-American
community, which until recently operated largely outside the public
spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   And while a number of other factors have helped renew the Cuba
debate in Congress _ including a vote to expand trade relations
with another communist nation, China, and a new study showing that
American farmers could earn millions of dollars in sales to Cuba _
almost no one can explain the growing interest in Cuban trade
policy without eventually mentioning the little boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been worrying about this for six or seven years, but we
never thought it would come this quickly,'' said Representative J.
Joseph Moakley, Democrat of Massachusetts, a longtime supporter of
increased ties with Cuba. ``It's the Elian thing. Elian has done
his people some good.''
</P>
<P>
   The pending agreement, which would allow US companies to sell
food and medicine to Cuba but bar Cuban companies from exporting
goods to the United States, still faces stiff opposition from
Cuban-American leaders in Congress. But a similar measure has
passed in the Senate before, and would probably do so again this
year. Even though the Senate this week rejected a bill to study
changing overall US-Cuba policy, the Senate is generally more
favorable toward free trade than the House.
</P>
<P>
   More significantly, House Republican leaders have in recent
weeks indicated they no longer oppose relaxing sanctions outright.
Instead, they have agreed to try to work out a compromise that
would satisfy both sides.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations are delicate: Many Republicans do not want
Cuban leader Fidel Castro, or businesses within his reach, to have
any dealings with US banks. They are, therefore, demanding the
legislation specify that Cuba pay for all food and medicine
purchases with cash. Advocates of the bill say that requiring
cash-only deals would be almost the same as keeping the sanctions
in place.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, some opponents are outraged that the
legislation would also ease food and medicine sales to several
other countries, including Libya and Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Still, House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, an Illinois Republican,
last week said an agreement was ``about there.'' And Representative
Robert Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat long opposed to lifting Cuba
sanctions, said the most remarkable development is that there have
been any negotiations at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe we're giving (them) a major break, a major
concession, because we don't believe in sales to Cuba, period,''
said Menendez, one of several House members insisting on the
agreement mandating cash-only deals.
</P>
<P>
   Justifying the Cuba embargo has become increasingly difficult
for many in the House, especially those who voted last month to
normalize trade relations with China. During that debate, many
pro-business Republicans argued that engaging China economically
would encourage democratic change. That caused many legislators to
wonder: Wouldn't the same theory apply to Cuba?
</P>
<P>
   ``The China debate has led to a natural questioning of whether
our Cuba policy is appropriate,'' said Representative James P.
McGovern, a Massachusetts Democrat. ``On all fronts, there is much
more activity on Cuba than there has been at any time I can
remember.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the US agriculture industry has begun a
massive push to open trade relations with Cuba, arguing its
proximity and its fundamental need for food could be a gold mine
for American farmers.
</P>
<P>
   According to a study commissioned by the World Policy Institute,
a New York-based think tank, the partial relaxation of sanctions
being considered in the House could lead to $444 million a year in
food and medicine sales, as well as 6,000 related US jobs. If the
embargo were lifted entirely, the effects could mean $1.6 billion a
year in US sales, plus approximately 20,000 associated US jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even the economic analyst who conducted the study, Paula
Stern, former chairwoman of the US International Trade Commission,
said the chief reason for the sudden fascination with Cuba is
largely due to one boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've all been interested in seeing how quickly public opinion
has moved with regards to Cuba,'' Stern said. ``Everyone is an
expert now on Cuba because of Elian. I believe the reason why the
legislation is moving has to do with the fact that the general
public is looking at Cuba.'' In the past, she said, Cuba was
watched by ``just a small and energized group who oppose trade.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some believe that group of powerful Cuban-Americans,
now represented to the world by the Miami relatives of Elian
Gonzalez, may be partly responsible for any momentum the embargo
bill has gained.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Fernandez, the press officer for the Cuban Interest Section
in Washington that represents that country, said the Miami
relatives _ who cloistered Elian in their home and were often
depicted by federal law enforcement officials as unreasonable _
drew attention to views that are out of step with the rest of the
country. ``The American people have had the chance to know exactly
what kind of people these right-wing Cuban-Americans are,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Menendez called that ``wishful thinking.'' And he said there was
still time for the embargo bill to backfire, inspiring the
Cuban-American community to redouble its attempts to defeat it.
``Whatever negativity might be perceived as a result of the Elian
issue will fuel their efforts,'' he said.

LACMA exhibit shows contemporary ceramics as colorful expressions 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
By REED JOHNSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometimes a vase isn't just a vase, or a teapot just a teapot.
</P>
<P>
   In the protean world of contemporary ceramics, these vessels
might be devotional objects, ingenious architectural experiments,
or pointed social commentaries wrapped inside complicated visual
puns. Perhaps all three.
</P>
<P>
   Whether miniature or monumental, classical or aggressively
post-millennial, ceramics after World War II have been as much
about what they express as what they contain.
</P>
<P>
   That historic transition _ from ceramics as functional objects
to ceramics as the tangible embodiment of abstract ideas _ is the
subject of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art's just-opened
exhibition ``Color and Fire: Defining Moments in Studio Ceramics,
1950-2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Assembled from LACMA's large permanent collection of
contemporary ceramics, ``Color and Fire'' marks the first time the
museum has organized this type of comprehensive survey.
</P>
<P>
   In her catalog essay, Jo Lauria, LACMA assistant curator of
decorative arts, dates the birth of the modern ceramics movement to
around 1925. That year marked the end of the Arts and Crafts era,
during which most pottery was created by ``teams of skilled
artisans'' who divided themselves into specialized tasks of
``shaping, decorating, glazing, and firing.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, today's studio ceramicist is a kind of auteur,
responsible for every step of object-making, from planning to
production. Partly liberated from the market necessities of
mass-production, ceramicists began to play with possibilities.
Ultimately rejecting the Bauhaus adage that form must follow
function, they looked at new ways of how a container encapsulates
space, ropes it off, makes it its own.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout centuries of Western art, lowly clay hadn't been
taken seriously as a sculptural medium, compared with prestige
materials like marble and bronze. But as technological
breakthroughs in the form of new glazes and tougher substances
proliferated, so did the variety of ceramics and what they had to
say.
</P>
<P>
   Southern California is a worthy venue for this exhibition, home
to such renowned practitioners of the art as Peter Voulkos and the
late Beatrice Wood of Ojai, the ``mama of Dadaism.''
</P>
<P>
   With 200 ceramic objects offering up their glimmering surfaces,
``Color and Fire'' gives us much to reflect on. &QL;

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Robert D. Haas, the beleaguered chairman of Levi
Strauss &AMP; Co., has a dilemma on his hands that few people outside
the company fully appreciate: endangered family values.
</P>
<P>
   Haas is the scion of a proud San Francisco clan that has for
five generations owned and managed the blue jeans maker with an
unconventional devotion to principles as well as profits. But now,
with sales falling and profits scarce, a new pragmatism has taken
hold.
</P>
<P>
   A new chief executive has been recruited from outside the
family. In the last three years half the headquarters staff has
been replaced or left. A plan to pay hundreds of millions of
dollars in bonuses to employees has been canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, financial results disclosed last week suggest that the
company has only slowed its decline. Sales continued to deteriorate
in 1999, and the company _ after a huge restructuring charge _ was
barely profitable.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1996, Haas made a risky decision to address family
disputes and succession problems through a leveraged buyout that
consolidated ownership within a group of relatives who shared his
values.
</P>
<P>
   To pull it off Levi took on $3.3 billion in debt. While
dissident family members and senior employees who sold their stock
were handsomely rewarded, the timing could not have been worse for
the company.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, Levi Strauss, the world's largest manufacturer of
branded apparel, saw its sales go into a free fall. The company
whose founder invented blue jeans in the 1850s, woke up to find its
market deteriorating. Haas, admitting that his company had fallen
prey to complacency and sloppy management, says it hardly noticed
that its iconic blue jeans were losing their appeal to the young.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing as blinding as success,'' Haas said in a
two-hour interview last week. ``It's easy to get inbred and forget
that businesses go through cycles. We took our eye off the ball. I
plead guilty as the CEO in charge.''
</P>
<P>
   The Haas family's paternalistic management was the first
principle to be compromised. Long after his competitors had rushed
to use cheaper contract labor in developing countries, Haas
resisted the dry efficiencies of globalization. Now, after 29 plant
closures and the layoffs of some 18,500 people _ nearly half the
work force _ the company has moved the bulk of its jeans production
into contractors' hands overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the debt, though reduced to $2.3 billion, continues
to pressure the company _ interest costs actually rose last year _
and crimp its ability to retool.
</P>
<P>
   Prices for Levi's bonds, some of them now publicly traded even
though all the company's stock is privately held, sank to as low as
50 cents on the dollar last year. They rose to the still-dismal
level of about 80 cents only after the company decided to more
fully open its books to investors in April, including making
quarterly announcements of its results.
</P>
<P>
   Levi Strauss is also still reeling from a chaotic management
shakeup that came to a head in January 1999, when the company's
president, Peter Jacobi _ a Levi veteran who had been in charge of
operations only a year _ retired under a cloud with no replacement
in sight. Things did not begin to settle down until September, when
the leading candidate to replace Jacobi demanded Haas' title of
chief executive _ and got it.
</P>
<P>
   Haas bashfully stepped aside and brought in the candidate,
Philip A. Marineau, a corporate turn-around specialist and
marketing strategist who ran Pepsi's North America division.
Marineau, 53, had distinguished himself by turning the sports drink
Gatorade into a mass consumer brand while an executive at Quaker
Oats. During his 18-month stint at Pepsi he succeeded in besting
archrival Coke's domestic market share for the first time in a
decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``This enterprise is too big and there's too much at stake to
leave it to genes alone,'' said Haas. ``What we need is
professional and competent leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the new leadership of a cola war veteran, Levi Strauss is
fighting for survival on several fronts. First, it must overcome
deep skepticism among bond investors and make a convincing case
that drastic triage has put it on the track toward recovery.
</P>
<P>
   More specifically, it has the urgent task of fixing persistent
delays in its distribution to stores, which have worsened the sales
decline. The big test comes in late summer, when Levi needs to get
orders on retailers' shelves in time for the new school year _ a
test the company has failed miserably in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Equally important is its need to revitalize its most important
asset, its legendary name. Without the aura of the Levi's brand _
which long stood for authenticity, hipness, quality, personal
freedom and even political consciousness _ the company might have
been just another purveyor of denim pants.
</P>
<P>
   The brand also benefits from the company's social values. Levi's
history is rich with anecdotes illustrating the Haas family's
belief that there is more at stake in business than profits, and
that this ethical orientation is ultimately good for business.
</P>
<P>
   The company kept idle workers on the payroll during the Great
Depression, then became a pioneer in integrating factories in the
South in the 1950s. Amid the rising furor over contractors'
exploitation of foreign workers in sweatshops, Levi set a standard
in 1992 with a global code of conduct for protecting worker rights.
Some monitoring groups, however, have criticized Levi for not
living up to its code. Levi has responded by allowing outsiders to
have a closer look at its contractors. Doing the right thing,
Levi's leaders reasoned, guards the brand from scandal.
</P>
<P>
   As the latest example, Haas cites the generous severance and
retraining benefits offered to employees of the factories Levi
closed over the past three years. Those gestures earned the company
grudging praise from its unions. With the exception of angry
protests in Europe, where five factories were closed, workers
greeted their termination with quiet resignation. Severance and
restructuring costs totaled $1.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want my tombstone to read: `He shipped a billion pairs
of jeans,''' said Haas, 58, who kept the flame of a small
denim-colored candle conspicuously burning on his office table
during his interview. ``I can sleep better at night knowing that
the package we put together for our displaced people provided them
with far more benefits than what is conventional.''
</P>
<P>
   If laying off American workers might seem at odds with the
family's values, Haas has proven himself willing to trim excess
capacity. Shortly after he became chief executive in 1984, he
closed 27 plants and dismissed 10,600 workers. ``You have to have a
financially viable business, or all the words about values can ring
hollow,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But if Haas remains the company philosopher, Marineau has
championed the cause of pragmatism. He says he shares Haas'
principles, but wants the company to operate more like a
conventional business. ``Levi's is unique in how strongly it states
its values and aspirations,'' he said. ``My goal is not to reinvent
the values, but to make them relevant to the market and the
experience we are in.''
</P>
<P>
   Employees credit Marineau with improving company discipline. He
started out by cleaning house.
</P>
<P>
   He inherited personnel problems that were perhaps symptomatic of
the organization's decay. There was suspected embezzlement: in one
publicly disclosed case, an administrative assistant in the
customer relations department was arrested after being accused of
stealing $224,000 by double-billing expenses and making personal
charges on a corporate credit card. There were recurrent complaints
of sexual harassment, including a lawsuit involving an executive in
the Dockers division.
</P>
<P>
   In Marineau's drive to improve company performance, about half
of the 1,800 employees at the Levi's Plaza corporate headquarters
in San Francisco have been replaced with new recruits over the past
year, said Dan Chew, vice president for communications.
</P>
<P>
   While Haas is measured and self-critical, Marineau is an
exuberant pitchman who argues that the second-quarter earnings
report is a positive one, showing as it does that annual sales
declines have slowed from double to single digits. He adds that
stability is just around the corner.
</P>
<P>
   Still, those latest results suggest that sales will end up well
below $5 billion this year, a steep decline from the $7.1 billion
peak in 1996. Last year, Levi's sales stood at $5.1 billion and its
net profit _ after a huge $500 million write-off as that year's
share of the restructuring costs _ had plummeted to $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The financial disclosures, at a company that has long resisted
public scrutiny, came in April, in filings to register $800 million
in company debt with the Securities and Exchange Commission and to
allow wider ownership and trading. But the disclosures also
represented Marineau's new policy of openness. Abandoning the
company's traditional insularity will help instill greater
discipline _ and enhance the value of the brand, he says,
emphasizing, ``We're sitting here trying to be as transparent as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   If Levi's new exposure helps raise investor confidence, it also
reveals just how far the company has fallen. In the 1996 leveraged
buyout, which ended the employee stock plan, the company promised
its workers bonuses of a full year's salary in 2002 if certain
financial goals were met. By last year, the company was so far from
reaching these goals that the bonus plan was canceled.
</P>
<P>
   The company also warns in its filings that its debt has retarded
its ability to compete with other companies that are less
leveraged. ``Debt does sharpen your focus,'' Haas acknowledges.
``But we feel that we have the financial breathing room to
accomplish what we need to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Marineau has no plans to build stores around the nation like
those run by its rival, Gap Inc. Levi has only a few stores,
continuing to sell mostly through other retailers. It began selling
jeans on its Web site in November 1998, but stopped this January
after running into logistical problems and disappointing sales.
 &UR;  &LR; Nor does Levi plan to grow through acquisitions, as has its other
major competitor, V.F. Corp., has done. Levi's share of the $12.2
billion domestic jeans market has dropped to about 14 percent, down
from 31 percent in 1990. &UR;  &LR;  Levi says it expects to have enough cash
to promote renewed growth. But instead of building factories or
stores, Levi plans to shore up its brands. With new products on the
way this fall, it is increasing its advertising budget, shifting
from cryptic mood advertising targeted at younger audiences to more
ads that focus on the products.
</P>
<P>
   The company has credited steady growth in sales of Dockers, its
casual clothing brand, with offsetting erosion in blue jeans sales.
But the growth of the Dockers line has leveled off, and Marineau
envisions only a small expansion in its 22 percent share of the
company's revenues, at least in the near future. The company plans
to extend its successful Slates brand of men's dress trousers to
pants, jackets, shirts and accessories like belts for both men and
women this fall.
</P>
<P>
   More important is the denim division, where Marineau plans to
place greater emphasis on setting fashion trends, especially in
women's clothing.
</P>
<P>
   To win back American youth, Marineau is counting on what the
company calls ``Engineered Jeans'' coming this fall, which he says
have already been a hit in Europe and Japan. Company executives
boast that the jeans' slanted back pockets and skewed seams have
ergonomic advantages and enough fashion appeal to bestow a halo on
the entire denim division. That division still accounts for 76
percent of Levi's sales.
</P>
<P>
   If debt analysts are gaining confidence in the company's
financial stability, apparel analysts are still unsure about Levi's
fashion sense and its new leader. Harry Bernard, an apparel
industry analyst at Colton Bernard in San Francisco, thinks Levi
Strauss should stop trying to be a fashion innovator and hone its
core business of selling competitively priced jeans. ``I believe
they'll be around for a long time to come as a major player,''
Bernard said. ``But they'll never again be a leader in fashion
trends for young consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   He expressed doubts about Marineau's grasp of the complexities
of the jeans business. ``He was tremendously successful in taking
Pepsi ahead of Coke, but all he was marketing was brown water in a
can,'' he said. ``He simply has to have the time available to
transfer his skill sets to the crazy fashion industry. It's totally
emotionally different.''
</P>
<P>
   Haas, however, remains confident that he has found in Marineau a
capable chief who also subscribes to the business principles that
distinguish Levi Strauss from its competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Since the company no longer has many of its own workers left to
benefit from its paternalism, the true test of its sincerity in
putting values on a par with profits comes in the overseas
factories where most of its products are now made. After a decade
of nimbly skirting controversy, Levi withdrew production earlier
this year from the Pacific island of Saipan, where allegations of
labor violations are persistent.
</P>
<P>
   Company executives say they must remain vigilant. On May 15 an
e-mail to employees from Haas, Marineau and Karen Duvall, a vice
president in charge of Levi's supply chain, warns overseas
executives that, even while the company is floundering, they must
not try to cut costs by skirting the code of conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have always said that the true test of management's
commitment to our values is how we will behave when times are
tough,'' the message said. ``Make no mistake: despite current
challenging business conditions, our guidelines are not
negotiable.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Levi's code of conduct has inspired the adoption of
similar policies by many other companies, it still isn't easy being
the first to put company values on the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you set your standards high, it becomes a huge risk,
because if you can't live up to them you risk being called a
hypocrite,'' Haas said. ``I'd rather have that then have the risk
of being part of just another conventional company.''

ECONOMIC LEADERS SEE NEED FOR REFORMS IN ASIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHATHAM, Mass. _ Three years after currency crises ripped from
one Asian economy to the next, world financial leaders meeting here
Friday concluded that it would be extremely difficult to enact
effective reforms to prevent a similar economic collapse from
occurring in the future.
</P>
<P>
   With Pleasant Bay sparkling in the background, the officials
debated the reforms undertaken in Asian financial and economic
systems _ reforms that some said may not go far enough.
</P>
<P>
   The international audience of economists, central bankers,
securities, regulators, and academics who gathered here explored
the causes of the financial crises in Latin America and Asia in the
1990s, as well as the solutions attempted.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Sheng, chairman of the Hong Kong Securities and Exchange
Commission, told an international audience of economists, central
bankers, securities regulators, and academics that in his 30-year
career as a financial official, he has witnessed three major crises
in Asian banking systems.
</P>
<P>
   Without significant reforms, he added, ``You can bet your bottom
dollar there will be another financial crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   After Thailand's currency, the baht, plunged in 1997 and other
Asian currencies followed, a chain reaction swept through the
once-booming region and then spread rapidly to Russia and Latin
America as each country lost liquidity and investors fled. The
overseas shakeup even rocked the US financial system. Intervention
by the US Federal Reserve System injected some liquidity into a
shaky world system, but the developing economies that were hit
continue to struggle with recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Officials all seemed to agree that some US-style standards of
disclosure and accounting _ to properly measure financial assets or
other economic data _ are needed. The political difficulties of
such reforms were acknowledged but were beyond the scope of those
attending. They also agreed that a better set of world economic
data is needed to help researchers.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Goldstein, managing director of the World Bank, said
that although Asian financial systems have undergone reform, the
``easier and quicker reforms'' have mostly been implemented.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Fischer, first deputy managing director of the
International Monetary Fund, a global lending agency that has been
under harsh attack for its handling of the financial meltdown, said
that disclosure by government institutions in the securities
markets can prevent bad decisions that precipitate crises.
</P>
<P>
   For example, once the baht began plunging investors learned that
Bank of Thailand had overextended itself by taking huge positions
in futures markets. The pending financial commitments would further
drain crumbling currency stockpiles and worsen the country's
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer said it was also instructive that countries with
flexible exchange rate systems in place, such as South Korea,
seemed to benefit in the midst of crisis by holding large foreign
currency reserves.
</P>
<P>
   Korea had about $35 billion in currency reserves in place, which
virtually disappeared within weeks as money flowed out of its
currency during the crisis. With restructuring well underway in
Korea, it has restored $80 billion in reserves and plans to add to
that, he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was no coincidence Korea experienced what was viewed as a
speedy recovery in a region where some countries are still
grappling with the aftermath of the crisis, Fischer said.
</P>
<P>
   A stockpile of currency reserves ``seems to matter,'' he said.
Fischer added that ``providing lines of credit by IMF and by
institutions could help countries very much.'' The IMF has set up
credit lines, he said, but technical difficulties to date have
prevented their use.
</P>
<P>
   Sheng, of Hong Kong's SEC, delivered the most blunt assessment
of a lesson of Asia's crisis that he believes was missed by many
experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Development economics over the past 50 years has been all
about (pursuing) growth, and we do not realize we cannot achieve
growth without huge risks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to manage national risks (within countries), because
national risks add up to global risks,'' he said. ``The strength of
the network is dependent on its weakest link.''

THE NEW YORK TIMES BOOK REVIEW PLANS CHILDREN'S BEST-SELLER LIST 
</HEADLINE>
   By DINITIA SMITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York Times Book Review will print a separate
best-seller list for children's books starting July 23.
</P>
<P>
   The change is largely in response to the expected demand for the
fourth in the Harry Potter series of children's books, editors at
the Book Review said.
</P>
<P>
   The new Harry Potter book, the title and plot of which are being
kept secret by the publisher, Levine/Scholastic, is scheduled for
release July 8. With an initial print run of 3.8 million in the
United States, it is widely expected to reach the top of the list.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time has come when we need to clear some room'' on the
list, said Charles McGrath, the editor of the Book Review, which
appears weekly in the paper's Sunday editions.
</P>
<P>
   Editors said that the idea of adding a children's list, in
addition to the three hardcover lists for fiction, nonfiction, and
``advice, how-to and miscellaneous'' and separate lists for
paperbacks in those categories, had been under consideration for
some time. The new list will mix all categories of children's
books, fiction and nonfiction, but in the beginning will show only
hardcover sales. Like the adult list, the children's list will have
15 slots.
</P>
<P>
   Some publishers have been advocating such a move for months,
complaining that a cluster of popular children's books can keep
deserving adult books off the lists. On Feb. 27, for instance, a
third of the places on the hardcover fiction list had children's
books: three Harry Potter books, ``The Legend of Luke'' by Brian
Jacques, and ``Bud, Not Buddy'' by Christopher Paul Curtis.
</P>
<P>
   The Harry Potter books, a series by the British author J.K.
Rowling about a young magician in training at the Hogwarts School
of Witchcraft and Wizardry, will have been on the list for 79 weeks
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping the Harry Potter books on the adult list also has its
advocates, said Deborah Hofmann, the editor of the best-seller
list. ``There are those who would argue that these books have a
strong following among adult readers.''
</P>
<P>
   But editors said that the change was supported by booksellers.
``Booksellers who report their weekly sales figures to us have
responded enthusiastically,'' Hofmann said, ``because more room is
now available.''
</P>
<P>
   The new list will include both picture and chapter books, unlike
the Publishers Weekly children's best-seller list, which divides
books into categories, including picture, chapter and paperback
books. The children's list will be derived from the same sources as
the adult list. The Times does not disclose those sources, but they
include about 4,000 bookstores and scores of wholesalers that sell
to 50,000 different outlets, including gift shops and department
stores. Sales from children's bookstores are expected to be added
to the rankings.
</P>
<P>
   Some books, like the Harry Potter series and the novels of John
Grisham, can make their debut at the top of the list, although it
usually takes two weeks or so after the publication date for
information about sales to be collected and printed.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, books that are published close together and are
part of the same series are listed simply by the series title.
</P>
<P>
   Hofmann said that the Book Review would ``for the most part be
guided by the publisher's own sense of whether the book is adult-
or youth-oriented. But, for instance, if it has been reviewed as an
adult book and retailers tell us it's getting most of its sales
from the youth market, we would be open to further discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   McGrath noted that ``if another `Harry Potter' came along, even
if it were only on the children's list, if it were a true crossover
book, it would be noticed'' by the public. ``Being on the kids'
best-seller list wouldn't ghettoize it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To accommodate the new children's list, the two pages of the
Book Review on which the adult hardcover and paperback best-seller
lists appear have been redesigned. The ``Advice and How To''
hardcover list, at the bottom of the hardcover list, is moving to
the paperback best-seller page, and the new children's book list
will replace it..
</P>
<P>
   Still, McGrath said, ``I don't want to rule out the possibility
we will adjust this. This is a work in progress.''

A SOFTWARE NICHE HEADED FOR HYPERGROWTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, June 25)  
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   By coincidence, on May 22, Vignette announced that it was buying
OnDisplay, and WebMethods trumpeted its acquisition of Active
Software.
</P>
<P>
   The deals, both billion-dollar-plus stock swaps, put a spotlight
on an obscure branch of the software industry _ enterprise
application integration. It makes for an awkward phrase, but the
companies in this niche could be poised for hypergrowth in the era
of electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Getting one software program to talk to another has been tricky
ever since a programmer created the second mainframe application
and tried to connect it to the first. As mainframes gave way to
minicomputers and minis to client server networks running packaged
applications, the problem worsened, becoming a sort of permanent
employment act for consultant armies.
</P>
<P>
   With the rush to conduct business online, connecting one
application to another has assumed greater urgency. Now a company
must not only make its own inventory program communicate with the
application that enters orders, but it must also make these pieces
of software connect to their counterparts at vendors and customers.
</P>
<P>
   Software integration has become too big a problem to address one
connection at a time, with custom software from consultants or
in-house programmers. So a gaggle of new companies _ including
those in last month's deals as well as Tibco Software, NEON
Systems, Vitria Technology and the Software Technologies Corp. _
have emerged to offer ready-made software to help stitch together
corporate America's patchwork quilt of business programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are very few categories of the software business that
have a greater long-term opportunity than this one,'' said Roger
McNamee, a partner in Integral Capital Partners, a venture capital
fund that began investing in many of these companies when they were
still private and continues to hold them as publicly traded stocks.
``They have an advantage over the average tech stock in that the
demand curve is vertical.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest reason has been the Internet-fueled proliferation of
specialized applications, all of which must be connected both to
so-called legacy applications _ those that companies have been
using for years to automate business processes _ and to every new
Web program that comes along.
</P>
<P>
   While it may be too early to pick the ultimate winners,
investors might consider buying a basket of these stocks. McNamee
particularly likes Vitria and Software Technologies, known as STC _
two companies with very different market profiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vitria is distinguished by focusing on the telecom industry,''
he said. ``The amount of legacy stuff in that industry is
staggering; the amount of change in new technology is equally
staggering, so it was perceived as too difficult. That's given them
something of a protected niche.''
</P>
<P>
   Software Technologies, one of the earliest entrants, is more
horizontal, working with many industries. ``STC is sort of the
everyman of the space,'' McNamee said.
</P>
<P>
   Most integration companies started by solving a particular
problem, often for a particular industry, and now must expand their
offerings in order to grow. One path is through acquisition, which
explains why WebMethods, a specialist in business-to-business
integration, acquired Active Software, a specialist in coordinating
applications within a business. Vignette, which sells software
designed to let companies personalize customers' interactions with
their Web-based systems, acquired OnDisplay to bolster its
business-to-business integration.
</P>
<P>
   The consolidation trend favors larger companies, particularly
those with big market capitalizations and premium stock prices _
potential currency for new acquisitions. That is why Rehan Syed, an
analyst at S.G. Cowen, has a buy recommendation on NEON and a
strong buy on Tibco.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe all these vendors will extend their capacities,
either through acquisitions or in-house development,'' Syed said.
``We think NEON, the largest company in the space, will continue to
do well. Tibco, as one of the largest, with a premium market cap,
is positioned well to be a consolidator.''
</P>
<P>
   The spring sell-off punished integration companies severely, as
technology investors gravitated toward blue-chip names like Sun
Microsystems, Oracle and Cisco Systems. So while some integration
companies still have sky-high price-to-earnings multiples _ or lack
earnings outright _ they are generally trading 50 percent or so
below their highs for the year.
</P>
<P>
   The main threat to the sector is that companies could change
their software buying patterns, moving away from mixing and
matching applications from many vendors and toward suites, which
include various applications that are designed to work together.
Oracle, in particular, is pushing a suite of back-office and
e-commerce applications, and Microsoft plans a technology called
BizTalk.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that you need these companies at all is a function of
how programs were built in the past,'' said Charles Phillips, an
analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. ``I think it will get easier
to connect third-party applications without creating another layer
of technology.''
</P>
<P>
   He is not alone. Jeff Wrona, portfolio manager of the $3.6
billion PBHG Technology and Communications fund, worries that
integration ``is quickly becoming a commodity.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Phillips sees opportunities in the sector. He has
an outperform rating on WebMethods and Software Technologies, both
of which were taken public by Morgan Stanley. ``From an investment
standpoint, this is a good time to look at these companies,'' he
said. ``The absolute size of the companies is still quite small.''

 &HT;    AOL, Time Warner gain shareholder approval of merger
 &HT;    By Marilyn Geewax and Matt Kempner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Shareholders of Time Warner and America Online didn't
get much time to celebrate Friday morning's overwhelming _ and
widely expected _ vote in favor of merging the biggest media and
online companies.
</P>
<P>
   Both stocks fell throughout the day, and after the market
closed, the Federal Communications Commission asked the companies
how America Online's AOLTV will affect competitors. The commission
also had questions about service the company provides over
high-speed digital lines used by phone companies. Approvals from
the FCC, the Federal Trade Commission and the European Union are
needed to complete the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The merger votes themselves proved cakewalks, with 99 percent of
the Time Warner shares and 97 percent of the America Online shares
favoring the deal. The Time Warner vote came in New York;
shareholders of America Online cast ballots in a hotel in Vienna,
Va., not far from the company's Dulles, Va., headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Now the companies have to convince regulators in the United
States and in Europe that they should be allowed to merge. If those
approvals are won, then the companies will have to integrate their
businesses and prove to investors that the deal makes sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm quite confident that in Europe and around the world, there
will be support for the merger,'' America Online Chairman and Chief
Executive Steve Case said Friday. He predicted the deal would be
completed by fall.
</P>
<P>
   Besides winning over regulators, the companies will have to show
Wall Street they can deliver on expectations. For example, the
companies have predicted that cash flow _ a commonly used measure
of media company performance _ will grow significantly faster
because of the combination.
</P>
<P>
   But Barry Hyman, an analyst with Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum, has
his doubts.
</P>
<P>
   He said the companies have predicted cash flow would grow 30
percent to 50 percent faster. ``I'm having difficulty accepting
that. I think that's one reason you have AOL trading at these
levels. Can they generate that substantial of an increase?''
</P>
<P>
   Similar doubts showed up among some America Online shareholders,
who have seen their stock drop from $73.75 just before the merger
was announced, to $53.38 on Friday, when it lost $2.88.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Halpern, from Washington D.C., rose twice at the America
Online meeting to ask when investors like herself would see their
stock appreciate again. She described America Online as ``the best
investment I ever made,'' but said she worries about the future.
</P>
<P>
   Case said he was certain the shares would rise sharply after the
companies combined to become the key player in ``the Internet
century.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the merged company would act like a ``growth'' stock,
continually reinvesting profits into new businesses. As a result,
it will not pay dividends, as Time Warner has.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about stocks prices were not limited to America Online
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Schein, a Miami resident visiting New York, said she has
part of her retirement in Time Warner stock, which fell $4.06
Friday to close at $77.56. But that's still well above the $64.75
close just before the merger deal was announced.
</P>
<P>
   Schein wanted a little investment advice from Time Warner
Chairman Gerald Levin. Saying she wants to retire in five years,
Schein asked what would the combined company's stock do over that
period. As a Time Warner shareholder, she would get 1.5 shares of
stock in the new company for each share of Time Warner stock she
owns. America Online shareholders would get one share in the new
company for each share of America Online they own.
</P>
<P>
   Levin declined to make a specific prediction, but said,
``Obviously, I appreciate the question because you and I are in the
same boat. I have my entire net worth in Time Warner stock.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, I am optimistic about the future,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner's biggest shareholder, Ted Turner, was not at the
meeting. Levin said Turner met with Time Warner executives earlier
in the week in New York. ``I suspect that today Ted has gone to
Montana.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been published reports that Turner has expressed
unhappiness with his role in the new company, where he would be one
of two vice chairmen but would no longer have direct control over
CNN and other Turner Broadcasting System units.
</P>
<P>
   Levin, responding to a shareholder, repeated his past insistence
that Turner will remain a strong leader in the new company. In
addition to Turner's stock holdings _ about 9 percent of Time
Warner's shares _ ``he has moral authority in our company,'' Levin
said.

 &HT;    AOL, Time Warner gain shareholder approval of merger
 &HT;    By Marilyn Geewax and Matt Kempner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Shareholders of Time Warner and America Online didn't
get much time to celebrate Friday morning's overwhelming _ and
widely expected _ vote in favor of merging the biggest media and
online companies.
</P>
<P>
   Both stocks fell throughout the day, and after the market
closed, the Federal Communications Commission asked the companies
how America Online's AOLTV will affect competitors. The commission
also had questions about service the company provides over
high-speed digital lines used by phone companies. Approvals from

shareholders of America Online cast ballots in a hotel in Vienna,

HOUSE APPROVES SPENDING ON ANTI-TOBACCO SUIT 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN A. HOLMES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For the second time in a week, the House has voted
to permit the Justice Department to use money from other federal
agencies in its lawsuit against tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   By a vote of 215-183, the House approved an amendment by Rep.
Henry Waxman, D-Calif., that allows the Justice Department to
receive $12 million from the departments of Veterans Affairs and
Health and Human Services to help support the lawsuit. The measure
had been strongly supported by the Clinton administration and
vigorously opposed by the House Republican leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the efforts of the House leadership, 55 Republicans
backed Waxman's amendment, more than offsetting the 35 Democrats
who voted against it.
</P>
<P>
   Approval of the measure marks the second time this week that the
House has defied the Republican leadership and approved a transfer
to the Justice Department to help finance the lawsuit. On Monday
the House voted to block the Department of Veterans Affairs from
transferring $4 million to the Justice Department. The following
day the House reversed itself and permitted Veterans Affairs to
send the funds to Justice.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Waxman's amendment to a bill to finance the
operations of the Commerce, Justice and State departments removed a
provision that would have banned the Justice Department from
receiving money from any agency to help in the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this settles the issue,'' Waxman said after the vote.
``I can't see how any other effort in any other legislation will
succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say, however, that they fully expect additional
efforts to limit the funds available to the Justice Department for
its litigation related to tobacco. Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, has
inserted language in the Senate version of the spending bill for
the Justice Department that prevents the transfer of funds for the
suit.
</P>
<P>
   Republican efforts to restrict or eliminate financing for the
lawsuit are one of several issues that have prompted Clinton to
threaten to veto the spending bill for the Commerce, Justice and
State departments. Clinton has also objected to the amounts
contained in the bill for such programs as hiring more police,
setting aside more land for national monuments and making
contributions to U.N. peace-keeping efforts.
</P>
<P>
   With such threats hanging over this spending measure and others,
most lawmakers expect tough negotiations with the president as the
fiscal year winds down in September. So far, the House has passed
nine of the 13 spending bills that must be enacted for the
government to continue to function. The Senate has approved three.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's action was the latest in a long line of skirmishes over
the lawsuit filed by the Justice Department that seeks to recover
from tobacco companies the money spent on health care by the
departments of Veterans Affairs, Health and Human Services, and
Defense.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the subcommittee that oversees the Justice Department
refused to grant the department's request for a $20 million
transfer from those three agencies to help pay for the litigation.
At the time, Rep. Harold Rogers of Kentucky, chairman of the
subcommittee, told Justice Department officials that they should
pay for the lawsuit out of their own operating funds.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno has said repeatedly that without
being able to use funds from other agencies the Justice Department
might not be able to advance the lawsuit.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   After being rebuffed by the subcommittee, the Justice Department
unilaterally requested $8 million from the three agencies without
informing the subcommittee, according to Rogers' office. Justice
Department officials justified their action by citing a 1995 law
that allowed it to request funds from the Pentagon to help defend
the Navy in a suit brought by contractors for a jet fighter.
</P>
<P>
   As the subcommittee drafted spending bills to fund the Justice
Department during the upcoming fiscal year that begins on Oct. 1,
Rogers included a provision that prevented the Justice Department
from once again asking the three agencies for financial help in
pressing the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1995 law was passed, the Justice Department has made
21 requests for a total of $324 million from other agencies to help
in lawsuits. In 17 of those cases, the Justice Department was
defending agencies that were being sued. The tobacco case is only
the fourth _ and by far the largest _ of the cases in which the
Justice Department requested funds in a case where the federal
government is the plaintiff.
</P>
<P>
   On the House floor on Friday, few Republicans spoke in defense
of tobacco companies. Instead, those who opposed Waxman's amendment
said they believed the 1995 law merely permitted the Justice
Department to use funds from other departments to defend that
department, not to file suits itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The statute is for defensive purposes,'' said Rogers. ``The
government is not to sue willy-nilly.''

 &HT;    BellSouth watches for opening
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As WorldCom and Sprint battle to save their $120
billion merger, BellSouth is pondering its options, wondering if a
blockbuster move would add needed muscle both in the United States
and overseas.
</P>
<P>
   As the industry consensus has it, the telecom future belongs to
a handful of large, global companies with a full range of services
_ especially data and wireless. And while Atlanta-based BellSouth
is nowhere near dropping an offer on the table, it is eyeing at
least two options for bulking up _ one dependent on a partial
collapse of WorldCom's deal to buy Sprint.
</P>
<P>
   WorldCom's purchase of Sprint is in trouble with U.S. and
European regulators, who are worried that the two companies
together would control too much of long-distance markets and the
transmission of Internet data. Together, Sprint and WorldCom would
handle nearly half the world's Internet data traffic and about
one-quarter of the U.S. long-distance market.
</P>
<P>
   But wireless _ the unit that WorldCom covets most intensely _
competes in a crowded market and would trigger little concern about
potential monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth's $100 billion bid for Sprint in October was trumped
by WorldCom. But if WorldCom is willing _ and permitted by U.S. and
European regulators _ to buy just Sprint's wireless business,
BellSouth could scoop up Sprint's long-distance, local and Internet
lines unit for probably half the price it was ready to pay for the
whole company.
</P>
<P>
   That is no slam-dunk: first, BellSouth would probably have to
outbid at least a few European suitors. Then, it would face the
current ban on entering the long-distance market, either delaying
the deal until it wins approval for long-distance or concocting
some kind of regulatory end-around.
</P>
<P>
   But there is also a second scenario, apparently under review
before WorldCom ran into regulatory whitewater: BellSouth would
combine with Denver-based Qwest Communications and U S West _ two
companies about to merge _ as well as Dutch-based KPN Telecom and
KPN Qwest, a European joint venture.
</P>
<P>
   From that deal would emerge a $50 billion-a-year company with
local service in 23 states and a pumped-up Euro presence in data
and wireless.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth already has an investment in Qwest and a partnership
with KPN, but a ``menage-a-cinq'' would be a bold step for a
company that has always shied from any investment that
substantially diluted earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Yet BellSouth has already made a series of big-ticket moves this
year that signal an increased willingness to take chances _ and to
spend money.
</P>
<P>
   The most dramatic shift in BellSouth's image came in October
with its $100 billion bid to buy Sprint _ half of it in cash. While
eventually falling short, that offer did force WorldCom to dig
deeper into its own pockets to make the purchase.
</P>
<P>
   And since then, BellSouth has:
</P>
<P>
   partnered with Dutch-based KPN Telecom.
</P>
<P>
   forged a deal to spin off its U.S. wireless unit in a national
venture with SBC Communications.
</P>
<P>
   announced plans to use a satellite to deliver television
throughout the Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   announced plans to create a tracking stock for its Latin
American investments.
</P>
<P>
   And BellSouth, which for years has courted and eventually
rejected suitors, is ever more open to marriage.
</P>
<P>
   The mood swing comes partly because telecom continues to
consolidate. But that attitude is also shaped by knowledge that a
small group of European companies are aching to enter the U.S.
market and are looking at acquisitions, perhaps of companies like
BellSouth.
</P>
<P>
   Among them, the most often mentioned are France Telecom, NTT of
Japan and German-based Deutsche Telekom. All hunger for a U.S.
presence like the 15 million customers held by Sprint
long-distance. Looking to extend its reach, Deutsche Telekom
recently won shareholder approval to spend nearly $100 billion for
such acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth's stock was worth about $85 billion at the close of
business Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation has raged about the WorldCom-Sprint deal in the
weeks since Legg Mason analyst Scott Cleland called it ``a dead man
walking.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department staff has recommended against the merger,
and the department itself seems emboldened by its success in
fighting Microsoft. Meanwhile, competition experts from the 15
European Union states reportedly supported EU Competition
Commissioner Mario Monti's draft decision to block the merger,
according to Reuters.
</P>
<P>
   A final decision in Europe is due on July 5.
</P>
<P>
   But with European regulators in Washington this week, some kind
of compromise could be hammered out. And the companies were
reportedly negotiating feverishly with regulators Friday.
</P>
<P>
   If no agreement is reached, the companies will abandon the deal,
Reuters reported
</P>
<P>
   Monti has suggested that he will take a tough line, perhaps
because of residual resentment of WorldCom for the way it handled
its merger with MCI. As part of that deal, MCI's Internet
``backbone'' was sold to British-based Cable &AMP; Wireless _ which
later charged WorldCom with bargaining in bad faith.

&HT;     GORE RELEASES TRANSCRIPT OF FBI INTERVIEW ON FUND-RAISER 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARK HELM  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore, whose presidential campaign
has been rocked by calls for a new probe of his 1996 fund-raising
activities, on Friday released a 150-page transcript of his
interview with a federal prosecutor two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   It showed Gore heatedly denying under oath any wrongdoing about
his role in a controversial 1996 luncheon at a Buddhist temple near
Los Angeles. He has consistently said he did not know the event was
a fundraiser.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sure as hell don't recall having _ I sure as hell did not
have any conversations with anyone saying this is a fund-raising
</P>
<P>
   event,'' Gore testified. ``As to whether or not I had any
follow-up conversations that said, were we able to set up this
event or not, I don't think I did. But I may have ... ''
</P>
<P>
   Gore told reporters Friday on his campaign plane that he was
releasing the entire April 18 transcript because ``I think the
truth is my friend in this. I have full confidence in the judgment
of the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president, who was on his way to a fund-raiser in
California, added that he wanted ``people to judge for
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., who has been holding
hearing into campaign finance abuses, announced that the head of
the Justice Department's campaign finance unit had recommended to
Attorney General Janet Reno that a special counsel be appointed to
investigate the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   According to Specter, Robert J. Conrad Jr. told Reno that during
the interview that he and two FBI agents conducted with Gore,
questions arose about the vice president's truthfulness about the
luncheon he attended at the Hsi Lai Buddhist Temple in Hacienda
Heights, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The transcript shows that although Conrad questioned Gore on
several topics, he returned repeatedly to the temple fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   ``You were aware in late February (of 1996), were you not, that
there was a goal of raising $108 million by the DNC (Democratic
National Committee)?'' Gore was asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' the vice president replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then a couple of months later there is a DNC-sponsored event
at the temple and it didn't raise any fund-raising issues in your
mind?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not know this was a fund-raiser,'' Gore answered.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Reno refused to say Friday whether she will
appoint a special counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at her weekly news conference, she said only that any
investigation into the matter should be done ``carefully and
without commenting on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno also vowed that she would not bend to public or media
pressure in the case. ``If we let some in the media push
inappropriately without knowing the facts, if we let people think
that because they leak something they can pressure us into
decisions, that just won't work,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   According to congressional sources, Reno was angry about the
leak to Specter and has launched an internal investigation into how
it occurred.
</P>
<P>
   During the news conference, Reno also was asked about the timing
of the leak and whether it would affect the presidential race
between Gore and Republican candidate George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to make sure the investigation is done the right way,
that it is done to seek justice so it is done fairly so it does not
interfere with the democratic process,'' the attorney general said.
``I am going to do everything in my power to see that any decision
that I make is made without political influence from anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   This latest call for a new probe could spell serious trouble for
Gore, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, by raising
more questions about his veracity in the midst of the 2000
campaign. The appointment of a special counsel in itself would
provide new fodder for Republicans, and any such inquiry could
easily continue through the November election.
</P>
<P>
   After announcing the White House release of the transcript, Gore
raised questions about the timing of the recommendation and its
public disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the timing is a comment in and of itself,'' he said.
``Here we are four months before a national election ''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was suggesting political motives within the Justice
Department, he said, ``I'm not going to go beyond what I've said. I
think the timing speaks for itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also rejected suggestions that his April 18 interview with
the prosecutors had been confrontational. ``I have told the truth.
I have cooperated fully,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he did not think people would ``find anger reflected''
in his answers and that during the interview he ``concentrated on
being cooperative.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have admitted that I made mistakes in fund-raising but I
have always told the truth about this matter,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   During his campaign stop in Northern California, Gore attended a
luncheon to raise $500,000 for the Democratic National Committee.
At a dinner in San Francisco Friday night he was expected to raise
another $1 million for the DNC.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, on his way to a campaign stop in Alabama Friday, said the
questions about Gore's fund raising are ``indicative of what has
gone on'' in the Clinton administration. ``I reiterate my call for
a new tone in Washington, which is going to require a new
administration,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Conrad's recommendation puts new pressure on Reno, who rejected
an earlier recommendation from one of Conrad's predecessors,
Charles G. LaBella, as well as from FBI Director Louis Freeh, to
ask for an independent counsel to investigate Gore. She also
declined to do so after two preliminary investigations of Gore's
role in Democratic fund-raising telephone calls from his White
House office.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general has been strongly criticized by Republican
lawmakers and officials for past refusals to seek an independent
investigation of the Democrats' fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   Justice officials insist that the department's campaign finance
unit, set up shortly after the 1996 presidential election, has
``vigorously'' pursued all leads and has succeeded in winning 17
convictions. Conrad was appointed by Reno six months ago to head
the unit.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Reno declined to appoint an independent counsel to
investigate whether a former White House aide, Harold M. Ickes,
lied to a Senate committee about his activities on behalf of the
Teamsters union. In December 1998, she found no reasonable grounds
to seek the appointment of an independent counsel to investigate
President Clinton's role in the 1996 Democratic fund-raising
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who was previously questioned four times by campaign
finance investigators, was interrogated for four hours by Conrad
and the FBI agents on April 18.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has said that he was unaware that the luncheon, attended by
saffron-robed nuns and monks, was a fund-raiser, although he has
acknowledged that he knew it was finance-related.
</P>
<P>
   The event, which lacked the conventional trappings of a
fund-raiser such as expressions of thanks for contributions,
nonetheless raised $140,000 for the Democratic National Committee.
Much of the money was later returned when questions arose about the
donors. Longtime Gore fund-raiser Maria Hsia was convicted this
year of campaign finance violations, which included disguising the
true source of donations given by the temple's nuns and monks.
</P>
<P>
   Under rules that took effect last July after the independent
counsel law lapsed, the attorney general must appoint a special
counsel from outside the Justice Department when a criminal
investigation ``would present a conflict of interest for the
department.''
</P>
<P>
   An attorney named to the special counsel's post does not have
the same degree of autonomy as an independent counsel had under the
lapsed law. While a special counsel would be free to structure any
probe as he or she sees fit and to exercise independent judgment
about whether to bring criminal charges, the regulations make it
clear that the ultimate responsibility for the handling of the
matter remains with the attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   The only special counsel named under the new regulations is
former senator John C. Danforth (R-Mo.), who is looking into
whether the FBI contributed to the deaths of 74 people at the
Branch Davidian compound near Waco, Tex., and then engaged in a
cover-up.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Reno defended her decisions in 1997 and 1998 not to
appoint an independent counsel, saying she still believes she made
the right decision based on the information available for review at
the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to look at specific evidence,'' she said. ``If you look
at that and all that has come out based on the information we had
at the time the decision was correct.''

EUROPE'S AIRBUS ANNOUNCES 555-PASSENGER JUMBO JET CHALLENGE TO
BOEING 
</HEADLINE>
   By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ In a huge gamble to displace the mighty but
aging Boeing 747 jumbo jet, Airbus Industrie announced Friday that
it plans to build a gigantic rival with enough room for 555
passengers and amenities like a restaurant and bedrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Though the decision had been expected for months, it set the
stage for one of the most dramatic wagers yet in the aerospace
industry.
</P>
<P>
   The family of aircraft, designated A3XX, will cost $12 billion
to develop. The A3XX will be two stories high, have a range of
8,150 miles and probably carry a price of about $230 million.
</P>
<P>
   If the A3XX succeeds, it would end Boeing 747's three-decade
monopoly in jumbo jets. The loss of that monopoly, with its
relatively fat profit margins, could in turn deprive Boeing of its
ability to finance growth in more competitive markets for smaller
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   But the risks to Airbus are extraordinary. Boeing executives
have argued for years that there is only a tiny market for
super-jumbo jets, because passengers are increasingly avoiding huge
central ``hubs'' of air transport in favor of direct flights to
smaller cities and smaller planes.
</P>
<P>
   However, Boeing is also preparing for the possibility of
building a stretched-out version of the 747, which it says would
cost only $3 billion to $4 billion to develop.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is either going to be huge, or it is going to be real, real
bad,'' said Todd Ernst, an aerospace analyst at Prudential
Securities, referring to the A3XX. ``There isn's much room for a
middle ground here.''
</P>
<P>
   Airbus executives also announced a long-awaited restructuring of
the company from an unwieldy consortium of four companies _
Aerospatiale Matra of France; DaimlerChrysler's aerospace unit in
Germany; BAE Systems PLC of Britain, formerly known as British
Aerospace; and Construcciones Aeronauticas SA of Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus will be a single corporation 80 percent controlled by the
European Aeronautics Defense &AMP; Space Co. EADS, as that company is
known, in a merger of all the Airbus partners except BAE Systems.
</P>
<P>
   After months of negotiating, BAE Systems agreed to accept a 20
percent stake in Airbus and let EADS retain the rest. EADS is now
launching an initial public stock offering, to be completed July
10, which is expected to raise about $3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at EADS say the conversion of Airbus into a
conventional corporation will save money, eliminate inefficiency
and streamline the clumsy decision-making that had plagued the old
consortium.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a tremendous competition, a fair-play match
between Boeing and Airbus,'' said Jean-Luc Lagardere, Airbus'
co-chief executive, at a news conference Friday in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   It may well become a political battle as well. European
governments are expected to lend Airbus much of the up-front
development money. Although that is allowed, it may provoke
protests from the U.S. Congress about improper subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   The A3XX hardly amounts to a revolution in air transportation,
but it would be different. Its initial version will have enough
room for more than 500 passengers, compared with 420 seats on the
747-400.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on what the airline itself wanted to do, Airbus
executives say the extra space could be used to offer a
round-the-clock cocktail lounge, a library, a playing area for
small children or a medical clinic.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the behemoth could also be configured as a
monstrous can of sardines. By cramming in as many seats as
possible, the airplane could hold more than 900 passengers on the
two decks.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus executives argue that advances in technology and
materials will make it possible to reduce the A3XX's operating
costs by as much as 25 percent in comparison to the Boeing 747-400.
</P>
<P>
   But that will not count for much if airlines conclude that they
cannot keep the huge airplanes loaded with passengers. If Boeing is
right and Airbus is wrong, the A3XX would quickly turn into a
lumbering and underused elephant on many routes.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus executives argue that the steady growth in air travel
requires bigger and more efficient aircraft. They predict that the
number of people flying will increase by at least 5 percent a year
for the foreseeable future, and that airports and airlines will be
overwhelmed unless there are much bigger aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Airports that handle 30 million passengers a year right now
will have 60 million in 10 years from now,'' said Alain Dupiech, a
spokesman for Airbus. ``You have limits. Nobody wants to have to
take off or land at 2 o'clock in the morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing executives agree that long-distance air travel will
increase, but they say the nature of the travel is changing.
Instead of flying between major hubs like New York and Tokyo,
passengers will increasingly demand to bypass the hubs and fly
directly to smaller destinations.
</P>
<P>
   The result, in Boeing's view, is that total demand for
super-jumbo jets will be only 400 or 500 planes during the next 20
years. Airbus executives predict it will be about 1,200.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Airbus needs to sell at least 200 of the A3XXs to
break even on its investment, and at least 600 to reach Airbus' own
profit targets.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus executives say eight companies have expressed
``interest'' in buying a total of 52 A3XXs. Of those, five have
have identified themselves publicly: Air France, Singapore
Airlines, Virgin Atlantic, Emirates Airlines and International
Lease Finance Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Most other big airlines have refused to tip their hands yet.
Lufthansa of Germany has said it is not yet ready to place any
orders.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's announcement does not represent a point-of-no-return
for Airbus. Officially, the company merely announced its readiness
to start taking orders. If all goes as planned, development would
start at the end of this year and the first planes would be
delivered in 2005.

SUPPORT IN HOUSE GROWS FOR EASING CUBA EMBARGO

 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After four decades of an economic embargo against
Cuba, a proposal to allow food and medicine sales to the communist
nation is experiencing a groundswell of support in the US House,
where it may be approved as early as next week.
</P>
<P>
   But advocates of the measure, who for years have argued the Cuba
ban is outdated and futile, admit that some of the credit for the
growing number of endorsements belongs to someone else.
</P>
<P>
   Elian Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Before the plight of the 6-year-old refugee focused national
attention on the communist island, they say, most constituents gave
little thought to whether the US policy made sense. Nor, they say,
was there much interest in bucking the powerful Cuban-American
community, which until recently operated largely outside the public
spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   And while a number of other factors have helped renew the Cuba
debate in Congress _ including a vote to expand trade relations
with another communist nation, China, and a new study showing that
American farmers could earn millions of dollars in sales to Cuba _
almost no one can explain the growing interest in Cuban trade
policy without eventually mentioning the little boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been worrying about this for six or seven years, but we
never thought it would come this quickly,'' said Representative J.
Joseph Moakley, Democrat of Massachusetts, a longtime supporter of
increased ties with Cuba. ``It's the Elian thing. Elian has done
his people some good.''
</P>
<P>
   The pending agreement, which would allow US companies to sell
food and medicine to Cuba but bar Cuban companies from exporting
goods to the United States, still faces stiff opposition from
Cuban-American leaders in Congress. But a similar measure has
passed in the Senate before, and would probably do so again this
year. Even though the Senate this week rejected a bill to study
changing overall US-Cuba policy, the Senate is generally more
favorable toward free trade than the House.
</P>
<P>
   More significantly, House Republican leaders have in recent
weeks indicated they no longer oppose relaxing sanctions outright.
Instead, they have agreed to try to work out a compromise that
would satisfy both sides.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations are delicate: Many Republicans do not want
Cuban leader Fidel Castro, or businesses within his reach, to have
any dealings with US banks. They are, therefore, demanding the
legislation specify that Cuba pay for all food and medicine
purchases with cash. Advocates of the bill say that requiring
cash-only deals would be almost the same as keeping the sanctions
in place.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, some opponents are outraged that the
legislation would also ease food and medicine sales to several
other countries, including Libya and Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Still, House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, an Illinois Republican,
last week said an agreement was ``about there.'' And Representative
Robert Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat long opposed to lifting Cuba
sanctions, said the most remarkable development is that there have
been any negotiations at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe we're giving (them) a major break, a major
concession, because we don't believe in sales to Cuba, period,''
said Menendez, one of several House members insisting on the
agreement mandating cash-only deals.
</P>
<P>
   Justifying the Cuba embargo has become increasingly difficult
for many in the House, especially those who voted last month to
normalize trade relations with China. During that debate, many
pro-business Republicans argued that engaging China economically
would encourage democratic change. That caused many legislators to
wonder: Wouldn't the same theory apply to Cuba?
</P>
<P>
   ``The China debate has led to a natural questioning of whether
our Cuba policy is appropriate,'' said Representative James P.
McGovern, a Massachusetts Democrat. ``On all fronts, there is much
more activity on Cuba than there has been at any time I can
remember.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the US agriculture industry has begun a
massive push to open trade relations with Cuba, arguing its
proximity and its fundamental need for food could be a gold mine
for American farmers.
</P>
<P>
   According to a study commissioned by the World Policy Institute,
a New York-based think tank, the partial relaxation of sanctions
being considered in the House could lead to $444 million a year in
food and medicine sales, as well as 6,000 related US jobs. If the
embargo were lifted entirely, the effects could mean $1.6 billion a
year in US sales, plus approximately 20,000 associated US jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even the economic analyst who conducted the study, Paula
Stern, former chairwoman of the US International Trade Commission,
said the chief reason for the sudden fascination with Cuba is
largely due to one boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've all been interested in seeing how quickly public opinion
has moved with regards to Cuba,'' Stern said. ``Everyone is an
expert now on Cuba because of Elian. I believe the reason why the
legislation is moving has to do with the fact that the general
public is looking at Cuba.'' In the past, she said, Cuba was
watched by ``just a small and energized group who oppose trade.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some believe that group of powerful Cuban-Americans,
now represented to the world by the Miami relatives of Elian
Gonzalez, may be partly responsible for any momentum the embargo
bill has gained.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Fernandez, the press officer for the Cuban Interest Section
in Washington that represents that country, said the Miami
relatives _ who cloistered Elian in their home and were often
depicted by federal law enforcement officials as unreasonable _
drew attention to views that are out of step with the rest of the
country. ``The American people have had the chance to know exactly
what kind of people these right-wing Cuban-Americans are,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Menendez called that ``wishful thinking.'' And he said there was
still time for the embargo bill to backfire, inspiring the
Cuban-American community to redouble its attempts to defeat it.
``Whatever negativity might be perceived as a result of the Elian
issue will fuel their efforts,'' he said.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ On June 9, shares of MicroStrategy Inc. soared 41
percent on talk that the company, a financially troubled software
maker, would get financing from outside investors.
</P>
<P>
   Last Monday, a group led by Promethean Asset Management invested
$125 million in convertible preferred stock that will give it a 4
percent stake in the company. By Friday, MicroStrategy's stock had
fallen 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   What gives? Investors doing some investigation may be spooked by
the details. A handful of companies in similar deals have troubling
stories to tell.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, RoweCom, an Internet company in Westwood, Mass.,
raised $20 million from Promethean and other investors. Seven
months later, out of concern for shareholders, the company redeemed
the securities. Paul Burmeister, RoweCom's chief financial officer,
said he would never do another such deal. ``The downside offers too
much risk to existing equity holders,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, raising money with convertibles gives struggling
companies cash they need. Their attraction grows as investors in
plain vanilla stocks get pickier. And they are; witness the 19
percent drop in Amazon.com's stock on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Companies go into these deals hoping to thrive. If the stock
goes up, the investors may be content to collect the dividends on
their preferred shares. Management has some control over when the
private investors can convert their holdings into common stock, and
hence over the dilution to existing shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   But if the company's stock price falls to a certain level,
called a trigger, the investor can convert at will. Then,
shareholder dilution gets really nasty, because the lower the stock
price, the greater the stake that the investors get in the company.
The preferred investors' interests are counter to those of common
stock holders.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Proxymed Inc., a health care information services
company, raised $15 million in convertible preferred stock with
Promethean and other investors last December. When the company's
stock fell below the $4.21 trigger price, it offered to redeem the
securities for cash. According to the company's proxy statement,
one of the investors declined, choosing instead to convert $1.7
million worth into shares of common stock that had fallen to around
$1. As a result, the company's shares outstanding rose by 9.4
percent, a big dilution to existing stockholders. Proxymed
officials declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies report significant increases in short selling of
their stocks following such deals. In November 1998, Ariad
Pharmaceuticals sold $3 million in convertible preferred stock to
investors, including Promethean. The following October, Ariad sued
Promethean, claiming that the firm manipulated the price of Ariad's
stock by selling short its shares after the deal was struck.
</P>
<P>
   According to the suit, the manipulation drove Ariad's stock from
$1.81 a share to 53 cents a share between June and October 1999.
The suit also said that Promethean admitted to Ariad officials that
it had conducted ``massive short sales'' of the company's stock.
The amount of shares sold short rose from 56,519 to 1.8 million
after the preferred deal took place, according to the suit.
</P>
<P>
   The suit was settled last January, and neither Ariad nor
Promethean officials would comment. But as part of the settlement,
Promethean agreed that it would not buy or sell short Ariad
securities for four years.
</P>
<P>
   The investors in MicroStrategy can convert their shares at any
time, at a price that will be determined in the coming weeks. If
they are inclined to sell the stock short, there no provisions in
the deal to stop them.
</P>
<P>
   Mark S. Lynch, chief financial officer of MicroStrategy, said
the company had done a due diligence review of Promethean and that
he was comfortable with the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Promethean would be inclined to sell MicroStrategy
shares short, one partner, James F. O'Brien Jr., said, ``If we ever
get concerned with our investment, will we either sell or look to
protect ourselves? Sure.'' But, he stressed, the firm is very
positive about MicroStrategy.

MILLENNIUM, AVENTIS SET $450 MILLION DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Millennium Pharmaceuticals Inc., Massachusetts' largest
biotechnology company, announced a $450 million deal with Aventis
SA Friday to create, develop, and market a new line of
anti-inflammatory drug products.
</P>
<P>
   Millennium executives said the deal with Europe's fourth-largest
pharmaceutical company will help transform the Cambridge company
from a genomics firm to a full-fledged drug-development company.
</P>
<P>
   The five-year Aventis deal calls for both companies to share
their drug discovery technologies, co-develop, test, manufacture
and share equally in the profits of their jointly developed drugs
in the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   For products outside North America, Aventis wil pay Millennium
royalties based on sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time where a genomics drug discovery and a
pharmaceutical company combine their respective pipelines of
pre-clincial drugs in one field for an exclusive relationship for
five years and beyond,'' said Mark Levin, Millennium's founder and
chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, Aventis will pay as much as $40 million a
year for five years to access Millennium's proprietary drug
discovery technology with the goal of finding drug candidates to
treat such diseases as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, and certain
allergies.
</P>
<P>
   The alliances enables ``scientists the opportunity to work
side-by-side in the joint discovery of new technologies and new
anti-inflammatory drugs,'' Aventis executive vice president Frank
L. Douglas said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Aventis will also purchase $250 million of Millennium stock over
the next 17 months _ $150 million at the closing of the deal by
July 6 and $100 million in two purchases next year. Based on the
company's stock price of $120 a share, Aventis will own about about
2 percent of Millennium shares _ well below the stake of German
pharmaceutical firm Bayer A.G., which owns 10.84 percent of
company.
</P>
<P>
   Friday Millennium shares closed at $119.5625, down $4.9375.
</P>
<P>
   The Aventis partnership _ second in size to a $465 million
agreement with Bayer _ raises the total value of Millenniun's
pharmaceutical agreements to $1.8 billion. By contrast,
Millennium's first drug-discovery deal was a five-year, $70 million
agreement with Hoffmann La Roche. One of the compounds that
Millennium helped develop was an anti-obesity medication that
Hoffmann La Roche will begin testing later this year.
</P>
<P>
   During a press conference Friday morning, Aventis officials
explained they were looking to partner with an American
biotechnology company that had technology and promising new
products.
</P>
<P>
   ``We analyzed gaps in our R&AMP;D efforts and found them in genomics
and informatics,'' said Thomas Hofstaetter Aventis' head of
corporate development. ``Millennium can fill these gaps.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday's agreement caps a series of converstations between the
two companies that began last summer, according to Alan Crane,
Millennium's vice president and head of business development.
Millennium, which employs more than 1,500 people will be adding
chemists, toxicologists, and pharmacologists to its staff as part
of Aventis agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be the biopharmaceutical company of the future, not
just a biotech or technology-oriented company but a fully
integrated firm,'' Crane said. ``This relationsip with Aventis
helps us get there.''

   &QL;  ATTENTION EDITORS: THIS IS THE REAL VOTE CHART! WASHINGTON
WATCH VOTE CHART Questions regarding this transmission should be
directed to 202-628-3100, Ext. 218. WASHINGTON, June 23 -- The
following chart shows how senators and representatives voted on key
bills and amendments within the last week. A ``Y'' means the member
voted for the measure; an ``N'' means the member voted against the
measure; a ``?'' means the member did not vote; and a ``P'' means
the member voted ``present.''
</P>
<P>
   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: Federal
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Tuesday approved, 57-42, an amendment by Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., to enhance federal enforcement of hate
crimes. Part of the Defense Appropriations bill, the provision
would allow the prosecution of violent crimes based on a victim's
sexual orientation, gender or disability. Supporters contented it
would punish hate crimes. Opponents assert it would infringe on
state and local law enforcement. A ``yes'' vote supports federal
hate crime legislation.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: State
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Tuesday passed, 50-49, a measure by Sen. Orrin
Hatch, R-Utah, to study and support hate crime investigations by
state and local law enforcement agencies. The measure is part of
the Defense Appropriations bill. Supporters argued that the measure
would create a strong and workable assistance program for state and
local law enforcement. Opponents contended that the provision would
not protect all Americans from hate crimes. A ``yes'' vote
supported state and local funding to prevent and prosecute hate
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: Helicopter
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Wednesday rejected, 47-51, an amendment to provide
at least $110 million for helicopters to stem the cultivation of
drugs in Colombia as part of a Foreign Operations Appropriations
bill. Proponents said it would have allowed the military to use
Black Hawks, which can fly higher and farther than other
helicopters. Opponents complained that Black Hawks were expensive
to operate and maintain. A ``yes'' vote supports funds for
helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   4) BILL NUMBER: Medicare
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday rejected, 44-53, a provision to contain
the cost of Medicare prescription drugs and encourage competition
among private providers. The amendment would have been part of an
appropriations bill for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human
Services, and Education. Supporters said it would help the aged.
Opponents wanted insurance companies not Medicare to provide drug
benefits. A ``no'' vote limits Medicare benefits and services.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   HOUSE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: Tobacco
</P>
<P>
   The House on Monday rejected, 197-207, an amendment to transfer
medical care funding to the Justice Department for lawsuits against
tobacco companies. The measure would have been part of the
Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development
Appropriations bill. Supporters hoped to continue federal lawsuits
against tobacco companies. Opponents said that the amendment would
take needed funding from veterans' medical treatment. A ``no'' vote
stops funds for the Clinton administration to sue the tobacco
industry.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: EPA
</P>
<P>
   The House on Wednesday approved, 226-199, a provision to
prohibit the Environmental Protection Agency from identifying areas
with high levels of ozone. The amendment is part of the Departments
of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development
Appropriations bill. Supporters said the measure would protect
communities from the stigma of having a poor air rating. Opponents
argued it would weaken the agency. A ``yes'' vote restricts EPA
programs.

<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe _ The old heroes sing liberation songs and
predict an overwhelming victory for President Robert Mugabe and his
ruling party. But the party's local youth leader smells trouble in
the air as he campaigns in poor rural villages.
</P>
<P>
   The youth leader, Ocean Mudzivo, has taken to searching funerals
and festivals for converts because young people no longer flock to
his political rallies. He talks of land and liberation, but the
young say he belongs to the party of the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``They ask, `Why should we vote for you? We have no work, and
even you are doing nothing,''' said Mudzivo, 39, who was imprisoned
as a teen-ager for supporting Zimbabwe's struggle against white
minority rule. Today, he works odd jobs and grows vegetables to
survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no answer for them,'' he continued. ``I am a leader in
my party, and I cannot give up on it. But the party will have to
change.''
</P>
<P>
   This weekend Zimbabweans vote in parliamentary elections that
will challenge the overwhelming dominance of Mugabe's ruling party,
the Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front, for the first
time in the country's 20-year history. And as Mugabe campaigned
across the country Friday, he urged people to remember the past and
to stay true to the party that helped liberate them from white
rule.
</P>
<P>
   But the old message is being delivered to a changing nation.
</P>
<P>
   Today, about a third of the population consists of young people
who were either children in 1980, when majority rule was achieved,
or were born shortly after. And a significant percentage of the 5.8
million voters have registered since February, after the ruling
party suffered its first major political defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Even within the ruling party itself, the generation gap is
widening. For the first time, dozens of politicians have defected
from Mugabe to run as independent candidates, many of them men in
their 30s and 40s who see little future for themselves in a party
still dominated by aging freedom fighters.
</P>
<P>
   And as voters cast their ballots at 4,000 polling places, many
will ask themselves: Can the party of liberation transform itself
into a party that addresses unemployment and corruption along with
traditional issues of land redistribution and black empowerment? Or
can people trust a new, untested opposition party that has gained
popularity by promising honest government and an improving economy?
</P>
<P>
   There are still fears that the elections will be marred by
violence or fraud. Tensions are high, and about 300 foreign
observers and 30,000 local police officers are now stationed in 10
provinces, after a violent political campaign during which at least
26 people were killed and more than 1,000 white farms were invaded
by black squatters.
</P>
<P>
   There is little doubt that Mugabe's government will cede some
power to the new opposition. His party currently controls all but
three seats in Parliament, and the opposition, the Movement for
Democratic Change, is contesting all 120 seats that are up for
election. Some government officials acknowledge that they will
likely lose their near-total grip on power, though they differ on
how many seats will be lost.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what the result, prominent members of the party that
has always dominated politics here are already admitting that they
will have to change their message and perhaps reshuffle their ranks
to appeal to a younger and increasingly urban population.
</P>
<P>
   ``The generation gap is the problem,'' John Nkomo, the campaign
manager for Mugabe's party, said in an interview. ``The young
people, the so-called born frees, haven't got the feeling I have,
the humiliation I felt under white rule, the suffering I felt.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``These young people have been to school with the children of
the white farmers,'' said Nkomo, who is also the minister of local
government and national housing. ``They don't know these feelings.
Even within the party, some of our chaps say we are led by people
who are too old.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of us feel it would not be the best thing to do to reduce
the number of senior people right now. But once we have resolved
this period of transition, you will see younger people in and older
people out.''
</P>
<P>
   The party has already begun to address issues important to the
disaffected. In recent months, the government began cracking down
on corruption and publicizing the victories of young, reform-minded
politicians in party primaries. Last week Mugabe, 76, acknowledged
at a rally here that the nation was suffering from soaring
inflation and joblessness, and he promised to re-introduce price
controls.
</P>
<P>
   But party members fear the new approach may have come too late
to blunt the challenge. And similar anxieties are rippling across
much of southern Africa, where parties associated with liberation
movements in South Africa, Namibia and Mozambique still dominate
national politics.
</P>
<P>
   In South Africa, where nearly 60 percent of people between the
ages of 18 and 20 did not register to vote in last year's
presidential election, the African National Congress is already
opening a campaign to woo young people. In Namibia, a new
opposition party drew much of its strength from young voters. And
even though the ruling party there gained strength in last year's
parliamentary elections, the worrying parallels between Zimbabwe
and Namibia have dominated newspapers and radio talk shows there.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   It is not that the old ideals no longer resonate. People still
speak proudly about how Mugabe dramatically expanded access for the
entire population to schools and clinics during his first decade in
power. Many share his bitterness at the legacy of British
colonialism and white minority rule, which left the tiny white
minority in control of more than half of the country's fertile land
and most of the economy. And many express deep misgivings about the
opposition party's alliance with white farmers and business
executives, who have not rushed to help resolve the economic and
racial inequities in this country.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can never win election, not when they are a stooge of the
white man, not when they are there to defend the rights of the
whites, the white settlers in a situation of social and economic
balance,'' Mugabe told cheering supporters Friday as he attacked
the opposition party.
</P>
<P>
   But for growing numbers of people, the worries about land and
whites are overwhelmed by the frustration at the government's
inefficiency, mismanagement and corruption in the face of a
contracting economy.
</P>
<P>
   In the last decade, the percentage of people living in poverty
has surged to more than 60 percent, from 40 percent. Wages have
fallen to pre-independence levels. The government can no longer pay
creditors, buy enough fuel or supply medicines to hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   And one of the country's most most popular musicians, Thomas
Mapfumo, who once sang in praise of Mugabe's government, recently
shot to the top of the local charts with a song titled
``Disaster,'' which chronicles the country's recent decline.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Voter apathy has been one of the most vivid signs of public
disengagement and discontent with what has become virtually a
one-party state.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, when blacks finally won majority rule, 84 percent of
voters voted in national elections, according to the U.N.
Development Program. In the last parliamentary elections, in 1995,
that figure had fallen to 26 percent. And by last year, in local
elections, the turnout plunged to 10 percent.
</P>

   ``Zanu-PF pretends they're in touch with the people, but they're
blind,'' said Albert Meke, 43, a politician who defected from the
ruling party to run as an independent candidate in Chivi. ``Young
people _ some of them are for the new opposition because they are
unemployed and the MDC is promising to address those issues,'' said
Meke, who had been a member of the ruling party for decades and has
served in Parliament for nearly two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the government were making those efforts, young people
would feel more secure,'' he added. ``Some of the hardships we are
experiencing are of our own making.''

 &HT;    Thrashers prepared for any offers at draft
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALGARY _ As the Thrashers prepared for their second entry draft
today, the team's general manager said he realized predicting the
team's first selection would be futile. A year ago, a decision
wasn't made until a blur of trades was consummated 10 minutes
before Don Waddell walked up to the podium and announced Patrik
Stefan as the first pick.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know what's going to be presented to you, but
nothing has been presented so far,'' Waddell said Friday. ``If
anything does happen, it'll happen right before the draft again.''
</P>
<P>
   Which, of course, wasn't stopping any media outlet and lobby
lizard from speculating on trade rumors and how today's annual
lottery will unfold. The Thrashers pick second after the New York
Islanders, who appear split on who they will take first. If they
don't trade the pick, the Islanders likely will select Slovakian
left winger Marian Gaborik or Wisconsin left winger Dany Heatley.
</P>
<P>
   Or Boston University goalie Rick DiPietro.
</P>
<P>
   The Thrashers are interested in three players: Heatley, Czech
defenseman Rostislav Klesla and Gaborik _ probably in that order,
although Waddell was not tipping his hand Friday. ``We've gone back
and forth on this,'' he said. ``Who we take might be affected by
what else we can do in trades.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, Waddell maintained there was a ``75 percent chance''
the team would keep the selection. Any talented player at any
position would fill a need for the Thrashers, who are coming off a
season during which they lost 61 games, won 14 and were outscored
313-170 (all league worsts). Heatley is a power forward who can
score. Klesla is a physical defenseman who can move the puck and is
a strong leader. Gaborik, Waddell said, ``is the most skilled
player in the draft.'' But none likely will play in the NHL for at
least a year.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders, who won a draft lottery two weeks ago, are
central to most of the rumors. General manager Mike Milbury isn't
keeping quiet. Conversely, he's fueling every conceivable rumor.
Even Heatley noticed as much. When asked Friday whether Milbury
indicated the Islanders would select him first, Heatley said, ``He
indicated he likes a lot of guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston and Ottawa are among the teams that have had talks with
the Islanders about moving up, ostensibly to take DiPietro. Milbury
also reportedly is considering taking DiPietro if he trades young
backup Roberto Luongo, with Colorado among the possible
destinations. Waddell, also looking for a backup goalie, said
Luongo has not been offered to him.
</P>
<P>
   Ottawa has no shot at DiPietro or Heatley _ whom they
interviewed for two hours last week. In Waddell's words, ``I'll go
out on a limb and say Heatley is not going to last until the 21st
pick.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senators reportedly were dangling holdout Alexei Yashin for
a package including the Islanders' top pick. But Ottawa general
manager Marshall Johnston doused some of the trade speculation
Friday when he said a decision on whether to deal Yashin won't be
made until after an arbitrator rules on whether the talented
Russian forward is a restricted free agent.
</P>
<P>
   The Thrashers are not in the Yashin derby. But Waddell does want
to stockpile the minor-league system with 12 picks in nine rounds,
including three in the sixth and ninth Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't draft too many players at this point,'' he said.
``We're not like Detroit, where we can say, `We don't need centers
or left wingers.' We need everybody.''

LAWYER HAS SPLIT EMPLOYEES IN BIAS SUIT AGAINST COKE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)   By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   To his old friend the Rev. Jesse Jackson, Willie E. Gary is ``a
bigger-than-life character.'' Indeed, whether the topic is
compensation for a client in one of the hundreds of personal-injury
cases he has taken on, or the fine points of his private jet, a
Gulfstream II soon to be replaced by a Boeing 737, Gary is a man
who thinks in outsized proportions.
</P>
<P>
   Gary, 52, has been practicing law for the last 25 years and
presides over his own firm, housed in a baronial waterfront office
in Stuart, Fla., north of Palm Beach. Among his courtroom triumphs
was a $500 million award in 1995 for a Mississippi funeral-home
owner who sued Loewen Group. It was then the biggest verdict in
Mississippi history, and was eventually reduced to $175 million,
still a tidy sum.
</P>
<P>
   Gary is well aware of his power, stemming from dozens of similar
successes. So his sudden decision this spring to take up the cause
of black Coca-Cola employees in their racial-discrimination claims
against the company has created no small commotion, dividing the
plaintiffs by promising to win them enormous sums of money and
threatening the tentative settlement in the federal lawsuit that
was announced last week.
</P>
<P>
   For the Coke employees, some of whom had lost faith in the
original legal team, Gary's leap into the case changes the
equation. Now that a settlement is close, they must decide, once
details are made available this fall, whether to stay that course
or switch to Gary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're between a rock and a hard place,'' said Kenneth
Phillips, who was laid off in February as a computer engineer in
Coke's Atlanta headquarters. He is not a plaintiff but would be
covered by the settlement, which includes current and former
employees from 1995 to now. ``They are playing games with people's
lives,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gary promises more cash for his clients than he says the lead
lawyer, Cyrus Mehri, has asked Coke for. Mehri says he has never
discussed specifics with Gary, whose pledge helped him attract four
of the eight named plaintiffs, along with some of the 2,000 current
and former Coke employees who would be included under the
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Gary has launched a fresh offensive against
Coke. Teaming up with Johnnie Cochran, the lawyer who defended O.J.
Simpson, Gary filed a $1.5 billion lawsuit in Georgia state court
contending that a group of black women who worked at Coke were
subjected to a hostile work environment, racial harassment and
other unfair treatment.
</P>
<P>
   One woman, the complaint alleged, was told to clear away lunch
plates and ``made to feel more like a maid than a
paraprofessional.'' Another was supposedly paid $15,000 to $20,000
less than white colleagues in similar jobs.
</P>
<P>
   A Coke executive, Carl Ware, has called the Gary-Cochran lawsuit
``an 11th-hour act of blatant and disruptive legal maneuvering''
designed to derail the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gary is no stranger to the company, and his complicated
relationship with Coke is seen by many as a major factor in the
legal role he is now playing.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson introduced him to the company's former chairman and
chief executive, M. Douglas Ivester, in January _ thinking, he
recalled, that Gary could give Coke some advice on how to handle
the lawsuit. In March, Coke's marketing department completed a
major advertising deal with Gary's recently formed cable TV
channel, MBC Network.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Gary was contacted by one of the plaintiffs who was
looking for a new lawyer; Jackson had provided Gary's name.
</P>
<P>
   Gary's bid to join the federal lawsuit, on the plaintiffs' side,
was rejected by the judge. But his dealings with Coke have provoked
questions about his ability to represent Coke employees properly.
He says he will file his own lawsuits and not worry about any
class-action aspects, where the potential conflicts of interest are
particularly potent. The separate settlement from Coke, he says,
actually makes his job easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, they will have admitted their wrongdoing,'' he said
in an interview at his office in Stuart, ``and that's a hurdle I
won't have to cross.''
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, his only experience in a class-action
discrimination lawsuit has been defending a Florida sugar company
sued by West Indian cane cutters in a case that he won and that is
being appealed. In 1998 he was fined by the court for being abusive
to lawyers on the other side, trial documents show. A spokeswoman
for Gary said the order was later dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Gary traces his interest in the Coke case to his father, who
spent much of his life being underpaid as he picked string beans,
cabbage and other crops in sweltering fields across the Southeast.
Dividing the Coke plaintiffs was not his preference, he said. ``We
wanted unity in this case,'' he said. ``But sometimes, it's just
not feasible to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he had explained the details of the advertising deal
between his television channel and Coke to the four plaintiffs who
hired him. In March, the company agreed to pay several million
dollars over five years to show commercials on the MBC Network, a
family-entertainment channel targeted toward blacks in several
metropolitan areas.
</P>
<P>
   Gary recalls that he began seeking a role on the plaintiffs'
side in the Coke lawsuit in April. Then on May 9, MBC announced the
advertising deal. Newspaper reports about it came as a surprise to
most of the black employees who had met with Gary individually and
in group meetings in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   But Gary was ready with damage control. ``When he flew his staff
of attorneys in and they broke it down, then we understood,'' said
a Coke employee involved in the case. ``He is not someone that Coke
wants to see.'' Those lawyers pointed to a $5 million settlement
that he got from a Coke bottler for a toddler injured by one of its
delivery vans.
</P>
<P>
   A Coke spokesman said the company sought the advertising deal
because it wanted to reach the channel's target audience. The
channel specializes in religious, sports and entertainment
programming for black families; Gary stars on ``Spiritual Impact,''
his own talk show. ``There was no awareness on the part of the
lawyers at Coke that we were having negotiations for a media buy
with MBC,'' said the spokesman, Rob Baskin.
</P>
<P>
   Gary sees no conflict. ``If my standing up for my principles and
what I believe in is going to make them cancel the contract,'' he
said, ``then the hell with the contract.''
</P>
<P>
   He has no trouble, he said, distinguishing between Coke his
opponent in the lawsuit and Coke his business partner. ``They
allowed this to happen,'' he said, his voice rising. ``They knew it
was happening, and they didn't do anything about it. It would be a
sad day in America if they got away with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, say that Gary should avoid even the appearance
of conflict. ``It's not a matter of which he cares about more,''
said John Coffee, a professor at Columbia University Law School who
has kept a close eye on the Coke lawsuit. ``It's that the interests
overlap.''

</P>
<P>
   Mehri, the plaintiff's lawyer who represented black workers at
Texaco in a racial-discrimination case that was settled for $140
million in cash in 1996, said he was put off by Gary's whirlwind
attempt to become co-lead counsel on the federal class-action
lawsuit. ``We could not rule out the possibility of a conflict of
interest, even though we did not know the full extent of his
relationship with the company,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's relationship with Coke is also complex. The company
supports his social-action organization, Operation Rainbow/PUSH,
and the organization owns a small stake in the company. For the
last two years, Coke has been a major sponsor of the group's annual
convention, held in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Coke is also a sponsor of the Wall Street Project, a program led
by Jackson that seeks to improve investment opportunities,
including access to capital, for minorities.
</P>
<P>
   At the Coca-Cola annual meeting this year in Delaware, Jackson
delivered an impassioned oration on the lack of diversity at Coke.
But he did not endorse the boycott of Coke products called for by
the previous speaker, Larry Jones, a former employee who took a
busload of black employees from Atlanta to Wilmington.
</P>
<P>
   Jones and several others took the boycott to New York this week,
holding up placards that read ``Coke Discriminates'' as traffic
streamed past them in Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   Gary's connection to Jackson, and both men's ties to Coke, are
sources of concern to some. ``Now Willie Gary comes in, and he has
a strong tie with Jesse Jackson, yet Jesse Jackson has a strong tie
with Coke,'' Phillips said. ``It's very chaotic.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Jackson said he originally thought Gary could
serve as Coke's peacemaker. ``I thought Willie could help them
resolve the crisis,'' he said. ``They could have no doubt used his
services. He could have at least laid out for them what the options
were.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary has great rapport with juries, evoking his country roots to
stupendous effect. And he works hard at his craft. His personal
office, complete with carved stone fireplace and full bar, adjoins
a paneled miniature courtroom, in which witnesses and lawyers
rehearse their lines.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he was prepared to handle the Coke lawsuit, Gary
said he had handled all kinds of corporate litigation, including
breach of contract and discrimination. According to some Coke
employees, Gary has made convincing arguments that he can get them
a bigger award than Mehri's team.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ones who are knowledgeable about this will opt out and go
to Willie Gary,'' said one employee. ``Willie Gary has profoundly
stated that we are aiming for the sky. If it starts at $1 billion,
we'll walk away with $1 million.''
</P>
<P>
   Mehri said he has never discussed the size of the projected
settlement with Gary. ``It is not our practice to discuss
settlement strategy with any attorney who comes barreling in off
the street,'' he said. ``We never did, and we never would.''
</P>
<P>
   Mehri has some detractors as well. Concern about his
effectiveness escalated in early April after one of the plaintiffs
listened in on a conference call between several lawyers on Mehri's
team, Phillips said, and concluded that Mehri was not working in
everyone's best interests. The concerns included the amount of cash
the plaintiffs were likely to receive. Mehri's team dropped three
of the plaintiffs after deciding that they were not acting in the
best interests of the whole class.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Coke employees worry that the tentative settlement will
fall short of what they think they deserve. ``I don't want them to
go for a small amount of money for all the discrimination that has
occurred,'' said Angela Graham, one of the plaintiffs in the
lawsuit Gary filed.
</P>
<P>
   While some talk of rejecting the settlement, they also express
concern that Coke may see the split between the lawyers as a
strategic advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Gary said that would be a mistake. ``The longer they drag out
this case, the worse it's going to get,'' he said. ``It's cheaper
to do the right thing than to have to deal with a guy like Willie
Gary.''

SHAREHOLDERS APPROVE MERGER OF AOL AND TIME WARNER 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: The word AT in parentheses has been used instead of the
symbol, which is nontransmittable to many newspaper systems.) 
 By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The shareholders of both America Online and Time Warner on
Friday approved the merger of those two companies into the world's
largest media conglomerate.
</P>
<P>
   The companies nonetheless do not expect to complete their merger
until late fall, because they must still gain the approval of a
bevy of regulators, including the Federal Trade Commission, the
Federal Communications Commission, the European Union, and
municipal authorities in many cities where Time Warner owns cable
television systems.
</P>
<P>
   Both regulators and analysts say that there is little chance the
deal will not be allowed, but officials are in no hurry to approve
what would be the largest merger in corporate history, valued at
$165 billion. Indeed, the FCC is expected to hold a hearing on the
deal in late July.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is simply a process of checking off a series of boxes
between now and the fall,'' said Henry Blodget, an analyst with
Merrill Lynch. ``The shareholder vote was the biggest hurdle.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest regulatory issue relates to whether the combined
company will allow more than one high-speed Internet service to use
its cable television systems.
</P>
<P>
   Until the merger, Time Warner had planned to offer only its Road
Runner service. But the companies now pledge to allow competing
services, like the Excite(AT)Home service controlled by AT&AMP;T. The
regulators may nonetheless impose some sort of requirement for open
Internet access into their approval of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Time Warner is negotiating with providers of
high-speed Internet access to offer their services on its cable
systems. It hopes to have a few such deals completed in the next
month or two in order to show the regulators that it is acting in
good faith.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter last week, the FCC asked AOL and Time Warner about
America Online's instant messaging service and that company's
ownership of a stake in Hughes Communications, the provider of the
DirecTV satellite service, which competes with Time Warner's cable
systems.
</P>
<P>
   And in another letter released Friday, the agency asked for
documents related to business alliances by both companies,
including Time Warner's stake in Road Runner and AOL's investment
in the TiVo television recording system. Regulators and analysts
said that none of these issues is likely to ultimately present much
of a sticking point for the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union has said it would take four months to look at
the deal, but it is expected to defer to regulators in the United
States. The EU, however, may take a tougher look at Time Warner's
unrelated proposal to combine its music operation with that of EMI
Group.
</P>
<P>
   In the shareholder vote, about 99 percent of Time Warner
shareholders, meeting in New York, and 97 percent of America Online
holders, in Tyson's Corner, Va., approved the deal.
</P>
<P>
   America Online, whose stock had been soaring in the weeks before
the merger agreement was announced on Jan. 10, agreed to exchange
1.5 of its shares for each share of Time Warner. For Time Warner
shareholders that meant receiving stock in America Online worth
$110.63, 71 percent more than it was trading the day before the
deal was announced.
</P>
<P>
   Since that time, with Internet stocks of all sorts crashing,
America Online shares have fallen to $53.25, 27 percent below their
pre-deal price. Time Warner shares are at $77.56, still above their
price before the merger agreement, although the premium has fallen
to 20 percent. On Friday, Time Warner shares fell by $4 and America
Online shares dropped by $3, amid a general selloff of Internet
shares.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Case, America Online's chairman, was asked about the
decline of the company's stock in a hotel ballroom packed with more
than 500 shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happening really has less to do with AOL and less to do
with the merger and more to do with what's happening in the
sector,'' he said. ``Almost every company that we compete with,
ranging from Yahoo to Amazon to Microsoft to AT&AMP;T are down
substantially more than we are in that period.''
</P>
<P>
   As the deal works its way through Washington and Brussels,
Belgium, the managements of America Online and Time Warner are
working to create organizational and operating plans so that they
can move quickly as soon as the deal is completed. The companies
have promised Wall Street that they will cut $1 billion a year in
costs and increase their revenue by 30 percent annually, an
aggressive target for many of Time Warner's more mature businesses.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Top executives from Time Warner, including its chairman, Gerald
Levin, and vice chairman, Ted Turner, now regularly attend the
weekly management meeting held by Case. And the company has planned
a three-day management retreat in July timed to coincide with the
baseball All Star game in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Among the business issues discussed most heavily is how to
increase advertising sales at the combined company and how to sell
subscriptions to Time Warner magazines, like Time and Fortune, to
America Online users and the AOL service to Time Warner magazine
subscribers. There is continuing discussion, as at all record
labels, about how to make sense of the rise of free music on the
Internet resulting from technologies such as MP3 and Napster.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, lower-level executives at both companies have been
told not to wait until the merger is complete to find ways to work
with each other. Thus news from Time Warner's CNN now is featured
in America Online's Netcenter Web site and so on.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more difficult issues that executives at the two
companies have to discuss is the executive compensation system.
Like most technology companies, America Online has paid relatively
low cash salaries and given its executives substantial stock
options. Like most established companies, Time Warner has offered
generous salaries and more modest stock grants.
</P>
<P>
   Executives of both companies say they are working to come up
with a new system that is somewhat in the middle and that has a
measure of consistency, without requiring Time Warner executives to
all take huge cuts in salary.
</P>
<P>
   Executives of the new company will not be told about their
compensation packages until the deal is completed, executives said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, few senior executives of either company have resigned.
But Timothy Boggs, 50, Time Warner's senior vice president for
global policy, said Friday that he would resign at the beginning of
next year. In the combined company, Boggs was to have reported to
George Vradenburg III, his equivalent at America Online.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States seems to have tired of using the
fruits of American labor as a weapon in global politics. In the
span of a month, Congress eliminated China's annual trade review
and President Clinton eased economic sanctions against North Korea.
The State Department even dropped the term ``rogue state'' from its
diplomatic lexicon: Libya, Iraq and Syria are now simply ``states
of concern.''
</P>
<P>
   Could the 38-year embargo on trade with Cuba be next? There's
some real momentum building, but don't bet on a big breakthrough,
at least while Fidel Castro is still alive.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of people, including some powerful business lobbying
groups, are determined to see the embargo relaxed or eliminated
outright. But even the most modest easing, to permit sales of food
and medicine to Cuba, faces uncertain prospects in the
Republican-controlled House.
</P>
<P>
   Passage is closer than ever, if only because the bill's
Republican sponsor, George ethercutt, faces a tough re-election
fight in Washington State's farm country. But the Cuban-American
lobby is pushing for a compromise that would allow sales only for
cash on delivery _ no credit allowed. Trade rarely flourishes under
such a restriction, which is the point.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban-Americans, many of them passionately anti-Castro, make up
less than one-half of 1 percent of the population, but they are a
political law unto themselves. Cubans are concentrated in Florida,
a swing state in presidential elections, and they turn out heavily
for candidates who pledge not to compromise with Castro.
</P>
<P>
   Witness the way both Al Gore and George W. Bush opposed the
Clinton administration's decision to send Elian Gonzalez back to
Cuba with his father, defying opinion polls in the thick of the
primary campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cubans punch way above their weight in presidential politics,
and that's not changing,'' said Max Castro, a senior researcher at
the North-South Center of the University of Miami. ``The day will
come that we don't have an embargo, but I think it will have to be
chipped away bit by bit.''
</P>
<P>
   A flurry of what Charles Shapiro, head of the State Department's
Cuban Affairs Office, calls ``changes at the margins'' are already
underway. More American are visiting Cuba. Some 135,000 Americans
received official permission last year, up 10 percent from the year
before. Some, including the Yale Glee Club and the Baltimore
Orioles, flew on new direct air service to Havana from New York or
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The tourist flow is still small, but not irrelevant for the
United States hotel industry, which remembers Cuba as the leading
Caribbean destination before the Castro era. Competitors from Spain
and Canada, which do not restrict trade with Cuba, are leading a
rush to invest there while American chains must watch from 90 miles
away. Hotel groups are among a swelling anti-embargo lobby
gathering steam in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Other pro-trade groups are trying to make the case that Cuba's
11 million people are hungry for American goods. Paula Stern, the
former chairwoman of the U.S. International Trade Commission who
now heads her own trade consulting group, calculates that without
the embargo the United States could sell $444 million worth of food
and medicine a year in Cuba, generating 6,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a growing sense in the business community that if
we're going to trade with North Korea, Vietnam, Russia and some
countries in the Middle East, why aren't we trading with Cuba?''
said Thomas Donohue, who heads the United States Chamber of
Commerce. ``People are asking fundamental questions about a policy
that's clearly illogical.''
</P>
<P>
   But Congress is listening with just one ear, at least so far.
The Senate seems not to want to even study the matter: last week it
voted 59 to 41 against creating a special commission to research
the effectiveness of the Cuba embargo.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is that Cuba upends the usual political
order in Washington. Democrats, usually skeptical of free trade,
generally want to lift the embargo, while ordinarily trade-friendly
Republicans tend to want to retain it.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Birns, a Cuba expert at the Council on Hemispheric Affairs
in Washington, said that when the embargo finally goes, 2000 will
be seen as the watershed. The Gonzalez case exposed the anti-Castro
lobby as fanatical, a label that will be hard to shake, Birns said.
</P>
<P>
   But he thinks the political calculus still does not favor
dramatic action on the embargo, and certainly not in an election
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can accuse people of hypocrisy and double standards all
you want,'' he said. ``But they're not going to do anything about
it until they see a political advantage.''

 &HT;    Atlanta Ballet, Indigo Girls to collaborate
 &HT;    By Wendell Brock
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Atlanta Ballet has engaged the Indigo Girls to
collaborate next season on a world premiere in which the
Atlanta-based pop singers will perform original music with the
company at the Fox Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   The ballet has not chosen a choreographer for the March 15-18
production, but artistic director John McFall says he wants to
bring in a woman choreographer to work with the perennially popular
lesbian duo of Emily Saliers and Amy Ray. ``I think there's a
simpatico there that you can only achieve by taking that route,''
McFall said Friday, in announcing the lineup for the 2000-2001
season.
</P>
<P>
   The Indigo Girls are in the midst of a national tour and could
not be reached for comment, but McFall said they would write at
least two new songs for the 25-minute work. On the same ticket will
be a world premiere by Laura Dean (``Earth'') and a company
premiere by Australian choreographer Stanton Welch (``Garden of
Mirth'').
</P>
<P>
   At a time when dance can be a hard sell, the Indigo Girls
collaboration should broaden the ballet's audience and boost its
box office.

CLINTON GETS TIPS ON POLE VAULTING, RACE WALKING FROM U.S.
OLYMPIANS 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARC LACEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHULA VISTA, Calif. _ President Clinton saluted American
athletes at an Olympic training center here Friday and received
some expert instruction in pole vaulting, race walking and archery.
</P>
<P>
   Under a hot California sun, Chad Smith, who hopes to represent
the United States in the decathlon at the Olympic Games this fall,
showed Clinton how he hoisted himself up in the pole vault. Andrew
Hermann, a champion race walker, taught the leader of the free
world how to gyrate his hips and swing his arms while gliding along
the track. Two archers, Vic Wonderly and Rod White, demonstrated
how to shoot Olympic bull's-eyes.
</P>
<P>
   The president, who gave up jogging after he injured a knee,
watched carefully, questioned the athletes intently, but, much to
the relief of his aides, declined to put his newly found knowledge
to use.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did, however, salute the athletes preparing for the
Games this fall in Sydney, Australia, and announced initiatives he
said he hoped would encourage more Americans to break into a sweat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people like the Olympics, in large measure, because
the Olympics work pretty much the way we think life ought to
work,'' the president said. ``Everybody gets an opportunity to play
_ and regardless of race or station in life _ and increasingly,
thank goodness, regardless of gender.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he has directed the departments of Education and
Health and Human Services to formulate measures to encourage more
children to become more physically fit. From 1991 to 1999, the
percentage of high school students in daily gym classes declined
from 42 percent to 29 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
   During Clinton's tour of the 150-acre training center here, one
of three such facilities in the United States, the president saw
athletes honing their skills for the upcoming Games, and others
still competing for membership on the U.S. team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want you to win all the medals you can,'' Clinton told
several hundred athletes who took a break from their routines to
hear him. ``But I want you to realize that by what you have
accomplished already, and by the way you have done it, you have
already made your country very proud.''
</P>
<P>
   The president said he was particularly impressed with the
marathon runner Christine Clark, who is 37 and began running only
five years ago but who has been selected for the Olympic squad.
</P>
<P>
   He also singled out Deena Drossin, who is competing for a place
on the track and field team. During a championship race in
Portugal, she was stung by a bee in her throat. She blacked out in
the middle of the race but managed to get up and continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``She gave new meaning to the term `making a beeline,''' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   The president said that he would not attend the Games this fall
and that Hillary Rodham Clinton would be occupied with ``a
competition of her own.'' But Clinton said his daughter, Chelsea,
was planning to attend to cheer for America's athletes.

<P>
   Conventional wisdom says the music industry is under siege,
threatened by Napster and MP3 and digital piracy.
</P>
<P>
   In the none-too-distant future, techno-visionaries declare,
musicians will not need record labels. Instead, they will market
and sell recordings directly to fans over the Internet. Even the
labels that manage to hang on to their artists will find their
sales eviscerated by piracy. With free music available on the Web
via Napster and other song-trading services, only fools will pay
for songs.
</P>
<P>
   That's the conventional wisdom. Why, then, did the French
conglomerate Vivendi agree last week to pay $34 billion in stock
for Seagram, whose Universal Music division is the world leader?
And why did Jean-Marie Messier, Vivendi's chairman, describe music
as the most important element of the deal? Or, as one music
industry executive put it in language too colorful to quote
directly: If things are so bad, how come we're selling so many
records?
</P>
<P>
   Good questions all. In their rush to mock the Vivendi-Universal
deal _ and to write off Bertelsmann, Sony, Time Warner and EMI,
which with Universal dominate the $40 billion music industry
worldwide _ fans of Napster, MP3 and other upstart technologies are
ignoring the fact that the music industry is booming, perhaps a
more powerful force in pop culture than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, sales of albums, as the industry
anachronistically calls full-length CD's and cassettes, are up
about 8 percent, to 312 million through mid-June, according to
Soundscan, which tracks such things. Albums released this year by
Eminem, Britney Spears and 'N Sync had the three fastest-selling
debuts in the history of the music industry. Eminem records for
Interscope, which is owned by Universal, while Britney Spears and
'N Sync are on Jive Records, which is partially owned and
distributed by BMG.
</P>
<P>
   Shipments of CD's are almost certain to top one billion this
year for the first time, up from 940 million last year, according
to the Recording Industry Association of America, a trade group.
Over all, the industry is on track to ship more than $15 billion in
CD's, DVD's, and even vinyl albums this year _ double the level of
a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   That strength comes in the face of the explosive growth of
Napster, a free service that allows anyone connected to the
Internet to trade songs with anyone else registered with the
service. In the 18 months since it was created by Shawn Fanning,
then 19 and a Northeastern University student looking for a way to
share music files, Napster has registered more than 13 million
users _ without any paid advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, it has become a cultural phenomenon, the subject
of magazine cover articles and ominous news reports. ``Like
techno-termites, computer users who swap free recordings are
gnawing at the foundations of the music industry,'' The Wall Street
Journal intoned on Tuesday, laying the blame for ``a piracy
plague'' squarely on Napster.
</P>
<P>
   The recording industry is indeed concerned about Napster. Its
new mechanism for distributing songs _ both convenient and free _
has proved its attractiveness, especially for the young people who
are the most avid music consumers.
</P>
<P>
   In a lawsuit scheduled to be heard next month, the industry
contends that the service contributes to copyright infringement.
Napster disputes the accusation that its technology hurts record
companies, arguing that it gives consumers a way to sample songs
before buying albums.
</P>
<P>
   Recent rulings in other cases have gone the industry's way, and
the music companies say they can create an equally convenient
digital system that protects their property rights, though so far
they have not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Napster's growth indicates demand for music digitally, not
demand for Napster,'' said Dave Goldberg, chairman of Launch Media,
a company that has partnered with traditional labels to offer songs
and music videos over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The focus on Napster and its Internet ilk ignores the
established music industry's real strengths _ and the reasons that
companies like Vivendi and America Online are buying into the
business, Goldberg and others say.
</P>
<P>
   The companies are not paying billions for the opportunity to
truck CD's to retailers. Rather, like movie studios _ to which most
of the big record companies are attached _ they are first and
foremost in the promotion and marketing business.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States alone, there are hundreds of thousands of
bands with enough original material for full-length CD's. MP3.com,
which operates an Internet site where bands can post music free,
had 74,000 artists and 469,000 songs available for download at the
end of May.
</P>
<P>
   Yet at any given moment, only a few dozen musicians occupy the
public's attention, generating the kind of radio play, record sales
and adulation that generations of garage bands have dreamed about.
The others are just background noise.
</P>
<P>
   And it is the background noise _ or at least the kind of music
little heard outside college quads _ in which the upstarts
specialize. From December to March, the number of bands on the
MP3.com site rose to 63,000 from 45,000. But the number of CD's
sold on the site during that time was stuck, at about 26,000 a
month. (MP3.com stopped reporting its CD sales after March.) Put
another way, consumers bought more copies of the new Britney Spears
album on the day it was released than they have ever bought at
MP3.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``The record industry so far has a lock on almost all the
marketable talent out there,'' said Ron Rodrigues, editor in chief
of Radio &AMP; Records, a Los Angeles newspaper that covers the music
industry. ``There hasn't been an entrepreneur as of yet who's been
able to skirt the recording industry as we know it and make money
outside the system. The whole front end of the process by which the
record gets marketed and played hasn't changed yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it likely to anytime soon. The keys, now more than ever,
are money and size.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   After a decade of consolidation, the radio industry has two
giant gatekeepers, Clear Channel Communications and Viacom's
Infinity Broadcasting, which each control hundreds of stations
across the country. Viacom also owns MTV _ if anything even more
important than radio to the success of a new album. Both companies
carefully build their stations' playlists _ making it difficult for
an unknown band or song to become a hit in one market and spread to
others.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the heightened power of the record labels, which
themselves have consolidated into a few giant corporate hydras. The
labels' clout is crucial to getting new bands broadcast exposure,
the fuel that drives sales. Labels trade promotional appearances by
successful, established bands for air time for new bands. They pay
to sponsor concerts with local radio stations, a practice that some
critics say skirts close to payola, the illegal act of paying to
have a song played. They advertise everywhere from Rolling Stone
magazine to posters on construction sites.
</P>
<P>
   Without all that, it is nearly impossible for a band to break
through the clutter, said Michael Nathanson, who follows the music
industry for Sanford C. Bernstein, the securities firm. Nathanson
said that even Warner Music and EMI had struggled recently to get
some new artists' songs on the air because BMG and Universal have
been so dominant for the last year _ though Nathanson does not
expect that situation to last.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to promotion and marketing, labels put up the cash
advances that artists use to record their albums, and they offer
creative advice, for better or worse. Sometimes the labels go a
step further, actually creating bands with a sound and look they
think will resonate.
</P>
<P>
   Critics who say Napster and MP3.com will destroy the labels
``have misunderstood the business of music,'' said Paul Vidich,
executive vice president of Warner Music.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of performers, like Courtney Love, have protested the
labels' dominance, but record executives say the current system
works for most musicians, who lack the time or money to promote and
market an album.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think artists are in the position of being risk-takers
like that,'' Vidich said. ``They would rather get a big advance.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, upstarts like MP3.com, which boldly declared last year
that it would take power from established labels by offering bands
higher royalty payments and direct access to consumers, seem to be
recognizing that their role may simply be to push the industry to
embrace new means of distribution and promotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no desire to put the labels out of business,'' said
Hank Barry, Napster chief executive. ``We believe that this advance
in technology will increase interest in music.''
</P>
<P>
   The labels, after years of dragging their heels on digital
distribution, seem finally to agree. Before the year is out,
Universal plans to sell digital music over the Internet;
eventually, Messier hopes to link the service to his budding
cell-phone empire. Similarly, AOL is likely to explore way to
electronically distribute music _ including Warner's _ to its
customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somewhere along the line, we thought the album was created by
God and forgot it is not the only way that music is packaged and
sold,'' said Jay A. Samit, EMI Music's senior vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Still, exactly how music will be sold in the future remains an
open question. Goldberg favors subscription services that will
allow users to hear as much music as they want, commercial free,
for a fee of $15 or so a month. If the record industry could
convince the 100 million Americans considered to be active music
consumers to sign up for a subscription service, it would have
annual revenue of $18 billion, slightly more than current annual
record sales, he said. He also expects advertising-supported
Internet radio services to become more popular.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Vidich said he thinks subscription services
are unlikely to catch on as long as free, ad-supported radio is
available. He says digital downloads of individual albums will more
likely be popular _ as will traditional CD's.
</P>
<P>
   ``People do like CD's'' he said. ``They continue to buy about
900 million CD's every year in this country. I don't think people
are going to change their behavior dramatically. They're going to
continue to do what they've done, and they're going to do new
things.''

 &HT;    You'll be flip for the ride, courtesy of a bottlenose dolphin,
and the mammal-to-mammal bonding at Orlando's new Discovery Cove
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, June 25.
 &HT;    By Doug Hamilton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO _ My dolphin has gone limp.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was for me to grab her dorsal fin with both hands and
hitch a ride as she swam directly to trainer Carrie Nelson,
stationed on a rock outcropping about 25 feet to the left. But
halfway there, Natalie _ a 5-year-old, 340-pound Atlantic
bottlenose _ has veered off course and glided to a halt. For a few
seconds she is inert in the saltwater lagoon, droopy at both ends _
a slick, slack arc of indecision.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe she caught sight of another trainer, looking on from the
far edge of the palm-ringed pool, and got confused. Maybe she was
distracted by the other dolphins. Far more likely though, at least
to my mind, is that she's annoyed by the flailing, hapless human
she's dragging behind her, who can't seem to get a proper grip on
her fin to save his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's try again!'' bellows Paul Komkanski, treading water next
to me. Komkanski and Nelson are two of four wildly enthusiastic
trainers guiding me and several others through a preview of the
dolphin-swim experience at Discovery Cove. Just across the way from
sister attraction Sea World Orlando, the 30-acre, interactive
marine park is Central Florida's latest bid for your tourist
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Guests of Discovery Cove, which opens Saturday, can snorkel
among stingrays and puffer fish in a coral reef (where you can also
spy sharks behind glass); float under waterfalls and through an
aviary on a 3,300-foot ``lazy river''; or they can just bask in the
baking Florida sun on the man-made beach.
</P>
<P>
   But the 800-pound gorilla, as it were, is the dolphin swim. The
90-minute session, including a 45-minute pre-swim presentation on
dolphin anatomy and habits, isn't the only attraction of its kind.
There are similar programs at the Seaquarium in Miami, in the
Florida Keys and at various oceanside resorts in the Caribbean. But
it's a convenient destination for landlocked Atlantans longing for
a more tactile encounter with marine life than they can get at the
local tropical fish store.
</P>
<P>
   It's a pricey ride: $179 plus tax, $89 if you opt out of the
dolphin swim, though that's akin to visiting Zoo Atlanta and not
seeing the pandas. You also get a buffet-style meal _ including,
oddly, some seafood entrees _ and passes to Sea World Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   The wallet-hoovering admission doesn't seem to be deterring
visitors; July and August are virtual advance sell-out-- . (The
reservations-only park limits attendance to slightly less than
1,000 guests per day.)
</P>
<P>
   Those willing to pay the top ticket price are in for an
intensely hands-on _ and occasionally lips-on _ experience.
</P>
<P>
   My swim begins with a kiss from Griffith, one of 28 dolphins
that Discovery Cove, er, employs. Another female Atlantic
bottlenose, Griffith poses for photo ops with guests when they
first enter the pool. Heeding the trainers' warning to approach her
straight on and not from above _ lest she jerk her head up while
we're engaged _ I gingerly buss her nose, or rostrum. It's wet and
rubbery, like smooching the toe of a rain boot. But it's not the
worst kiss I've ever had.
</P>
<P>
   Next I meet C.J., a 7-year-old Atlantic bottlenose/common
dolphin mix, and I stroke his soft white belly, which I'm told he
likes. Forty minutes later, I'll end the swim with a quick,
whooshing ride on Capricorn, Natalie's 35-year-old, 700-pound papa.
</P>
<P>
   Before that, though, Natalie and I dance our skittish pas de
deux.
</P>
<P>
   According to the trainers, we're meant to establish
``relationships'' with the dolphins. ``Training is basically
building trust,'' Komkanski coaches. And like most first dates,
it's taking a while for Natalie and I to get comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   She circles the pool and comes back for another pass at the
tandem swim. Komkanski beckons me into position and I grasp her fin
again. ``She's just learning to do this, so you're actually helping
us train her,'' he continues in his rah-rah, howdy-campers tone.
``And remember, we don't make the dolphins do anything they don't
want to, so if she's here with you, it means she wants to be.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm skeptical: If I were a dolphin, would I rather be toting
around a pasty guy in a too-tight wet suit vest, or hanging with
the other dolphins, munching on herring?
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Komkanski's pep talk gives me a little more
confidence as I take hold. This trip goes better _ Natalie makes a
beeline for Nelson and I manage to hang on for nearly two-thirds of
the way.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson throws her a few finger-size fish and she wiggles away.
Our brief encounter at an end, I paddle over to attempt to build a
relationship with Capricorn, a veteran of countless Sea World
shows.
</P>
<P>
   He waits with the imperturbability of an old war horse as I grab
his tattered dorsal fin and pectoral flipper. A few quick pumps of
his massive tail and we're at the shore. Exhilarated, I disengage
and he swims off to claim his herring bounty. Godspeed, soldier.
</P>
<P>
   As I slosh onto the shore, still giddy from my aquatic
communion, a question lingers. How do the dolphins feel? Is this
just a one-sided romance?
</P>
<P>
   That's open to debate. Many animal rights advocates maintain
that dolphins suffer in such programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're opposed to dolphin captivity in general,'' says Lisa
Lange, a spokeswoman for the People for the Ethical Treatment of
Animals. ``And swim-with programs are the worst, because not only
are these intelligent, sensitive animals confined to what to them
is the equivalent of a bathtub, but they have to lug lazy tourists
around.''
</P>
<P>
   Discovery Cove officials assert that the animals benefit from
the stimulation of human contact. And besides, counters former
trainer Julie Scardina, ``there's no dolphin environment today
that's not affected by man. There's habitat destruction, pollution,
hunting, overfishing of their resources, all kinds of dangers. I'd
rather take care of the animals and know that they have a great,
safe place to live.'' (Scardina, who acts as ``animal ambassador''
for Sea World and Discovery Cove, takes critters on public
appearances, including occasional spots on ``The Tonight Show With
Jay Leno.'')
</P>
<P>
   As for this lazy tourist, I believe that no dolphins were harmed
during the researching of this story. And I'm grateful for their
time and patience. I can now say that I've connected, lips to
rostrum, hand to fin, with some of the Earth's most accommodating
creatures.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and a special thanks to Natalie, who really knows how to
give a guy a lift.
</P>

TEXAS MURDER CASE MAY PUT DEATH PENALTY SPOTLIGHT ON CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Texas, Iowa, S.C., Md., Pa., Ala., Mo., Va., Okla.,
Ind., Calif., Wis.)   By RAYMOND BONNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the nation's attention drawn to recent
executions, the focus has been largely on the states, primarily
Illinois, whose governor has declared a moratorium, and Texas,
which puts more men and women to death than most countries and
whose governor, of course, is running for president.
</P>
<P>
   This has allowed the Clinton administration to remain largely
above the fray because there has not been a federal execution in
nearly 40 years. Although Vice President Al Gore favors the death
penalty, he has not faced the tough questioning that Gov. George W.
Bush has, and Gore has said little other than that he does not see
the need for a federal moratorium.
</P>
<P>
   But the case of a condemned migrant worker may soon call
attention to the federal capital punishment system.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Raul Garza, a migrant farm worker and high school dropout
who was convicted seven years ago of marijuana smuggling and three
drug-related murders in Brownsville, Texas, is scheduled to be
executed on Aug. 5. It would be the first federal execution since
John F. Kennedy was president, when a man was put to death by
hanging in Iowa, for kidnapping and murder.
</P>
<P>
   The Garza case raises broad, and for many, troubling issues
about the application of the federal death penalty, most
specifically, whether race and geography determine who is sentenced
to die at the hands of the U.S. government. Seventeen of the 21
federal death row inmates are minorities, and federal prosecutors
in a dozen Southern states account for more than half of the
federal cases in which the death penalty is sought.
</P>
<P>
   Garza's lawyers have exhausted legal appeals, and are turning to
the court of public opinion and politics. They have enlisted the
American Bar Association, which in a highly unusual move last
month, called on President Clinton to declare a moratorium on
federal executions.
</P>
<P>
   Garza wants to ask the president for clemency. But his lawyers
said they are facing some formidable handicaps.
</P>
<P>
   To begin with, there are no guidelines for filing a clemency
petition in a federal capital case.
</P>
<P>
   The president's power to grant clemency, be it reprieve,
commutation or pardon, is found in Article II of the Constitution.
It cannot be limited by Congress or the courts, which means the
president can grant clemency whenever he thinks the sentence is
unjust, mercy dictates or in the name of the public tranquility.
</P>
<P>
   The first step in the process is for the prisoner to file a
request with the pardon attorney of the Justice Department, who
then makes a recommendation to the president. That office has
adopted regulations and forms for inmates to use, but these apply
to noncapital cases.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said in February that the department was drafting
regulations for capital cases; a department official said Friday
that they were not yet finished. Garza's lawyers are waiting for
these in order to avoid filing a petition that is thrown out for
failing to follow procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really between a rock and a hard place,'' said Gregory
Wiercioch, a lawyer with the Texas Defender Service, who has been
representing Garza in his appeals. ``A lot of the information we
want to put in the petition, we don't have. It's in the hands of
the government.''
</P>
<P>
   This includes a study on whether race is a factor in applying
the death penalty in federal cases. The Justice Department has
turned down Garza's request for the study or the raw data that the
department has gathered. A department spokesman said the study has
not been completed and the data would not be made public.
</P>
<P>
   Garza's lawyers have also requested information on how the the
Justice Department has handled other capital cases. There are a
dozen cases like Garza's _ multiple drug-related murders _ in which
federal prosecutors did not seek the death penalty, including six
in New York, Wiercioch said. He wants to know why the death penalty
was sought in Garza's case and believes that race was a factor. Of
the 27 defendants against whom the Bush administration sought the
death penalty for drug-related killings, including Garza, 23 were
African-American or Hispanic, Wiercioch said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, when Congress was considering sweeping death penalty
legislation, Attorney General Janet Reno said in a letter to a
congressman who opposed the death penalty that the department was
developing procedures that would allow for the disclosure of its
capital prosecution decisions ``so that the public can review and
understand the basis for such decisions.'' A Justice Department
official said this week that the procedures have not yet been
adopted.
</P>
<P>
   After the Supreme Court declared in 1972 that the death penalty,
as it was then being applied, was unconstitutional, states quickly
adopted laws that the court upheld. But Congress spent the next 16
years struggling to find a way around the court's concerns. In
1988, Congress adopted what has become known as the ``drug kingpin
statute,'' which allows for the death penalty against an individual
who commits murder as part of a larger drug enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Six years later, in 1994, Congress enacted the Federal Death
Penalty Act, which expanded the crimes for which a defendant could
be executed. They include the assassination of the president,
large-scale drug trafficking even when no one is killed, drive-by
killings, sexual abuse resulting in death and destruction of a
plane, train or motor vehicle resulting in death.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law requires the appointment of two lawyers for an
indigent defendant facing the death penalty, at least one of whom
must be experienced in capital cases. As a result, claims of
ineffective assistance of counsel do not mark the federal system,
as they do many states, such as Texas, where defendants have been
represented by lawyers who have slept through trials, or have
otherwise displayed gross incompetence.
</P>
<P>
   The principal concerns about the federal death penalty are
whether it is being applied fairly and uniformly.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Since 1988, the Justice Department has allowed the death penalty
to be sought against 199 defendants, according to the Federal Death
Penalty Resource Counsel in Columbia, S.C. Seventy-six percent of
those defendants are minorities, and 52 percent are
African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 21 federal inmates currently on death row _ including
Timothy McVeigh, who was convicted in the Oklahoma City bombings _
about 62 percent, or 13 are African-Americans. This is a greater
percentage of blacks on death row than in all but four states:
Maryland, Louisiana, Illinois and Pennsylvania. In Texas, by
contrast, 41 percent of the death row population is black, and in
Alabama, 46 percent, according to the Death Penalty Information
Center, a private organization in Washington that opposes the death
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``If some back county in the South had the same kind of numbers,
the Department of Justice would be down here investigating, handing
out indictments,'' Wiercioch said.

 &HT;    Odds for Elian to stay slim
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The likelihood of Elian Gonzalez' return to his Cuban
homeland increased substantially Friday when the federal appeals
court in Atlanta declined to reconsider the international custody
battle.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-year-old boy's Miami relatives said they will appeal to
the U.S. Supreme Court, but the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
ruling gives them a tight deadline.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court, in a five-page ruling issued Friday, said all
legal restraints keeping Juan Miguel Gonzalez from taking his son
back to Cuba will be lifted at 4 p.m. Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court said it will not _ with ``NOT'' written in
large, boldfaced letters _ extend the Wednesday deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, a three-judge 11th Circuit panel ruled that
the Immigration and Naturalization Service was within its right to
deny an asylum hearing for the young shipwreck survivor.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's Miami relatives, who want the boy to become a U.S.
citizen, asked the full court to reconsider the panel's decision.
For that to happen, seven of the court's 12 judges must agree.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Miguel is ``grateful'' for the court's ruling and eager to
take his son home, said his Washington lawyer, Gregory Craig.
</P>
<P>
   But Armando Gutierrez, a spokesman for the Miami family, said
they believe ``this historic case'' deserves consideration by the
Supreme Court, and will file an appeal Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're still fighting for what his mother wanted and lost her
life for,'' he said. ``They're not going to give up hope. They hope
he will still be here for the 4th of July celebration.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian's mother and 10 others drowned when their boat sank
fleeing communist Cuba to the United States. Elian was rescued off
the Florida coast Thanksgiving Day.
</P>
<P>
   The odds of the Supreme Court taking Elian's appeal appear slim.
More than 8,000 petitions a year are filed before the court; last
year, it accepted fewer than 100.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the court's nine justices would have to agree to hear
the case. Justice Anthony Kennedy, the member of the Supreme Court
assigned to the 11th Circuit, probably will make the initial
decision on whether the injunction keeping Elian in the United
States should remain in effect.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration lawyers who have followed Elian's case predict such
a ruling is unlikely. ``I'd say the odds of the Supreme Court
taking this case are very low,'' Atlanta lawyer Dale Schwartz said.
``It appears very likely that Juan Miguel will soon be able to take
his son back home.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Atlanta attorney Socheat Chea: ``I think the decision by
the panel pretty much sealed the fate of Elian's return to Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian has been staying with his father, stepmother and his
half-brother in the Washington area since April, awaiting the
resolution of the legal maneuvers.

 &HT;    Footprints in the sand: Uncovering the mystery of Namibia
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, June 25.
 &HT;    By Keith Hadley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Namibia is a vast country of bounteous beauty and abundant
sunshine on the southwest coast of Africa. It takes its name from
the Namib Desert, a place of haunting landscapes that runs the
entire length of Namibia's South Atlantic coast. Here, the
apricot-colored dunes are said to be among the largest on earth.
</P>
<P>
   The Namib is where ``the desert kisses the sea,'' says Atlanta
Journal-Constitution photographer Keith Hadley, 43, who recently
visited and profusely photographed Namibia.
</P>
<P>
   With his wife, Charmaine (making tracks in the sand in his photo
at right), Hadley toured with a group of 14 other African-Americans
who live all over the country, from Alabama to California. None had
ever visited Namibia.
</P>
<P>
   Hadley did advance research, but because Namibia is just
developing as a tourist destination, he felt he would be
``discovering a mysterious, uncharted territory.''
</P>
<P>
   With his camera, he did.
</P>
<P>
   Namibia was annexed by Germany in 1885 and administered by South
Africa until gaining its independence in 1990. It's one of the
larger countries in Africa, yet with a population density among the
world's lowest (1.6 million people occupying 318,216 square miles).
The openness, accentuated by wide horizons and clear skies, made
for some wonderful photo opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Hadley describes his trip as ``a humbling experience'' that had
him thinking of forebears who were forced from Africa as slaves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many African-Americans want to go back to the motherland as a
`Roots' thing,'' says Hadley, who visited Africa for the first time
three years ago, satisfying a longtime ``burning desire,'' and has
returned every year since. ``They left in shackles, and here we
were coming back as editors and doctors and lawyers. We felt
fortunate, because when you go back, there are millions of people
who have struggled because of what colonialism has done to the
continent.''
</P>
<P>
   As for photographing in Namibia, Hadley says, ``The only real
challenge I experienced was keeping sand out of my camera.''

 WASHINGTON: Wiercioch said. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an interview last week, Gore said, ``The question of racial
disparity is right now being investigated thoroughly within the
Justice Department.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that the factors that led Columbia University
researchers to raise questions about the death penalty in a recent
study, such as prosecutorial misconduct and incompetent defense
counsel ``are the kinds of mistakes that could conceivably have a
connection to racial attitudes in the aggregate.''
</P>
<P>
   In his letter to Clinton on May 2 calling for a federal
moratorium, the president of the American Bar Association, William
G. Paul of Oklahoma City, urged a ``comprehensive examination of
the federal death penalty that would not be limited to the question
of racial discrimination.'' The bar association has not taken a
position for or against the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   There are glaring geographic disparities in the application of
the federal death penalty law.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen of the 21 defendants on federal death row, in Terre
Haute, Ind., are from three states _ Texas, six; Virginia, four;
and Missouri, four.
</P>
<P>
   Under a system put in place by Reno, U.S. attorneys who file
charges in which the death penalty is a possibility are required to
send a memorandum to the Justice Department for review by a
four-member committee, the Capital Case Review Committee. The
system is intended to ensure uniformity and fairness in the
application of the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, from 1994 to 1999, one-third of the U.S. attorney's offices
did not file a capital prosecution request, a former member of the
review committee, Rory K. Little, wrote in an article in the
Fordham Urban Law Journal in March 1999.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Little noted that federal prosecutors have considerable
discretion but he said this suggested that the federal death
penalty was not being applied uniformly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is difficult to believe that not a single murder in those
11 states since 1994 was a possible candidate for federal
prosecution,'' Little wrote in the article, ``The Federal Death
Penalty: History and Some Thoughts About the Department of
Justice's Role.'' He went on: ``There are, sadly, gang-related
killings in every urban center in America and drug-related killings
occur not only in Miami, but also in urban centers such as New
York, San Francisco, Chicago and Seattle.''
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Little, a former federal prosecutor
who is now a professor of criminal law and legal ethics at Hastings
College of Law in San Francisco, said he was not an ``emotional
opponent'' of the death penalty, but that he had ``grave
misgivings'' about the way it is administered by the states.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; On the federal level, he said, further study was needed before
a judgment could be made. He added: ``In my view, it isn't fair
that if somebody who commits a bank robbery and a guard dies is
going to get the death penalty if it happened in Texas, but someone
who does the same thing in Massachusetts isn't.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   He said he was aware of a case in Missouri that was very similar
to Garza's in which the government did not seek the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Garza was accused of being a major drug dealer and convicted of
smuggling more than 1,000 kilos of marijuana from Mexico between
1982 and 1992, as well as of three murders.
</P>
<P>
   At the punishment phase of Garza's trial, prosecutors introduced
testimony that Garza committed four murders in Mexico. But he had
never been prosecuted for the murders.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the history of the modern death penalty, we are unaware of
any case where prosecutors introduce evidence of unadjudicated
foreign crimes at the penalty phase,'' said Bruce W. Gilchrist, a
lawyer with Hogan &AMP; Hartson, which has joined Garza's defense team
pro bono.
</P>
<P>
   Federal courts have rejected the claim that this testimony
violated Garza's constitutional protections. But the Inter-American
Commission on Human Rights, a body of the Organization of American
States, is investigating whether it violated the American
Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man, which the United
States has signed.
</P>
<P>
   Pending the outcome of that investigation, the organization has
called on the Clinton administration to delay Garza's execution.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wis., sent a letter to the
president and Reno asking them to suspend federal executions, and
he has introduced legislation calling for a national moratorium on
the death penalty.

 &HT;    Part theme park, part museum, hip architect Frank Gehry's paean
to rock 'n' roll erupts in funky, colorful chaos
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, June 25
 &HT;    By Catherine Fox
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Architecture is ordinarily a noun. Applied to Frank
Gehry's mind-bending design for the Experience Music Project, it is
definitely a verb. The exterior of the interactive rock 'n' roll
museum, which opened this weekend, bulges, arches, flares, ripples,
crumples, careens and caroms.
</P>
<P>
   The 140,000-square-foot metal-skinned building appears to be in
a state of becoming. It has no definite front, back or sides, no
distinction between wall and roof. Its six interlocking, amoeboid
forms reveal no straight lines, and there are no words with which
to name its shapes.
</P>
<P>
   No shrinking violet, the EMP actually blazes with color _
fire-engine red, baby blue, purple haze, chrome and bronze.
</P>
<P>
   This architecture is imaginative. Dynamic. Forceful. But not
beautiful. While they have their lyrical moments, the individual
shapes are more often ungainly. The baby blue hits the wrong note.
The strips of blue and green glass that snake along the roof are
gratuitous. The 206-feet-long behemoth is, well, weird.
</P>
<P>
   Its site _ at the edge of the Seattle Center, the grounds of the
1962 World's Fair _ doesn't help. The EMP is parked at the foot of
the Jetson-esque Space Needle, across the street from the squat
Polly Esther nightclub and in front of the Fun Forest, the kiddie
amusement park whose garish colors and swooping forms might have
been an inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   So, you were expecting another Bilbao? Gehry's transcendently
elegant Guggenheim Museum, which hugs the Nervion River in the
Basque region of Spain, is, you will recall, widely considered one
of the most original buildings of the 20th century. It catapulted
the California architect to the top of his profession.
</P>
<P>
   But then, this istemplation. The Experience Music Project is a
valentine to musical creativity that delights in overstimulation.
With the city's monorail zipping between two of the forms and a
motion-simulated ride one of the exhibits inside, it's closer to a
theme park than a museum.
</P>
<P>
   For this project, Gehry, seems to favor exuberance over
aesthetic finesse, a strategy that works to a point. Brash and
confrontational, the $100 million structure captures the spirit of
its subject. Seattle critic John Pastier aptly describes it as ``an
improvisatory riff frozen in midnote.''
</P>
<P>
   Gehry, 71, is a classical music fan. Patrons Paul G. Allen,
Microsoft mogul and Jimi Hendrix fan, and his sister, Jody Allen
Patton, chose him to design their museum because his relationship
to his own profession mirrors that of rock innovators. Today's
``it'' arcaces, his presence is there. The exterior colors and
materials and jutting shapes find their way inside, even into the
exhibit design, revving up an already high-key experience even
more.
</P>
<P>
   Like it or hate it, one thing is undeniable. The Experience
Music Project is always the Experience Architecture Project as
well.
</P>
<P>
   The Experience Music Project
</P>
<P>
   9 a.m.-11 p.m. daily. Seattle Center, Fifth Avenue North and
Broad Street, Seattle. $14.95-$19.95. Tickets available through
Ticketmaster. 206-770-2700.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Not famed architect Frank Gehry's most successful
effort but an imaginative homage to the rambunctious spirit of rock
'n' roll.

 &HT;    Made in the shade: Get golden with self-tanners
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, June 25
 &HT;    By Marylin Johnson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you want to practice ``safe sun,'' make certain your tan
comes out of a bottle.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the telltale orangy streaks of self-tanners in the past,
today's sunless products are effective, fast and a smart way to
achieve a natural-looking faux glow.
</P>
<P>
   ``We highly recommend self-tanners to our patients, since they
do not pose any risk to the skin,'' says Dr. Jean Kois, a
dermatologist in the office of Georgia Dermatology Specialists.
</P>
<P>
   Self-tanners, she adds, ``are not absorbed into the skin. The
active ingredient is the chemical DHA (dihydroxyacaetone). It only
binds with the top, dead layers of the skin, causing it to stain
the skin a brownish color.'' The intensity of color depends on the
amount of DHA, usually from 3.5 to about 5 percent.
</P>

   However, Kois cautions that although self-tanners provide you
with a tan, they do not protect you from the sun. ``You still need
to wear a sunscreen with an SPF of 30,'' she says. Sunless products
are available in sprays and gels, lotions and creams and come in a
wide range of prices. Examples: Avon Sunless Tanning Cream SPF 8
($9.50); Clarins Self Tanning Milk SPF 6 ($23.50); Clinique Face
Quick Bronze Tinted Self-Tanner ($14.50); Estee Lauder's Go Bronze
Tinted Self-Tanner for Body ($25); Hawaiian Tropic Self-Tanning
Foam ($7.99); L'Oreal Suncare Ombrelle Sunless Spray SPF 12
($8.99); Merle Norman's Sun Free Self Tanning Creme ($12.50);
Neutrogena Instant Bronze Tinted Sunless Tanner for the face
($8.45); and Neutrogena Sunless Tanning Foam ($8.45).
</P>
<P>
   Some tanners do contain sunscreens and moisturizers, so read
labels carefully. ``Also, look for tanners that contain alpha
hydroxy acids,'' says Daniel Maes, vice president of research and
development at Estee Lauder. ``Acids like citric acid decrease
skin's pH, so color develops into a very natural-looking brown.''
</P>
<P>
   If you want a faux tan but don't want to bother with the mess,
let a professional do it. Day spas offer this service. Prices are
in the $75 to $85 range. Usually included in the price is an
exfoliation treatment as well as application.
</P>
<P>
   For glowing results with self-tanners at home, follow these
suggestions: Choose a shade based on your own skin tone; always
apply tanners to clean skin; rub in the product thoroughly; before
applying a tanner to your face, wash and dry your skin thoroughly;
be patient.
</P>
<P>
   Choose a shade based on your own skin tone. If you have fair
skin, go for a light shade. (You can always reapply for a richer
``tan.'') Medium and dark shades are good for darker complexions
and olive-toned skin.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Always apply tanners to clean skin. Shave your legs and
exfoliate your body with a mild scrub in the shower or tub. Dry off
completely. Most cosmetic companies advise applying a moisturizer
only to joints _ knuckles, ankles, elbows and knees. However, if
you find applying a moisturizer is helpful before putting on a
self-tanner, be sure the moisturizer is well soaked into your skin.
If not, the self-tanner might streak.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Rub in the product thoroughly. Use vertical strokes followed
by horizontal ones. This ensures even color and no missed spots.
Work quickly from feet (don't forget between your toes), to legs,
to torso. By doing this, the self-tanner won't collect in creases
across your waist and behind your knees when you bend over, causing
darker stripes. Do joints last. Ask a friend or spouse to do your
back. Apply self-tanner to back of hands, then immediately wash
palms with soap and water.
</P>
<P>
   Let your body dry for 20-30 minutes. Hint: Wear dark underwear
and loose clothing for several hours after application. And, if you
apply at night, be sure and sleep on old sheets. Some color will
come off.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Before applying a tanner to your face, wash and dry your skin
thoroughly, then mist on a toner. Coat your eyebrows with petroleum
jelly and spread a small amount around your hairline to prevent
discoloration. Then put on a shower cap. Use a tanner sparingly
around the lip and chin area, since it tends to ``grab'' these
areas. Note: Many companies have self-tanners specifically for the
face.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Be patient. Tans start to develop in one to two hours and
usually are fully developed by four hours but each person's body
chemistry is different.

<P>
   Handkerchiefs are fashionable again, but these days stylish
women are wearing them on their back, not tucking them into their
sleeves.
</P>
<P>
   That's because hanky-inspired prints and designs are cropping up
everywhere, in halter tops, pants, blouses and dresses. The
V-shaped handkerchief hemline is even making a comeback for flirt
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   It's all part of the new trend of feminine dressing. Designers
have replaced grunge and androgyny with soft, flowing fabrics,
body-flattering styles and dainty print designs that say, ``I am
woman.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Women want to look like women, feminine, pretty and sexy,''
says LeeAnne Swor, owner of L'Asia a women's boutique in Buckhead.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're buying prints and anything bright-colored. The
handkerchief print is just fun. It's kind of an alternative to
paisley.''
</P>
<P>
   Handkerchief designs are nothing to thumb your nose at. The
print is versatile enough for work or play, subtle enough for curvy
or svelte figures and popular enough to find in a wide range of
stores and prices.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, a lady should always own at least one hanky.

 &HT;    Howard Finster: Ready for heaven
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday June 25.
 &HT;    By Howard Pousner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUMMERVILLE, Ga. _ Word was out that the Rev. Howard Finster,
the godfather of saving souls, the hardest-working man in the folk
art business, had been seriously sick.
</P>
<P>
   So the faithful flocked to Paradise Garden, his wild 3-acre folk
version of the Garden of Eden, during last month's Howard Finster
Fest, a show and sale that offered a thoroughly mixed bag of 60
artists but only one Howard. With the ailing 83-year-old creator
recovering from double pneumonia and congestive heart failure and
battling diabetes, many visitors worried it might be the last
chance to see Finster, get his autograph, hear one of his classic
sermonettes. And, some feared, it might be the final opportunity to
visit Paradise.
</P>
<P>
   Finster, appearing frail, a tad hunched over and shrinking in a
too-big suit, makes no bones that he's ``fixing to leave this here
world.'' But if he's heaven-bound soon, he's also interested in
taking along some lost sheep.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing I'll tell you, find out some of the real facts
before you meet God,'' the pontiff of Paradise preached into a
video camera while sitting on an elevated porch in the back of the
garden in northwest Georgia. Blissfully oblivious to the nearly 100
pilgrims waiting in line at his feet, many holding his posters and
T-shirts and the album covers he designed for R.E.M. and Talking
Heads, Finster was just starting to build up a head of steam.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesus told me. ... ''
</P>
<P>
   Before he lifted off on flames of fire and brimstone, however,
granddaughter Heather Brown tried to yank him back to earth,
imploring, ``Paw-Paw, the people are wrapped around this building
waiting for you!''
</P>
<P>
   Atlantan Mike Hunter decided to forgo the line and instead poke
around Finster's art environment, which he had not visited since
the early '90s. He had no idea of the disappointment in store.
</P>
<P>
   Many consider Paradise Garden Finster's defining achievement, a
Noah's Ark of stuff that the preacher and repair-shop tinkerer
spent decades assembling on reclaimed swampland, showcasing the
inventions of mankind. Creating Paradise was major in his
progression into a full-time sacred artist, with more potential
converts showing up to tour it than he ever saw on a Sunday at any
of the small-town churches where he led prayer.
</P>
<P>
   But today, it's Paradise, a shadow of its former glory, that
needs saving.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the tower of bicycle parts, the pump house of Coke
bottles, the broken-down white Caddy that Finster turned into a
canvas of famous faces, the tomb of an unknown citizen and
countless more oddities are still here. But hundreds of items the
quarreling Finster family sold off in the mid-'90s, and which now
are included in the High Museum of Art and private collections, are
long gone _ including the stretch of sidewalk where Finster
embedded his bicycle and lawn mower repair tools when he turned
totally to art making, as well as entire structures such as the
Bible House. And most of what remains is fading fast or rusting
away.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter was struck by the garden's relative sparseness _ which
seemed dead wrong for a place once renowned for its utter
filled-beyond-the-brim-ness. ``I have great memories of visiting
when I was younger,'' the 37-year-old graphic designer says. ``It
was all overgrown, had kudzu trails you would kind of follow and
come out upon the bicycle-part monolith or other surprising things.
It's nothing like it used to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet perhaps the biggest surprise in the garden is in the retail
shop at its entrance. Here, where the toll-free line, 1-800-FINSTER
(346-7837), rings and rings, prices for Finster's work have doubled
or more. And ``re-creations'' of his popular small painted wooden
cutout figures by daughter Beverly _ including historical and pop
figures like Cleopatra and Elvis and a menagerie of animals _ have
begun to line the shelves.
</P>
<P>
   The inflated prices and imitations (family members have long cut
out Finster's forms and painted in a background color or two, but
never been allowed to do full-fledged copies) are the result of his
diminished output since he was laid low following a March speaking
engagement at New York's Museum of American Folk Art. Known for
cranking out some 30 works per week, and 46,000-plus since 1976,
Finster wasn't able to turn out anything for more than a month.
Recently, the self-proclaimed Man of Visions has managed an average
of half a dozen a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel worthy to be doing God's work,'' Beverly Finster,
44, a schoolteacher turned businesswoman who has managed her
father's art since 1994, says of the re-creations, which both she
and Finster sign. ``But what can I do? We want his work to go on.
We want his message to go on. I feel it's part of my calling.''
</P>
<P>
   At one time or another, at least three other Finster kin, Howard
Finster's son Roy Finster and grandsons Michael Finster and Allen
Wilson, felt that calling. But none has been actively involved in
the garden in years, not after Beverly borrowed $125,000 and bought
out her four siblings. That was, she says, after someone threatened
to burn the place down if her dad deeded it to her.
</P>
<P>
   `I thought it'd go on forever'
</P>
<P>
   For a poor soul who thought he was ``ready to go to the heavenly
land'' but a few weeks before, Howard Finster manages to look
rather sporty one sun-dappled afternoon a few days before Finster
Fest. Greeting visitors in the studio wing of his rambling white
brick house on a leafy downtown Summerville avenue, he's decked out
in royal blue slacks, a madras shirt and a gold sport coat.
</P>
<P>
   But then, Finster, a curious mix of Billy Graham and P.T.
Barnum, has always loved playing to a camera. He's wise enough to
know that there's no such thing as bad ink or video footage when
you're spreading God's glory.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting at his work table _ which is crowded with a Coca-Cola
bottle cutout he's beginning to paint, brushes soaking in mineral
spirits, open paint cans caked with thick skins of enamel, and gobs
of glitter _ he's not shy about telling a photographer what to
shoot. And when the camera's going, count on him clutching one of
his creations to make sure it's in the frame. ``Get a picture of
that,'' he says, pointing a liver-spotted hand at a lithograph of
his rendition of the Last Supper, ``and you might be able to sell
it for $10,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for a frequent cough and the presence of the cane he
holds close, it's easy to forget that Finster has been in the
hospital three times in recent weeks. ``The doctor said it'd take a
long time to get it all coughed out. The flame comes out like
glue,'' he says, mispronouncing ``phlegm.''
</P>
<P>
   Physical ailments seem a mere inconvenience, keeping him from
doing his _ make that the Lord's _ folk art. ``I can't keep my art
around,'' he laments. ``They need two truckloads (at Paradise
Garden's shop) right now for people to pick through. I've got so
many things I could do if I was back to my regular strength.''
</P>
<P>
   During all the years he built up Paradise Garden, Finster
expected it to survive him. But now he's not sure it will. It's
been at least a decade since he was strong enough to tend the
garden and add to its inventory of discarded treasures. Since he
and Pauline, his wife of 67 years, moved from the garden to the
``executive branch'' side of town, seeking peace from family
discord and the steady stream of visitors, Finster has for the most
part limited his appearances to Sunday afternoon cameos.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like for Paradise Garden to live on so that people can
enjoy it,'' he says. ``But visitors have sorrow in the heart when
they see it going down. It's a hard thing to bear. Never did I
think that I'd need more money (to maintain it). I thought it'd go
on forever.''
</P>
<P>
   The subject of money is a sore one. He says that in an effort to
keep his children from doing each other or the garden harm over its
ownership, he gave them their inheritance in cash in advance _ a
total of $150,000, he thinks, though his math and memory are
equally fuzzy. ``And they spent that on cars and stuff that ain't
no good _ nothing that makes money. They just throwed it away.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Beverly, who quit her job as a middle school art teacher in
1996 to try to salvage what remained of Paradise, is not exempt.
``I think sometimes she's not cut out for business,'' he says.
``She's a teacher.''
</P>
<P>
   Beverly Finster asserts she's spent untold thousands on the
garden _ among the big-ticket items, a perimeter fence (vandalism
had long been a problem) and roof repairs to the World's Folk Art
Church, a high-rising, wedding cake-shaped chapel that remains
locked due to structural damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took my daddy 35 years to build this place, and it might
take me 35 years to restore it,'' says Beverly, who runs the
gallery as a for-profit business but incorporated the garden as a
nonprofit, charging an admission earmarked for upkeep.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Finster says he approves of her re-creations of his
paintings (``as long as she continues to copy the Bible verses''),
but he's got his doubts about whether she truly feels his fervor.
``She goes to church, but I can't say she's ready to go to
heaven,'' he says. ``She needs to work on getting closer to God.''
</P>
<P>
   The artist probably never expressed his misgivings about his
heirs more succinctly than in a 1985 painting titled ``The Super
Powers,'' a Cold War allegory in which rows of people must pass
between two threatening black beasts to enter heaven. Lettered
under cottony clouds with smiling faces, a frequent motif for the
glorious afterlife of saved souls, are ``Finsterisms'' including:
``No drunkards to worry about,'' ``Jesus has it all up here'' and
the stinger, ``No more stupid children to fret over.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some family members are really lucky to have family,''
observes Finster friend Larry Schlachter, a Lookout Mountain art
collector and dealer, ``because no one else would put up with
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Selling pieces of Paradise
</P>
<P>
   James Allen, an Atlanta picker _ someone who combs the
countryside for art and other treasures to resell _ received a call
in early 1994 that sent a shiver. The collector on the other end
``told me that he didn't know what was going on but that early
works from Paradise Garden were suddenly showing up in Atlanta for
sale,'' he recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Allen, who had approached Howard Finster many times over the
years only to be rebuffed, sped to Summerville the next day. He was
greeted by Finster's son Roy, who announced that his father was
liquidating some things and the picker could ``go see what I
wanted'' and they could work a deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like saying, `The Vatican is open, take what you
want,''' Allen says.
</P>
<P>
   The picker scoured the garden and came up with a list. He made
out a check to Roy and had his van filled when Howard Finster's
grandson Allen Wilson appeared and argued that Roy didn't have the
authority to sell anything.
</P>
<P>
   Not sure who to believe, James Allen drove directly to Howard
Finster's house. ```I told that boy (Roy Finster) not to sell
anything,''' Allen recalls Finster booming. But when the picker
offered to put everything back, Finster insisted that he take it.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next six weeks, Allen returned for larger and larger
items, ultimately requiring a crew and heavy moving equipment. But
then all the dealings were directly with the artist. ``He knew that
things were disappearing. He could sell them or someone else
could,'' recalls Allen, who comforted Finster by telling him he
thought it all would wind up in worthy public and private
collections, preserved for future generations.
</P>
<P>
   And that's what happened: The High Museum of Art secured the
lion's share, including a series of monumental concrete sculptures,
lengths of Finster-poured mosaic sidewalk and small items like
hanging sun catchers that reflected light into some of the garden's
dark corners. Allen kept one work: a simple metal cutout of a star
on a tall pole.
</P>
<P>
   The picker says he didn't feel ambivalent ``for one second''
about his role in partially dismantling Paradise. ``The garden was
so pathetic then. The buildings were starting to rot, and it was
grown over and returning to a swamp. To think of all the money
that's gone to the family, and none of it's been put back in.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he knew Finster felt all right about the arrangement the
day he invited the artist to come watch the crew remove the
concrete sculpture ``The Calves and the Young Lion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When the front end loader was lifting it from where it had
been (since 1967), pulling it away from the weeds and the muck and
the clutter, Howard just let out a squeal and yelled, `Look at how
beautiful that is!'''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Calves and the Young Lion'' is a highlight of the High's
special Finster gallery, shown with some 35 other objects amid the
museum's permanent collection. It's an unusual space _ a sprawling
chunk of northwest Georgia wooliness plopped among pristine pieces
such as a Henry Moore sculpture. Behind ``The Calves and the Young
Lion'' and two other potent large-scale concrete creations hang
billboard-size black-and-white enlargements showing the works as
they appeared in Paradise Garden _ in better days. But there are
also classic Finster peculiarities such as a small display pairing
sci-fi-looking dental molds and, inexplicably, some Mount St.
Helens volcano dust.
</P>
<P>
   The High claims the installation is the first attempt anywhere
to conserve and display a large-scale outdoor folk environment in a
museum setting.
</P>
<P>
   James Allen estimates that at least $200,000 worth of
collectible pieces remain in Paradise Garden, should Beverly
Finster change her mind and decide to sell any. But while High folk
art curator Lynne Spriggs says she'd like to add more paintings
from Finster's brilliantly inventive early years, she is not eyeing
anything in the garden, which she visited a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned about Finster's condition, she returned with an even
fuller respect for his passion, industry and fortitude. ``When he
started creating sacred art, he went at it with such a sense of
zeal,'' she says. ``He's lived a lot of life hard and fast. He's
put a remarkable amount of energy out in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   On his `last bit of suffering'
</P>
<P>
   On the day his visitors arrive with camera and notebook in hand,
Finster clearly isn't feeling the spark. After recording the Coke
bottle cutout as his 46,397th work in a spiral notebook _
containing page after page of nothing but creakily scrawled numbers
_ he suggests adjourning to the back yard.
</P>
<P>
   He steps unsteadily with his cane back to the plastic lawn
chairs under a couple of maple trees, the uncompleted Coke cutout
dangling from his hand _ just in case there's a photo op.
</P>
<P>
   The swimming pool in the far back, where young Finsters once
cavorted, has been filled up and appears forlorn. Finster says he
closed it to keep youngsters from drowning. Lord knows his kids
have produced a passel: 15 grandchildren, 20 great-grandchildren
and two great-great-grand-
</P>
<P>
   children.
</P>
<P>
   The hush of the late afternoon hardly suits him, though, so he
quickly gets to talking about what will happen when he departs this
mortal coil. ``If I fall dead today with a stroke, I won't know
anything about it,'' he says, resolute as ever. ``When the Lord
takes his people, they don't feel suffering. The last breath you
take is your last bit of suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon, he's interrupted by a church bell in the distance, tolling
its 4 o'clock call.
</P>
<P>
   ``That church bell brings me comfort,'' Finster allows, before
adding what may be the greatest understatement in the twisty
history of folk art: ``You know, I used to be a preacher.''

JUDGE TO RULE SOON ON CHALLENGE TO GLOBE'S TERMS FOR FREELANCERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ After hearing the opening skirmish in the battle
between The Boston Globe and its freelance contributors Friday,
Suffolk County Superior Court Judge Carol S. Ball said she would
rule by Monday on whether to prevent the paper from enforcing a
July 1 deadline for a new ``license agreement'' with freelancers.
</P>
<P>
   That agreement allows freelancers to retain their copyrights but
gives the Globe the right to reproduce their past and future work
in other forms, including online, without additional compensation.
On June 12, a group of freelancers filed a lawsuit, claiming those
terms constitute ``unfair and deceptive trade practices.''
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 750 Globe freelancers face a July 1 deadline to either
sign the deal or stop working for the paper. (Globe spokesman
Richard Gulla said almost 340 contributers have signed to date.)
Friday's hearing was on the plaintiffs' request for an injunction
to set aside that deadline and to prohibit the paper from enforcing
the agreement with those who have signed.
</P>
<P>
   Calling that proposal ``unfair and unconscionable,'' plaintiffs'
attorney Indira Talwani argued that the Globe ``can't say to our
folks, `if you don't sign this unfair contract, we won't even look
at your work.'. . . The threat is that if you do not sign what is
an unfair agreement, we will cease doing business with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Globe attorney William Berkowitz countered that the paper ``is
free to set the terms under which it will do business.'' And while
he characterized the Globe proposal as ``actually more favorable
than those used'' by many other papers, he said the ``mere offer of
a contract that they think is unreasonable'' does not violate the
law.
</P>
<P>
   When Talwani stated that the Globe had issued a ``sign it by
July 1 or you're out'' ultimatum to freelancers, Berkowitz said
contributors who sign later could reestablish a relationship with
the paper.
</P>
<P>
   Ball at one point told Talwaini that ``in fairness, you've got a
tough row to hoe on this one.'' In an interview after the hearing,
Talwani said she was not concerned by the judge's statement,
adding, ``I think she will find it's a novel case, but it's based
on traditional concepts (of) unfairness.''
</P>
<P>
   While declining to read anything into Ball's caution to the
plaintiffs, Berkowitz said the Globe has the ``unfettered right to
say `these are the terms under which we will do business with you.'
''
</P>
<P>
   In one ironic touch, Judge Paul A. Chernoff, who was slated to
hear Friday's arguments, reportedly recused himself because he had
written a piece for the Globe, becoming, as Ball joked, ``a
potential member of the plaintiffs' class.''

 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some actors spend a lifetime trying to grab Hollywood
immortality. Janet Leigh got it in roughly three minutes.
</P>
<P>
   She stepped pretty much naked into a tub, the shower head
squirting steady droplets of cascading water. Even if you haven't
seen Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 horror classic, ``Psycho,'' you know
the rest. The dark figure behind the plastic shower curtain. The
screeching music. The knife. The scream. The blood flowing as water
swirls around the gulping drain. ``Blood. Mother. Oh, God. Mother.
Blood.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt we were doing something innovative, creative and
different,'' says Leigh, who brings ``Psycho'' to the Fox Theatre's
Summer Film Festival on Wednesday for a talk and free showing as an
extension of American Movie Classics' televised Hitchcock Film
Preservation Festival. ``It was exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   And physically tedious.
</P>
<P>
   That short, pivotal shower scene was filmed over seven days,
exactly a third of the total time Leigh spent on the set. She was
fitted with bits of skin-colored cloth below her shoulders (a nude
actress was used in some parts of the scene) and Hitchcock used
warm water in the shower to keep Leigh's discomfort to a minimum.
The director had meticulously planned each shot, each cut (there
are about 70) to create a montage that would have moviegoers
believe Leigh was being stabbed to death when, in reality, the
knife never once cuts skin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each angle was so important,'' Leigh says. ``The editing
provided the tempo. You see the knife going up and down and up and
down. There's the music. I'm screaming. It just seems real.''
</P>
<P>
   There had never been anything quite like it on film. ``Psycho''
was the fourth in a quartet of movies that many critics view as
evidence of a master film technician at the top of his craft (the
others: 1954's ``Rear Window,'' 1958's ``Vertigo'' and 1959's
``North by Northwest'').
</P>
<P>
   As he always did, Hitchcock challenged Hollywood's conventions
and antiquated morality code. ``Psycho'' was the first to show a
toilet (screenwriter Joseph Stefano urged making it part of the
plot), toyed with clothing as Leigh appeared in then-risque scenes
wearing a white or black bra and half-slips, and boldly killed off
a main star midway through the film. While the director always
insisted that breasts were never shown in the stunning shower
scene, a long, mostly out-of-focus body shot as the girl grips the
shower curtain appears to suggest otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Younger moviegoers today are often bored with ``Psycho.''
They're used to seeing violence in much more graphic detail (who
can miss seeing in slo-mo the knife plunged into Drew Barrymore's
chest in ``Scream''?). But ``Psycho'' is a technically astute film
and remarkable for its 1960 cutting-edge craftsmanship.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the turning shot as the camera slowly backs away
from Leigh's eye near the end of the shower sequence required the
cinematographer to constantly hand-focus his lens (today, that
focusing would be on automatic). A special shower head was
constructed for the shot focused directly into the cascading water
to prevent drops from hitting the large lens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought (making `Psycho') was as good as it can get because
Mr. Hitchcock was so brilliant, because of how he was going to
shoot it,'' Leigh says.
</P>
<P>
   She did not hesitate to accept the role. She and the Hitchcocks
had mutual friends and were often seated together at dinner
parties.
</P>
<P>
   Then out of the blue came ``Psycho.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a package in the mail and in it was the novel by Robert
Bloch,'' Leigh says, ``and with it was a note from Mr. Hitchcock
that said, `Janet, please consider the role of Mary Crane.''' (The
name from the book was later changed to Marion after researchers
discovered a woman named Mary Crane living in Phoenix, where the
film opens.) The note also said, ```Of course it will be changed
and not concentrate on the whole heinous life of Norman Bates. And
we're thinking of Anthony Perkins.' It was signed `love,' and Mr.
Hitchcock, you know, drew his profile as his signature. ``All I
knew,'' Leigh says, ``is if he wanted me in a picture, I was
there.''
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear exactly why Hitchcock plucked Leigh from all the
blondes in Hollywood (he was, of course, stuck on blond actresses).
But it could be because of Leigh's striking performance in Orson
Welles' 1958 noir thriller ``Touch of Evil.''
</P>
<P>
   That film, recently restored to much critical acclaim, features
Leigh in a blistering rape scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have to assume that Mr. Hitchcock would have seen an
Orson Welles picture,'' Leigh says, adding that the woman she
played in ``Evil'' was a ``pretty feisty lady, and Marion is
also.''
</P>
<P>
   For ``Psycho,'' Leigh received her only Oscar nomination (she
lost in the supporting actress category to Shirley Jones for her
turn as a prostitute in ``Elmer Gantry''). Leigh did, however, win
the Golden Globe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The movie changed my life,'' the actress says. ``I,
fortunately, did not fall into that position that Tony Perkins did.
He was so brilliant. But after the film people couldn't see him as
anyone but Norman Bates. I must have gotten 100 scripts in a month
dealing with this same kind of situation. I immediately went into
three very different movies.'' (They were the psychological drama
``The Manchurian Candidate,'' the musical ``Bye Bye Birdie'' and
the relationship comedy ``Wives and Lovers.'')
</P>
<P>
   There's one fact from ``Psycho'' that Leigh says has haunted her
for the past 40 years. Since the movie, she insists, she's never
taken another shower.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take only baths. I really had never thought about it, but
seeing it and seeing it that way made me think about it a lot.
You're so vulnerable. You can't hear with the water, you can't see
with the curtain.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I just don't want to go there again.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Last week at Saks Fifth Avenue, Craig Natiello, who
designs for the Halston label, was showing his fall collection to a
circle of his faithful _ young society figures, including Tara
Rockefeller and Somers White. He paused to note that most truly
chic women know how to dramatize their assets. To reinforce the
point, he pulled back his hair, tilted his chin skyward and pursed
his lips in a dowager pout, the image of Diana Vreeland.
</P>
<P>
   Natiello's talent for impersonation has served him well. For a
decade, he worked for Bill Blass, rising to the position of senior
designer. He cultivated Blass' deft way with a pair of shears, his
polished manner and, not least, his personal touch with well-bred
clients.
</P>
<P>
   Bent on entertaining young plutocrats like Nathalie
Gerschel-Kaplan, Marina Rust, Jennifer Creel and Brooke de Ocampo
in what he considered the Blass tradition, Natiello draped them,
regaled them with gossip and squired them to as many dinners and
galas as his calendar would hold.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, he parlayed his creative talent and position as
smooth-talking escort to the young East Side crowd into a coveted
appointment as chief designer for Halston, a post some people think
will seal his status as designer of the hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a lot of good buzz about him _ he's the next big
thing,'' said Cristina Greeven, the publisher and editor of
Manhattan File, a magazine that chronicles the doings of young
celebrities and socialites. Comparing him to competitors like
Michael Kors, another designer with an upper-crust following, she
added, ``Craig is in that phase of carving out a niche in which
social connections are superimportant.''
</P>
<P>
   Natiello has invoked a tradition that dates to the days of
Mainbocher, couturier to the Duchess of Windsor, and recalls
legendary fashion partnerships like those of Jacqueline Kennedy and
Oleg Cassini, Audrey Hepburn and Hubert de Givenchy, Blass and Babe
Paley. It is a specialty role in the world of fashion, to be sure.
Most successful designers _ Tom Ford of Gucci, Ralph Lauren, Tommy
Hilfiger _ did not get that way by cultivating a social elite
little known to the world. They did it by marketing. When they do
forge a bond with a customer, it is likely to be a rock star or
Oscar nominee, who will parade their wares before the world.
</P>
<P>
   But Natiello arrives at a time when Park Avenue chic is stronger
than it has been in a generation _ when ``ladylike'' dressing has
been decreed the freshest thing and women under 35 are reviving
society weddings, balls and other rituals long thought irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess you could say we grew up together,'' Natiello said of
his friendships with de Ocampo, Rust, Kim Hersov and Lillian Wang
von Stauffenberg, all of whom he met while he worked for Blass and
they toiled as junior editors at Elle and Vogue.
</P>
<P>
   His bonds with junior society, in fact, are what gave him the
edge over other candidates when the owners of Halston parted with
the label's previous designer, Kevan Hall, and looked for a
replacement. ``We hired Craig not only because of his talent but
because of his knowledge of the couture customer,'' said Nicholas
J. DeMarco, Halston's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Natiello's connections are an asset for a company intent on
resurrecting Halston as a luxury brand and purveyor of simple but
glamorous evening wear and, beginning next spring, of high-end
daytime clothes, men's clothing and accessories.
</P>
<P>
   At a dinner Natiello gave last week at Swifty's, the gathering
place of the former Mortimer's crowd, Laura Henson, the label's
public relations director, was quick to take up the company line.
Looking around the table crowded with his friends like Andrew and
Jill Roosevelt and James and Whitney Fairchild, she mused: ``What
did they say about Halston? He traveled in the circles of the women
he dressed. Craig is like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Natiello would certainly like you to think so, although he
perhaps overstates his entree into this world. During the American
Fashion Awards this month, he was hardly besieged by air-kissing
society princesses. He and Henson circulated largely alone. Some of
the prominent young women he claims as friends seem to know him
only superficially.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of his Seventh Avenue apprenticeship, the
designer, 38, reinvented himself, in the great American tradition.
The only son of a teacher and a school administrator, he rehearsed
for his chosen part growing up in Hartsdale, N.Y. While majoring in
English at Manhattanville College, he adopted the uniform he wears
to this day _ a slate-colored turtleneck and matching cardigan
coiled around his throat. In his college days, the costume raised
eyebrows. ``I would walk across the quad, and people stared,'' he
recalled. ``Finally, my friend Barbara remarked, `It's a little too
Halston, don't you think?'''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. But then, that was the point. With his shoulder-length
hair and butter-cream complexion, Natiello also bears more than a
passing resemblance to some of New York's better-known socialites.
``He worships Jamie Gregory and Joanne de Guardiola,'' said Steven
Stolman, a fashion designer with stores in Easthampton and Palm
Beach, Fla., who travels in the same circles. ``It's gotten to the
point where he even looks like them.''
</P>
<P>
   Stolman added: ``It's all very theatrical, the blond hair
flying, the cashmere sweaters flapping, very dramatic when you see
it coming toward you on the street.''
</P>
<P>
   Natiello seems to regard himself as a modern composite of
American tastemakers like Blass, Geoffrey Beene and Halston, of
course. He has the manner down: the jaded air and languid posture,
the insouciant, designer drawl. One difference is that he lacks the
well-known self-irony of his idols. On the sales floor at Saks, he
gestured casually toward a black-beaded, sable-trimmed evening
dress. ``It has a sense of body, of confidence, of youthfulness _
it's all in the cut of the jib, you know,'' he said, reproducing
Blass' inflections with an eerie Tom Ripley fidelity.
</P>
<P>
   If his visitors found the performance affected, they gave no
clue, laughing in response.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, it seems, Natiello can count on their
indulgence. They can count on him to cater to their desire for
self-invention. When many better-established designers have
abandoned private fittings, leaving the pinning and tucking to
assistants, Natiello remains a hands-on designer. Fussing over his
charges like Cedric Hampton, Nancy Mitford's hyper-refined aesthete
in ``Love in a Cold Climate,'' he brings out their inner goddess,
and they respond with gratitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before I walked down the aisle at my wedding, Craig actually
fluffed me,'' trilled Roosevelt, whose wedding dress Natiello
designed last year.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part a group of traditional young women whose
collective motto might be ``Don't make waves,'' Natiello's clients
rely on him to make them look provocative and just this side of
tarty. ``He knows how to push someone's style, maybe make it a
little more sexy,'' said Marin Hopper, Elle's fashion director, who
has watched Natiello do fittings. ``He knows how to show off her
body in the best way.''

 &HT;    Army's aim: 'Soup, soap, salvation'
 &HT;    By Derrick Henry
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Most people know the Salvation Army is in the business
of saving souls. From its earliest days in the late 1800s,
Salvation Army officers have sought out sinners in slums, saloons,
streets and brothels.
</P>
<P>
   But the church's efforts do not stop with salvation. The
organization wages war against hunger, poverty, illness and
homelessness, offering a helping hand to the needy of any race,
religion, creed or circumstance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will help anyone,'' says Cate Cummins, public relations
officer for the Salvation Army's Metro Atlanta Command. ``That's
part of our mission statement.''
</P>
<P>
   Founder William Booth was fond of saying: ``Soup, soap and
salvation _ and never reverse the order.''
</P>
<P>
   The Salvation Army now ranks among the world's largest social
service providers. Last year, it offered services to more than
250,000 people in metro Atlanta and more than 33 million worldwide.
Since 1991, it has ranked as America's most popular charity by far
in terms of private donations, according to the Chronicle of
Philanthropy, a national biweekly newspaper of the nonprofit world.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, private donations amounted to $1.2 billion, more than
twice that received by the second-place charity, the YMCA. The
Metro Atlanta Command runs on an annual budget of $12 million.
</P>
<P>
   It does a lot with the money. Within the 14-county metro Atlanta
region, the Salvation Army operates nine community centers
(including ones focusing on Atlanta's growing Asian and Latino
populations), seven thrift stores, five Boys &AMP; Girls Clubs,
low-income housing for senior citizens and disabled adults, and
transitional housing for single men and women as well as families.
</P>
<P>
   To keep pace with the need, the Metro Atlanta Command is in the
midst of a $36 million capital campaign to renovate and expand 12
existing facilities and build four new ones.
</P>
<P>
   Year-round programs include disaster relief, drug and alcohol
rehabilitation for adults, job training, and tutoring for children
and adults. Its Fresh Start Initiative supplies ``Begin Again
Bags'' with housecleaning supplies and toiletries to disaster
victims or formerly homeless families moving into their own
apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous special projects are held throughout the year in metro
Atlanta. In January, the Salvation Army collects and distributes
warm coats and blankets through its Project Overcoat.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer, it runs camps for kids and senior citizens. A
Can-a-Thon food collection drive is held in November. During the
Christmas season, it provides 30,000 children and senior citizens
with gifts through its Angel Tree program. And on Thanksgiving and
Christmas, the Salvation Army serves a community feast to the
hungry and homeless.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have survived because we are adaptable to the needs of the
times and communities we serve,'' says Wes McKinney, director of
donor services.
</P>
<P>
   ``We adapt to anything.''
</P>
<P>
   AT A GLANCE
</P>
<P>
   Volunteer opportunities: The Salvation Army seeks volunteers in
the areas of disaster relief, tutoring children, and serving the
homeless, senior citizens and disabled. There are opportunities to
teach English as a Second Language, provide computer training for
adults, and offer after-school care at the community centers and
Boys &AMP; Girls Clubs. Throughout the year, help is needed with
special programs such as food and clothing collections. During the
Christmas season, the Salvation Army needs volunteer bell ringers
and people to distribute gifts to children and senior citizens and
to serve holiday meals on Thanksgiving and Christmas. Volunteers of
all ages are welcome; volunteers under 16 must be accompanied by an
adult. For more information, call 404-873-3101.
</P>
<P>
   To donate goods: Call 404-522-9783 to arrange for a pickup of
large bundles of clothing, furniture or heavy appliances. The
Salvation Army also accepts motor vehicles. To drop off donated
goods, check the phone book or Georgia Web site for the thrift
store nearest you.
</P>
<P>
   To donate money: Make out a check to Salvation Army, specify the
county or program you wish to support, if desired, and mail to
Salvation Army, PO Box 8237, Atlanta, GA 31106. To make a credit
card donation, call 404-873-3101.

ZIMBABWE OPPOSITION SOLIDLY IN PLACE, OBSERVERS SAY

<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe _ Throughout the campaign for this weekend's
parliamentary elections in Zimbabwe, President Robert Mugabe
repeatedly vowed not only to crush the opposition, but remove it
permanently from the political landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Part bravado, part intimidation _ Mugabe's supporters have
threatened reprisals against villages that vote against the ruling
party _ the boast reflects historical confidence. In the past
decade, as African countries have faced pressure from Western
donors to allow freely contested elections, fledgling opposition
parties have had little success gaining power or surviving defeat
at the ballot box.
</P>
<P>
   But Zimbabwe appears set to break the mold. The Movement for
Democratic Change, which poses the first serious challenge to
Mugabe's party in 20 years, is only nine months old. But unlike
political organizations formed hastily around one person ahead of
elections in countries such as Kenya, Zimbabwe's opposition grew
out of a long consultations among diverse groups tapping broad
popular discontent.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the outcome this weekend, political scientists here say,
democratic ideals are flowering and the days of one-party rule in
Zimbabwe are drawing to a close.
</P>
<P>
   ``This party was not formed by a group of people, but was born
out of the trade unions, women's organizations, and other parts of
civil society,'' said Welshman Ncube, an academic recruited by the
opposition. ``The party is not opportunistic, dashing for power. As
long as those organizations survive, the party will survive.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the past four months, Mugabe's techniques to fend off the
electoral challenge has drawn criticism from the likes of South
Africa's Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who called the Zimbabwean
president ``a caricature of an African dictator.'' Mugabe has
encouraged a campaign of violence against his opponents; blamed the
white minority and the former colonial power, Britain, for
sabotaging Zimbabwe's economy; manipulated voting districts and
voters' rolls; and barred some international observer missions;
manipulating the state-run media and harassing the independent
press.
</P>
<P>
   On the final day of campaigning Friday, 14 opposition party
election officials were abducted by pro-government thugs and held
for several hours. Most were released unharmed, but one candidate,
Zachariah Rioga, was still in a coma Friday night being badly
beaten.
</P>
<P>
   Without such violence, violence, said John Makumbe, head of the
political science department at the University of Zimbabwe, ``the
opposition was looking at sweeping the deck.'' Amid soaring
joblessness and rampant corruption, he said, the people's
discontent has never run deeper.
</P>
<P>
   Ncube said the opposition will claim victory if it wins at least
51 seats, the minimum needed to block a two-third majority in the
150-seat parliament. Mugabe's party held all but three seats in the
previous legislature. The opposition's threshold is within reach,
Makumbe said. The party is likely to sweep the urban vote, and even
with the violence, will probably at least dip into Mugabe's
traditional rural base.
</P>
<P>
   The electoral schedule also favors the opposition. Mugabe's
current term ends in 2002, meaning his foes can start building
immediately on whatever momentum they collect this weekend. Ncube
said his party has already started planning for the presidential
ballot.
</P>
<P>
   The simplest assurance, however, that Zimbabwe is poised to
break the grip of one-party rule lies in the sheer number of
first-time voters who have risked the violence to help the
opposition build a grass-roots base.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Mugabe's supporters belong to the generation that fought
the bush war to end colonialism. Twenty years on, they still equate
freedom with Mugabe's rule. ``So many people died for Zimbabwe to
be free,'' said Dikwi Cosmas, a veteran of the liberation struggle.
``What did this new party do so the country could be free?''
</P>
<P>
   Emmanuel Chamunorwa, in his 20s, who has volunteered with the
opposition in the townships around Kadoma in central Zimbabwe, has
a ready answer for Cosmas. Independence, he said, wasn't supposed
to replace one form of oppression with another.
</P>
<P>
   ``This government has been around 20 years,'' Chamunorwa said.
``We are working for the black man, but still he's blaming the
white man. Mugabe is cheating black people. The fear is broken.
People are tired.''

   The victims of a pair of politically emblematic kidnappings that

Congress who is the brother of one of the government's chief
negotiators in peace talks with leftist guerrillas. He was seized
Monday in an effort to torpedo the talks, while a 5-year-old girl
whose parents said she was being held by the country's main
left-wing guerrilla group was released after 70 days in captivity,
but only after a ransom was paid.

NEW YORK: best way.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Much as he was doing at Saks the other day. Coaxing White, an
event planner at the Horticultural Society of New York, who was
dressed in a T-shirt, tan trousers and Hermes belt, into a racy
black leather jacket, he said, ``It's a little James Bondish, a
little pickup thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The look is sexy, but never vulgar, that's what I like,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Hopper recalled that Natiello's first job at Blass was in
publicity. ``He was very good at introducing the collection to lots
of young people,'' she said. ``It was very smart. The house needed
a younger spokesperson for the world of American glamour.''
</P>
<P>
   After he began designing, Hopper said, it became clear that he
had ``incorporated a younger look into a classic style.'' The
reaction of fashion editors at the time, she said, was, ``Wow,
Bill's never looked so young.''
</P>
<P>
   The designer's loyalists embrace him as one of their own. ``One
thing that makes him mix and match so easily is that he speaks a
kind of shorthand that everybody gets,'' said Helen Schifter, a
former fashion writer for Vogue.
</P>
<P>
   Last March at the Oscars party at Morton's in Los Angeles,
Schifter watched Natiello scrunch up his face and roll his eyes at
the passing parade of luminaries. She interpreted his gestures as
``a slightly wicked running commentary on everyone else in the
room,'' she said, adding, ``For me, it was the funniest 20 minutes
of the whole evening.''
</P>
<P>
   Natiello doesn't confine his comments to strangers. At Swifty's,
he greeted Mai Harrison, who had wed Ridgely Harrison, the model in
the Jenkins gin advertisements, two weeks earlier at a society
ball.
</P>
<P>
   The designer eyed the nickel-size diamond on her hand.
``Tomorrow she'll fry her coffee on that ring,'' he said, cackling.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, he peered at Fairchild, the daughter-in-law of
John Fairchild, the former Women's Wear Daily publisher. She was
wearing gilded Chanel ear tassels and a feathered muffler, which
tended to obscure her chin.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has oodles of style _ and she's not hesitant about showing
it,'' Natiello said with a mix of tact and cattiness. ``She can
take forever deciding what to wear. Sometimes I think she's all
about getting dressed and getting undressed, and why even go to the
party?''
</P>
<P>
   In Natiello's circle, such barbs might pass for wit. ``When you
go out with Craig, you know you're going to have his lens on
everything,'' Schifter said. ``It's sort of like being with Henry
James. A lot of people are very talented but have no people skills.
I love Marc Jacobs, but Craig is more upbeat in some ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Natiello seems to relish his role as society escort. ``He would
be in the category of a walker,'' Greeven of Manhattan File said.
She put a positive spin on a term for the sometimes foppish men who
accompany wealthy women to parties when their husbands are busy or
bored. ``I wish there were more of his kind,'' Greeven said,
sighing. ``People aren't doing that so much anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   If most young married women who relentlessly go out choose to
arrive with a sister these days or in a group of other women or
simply by themselves, there is also a contingent of under-35s who
are happily updating the walker tradition popularized in the 1980s
by the Nancy Reagan set.
</P>
<P>
   Going out with Natiello is like ``being in junior high school
again,'' said Schifter, whose husband, Timothy Schifter, is
president of LeSportsac, the handbag company. ``You get to gossip
in a friendly way. Which husbands in general are not interested in
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   A wave of younger men recognize that the role of escort _ with
no expectations beyond making smart conversation and being well
groomed _ has its advantages. Being seen at the right party with
the right sort of woman is a professional asset, said Todd Romano,
a New York decorator. It reinforces the perception, he said, that
``this fellow is a player, he's part of the scene.''
</P>
<P>
   It also makes for a very good time. ``I don't look at
socializing with my customer as work _ it's a pleasure,'' said
Stolman, who has dressed and hobnobbed with clients like Betsy
Kaiser, C.Z. Guest and her daughter Cornelia. ``Fashion is one of
the few trades in which you're invited to the dinner table, rather
than kept below the stairs. I think that's why a lot of people
choose to become a fashion designer.''
</P>
<P>
   Like designers of old, Natiello is imperious. He issues edicts.
Lose the bracelet, he once told Roosevelt. ``And I did,'' she
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one under 25 should wear my clothing,'' he says haughtily.
``You can't wear these things until you're 30. You don't have a
sense of yourself until you're 30.''
</P>
<P>
   Natiello's new employers are hoping that the authoritative air,
along with a commercial sense he gained at Blass, will finally
bring profitability to Halston, a famous name that has been in
chaos under four owners in the last six years.
</P>
<P>
   The latest proprietor of the label founded by Roy Halston
Frowick is Neema Clothing Ltd., primarily a maker of men's wear.
</P>
<P>
   As Natiello tells it, some months before Blass announced his
retirement last year, he took his assistant aside and told him
Halston was searching for a new designer. Blass wrote a letter
recommending Natiello to Halston's chief executive, DeMarco, who
confirmed this account.
</P>
<P>
   Why would Natiello jump to an extremely shaky label when he
might have expected to inherit the top job at Blass? ``It was the
moment to come out from under the mantle,'' Natiello explained.
``When I was ready to leave, it was Bill who told me, `Put your own
stamp on it.' And at Halston I can. This is my own gig.''
</P>
<P>
   He dreams of rebuilding Halston into the luxury brand it was but
has not been for years. ``This is the only fashion house in America
that can actually be Gucci-ized,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He fantasizes about dressing even more of the understated
fashion icons of his day. At his showroom on Seventh Avenue last
week, Natiello said: ``You know who's so good at that throwaway
thing is Nina Griscom. She has that Babe Paley thing. She always
looks like she just came out of the pool, put on that great dress
and looks fantastic.''
</P>
<P>
   Is Griscom a client? Natiello flipped back his hair. ``No,'' he
replied with a level stare. ``Not yet.''

APPEALS COURT CLEARS WAY FOR ELIAN TO RETURN TO CUBA 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Reorganizes and rewrites completely. Note new byline.)  
 By RICK BRAGG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ A federal appeals court in Atlanta has refused to
reconsider the case of Elian Gonzalez, leaving the U.S. Supreme
Court as a last hope for the Miami relatives who want to prevent
his return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the nation's highest court intervenes, a step considered
unlikely, the 6-year-old and his father, who have been living in
Maryland and later in Washington while the legal appeals play out,
would be free to leave the United States and return to Cuba after 4
p.m. Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The 12 members of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals not
only denied the Miami relatives' request for a re-hearing Friday,
but they did not even call for a vote on the question.
</P>
<P>
   The relatives' lawyers, Judge J.L. Edmondson wrote in the
unanimous opinion, should direct any requests for a further stay of
the deadline to the Supreme Court, and wrote that the appeals court
would not grant any future motions for a stay. He wrote the ``NOT''
in bold, oversized letters.
</P>
<P>
   Approval from seven of the 12 members of that court was needed
for a re-hearing of the case, in which a three-judge panel had
ruled June 1 in favor of the government and, indirectly, Elian's
father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the nine Supreme Court justices must agree to hear an
appeal, but a single justice can grant a stay, or refer the
question about a stay to the full court.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy is the Supreme Court member assigned
to hear emergency cases like this one. If he does not act on a
stay, the father could legally put his son a plane for Cuba as
early as 4:01 p.m. Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for the Miami relatives, Spencer Eig, said the
relatives here will appeal, and seek a stay of that deadline. ``We
feel the future of a small boy is important enough to take to the
highest court,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But legal experts say that a stay seems unlikely, and that a
friendly ruling for the Miami relatives is, if the case is heard,
even more unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a pack-your-bags decision,'' said Pamela Falk, a
professor of international law at the City University of New York
who has argued similar cases before. ``The legal issues are over.
The family has exhausted every remedy. They had their day in court.
They had many days.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, where Elian has been living with his father,
step-mother, half-brother and a delegation of friends and teachers
from Cuba, a lawyer for Juan Miguel Gonzalez said the family has
not decided when they would leave the country if the stay actually
does expire.
</P>
<P>
   The Gonzalez family, said Gregory B. Craig, their lawyer,
``looks forward to resuming a normal life.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno, who has been criticized for her
handling of the case, said she was ``pleased that the 11th Circuit
Court of Appeals has acted unanimously in denying the motion for
re-hearing. Now that the court has conclusively upheld our
decision, I am hopeful that this father and son will soon be able
to move on with their lives together.''
</P>
<P>
   In their appeal, lawyers for Lazaro Gonzalez, the boy's Miami
great uncle, had argued that the three-judge panel was wrong to
uphold an Immigration and Naturalization Service decision to return
Elian to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The three-judge panel had found that, while the court might
disagree with sending the boy back to a Communist government with a
long, dismal history on human rights, the law gave wide discretion
to the immigration agency in such cases and that the powers of the
executive branch of government should be respected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since this case does not present a complicated legal issue,
there is no reason to expect the Supreme Court to take interest in
this appeal,'' said David Abraham, a professor of immigration law
at the University of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, where Lazaro Gonzalez kept the boy in his home after
he was rescued at sea in November and until the armed federal raid
reunited him with his father in April, people were disappointed,
but there were no demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the house where Elian had lived, which has become a
shrine of sorts in the exile community, only a few people showed up
to voice their displeasure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel it's a case that is appropriate for the Supreme
Court,'' said Eig, the lawyer for the Miami relatives. He said the
relatives' lawyers will argue that Elian has constitution rights to
apply for asylum.
</P>
<P>
   But the Supreme Court is more likely to affirm Juan Miguel
Gonzalez's rights in the case, said Falk. ``It is so highly
unlikely that the Supreme Court will grant even an emergency
injunction.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian has been at the middle of an international custody battle
since he was found floating on an inner tube off the coast of
Florida on Thanksgiving Day. He was one of three survivors of a
failed crossing from Cuba that drowned his mother and 10 others.

PHILIPPE CHATRIER, 72, A FORCE ON INTERNATIONAL TENNIS SCENE 
</HEADLINE>
   By SUSAN B. ADAMS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was a time in the 1970s and the '80s, when Philippe
Chatrier wore dual chapeaux as president of the International
Tennis Federation and president of the French Tennis Federation,
that all roads in tennis led through Gaul. That era officially
ended Thursday when Chatrier, the man responsible for the return of
tennis to the Olympics and the renaissance of his home Grand Slam
tournament, the French Open, as one of the game's four most
prestigious championships, died at age 72.
</P>
<P>
   Chatrier had suffered from Alzheimer's disease for several years
and died in the Brittany town of Dinard, the French Tennis
Federation announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
   As a player, journalist and administrator, Chatrier parlayed a
deep passion for tennis with an instinct for making deals that
showcased the game. France's junior champion at 17 in 1945, a
member of its Davis Cup team from 1948 to 1950 and its captain from
1969 to 1972, Chatrier gave up playing internationally in 1953 to
launch Tennis de France, the nation's first tennis magazine.
</P>
<P>
   But it was in the twin roles as head of the French federation
(1973-93) and the international federation (1977-91) that he
reached his zenith as a power broker in international athletics.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a great influence in world sports and weighed heavily
on the evolution of tennis,'' Christian Bimes, the current French
federation president, told The Associated Press Friday. ``Under his
impetus, tennis, a sport that was living in the past, became a
major sport.''
</P>
<P>
   Bimes said the rebirth of the French Open, the return of tennis
to the Olympics and France's Davis Cup victory in 1991 were
Chatrier's most memorable accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   Said Francesco Ricci Bitti of Italy, the international
federation's current president, ``I'll always regard him as the
father of international tennis.''
</P>
<P>
   Urbane, charming and indefatigable, Chatrier understood both the
velvet glove and the iron fist of international sports politics. He
worked tirelessly toward the creation of open tennis, in which
professionals and amateurs play together, which began in 1968. As
the International Tennis Federation president, which entitled him
to a seat on the International Olympic Committee, he was the
indomitable force in returning tennis to the Olympics, first as a
demonstration sport in 1984 and then as a medal sport in 1988 after
an official absence of 64 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``An extremely shrewd judge of character,'' Bitti said, ``he was
one of the greatest talent scouts that I have ever met.''
</P>
<P>
   On the recommendation of Arthur Ashe in 1971, Chatrier enrolled
Yannick Noah, an 11-year-old from Cameroon, in the French
development program. Twelve years later Noah won the 1983 French
Open, becoming the first Frenchman to win since 1947. It was only
Chatrier's most visible step in revitalizing tennis in France. In
his tenure as the French federation president, the number of
registered players rose from 224,000 to 1,350,000. Chatrier was
also devoted to tennis' traditions and did not hesitate to punish
or criticize what he considered transgressions to its heritage.
When Jimmy Connors chose to play World Team Tennis in 1974,
Chatrier called the renegade league a ``circus'' and banned Connors
from the French Open that year, perhaps costing the world's No.
1-ranked player a Grand Slam of the game's four major tournaments;
Connors won the other three _ the Australian Open, Wimbledon and
the U.S. Open. In 1990, Chatrier chastised Andre Agassi when he
showed up at Roland Garros stadium in a typically unorthodox _
black and pink _ outfit; Agassi returned serve by calling Chatrier
a ``bozo.''
</P>
<P>
   Chatrier was married twice, first in 1953 to Suzanne Partridge
of England and then to the former French golf champion Claudine
Cros in 1993. He is survived by a son, Jean-Philippe. &QL;

PASSION FUELS ``DON QUIXOTE''
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
Our rating: 3 stars 
By REED JOHNSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's nothing like the blood and thunder of Spanish folk dance
to take the chill out of classical ballet. Icy technical perfection
is fine as far as it goes. Crisply executed pirouettes can
mesmerize the soul.
</P>
<P>
   But the passionate gypsy and flamenco currents that pulsate
through the Bolshoi Ballet's new production of ``Don Quixote''
bring an earthiness and comic vigor to what might otherwise seem a
rather silly and superficial ballet, a parade of virtuosic set
pieces stitched together with the thinnest of plots.
</P>
<P>
   As it stands, this relentlessly festive and athletic ``Don
Quixote'' offers a nonstop outpouring of baroque effusion. Sheer
unthinking pleasure is all that will be required of you as you
watch the Bolshoi's spectacular soloists, the astonishing Nina
Ananiashvili foremost among them.
</P>
<P>
   Making its first appearance at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in
more than a decade, the legendary Russian company is performing the
popular three-act ballet based on parts of Cervantes' episodic
novel about a deluded old knight, with Ludwig Minkus' somersaulting
score. The Bolshoi refers to the production as a ``new
choreographic version'' by Alexei Fadeechev, based on the enduring
designs of Marius Petipa and Aleksandr Gorsky.
</P>
<P>
   The new version builds momentum by skillfully balancing its
classical and gypsified elements. There's a colorful vernacular of
tambourine slapping, fan twirling and castanet clicking. Lines of
dashing toreadors flourish capes, while a woman minces en pointe
through a maze of upended knives. We get just enough kinkiness to
offset the elegant sensuality, just enough whirling control to tame
the mad, leaping score.
</P>
<P>
   Ananiashvili, beautiful and indefatigable, exemplifies both
tendencies as Kitri, the innkeeper's daughter whose love for the
barber Basil (Andrei Uvarov), against the wishes of her father,
arouses Don Quixote's chivalrous instincts.
</P>
<P>
   Though showing somewhat more poise than personality,
Ananiashvili is an engaging presence, conveying the pluck and
enthusiasm of a young girl. Her rapid-fire sequence of fouettes,
turns on one leg, brought the expected roars from the balcony, but
it was her spirit as well as her technique that won us over.
</P>
<P>
   Her elongated partner, Uvarov, with his scything, black-tighted
legs, demonstrated strength and grace in his solos and his
one-armed hoists of Ananiashvili. It should be interesting to see
what this pair does tonight with ``Romeo and Juliet,'' the other
half of the Bolshoi's bill.
</P>
<P>
   Gaunt Andrei Sitnikov, gallantly mistaking Kitri for the beloved
Dulcinea of his medieval fantasies, makes the most of the mimed
title role. His eyes locked in a dreamy gaze, he wanders through
Barcelona squares, moonlit taverns, a windmill-lined gypsy
encampment and a fairy-haunted forest, all beautifully designed by
Sergei Barkhin. Playing his faithful servant Sancho Panza,
Alexander Petukhov has a charming Chaplin-esque comic grace: he
beams with delight at his master's triumphs and his legs always
seem to be two steps behind his chubby trunk.
</P>
<P>
   By its third act, ``Don Quixote'' pretty much drops any
pretensions of storytelling in favor of one stunning duo or solo
after another: a Spanish dance, a gypsy dance, a bolero. It takes
something special for a company to try such a sequence, let alone
pull it off with such aplomb. We could all do with more of that
reckless kind of idealism. &QL;

   ``You turn your back on a child for one second and that child

community outreach officer for the Los Angeles County Fire
Department. ``We stress all the time not to take your eyes off the
kids while they're in the pool or even near a pool.''
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 40 young children drown in Los Angeles County every
summer, which accounts for half of all accidents annually involving
children 5 and under.
</P>
<P>
   Every summer, professionals like Rodriguez try to hammer home
the message of water safety, hoping to reach parents, party hosts
and guests who might attend everything from simple poolside
get-togethers to graduation, birthday or holiday parties _ where
food, drink, games and other children too easily can distract
watchful eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 70 percent of drownings in Los Angeles County have
occurred in swimming pools, while 30 percent have taken place in
bathtubs, hot tubs, toilets _ even buckets and puddles. Of
incidents involving swimming pools, 65 percent took place at the
home of the child's immediate family, 33 percent occurred at the
homes of friends and relatives, and two percent occurred elsewhere,
such as public pools, according to county figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The drowning cases are often cases where everyone at the party
thought that somebody else was watching their kids at all times,''
said Holly Craig, a pediatric nurse in Northridge, who promotes
child safety inside and outside the home through ``Child and Parent
Resources,'' a nonprofit group. ``You have to, have to, keep an eye
on children in water at all times.''
</P>
<P>
   Most drowning victims had been out of sight for less than five
minutes _ about the time to answer the phone, use the bathroom or
grab a glass of water, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent common mishaps, Child and Parent Resources suggests
parents and party hosts set strict rules at their discretion. For
example, forbid diving during large gatherings, limit the number of
children in the pool at one time, limit diving or jumping to one
person at a time, have everyone exit the pool area when food is
served, or mark the pool deck in chalk to indicate where diving in
shallow areas is forbidden.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez recommends that parents, siblings, friends and family
members take scheduled turns supervising pools _ even for using the
bathroom or grabbing an iced tea.
</P>
<P>
   For parents or party hosts who can afford it, Craig recommends
hiring a professional lifeguard for large gatherings. Area
community centers and pools can refer lifeguards.
</P>
<P>
   Experts also encourage parents to teach children how to get an
adult's attention and help immediately if another child is in
trouble and _ for more serious medical emergencies _ make sure
children know how to call 911.
</P>
<P>
   Homeowners should make sure their pools have basic rescue
equipment handy, such as a ring buoy on a rope, that can be thrown,
can keep the child afloat and pull him or her to safety. Other
poolside items should include a CPR instruction poster, phone to
call 911, waterproof first-aid kit, approved life preserver vests
(in child and adult sizes) and approved flotation devices for
children.
</P>
<P>
   And any rescue professional would tell pool owners that it's a
good idea to know CPR (cardio pulmonary resuscitation), which
requires an annual certification renewal and four-hour classes.
</P>
<P>
   Near-drownings can have devastating consequences, noted Dr. Alan
Kuban, Emergency Department director for West Hills Hospital and
Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Brain damage grows worse the longer a person goes without
oxygen, he said, adding that lasting effects can range from motor
skill and thought- process problems to vegetative, coma-like
states.
</P>
<P>
   Though less frequent, diving accidents sometimes result in
serious spinal cord injuries such as paralysis.
</P>
<P>
   But the most common injuries suffered in and around pool areas
are less severe.
</P>
<P>
   Broken bones, sprains, bad cuts and even concussions often
result from falls on slippery decks or from diving boards, said Dr.
Marc Kerner, a trauma surgeon at Northridge Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``Making sure there's no glass around the pool area is an
obvious way to prevent injury, but you'd be surprised by how many
badly cut feet we see,'' said Kerner. &QL; 
---A step further &QL; 
Many specialty swimming pool retailers carry products that do
everything from securing hot tubs and preventing falls on slippery
decks, to fencing off pool areas and setting off child safety
alarms.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, homeowners can place safety signs in pool areas.
</P>
<P>
   Signs reading ``no running,'' ``no diving,'' ``no glass near
pool,'' ``pool capacity'' and ``caution: wet deck'' sell for about
$5 each, said James Thomas, manager of Our Pool Store in Woodland
Hills and Glendale.
</P>
<P>
   Other inexpensive products include tread kits, which provide
some traction on slippery decks, stairs and ladders; floating
``stringers'' that rope off shallow swim areas from the deep end,
and collapsible canvas barriers, which prevent entry to the pool
area when not in use.
</P>
<P>
   Jacuzzi owners too can equip ``hot tubs'' with locking covers
and safety grates. The grate (about $14), placed over the main
suction drain, keeps small children from getting pulled and tangled
in the drains of older model hot tubs.
</P>
<P>
   For homeowners with larger budgets, Our Pool Store owner Ron
Susca recommends the Kiddie Catch, a $1,200 netting kit that
stretches across the pool when not in use, to catch fallen
children; a see-through screen mesh fence (at $20 per foot) that
stands four feet high and completely surrounds the pool; and
mechanical vinyl pool covers, which run about $6,000.
</P>
<P>
   Pool alarms sound alerts inside the home when someone has
entered or fallen into a swimming pool. Starting at around $150,
some models detect motion in the water, while others are tripped
when a laser beam field over the pool is broken. Wrist-worn alarms
sound when a child's wrist is submerged in water.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter what gadgets and safeguards are in place, experts
emphasize there are no substitutes for child supervision and taking
the time to educate children on water safety and hazards.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can child-proof your pools, but children by nature are not
pool- safe,'' said Kuban. ``They need supervision at all times.'' &QL; 
---What to do if a child is in trouble in a pool:
</P>
<P>
   1. Yell for help.
</P>
<P>
   2. Get the child out of water.
</P>
<P>
   3. Call 911 immediately for emergency medical assistance.
</P>
<P>
   4. Begin CPR if trained. If not trained in CPR, follow telephone
instructions from fire department until medics arrive, or consult
emergency instructions in local telephone book.

 &QL; 
By far the most important rule for preventing pool drownings is to
use constant supervision. Children in or around pools should be
watched by an adult at all times. But here are some additional ways
to safeguard your kids:
</P>
<P>
   1. Erect a 4- to 5-foot fence completely surrounding pools and
spas. Fences should provide clear views of pools and have no
vertical openings wider than four inches. Do not install fences
that children can climb.
</P>
<P>
   2. Install self-closing gates at entrances to pools and spas,
with safety latches that children cannot reach.
</P>
<P>
   3. Lock all doors in the home that lead to pool area at all
times. (Also note that small children can exit through ``doggie
doors.'') Motion sensors can also be installed at doors leading to
pools that sound an alarm when tripped.
</P>
<P>
   4. When pool is in use, remove pool covers completely and stow
neatly.
</P>
<P>
   5. Secure, lock or remove steps and ladders leading to
above-ground pools when not in use.
</P>
<P>
   6. Keep in-ground pools lit at night.
</P>
<P>
   7. Keep all pets, toys and child amusements out of pool area
when not in use. Do not let children play in the vicinity of a pool
or leave a child alone by a pool.
</P>
<P>
   8. Children who cannot swim well should swim with an adult in
water, or wear personal flotation devices (PFDs) approved by the
United States Coast Guard (USCG) or Underwriters Laboratories (UL).
Note that some flotation devices, such as inflatable ``arm
floaties'' and waist rings, may make it easier for children to
swim, but are not approved life-savers. Toddlers, even infants,
should receive swim lessons, as well.
</P>
<P>
   9. Do not allow glass in pool areas. Have children wear
protective footwear when they are not swimming. Reduce slippery
surfaces by installing tread kits. And do not allow children to run
on pool decks.
</P>
<P>
   10. Keep basic rescue equipment such as roped buoy rings,
first-aid kits and CPR emergency instructions poolside at all
times. Make sure every household member knows how to respond to
drownings, near-drownings and other accidents. Also make sure they
know how to call 911 for emergency medical assistance.
</P>
<P>

Los Angeles County Fire Department Community Relations Office at

FISHING FOR BASS, AND BIG PROFITS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ind., Minn., Ky., Ala.)   By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ The phone rings and Irwin L. Jacobs, the fabled
corporate raider of the 1980s, cannot hide his emotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh my God,'' he says, holding the telephone to his ear. ``Get
out of here!'' A long pause. ``Goodness. Yes. Do it.''
</P>
<P>
   He turns to his visitor. ``I apologize,'' he says. ``There's
something important going on.''
</P>
<P>
   That something is a sharp rise in shares of Conseco, the big but
beleaguered insurer, on a news report that Gary C. Wendt, a former
General Electric executive, is a leading candidate to head the
company. Jacobs keeps reaching for his hot line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Again? How many shares have traded?'' He paces. ``Wow! OK
Bye.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs scheduled this meeting at his 25th floor office in
downtown Minneapolis two weeks earlier to talk about his latest
passion: a national bass fishing tournament. But he keeps getting
interrupted. He confesses that the talk about him having designs on
Conseco might be true. ``There's no question we've had discussions
with people,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs grew enormously wealthy two decades ago by acquiring
large stakes in troubled companies like Kaiser Steel and Walt
Disney and then selling them for big profits. But on this day, he
does not tip his hand as to whether he is just interested in seeing
his Conseco investment climb in value _ he has been buying shares
over the last few months _ or whether he is plotting a full-fledged
takeover of the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing definite,'' he says. ``But we are looking at
all our options.''
</P>
<P>
   He bought a few hundred thousand shares several years ago, when
Conseco and its acquisition-minded founder, Stephen C. Hilbert,
were the hot growth story in the insurance business. Conseco stock
started collapsing last year, partly because of sharp declines at
the finance unit that was formed by the acquisition of the Green
Tree Financial Corp. More recently, as the market judged that
Hilbert had paid too much for Green Tree, a mobile home lender,
Jacobs did what he has been doing for decades: buying shares in
what he considered a temporarily out-of-favor stock.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen million shares, in fact. ``I noticed the shorts were
selling,'' Jacobs, 58, recalls. ``They were selling to me. I
concluded this thing was a license to steal at $5 a share.''
</P>
<P>
   The shares fell to as low as $4.50 in mid-May, but soon
rebounded to $7 on speculation about Wendt. They have since
retreated to $5.75.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics, however, say Jacobs has a penchant for hinting at
takeover bids to drive up a stock and then failing to follow
through. A few years ago, he moved to get control of MEI
Diversified, which owns hair salons and a variety of other
businesses _ and then dropped out.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I told you what I thought about Irwin Jacobs, he'd sue me
within 24 hours,'' said Marc Kozberg, president of Dougherty Value
Advisors here and a former shareholder of MEI Diversified. ``The
first question I would ask is whether he has the wherewithal to buy
Conseco.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to respond, Jacobs, with more than $50 million by his own
account invested in Conseco, hints that he has assembled a ``team''
to arrange a possible takeover. He will not say more.
</P>
<P>
   He stops talking about Conseco and returns to his other
preoccupation: Operation Bass. This meeting, after all, was about
bass fishing, not corporate raiding.
</P>
<P>
   With Genmar Holdings, his boat manufacturing business, in a
slump in the early 1990s, Jacobs commissioned a study and found
that ``our fishing customer was there all the time, even in a down
market.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Why aren't we catering to their passion?'''
</P>
<P>
   That is when Jacobs bought Operation Bass, a 40-employee company
based in Gilbertsville, Ky., that is a leader in bass tournament
promotions. The deal, if one of his smallest, has been one of his
most satisfying in years.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Jacobs _ worth an estimated $400 million _ wanted to
find a way to publicize Genmar's fishing boats, including the
Ranger and Wellcraft brands. But then he recognized an audience
bigger than potential boat owners: the 55 million Americans who go
fishing each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the largest group of untapped consumers,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs says people who love fishing tend to be loyal _ and buy
billions of dollars' worth of consumer goods. His vision: Why not
splash corporate logos on fishing boats, the way Nascar paints its
race cars? ``The Nascar demographics are identical,'' he says.
``And no one has marketed to them.''
</P>
<P>
   He put up some prize money and convinced Wal-Mart Stores to
become the lead sponsor of the annual Operation Bass fishing
tournament, which was held this weekend in Florence, Ala., and is
one of the largest in the world. He corralled Kellogg's, Coca-Cola
and Visa as backers, too.
</P>
<P>
   He also got busy generating publicity. There is a Wheaties box
with Denny Brauer, the champion of the 1998 tournament, feted as
``Angler of the Year.'' ABC News did a report on the fishing
tournament; ESPN, its sister network, now broadcasts it every year.
Did he mention the research report showing that fishing is more
popular than tennis and golf combined?
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, Genmar _ a private company that he acquired in
the 1970s and transformed into the world's second-largest boat
maker _ was on the verge of bankruptcy. Now, says Jacobs, who
remains Genmar's chairman, it is growing at a 30 percent clip, with
sales approaching $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   He has fish on his mind, almost all the time. Off to lunch in a
nearby restaurant with Genmar's chief executive and chief financial
officer, Jacobs says he has come up with a recipe that ``fishing
people'' might love _ a fish batter that he says Kellogg has
expressed interest in marketing. ``This is pretty good,'' he says,
tasting some trout he has arranged to have prepared in the batter.
``What do you guys think?''
</P>
<P>
   The more provocative question, of course, is this: What's next
for this deal maker turned bass-fishing promoter?
</P>
<P>
   Unpredictability, he says. That is the course he has always
taken. ``If you look back at every deal I've done, I haven't tried
to be unpredictable; it's just the circumstances that make me do
what I do,'' he says. ``I'm just flexible.''
</P>
<P>
   So if shares of Conseco, based in Carmel, Ind., an Indianapolis
suburb, do not begin to climb soon, keep an eye on Jacobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't expect me to move to Indianapolis,'' he says. ``But I've
made serious investments, and I've made one in Conseco. So I would
seriously consider doing something about that.'' &QL;

CAMPAIGNER FOR `FREE BURMA' BEGINS AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)   By CAREY GOLDBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ So sanguine is Simon Billenness that he seems not the
least bit downcast by this week's U.S. Supreme Court decision
overturning the Massachusetts ``Burma Law,'' which he co-wrote.
</P>
<P>
   There are, after all, so many other economic tools to use
against companies that support the totalitarian regime of Myanmar,
formerly Burma. And as a superspecialist in this kind of battle,
using financial pressure to fight foreign oppression, he knows all
of them: divestment campaigns, consumer boycotts, shareholder
resolutions, the whole gamut.
</P>
<P>
   Billenness enumerated them as he sat surrounded by 2-foot-high
stacks of paper (``Here I am working to topple a military
dictatorship, and I have trouble finding things on my desk!'' he
lamented in the cheery clip of his native Britain) and books with
titles like ``The Anguish of Tibet'' and ``Corporate Crime and
Violence.''
</P>
<P>
   The desk belongs to Trillium Asset Management, a Boston concern
that, with $675 million in client money, labels itself the United
States' largest and oldest independent investment firm dedicated
totally to ``socially responsible'' investment.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Trillium's employees actually work at investing money,
but Billenness, 35, a senior research analyst, has the particular
luxury of spending virtually all his time on social advocacy, like
figuring out how best to support the democracy movement in Myanmar,
whose leaders are accused of torture, forced labor and brutal
repression.
</P>
<P>
   With nary a pause after the Supreme Court decision, Billenness
and other members of the Free Burma Coalition, a national umbrella
group, plan to begin a push this summer to get cities and states to
pass new laws penalizing companies that do business with Myanmar,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court's ruling against the Massachusetts law, which
largely barred the state government from doing business with
companies that trade with Myanmar, was narrow enough that it left
room for states and cities to pass such homegrown foreign-policy
measures, Billenness said _ provided they are not pre-empted by
federal law, as the Massachusetts measure was.
</P>
<P>
   So there is room for a continued local-global campaign that is,
not coincidentally, reminiscent of the movement to fight South
African apartheid by economic means like divestment.
</P>
<P>
   Here is the Massachusetts link: In 1993, Billenness, a freshly
minted MBA from Boston College, went to watch a news conference
about the end of economic sanctions against South Africa. There he
met Byron Rushing, a prominent legislator who had written the
state's law on anti-apartheid sanctions. And he suggested that
Rushing do something similar for Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
   Rushing said he would need more information on the country.
Billenness provided it, including a statement by Nobel Peace Prize
laureates calling for sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Rushing eventually gave Billenness a copy of the bill he wrote
on South Africa sanctions and asked him to adapt it for Myanmar. So
Billenness went home, he said, ``and typed it out word for word,
except that whenever I came to `South Africa,' I put in `Burma.'
Then I gave it back to him on a disk, and that's how I
`co-authored' the law on Burma.''
</P>
<P>
   Rushing introduced the bill in 1994, and it passed in 1996.
Citing the Massachusetts law, a number of companies pulled out of
Myanmar, among them Apple Computers and Hewlett-Packard, Billenness
said. But by 1997 a backlash began as well. There was, he said,
``quite a kerfuffle.''
</P>
<P>
   The European Commission formally protested, and in 1998 the
National Foreign Trade Council, a Washington-based association,
brought suit. The law's opponents said it violated international
trade agreements and interfered with the federal government's
function of making foreign policy. They won in federal court. And
now they have done so again in the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Why was the Myanmar law challenged, while the South Africa laws
never were? The economy has become so globalized, Billenness said,
that more than ever, ``if you pass a selective purchasing law in
any city in the world, it will have import far beyond its
borders.''
</P>
<P>
   That brought trouble for the Massachusetts law, but ``it shows
how we as consumers, as investors, can use our freedom in the
marketplace to effect political and social change,'' he said
</P>
<P>
   Billenness said he believed ``the battle has been more important
than the result,'' in that the Massachusetts law helped bring talk
about Myanmar to the forefront. Seventy-eight members of Congress
expressed support for the law, as did 22 state attorneys general.
</P>
<P>
   The movement is growing, as reflected in the thousands of names
on his e-mail lists, all collected over the last few years.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Billenness himself came to the ``Free Burma'' cause in a rather
researched, though by no means cold-hearted, way. A native
Londoner, he is the second son of parents who met at a Young
Liberals conference and who remain active in Britain's Liberal
Party. He became actively Liberal himself by the age of 14, even
resuscitating a local Young Liberals chapter.
</P>
<P>
   After he graduated from Loughborough University in 1985, he
married an American _ he has since divorced _ came to the United
States and began working in finance from the ground up, as a bank
teller. He quickly overcame his initial confusion between the
American dime and the nickel, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He gravitated toward ``socially responsible'' investing (to this
day, he has a Working Assets Visa card _ ``plastic with purpose''
that contributes a percentage of purchases to causes) and
ultimately worked his way up to his job as one of two employees at
Trillium who devote all their time to social advocacy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, when he was still an intern at the firm, he wrote a
report on which human rights issues most needed attention from
concerned investors, and Myanmar was one of them, along with
sweatshops and China. So it began.
</P>
<P>
   And so it continues. Last year, Billenness noted, Hootie &AMP; the
Blowfish, a rock band and a client of Trillium Asset Management,
was playing at a San Diego concert sponsored by Suzuki, which is
the target of a consumer boycott for investing in Myanmar. Guess
who provided the T-shirts that some of the band members wore
reading ``Suzuki out of Burma''?

following chart shows how senators and representatives voted on key
bills and amendments within the last week. A ``Y'' means the member
voted for the measure; an ``N'' means the member voted against the
measure; a ``?'' means the member did not vote; and a ``P'' means
the member voted ``present.''
</P>
<P>
   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: Federal
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Tuesday approved, 57-42, an amendment by Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., to enhance federal enforcement of hate
crimes. Part of the Defense Appropriations bill, the provision
would allow the prosecution of violent crimes based on a victim's
sexual orientation, gender or disability. Supporters contented it
would punish hate crimes. Opponents assert it would infringe on
state and local law enforcement. A ``yes'' vote supports federal
hate crime legislation.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: State
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Tuesday passed, 50-49, a measure by Sen. Orrin
Hatch, R-Utah, to study and support hate crime investigations by
state and local law enforcement agencies. The measure is part of
the Defense Appropriations bill. Supporters argued that the measure
would create a strong and workable assistance program for state and
local law enforcement. Opponents contended that the provision would
not protect all Americans from hate crimes. A ``yes'' vote
supported state and local funding to prevent and prosecute hate
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: Helicopter
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Wednesday rejected, 47-51, an amendment to provide
at least $110 million for helicopters to stem the cultivation of
drugs in Colombia as part of a Foreign Operations Appropriations
bill. Proponents said it would have allowed the military to use
Black Hawks, which can fly higher and farther than other
helicopters. Opponents complained that Black Hawks were expensive
to operate and maintain. A ``yes'' vote supports funds for
helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   4) BILL NUMBER: Medicare
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday rejected, 44-53, a provision to contain
the cost of Medicare prescription drugs and encourage competition
among private providers. The amendment would have been part of an
appropriations bill for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human
Services, and Education. Supporters said it would help the aged.
Opponents wanted insurance companies not Medicare to provide drug
benefits. A ``no'' vote limits Medicare benefits and services.

   The House on Monday rejected, 197-207, an amendment to transfer
medical care funding to the Justice Department for lawsuits against
tobacco companies. The measure would have been part of the
Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development
Appropriations bill. Supporters hoped to continue federal lawsuits
against tobacco companies. Opponents said that the amendment would
take needed funding from veterans' medical treatment. A ``no'' vote
stops funds for the Clinton administration to sue the tobacco
industry.

<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: EPA
</P>
<P>
   The House on Wednesday approved, 226-199, a provision to
prohibit the Environmental Protection Agency from identifying areas
with high levels of ozone. The amendment is part of the Departments
of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development
Appropriations bill. Supporters said the measure would protect
communities from the stigma of having a poor air rating. Opponents
argued it would weaken the agency. A ``yes'' vote restricts EPA
programs.

   NEW YORK _ As senior vice president of merchandising at Tiffany
&AMP; Co., Linda Hanson had to be careful when talking about creating a
new design for the Tiffany engagement ring.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the company had been making its trademark ring, with
its famous ``Tiffany setting,'' for 114 years. But Hanson pressed
for a new product, and Tiffany introduced Lucida, billed as ``the
new Tiffany engagement ring,'' last fall. With a square-cut diamond
and sleek setting, it is a far cry from the traditional Tiffany
setting, with a round diamond. The new ring starts at $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   Hanson, who was a math and economics major at Smith College,
worked in the 1980s for Smith Barney, where she eventually became a
vice president in corporate finance. But she was always fascinated
by gems and first became interested in design during her art
history classes at Smith.
</P>
<P>
   After seven years at Smith Barney, she wanted a career change.
She studied at the Gemological Institute of America and joined
Tiffany in 1990, becoming a vice president in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The new ring, several years in the making, is intended to
attract a more adventurous buyer. ``We knew that we needed to
create a new icon in the engagement world,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But making an icon isn't easy. Hanson directed a team of
gemologists, designers and marketers that produced the ring. The
gemologists worked on different ways to cut the stone while
designers worked on creating the band. Then the team made sure that
the cut matched the design of the setting.
</P>
<P>
   The group practiced on real diamonds. As for the scores of
stones that just didn't work, Hanson said many were simply
discarded. ``It sounds kind of weird, because you use actual
diamonds, but that's just a part of research and development,'' she
said.

 &HT;    Fear fuels Amazon plunge
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If Wall Street analysts don't think Amazon.com _ with
one of the strongest brands on the Internet _ can make money, it
doesn't bode well for the rest of the e-commerce landscape.
</P>
<P>
   That bleak scenario sent investors scurrying Friday, when it
seemed nobody on Wall Street had anything good to say about the
Seattle-based retailer, which sells everything from books to
toothpaste and Palm Pilots to 20 million Web shoppers around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com shares dropped nearly 20 percent of their value in
heavy trading Friday, reaching a 52-week low. Shares have tumbled
from a high of $113 six months ago to $33.88 Friday, wiping out $28
billion in value. The stock plummeted on analysts' concerns that
Amazon _ which has yet to turn a profit _ might be facing a bleak
Christmas season and could perhaps run out of cash.
</P>
<P>
   The comments sent up yet another red flag to investors already
skittish about dot-com holdings. Amazon, Yahoo!, America Online and
eBay are considered the ``big four'' companies of the New Economy.
If it appears that one of the biggest and best known online brands
can't make money, then who can?
</P>
<P>
   Mary Meeker, a Morgan Stanley Dean Witter analyst known as the
grand dame of Internet stocks, helped trigger the downturn by
saying on CNBC that she sees potential for ``no upside'' and
``modest downside'' for Amazon until the Christmas season, which
will be ``make or break'' time.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts from Lehman Brothers expressed similar concerns about
Amazon's cash flow and its ability to generate profits during the
second and third quarters. Lehman analysts were concerned that,
despite its 20 million customers and $1.6 billion in revenue for
1999, Amazon had burned through $1.2 billion in cash over the last
five quarters, and still shows no profit. The analysts were worried
the company might run out of operating money and labeled it ``high
risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazon's director of public relations Bill Curry dismissed the
Lehman reports entirely. ``It's pure hogwash. We are asolutely
nowhere near _ put that in boldface letters _ running out of cash.
Anybody who does understand the cash flow dynamics of our business
understands that we are nowhere near running out of cash. ``
</P>
<P>
   Curry said the company ended the first quarter with nearly $1
billion in cash and expects to generate a positive cash flow from
its operations over the coming year.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns about Amazon's financial health surfaced early this
year, when the company posted record sales for 1999 of $1.6
billion, but spent $720 million more than it took in.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Russell Grandinetti, Amazon's director of investor
relations, told the Journal-Constitution that the company's losses
were due to the cost of growing the company, including $300 million
on the company's state-of-the-art distribution centers, one of
which is in Henry County south of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Curry's strongly worded comments Friday were directed at a
report issued by Lehman Brothers analysts Ravi Suria and Stan Oh,
which said: ``Going into what is arguably its most challenging
holiday season, we believe that the combination of negative cash
flow, poor working capital management, and high debt load in a
hyper competitive environment will put the company under extremely
high risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Their words of warning are based on concerns that while Amazon
is one of the world's best known brands in online or offline
retailing, it has been unable to leverage the value of its brand
and stop the ever-increasing flow of red ink.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon has $1.08 billion in cash and is using $115.7 million a
month beyond its revenues, according to data compiled by Bloomberg
News. That means the company could run out of cash in nine months
if it continues spending at the same rate.
</P>
<P>
   However, not all analysts are concerned that Amazon is going to
close its virtual doors.
</P>
<P>
   Miles Russ, senior analyst with Robinson Humphrey in Atlanta
said the stock plunge was an overreaction. ``The dot-coms are so
much out of favor right now that everybody gets twice as nervous
when someone is out there saying something bearish about the big
four. It's dot-com paranoia magnified.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he was unconcerned about sluggish second and third
quarters for the online retailer. ``It's a seasonal business after
all,'' Russ said.
</P>
<P>
   The analyst also dismissed rumors that Amazon.com founder Jeff
Bezos might consider selling or merging his company with a
traditional ``brick and mortar'' retailer such as Federated
Department Stores, owners of Bloomingdale's, Macy's, Burdine's and
Rich's stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Bezos would be interested in merging with a
bricks and mortar company,'' Russ said. ``Although I do believe
that lots of brick and mortar companies would like to get in with
them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Of all the pure Internet retailers, Amazon has the best
following and has the highest likelihood of being classified with
brick and mortar retailers,'' said David Herskovits, a partner with
Deloitte and Touche consulting firm. ``But there's still a lot of
future for Amazon and there's still a story to be told.''
</P>
<P>
   Russ says Amazon's prospects are still good and the company
insists it will cut back on its spending, although details of its
planned fiscal prudence are sketchy. ``The company is going to
survive,'' Russ said.
</P>
<P>
   Russ contends Amazon's distribution centers could turn out to be
a very valuable asset. ``People have to recognize that (Amazon) has
hard assets, including distribution centers with huge capacity and
that's worth something. They could use it as collateral for any
kind of financing. Amazon.com is not just some little dot.com with
just a Web site.''

   CLOONEY-FILM (Burbank, Calif.) _ The story of George Clooney's
rocky though successful rise from television bit player to NBC's
smash hit ``E.R.,'' and, most recently, to movie stardom, reveals
an actor who can be as confrontational as he is affable, as tough
as he is thin-skinned, who often really did do it his way. By Dana
Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   LONDON-SUMMER-THEATER (London) _ Americans still patriotically
smarting at the number of British prizewinners in this year's Tony
Awards need only visit the British capital itself to find a salve
for sore pride. If the New York theater sometimes looks a bit like
Shaftesbury-Avenue-by-the-Hudson, there are parts of London this
summer that might be Broadway-on-the-Thames or even
Hollywood-Near-the-Atlantic. By Benedict Nightingale.
</P>
<P>
   JITNEY-THEATER (New York) _ On the surface, the play deals with
the social and economic troubles of the time through the impending
forced closing of the car service business, which will put the
drivers out of jobs. But as with all meaningful plays, ``Jitney''
operates on deeper levels as well. In the end, it is a play about
the meaning of love. By Wilborn Hampton.

   BACH-MUSIC (Undated) _ On an anniversary or in any other year,
there can be few musicological questions more pressing than that of
how Bach's music sounded when it was being performed for the first
time, week after week, under the composer's direction in St.
Thomas' Church in Leipzig. Light on this subject is now being shed
by one of the leading practitioners of early music, Andrew Parrott,
in performances, recordings and a book: ``The Essential Bach
Choir'' (University of Rochester Press). By Paul Griffiths.

   GILBERTO-LATIN-MUSIC (Undated) _ What Latin America struggles to

Joao Gilberto. By Bernard Holland.

   COUNTRY-MUSIC-NATIVE (Undated) _ For those in the cities of the
north who like country music, it is music they like, not music they
live or grew up to. And it's definitely not the country music real
Southerners listen to. By Neil Strauss.

   COUNTRY-MUSIC-CONVERT (Undated) _ New York Times reporter Peter
Applebome says that when it comes to music these days, for him it's

<P>
   BALLETS-RUSSES (New Orleans) _ Everyone kissed everyone else and
the kisses were wonderful to behold. People kissed on lecture
platforms, in a hotel lobby, at an art gallery, at receptions.
There were delighted cries of, ``My dear, I haven't seen you for 50
years!'' And the remark was not hyperbole. Happy tears flowed like
champagne. Champagne also flowed. All this happened at the Ballets
Russes celebration, an extraordinary event that took place here
June 1-4. It honored the three great companies with Ballets Russes
in their names: Sergei Diaghilev's pioneering Ballets Russes and
the successor troupes of Col. W. de Basil and Sergei Denham. By
Jack Anderson.

   SIDEKICK-TV (Undated) _ It is the day after his last appearance
on ``Late Night With Conan O'Brien'' _ a day that a more
predictable type would probably describe as ``the first day of the
rest of my life.'' Nothing so shopworn comes from Andy Richter. He
takes stock in his own way, doing a kind of ``In the Year 2000''
routine about where he is and where he is going. James Barron
examines the death of the late-night sidekick.
</P>
<P>
   WILKERSON-ANTIQUES (Undated) _ John Wilkerson was 7 when he dug
up a shiny stone arrowhead at a water hole near the family's small
ranch in Elko, Nev. Collecting arrowheads remained a passion
throughout his youth, spent among the children of ranchers and
Shoshone Indians, and much later, when he returned from college to
work summers as a cowboy and do research on the economics of
raising cattle in the West. Yet he never dreamed that in finding
that arrowhead at the water hole he had taken his first step toward
becoming, 50 years later, the president of the Museum of American
Folk Art in New York. By Rita Reif.

   ARCHITECTURE-GLOBAL (Undated) _ The Surrealist critique remains
the most useful method we have for revealing the values at work in

   MICROSOFT-FUTURE (Redmond, Wash.) _ ``We are on the brink of a
new computing revolution.'' ``As big a transition as from DOS to

possibly miss the point at the Microsoft Corp.'s big media event
last week, the captions in the slide show and demonstrations were
all designed to convey the notion that the company's strategy for
the future would be, in the words of another Internet company's
ubiquitous ads, ``big _ really big.'' By Sam Howe Verhovek.
</P>
<P>
   RETIRE-PROPOSALS (Undated) _ Few issues point up the ideological
gulf between the likely major-party presidential candidates more
clearly than their very different approaches to inducing Americans
to save more money for retirement. Vice President Al Gore proposes
that the government provide a subsidy of as much as $3 for every $1
that you kick in to your retirement kitty, a new entitlement
program designed to favor the relative have-nots. George W. Bush
will probably endorse a plan under which the kitty will be fattened
with taxes that currently helps finance Social Security. What is
remarkable, however, is what the two sides now have in common: a
recognition that the electorate wants the long-term adequacy of
Social Security to be debated instead of avoided. By Robert D.
Hershey.

Jeffrey Pfeffer and Robert Sutton have studied the ways of business

   BIZ-ENTERPRISE (San Francisco) _ Enterprise Application
Integration software firms are the opposite of the Blue Chip
Technology companies that investors have been buying since the

records and no earnings. But companies like Vignette, Vitria,
Webmethods, Tibco and Crossworlds also have the high octane growth
that can justify their valuations. And they are selling for less
than half their highs. By Lawrence M. Fisher.

   &UR; COMMENTARY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ECON-COLUMN (Undated) _ The United States seems to have tired of
using the fruits of American labor as a weapon in global politics.
In the span of a month, Congress eliminated China's annual trade
review and President Clinton eased economic sanctions against North
Korea. The State Department even dropped the term ``rogue state''
from its diplomatic lexicon: Libya, Iraq and Syria are now simply
``states of concern.'' Could the 38-year embargo on trade with Cuba
be next? By Joseph Kahn.
</P>
<P>
   MIDSTREAM-COLUMN (Undated) _ As baby boomers, we are getting a
reputation. We take heat for our questionable cell-phone habits,
the big trucks we drive and our overall obsession with money. Now
investment advisers are shaking their heads over how we invest. We
are, they say, incredibly risk-prone and oblivious to the lessons
of history. We know that, of course, and it seems that many of us
don't care. But not all of us. By James Schembari.

   DRESSING-ROOMS (Undated) _ You are standing with your pants
around your ankles when a stranger pulls back a curtain and says,
``Peekaboo!'' You have been locked out in a public place wearing a
single black sock and a cocktail dress with a price tag hanging off
the side. You are standing in your underwear when the woman your ex
dumped you for strides imperiously into the room. Pop quiz: Are you
1) trapped in a Freudian nightmare, 2) a candidate for a case study
in ``The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders'' or
3) out shopping. The answer, obviously, is 3. And the source of
your deep-rooted anxiety is that perennial bane of the shopper, the

castaways against one another as they vote each other off their

even jail. By Bob Morris.

most truly chic women know how to dramatize their assets. Vamping
to reinforce the point, he pulled back his honey-streaked hair,

   ANTI-INTELLECTUALISM-REVIEW (Washington) _ These days, it seems,
a candidate's brainpower could be as much a political liability as
an asset. By Richard L. Berke.
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET-PRIVACY-REVIEW (Undated) _ As reports of electronic
security breaches and privacy lapses roll in with increasing
frequency, it has become almost an article of faith among computer
security experts that the radical, global effort that could make
the Internet more secure will not happen until a major catastrophe
strikes. By Amy Harmon.

   INDIAN-CLAIMS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Written off as powerless and
invisible 50 years ago, American Indians have been winning back
small but significant chunks of land during a time of general
renaissance for many of the tribes. For the last 30 years, a new
generation of tribal lawyers has blown the dust off ancient
treaties to find that the deeds signed by kings and presidents
still have remarkable power in American courts. By Timothy Egan.

   DEFENSE-LAWYERS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Incompetent defense
attorneys.

<P>
   WINE-INTERNET-REVIEW (Undated) _ Wine lovers have been surfing
the web, finding wines that interest them, and then ordering them
via credit card. There is also a thriving direct shipment business,
with wines ordered by phone or e-mail and shipped in small case
lots, bypassing both wholesalers and retailers. And, of course,
state tax collectors, as well. By Frank J. Prial.
</P>
<P>
   RELIGION-SCHOOLS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Last week, the Supreme Court
held that student-led prayers at high school football games are
unconstitutional. Largely overshadowed by the headline-making
decision was another important case concerning separation of church
and state in an educational setting. By a 6-3 vote, the high court
let stand a lower court ruling in Tangipahoa Parish Board of
Education vs. Freiler, which barred a Louisiana school board from
requiring that the Darwinian theory of evolution only be taught
with a disclaimer mentioning the Biblical story of creation. By
Thomas Vinciguerra.

advanced medicines, developed through billions of dollars of
research costs, available to those who cannot pay. By Donald G.
McNeil Jr.
</P>
<P>
   POVERTY-REVIEW (Washington) _ These days, only orange-haired
college drop-outs and Third World dictators believe capitalism is
not the high road to a better world. But at the World Bank, the
high church of development economics, a widening schism about how
to fight poverty is sending ripples around the world. By Joseph
Kahn.

<P>
   _ Also moving in the `i' category:
</P>

   IRAN-REVIEW (Washington) _ Iranian politics aren't quite so
simple as a zero-sum game between dueling clerics. Rather, they
involve a collection of overlapping power centers operating with
varying degrees of authority, independence and success. By Elaine
Sciolino.
</P>
<P>
   ROGUE-STATES-REVIEW (Pyongyang, North Korea) _ ``Rogue states''
is not the first diplomatic appellation to fall out of use, of
course. The end of the Cold War spelled doom for a raft of
nasty-sounding labels, like Iron Curtain, Evil Empire and Red
China. But Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's move appeared to
be the first deliberate effort to change the diplomatic lexicon in
pursuit of foreign policy goals. By Steven Lee Myers.
</P>
<P>
   GREECE-REVIEW (Undated) _ Greece is not quite on the verge of a
nervous breakdown, but it is a society where national identity is
being tugged in opposite directions. By Alessandra Stanley.

 &HT;    Orlando's chills and thrills better all the time
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, June 25.
 &HT;    By Doug Hamilton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO _ Bigger bangs. Zappier zaps. Loopier loops. Really real
virtual reality. At Central Florida's major theme parks, they all
mean the same thing: the never-ending search for a new wow.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing they're only as good as their latest thrill ride, the
parks have recently introduced a spate of new or revamped
attractions. With Kraken, a high-speed loop coaster that opened
earlier this month, Sea World hopes to borrow some of the good buzz
from the wildly popular Incredible Hulk ride at Universal's Islands
of Adventure. Eyeing the long lines for Buzz Lightyear's Space
Ranger Spin at Disney's Magic Kingdom, Universal Studios has fired
back with an interactive alien hunt of its own, Men in Black Alien
Attack.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outdone, Disney is offering a new gloss on some old
favorites: A 3D, virtual reality version of the classic Pirates of
the Caribbean opened this month at DisneyQuest; and a
reconstructed, sonically improved version of the stunning Indiana
Jones stunt show has debuted at Disney-MGM Studios.
</P>
<P>
   We recently visited the parks and gave the new rides the wow
test, grading each on a scale from 1 (ho-hum) to 10 (awesome).
Here's how they stacked up:
</P>
<P>
   Kraken _ Sea World Orlando
</P>
<P>
   Wow grade: 7
</P>
<P>
   This extra-twisty ``floorless'' coaster is the aging marine
park's latest attempt _ joining the Journey to Atlantis water flume
and the Wild Arctic flight simulator _ to appeal to a younger, more
thrill-thirsty crowd. With its 144-foot initial drop and seven
loops, including two vertical revolutions and a zero-gravity roll,
it's certainly gasp-inducing. But some riders felt that it paled
next to other rides, especially the Incredible Hulk coaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is, it's in the middle of Orlando, so it's got so
much competition,'' said Wendie Pate, 27, who had traveled from
London with her husband, Steve, 29, to visit several Central
Florida theme parks. Even though the couple had just disembarked
from their third straight spin on Kraken, they pronounced it ``not
as good'' as Universal's rival coaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first drop is really something, but you know it's
coming,'' said Wendie. Whereas, she noted, the Hulk's
out-of-nowhere speed surge ``really takes you by surprise. On a
scale of 1 to 10, I'd give Kraken an 8 and the Hulk an 11.'' We
agree, and dock Kraken an extra point for its bland aquamarine
color scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Men in Black Alien Attack
</P>
<P>
   _ Universal Studios
</P>
<P>
   Wow grade: 5
</P>
<P>
   Based on the 1997 hit movie starring Will Smith, this flashy
interactive ride opened in April and instantly became one of
Universal Studios' most popular attractions. But the interminable
lines _ some guests have waited two hours or longer _ seem out of
proportion to the modest charms of what is essentially a glorified
video game.
</P>
<P>
   After strolling past cute animatronic dioramas depicting scenes
from the movie, riders board a two-tiered car equipped with laser
zappers. The car winds through a garishly lit chamber packed with
alien targets that spin, swoop and hop. Riders earn points by
shooting them with the lasers _ enough points and you're deemed
ready to join Smith as a full-time Men in Black agent.
</P>
<P>
   Though far from disappointing, the ride is too similar to others
to be a top-notch wow. It's very reminiscent of Buzz Lightyear's
Space Ranger Spin at the Magic Kingdom, and one rider dismissed it
as ``Mr. Toad's Wild Ride with guns.'' The long lines further lower
its grade, though that will likely change when Universal unveils a
ride reservation system similar to Disney's FastPass next month.
</P>
<P>
   Pirates of the Caribbean: Battle
</P>
<P>
   for Buccaneer Gold _ DisneyQuest
</P>
<P>
   Wow grade: 8
</P>
<P>
   There are glorified video games and then there are glorified
video games: This clever offering, which opened Wednesday at the
five-story interactive attraction in the Downtown Disney
entertainment, dining and shopping mall, puts participants inside a
virtual reality battle with pirate ships. Donning 3-D viewing
helmets, players stand on the bow of a ship, which literally rocks
in the ``waves.'' One player steers the ship while up to four
others man cannons and plug away at video vessels on a giant curved
screen.
</P>
<P>
   Sink one with a virtual reality cannon blast and you're awarded
a chest full of doubloons, but be careful of the toothy sea
monsters, which may take a bite out of the boat.
</P>
<P>
   While the novelty of virtual reality rides wore off years ago,
this multisensory experience puts a fresh spin on the genre. Even
so, it still cag stunt effects needn't worry: Every fight, fire and
flipping truck is still here _ only the choreography has been
slightly altered.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a hit, we didn't want to change much,'' said
producer Joe Kivett, on hand for the first return show, along with
500 invited guests named Jones. But Kivett dubbed the sonic effects
``greatly improved. Pay attention to the way the wind whips across
the speakers during the first scene.''
</P>
<P>
   We did, and we could swear we felt a hot gust as the audio track
introduced the show's Indiana Jones double, Ed Knauf. And when
Knauf was later chased by that famous rolling boulder, we knew we
were in the hands of the best Disney dream-makers.
</P>
<P>
   COMING ATTRACTIONS
</P>
<P>
   The quest for more wows continues in the upcoming months.
Islands of Adventure will unveil two kiddie rides in early July:
Storm Force Acceleration, based on characters from the X-Men
comics, simulates a thunderstorm with light and sound; Flying
Unicorn is a gentle roller coaster that travels through faux cloud
banks. The park will also debut two new shows on July 2 _ the
sports extravaganza ``Xtreme Xventure'' and the interactive comedy
``Bullwinkle for President.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney is keeping things hopping with the return of last
summer's hit, ``The Best of Michael Flatley's Lord of the Dance''
at Epcot. The 30-minute Celtic stepping performance runs through
Aug. 26. And SongMaker, another new interactive attraction now open
at DisneyQuest, invites guests to step into a sound booth and
create a tune with supplied lyrics and beats, which they then have
the option of purchasing.
</P>
<P>
   What will be the next theme park thrill? Stay tuned, and fasten
your seat belts ...

 &HT;    In Atlanta and around the world, the Salvation Army marches
forth to do good deeds and save souls
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   With a background in law enforcement, Ted Owenby is used to
wearing uniforms. In a few days, he will be wearing a new one _
that of an officer in the Salvation Army.
</P>
<P>
   Owenby and his wife, Susan, enlisted as ``soldiers'' in the Army
in 1993 after an applicant for a driver's license at the Ocala,
Fla., licensing bureau where Owenby worked invited them to a
Salvationist service.
</P>
<P>
   Like many people, ``I didn't even know the Salvation Army was a
church,'' Owenby said. ``I knew it as a social service
organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, at 50, the Owenbys are the oldest members of a class
graduating June 29 from the College for Officers' Training, the
Salvation Army's seminary in south Atlanta for the Southern states.
They will go on to be pastors in a local Salvation Army church,
called a corps. As they cross the stage at their graduation
ceremony, or commissioning service, they will learn along with the
audience where they will be sent.
</P>
<P>
   Swapping a cop's uniform for that of a Salvationist feels
different, Owenby said. ``This one causes you to feel humble. The
other one didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Owenbys and other Salvationists stand out among casually
clothed crowds _ sometimes being mistaken for hotel bell captains
or airline pilots _ they will blend in next week.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty thousand of their brothers and sisters in uniform from
around the world will gather in Atlanta Wednesday through July 2
for the Army's International Millennial Congress. The meeting, to
be held in the Georgia World Congress Center and Philips Arena, is
only the eighth in the 135-year history of the Army and the first
to be held outside Salvation Army headquarters in London. It is
expected to be the largest Army event ever.
</P>
<P>
   In a visit to Atlanta last year, the supreme commanding officer
of the 1 million-member Army worldwide, Gen. John Gowans, said,
``After all these years, it's time it left London, don't you
think?''
</P>
<P>
   As home to the 1996 Olympic Games, ``I think Atlanta's the right
place for Salvationists to get together,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta is already a major center for the Salvation Army in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to being the site for the seminary, the city is
headquarters for 15 states in an arc from Maryland to Texas, one of
four territorial centers in the United States. The Army has nine
``corps community centers'' or churches in metro Atlanta, with a
total of 1,312 members. The temple, at North Druid Hills Road and
I-85, is the site of many officers' weddings and funerals.
</P>
<P>
   But even in Atlanta, many people are ignorant about the Army
beyond its brass bands, disaster relief efforts and Christmas bell
ringers.
</P>
<P>
   Society's unwanted
</P>
<P>
   The Salvation Army is a Christian denomination with mainline
Protestant worship and Wesleyan theology that says eternal life
through Jesus Christ is available to everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Founder William Booth, a Methodist minister, and a group of his
associates founded the Army out of a mission agency in England in
the 1860s. Its primary focus was to reach the unchurched and
unwanted, such as prostitutes, beggars and drunks. Realizing it was
hard to interest people in religion when they were cold, hungry and
thirsty, Booth offered ``soup, soap and salvation.''
</P>
<P>
   From its beginning the Army was distinctive.
</P>
<P>
   Booth, described as a rather self-righteous man with a passion
for order, saw the military structure as a way to continue his own
control of his followers while deploying them wherever they were
needed. Even today, the international Army is very local in its
efforts to meet the specific needs of a unique community, said
spokesman Lt. Col. Tom Jones of U.S. headquarters in Alexandria,
Va.
</P>
<P>
   Booth found the imagery of the war of good vs. evil easily
understandable to the uneducated classes he was trying to reach.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the military identity evolved:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Even ``soldiers'' in the Army, or regular church members, may
wear uniforms. Officers are clergy who are identifiable by their
red trim, and they move up through the ranks by seniority or
appointment beginning with lieutenant.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  To join the Army is to sign the ``Articles of War,'' which
outline the denomination's doctrine and include a promise to
refrain from alcohol, tobacco, gambling, pornography and the
occult.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Local congregational leaders, comparable to a vestry, session
or board of deacons in other denominations, are called ``local
officers.'' Their chairman is the ``corps sergeant major.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Army's newspaper is called The War Cry.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  To give a tithe or offering in a Salvationist meeting is to
``fire a cartridge.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Brass bands accompany singing at worship.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Army has its own salute _ the index finger of the right
hand pointed toward heaven.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Salvationists who die are ``promoted to Glory,'' in Army
language.
</P>
<P>
   The military terminology is based on the teachings of St. Paul,
author of many of the Epistles in the New Testament, who wrote
about Christians as good soldiers and urged early followers to
``put on the breastplate of faith and love, and for a helmet the
hope of salvation.''
</P>
<P>
   Women preachers
</P>
<P>
   Women, beginning with Booth's wife, Catherine, were always
permitted to preach and hold leadership positions. Two women have
led the Army _ Booth's daughter Evangeline and, most recently, Gen.
Eva Burrows, who served in the 1980s and early 1990s and is
expected to attend the congress in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Booth helped to convince her reluctant husband that
women should be equal in the church, according to Roy Hattersley, a
British politician and writer who wrote ``Blood and Fire, William
and Catherine Booth and Their Salvation Army'' (Doubleday, 1999,
$26.95).
</P>
<P>
   Catherine, as described by Hattersley, was both an effective
preacher and a more astute student of theology than her husband,
who operated more by instinct than scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   In the Army, husband and wife are always the same rank, although
they may have different jobs. They are paid one stipend to share,
and are furnished housing by the Army. They move only their
families, clothes and personal goods.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Salvation Army is what it is today because of
Catherine Booth, William's wife,'' said Jessica Swyers. ``And I
don't say that just because I'm a woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Swyers, 24, and her husband, David, 26, will be graduating with
the Owenbys from officer training next week. David Swyers said he
finds the role of women in the Army to be ``special'' and ``very
biblical.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All through the New Testament, you find women who held
churches in their homes,'' he said. ``I think of Jessica as my
equal and my partner. What better person to have as your equal and
partner than your best friend and your wife?''
</P>
<P>
   Family roots
</P>
<P>
   Both David and Jessica can trace their family lines back six
generations in the Army; both are the offspring of Army officers.
</P>
<P>
   But they were reluctant to tell each other when they felt called
by God to the full-time ministry. Both had decided as teenagers
that being Army officers was the last thing they wanted to do.
</P>
<P>
   David was teaching and Jessica was considering a career in the
funeral industry when both felt the need to enter the ministry. But
they were seriously dating and neither wanted to make a choice
between their relationship and the ministry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I could truly be happy if I had just forgotten
my calling and married somebody who didn't want to be an officer,''
Jessica Swyers said. ``I don't think I would have fulfilled what
God wanted me to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Their goals as Army officers are the Army's goals, said David
Swyers. ``We want to make a difference. We want to leave the world
better than we found it. And we want to lead as many people to
Christ as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Expanding roles
</P>
<P>
   As the Swyers enter their Army career, Majs. Dalton and Casey
Cunningham will be taking a new step in theirs.
</P>
<P>
   Dalton Cunningham, 48, has been named commissioner of the Army
in Georgia after heading the army in metro Atlanta since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In almost three decades as officers, the Cunninghams have
ministered around the South, from opening a community center in
Charlotte, to persuading a Ku Klux Klansman in Alabama to burn his
sheet, to managing youth ministry in Baltimore and Texas, to
coordinating a major building campaign in Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   They were 19 _ she a Salvationist from birth, he a former
Baptist _ when they felt the call to sell their home and furniture,
quit their jobs and enter seminary in August 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Army doctrine is ``very plain'' about how Salvationists should
live out the practice of their faith, said Dalton Cunningham.
</P>
<P>
   A sacrificial life
</P>
<P>
   He cites one difference between the Army and the Methodism from
which it sprang. The Army does not offer sacraments such as baptism
or Communion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Salvation is simply by grace,'' he said. ``There's no other
requirement.''

   And the bread and wine of the Last Supper, offered as a
sacrament in most Christian churches, is not regarded as necessary.
But the Salvationist is expected to live a sacrificial life,
Cunningham said.
</P>
<P>
   He quotes a Salvationist hymn: ``My life must be Christ's broken
bread, My love his outpoured wine, A cup o'erfilled, a table spread
beneath his name and sign, That other souls, refreshed and fed, May
share his life through mine.''

FOR BATTERED INSURERS, A TIMELY TURNABOUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, June 25)  
 By JOSEPH B. TREASTER

<P>
   While technology stocks have been careening wildly, some ugly
ducklings in the insurance industry appear to be transforming
themselves into market darlings.
</P>
<P>
   The companies that sell insurance on cars, houses and
businesses, a decidedly unglamorous business, had been sputtering
under the strain of poor earnings, in large part a result of
natural disasters like Hurricane Floyd, and of rising interest
rates since the middle of last year. Their stocks took a real
beating in the first two and a half months of 2000 as technology
stocks were rising sharply. But when technology shares began
selling off in mid-March, the insurers rebounded.
</P>
<P>
   There is little doubt that the insurance stocks had been
oversold by many measures. Many still look relatively cheap when
compared with their peaks of a year or so ago. In addition, signs
of a slowing economy suggest that interest rates may begin to level
off, good news for the group because higher rates can translate
into smaller profits. Even more important, insurers are beginning
to nudge up prices, which also bodes well for profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The property-casualty insurers had been among the most
disfavored stocks on Wall Street,'' said Robert P. Hartwig, the
chief economist at the Insurance Information Institute, an industry
group in New York, adding that some had dropped below book value.
``But since the dot-com shipwreck, people have been looking to put
their money in companies that are actually making a profit. And the
insurance stocks have been among the greatest values on Wall
Street.''
</P>
<P>
   As of Friday, the technology-heavy Nasdaq index was down 5.5
percent for the year, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's property-casualty
stock index was basically flat. Since March 10, the insurance index
has gained 38.3 percent while the Nasdaq, despite its rally since
May 23, is off 23.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In general, rising interest rates dampen insurance stock prices
along with those of other financial services companies. So the
Federal Reserve's short-term interest rate increases, which began
in the middle of last year, have naturally been a drag on the
group's performance. But with insurance stocks well above their
March lows, investors seem to be saying that the economy is
beginning to slow down _ and that the Fed may be nearly done
raising rates.
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks of many types have been picking up. But Alice
Schroeder, an analyst at PaineWebber, says property-casualty stocks
stand out because they are less sensitive to economic developments
_ many people have to buy insurance whether or not prices are
rising _ and ``the fundamentals of these companies are actually
improving.''
</P>
<P>
   Auto insurers are a case in point. Shares of the Progressive
Corp. closed on Friday at $77.875, up 58.1 percent from their 2000
lows on March 13, while those of the Hartford Financial Services
Group closed at $53.3125, up 81.5 percent from their low on the
same day.
</P>
<P>
   Ace, the international insurer based in Bermuda, has risen 83
percent from its March nadir, to $26.875. The St. Paul Companies, a
big commercial insurance group, is up 60.9 percent from its low on
March 8, to $35, and Allstate, a leader in auto and homeowner
coverage, is up 34.5 percent, to $23.875.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the run-up, the property-casualty stocks may have room
to move higher. At the beginning of last year, for example,
Progressive traded at more than twice its current price. Other
stocks are well below their 1999 highs too. ``It may not be the
first inning of this game,'' said Doug Cliggott, the United States
equities strategist for J.P. Morgan Securities. ``But I don't think
it's beyond the third inning. It's still a very attractive point to
get in.''
</P>
<P>
   Some fund managers agree. ``I think there's a long ways to go, a
lot of upside, plenty of potential in these stock prices,'' said
Jeff Morris, who manages the $1.3 billion Invesco Financial
Services fund. Noting that the stocks have moved away from their
recent highs, he added that he ``wouldn't read too much into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Others sounded more cautious. Schroeder says some prices of a
year or two ago were historical highs that may be difficult to
overtake anytime soon. Although many of the stocks may have topped
out, she said, there is still money to be made on Ace; XL Ltd.,
another big Bermuda insurer; two of her favorites, AIG and
Berkshire Hathaway; and the two biggest commercial brokers, Marsh &AMP;
McLennan and Aon.
</P>
<P>
   After declining for nearly a decade, prices for commercial
insurance, which offers protection to corporations for most
everything from shareholder suits to plant explosions, are starting
to show signs of increasing. Some of the biggest auto insurers,
including Progressive and Geico, the Berkshire Hathaway unit, have
also begun raising their prices after two years of declines across
the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can make a pretty good case that the insurance cycle is
turning in a more positive direction,'' Cliggott said.
</P>
<P>
   New markets are opening, too, Hartwig said, citing China and
India and a whole field of coverage devoted to cyberspace problems.
A handful of big insurers are entering that field with policies
covering loss of data and damage from viruses. &QL;

FROM THE BIGGEST (MICROSOFT), SOMETHING REALLY BIG (INTERACTIVE
SERVICES) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, June 25)  
 By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

   REDMOND, Wash. _ ``We are on the brink of a new computing
revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As big a transition as from DOS to Windows.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft's Net bet is boldest yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Lest anyone possibly miss the point at the Microsoft Corp.'s big
media event last week, the captions in the slide show and
demonstrations were all intended to convey the notion that the
company's strategy for the future would be, in the words of another
Internet company's ubiquitous ads, ``big _ really big.''
</P>
<P>
   To add a little more emphasis, Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman,
told the assembled analysts and reporters from around the globe,
``You could say it's a bet-the-company thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Under continuing assault in its antitrust battle with the
government, Microsoft held the event not only to offer a glimpse of
some new products _ including software for talking computers and
``interactive paper'' tablets _ but also to suggest that it had a
much broader vision of the future.
</P>
<P>
   The company, judged a predatory monopolist by a federal judge,
took pains to paint it as a friendly future in which it would work
with competitors and partners alike to make the Internet as easy to
use as a television or a telephone.
</P>
<P>
   In time, Microsoft said, it would essentially transform the
heart of its revenue base from packaged software to subscriber-paid
``interactive services.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether consumers, analysts and investors will wind up going
where the company wants them to go remains to be seen. There's
still the antitrust case, which the company's top officials tried
to acknowledge with a bit of roundabout humor.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's chief executive, Steven A. Ballmer, noted that the
event itself was delayed three weeks to avoid coinciding with Judge
Thomas Penfield Jackson's ruling that he wanted to split the
company in two. ``For me, the last three weeks made me feel almost
like a caged animal,'' he told the crowd. ``I wanted to come out of
the closet and tell everyone what we've been up to! But, `back in
the closet,' the PR people said. You really don't want to do this
on that day.'''
</P>
<P>
   So, now that the day for ``this'' has arrived, what is
Microsoft's vision for its next generation of services, which the
company calls ``.NET'' (pronounced dot-net)?
</P>
<P>
   In essence, according to the demonstrations at the company's
conference center here on Thursday, Microsoft.NET is about making
what is often called a ``cloud'' of services on the Internet, to be
accessed by a range of personal devices, including hand-held
``tablets'' and organizers, cell phones, cameras and whatever else
inventors dream up.
</P>
<P>
   It promises a world of incredibly instant gratification. In one
video, called ``Family Vacation,'' the Microsoft presentation
depicted an entire trip being arranged in moments. Dinner
reservations at a fancy restaurant are made instantly via a two-way
camera link to the maitre d'. He greets the caller on screen and
beckons to the table where Mom and Dad might be seated with Mom's
parents, who are then messaged to make sure that the restaurant is
suitable. Of course, the smiling grandparents instantly message
back.
</P>
<P>
   During the vacation, the family makes an outing to the zoo. For
some reason, the grandparents don't go, but they can share in the
pleasure in real time: When the family comes up with an especially
nice picture on their digital camera, they send it, wirelessly, to
the grandparents, who are watching television at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, look at that!'' Grandmother beams, so taken with it that
she pushes a button and zaps it into a frame that sits on a table
by the sofa.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's world would also let people talk to their computers,
and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you want to do now?'' the female-voiced computer asks
a sales manager in another demonstration. He asks, ``How's the
market doing today?'' and she _ or it? _ after verifying if he
wants to know about the Dow or Nasdaq or both, returns in seconds
with the latest report. Then he asks to schedule a meeting with a
colleague later in the week. ``Let me see if you are both available
at that time,'' his computer tells him, then schedules the meeting
into their calendars.
</P>
<P>
   Ballmer said the company had dedicated more than half of its
roughly $4 billion budget for research and development to the new
strategy and would keep spending huge sums on it.
</P>
<P>
   For the strategy to really succeed, of course, hardware vendors
and software developers will have to follow Microsoft's lead. But
given the languid response to the company's push into consumer
electronics, such an entourage is by no means guaranteed. Many
other companies, from America Online to cellular providers, hope to
provide the ubiquitous Internet connection.
</P>
<P>
   While some of the products Microsoft talked about this week will
be rolled out within months, others probably will not show up for
years or a decade, if ever. Still, many analysts credited the
company with laying out a strong vision.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy has already created some interesting
strange-bedfellow alliances.
</P>
<P>
   Loudcloud Inc., described by its founder as a ``software power
grid in the sky'' that can help businesses in all sorts of ways,
said last week that it would be Microsoft's software development
partner for a number of Internet services. The founder in question?
Marc Andreeson, whose Netscape famously did battle with Microsoft
in the ``browser war'' that is at the heart of the antitrust case.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you asked me six months ago whether I'd be partnering with
Marc Andreeson,'' Ballmer allowed, ``I would have thought that was
pretty strange.'' &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: KINDNESS JUST MIGHT UNRAVEL HIM 
</HEADLINE>
   By IRA BERKOW    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is time for New Yorkers to turn the other cheek, to embrace
with open arms, to bestow a Big Apple welcome to John Loy Rocker,
that renowned deep thinker and man of generous insights.
</P>
<P>
   While city officials fear that an appearance by Rocker with
Atlanta on Thursday, when the Braves open a series at Shea Stadium,
could result in mayhem, it is to the benefit of Mets fans to
perform acts of kindness and civility to the left-handed relief
pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in many circles, opinion on John Rocker is divided. Some
believe him to be a moron. Others think that he is an idiot. It's a
free country, and their analyses cannot be dismissed out of hand.
After all, anyone, as Rocker did, who paints an entire city _ and
entire subway cars, for that matter _ with one broad, incriminating
brush, may conceivably not be a candidate for the chair at Harvard
for the study of enlightenment.
</P>
<P>
   But whether it's necessary to provide, as Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
said he would, 450 to 500 police officers at Shea for the series _
in contrast to the normal complement of 45 _ is disturbing in more
ways than one. And whether it's in the best interests of all
concerned to construct a fence and plywood roof to the visitors'
bullpen to protect Rocker from rowdiness, as the Mets are planning,
is another point that should be thought through.
</P>
<P>
   The contention here is that if Mets fans truly want the best for
their team, they should not greet Rocker by hurling boos and
batteries at him for having made his now infamous pronouncement in
a December issue of Sports Illustrated, which included: ``Imagine
having to take the 7 train, looking like you're in Beirut next to
some kid with purple hair, next to some queer with AIDS, right next
to some dude who got out of jail for the fourth time, right next to
some 20-year-old mom with four kids. It's depressing.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not you happen to be, say, some kid with purple hair,
those statements by Rocker as well as sundry other xenophobic,
homophobic and hirsute phobic remarks, may certainly be construed
as offensive. Yet the record shows that ill treatment is no way to
behave toward a man who could help the Mets, a team in profound
need of assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Look what happened on Wednesday night, for example. Rocker was
brought into the game against the Chicago Cubs in the ninth inning,
with the Braves behind by 3-1. He came running full bore from the
bullpen, as is his wacky wont. The hometown crowd at Turner Field
of 44,698 gave him a rousing ovation. Gentleman John proceeded to
walk four batters, hit another, allowed one hit, had no strikeouts
and gave up five runs as the Braves went down to an 8-1 defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, Mets fans, that after Rocker's suspension in the early
part of this season for his intemperate remarks, he returned to
roaring cheers. He was then so thrilled and excited, apparently, by
this acceptance, that he pitched his way to the minors, unable to
get the ball over the plate. Only recently, after injuries to their
bullpen, did the Braves reluctantly recall Rocker. His earned run
average before Friday night's game stood at a gaudy 5.85.
</P>
<P>
   If you are a Mets batsman, this is a man you would be crazy not
to want to face.
</P>
<P>
   The genesis of Rocker's remarks to Sports Illustrated came while
the Braves were beating the Mets in the National League
Championship Series last October. Rocker pitched in all six games,
generally in tight situations. He gave up three hits in six and
two-thirds innings, walked just two and struck out nine. He had two
saves in the Braves' four victories. And an ERA of 0.00. He said
that Mets fans had spat on him, threw batteries at him and visited
him with an assortment of other ungallant deeds. And then he went
out and destroyed Flushing's darlings.
</P>
<P>
   It's obvious that the worse you act toward Rocker, the better he
pitches. And the nicer you treat him, the lousier he plays. It
doesn't take an expert in quantum physics to figure out what Mets
fans must do to the good ol' boy Rocker.
</P>
<P>
   He had said recently, maybe adding insult to injury, that when
he got to New York he was going to take the No. 7 train to Shea.
I'd give him a seat.
</P>
<P>
   At the ballpark, I'd toss him a bouquet of flowers, the way they
do opera singers and triple-lutz skaters. Lull him into a sense of
bliss. Gentleness softens the soul and, more important, enfeebles
the sinews in the soup bone.
</P>
<P>
   I'd probably stop short of a ticker-tape parade when Rocker
comes to town. But if he pitches like a bum, I'd reconsider. If he
performs like a champ again, then I'd go to Plan B: rotten
tomatoes. &QL;

CHINA PUSHING TO MODERNIZE ITS MILITARY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ China is modernizing its armed forces to counter
military threats from technologically superior enemies, but
``significant shortcomings'' in its weapons and training will leave
it unable to challenge the United States for ``an indefinite period
of time,'' according to a Pentagon study released Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon's report said China's military modernization
efforts are also increasing its ability to threaten Taiwan,
especially with long-range missiles. But the study concluded that
the People's Liberation Army, hobbled by limitations in fighter
aircraft and amphibious ships, would not fare well if ordered to
invade Taiwan in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the short term (2000-2005), the PLA will have only a
limited capability to conduct integrated operations against
Taiwan,'' the unclassified version of a longer classified study
said.
</P>
<P>
   The study, one of a series mandated by Congress, will almost
certainly fuel the debate over the future of China's military and
focus new attention on the diplomatically perilous issue of arms
sales to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Because the study analyzed both strengths and weaknesses in the
Chinese military, its findings amounted to a Rorschach test,
providing critics and supporters of the Clinton administration's
policies toward China evidence to support their views.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can get whatever you want out of this report,'' one
Pentagon official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., one of Capitol Hill's most
ardent hawks on China, said the study highlighted President
Clinton's failed efforts to engage China and the need ``to view the
People's Republic of China as a strategic competitor, rather than a
strategic ally.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the analysis concluded that China's
leadership, headed by President Jiang Zemin, remained ``largely
preoccupied by domestic concerns,'' more than military and national
security issues.
</P>
<P>
   It said that in the aftermath of NATO's air war against
Yugoslavia and the bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, some
Chinese officials ``seriously considered'' giving defense a higher
priority, but that the leadership ``reaffirmed its priority
emphasis'' on economic growth during its annual retreat last
August.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, a potential conflict with Taiwan involving the United
States has become ``the dominant scenario'' guiding the Chinese
military's planning and weapons development, it said. The military,
while lagging technologically, has been pouring resources into
devising strategies and weapons to exploit U.S. weaknesses, the
study found.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese have also devoted enormous efforts to developing
means of ``electromagnetic warfare,'' and attacks on computer and
communications networks. And they have an ``aggressive program'' to
buy weapons from Russia, including missiles, attack submarines and,
most recently, two destroyers.
</P>
<P>
   The report, which relied on intelligence findings as well as
writings of China's military strategists, said the Chinese had
carefully studied the 1991 Persian Gulf War and NATO's air war
against Yugoslavia, where U.S.-led forces used overwhelming force
and technological superiority to crush the enemy. The analysis
found that much of China's research and training now centers on
countering just such an attack, by developing or buying missiles
and other weapons that could threaten advanced aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Still, while China is restructuring its armed forces, its air
force and navy remain too antiquated and ill-equipped to launch a
serious invasion of Taiwan or other countries in the region. The
navy's amphibious transport ships could carry only one infantry
division across the Taiwan Strait, leaving other troops dependent
on trawlers and fishing boats.
</P>
<P>
   The report's findings are likely to intensify pressure on the
United States to sell more and more advanced weapons to Taiwan to
counter the Chinese buildup. China has strongly opposed sales to
Taiwan, which it considers a renegade province. In April, the
administration approved a sale of upgraded missiles and a
long-range radar system, but refused Taiwan's request for four of
the most advanced U.S. destroyers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite lingering tensions, the report plays down the likelihood
of open conflict between China and Taiwan, arguing that Beijing
would avoid anything that risked its economic growth and access to
foreign markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``In initiating a military conflict with Taiwan, Beijing would
run the risk of jeopardizing both its continued economic
development and its political standing,'' the report concluded.
``China's resolve to employ military force, however, should not be
discounted.''

COMMENTARY: INTO THE QUAGMIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANTHONY LEWIS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ When the Senate approved the Tonkin Gulf Resolution in
1964, giving President Johnson carte blanche for war in Vietnam,
only two senators said no: Wayne Morse and Ernest Gruening. We have
made some progress since then. When the Senate voted this week for
an open-ended commitment to aid a war against drug cultivation in
Colombia, 11 senators dissented by supporting a modest amendment.
</P>
<P>
   The lives of American soldiers are not at risk in Colombia _
yet. But in other respects the parallels between this adventure and
Vietnam are spooky.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is about to approve an enormous program _ $1.3 billion
in military aid to Colombia as a first installment _ with no
convincing strategy and no end in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly as in the case of the Tonkin Gulf Resolution, there has
been little public debate or understanding. If Americans knew what
we were getting into in Colombia, I think they would overwhelmingly
reject this new involvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been no consideration of the consequences, cost and
length of involvement,'' said Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., one of
the opponents. ``This bill says let's get into war now and justify
it later.''
</P>
<P>
   Colombia is a country with a fragile civilian government and a
military with one of the worst human rights records in Latin
America. The country is harried by left-wing guerrilla groups and
right-wing paramilitaries, all financed by drug money.
</P>
<P>
   The theory of the military aid proposal is that the aid _
helicopters, crop destroyers and the like _ will be carefully
supervised by the U.S. military so it goes only to fight drug
trafficking, not to get involved in Colombia's civil wars. To state
that proposition is to recognize its absurdity.
</P>
<P>
   But the strategy is flawed for an even more fundamental reason.
Fighting narcotics by trying to reduce the supply is an idea with a
proven record _ of failure. We have been spraying coca fields and
aiding military forces in Latin America for 20 years. Cocaine is
cheaper and more available on our streets than ever.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt more coca plants will be eradicated in Colombia as the
$1.3 billion in military aid starts to flow in next year. What will
happen to the peasants whose fields have been poisoned and
livelihoods destroyed? Some will join the guerrillas. Others will
flee across the nearest border. Ecuador has already been warned to
expect 25,000 Colombian peasant refugees.
</P>
<P>
   And in the end there will be no reduction in the amount of
processed cocaine on the world market. Not if recent history is a
guide. Every time U.S. efforts have reduced production in one
place, it has increased elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The reason should be obvious in a world that now acknowledges
the power of the market. As long as the demand for illegal drugs
booms in the United States, someone will supply it. The profits
assure that.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia's national police chief, Gen. Rosso Jose Serrano, whose
efforts against drugs have been much admired, pointed to demand as
the key factor in a comment he made as he retired this week. ``We'd
rather see drug consumption drop than get any of this aid,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Study after study has shown that the key to dealing with the
drug problem is reducing demand. One by the Rand Corp. found that
treatment of drug users is 10 times more effective than trying to
interdict supplies. The defeated amendment to the Colombia bill
that got only 11 Senate votes would have used $225 million of the
military aid money for drug treatment and prevention programs in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Like so much in our drug policy, the Colombian adventure is a
product not of reason but of politics. The Colombian military,
whose political power will grow with fancy new weapons, lobbied
shrewdly in Washington. So did U.S. makers of helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   But the driving political force was fear _ just as in Vietnam.
Lyndon Johnson did not want to be the first American president to
lose a war. Bill Clinton knew that if he did not endorse the
Colombian adventure, Republicans would accuse him of being soft on
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   So in we go, hoping for light at the end of the tunnel.

TEXAS MURDER CASE MAY PUT DEATH PENALTY SPOTLIGHT ON CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   By RAYMOND BONNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the nation's attention drawn to recent
executions, the focus has been largely on the states, primarily
Illinois, whose governor has declared a moratorium, and Texas,
which puts more men and women to death than most countries and
whose governor, of course, is running for president.
</P>
<P>
   Although Vice President Al Gore favors the death penalty, he has
not faced the tough questioning that Gov. George W. Bush has, and
Gore has said little other than that he does not see the need for a
federal moratorium.
</P>
<P>
   But the case of a condemned migrant worker may soon call
attention to the federal capital punishment system.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Raul Garza, a migrant farm worker and high school dropout
who was convicted seven years ago of marijuana smuggling and three
drug-related murders in Brownsville, Texas, is scheduled to be
executed on Aug. 5. It would be the first federal execution since
John F. Kennedy was president.
</P>
<P>
   The Garza case raises broad, and for many, troubling issues
about the application of the federal death penalty, most
specifically, whether race and geography determine who is sentenced
to die at the hands of the U.S. government. Seventeen of the 21
federal death row inmates are minorities, and federal prosecutors
in a dozen Southern states account for more than half of the
federal cases in which the death penalty is sought.
</P>
<P>
   Garza's lawyers have exhausted legal appeals, and are turning to
the court of public opinion and politics.
</P>
<P>
   Garza wants to ask the president for clemency. But his lawyers
said they are facing some formidable handicaps.
</P>
<P>
   To begin with, there are no guidelines for filing a clemency
petition in a federal capital case.
</P>
<P>
   The president's power to grant clemency, be it reprieve,
commutation or pardon, is found in Article II of the Constitution.
It cannot be limited by Congress or the courts, which means the
president can grant clemency whenever he thinks the sentence is
unjust, mercy dictates or in the name of the public tranquility.
</P>
<P>
   The first step in the process is for the prisoner to file a
request with the pardon attorney of the Justice Department, who
then makes a recommendation to the president. That office has
adopted regulations and forms for inmates to use, but these apply
to noncapital cases.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said in February that the department was drafting
regulations for capital cases; a department official said Friday
that they were not yet finished. Garza's lawyers are waiting for
these in order to avoid filing a petition that is thrown out for
failing to follow procedures.

SHARANSKY CAMPAIGNS AGAINST ISRAELI CONCESSIONS TO THE PALESTINIANS
 
</HEADLINE>
   By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ A campaign of leaks is under way to pre-expose
Israel's bargaining positions in its peace negotiations so as to
put pressure on Prime Minister Ehud Barak against making
significant concessions to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   The latest leak came Friday when an Israeli newspaper printed
the contents of what it called a U.S. ``nonpaper'' that it said
could provide the basis for a three-way, retreat-style summit
meeting in the Washington area.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials dismissed the document as speculative, and
U.S. officials said it was unofficial, of unknown origin and
inaccurate.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the document, as summed up by the newspaper Yediot
Ahronot, does contain the plausible outline of an eventual
agreement. The newspaper said Interior Minister Natan Sharansky and
Ariel Sharon, leader of the rightist Likud Party, had obtained the
document. The office of Sharanksy said he had provided it to the
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The document said Israel would be able to consolidate and annex
settlement blocs with Palestinian assent, if it gave up equivalent
territory elsewhere. It says some 40,000 settlers would have to be
evacuated or, if the Palestinians eventually agreed, remain under
Palestinian rule.
</P>
<P>
   It said that if the Palestinians agreed, the Jordan Valley would
be transferred to full Palestinian control, but leased back to
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   It said that the principle of the right of return of Palestinian
refugees would be granted, but that very few refugees would
actually be allowed to come back. An ``opaque formula'' would
expand a family reunification plan that already exists, under a
different name.
</P>
<P>
   It said Barak is contemplating conceding Arab neighborhoods in
Jerusalem to Palestinian control in exchange for a Palestinian
declaration that the conflict is over.
</P>
<P>
   And it said the United States and other Western nations would
pledge an aid package of more than $100 billion that would be
distributed over 20 years. Most of the money would constitute a
compensation package for Palestinian refugees and their host
countries.
</P>
<P>
   A Western diplomat who saw the document said it was hand-written
and seemed to contain notes from a briefing by a Jewish-American
official. The notes refer to ``our land'' and ``our settlements.''
</P>
<P>
   Several weeks ago, Sharansky released what he said was his
understanding of Barak's intended concessions in an anguished
letter to the prime minister that he made public. Friday, the
essence of Sharansky's letter was reprinted in full-page
advertisements here, under the headline: ``Dear Prime Minister
Barak: We are seriously concerned.'' It is signed by members and
leaders of several American Jewish organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Late Friday, Sharanksy, whose Russian immigrant party remains
part of Barak's fragile coalition, sent the prime minister a letter
accusing him of keeping the coalition partners in the dark about
the substance of the negotiations. He said Barak planned to co-op
critics in his Cabinet by taking them with him to Washington, but
that it would not work: ``We will be left with only one choice _ to
agree to an accord to which we are opposed, or to reject it and
return home. This may sound simple in theory, but I know and you
know that the option to reject an agreement is unrealistic and
would lead to the disgrace of Israel before the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharanksy urged Barak to stop his ``race toward a summit'' and
to work more closely with his coalition partners to forge a
consensus agreement. Sharanksy said he would ``end the partnership
between us'' if Barak did not agree.

MILLENNIUM PHARMACEUTICALS ALLIES WITH EUROPE'S AVENTIS FOR DRUG
DEVELOPMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Millennium Pharmaceuticals Inc., a biotechnology company, will
receive up to $450 million in financing from Aventis Pharma, the
European drug company, as part of a wide-ranging drug development
and technology alliance announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is one of the largest ever between a pharmaceutical
company and a biotechnology startup, both in monetary value and the
level of cooperation between the companies.
</P>
<P>
   Aventis will buy $250 million in Millennium stock during the
next year. Based on Millennium's current market value, that would
give Aventis a stake of roughly 2 percent. Aventis will also pay up
to $200 million over five years to obtain technology for drug
development.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies will jointly develop drugs for inflammatory
diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, asthma and multiple
sclerosis. And they will work together to develop technology to
speed up development of drugs in general.
</P>
<P>
   ``This alliance with Aventis is truly an over-the-top
alliance,'' Mark Levin, chief executive officer of Millennium, said
in a conference call with reporters Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Hofstaetter, executive vice president of Aventis, said
the agreement could help Aventis fill gaps in its technical
capabilities in gene-hunting and analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Millennium, based in Cambridge, Mass., specializes in using
genomics to develop drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Millennium executives said the deal should help their company in
its quest to become a fully integrated pharmaceutical company.
</P>
<P>
   For the North American market, Millennium and Aventis will
equally share the cost of developing the drugs for inflammatory
diseases and the profits from selling them, with Millennium able to
participate in sales and marketing. This is different from most
such agreements, in which the pharmaceutical company handles sales
and pays the biotechnology company a royalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commercialization terms are very good for Millennium,''
said Michael King Jr., an analyst at Robertson Stephens in New
York. Outside North America, Aventis will handle drug development
and marketing and pay a royalty to Millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Executives of both companies said the inflammatory drug program
will be one of the largest in the world. But neither company will
contribute any drugs already in clinical trials. So it is likely to
be at least two to three years before a drug developed by the
alliance enter clinical trials, and perhaps an additional five
years before one reaches the market, the executives said.
</P>
<P>
   Millennium is known for its large deals with drug companies. Two
years ago, it announced a $465 million alliance with Bayer AG of
Germany. Millennium said all its partnerships combined will provide
it with $1.8 billion in revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Millennium shares sank 4 percent Friday, down $4.9375 to
$119.5625 because of concern over the price Aventis will pay for
its shares.
</P>
<P>
   Aventis will pay a little less than $120 a share for the first
$150 million of Millennium stock, which it will buy soon. That
price represents a 20 percent premium to the average price of
Millennium during the last 30 days, but is less than Millennium's
price in recent days because its stock, along with that of other
genomics companies, has been rising in anticipation of Monday's
expected announcement of the completion of the draft of the human
genome.
</P>
<P>
   Aventis will buy $50 million more of Millennium stock next
January and another $50 million in July, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Aventis Pharma, based in Frankfurt, Germany, is the
pharmaceutical subsidiary of Aventis SA, which is based in
Strasbourg, France, and was formed last year by the merger of
Hoechst AG of Germany and Rhone-Poulenc SA of France. Shares of
Aventis SA rose $1.3125 to $68.625 on the New York Stock Exchange
Friday.

 &HT;    African conflicts reveal something about continent, relief
efforts, ourselves
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, June 25.
 &HT;    By Don Melvin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1998, Journal-Constitution photographer Rich Addicks and I
traveled to southern Sudan, where famine was decimating the
population. We saw people too weak to stand, and we saw mothers
bury their babies.
</P>
<P>
   I knew the famine was not the result of drought or
overpopulation. It was caused by callous warriors who cared nothing
for human life. Still, the question of what to do seemed simple
enough: When people are starving, they must be fed. Addicks'
powerful and humane photographs conveyed the same message.
</P>
<P>
   People gave money to relief agencies. Schools organized
fund-raising drives. Some parents wrote to tell me that their
12-year-old son had sent all his savings to feed the hungry.
</P>
<P>
   Caring about other people makes us human. But, as Scott
Peterson's savage and penetrating new book makes clear, Africa is
rarely as simple as it seems.
</P>
<P>
   The delivery of food to Sudan has saved thousands of lives, but
it has also fueled a 20-year civil war. Sudan's warlords not only
create starvation by turning people into refugees, they sometimes
herd the starving into particular places so humanitarian agencies
will deliver food where the armies need it.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson, an American, covered Africa through much of the '90s
for the Daily Telegraph of London; in 1990 and '91 he also wrote
free-lance stories for the Journal-Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   He was sliced in the head with a machete in Somalia on a July
day in 1993 when a mob killed two of his colleagues. He was
hunkered in a foxhole in Sudan when a fellow correspondent was shot
through the leg. He walked through Rwanda when murderers roamed the
roads and bodies roiled the rivers.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike some reporters' memoirs, ``Me Against My Brother'' is
also a work of scholarship. It is extensively researched and
thoroughly documented. This is history at its most penetrating.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson chooses to write about Somalia, Sudan and Rwanda not
because they're the only places he knows _ he covered other
countries in Africa as well _ but because of what these horrific
experiences tell us about Africa, intervention and ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   The first half of the book is devoted to the U.S. and U.N.
experience in Somalia in the early '90s _ a mission bungled so
badly it led to international refusal to stop the genocide in
Rwanda in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The mission began when President Bush saw starving people on
television. Why not deliver food? he thought.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials like to describe what happened in Somalia as
``mission creep,'' but it was a 180-degree turn. Having missed an
opportunity to disarm the country's clans, Western officials
declared war on one Somali warlord, Gen. Mohamed Farah Aidid. The
U.N. devolved into just another warring clan; 90 percent of its
budget was being spent not on relief but on the military.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistani peacekeepers were killed raiding Aidid's radio
station. The U.N. escalated its war effort. On the day that
Peterson was set upon and his friends were killed, the mob was
reacting in rage to a missile attack by U.S. helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   The Journal-Constitution carried an Associated Press report that
said the missiles were fired at ``a renegade warlord's command
center,'' and 13 Somalis had died. Those were the official lies.
The missiles were fired at clan elders who had met to figure out
how to make peace with the U.N. And the Red Cross confirmed not 13
deaths, but 54.
</P>
<P>
   By the time it ended, this mission of mercy had resulted in the
deaths of dozens of peacekeepers and perhaps 2,000 Somalis. Then,
improbably, U.N. and U.S. officials rehabilitated Aidid and flew
him to peace talks in Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
   After all the blood, money and lies, what was accomplished?
``Nothing here,'' Peterson writes, ``had changed at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Little has changed in Sudan, either, as Peterson makes clear,
despite massive infusions of international food aid since the
1980s. The food feeds the armies, which then run roughshod over the
people, causing, in turn, more famine.
</P>
<P>
   To its credit, CARE, the Atlanta-based relief and development
organization, has realized that the cycle has no end. The
organization has abandoned its apolitical stance and begun lobbying
for a political end to the war. We can only hope that more
organizations come to realize that there's no such thing as
nonpolitical aid.
</P>
<P>
   Of Rwanda, what can be said? The worst stain on President
Clinton's record lies not on Monica Lewinsky's dress but in the
small country once known as the Switzerland of Africa. Some 800,000
people were murdered as the Clinton administration covered its eyes
and urged other nations not to act, either.
</P>
<P>
   Led by U.N. Ambassador Madeleine Albright, American officials
refused to use the word ``genocide'' because that word carries an
international legal responsibility to intervene. It was 1994 _ an
election year.
</P>
<P>
   All this while 45,000 people were being murdered every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine that every single word in this book is the name of a
victim,'' Peterson writes. ``This entire volume would then list
only 150,000 of the dead, not even one-fifth of the likely death
toll. More than five volumes of this book would be required to list
just the first names of every victim.''
</P>
<P>
   When Tutsi rebels took power, ending the genocide, the Hutus _
many of whose hands dripped with blood _ crossed into Zaire or
Tanzania, dropping their machetes in piles at the borders, and
walked into the open arms of relief organizations only too ready to
feed and rehabilitate them.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson writes with a searching anger that shows no mercy _ not
on the Africans who kill each other, nor on the humanitarians whose
bungling makes things worse, nor on the heart of a reader who
cares. He excoriates the international community but makes no
excuses for the killers.
</P>
<P>
   And on the continent where human life began, he finds some of
what it means to be human. Near the end of the book, he asks a
trauma psychologist this: Is there Rwanda within every one of us?
Comes the reply: ``Absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   But Africa shows that within each of us live other qualities,
too. One of Addicks' photographs from Sudan won first place in the
World Press Photo competition. The winning picture did not show an
emaciated infant nor an adult too weak to stand. It showed a mother
tenderly kissing the cheek of her child.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson ends on the same note. One morning in Rwanda his
attention was drawn by the tchk, tchk, tchk of a razor. A mother
was cropping her daughter's hair. In the movement of the mother's
hands and in the stifled giggles of the girl, Peterson found ``a
spiritual moment of great and common tenderness.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the slaughter, one can find _ even on the killing fields
of Rwanda _ such sweet and utter love.

AT&AMP;T REFILES ITS PLAN ON RATES 
</HEADLINE>
   By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T submitted a new proposal Friday that would give telephone
users more flexibility in seeking to save money on some
long-distance calls but that appeared to fall short of stemming the
outcry from consumer groups and federal regulators over its plans
to raise certain costs for tens of millions of customers.
</P>
<P>
   Caught between the demands of Wall Street to generate higher
earnings and the expectations of customers who were promised
savings because of lower access charges, AT&AMP;T said it would
eliminate the $3 monthly minimum charge for low-volume callers and
would offer a wider variety of options to reduce charges for people
who make most calls on certain weekend days.
</P>
<P>
   Still, rates for many long-distance calls would go up under the
plan, with some customers potentially facing per-minute charges as
much as 56 percent higher.
</P>
<P>
   While William E. Kennard, the chairman of the Federal
Communications Commission, said he was encouraged by AT&AMP;T's move, a
fellow commissioner sharply criticized the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``With its latest tariff filing, AT&AMP;T failed to deliver the
consumer benefits it promised,'' Gloria Tristani, one of the five
FCC commissioners, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T, which handles 60 percent of the United States' residential
long-distance calls, said it would give its 28 million customers
not on discount plans a choice of three options.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with the July telephone bills, one plan would allow
those customers to pay 16 cents a minute on all calls regardless of
time or day. Another plan would charge 10 cents a minute on one
weekend day chosen by the customer, but would impose higher charges
ranging from 18 cents to 29.5 cents a minute the rest of the week.
</P>
<P>
   Those who fail to select one of those plans would face rates
that would be raised several cents above AT&AMP;T's basic charges,
which are currently 11.5 cents on weekends, 26 cents on weekdays
and 16 cents on weekday evenings.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T said it consulted the FCC on the new rate plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do believe we've bent over backward to listen to people on
this,'' said James Cicconi, AT&AMP;T's general counsel. ``This reflects
extensive consultation with the FCC and with our customers.''
</P>
<P>
   The company said the new rate structure would cut its expected
profits for the year by a penny to 2 cents a share. Shares of AT&AMP;T
fell $1.6875, to $34.3125, on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The plan also generally failed to impress consumer advocates,
who praised its increased flexibility but criticized it for not
passing on enough savings to customers from a recent FCC agreement
reducing the fees that long-distance companies pay to local phone
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``While they've responded to public criticism, AT&AMP;T has not gone
far enough,'' said Gene Kimmelman, the co-director of the
Washington office of Consumers Union, an advocacy group. ``But at
least this proposal is an improvement, because it provides people
with more choices than they previously had.''
</P>
<P>
   After the FCC lowered the fees paid by long-distance carriers to
local telephone companies, AT&AMP;T and other companies were expected
to pass on some of these savings to customers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet on the same day the agreement was announced, AT&AMP;T filed
documents with the commission that suggested that the company would
increase most of the per-minute charges for customers who make few
calls.
</P>
<P>
   In Friday's filing, which was intended to mitigate the criticism
at the earlier proposal, AT&AMP;T eliminated its minimum monthly charge
of $3, a move that would benefit 15 million of the 28 million
customers that the company has under its basic plan. In addition,
AT&AMP;T eliminated a $1.51 carrier line charge.
</P>
<P>
   According to one of the plans put forward Friday, the company
would allow customers to make calls on one weekend day, either
Saturday or Sunday, for 10 cents a minute, a reduction from the
11.5 cents a minute that was available earlier. On the other
weekend day, though, charges would rise to 18 cents from 11.5
cents.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's proposal is cheaper when compared with the plan
submitted earlier this month that was discarded. Under that
proposal, customers were to be charged 29 cents a minute on all
days except Sunday, during which long-distance calls would cost 7
cents a minute.
</P>
<P>
   But for customers who do not choose any of AT&AMP;T's new plans, the
long-distance rates will go up, to 14.5 cents a minute from 11.5
cents on Saturday and Sunday, to 29.5 cents a minute from 26 cents
during peak hours on weekdays, and to 22.5 cents a minute from 19
cents on weeknights.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   WorldCom and Sprint, the second- and third-largest long-distance
companies, have not raised rates recently. Analysts suggested that
AT&AMP;T would probably not benefit from Friday's proposal, putting
additional pressure on the company's stock, which has declined
nearly 40 percent in the last three months.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guidance they're giving is that this should translate into
a net reduction in revenue,'' said Scott Cleland, a
telecommunications analyst at Legg Mason Precursor Group. ``This
isn't good for AT&AMP;T, given that they've been consistently losing
share to competitors.''

NEW CAUCUS AIMS TO HELP NATION RIDE OUT THE STORM 
</HEADLINE>
 (Eds: Southern Exposure is the weekly political notebook from the
Washington Bureau of the New York Times Regional Newspapers) &HT;    
 By CARL HULSE  
NYT Regional Newspapers  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   WASHINGTON _ Natural disasters are
<TEXT>
hardly new. But to some members of Congress, the demands that
increasingly frequent hurricanes, floods, twisters and forest fires
place on federal relief efforts are nearing cataclysmic
proportions.
<P>
   Already this year, disasters have been declared in Alabama,
Kentucky, Tennessee, Texas and seven other states. Last year began
with tornadoes tearing through Arkansas, Louisiana and Georgia and
ended with Hurricane Floyd decimating parts of North Carolina and
the Eastern Seaboard, killing more than 50 people and doing an
estimated $6 billion in damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``No part of this country is immune to natural disasters,'' said
Sen. John Edwards, D-N.C.
</P>
<P>
   To better prepare the nation and Congress for future
catastrophes, Edwards and other lawmakers have formed the Natural
Hazards Caucus with the goals of making federal relief more
accessible and encouraging preventive action that can lower the
human and financial toll from any calamity.
</P>
<P>
   James Lee Witt, the head of the Federal Emergency Management
Agency, told the inaugural meeting of the caucus co-chaired by Sen.
Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, that the federal government spends only $25
million annually on disaster mitigation compared with billions
poured out for disaster aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mitigation and prevention saves lives, saves dollars and makes
good sense,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards said the caucus hopes to propose ways to better
coordinate disaster response, streamline the process of applying
for aid, and encourage a public mind-set more geared toward
prevention.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens said he would also like to advance legislation that
shifts more of the responsibility for insuring against major
disasters to the private sector, though he conceded such a proposal
has no chance in an election year.
</P>
<P>
   Caucuses are a common way for lawmakers to focus attention on
favorite causes. Their effectiveness is often related to the energy
put behind the organization. Some recent groups, such as the
moderate Blue Dog Coalition, have had significant impacts on
policy.
</P>
<P>
   Other Southern charter members of the Natural Hazard Caucus
include Democratic Sens. John Breaux of Louisiana, Max Cleland of
Georgia and Chuck Robb of Virginia and Republican Thad Cochran of
Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   TOBACCO VOTE
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco-state lawmakers from both parties want to extinguish
funding for the Clinton administration's lawsuit against the
tobacco industry to recoup federal health care spending on
smoking-related illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all Southern Republicans opposed spending $4 million
in Department of Veterans Affairs money to press the suit. And most
of the three dozen Democrats who voted with them also hailed from
the region, driven by sympathy for the growers they represent and a
fair amount of campaign money distributed by the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   The advocacy group Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids reported that
the 207 House members who voted to cut off funding for the suit
typically received five times the tobacco industry contributions of
those who backed the suit. Funding for the legal effort will be a
running feud as Congress sorts through the spending bills for the
agencies involved.
</P>
<P>
   WHOSE CHOICE?
</P>
<P>
   Congress might not be eager to fund school vouchers, but the
conservative Heritage Foundation found that lawmakers who oppose
them are not reluctant to send their own children to private
school.
</P>
<P>
   A poll of lawmakers done by the group determined that almost
half the senators and 40 percent of the House members who responded
had enrolled at least one child in a private school. The group said
that members of Congress who took advantage of private schools for
their own families helped defeat House and Senate measures that
would have given more Americans the same opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   But critics of school vouchers say their opposition doesn't stem
from anyone choosing private schools but instead is based on
resistance to using public dollars to support such institutions.
</P>
<P>
   MONUMENTAL PUSH
</P>
<P>
   While residents of the West are fighting Clinton administration
efforts to preserve land by granting it national monument status,
an Alabama group is pushing the White House to bestow the title on
two national forests in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the Alabama National Monument Coalition met recently
with officials of the White House Council on Environmental Quality
to press for monument status for the Talladega and Bankhead
forests.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the group contend the forests are being exploited by
timber companies from outside the state, but they are certain to
run into opposition from groups concerned about any restrictions on
forest use.

AMAZON STOCK PLUNGES 19 PERCENT AFTER ANALYSTS' REPORT 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Shares of Amazon.com, the Internet industry's
bellwether stock, plummeted 19 percent in heavy trading Friday as
investors grew nervous about the company's financial health and its
prospects for profitability.
</P>
<P>
   Other Internet companies were sucked into the downdraft: shares
of E-Bay fell 7.4 percent and America Online lost 5.3 percent of
its value.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's decline in Amazon shares appeared to be a reaction to
comments issued by two research analysts at influential Wall Street
firms. Ravi Suria, a credit analyst at Lehman Brothers, wrote an
in-depth report on Amazon's $2 billion in bonds issued during the
last few years, calling into question the company's financial
strength and ability to generate cash to repay bondholders. For
Amazon to be a successful business, Suria wrote, ``it must be able
to generate the cash operating profile of a successful retailer. It
is essentially this yardstick that we use to analyze the company,
and as the rest of this report shows, we find it woefully
lacking....''
</P>
<P>
   Amazon's bonds fell 10 percent on the day.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Amazon fell $8.125, to $33.875. The stock is down 55
percent so far this year. The company has never posted a profit.
</P>
<P>
   Suria said he wrote the report after scrutinizing the company's
first quarter results, made public last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we think truly pushed a weak credit off the cliff was the
inept working capital management during the last holiday season,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Because the company does not generate positive cash flow on each
piece of merchandise that it sells, Suria added, Amazon has had to
rely on obliging investors to fund its operations. But as Internet
companies have begun to fail, ``the market has become a lot more
selective,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Curry, Amazon.com's spokesman, called Suria's report
``hogwash.'' But he declined to identify specific facts in the
report the company disputed. According to a source close to the
company, Suria's report was also made available to Amazon Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the turmoil Friday were mixed messages to investors
from Mary Meeker, the influential Internet analyst at Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter, the firm that has managed both of Amazon.com's
recent bond offerings. As recently as June 2, Meeker was positive
on Amazon. But a message to the Morgan Stanley's salespeople Friday
morning summarizing Meeker's views on Amazon, began this way:
``Mary believes there will be no upside to her June and September
revenue estimates and there could be some modest downside.''
</P>
<P>
   In a later communique dictated by Meeker, there was no mention
of a ``modest downside'' to the company's prospects. A Morgan
Stanley spokesman could not explain the discrepancy between the two
messages. Meeker was traveling and could not be reached.
</P>
<P>
   Neither analysts' report was based on new information about
Amazon's business. Curry said the company never discusses its
operations between quarterly earnings conference calls with
analysts. The next such call, which will detail company results for
the second quarter, is scheduled for July 26. Amazon's stumble did
not shake the faith of one big investor. Managers of Legg Mason
mutual funds in Baltimore were buying shares of the company's stock
and bonds as they fell Friday, said Lisa Rapuano, director of
research at the firm.
</P>
<P>
   The company's popular Value Trust fund started Friday with about
2.8 percent of its assets, or about $375 million, in Amazon's
stock. By the end of the day, those shares were worth about $300
million, but the fund's manager, Bill Miller, was buying more.
Miller, whose fund has outperformed the overall stock market for
nine consecutive years, has been saying that Amazon's stock price
could go to $90 or higher, and Friday, Rapuano was not backing away
from that view. She described the reports that had triggered the
sell-off as ``baffling.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's evident that nobody likes e-commerce right now,'' she
said. ``On the other hand, it's evident that if Amazon doesn't
work, then nothing's going to work in e-commerce. You don't have 20
million customers on something that isn't real.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors obviously agree that Amazon, the company, is real. As
long as its profits remain virtual, however, investors are likely
to be skittish.

EPA PLAN TO STEM FLOW OF SMOG TO EAST COAST IS UPHELD BY COURT 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID STOUT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal appeals court has upheld a new
air-pollution program meant to drastically reduce smog that flows
from the Midwest to the East.
</P>
<P>
   Although still subject to further appeals, the ruling on
Thursday by the District of Columbia U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
would affect 19 states. It upholds a decision by a three-judge
panel of the same tribunal, which held in March that rules set down
by the Environmental Protection Agency in 1998, but stayed by a
lawsuit, were proper.
</P>
<P>
   ``This decision is a major environmental victory for everyone
living throughout the Eastern United States,'' Carol M. Browner,
the EPA administrator, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials have said the new rules could remove 1.1
million tons of nitrogen oxide _ equivalent to the pollution from
166 million cars _ from the air each year. They estimate that the
endeavor will cost $1.7 billion annually over 15 years but make up
for it in lower medical costs and better public health.
</P>
<P>
   Two environmental groups, the Natural Resources Defense Council
and the Clean Air Trust, expressed elation. ``This decision will
help clear up the smog that has been searing the lungs of people
across the Eastern United States,'' said David Hawkins, a lawyer
for the natural resources group.
</P>
<P>
   It was not certain how quickly the new rules, supposed to be in
place by 2003, would actually go into effect. Michigan and West
Virginia, whose officials contend that their states have been
treated unfairly, and other parties that have sued the EPA may seek
an appeal before the Supreme Court. Or lawmakers from those states
and others could fight the EPA in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Coal-burning power plants are the target of the regulatory
action because the smog-causing chemical the EPA is going after,
nitrogen oxide, is a byproduct of burning fossil fuels. Federal
officials say more than 100 million people live in regions where
the air would be improved, especially in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   New York, New Jersey and Connecticut and other states in the
East are also covered by the regulations, but the issue has
developed as one that pits those states and others against states
farther west. More than half the reductions in nitrogen oxide
emissions would come in six states: Illinois, Indiana, Michigan,
Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Officials in New York state have viewed the new regulations
favorably, and EPA officials said Friday afternoon that the state
had already submitted plans for reducing its smog.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey has also moved to upgrade its coal plants, the EPA
said. Robert C. Schinn Jr., commissioner of New Jersey's Department
of Environmental Protection, called the appeals court action ``an
enormous boost'' for the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut officials, too, lauded the court decision. The
state's attorney general, Richard Blumenthal, said Friday that the
case was ``a poor candidate'' for Supreme Court review. ``There's
no conflict among the federal courts, it's plainly correct on the
merits and it requires no drastic change in national policy,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials estimate that the new rules would cost a
typical household $1 a month in extra electricity charges that the
utilities would pass on to their customers to cover costs of
upgrading equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The Midwest Ozone Group, a coalition of utilities and other
businesses that have contested the regulations, expressed
disappointment through its lawyer Kathy G. Beckett, who said group
members had been trying to cut down on pollution. She said the
coalition would consider an appeal to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental officials in Michigan and West Virginia said that
their states had been trying hard to cut down on their pollution,
and that they, too, would consider further appeals. They
questioned, too, whether their states really polluted New England
skies as much as some people suspected.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do need to reduce our emissions, and I know we create some
problems for Pittsburgh,'' said Skipp Kropp, an environmental
official in West Virginia. ``But New Hampshire?''
</P>
<P>
   The 19 states have 128 days from the appeals court ruling, or
roughly to the end of October, to tell the EPA how they expect to
comply. Assuming the new rules go into effect, states that fall
short could face sanctions, including the loss of highway
construction money.
</P>
<P>
   Other states covered are Alabama, Delaware, Kentucky, Maryland,
Massachusetts, North Carolina, Rhode Island, South Carolina,
Tennessee and Virginia. Three others, Georgia, Missouri and
Wisconsin, were included in the EPA's original order, but the
appeals court removed them pending further review.

MISSILE DEFENSE CRITIC SAYS US TRYING TO SILENCE HIM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ABEL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ As the debate heats up over whether the United States
should build a national missile defense, one of the program's
leading critics, an MIT professor, is charging the Pentagon with
trying to silence him.
</P>
<P>
   This week, three agents from the Pentagon's Defense Security
Service arrived unannounced at Theodore A. Postol's office at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. They said they came to show
the outspoken physicist classified documents, Postol said.
</P>
<P>
   But Postol said he refused to look at the papers stamped
``SECRET.'' Recalling the Army's attempt to classify his critical
analysis of Raytheon Corp.'s Patriot missile after the 1991 Gulf
War, he believes the agents' visit was a ruse to prevent him from
speaking out further against the proposed antimissile system, which
has already cost at least $60 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely saw this as potential for entrapment and a means
of intimidation,'' said Postol, so miffed he wrote a letter to John
Podesta, President Clinton's chief of staff, after the Wednesday
morning visit. ``By showing me classified information, they could
say I was talking about classified information. I saw it as a means
of abridging my First-Amendment rights.''
</P>
<P>
   The surprise visit came more than a month after Postol, once one
of the military's top science advisers, made headlines after a
letter he wrote to the White House detailed potential pitfalls in
the Clinton administration's missile-defense plan and exposed what
he says is evidence of a cover-up.
</P>
<P>
   In the letter, the 54-year-old professor explained why he and
many scientists believe current technology is incapable of
defeating a ballistic missile attack. The essence of his dissent is
that the system being developed can't differentiate a potential
enemy's decoys from its warheads. A few balloons, he said, might be
sufficient to fool current or future antimissiles.
</P>
<P>
   But shortly after the letter arrived at the White House,
officials sent it to the Pentagon's Ballistic Missile Defense
Office. Officials there promptly classified Postol's findings, even
though the letter had already been posted on the Internet. The move
echoed the Army's attempt to silence the professor after the Gulf
War.
</P>
<P>
   Although Postol says he never received a call before the
Pentagon agents popped into his office, and accuses the security
service of improperly handling secret documents, a DSS spokeswoman
said the agents repeatedly tried to contact the professor and
followed strict protocol in presenting the information.
</P>
<P>
   Caryl Clubb, a Defense Security Service spokeswoman, said the
agents went to Postol's office to deliver a letter from the
service's deputy chief of staff for industrial security. The
document detailed areas in which Postol's White House letter
contained classified information, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of our visit was to prevent the further disclosure
of classified information,'' Clubb said. ``We in no way, shape or
form meant to get him to stop speaking out.''
</P>
<P>
   But Postol and others describe the visit as a tactic they say
the government has used before to silence informed dissidents with
high-level security clearances. A scientific adviser to the chief
of naval operations in the 1980s, Postol has top-secret clearances
at the departments of energy and defense.
</P>
<P>
   Yet all the information he assembled in his White House letter,
he contends, came from a lawsuit filed by a senior engineer against
the military contractor TRW Inc., which accused the contractor of
sending the Pentagon fraudulent performance reports about a key
portion of the antimissile system.
</P>
<P>
   If Postol had consented to view the letter, he said, he would be
obliged not to talk about its contents, even if the information was
identical to what he previously published. The penalty for
revealing the contents of a classified document ranges from the
loss of security clearances to a prison sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``This entire episode is Kafkaesque,'' said Democratic US
Representative Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts, who said he plans
to ask the General Accounting Office to investigate. ``First, you
have the government classifying a report raising questions about
potential fraud . . . then you have government agents showing up at
the author's office, trying to force him to read a classified
document that he doesn't want to read.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Cirincione, director of the Nonproliferation Center at
the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said it ``appears
they were trying to force feed him classified material for reasons
other than his education on this matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Weeks, a former congressional military analyst who runs
a project on nuclear policy at Harvard's Kennedy School of
Government, said the episode might have been a clumsy attempt to
explain the missile program to Postol.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's plausible this was an effort to silence him,''
she said. ``It also may have just been a dumb, badly managed way of
showing him classified information.''
</P>
<P>
   Postol, though, has no doubts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This wasn't an accident,'' he said. ``They know what they were
doing.''

 &HT;    The closing riffs of a writer caught in a Catch-22

   &QR;  Portrait of an Artist,
</P>
<P>
   as an Old Man. By Joseph Heller. Simon &AMP; Schuster. $23.
</P>
<P>
   With aging comes a good chance not just of atherosclerosis but
also a certain peace of mind, a disinclination to kickhorses you
once kicked dead or alive or to disturb the dog's slumber. It can
be a sad thing, not catastrophic like a coronary but sweet-sad in
the way a sunset can be when minute by minute the day is slipping
away. Like the fire whose heat is ebbing, a writer's creative
juices are an exhaustible resource, and no one knows it better than
the writer himself.
</P>
<P>
   So conscious of it are they that many writers are convinced
they're running on empty, with miles to go and a contract hanging
over their heads. Others, like the late Joseph Heller, live the
self-torture of trying to repeat what cannot be repeated.
</P>
<P>
   With his first book, Heller entered both a title and an idea
into the vernacular. Because of Heller, even people who don't read
know what a ``Catch-22'' is. Heller's satirical war novel,
published in 1961, crystallized a no-win situation with mordant
accuracy, even if critics were slow to recognize it.
</P>
<P>
   Heller captured the particular insanity of the military _ of any
bureaucracy _ only too well, and every novel he published
subsequently was widely reviewed but inevitably compared with the
one that was wittier, crisper in its dialogue, sharper in its
delineation of our social maladies and, inevitably, just a little
better. Many were best sellers, because he had made his name. But
book by book _ seven in all _ they were judged to have fallen
short, and by a little more each time.
</P>
<P>
   It makes little difference that Heller's 1974 novel ``Something
Happened,'' a satire of the corporation's crushing effects on
individuality, today seems as funny as and more contemporary than
``Catch-22.'' The common opinion was that Heller had already said
what he had to say.
</P>
<P>
   But he wanted to be celebrated one last time, like the drunk who
hears his bar stool buddies toasting him as he heads off into the
night. In ``Portrait of an Artist, as an Old Man,'' Heller's
autobiographical protagonist Eugene Pota tells his editor: ``I want
to cap my career with a masterpiece of some kind, a great, original
work, even a great very small one. I want to crown my end with
applause, to go out on a note of triumph. Like an athlete dying
young, but my race finally run.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be too easy, and unkind, to pull the leg back and lay
the boot into this expired thoroughbred. Better that we note, with
disappointment and regret, that this time he really did pull up
lame. ``Portrait of an Artist, as an Old Man'' is not a book that
needed to be published, and Simon &AMP; Schuster certainly knows it. It
is like a guitarist closing his show with a series of riffs, some
of them brilliant but none of them connected to anything whole.
</P>
<P>
   Heller the man died of a heart attack. Heller the artist died in
the paralysis of writer's block. The autopsy, if you have $23 to
spare, is here between covers. Heller wrote it himself:
</P>
<P>
   ``The artificer who lives long enough, particularly the writer
of fictions for page and stage, may come to a time in his life when
he feels he has nothing new to write about but wishes to continue
anyway. Musicians joke in belittlement about the last compositions
of Mozart, who died young, that he did not know when to quit.
Shakespeare did know when to quit: `Our revels now are ended,' he
wrote in `The Tempest,' and departed with his winnings for the role
of a country squire in Stratford.''
</P>
<P>
   Give a dead man the benefit of the doubt and assume the implied
comparisons were unintended. All that need be said is that Heller
had an aberrant, skewed sense of humor that _ in more books than
just his first _ nailed our obsessions and frailties. He was once
himself the fresh new voice, and at the end of his life he saw how
frantically we search for anything new and novel: ``After all, a
new talent can be discovered only once. And astonish hardly more
than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more darkly, ``Portrait of an Artist'' sees marital fault
lines with a spooky clarity: ``Talkative and good-natured, she
commonly had very much more she wished to say than he cared to
hear, and she often found herself in what she thought of as a
Catch-22: she must either refrain from talking to him about things
she wished to talk to somebody about, in effect surrender her right
to freedom of speech, or risk his irritated, sometimes furious
discontent by boring him loquaciously, and neither seemed fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Heller, as it happens, was caught in a Catch-22 of his own:
``Like others am

 &HT;    Big wheels training in Warm Springs
 &HT;    By Mike Tierney
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WARM SPRINGS, Ga. _ Franklin D. Roosevelt was a visionary.
Ranked second all-time on your presidential hit parade by a panel
of historians, he left a legacy ranging from his New Deal policies
to his recognition of the disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the polio-stricken FDR in his wheelchair today, tooling
around his old stomping grounds, chatting up the distinguished
boarders at the Roosevelt Warm Springs Institute for
Rehabilitation. Not even he could have foreseen that the facility
someday would lure accomplished disabled athletes from across the
globe to train for events such as the upcoming Paralympics in
Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   An inquisitive sort, FDR might have had some questions for what
surely would be his favorite competitors _ these big deals on
wheels.
</P>
<P>
   Are more racers disabled through congenital or childhood
diseases, or by accidents? About one in every four is a victim,
mostly of disease, at birth or at a young age, estimates Wendy
Gumbert, director of the Roosevelt Sports Training Center. Those
athletes enter the sport with a mental edge because they have long
been accustomed to coping with their infirmities.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't know what it's like to be able-bodied,'' Gumbert
said. ``(If it happens) at 18, you're going to go through a
depression phase. It's a total life change.''
</P>
<P>
   Blue-ribbon racer Saul Mendoza of Mexico was afflicted by polio
at age 1. The upstart Josh Brunies of Hammond, La., and the
established Louise Savage, an Australian who hauled away four gold
medals from the 1996 Paralympics, are spina bifida casualties from
an early age. Cheri Blauwet was a year old when her father
accidentally drove a tractor over her on their farm in Larchwood,
Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   The majority includes John MacLean, a 33-year-old Aussie who was
riding a bike in 1988 when he was hit by an 8-ton truck going
nearly 70 mph. The Canadian Andre Beaudoin was 20 when he crashed
on a motocross bike while zipping across a field. ``When you're
young,'' Beaudoin said, ``you do things you don't know are
dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   And Ted Brides? Now, there's a story.
</P>
<P>
   LET'S HEAR IT
</P>
<P>
   A triple amputee from Miami, he was a platoon leader in Vietnam
in 1970. One morning, he left a foxhole to fill some canteens and
caught mortar fire on the way back. ``I felt like I was being
billowed up in a cloud,'' he recalled. He landed to see his fingers
at odd angles and his legs splayed. ``I remember feeling oddly calm
about it. There was relief that I was going home.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, 54, he didn't take up wheelchair racing until 10 years ago,
inspired by a man who eventually raced a 5-miler at age 83 a few
months before his death. In 1995, he told himself, ``I'm getting
too old for this.'' But he won two medals in Atlanta and is back
for more.
</P>
<P>
   How can a triple amputee race? Brides uses a wheelchair that
allows him to steer by placing the hook, which replaced his right
arm, into a ring. He ``pulls'' with his left arm.
</P>
<P>
   That's nothing. Quadruple amputee Tony Valenpost, a sprinter,
places his nubs on paint cans for traction and pushes off for fast
starts.
</P>
<P>
   How much strategy is involved in racing? A lot. Racers can draft
off each other, same as race-car drivers. Some pace themselves,
while others go all-out to seize the lead and dare competitors to
come get them. Racers have to find the proper path. Taking the
inside lane saves ground, but they can veer to the outside for an
unobstructed route.
</P>
<P>
   Listening to the racers is like eavesdropping on Dale Earnhardt
talking with his crew chief: drafting, pulling, boxing in, blocking
out, breaking the pace . . . .
</P>
<P>
   Even the tires involve some thought. Do you inflate them to high
pressure and maximize speed or cut off the pump and lower the risk
of a blowout?
</P>
<P>
   Are there collisions? Oh, yeah. Many racers observe a
gentleman's agreement and make way for charging competitors, but
it's not always the case, and crashes can occur. Josh Brunies,
sporting a nasty forearm bruise from a wreck the day before, said,
``Some people are out there for themselves. They don't care what
happens to everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   How important are the wheelchairs to the racers? To some, like a
member of the family. ``I used to beat my chair, but you gotta baby
your chair. I don't want nobody touching mine,'' said Brunies, who
refuses to check his as baggage on flights. Sauvage has a beloved
beat-up chair that is remindful of the old, rusting car you cannot
part with.
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza damaged his cherished chair in a collision early in the
Atlanta Paralympics. ``I'm done,'' he said. ``I better go home.'' A
replacement arrived, and Mendoza spun the new wheels to a record.
</P>
<P>
   Racers can rig their chairs with tape to make them more
aerodymanic, but improved technology has made them fairly uniform
and equally fast.
</P>
<P>
   Is wheelchair racing a full-time job? For the upper crust, yes.
Mendoza, a Los Angeles Marathon winner four consecutive times,
trains mornings and afternoons, covering as much as 125 miles per
week on the roads of Pine Mountain. For him, the Institute is home
for about eight months of the year. Like others, he has easy access
to Hartsfield International for flying to competitions around the
world. He entered 30 races last year _ winning 28, worth as much as
$5,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   Sauvage, who generally does road work in the a.m. and gym work
after lunch, competes in well-paying marathons, such as Boston. She
collected $10,000 by winning there once. This year, she finished
second.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the elite have sponsorship deals. McClain has appeared
in a few shoe commercials overseas, one in which he starred as The
Mayor of Niketown.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's largely a hard labor of love. Mendoza, for all of
his success, makes a modest living. A college graduate, he retired
in 1988, unretired two weeks later. ``I couldn't handle it,'' he
said. ``I realized it was my passion.''
</P>
<P>
   For others, it's just one part of their lives. Blauwet, 19, is a
4.0 student at the University of Arizona in molecular biology and
music who plays clarinet and piano. Her boyfriend is an able-bodied
triathlete.
</P>
<P>
   So, these people are real athletes? You bet. MacLean's accident
occurred while he was training for a triathlon. Since, he has
competed in the Ironman in Hawaii and has swum the English Channel.
Brides played college football. Mendoza was named Mexico's athlete
of the year in 1996. Sauvage says, ``My life is sport.''
</P>
<P>
   Role models, too. Mendoza has lifted the spirits of disabled
Hispanic kids at Grady Memorial Hospital. MacLean aspires to teach
youngsters ``to be a player, not a spectator.'' Blauwet sees
herself operating sports camps for the disabled someday.
</P>
<P>
   What makes a good disabled athlete? A spirit of independence
helps. Blauwet's parents encouraged her to reach to the top shelf
for items rather than fetching them for her. Also, a high pain
threshhold. Sauvage hyperextended her elbow and, rather than taking
R&AMP;R, taped it up and kept training. She and Blauwet have rods
implanted in their backs.
</P>
<P>
   What do you think of the Roosevelt Warm Springs Institute as a
place to train? ``It's brilliant,'' MacLean said.
</P>
<P>
   So, you might say it's the New Deal. Is that why everyone seems
in such a good mood here? Well, if you listen closely, you will
hear complaints about the track surface that raises the risk of
accidents. But, overall, these are grateful men and women.
</P>
<P>
   Here is Wendy Gumbert's take on the smiles: ``They are totally
happy with their lives. Any barriers (about being disabled) were
broken a long time ago. Had they not broken them, they wouldn't be
competing for the Paralympics.''

SPURNED SUITORS RUIN WOMEN'S FACES AND LIVES WITH A SPLASH OF
ACID 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARRY BEARAK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GOSARIGAON, Bangladesh _ The village elders met under a litchi
tree, applying their collective wisdom to put a value on Peyara's
grotesquely ruined face.
</P>
<P>
   The crime was hideous, they soberly agreed. A young man had
become obsessed with her, but she was married and he was turned
away. He took his revenge with sulfuric acid, to erase the beauty
that had once enchanted him and to empty her life of happiness.
</P>
<P>
   Her cheeks melted. Her right eye was blinded and hollowed like a
crater.
</P>
<P>
   But what is done cannot be undone, the elders said. The attacker
had been arrested. And his uncle, a respected religious man, had
long pressed them to hold a shaleesh _ or informal court _ to
mediate between the parties as is the tradition. He was willing to
pay the victim's family a reasonable sum to atone for the wrong and
buy his nephew's freedom.
</P>
<P>
   So when the seven elders met in April, taking an unusually long
time, they tried hard to be fair. Some who had seen the horrible
disfigurement thought $10,000 a proper settlement. But others
wondered aloud: his had been a crime of wild passion. Do a man's
emotions go so wild unless a woman has done something improper? To
them, $1,000 seemed enough.
</P>
<P>
   And so the arguing went on for three hours.
</P>
<P>
   In Bangladesh, such stories have become plentiful. In the 12
months through March 1999, 174 acid attacks were reported. Most
often, the culprit is a spurned suitor.
</P>
<P>
   No one is sure why this crime occurs here at such a high pace,
for this nation on the Indian subcontinent is not so different from
many others in its poverty or its culture or its treatment of
women. Inexplicably, some aberrant ripple is moving through the
countryside. Nariphokko, a woman's rights group, has kept
statistics: 80 attacks in 1996, 117 in 1997, 130 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The horror for the victim is overwhelming. ``It felt like
someone had poured boiling water on me,'' said Bilkis Khatun, a
13-year-old girl attacked as she slept. Her right ear is now only a
nub. ``My mother and father rushed in. They thought I was having a
bad dream, but when they saw my face burning, they shrieked.''
</P>
<P>
   Some victims die, but that seems unintended. The purpose of the
attacker is to manufacture a living hell, and in that there is most
often fulfillment.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors are left not only with their inflicted deformities but
also with the peculiarities of village and family reckoning. One
young woman was forced by her parents to marry her attacker,
solving the urgent matter of who would support a woman unwanted as
a bride. Another was forbidden to come home until she allowed her
husband to take a second wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``The man who did this to me is in jail,'' said Peyara Begum,
her eyes behind the dark glasses that conceal her worst scars.
``But I am in jail too, and for me there is no door, no escape,
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Early in April, she worried that there would be no justice as
well. The crime has a maximum penalty of death, but policemen and
prosecutors are often corrupt. Most attackers are never arrested;
most of the arrested are never tried. No one has ever been
executed.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen months had passed since the attack. A 20-year-old man,
Rakimuddin, who like many here uses only one name, is the accused.
Peyara's husband, Afsaruddin, 38, had been forced to bribe
prosecutors before they would pursue the case. Medical bills had
already left the family destitute. He and his brothers had to sell
off their legacy, a parcel of land.
</P>
<P>
   And now, to Peyara's disbelief, the elders were agreeing to a
shaleesh, suggesting a bargain. This was unthinkable, she said. It
would seem like forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Peyara's village is Gosarigaon, 40 miles north of Dhaka, the
capital. Her home is made of tin and mud. It sits in a clearing
surrounded by mangoes, banyans and mahogany. The rice paddies
nearby reach to the horizon. Carp are abundant in the ponds.
</P>
<P>
   The most respected man in the area is Moti Master, 74, a former
school principal whose stringy white beard goes well with his
reputation for wisdom. He had reluctantly decided to intercede in
this disagreeable business. Usually, a shaleesh settles property
disputes and petty grievances. Brutal assault is not on its agenda.
</P>
<P>
   But Moti Master knew both the families and suggested that each
could benefit from a compromise. He said it surprised him when
Afsaruddin _ a quiet, well-liked man who sells cooked rice along
the roadside _ responded with uncharacteristic boldness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Haven't you seen my wife's face?'' Peyara's husband said with
anger. ``My family has been destroyed. This is not a matter about
money.''
</P>
<P>
   But one of Afsaruddin's brothers was more open to settling. He
signed a paper for the family. And Moti Master, the peacemaker,
said this approval was sufficient to convene the meeting of the
elders. No outcome could be imposed on Afsaruddin, but Moti Master
said that he felt confident he would eventually respect the
decision of his betters.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband loves me very much,'' Peyara said during these
fretful days. ``But he is not a strong man, and I am afraid the
influential people can make him agree to a deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the attack, she had returned to the village only once. Her
8-year-old son, Awlad, had been struck with errant splashes of the
acid. His burns were on his arm, chest and stomach. The two were
temporarily living in a house for acid victims recovering from
surgery, the rent paid by a charity.
</P>
<P>
   There, secreted away, 20 women and the boy shared their common
grief, safe from insults and stares and pity. Anger sometimes rose
in them in a chorus. Just once, they said, they would like to ask
some man to marry them and then throw acid in his face when he said
no. Maybe then the world would understand.
</P>
<P>
   Most often, though, melancholy and guilt held sway. Bangladesh
is an Islamic country, and the acid victims asked themselves what
they had done to offend Allah.
</P>
<P>
   Learned women from the rights groups of Dhaka are inclined to
talk of ``frustrated gender relations'' when they discuss the acid
attacks, reproaching a male-dominated, conservative society where
boys and girls are not free to meet alone and get acquainted. But
the disfigured women are more likely to reach quite a different
conclusion, saying their nation has grown too permissive and they
would have been better off veiled, with their flesh out of sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I believe in strict purdah,'' Peyara said. ``If I had been
kept under the veil, Rakim would not have seen me or been able to
talk to me. My life would not be ruined.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   She told her story.
</P>
<P>
   Rakimuddin, who lived on the other side of the litchi grove, had
been hired to tutor her two sons in their house while Peyara worked
outside in the open kitchen, cooking the curry that was used by her
husband to flavor the rice at their modest stall.
</P>
<P>
   After several weeks, his interest seemed to shift from his
pupils to her. ``He said my husband was a bad match for me, that I
was too beautiful for him,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She complained to her husband. The tutor was fired, but he
continued to come around. He professed love, Peyara said. In
exasperation, she sent word to the young man's uncle, who is a
moulvi _ a religious scholar _ asking him to intervene.
</P>
<P>
   Rakimuddin then received a thrashing by an older brother, say
some of his family members. Soon after, he swallowed poison in a
failed effort at suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, near sundown on a cool winter night, Rakimuddin pushed
open the door of Peyara's house. He held a cup in his hand, she
said. She was sitting at the table with her two sons and a niece.
She had begun to stand up when the acid hit her face.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, her skin was searing. She ran outside. She howled for
help. By the time Afsaruddin was summoned, there was a small crowd
around her. He could make no sense of what he saw, he said. His
wife's face seemed to be ``dripping down her head.''
</P>
<P>
   The nearest clinic was 10 miles away. They climbed into a
bicycle rickshaw and commanded the man who was pedaling to go fast.
Afsaruddin recalls that he held his wife closely. She remembers
only the pain.
</P>
<P>
   When they reached the clinic, the doctor was dumbfounded. He had
never seen such an injury. He did not know what to do. He advised
them to go to Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
   Peyara did not get treatment for two days. There are only eight
beds for burn patients in all of Bangladesh, a nation of 128
million, said Dr. S.L. Sen of the Dhaka Medical College Hospital.
There are but six plastic surgeons in the country.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   She has since had six operations: skin grafts to her cheeks and
forehead, a reconstruction of her eyelids. Her sight is gone in one
eye and dimmed in the other. Aching is constant. She can tolerate
only the slightest amount of heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rakim must be punished for what he has done to my life,'' she
said firmly.
</P>
<P>
   But the young man's uncle, Motiullah, had suggested another path
to the village elders. His nephew's imprisonment would not remake
the woman's face, he said. And, even if it could, Rakimuddin's
conviction was no certainty. ``A just compensation is best for
everyone,'' he argued.
</P>
<P>
   A shaleesh is not bound by legalisms. There is no set
membership. Any interested men can observe it, though decisions are
usually left to a smaller group of elders.
</P>
<P>
   Moti Master presided. The meeting was very odd, he recalled.
Neither the jailed man nor the distraught husband, Afsaruddin, were
there. ``Afsaruddin's absence was very much felt,'' Moti Master
said. ``But I know him very well. He can be talked to. He can be
reasoned with.''
</P>
<P>
   So the shaleesh was assembled, and, after an hour, the old man
asked seven elders to go sit under the litchi tree and decide about
the money. He worried, he said. The judgment might be an
unrealistic sum. Rakimuddin's family was poor. How much could they
pay?
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the appointed jury was concerned about the same thing.
When some of them suggested that 500,000 takka _ about $10,000 _
was a fit penalty, others scoffed at such senselessness. Few people
around Gosarigaon could raise that much cash.
</P>
<P>
   Those on the other extreme, who thought $1,000 a fair payment,
also raised the question of improprieties: maybe Peyara had flirted
with the young tutor?
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought there might have been some kind of relationship
between the two,'' said Khander Abdul Mannan, who led the meeting
of the seven. ``We didn't know, but we assumed, perhaps this,
perhaps that. We thought Peyara might be partly responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Haggling ensued. The high end dropped to $4,000, the low moved
up to $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   The lesser amount had seemed about to prevail when someone
mentioned the couple's son, Awlad. His face had escaped injury, but
his body had been scarred.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why had this little child been made to suffer?'' Mannan said.
``Peyara may have shared in the blame but not this boy. We were
shocked and angry at this.''
</P>
<P>
   They finally agreed on appropriate reparations: $3,000.
</P>
<P>
   The process had taken up an entire afternoon, and the members of
the shaleesh were satisfied they had done the right thing.
</P>
<P>
   But Afsaruddin _ that bony and meek seller of cooked rice _
would not change his mind. He could not subdue his outrage. He
would not turn against his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Anwar Ali is president of the market where Afsaruddin has his
food stall. Ali is a prominent man. He attended Afsaruddin and
Peyara's wedding and considers himself their friend. But unlike
them, he had thought that deferring to the shaleesh was a smart
choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I urged him very hard to take the money,'' Ali recalled later,
sitting on a bench in the ramshackle market. ``Afsaruddin acted
like I was crazy. `What are you talking?' he said. `Have you seen
my wife's face? Have you seen my son?'''
</P>
<P>
   Ali paused a few seconds as he reflected on that conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little ashamed of myself,'' he said.

SOURCES SAY NTSB, KENNEDYS CLASHED AFTER JFK JR. CRASH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Amid reports that the National Transportation Safety
Board is expected to rule that pilot error by John F. Kennedy Jr.
caused the plane crash that killed him, his wife and her sister,
Washington sources claim the agency's handling of information
during the subsequent investigation caused friction between the
offices of Sen. Edward M. Kennedy and NTSB chairman James Hall.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulties first surfaced in the hours after Kennedy's
plane crashed, and became so pronounced that the White House
enlisted Cabinet secretary Thurgood Marshall Jr. to help facilitate
communications.
</P>
<P>
   The raw feelings from last summer burst to the forefront again
Friday after ``NBC Nightly News'' on Thursday reported the NTSB's
expected findings: That on July 16 John Kennedy Jr. became
disoriented in the murky night sky and lost control of the plane
off the coast of Martha's Vineyard. The report is scheduled to be
released next month.
</P>
<P>
   Like many relatives of loved ones who die in airplane crashes,
those close to the Kennedys felt the NTSB did not keep them up to
date on the search and investigation, the sources said. While NTSB
staffers _ including then-managing director Peter Goelz _ met
frequently with Kennedy staffers, preliminary agreements frequently
bogged down.
</P>
<P>
   One source said Goelz and US Coast Guard Rear Admiral Richard
Larrabee would return from meetings with the Kennedys only to find
``fencing'' inside the agency about how to handle queries from the
senator's office.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the difficulties stemmed from the flow of
communications, a Washington source said, adding that news
reporters sometimes got information about the search and
disseminated it before Senator Kennedy's office knew about it.
</P>
<P>
   Reached Friday, Senator Kennedy's spokesman, Will Keyser, had no
comment about the NTSB report or relations between the senator's
office and the NTSB.
</P>
<P>
   For someone like Senator Kennedy, a senior legislator who is
accustomed to getting questions answered quickly, the experience
may have been particularly painful, said a transportation source.
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB final report on the crash, prepared by regional
investigator Robert Pearce in Parsippany, N.J., was sent to NTSB
headquarters in Washington in the past few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Sources said that the report has been reviewed by fewer than six
people, among them chairman Hall _ the only one of five
presidentially appointed board members to see it _ and Aviation
Safety Chief Bernard Loeb and counsel Daniel Campbell. The NTSB did
not tell Kennedy's office about the general thrust of the final
report before it was leaked to the media, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Goelz, who is no longer with the NTSB, also refused to comment
Friday. And NTSB spokesman Ted Lopatkiewicz also would not talk
about the matter, adding that Hall was out of the country and could
not be reached.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the sensitive nature of investigating a crash in which
John Kennedy Jr. _ the celebrity son of a beloved president and
nephew of a powerful senator _ was at the controls, several sources
insist the NTSB did not alter the report to eliminate the phrase
``pilot error.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the agency, which investigates all aviation accidents
and recommends safety improvements does not use the phrase ``pilot
error'' in its investigations, transportation officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Two sources familiar with the investigation said the Kennedy
crash is unlikely to lead the NTSB to include any new safety
recommendations in the report, such as requiring pilots who fly at
night to be certified in reading instruments.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, who had more than 300 hours of flying time, was working
toward a rating that would have allowed him to fly the
single-engine plane by looking only at instruments, including an
indicator with an artificial horizon.
</P>
<P>
   Pilots use that instrument to prevent the effects of spatial
disorientation, a confusion resulting from an imbalance in the
inner ear. The condition leads pilots to believe they are flying
level when in fact the plane is out of control.
</P>
<P>
   There was nothing mechanically wrong with Kennedy's plane, which
had an autopilot that would have helped him keep the wings level
and slowly descend as he approached Martha's Vineyard, where his
sister-in-law Lauren Bessette was to get off. John Kennedy and his
wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, had planned to fly on to Hyannis
for the wedding of Kennedy's cousin, Rory.
</P>
<P>
   Two sources familiar with the investigation said it was unlikely
the report, which is still being reviewed, would fault Kennedy for
not using the autopilot.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how many times _ if at all _ Senator Kennedy and
Hall spoke directly to each other in the hours and days after the
accident. Some sources said a grief-stricken Kennedy was attending
to family matters and did not meet with NTSB or White House
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Though he was not the NTSB board member on call at the time,
Hall traveled to the scene in Cape Cod anyway, and gained national
exposure from frequent news conferences _ raising speculation in
Washington about his motives.
</P>
<P>
   Sources close to Hall, however, said he was not seeking
limelight; rather, he was nearby on Long Island for the anniversary
of the TWA Flight 800 disaster, and knew from the TWA investigation
that several different agencies would be involved in the Kennedy
crash investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Only the NTSB chairman or its managing director can immediately
ask other agencies for assistance, and Hall wanted to make sure the
crash team had every resource it needed. Still, there were concerns
over who would pay for the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Sources close to the investigation said the Coast Guard ordered
the Navy salvage vessel USS Grasp to the search site, but the NTSB
hesitated at paying for it. The White House eventually determined
that each agency should carry its own costs, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Once the White House got involved, Marshall and Andrew Cuomo _
secretary of Housing and Urban Development and husband of Kerry
Kennedy Cuomo _ became pivotal players. Cuomo, who was in Hyannis
for the family wedding, quickly became a liaison, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the difficulties in communication, there were moments
when everything clicked, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   One transportation source said that on July 23, when a memorial
service was held in New York City for Kennedy, his wife and
sister-in-law, the USS Grasp had completed its salvage work. The
ship was initially scheduled to dock during the memorial service,
but NTSB and Navy officials agreed to keep it at sea during the
service.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a caustic exchange with a senior Justice
Department prosecutor two months ago, Vice President Al Gore denied
being told by aides that a 1996 luncheon at a Buddhist temple was a
fund-raising event, according to a transcript of the interview that
the vice president's lawyers released Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sure as hell don't recall having _ I sure as hell did not
have any conversations with anyone saying this is a fund-raising
event,'' Gore testified.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's angry denial was contained in a 123-page transcript of a
four-hour interview in which the head of the Justice Department's
campaign finance unit questioned Gore at the vice presidential
mansion about his fund-raising activities prior to the 1996
election.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president disclosed the interview transcript Friday
afternoon, scrambling to blunt the potential damage of the revived
Justice Department inquiry of his truthfulness in answering
questions about his efforts to raise money. ``I have always
cooperated fully,'' Gore told reporters aboard Air Force II Friday
afternoon, as he flew from Denver to Palo Alto, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have admitted that I have made mistakes in fund raising,''
he said in the middle of a chaotic day in which he and his aides
sought to contain the latest problem to engulf his presidential
campaign. ``But I want the American people to know that I have
always told the truth on this matter. I have always cooperated
fully. And I want the entire transcript to be out there and I want
people to be able to judge it for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Gore said, ``I think the truth is my friend in this. The
truth, the full truth and nothing but the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   In the April interview, Gore was confronted with questions about
a wide array of campaign finance issues, posed by a clearly
skeptical and at times incredulous prosecutor, Robert Conrad , the
head of the campaign finance task force. Besides the Buddhist
temple luncheon, Gore was asked whether the White House coffees
were fund-raising events and, more recently, what he knew about
missing e-mail messages from his office.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's decision to release the transcript came one day after the
Justice Department confirmed that Conrad had recommended that
Attorney General Janet Reno appoint a special counsel to
investigate the truthfulness of Gore's statements about his
political fund raising.
</P>
<P>
   But the vice president also questioned the timing of the
disclosure of the new inquiry. ``Here we are four months before an
election that takes place every four years,'' Gore told reporters.
``You can read into that what you want to.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas Friday seized on the renewed
inquiry of Gore's fund-raising activities. ``I reiterate my call
for a new tone in Washington which is going to require a new
administration in Washington,'' Bush said. ``People are sick and
tired of all this stuff and the best way to start anew is with a
new administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has clearly made the political calculation that the public
will view the transcript, filled with questions about events that
occurred as long ago as 1989, as old news.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have full confidence in the judgment of the American
people,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's answers during the April 18 interview at times appeared
to conflict with conclusions reached by a 1997 inquiry by a Senate
panel that investigated campaign finance inquiries. But Gore
dismissed its report as ``a highly partisan document.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Gore insisted that the 103 White House coffees
held in 1995 and 1996 with campaign donors were not ``fund-raising
tools'' used to raise money for the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate panel, led by Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., found in
1997 that supporters who had attended the coffee events between
November 1995 and October 1996 contributed a total of $7.7 million
within one month of having attended the coffees.
</P>
<P>
   During the questioning, Gore recalled that he had remembered
``only one that I attended briefly.'' But the Senate panel found
that he had hosted 23 coffees and attended eight with President
Clinton. Confronted with the contradictory information about the
coffees, Gore said, ``That seems inaccurate to me.''
</P>
<P>
   As a legal matter, Gore's apparent misstatements may fall short
of sufficient grounds to show that Gore illegally perjured himself,
a law enforcement official said Friday. That is one reason, the
officials said, Reno has, so far, shown no sign that she is
prepared to refer the case to an outside prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, after searing internal battles in 1997 and 1998, refused
to seek an independent counsel to investigate Gore's fund-raising
efforts over the objections of some of her senior advisers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Still, Conrad is not alone in his recommendation to refer the
case to a special prosecutor, the officials said Friday. FBI
Director Louis Freeh also favors a special counsel and has long
urged Reno to do so.
</P>
<P>
   During the interview with Gore, Conrad led the questioning,
assisted by two FBI agents. Conrad devoted a majority of the
four-hour interview to Gore's understanding of the true purpose of
the Buddhist temple event, a subject that Gore had not been asked
about in his four previous interviews with federal investigators
from the campaign finance unit.
</P>
<P>
   Conrad repeatedly showed Gore numerous memos _ all of which had
been made public years ago _ from aides that suggested that it was
known that the event was intended to raise money.
</P>
<P>
   ``You were aware in late February, were you not, that there was
a goal of raising $108 million by the DNC?'' Conrad asked,
referring to Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' the vice president answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then a couple of months later there is a DNC-sponsored event
at the temple and it didn't raise any fund-raising issues in your
mind?'' Conrad went on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not know this was a fund-raiser,'' Gore answered.
</P>
<P>
   But later in the interview, Gore inadvertently referred to the
temple event as a ``fund-raiser.'' The vice president's personal
lawyer, James F. Neal, quickly advised Gore that he had misspoken.
</P>
<P>
   Neal told the vice president, ``I thought you said previously
you didn't, you still don't know whether it was a fund-raiser.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore then replied, ``Well, that's right. That is more accurate.
Let me, let me amend that. That was first time it was alleged to
be, to have been a fund-raiser.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hsi Lai event, held on April 29, 1996 in Hacienda Heights,
Calif., was one of the most embarrassing episodes of the 1996
campaign finance scandal. The event was organized by Maria Hsia, a
longtime friend and political ally of the vice president who had
collected money before the event from monks and nuns, some of whom
had taken vows of poverty.
</P>
<P>
   As a tax exempt religious institution, the temple was not
allowed to serve as a venue for political fund raising or itself to
make political donations. Gore was asked repeatedly in late 1996
and 1997 about his knowledge of whether the event was a
fund-raiser, and according to Conrad responded with differing
statements.
</P>
<P>
   Hsia was convicted in March for hiding $109,000 in illegal
contributions and making false statements to federal regulators
about the temple luncheon. She is awaiting sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   Gore insisted that he did not learn that the luncheon was used
to raise money until several months after it had occurred. In
between, he said in numerous interviews with the press that he
understood the luncheon was a ``community outreach event.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no solicitation of money,'' Gore said. ``I did not
see any money or checks change hands. I never heard it discussed.
Nor do I believe it took place, incidentally.''
</P>
<P>
   He told Conrad, ``Perhaps you know that some money changed hands
there. But to this day, I don't think any did.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday at the Justice Department, Reno acknowledged that
prosecutors had embarked on a renewed investigation of Gore's
statements under oath about his political fund-raising practices
during the 1996 presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at her weekly news conference, Reno said that she would
ignore the inflamed partisan passions surrounding the election year
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing in any investigation, particularly in
this time of year, is that we conduct an investigation the right
way, not in the headlines, not with pressure from people who may
have differing views but just do it right _ methodically,
carefully, without commenting on it _ and get it done as quickly as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats sought to shift the spotlight to the background and
possible motives of Conrad, the head of the Justice Department's
campaign finance task force who made the special counsel
recommendation late last week.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1996, while working as a federal prosecutor in
Charlotte, N.C., Conrad contributed $250 to Sen. Jesse Helms,
R-N.C., Federal Election Commission reports show. Democrats said
the contribution raised questions about his political motives in
his inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews Friday, several senior Justice Department
officials defended Conrad's impartiality and said there was no
basis to believe that his legal judgments were politically
motivated.

GORE ORDERS RELEASE OF FUNDRAISING PROBE INTERVIEW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES AND JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore hotly denied knowing that
his 1996 appearance at a Buddhist temple in California was a
fund-raiser, saying, ``I sure as hell don't recall'' having any
conversations that the event was to raise money, according to a
transcript of his interview with federal prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Gore ordered his lawyer Friday to release the 150-page
transcript of the April interview after reports Thursday that the
new head of a Justice Department task force on campaign
fund-raising had recommended the appointment of an independent
counsel to investigate Gore's answers about his 1996 fund-raising
activities.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with the prospect that his presidential campaign might be
damaged by the fresh attention on his role in raising money for
President Clinton's reelection campaign, Gore launched a
counteroffensive, telling reporters aboard his plane, ``I want the
truth to be known about this. I've told the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday, political observers speculated that Gore may have
already suffered political damage from the disclosure that a
special prosecutor had been recommended _ even if one is never
appointed. But the vice president's supporters denounced the
motives of the Republican senator who announced that Robert Conrad,
the supervising attorney for the task force, had made the
recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno Friday promised to conduct a
thorough review of the case before deciding whether to accept
Conrad's recommendation. But sensitive to the backdrop of
election-year politics, she also made clear that she wanted to act
quickly to not ``interfere with the democratic process.''
</P>
<P>
   The questions in the April 18 interview with Gore focused
primarily on his appearance at the Hsi Lai Temple in Los Angeles,
though Conrad and two FBI agents who assisted also touched briefly
on the White House fund-raising ``coffees'' and the batches of
e-mails missing from the vice president's office.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was also asked about his relationship with Maria Hsia, a
longtime friend of the vice president's, who was convicted in March
of hiding $109,000 in illegal contributions and then lying to
federal regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Hsia had accepted contributions from nuns and monks at the
temple, then reimbursed them with temple funds. As a tax-exempt
organization, the temple is not allowed to make poltiical
contributions. Hsia is awaiting sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   In often-testy exchanges occasionlly broken up by what appeared
to be forced levity, Gore denied knowing that the event at the
Buddhist Temple was a fund-raiser. He insisted he did not recall
having any conversations with his staff about the temple event
before leaving to attend it. Asked repeatedly about any
conversations he might have had with anyone _ staff or not _ about
the trip, Gore bristled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sure as hell don't recall having _ I sure as hell did not
have any conversatons with anyone saying, this is a fund-raising
event,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As to whether or not I had any follow-up conversations that
said, were we able to set up this event or not, I don't think I
did. But I may have.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``only connection'' Gore had to the possibility that the
temple event was a fund-raiser was that ``members of a
finance-related event were present at the event,'' the vice
president said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not know that it was a fund-raiser,'' Gore insisted.
``And I do not know to this day that it was a fund-raiser.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore was shown letters and memos that suggest the temple event
might have a fund-raising component. While Gore admitted he knew
finance officials from the Democratic National Committee were
involved with the event, he did not view it as a fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   Traveling Friday on Air Force Two to San Francisco from Denver,
Gore said he has always told the truth, always cooperated with
investigators and wanted to provide the transcript so people could
judge for themselves. He also acknowledged having ``made mistakes
in fund-raising.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the truth is my friend in this,'' said Gore. ``The
full truth and nothing but the truth. I don't want people to have
the impression that I'm trying to hide anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore suggested more than once that the timing of the leak about
the recommendation was suspicious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here we are, four months before a national election that takes
place once every four years,'' he said, declining to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic sources sought to paint Conrad as a partisan, saying
that he had contributed $250 to the 1996 reelection campaign of
Senator Jesse Helms, a North Carolina Republican, and that he once
had been hired by a former Helms aide, Tom Ashcraft, who was US
attorney in North Carolina at the time, to be an assistant US
attorney in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Sources close to Reno say she is upset that Conrad's
recommendation _ made weeks ago and a closely guarded secret at the
Justice Department _ was leaked to Senator Arlen Specter, a
Pennsylvania Republican, who told reporters about it Thursday.
Specter is chairman of a Senate Judiciary subcommittee, and Conrad
had testified Wednesday to the panel without disclosing whether he
had made a recommendation for a special prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Specter's role came under criticism from Chris Lehane, Gore's
press secretary, who said, ``Arlen Specter has virtually turned the
United States Senate into George W. Bush's press office. We're not
going to put up with that kind of political skullduggery and dirty
tricks.''
</P>
<P>
   Some sources close to the Justice Department said the
recommendation of Conrad, who came to the job six months ago, is a
continuation of a long-running internal feud over whether an
independent counsel should be appointed to investigate Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, who suggested that the leak was an attempt to pressure her
into asking that an independent counsel be named, is conducing an
internal investigation over how the leak occurred. ``The worse
thing you can do in an investigation is dribble it out, piece by
piece, without presenting the whole and without completing the
whole,'' Reno said. ``I don't want to present half-facts.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno has twice rejected recommendations that an independent
counsel investigate Gore _ once for making fund-raising phone calls
from his White House office and once for possible false statements
about those calls. She alone can decided whether to seek a special
prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I want to do is to complete the overall investigation as
expeditously as possible, be accountable as much as I possibly can,
make the best decision I can, make it free of pressure from
anybody, so that at least the American people can understand that
the decision was made in the best manner I could and not by other
people dictating or pressuring me into making the decision,'' Reno
said at her weekly meeting with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``But nothing should be rushed, because too often, when we rush
to justice, we don't get it,'' Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   About the same time Reno spoke, George W. Bush, the Republican
presidential candidate, said questions about Gore's fund-raising
are ``indicative of what has gone on'' in the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are sick and tired of all this stuff,'' the Texas
governor said at a campaign stop in Alabama. ``The best way to make
sure that it doesn't happen again is to start with a new
administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas E. Mann, director of governmental studies at the
Brookings Institution, said rather than appoint an independent
counsel, Reno should leave the matter to voters in the November
election.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she appoints a special counsel, all it does is put a cloud
over Gore without sufficient time to resolve it,'' Mann said.
``This would be a death sentence, the capstone of the
criminalization of politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Rozell, a professor of politics at Catholic University in
Washington, said there appeared to be no new revelations, but an
old story being kept alive was bad news for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``These allegations will divert his attention in his campaign
away from his own message into defending himself,'' Rozell said.
``There's an old saying in politics, when you are explaining,
you're losing _ and he has explaining to do.''

(ATTN: N.C.)  
 CAMPAIGN-FINANCE INVESTIGATOR IS PRAISED FOR SKILL 
</HEADLINE>
  (With GORE-FUNDRAISING) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Attorney General Janet Reno appointed Robert
Conrad to direct the Justice Department's campaign finance task
force late last year, she praised his prosecutorial skills and said
she expected him to ``expand upon the successes'' of the campaign
finance inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Barely six months later, Conrad handed her a political hot
potato by recommending that she appoint an independent counsel to
investigate Vice President Al Gore's involvement in fund raising
for the 1996 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Conrad, 42, earned a reputation as a skilled prosecutor and
trial attorney during more than 10 years in the U.S. attorney's
office in Charlotte, N.C., those who have worked with him say. From
1992 until last year, Conrad was chief of the office's criminal
division.
</P>
<P>
   Conrad's former boss in Charlotte, U.S. Attorney Mark Calloway,
called Conrad one of the most capable prosecutors he had ever
worked with. ``He is a relentless investigator and has a high sense
of duty and fairness,'' Calloway said when Conrad was appointed to
the Justice Department post in December.
</P>
<P>
   A former North Carolina attorney general, Lacy H. Thornburg,
praised Conrad's courtroom skills. ``Bob is a seasoned prosecutor
and skilled trial attorney,'' Thornburg said.
</P>
<P>
   But Democratic officials on Friday questioned Conrad's
impartiality, noting that he had contributed $250 in 1996 to the
re-election campaign of Sen. Jesse Helms of North Carolina, a
staunch conservative Republican and a consistent foe of the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   The donation to Helms is apparently the only political
contribution Conrad has ever made, according to federal election
records.
</P>
<P>
   Conrad went to work for the U.S. attorney's office in 1989. Tom
Ashcraft, then the U.S. attorney, had been a member of Helms'
Senate staff and served on the board of the Jesse Helms Center, a
foundation controlled by the senator. He was appointed to the U.S.
attorney's post by President Ronald Reagan in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Conrad is a graduate of the University of Virginia Law School
and Clemson University, where he was a basketball star and an
academic all-American.
</P>
<P>
   Reno established the campaign finance task force in 1996 to
investigate accusations of illegality in the 1996 presidential
campaign. The task force has indicted 22 people over the last four
years for campaign finance abuses.

A U.S. PULLOUT ISN'T PLANNED IN SOUTH KOREA, ALBRIGHT SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ Trying to dampen speculation that the
prospects of reconciliation on the Korean Peninsula would lead to a
smaller U.S. military presence in South Korea, Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright stressed Friday that U.S. troops would not be
withdrawn any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   With Foreign Minister Lee Joung-binn of South Korea at her side,
Albright said that talk of reducing U.S. troops was ``not
appropriate'' and ``premature'' and that the troops would continue
to be a deterrent against North Korea and a stabilizing force in
the region.
</P>
<P>
   Lee said even if the two Koreas agreed to end the Korean War
with a peace treaty, U.S. troops would ``continue to play their
role as a guarantor of the balance of power.''
</P>
<P>
   The first senior administration official to visit South Korea
after the summit meeting last week between the North and South
Korean leaders, Albright arrived here to learn more about what
occurred and to establish Washington's interests as the
reconciliation unfolds. She met President Kim Dae-jung and then
Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Albright's presence also put a spotlight on the 37,000 U.S.
troops here and what role they might have in the future. Protests
have been growing for several months at a U.S. Air Force bombing
range 50 miles southwest of the capital.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference with Albright, Lee said Kim had told his
North Korean counterpart, Kim Jong Il, at their meeting that he
wanted U.S. troops to stay in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that we have expanded the North Korean
understanding on this particular issue,'' Lee said. ``The American
forces will be needed here even after the establishment of a peace
regime on the Korean Peninsula.''
</P>
<P>
   The nature of the North Korean leader's reply has remained
somewhat unclear and was not clarified at the news conference. In
the last several days, however, administration officials said they
had been pleased that Kim Dae-jung had raised the question of U.S.
troops at the Pyongyang meeting and suggested that the North Korean
leader's response did not appear to be unsatisfactory.
</P>
<P>
   One administration official with knowledge of post-summit
briefings by senior South Korean officials said the North Korean
leader had indicated that he was not eager to have the U.S. troops
leave South Korea. It is possible, the official said, to draw a
very rough analogy from the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, when
the Soviet Union did not push for the pullout of U.S. troops from
West Germany.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea might be content to see a continued U.S. military
presence, the official said, albeit in a different mode, to ensure
that a vacuum was not created as changes occurred over what could a
drawn-out reunification.
</P>
<P>
   Another U.S. official said when the South Korean president told
Kim Jong Il that he wanted U.S. troops to remain as reunification
progressed, the North Korean indicated that he ``was not totally
opposed to this,'' the official said, recounting a briefing that
South Korean government had given him.
</P>
<P>
   The success of the Pyongyang summit meeting caught U.S. policy
makers off guard. In the days since then, they have confronted
unanticipated questions in public and private about the role of
U.S. troops. In Washington, questions abut the size and components
of the military presence are being raised.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, officials are stressing that the meeting, as
Albright said Friday, was promising, but had not resolved anything.
</P>
<P>
   In answer to a South Korean reporter's question, Albright said:
``We have alliance structures with Japan and South Korea. We don't
put a time limit on our responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. military role in the South has changed in the last
decade. The troops have moved from a leading to a supporting role
in defense. But the South Korean government has continued to argue
that its own forces could not deter an invasion from North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Albright also tried to emphasize that the United States had its
own channels to North Korea. She said that Washington would soon
reopen talks with North Korea aimed at curbing its missile
development and that it had just completed a round of talks in Rome
with North Korea on ensuring that its nuclear program is for
civilian use only.

   Dennis Miller on Monday Night Football?
</P>
<P>
   Don't laugh yet. It's been tried before.
</P>
<P>
   Dandy Don Meredith left ``Monday Night Football'' after the 1974
season, and producer Don Olhmeyer wanted to hire Bill Cosby to
replace him. Cosby had played football at Temple University and
Ohlymeyer said he believed Cosby would have been perfect. But the
deal never happened. Nor did a possible deal with Burt Reynolds.
Ohlmeyer ended up hiring ex-player Alex Karras.
</P>
<P>
   Before all the sports purists get further lathered up, ``Monday
Night Football'' has always been about entertainment. The naming of
Miller, the former member of ``Saturday Night Live'' and current
HBO host, is only the latest attempt to attract casual observers to
ABC.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, it was announced that Miller would join Al Michaels
and Dan Fouts in the broadcasting booth.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Gunther, co-author of ``Monday Night Mayhem,'' a 1988
account of the NFL's showcase game, said the hiring of Miller
symbolizes a return to the show's roots.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Roone Arledge created the show in 1970, the whole notion
was to create a program that appealed to the casual fan,'' Gunther
said. ``It's a smart thing to hire Miller. The show had lost track
of it's history of going for marquee names, the guys that were
bigger than sports.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the purists don't want to hear any of that
entertainment stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's weird,'' said Peter King, NFL analyst for CNN/SI. ``I
can't believe the NFL is very happy about Dennis Miller being on
it's showcase game. We're not taking about a football game anymore.
There are probably some (NFL team) owners like (Dallas's) Jerry
Jones or (New England's) Bob Kraft who are excited about the
possibility of earning huge ratings and more television money. Then
there are the other NFL owners who remain purists at heart who are
probably throwing up somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The question is not whether sports is entertainment, but whether
hiring Miller is enough to reverse the almost epidemic hemorrhaging
of viewers. For ``Monday Night Football,'' the loss is particularly
acute among males 18-34, many of whom are glued to professional
wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's desperation,'' said Robert Thompson, a Syracuse
University professor of television and film. ``It is a stunt to
attract viewers and rekindle the glory days of the 1970s when the
action in the booth was more exciting than on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Those days are long gone. With more channels, more sports, more
outrageousness, the hiring of a comedian barely makes a ripple,
especially considering that the smart-ass sports commentator is the
most duplicated schtick in America.
</P>
<P>
   NBC Sports chairman Dick Ebersol joked that he was glad the
search was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God the monumentally important hunt for `MNF' talent is
over and at last newspapers everywhere can get back to the vital
task of finding the Lindberg baby,'' said Ebersol, who himself is
looking to boost ratings next year by launching a new football
league with World Wrestling Federation president Vince McMahon.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone was insouciant. Talk radio shows hummed with
outrage over Miller's hiring. Just as plentiful were tempered
comments of praise. Of the 14,000 respondents to a CNN/SI poll, 30
percent said hiring Miller was a terrible idea, 28 percent said
wait and see, 22 percent said it was a great idea, and 20 percent
said at least it is not Rush Limbaugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look back at what the sports media critics wrote
about Howard Cosell, it was horrible,'' said Bill Carter, a New
York Times television writer and co-author of ``Monday Night
Mayhem.'' ``But hiring a (non-football) person was an innovation of
the '70s that has been done and redone. The challenge for them is
to keep the diehards and the causal fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Straight football hasn't worked. Dan Dierdorf played football,
as did Boomer Esiason, but neither struck a chord with viewers.
Television ratings for ``Monday Night Football'' reached a peak in
1981 with a 21.8 average rating (or about 21 million households).
That number has steadily declined to a 13.7 rating last season.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with strong competition from professional wrestling on
cable and network shows such as Fox's ``Ally McBeal'' and CBS's
``Everybody Loves Raymond,'' ``Monday Night Football'' lost almost
20 percent of its male viewers last year between 18 and 34. CBS and
Fox have been able to stay even, or grow slightly, in that
important demographic. The statistics also show that the three
networks with football coverage are basically attracting the same
percentage of male and female viewers.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, no one is standing out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It remains to be seen whether the on-air talent can have an
impact on the ratings,'' said Neil Pilson, the former CBS Sports
president. ``Most people tune into a game because of a matchup. ABC
wasn't lucky last year. They are hoping that Miller appeals to the
younger, hipper viewers.''
</P>
<P>
   The NFL, for one, is hoping that the entertainment strategy
works. NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said that a few months ago NFL
commissioner Paul Tagliabue told him ``Monday Night Football'' had
to be more entertaining because it was on in prime time.
</P>
<P>
   ``He believes that `MNF' has to be more than just Xs and Os,
more than graphics and statistics and more entertaining,'' said
Aiello, who described the Miller hiring as ``inspiring.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox officials agreed hiring Miller was a great idea. The network
took a chance last year and hired Jimmy Kimmel, a regular on Comedy
Central and host of a Los Angeles radio show. When he first
appeared on Fox's Emmy Award-winning pregame show with James Brown,
Terry Bradshaw, Cris Collinsworth, and Howie Long, viewers sent
angry letters to the network asking why.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's entertainment,'' said Scott Ackerson, a Fox Sports
coordinating producer. ``We took a lot of heat on Kimmel but it
worked out fine. At the end of the year, people told us that they
thought he was funny. It really is about entertainment, pure and
simple.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the blowout games last year on ``Monday Night Football,''
including the San Francisco 49ers-Atlanta Falcons matchup when both
teams were out of playoff contention, entertainment might be the
show's saving grace.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you did television for the purists, you would get a 2
rating,'' Ackerson said. ``What you want to have is when the game
is a blowout, people still hang around. When the game is close,
anyone could call it. But they might hang on longer if it's
entertaining. Hey, my hat is off to ABC for stepping up and doing
something.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether ABC's gamble is successful remains to be seen. A lot
depends on the quality of the games. A lot also depends on Miller,
who arguably started the smart-ass style copied by ESPN anchors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if this is going to work,'' said Robertson. ``In
the '70s, there were only two other choices and `Monday Night
Football' was more of a variety show with football in the
background. Nowadays there are hundreds of other options for people
who don't watch sports. Maybe Miller can stem the flow. He is
enough of a loose-cannon and unpredictable character that viewers
might tune in just to see what he says. But I'm worried that the
television audience will continue to leave regardless of who is in
the booth. Hiring a comedian was a great stunt for the old
networks. It's not for the modern-day cable universe.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller, 47, is undaunted. Known for his caustic wit on ``Dennis
Miller Live'' on HBO -- ``I don't want to get off on a rant'' or
``Of course, that's just my opinion, I could be wrong'' -- Miller
readily concedes that he was a ``quirky hire.'' He also explained
that he knows what it's like to follow in the footsteps of a
legend. Miller came after Chevy Chase as the weekend anchor on
``Saturday Night Live.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't Chevy Chase and I'm not going to be Howard Cosell,''
Miller said. ``I don't know football broadcasting, but I know how
to work in front of a camera and I will (work hard) coming up with
lots of information. I'll do the best I can, but I can only be me.
I can't change.''

MASS TRANSIT FARE RAISED IN ATLANTA TO EXPAND SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: No byline) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After a long struggle to balance the need for
expanding transit farther into the suburbs against the goal of
keeping fares low, a $12 million deficit has forced metro Atlanta's
public transit officials to make a choice: expansion.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the board of directors of the Metropolitan Atlanta
Rapid Transit Authority agreed to raise fares by 25 cents to
finance the system's growth farther into the northern suburbs.
Marta officials say the $1.75 fare, which takes effect on Jan. 1,
is needed to pay for two new rail stations opening in suburban
north Fulton County. The increase is the first since 1995, and puts
the cost at the upper end of urban transit systems around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The expanded rail and bus service is intended to relieve some of
the region's notorious traffic congestion, along with a smog
problem that has become one of the worst of any U.S. metropolitan
area.
</P>
<P>
   The addition of five new rail stations since 1995, special buses
for the disabled, and the expansion of Marta's police force and
station staff have forced the agency into the red in recent years,
said Marta spokeswoman Dee Baker.
</P>
<P>
   Though half the construction cost of the new stations was paid
with federal funds, Marta relies for the rest on fare revenue and a
1-cent sales tax from the service areas: the city of Atlanta,
DeKalb and Fulton counties. Marta receives no money from the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are probably one of the only regions in the country that
does not have a state transportation fund,'' Baker said, adding
that this is unlikely to change in the near future. ``In the short
term, the only real alternative to the fare increase would be a
decrease in service.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency had considered cutting back on bus service instead of
a fare increase.
</P>
<P>
   Many riders and transit advocates in Atlanta argue that the fare
increase unjustly targets the poorest residents of the city, who
use the system most.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bullard, head of an urban policy research group at Clark
Atlanta University, says the fare increase favors the predominantly
white ridership from the suburbs over low-income minorities in the
city of Atlanta.

AFTER AN ATTACK, CHINESE WON'T PRINT EXPATRIATE'S NOVEL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., Ill.)   By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ A major Chinese publisher has canceled its plans to
translate and publish the celebrated novel ``Waiting,'' by the
Chinese-born emigre Ha Jin, after a harsh attack in a literary
review here denouncing the book as an attempt to portray China as
backward and repressive.
</P>
<P>
   People involved in book publishing here said they did not
believe that official censors had directly ordered government-owned
Beijing Publishing Group, whose editors had effusively praised the
novel earlier, to drop its plans.
</P>
<P>
   But they said the reversal reflected an increasingly repressive
climate over the last year in which some earthy works of fiction as
well as many books on politics and history have been banned,
causing publishers to fear losing their investments, and perhaps
their licenses, if they stick their necks out.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very sensitive time for publishers,'' said a leading
book editor who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ``They've
received a lot of instructions from above saying to be careful
about what books get printed. So if a book is publicly criticized,
they don't know where it may lead and they don't want to take the
risk.''
</P>
<P>
   The Beijing house, which says it prints some 1,300 books a year,
including more than 100 bought abroad, had a verbal agreement to
secure the Chinese rights from Pantheon Books in New York, a
division of Random House, for a negligible advance of $800, said
Pantheon officials and Jin, who is a professor of English at Emory
University in Atlanta. It had already engaged a translator who was
more than half finished when the nationalistic attack on the novel
appeared on June 14. The essay was by a Beijing University
literature professor with a doctorate from the University of
Chicago Within a few days of that article, an editor informed Jin
that the deal was off because the executives at the publishing
house feared controversy, said Jin.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happened at the Beijing publisher _ its chief editor
insisted in an interview Friday that the decision not to go ahead
was routine business _ there had been earlier signs that China's
culture czars were frowning.
</P>
<P>
   There had been months of ominous silence in the Chinese media
about the fairy tale success of Jin, 44, a onetime soldier who
moved to the United States in 1985, received a doctorate in
literature from Brandeis and writes in English. Jin received the
National Book Award for 1999 and this year's Pen/Faulkner Award for
``Waiting,'' his second novel.
</P>
<P>
   Some Chinese reporters told him that they had been ordered not
to write about the book, said Jin, who is a U.S. citizen. This
suggests that the near-universal shunning of the novel here by
newspapers and on television was ordered by the Communist Party's
powerful propaganda department, which controls all publications.
Quite often, Chinese who find success overseas are subjects of
fascination in Chinese newspapers and television programs.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly why the novel should worry China's culture watchdogs is
not obvious. Set in China over a recent two-decade period that
includes Mao's Cultural Revolution from 1966 to 1976, it portrays
the emotional yearnings, paralysis and development of a military
doctor who finds himself unable to divorce his peasant wife from
his home village and, at the same time, sees the shriveling of love
with the nurse he has promised one day to marry.
</P>
<P>
   While Communist repression is the realistic backdrop, and
certainly conditions the inner lives of the characters, the book is
far less harsh in its portrayal of the Cultural Revolution than
others that have been freely printed here.
</P>
<P>
   But the acclaim in the United States appears to be stirring
complex reactions among the relatively small group that even knows
about it here.
</P>
<P>
   ``This book is not about politics,'' Jin said Friday in his own
defense. ``It's about the human heart, about human flaws and the
sinister nature of time.''
</P>
<P>
   The June 14 essay, which was written by Liu Yiqing of Beijing
University and appeared in the influential weekly Chinese Reading
News, viciously attacks the motives of Jin, the American press and
the critics who praised his work. Her essay treats the novel not as
a work of literature but as, as she seems to feel, a disguised
polemic.
</P>
<P>
   To further his literary ambitions, Liu charges, Jin was forced
``to curse his own compatriots and to become a tool used by the
American media to vilify China.''
</P>
<P>
   Jin's depiction of an extremely rustic peasant wife with bound
feet, Liu said, is an anachronism intended ``to emphasize the
backwardness of China.'' The resistance of fellow villagers to his
request for a divorce, she said, is meant to show that Chinese do
not appreciate love.
</P>
<P>
   Even the cover of the U.S. edition of the book, which features a
single braid of hair down the length of the cover, is castigated.
Liu said it was a male pigtail, a symbol of the feudal era, and
that all the critics and newspapers who propelled ``Waiting''
toward big prizes did so not because of its supposedly elegant
writing but because it met their goal of portraying the Chinese as
ignorant and repressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all outrageous,'' commented Jin, hardly containing
himself. ``She thinks I played tricks to please Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   The bound feet, he said, were present in the real-life story he
heard years ago that inspired the novel. ``But anyway, this is a
work of fiction,'' he said. ``The novel has its own logic, and it
needs a character like her.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the cover art, Jin said the artist intended to portray a
woman's braid, in a layout evoking the passage of time and a hint
of eroticism.
</P>
<P>
   The Beijing book editor who spoke anonymously said that some
Chinese intellectuals and officials had often reacted negatively to
literary works by Chinese authors published overseas, recalling
``Wild Swans: Three Daughters of China,'' a memoir by Jung Chang
that won acclaim abroad but was attacked here and never published.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like an anti-Western syndrome,'' Jin said. Such critics,
he said, argue that overseas authors ``deserted their own country,
and even wrote in a different language.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Friday, the chief editor at Beijing Publishing
Group, Long Jie, said it was a coincidence that the company had
decided against publishing ``Waiting'' just after it was attacked
in print here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the right to choose or not choose a book; this is a
very normal thing,'' she said. ``Often we contact a foreign
publisher, and if we feel the price is not reasonable then we won't
sign.'' In this case, she added, there were ``many reasons'' for
not proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   Jin said that of the $800 payment, 25 percent would have gone to
Random House.

University professor of television and film. ``It is a stunt to
attract viewers and rekindle the glory days of the 1970s when the
action in the booth was more exciting than on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Those days are long gone. With more channels, more sports, more
outrageousness, the hiring of a comedian barely makes a ripple,
especially considering that the smart-ass sports commentator is the
most duplicated schtick in America.
</P>
<P>
   NBC Sports chairman Dick Ebersol joked that he was glad the
search was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God the monumentally important hunt for `MNF' talent is
over and at last newspapers everywhere can get back to the vital
task of finding the Lindberg baby,'' said Ebersol, who himself is
looking to boost ratings next year by launching a new football
league with World Wrestling Federation president Vince McMahon.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone was insouciant. Talk radio shows hummed with
outrage over Miller's hiring. Just as plentiful were tempered
comments of praise. Of the 14,000 respondents to a CNN/SI poll, 30
percent said hiring Miller was a terrible idea, 28 percent said
wait and see, 22 percent said it was a great idea, and 20 percent
said at least it is not Rush Limbaugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look back at what the sports media critics wrote
about Howard Cosell, it was horrible,'' said Bill Carter, a New
York Times television writer and co-author of ``Monday Night
Mayhem.'' ``But hiring a (non-football) person was an innovation of
the '70s that has been done and redone. The challenge for them is
to keep the diehards and the causal fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Straight football hasn't worked. Dan Dierdorf played football,
as did Boomer Esiason, but neither struck a chord with viewers.
Television ratings for ``Monday Night Football'' reached a peak in
1981 with a 21.8 average rating (or about 21 million households).
That number has steadily declined to a 13.7 rating last season.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with strong competition from professional wrestling on
cable and network shows such as Fox's ``Ally McBeal'' and CBS's
``Everybody Loves Raymond,'' ``Monday Night Football'' lost almost
20 percent of its male viewers last year between 18 and 34. CBS and
Fox have been able to stay even, or grow slightly, in that
important demographic. The statistics also show that the three
networks with football coverage are basically attracting the same
percentage of male and female viewers.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, no one is standing out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It remains to be seen whether the on-air talent can have an
impact on the ratings,'' said Neil Pilson, the former CBS Sports
president. ``Most people tune into a game because of a matchup. ABC
wasn't lucky last year. They are hoping that Miller appeals to the
younger, hipper viewers.''
</P>
<P>
   The NFL, for one, is hoping that the entertainment strategy
works. NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said that a few months ago NFL
commissioner Paul Tagliabue told him ``Monday Night Football'' had
to be more entertaining because it was on in prime time.
</P>
<P>
   ``He believes that `MNF' has to be more than just Xs and Os,
more than graphics and statistics and more entertaining,'' said
Aiello, who described the Miller hiring as ``inspiring.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox officials agreed hiring Miller was a great idea. The network
took a chance last year and hired Jimmy Kimmel, a regular on Comedy
Central and host of a Los Angeles radio show. When he first
appeared on Fox's Emmy Award-winning pregame show with James Brown,
Terry Bradshaw, Cris Collinsworth, and Howie Long, viewers sent
angry letters to the network asking why.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's entertainment,'' said Scott Ackerson, a Fox Sports
coordinating producer. ``We took a lot of heat on Kimmel but it
worked out fine. At the end of the year, people told us that they
thought he was funny. It really is about entertainment, pure and
simple.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the blowout games last year on ``Monday Night Football,''
including the San Francisco 49ers-Atlanta Falcons matchup when both
teams were out of playoff contention, entertainment might be the
show's saving grace.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you did television for the purists, you would get a 2
rating,'' Ackerson said. ``What you want to have is when the game
is a blowout, people still hang around. When the game is close,
anyone could call it. But they might hang on longer if it's
entertaining. Hey, my hat is off to ABC for stepping up and doing
something.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether ABC's gamble is successful remains to be seen. A lot
depends on the quality of the games. A lot also depends on Miller,
who arguably started the smart-ass style copied by ESPN anchors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if this is going to work,'' said Robertson. ``In
the '70s, there were only two other choices and `Monday Night
Football' was more of a variety show with football in the
background. Nowadays there are hundreds of other options for people
who don't watch sports. Maybe Miller can stem the flow. He is
enough of a loose-cannon and unpredictable character that viewers
might tune in just to see what he says. But I'm worried that the
television audience will continue to leave regardless of who is in
the booth. Hiring a comedian was a great stunt for the old
networks. It's not for the modern-day cable universe.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller, 47, is undaunted. Known for his caustic wit on ``Dennis
Miller Live'' on HBO -- ``I don't want to get off on a rant'' or
``Of course, that's just my opinion, I could be wrong'' -- Miller
readily concedes that he was a ``quirky hire.'' He also explained
that he knows what it's like to follow in the footsteps of a
legend. Miller came after Chevy Chase as the weekend anchor on
``Saturday Night Live.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't Chevy Chase and I'm not going to be Howard Cosell,''
Miller said. ``I don't know football broadcasting, but I know how
to work in front of a camera and I will (work hard) coming up with
lots of information. I'll do the best I can, but I can only be me.
I can't change.''

 &HT;    Jones takes big leap in drive for 5
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   EUGENE, Ore. _ Aspiring to be an Olympic diva has some
non-negotiable requirements. You've got to package your celebrity
by publishing a book, be cast in a catchy ad campaign for Nike and,
most important, separate yourself from the pack.
</P>
<P>
   Have a dream, girl.
</P>
<P>
   Marion Jones has it all working. The star of Nike's ``Me &AMP; Mrs.
Jones'' commercials just released a book, ``See How She Runs,'' and
has an unprecedented Olympic appetite. She is staking out five gold
medals, which beats the heck out of what Michael Johnson brought to
the Atlanta Games and is something never before attempted
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   If everything goes according to script in Sydney, you can bet on
NBC selling the striking 24-year-old as the greatest female athlete
in the universe.
</P>
<P>
   That she can rush to gold in the 100 and 200 meters is a solid
possibility. It gets a little dicey in the 400 and 1,600-meter
relays, with the risk of a dropped baton and the reliance on
others. But her Sydney dream could hit the pits in the long jump,
where Mrs. Jones _ actually married to world champion shot-putter
C.J. Hunter _ is, at best, a work in progress.
</P>
<P>
   Jones takes another pre-Olympic Trials crack today at the long
jump in the Prefontaine Classic Grand Prix, where she also will
display her 100-meter speed.
</P>
<P>
   It is a hectic weekend for the sport, with top Americans and a
handful of elite foreigners competing at either the Nike-sponsored
Prefontaine or the rival Adidas Oregon Track Classic on Sunday in
Portland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a doubt, the long jump is going to be the most
challenging,'' acknowledged Jones, expected to be the breakout star
of the Sydney Games. ``I never said going after the five events
would be an easy task. I've always proceeded along this whole road
knowing that it would be quite difficult, but I'm up for the
challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   And the chore.
</P>
<P>
   When healthy, no one in the world can touch her in the sprints.
Jones has been ranked No. 1 in the world by Track &AMP; Field News in
both the 100 and 200 each of the last three years. She also opened
this season with a 49.59 seconds clocking in the 400,
fourth-fastest time by an American ever.
</P>
<P>
   Since the spring of 1997, Jones has run 57 finals in the 100 and
200-meter sprints and has won all but four. Only the late Florence
Griffith Joyner ever has run faster.
</P>
<P>
   But Jones has yet to beat anyone in an Olympic spotlight, and
two-time gold medalist Gail Devers and the talented Inger Miller
lurk in the 100.
</P>
<P>
   As a high school senior, Jones qualified as an alternate on the
400-meter relay team for the 1992 Barcelona Games, but she passed
to play basketball at North Carolina. In 1996, injuries kept her
away from the trials.
</P>
<P>
   At last summer's World Championships, billed as a dress
rehearsal for the Games, she promised to win four events. In the
end, she won only the 100. She placed third in the long jump and
headed home after pulling up lame with back spasms in the 200
semis.
</P>
<P>
   It has been suggested that the physical strain of the long jump
caught up with her, but Jones will hear nothing of it. ``The
problems had nothing to do with the long jump,''' she said. ``I
felt perfectly fine.''
</P>
<P>
   But the long jump is her weak event. Three-time Olympic champion
Jackie Joyner-Kersee, 38, is weighing whether to leap out of
retirement next month for the trials. Spaniard Niurka Montalvo and
Fiona May of Italy cast are considerd the top gold-medal contenders
in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Jones began the season suffering her worst performance of the
past three years in the Osaka Grand Prix, where she placed fourth
with a best of 20-7. Last weekend, she went a modest 21-6 and was
upset by training partner Chandra Sturrup in a meet in Raleigh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime I decide to jump, the pressure is going to be there,
simply because I've had some problems in the past,'' Jones said.
``We sat down long and hard after Osaka, and I wasn't very
comfortbale with the new style we were using. So we went back to
what worked in `98. Although people criticized in 98, it wasn't
nearly as much as people are criticizing now.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones scrapped plans to turn herself into a power jumper who
explodes into the air off the board. Instead, she is returning to
her basic form of sprinting off the takeover board in an almost
flat arc over the sand. Her technique isn't pretty, but it produced
a jump of nearly 24 feet two seasons ago.
</P>
<P>
   With her heavy workload, it figures to be important for Jones to
pop a good early jump in the trials and Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the goal, always,'' she said. ``Historically for me,
it has taken four, five, six jumps. So I'm quite used to that. I'm
a competitor, and if somebody like a Fiona May or Heike Drechsler
is behind me, I'm not going to pass knowing they have the
capability of jumping 23 feet at any moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``At 24 years old, if I can't take six jumps in a competition,
then what is going to happen when I'm 28 or 29? I might as well do
it now.''

ISLANDERS SETTING SIGHTS ON DIPIETRO? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALGARY, Alberta _ When you think about teenagers lobbying
parents for something, it's usually for a later curfew, borrowing
the car on a Saturday night, or pushing for Internet time.
</P>
<P>
   The requests usually aren't to move more than 600 miles from
home after your sophomore year of high school or bidding farewell
to college after your freshman year.
</P>
<P>
   But Rick DiPietro campaigned for both of those things, convinced
his parents he was right, and Saturday at the Saddledome, he is in
a position to be the highest American-born goaltender selected in
the National Hockey League draft since Tom Barrasso in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Barrasso was picked fifth by Buffalo and went right to the the
Sabres' lineup out of Acton-Boxborough (Mass.) High School. Word
around the rink was that the New York Islanders, who have the No. 1
pick, were gearing up to not only select DiPietro, but to have a
contract in place before stepping to the podium.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders, who have been handcuffed by financial
restrictions the last few years, are expected to increase their
payroll significantly this season. The other part of the equation
revolving around DiPietro is whether the Islanders can reach a deal
for their current goalie of the future _ Roberto Luongo, whom the
Islanders took fourth overall in 1997. If they can get a
significant return for him, it's likely DiPietro would go first.
</P>
<P>
   DiPietro, whose family resides in Winthrop, Mass., is the
top-ranked North American goalie after a sensational showing at the
World Junior Tournament and an outstanding freshman season at
Boston University.
</P>
<P>
   The road here, though, was paved through Ann Arbor, Mich., first
and Boston's Commonwealth Avenue second _ the first destination
DiPietro had to fight for and the second he elected to walk away
from.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After a year at St. Sebastian's, where DiPietro and current
Boston College goalie Tim Kelleher sat on the bench watching Mike
Morrison (now at the University of Maine) stop pucks, DiPietro put
together a sales pitch and went about lobbying his parents to allow
him to go to Ann Arbor to play in the Team USA Development Program,
which, at the time, was headed by former Lake Superior State coach
Jeff Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   DiPietro's argument was the glut of goalies at St. Sebastian's
and the fact that his progress was being hindered. DiPietro yearned
for a more substantial opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hated it, he hated it,'' said DiPietro's father, Rick,
about his son's season at St. Sebastian's. ``He wanted to play.
When he was playing in the Metropolitan Boston League, the goal was
to get into an independent school like St. Sebastian's or Belmont
Hill and then become a starting goaltender. It was very frustrating
for him to have to sit on the bench. We had always wanted him to go
to an independent school and never board. We wanted him to be at
home right through high school. When he said he wanted to go to Ann
Arbor it was a tough decision for us, especially for his mother.''
</P>
<P>
   DiPietro, who is represented by Boston-based Woolf Associates,
flourished in the program and continued to excel at BU. In the
World Junior tournament in Sweden in December and January, DiPietro
became just the second American in the competition's 23-year
history to earn the Directorate Award as the tourney's outstanding
goalie. Last spring, he set an NCAA tournament record with 77 saves
in BU's 3-2 quadruple-overtime loss to St. Lawrence in the NCAA
quarterfinals, the longest game in tournament history.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When the May 1 deadline for opting into the NHL draft loomed,
DiPietro sat his parents down again. His folks wanted him to stay
in school. The 18-year-old wanted out. This time, he was armed with
an even better salesman's pitch, a lawyerlike determination, and a
steely resolve. As Rick and Cheryl DiPietro had learned two years
before, saying no to this kid wasn't possible, especially when they
came to believe he was right.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the selling job he had to do, DiPietro laughed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's always the case with parents, I think,'' said DiPietro,
who seems poised beyond his years. ``You've got to try to sell them
on something that you want. Going to Ann Arbor and opting into the
draft were two things I really felt strongly about. They were
pretty good about realizing what I wanted. It took a little
convincing, but as soon as I did, they jumped on board and were
really supportive. I just sat down with them and told them how I
felt and brought up some points I felt were important when I was
making the decision and they began to see where I was coming from.
It took a while but they finally came around.''
</P>
<P>
   When the lobbying first began _ it coincided with the euphoria
over his World Junior performance _ DiPietro's father quickly
dismissed talk of the draft. There were college games to play,
classes to attend, and May 1 was a long way off.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew it was something he didn't need to think about until
May so the discussion only lasted for a few seconds,'' said the
elder DiPietro, who works in property management. ``It was a matter
of `Listen, you need to play well because if you don't play well,
opting in isn't even going to be a consideration. So just go focus
on playing college hockey.' For Rick, the discussion wasn't long
enough and the answer wasn't good enough.''
</P>
<P>
   When the end of April rolled around, the goalie put on his best
full-court press and his parents had no choice but to see things
his way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably the last three or two days, he convinced his mother
and myself that it was the right thing to do,'' said the elder
Rick. ``He probably, at the very end, wavered more than we did. We
were at a place where, `This is what he is going to do,' and we
were going to support him. If he decided not to go and stay in
college, that was terrific. If he was going to opt in, then we were
going to support him 100 percent of the way. He convinced us that
this was something that meant an awful lot to him, this was his
dream. His feeling was, `You've got to let me do it, I know I can
do it.' We believe in him and we believe in him enough through his
18 years that when he's committed to something and he does his best
at something, he's generally going to succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   That isn't to say the young man doesn't listen to anything other
than his inner voice. Quite the contrary. He has a very cocky style
on the ice, but he's very articulate and thoughtful off the ice. He
said he solicited all kinds of opinions. He talked to Colorado
Avalanche forward and former Terrier Chris Drury, BU coach Jack
Parker, and myriad others. He said the best advice came from
Bruins' goaltender John Grahame, who spent three years at Lake
Superior State before turning pro.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said it was his dream (to make the NHL) and that college
was a steppingstone to the next level, and if the time felt right
then it was your opportunity to make that step, that you should try
to do it,'' said DiPietro. ``I thought that was great advice
because I came to college looking for it to be a steppingstone to
the NHL.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He has spent the last little while undergoing physical and
psychological testing and extensive interviews by prospective
suitors. It's been a grueling process but DiPietro, who is known
for his superior puck-handling skills, believes deep in his heart
that he can be a successful NHL goalie. It's what he's worked for,
what he's planned for, and definitely what he has lobbied his
parents for.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I commit myself to something, I work my hardest to
achieve it,'' he said. ``I feel like this being my dream and
everything and putting my full effort into to it, I'll keep
progressing to the point where I can be an impact player in the
NHL.''
</P>
<P>
   Until later Saturday, when the big announcement comes, it'll be
a waiting game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been kind of an anxious time, to tell you the truth,'' he
said. ``I'm just hoping this thing works its way out and everything
goes as planned. It seems like days are dragging on until
(Saturday) but it's been a lot of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   One could argue that it's been even more stressful on mom and
dad. At least, though, the lobbying is over. Their son is about to
get what he wants _ again. Given his track record, no one doubts
it's just the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``As parents, we're sort of just along for the ride,'' said dad.
``Now we're all along for the ride.''
</P>
<P>
   And the next destination is in sight.

ANIMALS HAVE TAKEN OVER ART,   AND ART WONDERS WHY

<P>
   Why have real animals _ clothed, splattered, slaughtered and
hatching _ become players in the art world? These days it seems
that every contemporary art exhibition must have its animal, dead
or alive.
</P>
<P>
   At the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art in North Adams,
the centerpiece of an exhibition called ``Unnatural Science'' is
``Misfit (St. Bernhard)'' by Thomas Gruenfeld. It is the head of a
sheep seamlessly attached to the body of a dog. Get it? Sheepdog.
</P>
<P>
   For the Whitney Biennial this year, Yukinori Yanagi, a
Japanese-born conceptual artist, created two pieces with the help
of some ants. For one, Yanagi assembled a replica of Jasper Johns'
``Three Flags'' by pouring red, white and blue sand into three
Plexiglass boxes. Then he poured in live ants, inviting them to
tunnel through the sand. As the ant farm got busy, the flag began
to collapse.
</P>
<P>
   In February at the Trapholt Art Museum in Denmark, Marco
Evaristti displayed 10 goldfish, each swimming in its own blender,
and viewers were allowed, if they wanted, to turn on a blender and
frappe a fish. ``Two fish were blended at the opening,'' The
Associated Press reported, ``and police ordered the blenders' plugs
pulled after a local group, the Union for the Protection of
Animals, complained.'' The museum's director, Peter Meyer, said
five more fish were blended on the weekend after the opening.
</P>
<P>
   Of course there is Animal himself, Damien Hirst. At the
``Sensation'' show in London and Brooklyn, Hirst presented numerous
animal corpses, including: a shark in formaldehyde (``The Physical
Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living,'' 1991); a
whole cow cross-sectioned and fitted into plexiglass cases (``Some
Comfort Gained From the Acceptance of the Inherent Lies in
Everything,'' 1996); a pig on a rail, sliced the long way so
viewers could see the insides from snout to tail (``This Little
Piggy Went to Market, This Little Piggy Stayed at Home,'' 1996).
</P>
<P>
   The use of live and dead animals in art has a history, and the
history begins in Surrealism. Go back to 1938, when Salvador Dali
made ``Rainy Taxi'' for the lobby of the International Exposition
of Surrealism at the Galerie Beaux-Arts. Inside the car were two
mannequins, one covered with live snails from Burgundy that fed on
nearby lettuce and vines watered by rain falling from the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years later, larger fauna came into the picture. There
was Robert Rauschenberg's angora goat encircled by a tire
(``Monogram,'' 1955-59). Hermann Nitsch disemboweled and tore apart
a dead lamb in Germany in 1962 (``The Orgies Mysteries Theater'').
</P>
<P>
   In Germany in 1965, Joseph Beuys lectured earnestly to a dead
hare (``How to Explain Pictures to a Dead Hare''). A decade later
he came to America and caged himself for a week with a live coyote
(``Coyote: I Like America and America Likes Me,'' 1974). In 1969,
Jannis Kounellis tethered 12 live horses to the wall of a gallery
in Rome (``Horses''). A few years later, Annette Messager was
outfitting dead sparrows with small wool sweaters _ pink, yellow
and blue _ that she had knitted herself (``Boarders at Rest,''
1972).
</P>
<P>
   What does it all mean?
</P>
<P>
   Well, there are some things you can say. Artists have favored
certain animals _ lambs, horses, dogs, bunnies, birds and insects.
They have tended to give their animal works fancy titles, with the
same themes cropping up again and again _ sacrifice, sex, death,
control, possession, abjection. Still, it is impossible to
generalize. The explanations that artists, critics and curators
provide are as numerous as the works of art.
</P>
<P>
   Start with Rauschenberg's goat in the tire. The critic Robert
Hughes, who nicknamed it ``The Satyr in the Sphincter,'' thought it
was an emblem of nature caught in culture's web and also an
insignia of homosexuality: the priapic animal, he observed, had
pushed its way into a giant orifice. The critic Arthur Danto saw
the goat as a sacrificial animal ``wreathed with laurel when led to
the altar.'' Leo Steinberg, in ``Encounters With Rauschenberg,''
called it Rauschenberg's act of possession: ``As the artist would
encircle a car key with paint, and a bicycle with neon tubing, so
here,'' Steinberg wrote, he circled the goat and ``made it
private.''
</P>
<P>
   Beuys and his dead bunnies and live coyote have also provoked
talk, particularly from Beuys himself. After he performed ``The
Chief,'' a work in which he rolled himself in a blanket that was
plugged up at each end with a dead hare, Beuys was asked whether he
considered himself ``the chief of the animals.'' He responded,
``Yes, I speak for the hares that cannot speak for themselves.''
Then he added, ``I would like to elevate the status of animals to
that of humans.''
</P>
<P>
   Nitsch said that his mutilation of a dead lamb was a way of
taking ``upon myself the apparently negative, unsavory, perverse,
obscene, the passion and the hysteria of the act of sacrifice so
that YOU ARE spared the sullying, shaming descent into the
extreme.''
</P>
<P>
   Less grandiosely, the philosopher Peter Singer said the presence
of animals in some art seemed intended to drive home an injustice:
``We know that animals are close to us, evolutionarily,
genetically. But we still haven't changed the way in which we use
them for food or research.'' Take the fish in blenders. ``When you
give people the option of turning the blender on,'' Singer said,
``you raise the question of the power we do have over animals.''
</P>
<P>
   Others see irony. Steve Baker, a lecturer in historical and
critical studies at the University of Central Lancashire in
England, argues that many of these artists seem bent on creating a
``postmodern animal,'' to show that animals are to some degree
human constructions.
</P>
<P>
   These new pastiche creatures ``may or may not incorporate living
animals,'' he writes in ``The Postmodern Animal.'' In any case, it
doesn't quite matter, because living animals these days ``are
arguably being `made' in the factory farm and in the scientists'
laboratory just as much as in the poststructuralist philosopher's
text or the postmodern artist's studio.''
</P>
<P>
   With Dolly, the cloned sheep, the time of the postmodern animal
may have arrived in science. If that is the case, artists are
prepared. Baker considers Rauschenberg's goat in a tire,
Gruenfeld's mismatched taxidermy and William Wegman's dog dressed
up as a bug-eyed, flippered frog (``Frog/Frog II,'' 1982) to be
``botched'' animals. Botching, he notes, is not all bad. It is a
creative procedure. It is ``reverse butchery.''
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the final word on animal art belongs to Robert
Storr, a senior curator at the Museum of Modern Art, who suggests
that the use of animals has followed a general ``shift to
literalism.''
</P>
<P>
   By the 1960s a painting was just paint and canvas. Sculpture
went the same way. A steel box was a steel box. A stone was a
stone. There was a leaning toward ``quiddity,'' he said, toward the
``itness'' of material. So what does that mean for animals in art?
An animal, Storr says, is ``not a style, a movement, a tendency.''
An animal is definitely not a new medium.
</P>
<P>
   Even in a museum, sometimes an animal is just an animal.

WHERE THE COMPLEXITY OF CULTURES MEETS NATURE'S SIMPLICITY 
</HEADLINE>
   By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In his most famous essay, written almost 30 years ago, the
anthropologist Clifford Geertz dissected the ritual of a Balinese
cockfight. In preparation for the fight, men would groom choice
roosters, nurture them and coddle them. A villager would
suggestively sit with a bird between his thighs, ``bouncing it
gently up and down to strengthen its legs.''
</P>
<P>
   When the time came, a master craftsman would fit the bird's legs
with razor-sharp spurs and send it into a 50-foot square ring, to
slash another similarly equipped cock, while village men bet on
which bird would slaughter the other. The owner of the winner would
eat the loser.
</P>
<P>
   The sexual symbolism is far from subtle _ the Balinese word for
cock means hero, warrior, lady killer, tough guy _ but there is
more going on here. Geertz meticulously described the frenzied
betting on the fight, how ``Balinese status hierarchy'' is
reproduced in the battle and the way in which the Balinese
revulsion at animal-like behavior (babies are not even permitted to
crawl) is countered by this animalistic extravaganza. In a
cockfight, he suggested, the Balinese display their culture.
</P>
<P>
   The only way for a foreigner to understand that culture is to
become immersed in its detail. This essay (in his classic
collection, ``The Interpretation of Cultures'') was a demonstration
of his anthropological philosophy: We come to understand another
social universe through ``thick description.''
</P>
<P>
   The point is not to discover unchanging universal principles but
to unmask the particular. The Western anthropologist is a peculiar
guest in an alien world, observing a performance while affecting
the world he observes.
</P>
<P>
   Geertz's most recent collection of papers and lectures, written
over the last two decades, makes the peculiarities of his
profession still more pronounced.
</P>
<P>
   What, he asks, is anthropology really about?
</P>
<P>
   What is to be made of Nayar matrilineal society, Aztec sacrifice
and Hopi forms of speech, let alone cockfights?
</P>
<P>
   Isn't the anthropologist doomed to misinterpret another culture?
Is any universal judgment possible?
</P>
<P>
   Anthropologists, Geertz writes, are ``merchants of
astonishment,'' who constantly undermine any generalizations.
</P>
<P>
   So the anthropologist stands at a troubled crossroads _ a place
where, it turns out, many contemporary political battles also play
themselves out. In one direction is the world of culture, diverse
and unimaginably complex. In the other is the world of nature,
immutable and universal. Though Geertz has now spent many years on
the faculty at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, his
career has been spent following one path while trying to hold the
other in view.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with his allegiance to the world of culture, where
absolutes do not apply, Geertz quotes Montaigne: ``Each man calls
barbarism whatever is not his practice.'' His idea of ``thick
description'' does not only describe anthropology's possibilities,
it also limits those possibilities. Anthropology is particular,
never more.
</P>
<P>
   The path he does not take leads to a very different world, where
universals are possible, where there is such a thing as human
nature and where there may even be moral standards that allow one
culture to judge another _ to condemn, say, human sacrifice or
ritual clitorodectomies.
</P>
<P>
   The central essays of this book attack such positions. Some
anthropologists, Geertz suggests, place ``morality beyond culture
and knowledge beyond both.'' But he argues that there is absolutely
no evidence supporting universalism. In one piece, ``The State of
the Art,'' Geertz declares: ``Any sentence that begins, `All
societies have,' is either baseless or banal.'' In another, ``Anti
Anti-Relativism,'' based on a 1985 lecture, Geertz turns sarcastic
and fiercely polemical, hinting that universalistic declarations
easily lead to absolutist condemnations like ``the poor are
worthless'' or ``blacks are subhuman.''
</P>
<P>
   But Geertz exaggerates the positions of his opponents to score
points. Just because bad judgments about morality are possible
doesn't mean judgments about morality are impossible. Sometimes he
seems to recognize this. He calls his lecture ``Anti
Anti-Relativism'' because while he tends to support relativism, he
is not fully comfortable with postmodern relativism, in which
almost no judgments are valid and even anthropology begins to seem
an impossible undertaking.
</P>
<P>
   Geertz's quasi-relativism, though, leads to other problems. He
describes a cultural dilemma: An American Indian is waiting for a
dialysis machine, but the white middle-class doctors don't want to
put him high on the list because he is an alcoholic. The Indian
asserts his people's troubled past and his right to drink; the
doctors assert their right to set social priorities. What is to be
done?
</P>
<P>
   The relativist would say there is no way to judge between the
two claims. But Geertz urges a kind of mutual understanding. ``If
we wish to be able capaciously to judge, as of course we must, we
need to make ourselves able capaciously to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet eventually the judgment must be made, and isn't that an
assertion of standards favoring one right over another? In fact, in
the midst of Geertz's thick descriptions, all sorts of assumptions
are made about the anthropologist's ability to render objective
judgments.
</P>
<P>
   One result is an uneasy ambivalence. Geertz wants to resist the
clutches of either party, but this doesn't necessarily make him
right, only representative of his profession. For the troubled
crossroads marks precisely the place where anthropology was born,
and where it still dwells.
</P>
<P>
   Anthropology is a distinctly Western enterprise. As far as I
know, no other culture has ever undertaken a systematic
understanding of the world's various societies. It was an
enterprise that arose partly out of a notion of universal law _
finding principles that would apply across all times and all
cultures.
</P>
<P>
   If all human life shares certain principles, then it becomes
difficult for any one society to assert claims of innate
superiority. Western universalism gives birth to Western
relativism. So anthropologists have ended up thrashing about
between the worlds of universalism and relativism. The rest of us
stand on the sidelines, frenziedly betting.

GORE IS STILL RAISING FUNDS AS INQUIRY CONTINUES 
</HEADLINE>
   By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE with JAMES DAO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Within hours of ordering his lawyers to release the
transcript of his interview during the investigation into his 1996
fund-raising activities, Vice President Al Gore was back to
business as usual on Friday _ trolling for money.
</P>
<P>
   In an affluent Silicon Valley neighborhood, Gore raised $500,000
over lunch. In Denver on Thursday, Gore headlined two events that
raised a total of $1.1 million. On Friday, after the Silicon Valley
lunch, he attended a gala dinner on the San Francisco waterfront
where the singers David Crosby and Steven Stills serenaded several
hundred people.
</P>
<P>
   Then came a reception at a private home. The day's total take:
$2 million. On Saturday he was scheduled to attend a fund-raiser in
Miami that was expected to bring his three-day total to over $3.5
million.
</P>
<P>
   The fund-raising events were broken up by the news on Thursday
that, based on an April 18 deposition of Gore, a Justice Department
official was asking Attorney General Janet Reno for an
investigation into the vice president's money-raising activities in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night Gore advisers read the transcripts of the
deposition and on Friday they released copies to news
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns about Gore's overzealous money-raising, coming in the
midst of a fund-raising swing, put an especially fine point on what
Gore likes to call the ``irony'' of his situation.
</P>
<P>
   Here is how Gore _ who has tried to deflect criticism of his
links to the fund-raising problems by calling himself ``an
imperfect messenger'' for overhauling the campaign finance system _
dealt with this uncomfortable topic at lunch on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In a sun-splashed dining room, where paintings by Miro and
Chagall decorated the stucco walls, he talked confidently about the
nation's powerhouse economy, borrowing a line from Ronald Reagan:
Did Americans feel they were better off today than they were eight
years ago?
</P>
<P>
   There was a soft murmur of assent. And then, perhaps in a nod to
the issue that had dominated Friday's news reports, Gore briefly
made a pitch for tossing out the entire campaign finance system
that has caused him so much grief.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an irony to talk about this issue at a fund-raising
event, I realize,'' Gore told the dozen or so people who had paid
$25,000 each to lunch on grilled salmon and vegetables. ``But the
first bill I will present to Congress will be the McCain-Feingold
campaign finance bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has struggled mightily over the last two weeks to focus
attention on the upside of the Clinton administration _ the
unprecedented economic expansion and his ideas for using the
nation's growing budget surplus to improve education, health care
and the environment. This forms the basis of his ``prosperity and
progress tour'' and the underpinning of his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   But he is being pulled away from sketching out a rosy future to
explaining the past. And in doing so, he is being pulled inexorably
into the downside of the administration _ not just the questionable
fund raising of 1996 but the specter of the next president spending
his time being questioned under oath about whether he has told the
truth.
</P>
<P>
   For the last year, Gore has been working furiously to separate
himself from an administration that has been accused repeatedly of
not telling the truth, even as his opponent, Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas, has offered himself as an alternative. And Bush clearly
hoped that the call for an investigation into Gore's truthfulness
would signal to voters that a Gore administration would not be much
different from Bill Clinton's.
</P>
<P>
   ``If America is tired of scandals and investigations, let's
elect somebody different, other than the people of the Clinton/Gore
administration,'' Bush said in Alabama on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the Gore campaign was employing a durable Clinton
tactic made familiar during the Monica Lewinsky investigation _
pre-emptively releasing hundreds of pages of documents in an effort
to defuse the controversy and dispatch it quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and his advisers moved in an uncharacteristically
aggressive fashion to dispel any suggestion of wrongdoing and,
using another Clinton tactic, implied that the re-emergence of the
issue was, if not a vast right-wing conspiracy, at least an
orchestrated smear by the Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president hinted broadly that Thursday's leak of the
request for an investigation was politically motivated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the timing of this whole thing speaks for itself,''
Gore told reporters as he announced that his campaign was releasing
the transcripts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have told the truth,'' he added. ``I have cooperated fully.
And I don't want people to have the impression that I am trying to
hide something. I am not. I want you to see it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Fabiani, a spokesman for Gore and a veteran of the Clinton
White House damage-control operation, said that the release of
documents was the best way for the Gore campaign to fight what he
described as ``Republican dirty tricks.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Fabiani said that the Republicans, through Sen. Arlen Specter,
R-Pa., had leaked the information because ``Bush was having a bad
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Fabiani noted that the governor had been presiding over an
execution and pointed to reports that Bush's financial ties to the
oil industry would render him useless in the battle against high
gas prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the Republicans tried to do yesterday was to kick up dust
and say, `No one really knows what the issue is, but it's an issue,
it's significant and it comes out of this April 18 deposition,'''
Fabiani said. ``Those of us who read through the deposition last
night couldn't find a single such issue that was compelling, and
the quickest way to challenge that was to release it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rachel Gorlin, a Democratic consultant, said the Gore campaign
was probably smart to release the transcripts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Clinton lesson is to show that it's worth it to engage in
the discussion, partly because the public doesn't care that much
and partly because this gives Gore standing'' to make his case and
challenge the Republicans, Gorlin said. ``The thinking is, let's
take the hit now and move on, that they won't find anything they
can use in the fall, and by then it will be old news anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   She also said that the possible investigation illustrated the
age-old problem for vice presidents seeking to become president:
``Is this election about what's gone on during the previous
administration or is it about what he can do in the future?''
</P>
<P>
   Allies of Gore saw another possible advantage in releasing the
transcripts. Although Gore uses the word ``hell,'' apparently
reinforcing reports that he was angry and confrontational during
the deposition, Fabiani suggested that this showed passion, a
quality that he has been accused of lacking.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for the Bush campaign and for Specter said that there
was no collusion between them.

TEXAS MURDER CASE MAY PUT DEATH PENALTY SPOTLIGHT ON CLINTON

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the nation's attention drawn to recent
executions, the focus has been largely on the states, primarily
Illinois, whose governor has declared a moratorium, and Texas,
which puts more men and women to death than most countries and
whose governor, of course, is running for president.
</P>
<P>
   Although Vice President Al Gore favors the death penalty, he has
not faced the tough questioning that Gov. George W. Bush has, and
Gore has said little other than that he does not see the need for a
federal moratorium.
</P>
<P>
   But the case of a condemned migrant worker may soon call
attention to the federal capital punishment system.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Raul Garza, a migrant farm worker and high school dropout
who was convicted seven years ago of marijuana smuggling and three
drug-related murders in Brownsville, Texas, is scheduled to be
executed on Aug. 5. It would be the first federal execution since
John F. Kennedy was president.
</P>
<P>
   The Garza case raises broad, and for many, troubling issues
about the application of the federal death penalty, most
specifically, whether race and geography determine who is sentenced
to die at the hands of the U.S. government. Seventeen of the 21
federal death row inmates are minorities, and federal prosecutors
in a dozen Southern states account for more than half of the
federal cases in which the death penalty is sought.
</P>
<P>
   Garza's lawyers have exhausted legal appeals, and are turning to
the court of public opinion and politics.
</P>
<P>
   Garza wants to ask the president for clemency. But his lawyers
said they are facing some formidable handicaps.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Constitution gives presidents absolute authority to

time, they rarely do.

cases is  &UR; &AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP; &LR;  clear, the procedures in capital
cases are still being drafted, Clinton said in February.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of clear guidelines, Garza's lawyers believe,
severe- ly hampers their ability to make an effective case for
clemency.

   WASHINGTON _ With the nation's attention drawn to recent
executions, the focus has been largely on the states, primarily
Illinois, whose governor has declared a moratorium, and Texas,
which puts more men and women to death than most countries and
whose governor, of course, is running for president.
</P>
<P>
   This has allowed the Clinton administration to remain largely
above the fray because there has not been a federal execution in
nearly 40 years. Although Vice President Al Gore favors the death
penalty, he has not faced the tough questioning that Gov. George W.
Bush has, and Gore has said little other than that he does not see
the need for a federal moratorium.
</P>
<P>
   But the case of a condemned migrant worker may soon call
attention to the federal capital punishment system.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Raul Garza, a migrant farm worker and high school dropout
who was convicted seven years ago of marijuana smuggling and three
drug-related murders in Brownsville, Texas, is scheduled to be
executed on Aug. 5. It would be the first federal execution since
John F. Kennedy was president, when a man was put to death by
hanging in Iowa, for kidnapping and murder.
</P>
<P>
   The Garza case raises broad, and for many, troubling issues
about the application of the federal death penalty, most
specifically, whether race and geography determine who is sentenced
to die at the hands of the U.S. government. Seventeen of the 21
federal death row inmates are minorities, and federal prosecutors
in a dozen Southern states account for more than half of the
federal cases in which the death penalty is sought.
</P>
<P>
   Garza's lawyers have exhausted legal appeals, and are turning to
the court of public opinion and politics. They have enlisted the
American Bar Association, which in a highly unusual move last
month, called on President Clinton to declare a moratorium on
federal executions.
</P>
<P>
   Garza wants to ask the president for clemency. But his lawyers
said they are facing some formidable handicaps.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Constitution gives presidents absolute authority to
L grant clemency and presidents could do so on their own at any
time, they rarely do.
</P>
<P>
   And while the procedure for seek- ing clemency in noncapital
cases is  &UR; &AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP; &LR;  clear, the procedures in capital
cases are still being drafted, Clinton said in February.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of clear guidelines, Garza's lawyers believe,
severe- ly hampers their ability to make an effective case for
clemency. ``We're really between a rock and a hard place,'' said
Gregory Wiercioch, a lawyer with the Texas Defender Service, who
has been representing Garza in his appeals. ``A lot of the
information we want to put in the petition, we don't have. It's in
the hands of the government.''
</P>
<P>
   This includes a study on whether race is a factor in applying
the death penalty in federal cases. The Justice Department has
turned down Garza's request for the study or the raw data that the
department has gathered. A department spokesman said the study has
not been completed and the data would not be made public.
</P>
<P>
   Garza's lawyers have also requested information on how the the
Justice Department has handled other capital cases. There are a
dozen cases like Garza's _ multiple drug-related murders _ in which
federal prosecutors did not seek the death penalty, including six
in New York, Wiercioch said. He wants to know why the death penalty
was sought in Garza's case and believes that race was a factor. Of
the 27 defendants against whom the Bush administration sought the
death penalty for drug-related killings, including Garza, who was
convicted after Bush left office, 23 were African-American or
Hispanic, Wiercioch said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, when Congress was considering sweeping death penalty
legislation, Attorney General Janet Reno said in a letter to a
congressman who opposed the death penalty that the department was
developing procedures that would allow for the disclosure of its
capital prosecution decisions ``so that the public can review and
understand the basis for such decisions.'' A Justice Department
official said this week that the procedures have not yet been
adopted.
</P>
<P>
   After the Supreme Court declared in 1972 that the death penalty,
as it was then being applied, was unconstitutional, states quickly
adopted laws that the court upheld. But Congress spent the next 16
years struggling to find a way around the court's concerns. In
1988, Congress adopted what has become known as the ``drug kingpin
statute,'' which allows for the death penalty against an individual
who commits murder as part of a larger drug enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Six years later, in 1994, Congress enacted the Federal Death
Penalty Act, which expanded the crimes for which a defendant could
be executed. They include the assassination of the president,
large-scale drug trafficking even when no one is killed, drive-by
killings, sexual abuse resulting in death and destruction of a
plane, train or motor vehicle resulting in death.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law requires the appointment of two lawyers for an
indigent defendant facing the death penalty, at least one of whom
must be experienced in capital cases. As a result, claims of
ineffective assistance of counsel do not mark the federal system,
as they do many states, such as Texas, where defendants have been
represented by lawyers who have slept through trials, or have

   The principal concerns about the federal death penalty are
whether it is being applied fairly and uniformly.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Since 1988, the Justice Department has allowed the death penalty
to be sought against 199 defendants, according to the Federal Death
Penalty Resource Counsel in Columbia, S.C. Seventy-six percent of
those defendants are minorities, and 52 percent are
African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 21 federal inmates currently on death row _ including
Timothy McVeigh, who was convicted in the Oklahoma City bombings _
about 62 percent, or 13 are African-Americans. This is a greater
percentage of blacks on death row than in all but four states:
Maryland, Louisiana, Illinois and Pennsylvania. In Texas, by
contrast, 41 percent of the death row population is black, and in
Alabama, 46 percent, according to the Death Penalty Information
Center, a private organization in Washington that opposes the death
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``If some back county in the South had the same kind of numbers,
the Department of Justice would be down here investigating, handing
out indictments,'' Wiercioch said.

<P>
   In an interview last week, Gore said, ``The question of racial
disparity is right now being investigated thoroughly within the
Justice Department.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that the factors that led Columbia University
researchers to raise questions about the death penalty in a recent
study, such as prosecutorial misconduct and incompetent defense
counsel ``are the kinds of mistakes that could conceivably have a
connection to racial attitudes in the aggregate.''
</P>
<P>
   In his letter to Clinton on May 2 calling for a federal
moratorium, the president of the American Bar Association, William
G. Paul of Oklahoma City, urged a ``comprehensive examination of
the federal death penalty that would not be limited to the question
of racial discrimination.'' The bar association has not taken a
position for or against the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   There are glaring geographic disparities in the application of
the federal death penalty law.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen of the 21 defendants on federal death row, in Terre
Haute, Ind., are from three states _ Texas, six; Virginia, four;
and Missouri, four.
</P>
<P>
   Under a system put in place by Reno, U.S. attorneys who file
charges in which the death penalty is a possibility are required to
send a memorandum to the Justice Department for review by a
four-member committee, the Capital Case Review Committee. The
system is intended to ensure uniformity and fairness in the
application of the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, from 1994 to 1999, one-third of the U.S. attorney's offices
did not file a capital prosecution request, a former member of the
review committee, Rory K. Little, wrote in an article in the
Fordham Urban Law Journal in March 1999.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Little noted that federal prosecutors have considerable
discretion but he said this suggested that the federal death
penalty was not being applied uniformly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is difficult to believe that not a single murder in those
11 states since 1994 was a possible candidate for federal
prosecution,'' Little wrote in the article, ``The Federal Death
Penalty: History and Some Thoughts About the Department of
Justice's Role.'' He went on: ``There are, sadly, gang-related
killings in every urban center in America and drug-related killings
occur not only in Miami, but also in urban centers such as New
York, San Francisco, Chicago and Seattle.''
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Little, a former federal prosecutor
who is now a professor of criminal law and legal ethics at Hastings
College of Law in San Francisco, said he was not an ``emotional
opponent'' of the death penalty, but that he had ``grave
misgivings'' about the way it is administered by the states.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; On the federal level, he said, further study was needed before
a judgment could be made. He added: ``In my view, it isn't fair
that if somebody who commits a bank robbery and a guard dies is
going to get the death penalty if it happened in Texas, but someone
who does the same thing in Massachusetts isn't.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   He said he was aware of a case in Missouri that was very similar
to Garza's in which the government did not seek the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Garza was accused of being a major drug dealer and convicted of
smuggling more than 1,000 kilos of marijuana from Mexico between
1982 and 1992, as well as of three murders.
</P>
<P>
   At the punishment phase of Garza's trial, prosecutors introduced
testimony that Garza committed four murders in Mexico. But he had
never been prosecuted for the murders.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the history of the modern death penalty, we are unaware of
any case where prosecutors introduce evidence of unadjudicated
foreign crimes at the penalty phase,'' said Bruce W. Gilchrist, a
lawyer with Hogan &AMP; Hartson, which has joined Garza's defense team
pro bono.
</P>
<P>
   Federal courts have rejected the claim that this testimony
violated Garza's constitutional protections. But the Inter-American
Commission on Human Rights, a body of the Organization of American
States, is investigating whether it violated the American
Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man, which the United
States has signed.
</P>
<P>
   Pending the outcome of that investigation, the organization has
called on the Clinton administration to delay Garza's execution.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wis., sent a letter to the
president and Reno asking them to suspend federal executions, and
he has introduced legislation calling for a national moratorium on
the death penalty.

   DEEP DISCOUNTS FAIL TO LIFT SALES OF AFFORDABLE VEHICLES
</P>
<P>
   Automakers say that despite recent deep discounts, auto sales
have not picked up in June from the relatively subdued pace of May,
providing evidence to the Federal Reserve Board that recent
interest-rate increases may be slowing the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   Auto executives and dealers say sales of luxury cars and sport
utility vehicles remain extremely strong. But the mass market for
more affordable cars, minivans, sport utility vehicles and pickup
trucks has softened as middle-class families have become leery of
borrowing money at ever steeper rates.

   AT&AMP;T submitted a new proposal that would give consumers more
flexibility in seeking to save money on long-distance calls but
that appeared to fall short of stemming the outcry from consumer
groups and federal regulators over its plans to raise certain costs
for tens of millions of people. AT&AMP;T said it would eliminate the $3
monthly minimum charge for low-volume callers and offer a wider
variety of options to reduce charges for people who make most calls
on certain weekend days.

stocks came under selling pressure for the second consecutive day
as investors locked in profits after a weeks-long run-up. The Dow
Jones industrial average finished up 28.63 points, to 10,404.75,
while the Nasdaq composite index fell 91.50 points, or 2.3 percent,

   A top Chinese trade negotiator warned that his country would not

countries that they receive the same trade privileges that China
had negotiated with the European Union and the United States.

NAPSTER TRYING TO RESOLVE LEGAL PROBLEMS WITH MUSIC INDUSTRY 
 &HT;     BY BENNY EVANGELISTA
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
In light of MP3.com Inc.'s recent multimillion-dollar settlements
with the recording industry, Napster Inc. executives could be
trying to avoid an even costlier fate by settling their own legal
squabble with the world's major record labels.
<P>
   Although industry sources said no formal settlement talks have
begun, Napster officials have reportedly had informal discussions
with the record companies to resolve the copyright infringement
suit against the San Mateo startup.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Recording Industry Association of America asked
for a preliminary injunction to stop Napster users from sharing
songs owned by the RIAA's members. That move was a way of ``setting
up the legal argument that the major labels have been financially
hurt by Napster in a significant way,'' said Malcolm Maclachlan,
media analyst for International Data Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Legally speaking, that's using the left hook that sets up the
right cross for the knockout,'' Maclachlan said. ``Napster sees the
left hook coming and wants to call a truce.''
</P>
<P>
   The RIAA originally filed suit in U.S. District Court in San
Francisco in December claiming Napster's popular program allows
music fans to share illegal copies of songs with each other via the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Napster spokesman Dan Wool said he could not comment on
published reports that interim CEO Hank Barry, a partner with
Hummer Winblad Venture Partners, which has invested $15 million in
Napster, was talking to record industry executives about a
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   However, Wool said that while Napster remains confident it can
win the case, company officials have also made no secret of the
fact that ``they've been talking to everybody about everything.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to work on (business) models that will be fair to
the artists and the industry,'' Wool said.
</P>
<P>
   Internet music portal MP3.com Inc. of San Diego recently settled
unrelated copyright infringement suits with two record labels.
MP3.com agreed to pay roughly $20 million apiece to the two record
companies and is negotiating similar deals with the other three. In
that case, the RIAA had already won a ruling finding MP3.com had
violated copyright laws with its virtual music storage service.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations against Napster are far more serious and
potentially costly if U.S. District Judge Marilyn Hall Patel should
rule that the Napster program allows its 10 million users to swap
pirated songs.
</P>
<P>
   And Hummer Winblad does not want to see its $15 million
investment go down the drain if Patel pulls the plug on Napster,
Maclachlan said.
</P>
<P>
   The RIAA is using internal Napster memos against the company. In
a brief filed in court, the RIAA quoted from a memo sent by
co-founder Sean Parker to co-founder John Fanning, the uncle of
Napster creator Sean Fanning, that addresses music piracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Users will understand that they are improving their experience
by providing information about their tastes without linking that
information to a name or address or other sensitive data that might
endanger them (especially since they are exchanging pirated
music),'' the RIAA quoted from Parker's memo.

MIGHTY WAL-MART RULES RETAIL WORLD WITH IRON FIST  &HT;     BY CAROL EMERT
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Few retailers, if any, have weathered as many black eyes as
Wal-Mart Inc. The discount king, which turns 50 this year, has been
branded a killer of downtown communities, a union buster and an
exploiter of underage sweatshop workers.
<P>
   Twice in the past four years, immigrant seamstresses making
Wal-Mart's Kathie Lee Gifford clothing were found to be working in
sweatshop conditions in New York, with workweeks as long as 80
hours and little to no pay. Multiple investigations of overseas
contractor factories have found abuses such as seven-day workweeks,
forced overtime, the use of child labor and hazardous working
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart doesn't deny sewing shop problems and says it has taken
steps to improve conditions. But even as the retailer incurs the
enmity of everyone from human rights activists to historical
preservationists, Wal-Mart has achieved a level of dominance
without parallel in modern times.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1950 by Sam Walton, whose early stores were called
``Walton 5 &AMP; 10,'' Wal-Mart, of Bentonville, Ark., is now the
single biggest retailer on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   Its sales are estimated to hit a stunning $195.7 billion this
year _ more than double those of the world's second-biggest
merchant, German grocer Metro AG.
</P>
<P>
   New Wal-Mart stores often face opposition, but the company
usually prevails. This year, Wal-Mart expects to open 235 stores on
top of its 3,030 in the United States and 1,019 in eight foreign
countries, from South Korea to Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   The Bay Area remains relatively under-Wal-Marted, with only 18
Wal-Mart discount stores and two Sam's Club warehouses throughout
Alameda, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Napa, Sonoma and Solano counties.
Contra Costa, San Francisco and Marin counties have no Wal-Marts or
Sam's Clubs at all.
</P>
<P>
   But that is changing. Wal-Mart has stated its intention to fill
in underserved West Coast markets. Additional locations are already
under way in Fremont and Napa.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the company will begin opening its mammoth
``supercenters'' here _ 200,000-square-foot formats featuring both
groceries and general merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   A survey by WSL Strategic Retail, a New York consulting firm,
illustrates just how deeply ingrained Wal-Mart has become in
American shopping habits.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 40 percent of people surveyed by WSL, all of whom were
women and the primary shoppers in their households, had shopped at
Wal-Mart in the previous week.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety percent of those polled had visited a mass merchant in
the past three months _ knocking supermarkets, at 83 percent, from
the top spot for The number of people shopping at drug stores,
department stores, malls and home improvement stores is also
falling as more people of all income levels fill their shopping
needs at discounters _ mostly Wal-Mart, said Wendy Liebmann,
president of WSL.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart's dominance occurs not by accident, but by a highly
strategic design. Wal-Mart watchers identify two traits that have
gotten the company where it is today: a single-minded, even
ruthless focus on growth, and the extraordinary business smarts and
discipline necessary to pull it off.
</P>
<P>
   Because it wields more clout than any other retailer, Wal-Mart
can _ and does _ squeeze its suppliers for rock-bottom wholesale
prices, allowing it to undercut competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, low prices are the main reason people shop at
Wal-Mart, although its broad selection, convenience and customer
service also get high marks.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Wal-Mart's largest vendors maintain staff in Bentonville
to keep their biggest client happy. And Wal-Mart isn't bashful
about asking for favors, including extremely cushy terms of credit.
Every penny saved gives Wal-Mart more of an edge over its rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Another key cost-saving measure for Wal-Mart _ and one that has
proven an enormous public-relations headache _ is selling apparel
made in low-paying sewing shops, mostly in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   Activists such as the National Labor Committee, whose
congressional testimony sparked the Kathie Lee Gifford furor in
1996, have toured Wal-Mart's contractor factories and reported
serious abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Similar allegations have been made against many companies, from
Gap to Nordstrom to Tommy Hilfiger. But as retailing's 800-pound
gorilla, Wal-Mart attracts more flak than most.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart promised to institute independent factory monitoring
after the Gifford episode. ``We admitted publicly that we are
working to improve conditions around the world and we began
requiring suppliers to ensure that every factory conforms to local
workplace laws and that there was no illegal forced or child
labor,'' said Wal-Mart spokesman Tom Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart is doing its best when it comes to apparel sourcing,
Williams said. ``The key thing is that we're not perfect. We try to
be as open as we can, and we're going to continue ... to be as open
and caring as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Such assurances fail to placate Wal-Mart's foes. Charles
Kernaghan, executive director of the National Labor Committee,
continues to issue reports on factory conditions, although he
complains that his efforts don't get as much press as they used to.
</P>
<P>
   His organization, whose biggest source of funding is the
Unitarian Church, is considering suing Wal-Mart to disclose the
factories it uses. Wal-Mart has declined to furnish the
information, citing competitive concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Labor costs are also an issue in the United States, where
Wal-Mart's 885,000 employees make it the country's largest
private-sector employer. Williams called Wal-Mart's pay and
benefits ``very, very competitive,'' but he declined to comment on
reports that most sales associates earn well under $10 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to unionize Wal-Mart stores, which would give workers
more leverage over pay and hours, have been repeatedly thwarted.
</P>
<P>
   That situation seemed to be changing earlier this year, when
butchers in a Texas store voted to join a union _ the first
pro-union vote in a domestic Wal-Mart. But a few days later,
Wal-Mart said it would phase out butcher shops in that region, a
decision it attributed to store economics and not the union vote.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas case aside, many Wal-Mart employees are loyal to
Wal-Mart and not interested in unions. Wal-Mart cultivates a strong
corporate culture that sits well with many workers. Every store
holds a daily morning pep rally in which staffers shout ``the
Wal-Mart cheer'' (``Gimme a W!'' ``W!'' etc.)
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart also lets employees buy company shares at a discount, a
popular policy as long as Wal-Mart stock continues to climb.
(Shares closed at $53.75 yesterday, up $1.25. In the past year, the
stock is up 21 percent.)
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart has even turned its annual shareholder meeting into a
massive perk for workers. In an Arkansas sporting arena, thousands
of associates gather annually to wave signs and cheer as executives
give folksy speeches.
</P>
<P>
   Other attractions have included morning exercise sessions with
Richard Simmons, appearances by country music artists and a
testimonial from Barbara Bush about how much George loves tomato
sauce from Sam's Club.
</P>
<P>
   While employees are important, the key to any retailer's success
is keeping its customers happy. ``Greeters'' at the entrance of
every Wal-Mart put a smiling local face on the company. But
Wal-Mart's back-end systems are the real key to customer
satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart's distribution and inventory-management systems are
considered the best in the industry. Its sophisticated computers
track which items are selling in each store and what needs to be
reordered. This helps ensure that its shelves are stocked and
shortages are rare.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart has been equally strategic in deciding what it will
carry, specifically in its decision to become a grocer. In 1988,
the company opened its first supercenter combo store, a move that
sent shivers through the grocery industry.
</P>
<P>
   That fear was well founded. Twelve years later, Wal-Mart is the
largest grocery seller in theUnited States with an estimated $51
billion in 1999 sales compared with $45 billion for runner-up
Kroger Inc.
</P>
<P>
   California supermarkets are already nervous about Wal-Mart
supercenters, although the format has not yet premiered on the West
Coast. Last year, grocers and labor unions backed a superstore ban
that was passed by the California Legislature, but then vetoed.
</P>
<P>
   Groceries not only give Wal-Mart an enormous source of sales,
they also provide a one-stop-shopping synergy that boosts sales of
general merchandise by 20 to 40 percent, said Sandy Skrovan, a
consultant with PricewaterhouseCoopers.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart has even begun opening small conventional grocery
stores called Neighborhood Markets for people who don't want to
hike around a supercenter. For fans of electronic shopping, the
company is beefing up its Internet presence.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart's opponents admit that their efforts have had little
impact on the retailing giant, whose earnings reports consistently
show both strong sales and robust profits.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart's investors, meanwhile, just keep getting wealthier.
Sam Walton's heirs are worth a combined $85 billion, the same as
Bill Gates, Forbes magazine estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-Wal-Mart forces face an uphill battle because the company's
formula is so irresistible. Wal-Mart's core customers ``need to
stretch a dollar for their families' sake,'' allowed Kernaghan.
``Where else are they going to shop, Brooks Bros.?''
</P>
<P>
   But for Kernaghan, the fight is nothing less than a moral
imperative.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wal-Mart controls more of the market than any retailer ever
has,'' Kernaghan said. ``When you're talking about Wal-Mart, you're
fighting for what kind of a country this is going to be.''

MERCURY NEWS REACHES PACT WITH UNIONS 
 &HT;     BY CAROLYN SAID 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
SAN FRANCISCO _ The San Jose Mercury News reached a last-minute
agreement with its unions Friday for an eight-year contract,
averting a threatened strike.
<P>
   Representatives of five unions agreed to a new contract that
would grant annual raises of 4.15 percent for reporters and 4.63
percent for lower-pay classifications. Portions of those increases
would go to health and welfare programs and pension plans.
</P>
<P>
   The contract also includes a $1,000 signing bonus for full-time
employees and $300 for part-timers. It expands same-sex domestic
partner benefits to include leaves for bereavement, medical care
and maternity or paternity.
</P>
<P>
   The tentative contract is retroactive to Nov. 1, 1998, and runs
until June 30, 2006.
</P>
<P>
   The unions were bargaining on behalf of about 1,275 of the
paper's 1,500 employees. Union members will decide whether to
ratify the contract in early July.
</P>
<P>
   Employees who had been working without a contract _ or raise _
for the past 20 months were irate that the region's economic boom
was passing them by, while the cost of living soared. The current
top minimum wage for Mercury News reporters is $983.60 a week,
although newspapers in general often choose to pay more for certain
employees.
</P>
<P>
   According to an economic analysis by the San Jose Newspaper
Guild, the cost of a two-bedroom apartment in Santa Clara County
has risen from $885 a month in 1995, when the last contract was
signed, to more than $1,400 today.
</P>
<P>
   The unions had asked for a 10 percent raise in April, and
management offered 2 percent. The unions were prepared to strike at
noon Friday if no agreement had been reached. That deadline was
extended an hour and a half, after a marathon all-night negotiating
session.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's expensive to live down here,'' said Bill Wyland, an
organizer with the Newspaper Guild, based in Washington, D.C.
``It's a very profitable paper but they've had a 25 percent
turnover in the past five years. They needed to offer something
that would keep people at the paper or they'll have everyone
jumping to all the dot-coms.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Rasky, an acting associate professor in the journalism
department at the University of California at Berkeley, said,
``Speaking as someone who has only watched this from the outside
and doesn't know the internal issues, it would certainly seem that
the Merc is trying to retain experienced people and attract
smarter, younger people. They are under enormous pressure from
online companies who regard the Merc as the first place to raid.''
</P>
<P>
   Rasky said uncertainties in the Bay Area newspaper climate may
have hastened a settlement. A judge is now deciding whether to
allow Hearst Corp.'s planned purchase of The San Francisco
Chronicle to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is so up in the air that it's hard to say whether
they were responding to perceived competition from a one-newspaper
town in San Francisco with a deep-pocketed owner, or whether they
view this as potentially a great opportunity because their
competitor in San Francisco may not be as strong as they once
imagined.''
</P>
<P>
   Luther Jackson, executive officer of the San Jose Newspaper
Guild, said the wage increases are among the largest granted U.S.
newspaper employees in recent times.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues at the 300,000-circulation Mercury News jumped 6.5
percent last year, to $306.3 million, heavily fueled by classified
ads for high-tech jobs.

ISRAEL'S PREPARATION FOR RIOTS ALARMS PALESTINIANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Repeats with more precise hed.)  
(See also ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Near the ancient caves of Bet Guvrin in Israel, army
officials say, there is a secret Palestinian village on a hill. It
consists of about 15 houses and a mosque. It is for Israelis only.
</P>
<P>
   The village is a simulation, a three-dimensional stage set that
the Israeli army uses to train its troops in occupation techniques,
riot control and all-out battle. It is populated by soldiers
playing the roles of what an army official called ``the enemy'':
Palestinian stone throwers and police officers, even journalists
and homemakers. In the year-old mock village, the army experiments
with techniques for controlling and reacting to violence in a way
that is meant to minimize the risk to Palestinian civilians.
</P>
<P>
   For the Israeli soldiers trained there, the experience can be
dizzying. On the one hand, they are engaged in active relationship
with Palestinian troops in the West Bank, riding together on
patrols and sitting together in offices, sharing data, coordinating
arrests, jointly calming tensions. On the other, they are readying
themselves for a defensive battle against them and their people.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is exactly the double mission we deal with,'' a senior army
official said. ``On one channel, we really know the Palestinian
officers on a personal level. On the other, we prepare for events
like those that took place in May.'' That was when Israeli and
Palestinian soldiers engaged in extended gunfire exchanges in the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wear two heads,'' he added, ``and educate the soldiers to
think two ways at once.''
</P>
<P>
   In a way that has alarmed Palestinian leaders, the Israeli army
has been putting out the word that it is gearing up for riots and
more as the negotiations advance and a September deadline for a
final agreement approaches. While the Israeli government is talking
peace with the Palestinians, the Israeli army is busy preparing for
violent conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gen. Shaul Mofaz, the Israeli army chief, warned last week
that his forces would use helicopters and tanks to quash riots, if
need be. ``Anyone who hurts Israeli soldiers will be hurt,'' he
said. ``And if we need tanks, tanks will come. And if we need
combat helicopters, combat helicopters will come.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, the army said it would start equipping West Bank
settlements with riot control gear, including tear gas and rubber
bullets. This horrified the Palestinians, although the settlements
are already armed with government-provided weapons and live
ammunition, and the army has trained an emergency squad of reserve
officers and soldiers who live in each settlement. All settlers
trained and armed are cleared by the security services.
</P>
<P>
   The reigning assessment of Israeli military experts is that the
Palestinians want their future state to be born through struggle.
They do not want ``their state to be handed to them on a silver
platter,'' a senior army official said. ``They want not an
independence war, but maybe an independence struggle.''
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian officials are labeling this kind of talk a ``bad
faith'' approach to the peace effort, which sours the mood on the
ground in the West Bank and adversely affects the negotiations
themselves. Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, speaking on
Thursday in Ramallah, said he had immediately alerted the
international authorities that the Israelis' bellicose talk was
irresponsible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We informed the United Nations, the European Union, the
American administration, Russia, the nonaligned countries, China
and Japan,'' he said. ``We explained to them that this is wrong,
not only for the Palestinian track. It endangers peace in the
Middle East.''

 JERUSALEM: Middle East.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a letter to Kofi Annan, the U.N. secretary-general, a
Palestinian representative warned that the Israeli army could set
off violence with its threatening statements. ``Such threats of
extreme force cannot be taken lightly as the fragile and tense
situation in the area could quickly destabilize and words could be
quickly translated into action,'' wrote Somaia Barghouti, a member
of the Palestinians' observer mission at the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli army says that it does not want to raise tensions,
but that it does want to be prepared. Military officials point to
the riots in May, which left six Palestinians dead as well as
almost 1,000 Palestinians and 60 Israelis wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli and Palestinian experts alike agree that those riots
demonstrated that Arafat will permit or even encourage violent
eruptions in the West Bank and Gaza. Israelis say he has used and
is expected again to use violence to put pressure on Israel during
the mood swings of the negotiations. And they note that, as May
demonstrated, street riots can get out of hand and end in
full-fledged gun battles.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian opposition leaders have pointed to the Israeli troop
withdrawal from Lebanon in May as evidence that armed struggle
might accomplish more than talk. Palestinian officials still firmly
advocate negotiation as the road to achievement, but they warn
Israelis not to test their reaction to threats of military might.
</P>
<P>
   Jabril Rajoub, the security chief in the West Bank, said Gen.
Mofaz's words were ``a declaration of war.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If he thinks his tanks and helicopters will be met by the
white flag of surrender, he is mistaken,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After initially inviting a reporter to visit the mock
Palestinian village in Bet Guvrin, Israeli army officials later
decided that the moment was ``too sensitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Many professional armies and police forces train in simulated
settings.
</P>
<P>
   But the idea of Israel re-creating a Palestinian village to be
used for military drills is a potentially explosive one against the
backdrop of this week's back and forth between Israeli and
Palestinian officials.
</P>
<P>
   Although the village opened about a year ago, its existence is
not widely known. ``You can simulate one-to-one what happens in the
territories,'' an army official said, ``how to use force, and if
need be, helicopters; techniques for dealing with riots, arrests.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is standard for us to provide training for warfare in a
developed area,'' he said. ``But we've never had such a realistic
setting before.''
</P>
<P>
   The village is just one part of the army's regrouping after the
deadly skirmishes between Israelis and Palestinians following
Israel's opening of an entrance to the Western Wall tunnel in
September 1996. During the tunnel riots, the stone-throwing and
rubber-bullet-shooting that typified the Palestinian-Israeli
confrontations during the uprising of 1988-93 gave way to exchanges
of live ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   The army established a project called ``low intensity
conflict.'' It is based on preparations to respond to more
sophisticated violence, involving not only automatic weapons but
also what Israeli intelligence analysts say may be a cache of
hand-held antiaircraft and antitank missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Most Israeli officers in the West Bank are now elite
ex-paratroopers. The jeeps and other vehicles are now armored.
Tanks have been positioned through the zones of conflict. Soldiers
are trained in how to be snipers and to protect themselves from
snipers.
</P>
<P>
   And the Israeli army keeps a live map of points of friction in
the West Bank that could ignite a conflagration, including the
village of Sulfit adjacent to the settlement of Ariel. The goal,
Israeli officials stress, is to anticipate and avert conflict. But,
they added, they have to be prepared for worst-case scenarios, even
as peace talks are supposedly aiming to end the conflict entirely.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think the Palestinians can conquer a settlement,'' an
army official said, ``but they can come to the fence and shoot.
That's why we have trained and equipped the settlers. We don't want
them to take on their own security unless there's an emergency. But
there might be an emergency.''

NAPSTER MOVES TO SETTLE WITH RECORD LABELS 
 &HT;     BY BENNY EVANGELISTA
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
In light of MP3.com Inc.'s recent multimillion-dollar settlements
with the recording industry, Napster Inc. executives could be
trying to avoid an even costlier fate by settling their own legal
squabble with the world's major record labels.
<P>
   Although industry sources said no formal settlement talks have
begun, Napster officials have reportedly had informal discussions
with record companies to resolve their copyright infringement
lawsuit against the San Mateo startup.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Recording Industry Association of America asked
for a preliminary injunction to stop Napster users from sharing
songs owned by association members. That move was a way of
``setting up the legal argument that the major labels have been
financially hurt by Napster in a significant way,'' said Malcolm
Maclachlan, media analyst for International Data Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Legally speaking, that's using the left hook that sets up the
right cross for the knockout,'' Maclachlan said. ``Napster sees the
left hook coming and wants to call a truce.''
</P>
<P>
   The recording association originally filed suit in U.S. District
Court in San Francisco in December, claiming Napster's popular
program allows music fans to share illegal copies of songs with
each other via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Napster spokesman Dan Wool said he could not comment on
published reports that interim CEO Hank Barry, a partner with
Hummer Winblad Venture Partners, which has invested $15 million in
Napster, was talking to record industry executives about a
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   However, Wool said that while Napster remains confident it can
win the case, company officials have also made no secret that
``they've been talking to everybody about everything.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to work on (business) models that will be fair to
the artists and the industry,'' Wool said.
</P>
<P>
   Internet music portal MP3.com of San Diego recently settled
unrelated copyright infringement suits with two record labels.
MP3.com agreed to pay roughly $20 million to each of the two record
companies and is negotiating similar deals with three more. In that
case, the recording association had already won a ruling that
MP3.com had violated copyright laws with its virtual music storage
service.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations against Napster are far more serious and
potentially costly if U.S. District Judge Marilyn Hall Patel should
rule that the Napster program allows its 10 million users to swap
pirated songs.
</P>
<P>
   And Hummer Winblad does not want to see its $15 million
investment go down the drain if Patel pulls the plug on Napster,
Maclachlan said.
</P>
<P>
   The recording group is using internal Napster memos against the
company. In a brief filed in court, the recording group quoted from
a memo sent by co-founder Sean Parker to co-founder John Fanning,
the uncle of Napster creator Sean Fanning, that addresses music
piracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Users will understand that they are improving their experience
by providing information about their tastes without linking that
information to a name or address or other sensitive data that might
endanger them (especially since they are exchanging pirated
music),'' Parker's memo said, according to the recording group.

   Change comes slowly to Mexico, the country with the world's
longest-serving ruling political party. Ever since the emergence in
the 1920s of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), power in
Mexico has changed hands through backroom deals in which the
incumbent president has chosen his successor _ whose subsequent
electoral victory was a formality, achieved when necessary by
fraud. No longer. That makes Mexico's presidential election on July
2 a historic _ and hopeful _ event. &QL;

   On the face of it, the past decade has been a splendid time for
democrats. All over the world, dictatorships, whether communist or
military, have been in retreat; demand for ballot boxes, election
monitors and people who know how to run parliaments has been as hot
as for Pokemon cards. Indeed, for the first time in history, the
proportion of the world's population that lives in countries that
can claim to be broadly democratic has climbed past 50 percent.
Closer scrutiny, however, finds several imposters in the crowd:
countries still ``in transition'' towards full democracy. &QL;

   Three months after Vladimir Putin won Russia's presidency, some
ugly things have been happening in his benighted country. The new
man, a former KGB officer, has been cracking his whip. He has
sounded belligerent towards several of Russia's former vassal
states on its rim, and shows little sign of softening towards
Chechnya, the rebel republic devastated at his command. Things may
yet change but, for the time being at least, Putin remains on
probation. &QL;

   Health-care spending is everywhere on the increase. In 1948, it

the World Health Organization, the figure is 7.9 percent and
rising. Governments and health-care providers have much to learn
from studying the structure and performance of other countries'
health systems. But what may matter more for public policy than the

   SAN FRANCISCO _ On June 22, the California Environmental
Dialogue, a new 32-member group including _ improbably _ General
Motors, Chevron, BP Amoco, the Sierra Club and Environmental
Defense, published a paper on the state's transport policy. In it,
they endorsed the principle that the ``user should pay'' for road
use and that ``tolls and congestion pricing should be utilized
whenever possible'' _ a first for the big oil and car firms.
Drivers' groups, however, are opposed to the idea. Kevin Murray, a

middle-class fantasy dreamed up by ``some dweeb in a dark room

THE SPORTING MUSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today's laughing-out-loud edition of The Sporting Muse:
</P>
<P>
   Based on some of the caterwauling by armchair quarterbacks out
there, ABC Sports apparently hired Hitler and Hannibal Lechter as
Al Michaels' partners on Monday Night Football.
</P>
<P>
   There's no denying that the hiring of comedian Dennis Miller as
a member of the MNF cast -- shall we call him a comedic analyst or
a football pun-dit? -- was a stunner, and that it changes the
standards of what passes as a sportscaster.
</P>
<P>
   But it doesn't deserve all of the negative reaction its received
in some of the more conservative sports parlors. Three points come
to mind in assessing the decision:
</P>
<P>
   1. If the MNF gig was destined to go to a non-traditional type,
who better than the most well-read and sophisticated comic? This
isn't like hiring Henny Youngman. Miller doesn't play a role like
an actor, he doesn't have an agenda like Rush Limbaugh, and he
takes everything he does pretty seriously.
</P>
<P>
   2. Has anything you've heard from the mouth of Boomer Esiason,
Frank Gifford or Dan Dierdorf on MNF the last five years been
memorable? Esiason was a waste of time, Dierdorf was on autopilot
for three years, and I defy anyone to recall a cogent comment from
the Giffer dating back to the Cosell and Meredith era.
</P>
<P>
   For that matter, what exactly did Cosell or Meredith bring to
the MNF table beyond their notoriety? It's easy to romanticize that
period because of its impact, but the reality is that people tuned
in to hear Meredith poke holes in Cosell's ego. Cosell could no
more breakdown a pass prevent defense than Julia Child.
</P>
<P>
   Michaels and Dan Fouts will be there to talk as much strategy
and analysis as needed, and don't be surprised if Miller has as
much insight as Esiason.
</P>
<P>
   3. His hiring is perhaps the clearest sign yet that sports on
television is purely an entertainment vehicle. You and I might take
sports a bit more seriously, and consider it part of a city's
sociological make-up or hold it up to the same standards as an HMO
or City Hall. But for TV it's just well-dressed programming, and
it's time everyone in TV copped to that fact.
</P>
<P>
   4. Did you stop to consider the competition? That may be the big
story. ABC launched a search for the best football analysts in the
business and they came up empty.
</P>
<P>
   The top available candidates were Sterling Sharpe, Steve Young
and Dan Fouts, which is enough to make one cry. So forgive me if I
forgive ABC for hiring a comic. ...
</P>
<P>
   Larry Bird wasn't about to break any coaching records held by
Red Auerbach, Phil Jackson or even Pat Riley, but the cost of his
retiring as coach of the Pacers will be large.
</P>
<P>
   Except for a couple of playing time decisions related to Reggie
Miller, Bird used his personnel superbly, and he only went to the
Hack-a-Shaq strategy when it was a last resort. And he was as
bothered by it as anyone in Laker gold, too. ...
</P>
<P>
   Now that the NBA season is finally over, attention can be turned
to the Dodgers -- if their season isn't already over.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are within touch of the N.L. West lead, but all of
the problems that faced them at the beginning of the season are
still present -- an inconsistent bullpen and holes up the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the pressing problems can be traced in part to G.M.
Kevin Malone, too. Tommy Lasorda goofed by not reading the fine
print when he traded for Jeff Shaw, but it was Malone who lavished
him with a three-year contract -- or a year-plus more than he had
ever proven himself as a major league closer. Now he's hurting, and
the team is on the hook for $6 million next year and $7 million in
2002 (with a $1.5 million buyout).
</P>
<P>
   The contract Malone gave Carlos Perez has hamstrung decisions
regarding the makeup of the pitching staff. Todd Hundley was
damaged goods when the Dodgers traded for him, and now he's
disabled. Likewise Devon White, who was age-wary when Malone signed
him as a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' modest 17-17 home record doesn't instill a lot of
confidence in catching Arizona, either, and the Dodgers don't see
the D- Backs again until September. ...
</P>
<P>
   Deja vu: Now that the NBA season is finally over, attention can
be turned to the Angels -- if their season isn't already over.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels were in touch with the rest of the A.L. West before
the Oakland A's and Seattle Mariners just launched a sprint. The
fact the Angeles are over .500 despite a quilted pitching staff is
a salute to Mike Scioscia.
</P>
<P>
   But even should Tim Belcher and Ken Hill return healthy, they
still may not have enough pitching to hang with the A's and
Mariners. What's worse, both teams re-constructed their pitching
staffs at the same that the Angels clearly needed pitching
renovation.
</P>
<P>
   The ten games the Angels have against the A's and Mariners
beginning next week look pivotal. They don't need to catch either
team, but they do need to stay close. ...
</P>
<P>
   As much as I'd like to see Tim Salmon earn his first-ever
All-Star bid, Darin Erstad and Troy Glaus are both more deserving.
The Dodgers' Gary Sheffield will likely be their only all-star,
although a case could be made for Chan Ho Park. ...
</P>
<P>
   The idea of the Cubs trading Sammy Sosa is like trading the
family pet. Why would you? He's not the problem in Chicago. He
certainly doesn't cost them runs -- his 64 RBI through Thursday was
second in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Don Baylor wants Sosa to become a more complete player,
whatever that means. Does he want Sosa to shorten up and hit behind
the runner? Does he want him to steal 40 bases at a time when the
steal is passe, and despite plenty of statistical evidence that
stolen bases are minimally important in the long run?
</P>
<P>
   The fact Baylor spent the end of his career as a DH doesn't help
his cause in urging Sosa to become a ``complete'' player. ...
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox may be interested in trading for Sosa. But despite
all of the lore about the Green Monster and what it does for
right-handed power-hitters, Fenway actually favors left-handed
hitters. The Sox have three switch-hitters and two left-handed
hitters in their daily lineup. ...
</P>
<P>
   I love the man dearly, but I saw way too much of Magic Johnson
during the Lakers' celebration. &QL;

   Change comes slowly to Mexico, the country with the world's
longest-serving ruling political party. Ever since the emergence in
the 1920s of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), power in
Mexico has changed hands through backroom deals in which the
incumbent president has chosen his successor _ whose subsequent
electoral victory was a formality, achieved when necessary by
fraud. No longer. That makes Mexico's presidential election on July
2 a historic _ and hopeful _ event. &QL;

   On the face of it, the past decade has been a splendid time for
democrats. All over the world, dictatorships, whether communist or
military, have been in retreat; demand for ballot boxes, election
monitors and people who know how to run parliaments has been as hot
as for Pokemon cards. Indeed, for the first time in history, the
proportion of the world's population that lives in countries that
can claim to be broadly democratic has climbed past 50 percent.
Closer scrutiny, however, finds several imposters in the crowd:
countries still ``in transition'' towards full democracy. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ In a caustic exchange with a senior Justice
Department prosecutor two months ago, Vice President Al Gore denied
being told by aides that a 1996 luncheon at a Buddhist temple was a
fund-raising event, according to a transcript of the interview that
the vice president's lawyers released Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sure as hell don't recall having _ I sure as hell did not
have any conversations with anyone saying this is a fund-raising
event,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's angry denial was contained in a 123-page transcript of a
four-hour interview in which the head of the Justice Department's
campaign finance unit questioned Gore at the vice presidential
mansion about his fund-raising activities prior to the 1996
election.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president disclosed the interview transcript Friday
afternoon, scrambling to blunt the potential damage of the revived
Justice Department inquiry of his truthfulness in answering
questions about his efforts to raise money. Still, it risked
prolonging an issue that has dogged Gore's presidential campaign
and threatens to bring renewed com- parisons to the scandals of the
Clin- ton administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always cooperated fully,'' Gore told reporters aboard
Air Force II Friday afternoon, as he flew from Denver to Palo Alto,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have admitted that I have made mistakes in fund raising,''
he said in the middle of a chaotic day in which he and his aides
sought to contain the latest problem to engulf his presidential
campaign. ``But I want the American people to know that I have
always told the truth on this matter. I have always cooperated
fully. And I want the entire transcript to be out there and I want
people to be able to judge it for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Gore said, ``I think the truth is my friend in this. The
truth, the full truth and nothing but the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   In the April interview, Gore was confronted with questions about
a wide array of campaign finance issues, posed by a clearly
skeptical and at times incredulous prosecutor, Robert Conrad , the
head of the campaign finance task force. Besides the Buddhist
temple luncheon, Gore was asked whether the White House coffees
were fund-raising events and, more recently, what he knew about
missing e-mail messages from his office.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's decision to release the transcript came one day after the
Justice Department confirmed that Conrad had recommended that
Attorney General Janet Reno appoint a special counsel to
investigate the truthfulness of Gore's statements about his
political fund raising.
</P>
<P>
   But the vice president also questioned the timing of the
disclosure of the new inquiry. ``Here we are four months before an
election that takes place every four years,'' Gore told reporters.
``You can read into that what you want to.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas Friday seized on the renewed
inquiry of Gore's fund-raising activities. ``I reiterate my call
for a new tone in Washington which is going to require a new
administration in Washington,'' Bush said. ``People are sick and
tired of all this stuff and the best way to start anew is with a
new administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has clearly made the political calculation that the public
will view the transcript, filled with questions about events that
occurred as long ago as 1989, as old news.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have full confidence in the judgment of the American
people,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's answers during the April 18 interview at times appeared
to conflict with conclusions reached by a 1997 inquiry by a Senate
panel that investigated campaign finance inquiries. But Gore
dismissed its report as ``a highly partisan document.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Gore insisted that the 103 White House coffees
held in 1995 and 1996 with campaign donors were not ``fund-raising
tools'' used to raise money for the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate panel, led by Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., found in
1997 that supporters who had attended the coffee events between
November 1995 and October 1996 contributed a total of $7.7 million
within one month of having attended the coffees.
</P>
<P>
   During the questioning, Gore recalled that he had remembered
``only one that I attended briefly.'' But the Senate panel found
that he had hosted 23 coffees and attended eight with President
Clinton. Confronted with the contradictory information about the
coffees, Gore said, ``That seems inaccurate to me.''
</P>
<P>
   As a legal matter, Gore's apparent misstatements may fall short
of sufficient grounds to show that Gore illegally perjured himself,
a law enforcement official said Friday. That is one reason, the
officials said, Reno has, so far, shown no sign that she is
prepared to refer the case to an outside prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, after searing internal battles in 1997 and 1998, refused
to seek an independent counsel to investigate Gore's fund-raising
efforts over the objections of some of her senior advisers.
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Still, Conrad is not alone in his recommendation to refer the
case to a special prosecutor, the officials said Friday. FBI
Director Louis Freeh also favors a special counsel and has long
urged Reno to do so.
</P>
<P>
   During the interview with Gore, Conrad led the questioning,
assisted by two FBI agents. Conrad devoted a majority of the
four-hour interview to Gore's understanding of the true purpose of
the Buddhist temple event, a subject that Gore had not been asked
about in his four previous interviews with federal investigators
from the campaign finance unit.
</P>
<P>
   Conrad repeatedly showed Gore numerous memos _ all of which had
been made public years ago _ from aides that suggested that it was
known that the event was intended to raise money.
</P>
<P>
   ``You were aware in late February, were you not, that there was
a goal of raising $108 million by the DNC?'' Conrad asked,
referring to Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' the vice president answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then a couple of months later there is a DNC-sponsored event
at the temple and it didn't raise any fund-raising issues in your
mind?'' Conrad went on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not know this was a fund-raiser,'' Gore answered.
</P>
<P>
   But later in the interview, Gore inadvertently referred to the
temple event as a ``fund-raiser.'' The vice president's personal
lawyer, James F. Neal, quickly advised Gore that he had misspoken.
</P>
<P>
   Neal told the vice president, ``I thought you said previously
you didn't, you still don't know whether it was a fund-raiser.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore then replied, ``Well, that's right. That is more accurate.
Let me, let me amend that. That was first time it was alleged to
be, to have been a fund-raiser.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hsi Lai event, held on April 29, 1996 in Hacienda Heights,
Calif., was one of the most embarrassing episodes of the 1996
campaign finance scandal. The event was organized by Maria Hsia, a
longtime friend and political ally of the vice president who had
collected money before the event from monks and nuns, some of whom
had taken vows of poverty.
</P>
<P>
   As a tax exempt religious institution, the temple was not
allowed to serve as a venue for political fund raising or itself to
make political donations. Gore was asked repeatedly in late 1996
and 1997 about his knowledge of whether the event was a
fund-raiser, and according to Conrad responded with differing
statements.
</P>
<P>
   Hsia was convicted in March for hiding $109,000 in illegal
contributions and making false statements to federal regulators
about the temple luncheon. She is awaiting sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   Gore insisted that he did not learn that the luncheon was used
to raise money until several months after it had occurred. In
between, he said in numerous interviews with the press that he
understood the luncheon was a ``community outreach event.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no solicitation of money,'' Gore said. ``I did not
see any money or checks change hands. I never heard it discussed.
Nor do I believe it took place, incidentally.''
</P>
<P>
   He told Conrad, ``Perhaps you know that some money changed hands
there. But to this day, I don't think any did.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday at the Justice Department, Reno acknowledged that
prosecutors had embarked on a renewed investigation of Gore's
statements under oath about his political fund-raising practices
during the 1996 presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at her weekly news conference, Reno said that she would
ignore the inflamed partisan passions surrounding the election year
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing in any investigation, particularly in
this time of year, is that we conduct an investigation the right
way, not in the headlines, not with pressure from people who may
have differing views but just do it right _ methodically,
carefully, without commenting on it _ and get it done as quickly as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats sought to shift the spotlight to the background and
possible motives of Conrad, the head of the Justice Department's
campaign finance task force who made the special counsel
recommendation late last week.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1996, while working as a federal prosecutor in
Charlotte, N.C., Conrad contributed $250 to Sen. Jesse Helms,
R-N.C., Federal Election Commission reports show. Democrats said
the contribution raised questions about his political motives in
his inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews Friday, several senior Justice Department
officials defended Conrad's impartiality and said there was no
basis to believe that his legal judgments were politically
motivated.

GONZALEZ HAS QUESTIONS. DO YANKS HAVE ANSWERS? 
</HEADLINE>
   By JACK CURRY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ One of Juan Gonzalez's agents stressed Friday that his
client had not exercised his no-trade clause, and that he still had
an interest in playing for the New York Yankees. That kept alive
the possibility that Gonzalez could soon be acquired from the
Detroit Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got an open mind about going to the Yankees,'' Fernando
Cuzza, the agent, said. ``He's got an open mind about talking to
the Yankees.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuzza and the Yankees had brief discussions Friday about what it
would take to persuade Gonzalez to join the two-time defending
world champions. The Yankees and the Tigers on Thursday agreed to a
deal in principle that would have sent outfielder Ricky Ledee, the
top prospect and third baseman Drew Henson and the Class AA
left-handed pitcher Randy Keisler to Detroit for Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Cuzza said the main reason he contacted a member of the Yankees'
hierarchy was to clarify Gonzalez's position and refute reports
that said Gonzalez had invoked his right to veto the trade. The
Yankees have a 72-hour window that ends at noon Sunday to try to
agree to terms with Gonzalez. Both sides could petition the
commissioner's office to extend the window, and the request would
almost certainly be granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that we wanted to get across to the Yankees
today was that those rumors reported about Juan vetoing the trade
were not true,'' Cuzza said.
</P>
<P>
   But there could still be a stumbling block, because Cuzza and
another friend of Gonzalez's said the slugging right fielder would
probably not be interested in signing a long-term deal. It seemed
doubtful the Yankees would give up three young players to rent
Gonzalez for the last three months of the season. Gonzalez agreed
to leave Texas and play this season for the Tigers, but he turned
down Detroit's long-term deal _ eight years and $140 million _
after he was obtained from the Rangers. The Yankees, whose
suggestion of a one-year extension to Gonzalez was not accepted,
would probably have to offer close to $140 million. Apparently,
Gonzalez would still be reluctant to sign such a lengthy extension
without having played a day as a Yankee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Juan is more likely to want to play the rest of the year out
and see how the chemistry is and how things are,'' Cuzza said. ``I
think once he goes there, he'll feel like he wants to stay and work
something out.''
</P>
<P>
   Another friend of Gonzalez's, who has spoken with him and who
insisted on anonymity, added, ``He'll waive his trade veto and he
won't ask for anything to waive it, but he doesn't want a contract
extension.''
</P>
<P>
   Do the Yankees want the 30-year-old Gonzalez desperately enough
to give up three players without guarantees that they will have him
beyond the 2000 season? It seems unlikely. But the Yankees could
try to include lesser prospects in the trade, they could hope
Gonzalez comes to the Bronx and falls in love with the team, or
they could decide that adding the two-time American League Most
Valuable Player to their needy offense is worth the current price,
even if it is only for the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't make sense with him not wanting to leave Detroit,''
Paul O'Neill said. ``Does it? I don't see how that makes sense.''
</P>
<P>
   The uncertainty about whether Gonzalez would be joining the
Yankees filled the visiting clubhouse before the Yankees played the
White Sox Friday night. Bernie Williams, who played in youth
baseball leagues with Gonzalez in Puerto Rico when they were 15
years old, said he would gladly call Gonzalez and talk to him about
the positive aspects of New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the team wants me to talk to him, I'll be willing to do
it,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Torre refused to discuss the Gonzalez situation, other than
admitting that he met with Ledee and told him to ignore the trade
speculation, because the manager would be the first one to tell him
if he were traded. Other than a slump in the second half of the
1996 season and the drama of the postseason, Torre called the
spectacle created by the Gonzalez and Sammy Sosa rumors ``the
toughest distraction we've had to deal with.'' The Cubs have asked
the Yankees for at least five of their elite prospects for Sosa,
and those discussions have not advanced.
</P>
<P>
   Ledee has been distracted. Orlando Hernandez rushed up to Ledee
in an animated fashion and asked him why he was still with the
team. Ledee smiled, but he is so worried and had such a bad
headache that he took five pain relievers before the game. Still,
Ledee knows his future is probably tied to Gonzalez's decision, and
he is honest about what could happen by Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got money, he's got MVPs, he's got everything you could
want,'' Ledee said. ``He said he wants to win. Why wouldn't he come
here?''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said Gonzalez has often been booed as an opposing
player at Yankee Stadium. Williams added that Gonzalez was quiet,
emotional and private, and that did not always translate well in
New York, where the attention and the expectations are intense. But
Williams looked around the clubhouse at a core of players who have
won three of the last four World Series and wondered if Gonzalez
could see exactly what he saw.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just can't see him passing up this opportunity with where he
could be and where he's playing now,'' Williams said. ``Nothing
against Detroit, but he's got a chance to win if he comes here.
He's won all the individual awards. If he goes on and plays his
whole career and doesn't win, he'll think about this.''

APPEALS COURT CLEARS WAY FOR ELIAN TO RETURN TO CUBA 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Clarifies 4th graf by breaking it into 3 sentences.)  
 By RICK BRAGG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ A federal appeals court in Atlanta has refused to
reconsider the case of Elian Gonzalez, leaving the U.S. Supreme
Court as a last hope for the Miami relatives who want to prevent
his return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the nation's highest court intervenes, a step considered
unlikely, the 6-year-old and his father, who have been living in
Maryland and later in Washington while the legal appeals play out,
would be free to leave the United States and return to Cuba after 4
p.m. Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The 12 members of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals not
only denied the Miami relatives' request for a re-hearing Friday,
but they did not even call for a vote on the question.
</P>
<P>
   The relatives' lawyers, Judge J.L. Edmondson wrote in the
unanimous opinion, should direct any requests for a further stay of
the deadline to the Supreme Court. He said his court would not
grant any future motions for a stay. He wrote the ``NOT'' in bold,
oversized letters.
</P>
<P>
   Approval from seven of the 12 members of that court was needed
for a re-hearing of the case, in which a three-judge panel had
ruled June 1 in favor of the government and, indirectly, Elian's
father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the nine Supreme Court justices must agree to hear an
appeal, but a single justice can grant a stay, or refer the
question about a stay to the full court.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy is the Supreme Court member assigned
to hear emergency cases like this one. If he does not act on a
stay, the father could legally put his son a plane for Cuba as
early as 4:01 p.m. Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for the Miami relatives, Spencer Eig, said the
relatives here will appeal, and seek a stay of that deadline. ``We
feel the future of a small boy is important enough to take to the
highest court,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But legal experts say that a stay seems unlikely, and that a
friendly ruling for the Miami relatives is, if the case is heard,
even more unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a pack-your-bags decision,'' said Pamela Falk, a
professor of international law at the City University of New York
who has argued similar cases before. ``The legal issues are over.
The family has exhausted every remedy. They had their day in court.
They had many days.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, where Elian has been living with his father,
step-mother, half-brother and a delegation of friends and teachers
from Cuba, a lawyer for Juan Miguel Gonzalez said the family has
not decided when they would leave the country if the stay actually
does expire.
</P>
<P>
   The Gonzalez family, said Gregory B. Craig, their lawyer,
``looks forward to resuming a normal life.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno, who has been criticized for her
handling of the case, said she was ``pleased that the 11th Circuit
Court of Appeals has acted unanimously in denying the motion for
re-hearing. Now that the court has conclusively upheld our
decision, I am hopeful that this father and son will soon be able
to move on with their lives together.''
</P>
<P>
   In their appeal, lawyers for Lazaro Gonzalez, the boy's Miami
great uncle, had argued that the three-judge panel was wrong to
uphold an Immigration and Naturalization Service decision to return
Elian to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The three-judge panel had found that, while the court might
disagree with sending the boy back to a Communist government with a
long, dismal history on human rights, the law gave wide discretion
to the immigration agency in such cases and that the powers of the
executive branch of government should be respected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since this case does not present a complicated legal issue,
there is no reason to expect the Supreme Court to take interest in
this appeal,'' said David Abraham, a professor of immigration law
at the University of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, where Lazaro Gonzalez kept the boy in his home after
he was rescued at sea in November and until the armed federal raid
reunited him with his father in April, people were disappointed,
but there were no demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the house where Elian had lived, which has become a
shrine of sorts in the exile community, only a few people showed up
to voice their displeasure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel it's a case that is appropriate for the Supreme
Court,'' said Eig, the lawyer for the Miami relatives. He said the
relatives' lawyers will argue that Elian has constitution rights to
apply for asylum.
</P>
<P>
   But the Supreme Court is more likely to affirm Juan Miguel
Gonzalez's rights in the case, said Falk. ``It is so highly
unlikely that the Supreme Court will grant even an emergency
injunction.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian has been at the middle of an international custody battle
since he was found floating on an inner tube off the coast of
Florida on Thanksgiving Day. He was one of three survivors of a
failed crossing from Cuba that drowned his mother and 10 others.

GORE IS STILL RAISING FUNDS AS INQUIRY CONTINUES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Inserts new graf that begins ``In the transcript ...'' Since
this graf now contains the first reference to Clinton, there is a

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Within hours of ordering his lawyers to release the
transcript of his interview during the investigation into his 1996
fund-raising activities, Vice President Al Gore was back to
business as usual on Friday _ trolling for money.
</P>
<P>
   In an affluent Silicon Valley neighborhood, Gore raised $500,000
over lunch. In Denver on Thursday, Gore headlined two events that
raised a total of $1.1 million. On Friday, after the Silicon Valley
lunch, he attended a gala dinner on the San Francisco waterfront
where the singers David Crosby and Steven Stills serenaded several
hundred people.
</P>
<P>
   Then came a reception at a private home. The day's total take:
$2 million. On Saturday he was scheduled to attend a fund-raiser in
Miami that was expected to bring his three-day total to over $3.5
million.
</P>
<P>
   The fund-raising events were broken up by the news on Thursday
that, based on an April 18 deposition of Gore, a Justice Department
official was asking Attorney General Janet Reno for an
investigation into the vice president's money-raising activities in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night Gore advisers read the transcripts of the
deposition and on Friday they released copies to news
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns about Gore's overzealous money-raising, coming in the
midst of a fund-raising swing, put an especially fine point on what
Gore likes to call the ``irony'' of his situation.
</P>
<P>
   Here is how Gore _ who has tried to deflect criticism of his
links to the fund-raising problems by calling himself ``an
imperfect messenger'' for overhauling the campaign finance system _
dealt with this uncomfortable topic at lunch on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In a sun-splashed dining room, where paintings by Miro and
Chagall decorated the stucco walls, he talked confidently about the
nation's powerhouse economy, borrowing a line from Ronald Reagan:
Did Americans feel they were better off today than they were eight
years ago?
</P>
<P>
   There was a soft murmur of assent. And then, perhaps in a nod to
the issue that had dominated Friday's news reports, Gore briefly
made a pitch for tossing out the entire campaign finance system
that has caused him so much grief.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an irony to talk about this issue at a fund-raising
event, I realize,'' Gore told the dozen or so people who had paid
$25,000 each to lunch on grilled salmon and vegetables. ``But the
first bill I will present to Congress will be the McCain-Feingold
campaign finance bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has struggled mightily over the last two weeks to focus
attention on the upside of the Clinton administration _ the
unprecedented economic expansion and his ideas for using the
nation's growing budget surplus to improve education, health care
and the environment. This forms the basis of his ``prosperity and
progress tour'' and the underpinning of his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   But he is being pulled away from sketching out a rosy future to
explaining the past. And in doing so, he is being pulled inexorably
into the downside of the administration _ not just the questionable
fund raising of 1996 but the specter of the next president spending
his time being questioned under oath about whether he has told the
truth.
</P>
<P>
   In the transcript released Friday, Gore gives a startlingly
similar answer to the now-infamous answer given by President
Clinton as he quibbled over the meaning of the word ``is.'' When
Gore was asked what role the coffees would play in raising money,
he said: ``Let me define the term `raising.''' He added, ``If you
mean by it, would they be events at which money was raised, the
answer is no.''
</P>
<P>
   For the last year, Gore has been working furiously to separate
himself from an administration that has been accused repeatedly of
not telling the truth, even as his opponent, Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas, has offered himself as an alternative. And Bush clearly
hoped that the call for an investigation into Gore's truthfulness
would signal to voters that a Gore administration would not be much
different from Clinton's.
</P>
<P>
   ``If America is tired of scandals and investigations, let's
elect somebody different, other than the people of the Clinton/Gore
administration,'' Bush said in Alabama on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the Gore campaign was employing a durable Clinton
tactic made familiar during the Monica Lewinsky investigation _
pre-emptively releasing hundreds of pages of documents in an effort
to defuse the controversy and dispatch it quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and his advisers moved in an uncharacteristically
aggressive fashion to dispel any suggestion of wrongdoing and,
using another Clinton tactic, implied that the re-emergence of the
issue was, if not a vast right-wing conspiracy, at least an
orchestrated smear by the Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president hinted broadly that Thursday's leak of the
request for an investigation was politically motivated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the timing of this whole thing speaks for itself,''
Gore told reporters as he announced that his campaign was releasing
the transcripts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have told the truth,'' he added. ``I have cooperated fully.
And I don't want people to have the impression that I am trying to
hide something. I am not. I want you to see it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Fabiani, a spokesman for Gore and a veteran of the Clinton
White House damage-control operation, said that the release of
documents was the best way for the Gore campaign to fight what he
described as ``Republican dirty tricks.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Fabiani said that the Republicans, through Sen. Arlen Specter,
R-Pa., had leaked the information because ``Bush was having a bad
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Fabiani noted that the governor had been presiding over an
execution and pointed to reports that Bush's financial ties to the
oil industry would render him useless in the battle against high
gas prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the Republicans tried to do yesterday was to kick up dust
and say, `No one really knows what the issue is, but it's an issue,
it's significant and it comes out of this April 18 deposition,'''
Fabiani said. ``Those of us who read through the deposition last
night couldn't find a single such issue that was compelling, and
the quickest way to challenge that was to release it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rachel Gorlin, a Democratic consultant, said the Gore campaign
was probably smart to release the transcripts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Clinton lesson is to show that it's worth it to engage in
the discussion, partly because the public doesn't care that much
and partly because this gives Gore standing'' to make his case and
challenge the Republicans, Gorlin said. ``The thinking is, let's
take the hit now and move on, that they won't find anything they
can use in the fall, and by then it will be old news anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   She also said that the possible investigation illustrated the
age-old problem for vice presidents seeking to become president:
``Is this election about what's gone on during the previous
administration or is it about what he can do in the future?''
</P>
<P>
   Allies of Gore saw another possible advantage in releasing the
transcripts. Although Gore uses the word ``hell,'' apparently
reinforcing reports that he was angry and confrontational during
the deposition, Fabiani suggested that this showed passion, a
quality that he has been accused of lacking.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for the Bush campaign and for Specter said that there
was no collusion between them.

NEW EVIDENCE IN A FUND-RAISING INQUIRY 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES RISEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A former official of the Central Intelligence
Agency has provided fresh evidence to support accusations that a
top Democratic Party official sought to enlist the agency to aid a
major donor to President Clinton's 1996 re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In a new unpublished manuscript, the former official _
identified during congressional investigations into Democratic
fund-raising abuses only as ``Bob from the CIA'' _ describes a
telephone conversation he said he had with Donald Fowler, then the
chairman of the Democratic National Committee. Fowler was seeking
the agency's help for Roger Tamraz, a Lebanese-American
entrepreneur who had contributed at least $300,000 to the
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Accusations that Fowler sought to use the CIA on behalf of
Tamraz rocked the agency in early 1997 when they surfaced in the
midst of the confirmation hearings in the bid by the national
security adviser, Anthony Lake, to become director of central
intelligence. Lake withdrew his nomination as soon as the
accusations of Democratic efforts to politicize the agency emerged.
Later that year, Tamraz became a star witness in the congressional
investigation into Democratic campaign fund raising.
</P>
<P>
   Fowler also testified, telling a Senate committee investigating
the campaign finance scandal that he could not recall ever talking
to a CIA officer in order to help Tamraz.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Bob from the CIA'' never testified publicly about the
matter. At the time, he was still undercover as an officer in the
Directorate of Operations, the agency's clandestine espionage arm,
and even his last name remained classified. He gave a deposition to
Senate investigators and left the agency not long after the Tamraz
affair.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in his book-length manuscript, he writes that Fowler wanted
him to help Tamraz overcome resistance by White House staffers who
were trying to prevent Tamraz from meeting with President Clinton.
Tamraz wanted support from the Clinton administration for his plan
to build an oil pipeline in the Caspian Sea region.
</P>
<P>
   Tamraz had previously had a secret relationship with the agency,
and when he ran into resistance from officials at the National
Security Council at the White House, he told Fowler that the agency
might be able to pry open the White House doors so he could meet
with President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore. Tamraz gave
Fowler ``Bob's'' name, since he was then a senior manager in the
agency's Central Eurasian Division.
</P>
<P>
   But Fowler insisted in his congressional testimony that he could
not recall ever having called the agency on Tamraz's behalf. The
notes also made it clear that Fowler understood Bob's CIA
affiliation, according to the Senate campaign finance committee's
report on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very sensitive to the implications of perjury statutes,''
Fowler told the Senate campaign finance committee in 1997. ``But I
have in the middle of the night, at high noon, late in the
afternoon, early in the morning _ at every hour of the day for
months now searched my memory about conversations with the CIA, and
I have no memory _ no memory of any conversations with the CIA.''
</P>
<P>
   Fowler, who served as chairman of the Democratic National
Committee in 1995 and 1996, said again in an interview Friday that
he could not recall any conversations with an agency official on
Tamraz's behalf. ``I've been through that a hundred times, and I
just have no memory of any of that,'' said Fowler. ``I have made
multiple statements about that, and don't have anything else to say
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the new manuscript, Bob writes that on Oct. 18, 1995, Tamraz
called him at his office at the agency. ``A fellow named Don Fowler
is going to call you,'' he (Tamraz) said. ``Please talk to him.'''
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Bob writes, he did not know who Don Fowler was.
So he took Fowler's number from Tamraz, and called him to see who
he was and what was going on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fowler called back the next day _ October 19th, and identified
himself as the chairman of the Democratic National Committee,'' the
manuscript says. ``I never identified myself as a CIA employee, and
Fowler never referred to my CIA employment, but it was nevertheless
obvious that he knew exactly who I was. He told me he was trying to
help his good friend Roger Tamraz. He told me straight out that he
was upset with'' two National Security Council officials ``because
they were blocking Tamraz's access to the president, and they were
doing it for the benefit of major corporations like Amoco. He said
that Roger had been disinvited to a White House fund-raising event,
and so Roger had complained to Fowler. I guessed Roger had given
the DNC chairman my name as someone from CIA who could vouch for
him.''
</P>
<P>
   In its final report on its investigation into campaign fund
raising, the Senate committee said that ``it is likely'' that
Fowler's claims that he couldn't recall his contact with Bob were
false.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA has blocked publication of the manuscript, arguing that
it contains too much classified material about agency operations.
Since the author submitted the manuscript to be cleared in
December, the agency's Publications Review Board has repeatedly
demanded numerous changes, despite a requirement that the review
process be completed in 30 days. Current and former CIA officials
are required by law to seek agency clearance for books or articles
they publish to ensure that they don't divulge classified
information.
</P>
<P>
   Bob said he now believes that the agency's demands have been so
excessive that the book can't be published in its current form.
</P>
<P>
   The author and his Washington attorney, Victoria Toensing, have
appealed the decisions of the review board to the agency's
executive director. In the meantime, HarperCollins, the New York
publisher, has canceled its contract to publish the book.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were legal issues relating to the publication of the
book, and Harper Collins decided not to go forward,'' said Lisa
Herling, a spokeswoman for Harper Collins.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Disputes between the agency and Bob and his attorney over the
manuscript have intensified in recent days, after security
personnel demanded to retrieve copies of a letter Toensing had
written to the agency's executive director relating to the
manuscript. An agency spokesman said the incident was prompted by
the fact that the CIA believed the letter contained classified
information, and Toensing had sent the letter to the agency over an
unclassified fax machine. However, Toensing said in an interview
Friday that she had been using the same fax to communicate with the
agency on matters related to the book for months.
</P>
<P>
   A CIA security official called Toensing's office and talked to
her son, Brady Toensing, who is also a lawyer, since Victoria
Toensing was traveling at the time. The security officer said she
wanted to search the law office's files and computer hard drives
for classified information, according to Brady Toensing. He said he
denied the request. On June 15, two CIA security personnel arrived
at Victoria Toensing's law offices. Brady Toensing said he gave
them the letter, and assured them he had erased copies of the
letter from the office computers. The security personnel left
without renewing their request to search the office or his mother's
computers, Brady Toensing said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Harlow, a spokesman for the agency, denied that the
security personnel had ever asked to search the computer hard
drives in Victoria Toensing's offices.
</P>
<P>
   Another CIA spokesman, Mark Mansfield, insists that the agency's
objections to the manuscript are not politically motivated or a
result of the author's disclosures concerning Democratic fund
raising. Instead, the agency is only opposed to his use of
operational details. The agency said that Bob's case marks only the
fourth time in the last five years that a current or former agency
official has appealed decisions by the publications board.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost invariably, the publications review board process is
collegial and involves negotiation,'' said Mansfield. The board
``works to ensure that classified information is not divulged,
while at the same time not interfering with an author's right to
tell his or her story. Our very legitimate concern is that the
written product not contain classified information.''
</P>
<P>
   Victoria Toensing responded by saying that the agency has sought
to prevent the book's publication by claiming that material like
the Tamraz affair, and another incident concerning a prostitute, is
classified. ``We have complied with the rules of the prepublication
process,'' she said in an interview. ``However, the CIA has made
false claims of classified information to thwart publication of
this book. We have told them time and again we don't want to
divulge information about clandestine operations. This is not what
we are arguing about.''
</P>
<P>
   After the author left the agency in late 1997, he was awarded a
Career Intelligence Medal for his actions during his clandestine
espionage career. He wrote his book without identifying his last
name at the request of the agency.

A PURITAN JUDGE'S ANTI-SLAVERY VOICE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)   By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Judge Samuel Sewall, a prominent and pious Bostonian of
Puritan times, is remembered for much these days, it is for the
literary and historical value of the diaries he kept, and his
repentance for his role in the Salem witchcraft trials.
</P>
<P>
   Sewall served on a court appointed by the governor of
Massachusetts in 1692 to examine the witchcraft accusations in
Salem. Alone among the judges, he later apologized publicly, with a
statement read aloud in his church, the Old South Meeting House.
</P>
<P>
   But today, Sewall might better be remembered for another
declaration. June 24 happens to be the 300th anniversary of the
printing of a remarkable pamphlet he wrote, offering religious
arguments against slavery, which was then legal in Massachusetts.
It was one of the earliest anti-slavery declarations made on
American soil, arguing a cause that few people would join until
much later, on the eve of the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   Sewall titled his pamphlet ``The Selling of Joseph: A
Memorial,'' a reference to the story in the 37th chapter of Genesis
in which Jacob's sons sell their brother Joseph into slavery in
Egypt. The document begins, ``Forasmuch as liberty is in real value
next unto life: none ought to part with it themselves, or deprive
others of it, but upon most mature consideration.''
</P>
<P>
   Sewall went on to say, ``It is most certain that all men, as
they are sons of Adam, are coheirs; and have equal right unto
liberty, and all other comforts of life.'' He also wrote that
slavery was not a natural condition for human beings.
</P>
<P>
   When he wrote the pamphlet, Sewall was almost 50 and was serving
on Massachusetts' highest court; he would become its chief justice
in 1718.
</P>
<P>
   (His pamphlet was not the first anti-slavery declaration in the
Colonies. Mennonites in Germantown, Pa., published a short but
strong anti-slavery statement in 1688.)
</P>
<P>
   The current pastor of Old South Church, which is now 333 years
old, is the Rev. James W. Crawford, who preached a sermon about
Sewall a few years ago titled ``The Last Puritan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was an amazing man,'' Crawford said in an interview. ``Not
only as a justice but as a great reader, a great writer. He was on
the board of overseers at Harvard College. He was quite an
intellectual.''
</P>
<P>
   Crawford said he regarded Sewall, in his apology for serving on
the witchcraft court and in his anti-slavery pamphlet, as acting
very much in the tradition of Old South, where Benjamin Franklin
was baptized and the Revolutionary patriot Samuel Adams served as a
deacon.
</P>
<P>
   The church, he said, was founded as ``a progressive institution,
doing its best to disengage from the rigid Calvinist fundamentalism
of the first generation'' of Puritans. Old South, he said, ``always
has been in the forefront of recognizing social change and trying
to interpret the Gospel to deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   The church now is part of the United Church of Christ, a
Protestant denomination that traces its roots to the Puritans and
the Congregationalists who came after them.
</P>
<P>
   The denomination's president, the Rev. John Thomas, said
Sewall's pamphlet would be included in a seven-volume series of
theological documents related to the denomination's history, to be
published later this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really a lovely reminder of the historical roots that we
often ignore,'' Thomas said, ``that really nourish many of the
contemporary involvements of the United Church.''
</P>
<P>
   But Thomas also acknowledged that ``there were many New England
Congregationalists that participated in the slave trade in one way
or another, so our story is never a pure one.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And,'' Thomas said, ``Sewall in his own life embodied that
ambiguity _ as a participant in the Salem trial, in a sense
representing the worst of what we have been, and then writing this
tract, and representing the best of what we have been.''
</P>
<P>
   The diaries kept by Sewall, who died in 1730, have long been
public documents. His entry for June 19, 1700, contains the
notation that he had been ``much dissatisfied with the trade of
fetching Negros from Guinea,'' and had had ``a strong inclination
to write something about it.''
</P>
<P>
   After reading a contemporary commentary on the apostle Paul's
letter to the Ephesians, Sewall wrote that day, ``I began to be
uneasy that I had so long neglected doing anything.'' He concluded
by saying he hoped that he ``was call'd of God to write'' the
pamphlet and that a divine blessing would accompany it.

IT COULD BE A GOOD DRAFT FOR KINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Kings' trade for Zigmund Palffy and Bryan
Smolinski certainly can't be, and shouldn't, be second guessed. The
two forwards helped Los Angeles crawl from the depths of the
Western Conference to fifth place and a rare spot in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit swept the Kings in the first round, but there is reason
to believe the prospects for the immediate future are bright.
</P>
<P>
   Palffy and Smolinski, however, didn't come cheaply. The Kings
sent three recent top draft choices (Olli Jokinen, Josh Green,
Mathieu Biron) to the New York Islanders and pretty much wiped out
any depth there might have been in the farm system.
</P>
<P>
   ``That trade pretty much cleaned out our young players, but
there aren't any regrets in the organization,'' said Al Murray,
Kings director of scouting. ``We made tremendous strides (last
season).''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Murray and the rest of Kings management know there is a
big job ahead, and that job begins today at the 2000 NHL Entry
Draft in Calgary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of needs to address in this draft,'' said
Murray, who knows the Kings must address those needs thoughtfully
if they don't want a repeat of the playoff drought that followed
the departure of Wayne Gretzky and a host of other aging veterans
in the years following the Kings' run to the Stanley Cup finals in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings are well stocked in goal. Los Angeles has Stephane
Fiset and Jaime Storr on the NHL level and has a number of quality
prospects in the minors. But the Kings are short on center and wing
prospects, especially since they were unable to sign 1998
second-round pick, center Justin Papineau who has re-entered the
draft.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles' three top minor league forwards are Pavel Rosa, who
has yet to prove he can play on the NHL level, the often injured
Eric Belanger, and Scott Barney, who recently had back surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings select 20th in the first round and have at least one
pick in seven of the nine rounds. Los Angeles currently has no
fourth or sixth-round picks, but it has three in the fifth and two
in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   However, draft picks don't automatically turn into prospects,
especially in NHL drafts, where GM's and scouts are trying predict
the potential of 17 and 18-year old youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I compare it to going into a high school classroom and picking
out who will be a doctor or a lawyer,'' said Murray. ``You don't
know who is going to be able to make the adjustment to the NHL.
Some kids figure out how to work hard and make it and some maybe
change because of the money.''
</P>
<P>
   This year's draft seems tailor made for the Kings' needs even
though it's not deep, and is lacking in quality prospects on
defense. The strength of the draft is at wing.
</P>
<P>
   Hotshots Danny Heatley and Marian Gaborik will be long gone by
the time Los Angeles picks, but the Kings still should have a
number of decent wingers to pick from.
</P>
<P>
   Russian wingers Alexander Frolov, Alexei Smirnov, Alexei Mikhnov
and Nikita Alexeev are among those could be available, along with
Canadian junior standout Justin Williams. Centers that might still
be up for grabs late in the first round include Jarret Stoll and
Marcel Hossa, brother of Ottawa standout Marian Hossa.
</P>
<P>
   If Los Angeles opts to look at defensive prospects, Swedish
defenseman Lars Jonsson, American Ron Hainsey and 209-pound Russian
Anton Volchenkov are possibilities.

KINGS KNOW IMPORTANCE OF GOALIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Having two top-notch goaltenders isn't merely a
luxury the Los Angeles Kings desire. Management realizes it's a
necessity in today's NHL, especially when one looks at the recent
medical history of Stephane Fiset and Jaime Storr.
</P>
<P>
   Both goalies have suffered serious injuries in each of the past
two seasons, and twice they have been sidelined at the same time.
With that in mind, the Kings have opted to protect both Fiset and
Storr in today's NHL Expansion Draft in Calgary.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles officials were so intent on shielding their two top
goalies that general manager Dave Taylor traded a draft choice to
Chicago for Steve Passmore, a goalie who had played at least 10 NHL
games last season and could be made available to Minnesota and
Columbus. Taylor has even had talks with both the Wild and Blue
Jackets about one of them selecting Passmore so the Kings wouldn't
lose a defenseman.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Kings opted to protect two goalies, they could protect
only three defensemen. Rob Blake and Mattias Norstrom were
no-brainers, while the promising but inconsistent Aki Berg was the
other defenseman protected. First-year NHL pro Jere Karalahti did
not have to be protected.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves veteran Sean O'Donnell very much exposed, along with
free agent Garry Galley, Jaroslav Modry and Philippe Boucher.
Neither expansion team is likely to select a free agent, but they
very well could be interested in a strong stay-at-home defenseman
like O'Donnell. His loss would leave a big hole in a relatively
thin Los Angeles defense.
</P>
<P>
   Among the forwards not protected, winger Craig Johnson is the
most likely to be chosen. The speedy Johnson, who scored nine goals
and 23 points while playing a checking role last season, grew up in
Minnesota and played three years at the University of Minnesota.
The ties would seem to make him a perfect fit in the Wild's scheme
of things.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I wasn't going to be protected,'' said Johnson, who was
acquired by the Kings in the 1996 trade that sent Wayne Gretzky to
St. Louis. ``I would like to stay with the Kings, but if I'm
(chosen by) the Wild, then it happens and I'll make the best of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Veteran winger Nelson Emerson is also unprotected, but he is 32
years old and his $2 million salary isn't something either
Minnesota or Columbus would be that interested in picking up.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings protected seven forwards: Luc Robitaille, Zigmund
Palffy, Jozef Stumpel, Glen Murray, Bryan Smolinski, Ian Laperriere
and Kelly Buchberger.
</P>
<P>
   According to draft guidelines, all teams except Nashville and
Atlanta will lose two players, but no more than one goalie or
defenseman. A team that loses a goaltender can't lose a defenseman.

DUCKS FACING HARD FACTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As the Anaheim Mighty Ducks head into their eighth
NHL Entry Draft, the cold, hard facts are that Anaheim is 43 games
under .500 in its first seven years, and has qualified for the
playoffs just twice.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks defeated Phoenix in 1997, but have lost eight straight
playoff games to Detroit since beating the Coyotes in their
first-round series.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, across the country in Florida, the Panthers, who like
the Ducks joined the NHL in the 1993-94 season, are one game over
.500 and have advanced to playoffs three times, including a
stunning run to the 1996 Stanley Cup Finals.
</P>
<P>
   So what have the Ducks done wrong?
</P>
<P>
   For the most part nothing. Anaheim management from the beginning
insisted it was going to build a solid foundation through the
draft. And for the most part the Ducks have done just that,
starting with the selection of Paul Kariya in the 1993 draft.
</P>
<P>
   Four of Anaheim's first-round draft choices are currently on the
roster Kariya, Oleg Tverdovsky, Ruslan Salei and Vitaly Vishnevski.
Another, Chad Kilger, was used as trade bait, along with
Tverdovsky, in the deal that brought Teemu Selanne to Southern
California. Ducks general manager Pierre Gauthier then used last
year's No. 1 pick to bring Tverdovsky back.
</P>
<P>
   Other current Ducks acquired in the draft include second-line
center Matt Cullen, regular defensemen Pavel Trnka and Niclas
Havelid, and forwards Mike Leclerc and Antti Aalto. Anaheim also
has high hopes for youngsters Maxim Balmochnykh, Mikael Holmqvist
and Jordan Leopold, even though they might not make their mark for
several years.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim's draft performance certainly hasn't been perfect
second- and third-round picks like Nikolai Tsulygin, Valeri Karpov
(1993); Johan Davidsson, Craig Reichert (1994); and Brian Wesenberg
(1995) didn't pan out.
</P>
<P>
   But the Ducks' draft record certainly compares favorably with
Florida's, especially when you consider they stole top-line center
Steve Rucchin in the 1994 Supplemental Draft.
</P>
<P>
   But that being said, the question remains, why is Florida 44
games up on the Ducks in the win-loss column?
</P>
<P>
   The simplistic and popular answer is that Disney has been
unwilling to spend money on the team; that it hasn't gone out and
signed any big-name free agents.
</P>
<P>
   That sounds logical to some, but upon closer inspection that's
just critics taking the easy way out. The Ducks spend over $15
million a year in the checks they hand out to Kariya, Selanne and
Guy Hebert, and Anaheim certainly isn't the only team not signing
aging players to what Gauthier calls ``retirement contracts.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York Rangers spent millions on unrestricted free agents
last season and they didn't come close to making the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Brett Hull is one of the only successful free agent signings in
recent seasons and he went to a Dallas team that was already in the
league's upper echelon, thanks to its shrewd drafts and trades.
</P>
<P>
   One vocal critic of the Ducks insists that they have already
done the hard part acquiring superstars Kariya and Selanne and that
they simply need to fill out the supporting cast.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds easy, but it's not. This isn't basketball where two
players can turn a team into champion like the Lakers. Hockey is a
true 20-man sport, and teams need time to acquire the depth
necessary for a run at the Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Where the Ducks' development did bog down was after their 1997
playoff run, when former GM Jack Ferreira and former team president
Tony Tavares clashed with coach Ron Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson was let go and the Ducks floundered under the ill-suited
Pierre Page, who never had a chance thanks to Kariya's lengthy
holdout and season-ending concussion.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps that wasted year will turn out to be a blessing in
disguise. Ferreira was demoted and Tavares turned over control of
the hockey operations to Gauthier and gave up his title as
president.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks failed to make the playoffs last season, but the depth
is improving and there is reason for optimism. Given time, it's
hard to believe Gauthier won't turn them into a consistent winner.

DUCKS GM HASN'T CHANGED PHILOSOPHY ON BUILDING TEAM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Pierre Gauthier knows that failing to make the
playoffs is unacceptable, especially in a winner's market like
Southern California. But the Mighty Ducks' general manager insists
he hasn't changed his philosophy about building a team, even though
he traded Anaheim's first-round pick on draft day last year, and
recently dealt away his second-round selection in Saturday's NHL
Entry Draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we will be going to the podium (to announce a draft
choice),'' said Gauthier, realizing that deals like the one in
which he acquired Oleg Tverdosvky (from Phoenix in exchange for
Travis Green and the 15th overall pick) don't drop in a GM's lap
every draft day. Tverdosvky, after all, is a 23-year old all-star
caliber defenseman and figures to be a fixture at the Pond for
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should never say never based on last year,'' said
Gauthier, who would love to acquire a power forward with a scoring
touch. ``But I'd never trade for an older player for a short-term
fix. We can obtain players other ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Gauthier, who traded this year's second-round pick for promising
goalie Jean-Sebastian Giguere, is a firm believer in building
through the draft. As Quebec's chief scout and Ottawa's GM, he saw
first-hand how good drafts can turn around franchises. He also
points to Detroit and New Jersey as teams that built their
rock-solid foundations through the drafts.
</P>
<P>
   ``All good clubs are built through the draft,'' he said. ``It's
all about stockpiling assets.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks are scheduled to draft 12th in the first round. They
have one third-rounder, two fourths, three selections in the fifth
and one each in the sixth and seventh rounds.
</P>
<P>
   This year's draft is not considered particularly deep,
especially on defense, and Gauthier feels there are only one or two
players who might make an impact next season. The majority of those
drafted figure to be long-term projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of these kids won't play (on the NHL level) for three of
four years,'' he said, knowing just how tough it is to project the
futures of 17- and 18-year-old youngsters. ``But if you don't draft
well, five years comes and goes very quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Gauthier has had success drafting European players in the past,
and he feels this year's draft has a distinct European quality to
it.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the players that might be available when it's the Ducks'
turn to draft figure to be European, including Russian wingers
Alexei Smirnov, Alexander Frolov and Nikita Alexeev; speedy Swedish
forward Martin Sameulsson; two-way Czech center Vaclav Nedorost;
211-pound Russian defensemen Ilya Nikulin; and Lars Jonsson, a
offensively gifted Swedish defenseman.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Gauthier has improved the Ducks' depth on defense
and in goal, leading many to believe that Anaheim will stockpile
forwards, their greatest need at the moment. But Gauthier insists
he can't, and won't, draft for need.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows, we might draft seven defensemen...we are looking
for players,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And one never knows what round those players might be found on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people say it looks like a crap shoot, but some shoot
crap better than others,'' he said of finding quality players in
the later rounds of the draft.

POLLS PUT LEADING CANDIDATES IN MEXICO IN DEAD HEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   By SAM DILLON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Public opinion surveys show the two leading
presidential candidates in a virtual tie before the election on
July 2, with as many as one-fourth of the voters undecided.
</P>
<P>
   Three polls show Francisco Labastida Ochoa, the governing party
candidate, leading by a slender margin. A fourth survey showed
Vicente Fox Quesada, of the center-right National Action Party,
slightly ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The half dozen polls were released on Wednesday and Thursday
because publication of polling information is prohibited from
midnight Friday until 8 p.m. on Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   The polls show that the race, in which Labastida enjoyed an
overwhelming advantage over Fox, has continued to narrow. And they
have intensified the extraordinary uncertainty and public tension
about the outcome of an election that has become a plebiscite on
whether the Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI,
should continue to govern Mexico after 71 years in power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either candidate, Labastida or Fox, could win this election,''
Alejandro Moreno, the chief pollster at the Mexico City newspaper
Reforma, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In the nationwide survey published Thursday in Reforma,
Labastida was favored by 34 percent of voters, Fox by 32 percent,
and Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano, a leftist candidate, by 13
percent. Three percent of those surveyed said they would vote for
minor candidates or for no candidate, and 19 percent of voters said
they were still undecided or refused to respond to pollsters'
questions. The margin of sampling error was plus or minus 3
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Another nationwide poll, commissioned by Reuters and carried out
by Zogby International, a New York research firm, showed Labastida
to be supported by 31 percent of voters, Fox by 29 percent and
Cardenas by 10 percent. The margin of error was plus or minus 3
percent. About 3 percent of those surveyed said that they supported
minor candidates, and 27 percent said they were undecided or
declined to respond, said John Zogby, president of Zogby
International, in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   In a third survey, also announced on Thursday, conducted by
Grupo de Economistas Asociados, a private Mexico City research
firm, Fox was supported by 32 percent of those surveyed, Labastida
by 31 percent and Cardenas by 15 percent. Twenty percent were
undecided. Two percent supported minor candidates. The margin of
error was plus or minus 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really a tie,'' Mauricio Gonzalez Gomez, the research
organization's director, said in a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   The polling reports provoked an immediate debate about how to
interpret the high numbers of voters who refused to express a
commitment for any candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts argued that the undecided voters, whose numbers
ranged from 18 percent to 27 percent depending on the survey,
represented the percentages of eligible voters who are unlikely to
cast ballots.
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts say the high percentage of uncommitted voters
reflects the high level of political fear in the electorate after a
campaign that has been extraordinarily bitter. Complaints have been
heard across Mexico that officials of the government and the PRI
have threatened that voters would lose access to government welfare
and farm programs if Fox wins. As a result, some analysts have said
that many of the people expressing indecision in the surveys are
merely reluctant to acknowledge their intentions to vote for the
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Most surveys taken before Mexico's last presidential elections,
in 1994, predicted that the PRI would earn 2 percent to 3 percent
more votes than the party eventually received at the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the new surveys showed that when voters were asked to
leave aside their own preferences and to say whom they expected to
win the election, significantly more Mexicans believed that
Labastida would win.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1994 elections, the PRI won votes from many Mexicans by
portraying itself as the party that could offer stability in a
dangerous world. This year, as Fox has campaigned as the candidate
of change, Labastida has again been playing on voters' fears, and a
survey published on Wednesday by a private consulting group,
Consultores y Marketing Politico, suggested that the tactic could
be effective.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to choose between social peace and having a new party take
over power, nearly eight in 10 voters said that they preferred
stability.

HE REBUILT THE LAKERS, BUT WEST MAY QUIT 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For 12 years, Jerry West worked to rebuild the Los Angeles
Lakers into a championship team. He cleared enough space beneath
the salary cap to acquire the game's most dominant center, shrewdly
maneuvered a draft-day deal to sign a prodigy out of high school
and, to top it all off, helped woo the league's most successful
coach.
</P>
<P>
   But just four days after Shaquille O'Neal, Kobe Bryant and Phil
Jackson led the Lakers to their first NBA title since 1988, West
admitted Friday that he was uncertain of his future with the
organization.
</P>
<P>
   A league executive said Friday that West would soon resign as
the Lakers' executive vice president for basketball operations.
When reached in his Los Angeles office Friday, West did not refute
the notion that he would leave the Lakers during the off-season.
Although he said that his retirement was not imminent, the
62-year-old West also declined to say that he would be around to
watch the team he assembled defend its title.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea what I'm going to do,'' West said. ``When
you've been in this business for a long time, I think we all get to
the point sometime where we think, `Why do I need this?' But I
certainly felt that way the last two years and I haven't done
anything, so I don't know what I'm going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   West, an executive in the Lakers' front office since 1982, has
entertained the idea of retiring before, most recently after the
1997-98 season. He now has a three-year, $10.5 million contract
extension that runs through the 2002-03 season, but he said that
that would not necessarily stop him from retiring this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told everyone, until our season's over, and our season's not
over, I've got work to do,'' West said. ``I'm supposed to be here
until September. Because I have a contract doesn't make any
difference. I don't have to hold them to that, and they don't have
to hold me to it, either.''
</P>
<P>
   A person close to West said he could envision West leaving the
Lakers in mid- to late July. ``Now that he's won, I think he
actually might do it,'' the person said. ``The problem is, he's
said it before. I won't believe it until it actually happens.''
</P>
<P>
   It would seem like a strange time for West to step away. After
12 years of trying to return Showtime to Los Angeles, he has done
so with a bang, building a team around O'Neal and Bryant that could
become a dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   But according to two league executives and another person with
knowledge of the Lakers' situation, West is bothered by his
decreased role since Jackson arrived. They said Jackson had usurped
much of West's decision-making power, angering West and prompting
him to consider resigning.
</P>
<P>
   West, however, denied having any problems with Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's absolutely ludicrous,'' West said. ``For me, he's been
like a breath of fresh air. He's been absolutely great to work
with.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been no secret, however, that West and Jackson have
clashed over the role of Glen Rice in the Lakers' game plan.
Believing that Rice's outside shooting ability would make him the
perfect complement to O'Neal and Bryant, West traded Elden Campbell
and the All-Star guard Eddie Jones for Rice and two others last
season. But Rice, with his limited defense and inability to create
his own shot, has not fit well into Jackson's triangle offense and
has butted heads with the coach. As a result, Rice almost certainly
will not be in a Lakers uniform next season.

Slay goes to the mat for Texas
<TEXT>
<P>
   Olympic berth might boost state wrestling
</P>
<P>
   By DANNY ROBBINS
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   DALLAS _ One way or another, Brandon Slay's life is about to
change.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on how things go today, he will be a member of the
U.S. Olympic wrestling team _ the first Texan in that position _ or
he finally will enter the work force with the rest of the
University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business Class of
'98. Go to Sydney or go to the office. No pressure there.
</P>
<P>
   Slay's quest will be front and center among the do-or-die
stories when the U.S. team is determined today. Wrestlers who won
their weight classes at the national championships in April will be
paired against those who won their classes in the Olympic challenge
tournament, which was played out Thursday and Friday.
</P>
<P>
   As the freestyle national champion in the 167-pound class, Slay
was assured a spot in the finals, where the winner will be
determined through a best-of-three series of matches. Today, he
faces the task of beating Brian Dolph, a former NCAA champion at
Indiana who is now an assistant coach at Penn. Dolph upset ex-Iowa
wrestler Joe Williams in the challenge tournament final to earn a
shot against Slay.
</P>
<P>
   As badly as Slay wants a place on the Olympic team for the
obvious reasons, the Amarillo native knows what his spot on the
team would mean to those who care about wrestling in Texas. He
would be more than Texas' first Olympic wrestler. He would be the
state's first standard-bearer in the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something that's driving me as well,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wrestling is a hugely popular sport at the high school and
college levels in Iowa, Oklahoma and other states, but it is
basically an afterthought in Texas, relegated to the ``club sport''
level by the state's universities and colleges.
</P>
<P>
   Wrestling is an NCAA sport at only five schools in the Big 12
Conference _ Oklahoma, Oklahoma State, Iowa State, Nebraska and
Missouri _ and is not likely to surface anywhere else. When schools
deal with the gender equity concerns mandated by Title IX,
wrestling is often the first program to go.
</P>
<P>
   With Slay among the primary competitors and with the event being
staged at Reunion Arena in Dallas _ a city literally going to the
mat to hype its 2012 Olympic bid _ the trials have caused an
uncharacteristic buzz for wrestling in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Wrestling officials believe the trials can reinforce the
legitimacy the sport received when it was placed under the umbrella
of the University Interscholastic League two years ago. About
one-fifth of Texas' 1,232 public high schools had boys or girls
wrestling teams during the 1999-2000 school year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that basically there's no college wrestling in the
state, but that will hopefully come if you build a base, and the
base to me is starting to be a factor,'' said Dan Gable, the
legendary former Iowa wrestling coach and one of the freestyle
coaches for the U.S. Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   Among those attending Friday's freestyle session was Bryan High
School coach Mike Zito, four of his wrestlers in tow. Zito said
Slay's presence at the trials should significantly impact all high
school wrestlers in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``By him being here, it just gives these kids something to
attach themselves to,'' said Zito, a Texas A&AMP;M graduate who
wrestled in high school in Ohio. ``Our best guys might be
undefeated in Texas. Then we go up to Oklahoma (to compete) and
they get killed. In Brandon Slay, they can see that a little work
paid off.''
</P>
<P>
   Young wrestlers in Bryan-College Station have been exposed to
Greco-Roman heavyweight Matt Ghaffari, who won the Olympic silver
medal in 1996 and two years ago started a camp with Zito.
</P>
<P>
   Ghaffari finished second to Rulon Gardner at the 2000 nationals
but worked his way through the challenge tournament to earn another
shot at Gardner today. Win or lose, Ghaffari, 38, will be in Bryan
on Monday to begin a weeklong visit to the camp.
</P>
<P>
   Slay hopes his success will allow him to organize a major
wrestling club in Amarillo and spur at least one Texas college to
start an NCAA-level program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in equal rights,'' he said, referring to the Title
IX-related pressure on school administrators. ``But you see schools
starting women's crew with women who have never been in a boat. You
see them give $25,000 to those programs and cutting others. I don't
understand it.''
</P>
<P>
   Slay, 24, lost only one match during his wrestling career at
Amarillo's Tascosa High School _ pre-UIL _ and also was an
all-district nose guard in football. His route to becoming one of
wrestling's elite meant leaving the state for the University of
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Recruited by some of the more traditional wrestling schools,
Slay chose Penn because of its academics. Facing the financial
consequences of attending an Ivy League school that does not offer
athletic scholarships, he said he has $25,000 in student loans to
repay.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father and I talked about that when I was being
recruited,'' he said. ``He said, `All these schools want to give
you a scholarship and you want to go to a place that costs $30,000
a year? Why?' I said, `Because 30 years from now, you'll be happy I
graduated from the Wharton School of Business.'''
</P>
<P>
   Slay earned his degree in 1998 and twice reached the finals of
the NCAA championships, losing as a senior in '98 to Iowa's
Williams. According to the Amarillo Globe-News, only one other
Texas wrestler _ Bobby Johnson, an Amarillo native who competed for
Oklahoma State in the 1950s _ has appeared in the finals at the
NCAAs.
</P>
<P>
   For the last two years, Slay has lived and trained at the U.S.
Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs. Working with freestyle
coach Kevin Jackson, a 1992 Olympic gold medalist, he has improved
significantly, reaching the point where he was able to beat
Williams at the nationals.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has raised the bar,'' said Greg Strobel, who will be one of
the U.S. Olympic freestyle wrestling coaches. ``I saw Joe Williams
at the world championships and didn't think anybody would challenge
him this year. I was a little surprised when Brandon beat him at
nationals, but Brandon is in the driver's seat.''
</P>
<P>
   Slay's pairing with Dolph, an assistant at Penn since 1993,
offers the added subplot of student vs. mentor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't teach him all my tricks,'' Dolph, 33, said. ``but I
showed him a lot. It's kind of weird. But, at the same time, you
always have a couple tricks up your sleeve.''
</P>
<P>
   Slay will be joined today at Reunion by a large contingent of
family, friends and current and former coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Section 104,'' he said, pointing to a section in the lower
portion of the arena and indicating his group might fill it.
</P>
<P>
   For those seeking to climb aboard the bandwagon, the Texas
chapter of USA Wrestling has been selling ``Slay 'Em Brandon''
T-shirts ($10 apiece) outside the arena since Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   There is, of course, the possibility Brandon will be the slayed.
It is a possibility he doesn't want to think about, but one he
seems capable of handling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see myself sticking around and training for 2004,'' he
said. ``If I win, great. If something freak happens and I lose,
I'll deal with it. There are other things I can do.''

LOS ANGELES OKS $4 MILLION TO BAIL OUT DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL
CONVENTION 
</HEADLINE>
   By TODD S. PURDUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ By a one-vote majority, the Los Angeles City
Council Friday approved $4 million to bail out the host committee
for the Democratic National Convention here, assuring enough cash
to begin building the stage at the Staples Center next month and
avoiding a political embarrassment for Mayor Richard Riordan.
</P>
<P>
   But Riordan's victory came at a personal price: $1 million, to
be exact.
</P>
<P>
   That is because the Council required that several $1
million-dollar letters of credit held by the Democratic National
Committee from a group of wealthy civic leaders backing the
convention must be cashed before any of the new city money is
spent. One of those letters has Riordan's signature.
</P>
<P>
   In an even more bitter twist, the bailout could not muster a
majority from the 15-member Council's 12 Democrats, and Riordan, a
Republican who helped to lure the convention in the first place,
had to rely on a liberal Democrat, Jackie Goldberg, a frequent
antagonist in a Council full of them, to pass it.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg, who represents Hollywood, called the vote the hardest
of her career and agreed to support the grant only after the
Council accepted her amendments on the letters of credit, as well
as a requirement that Pershing Square in the heart of downtown Los
Angeles be available for public protests.
</P>
<P>
   Civil liberties groups have criticized a plan to limit protests
to a fenced-off area set aside near the Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg's amendments also required the police Department to
meet with an ad hoc Council committee before and during the
convention to avoid any police overreaction to protests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jackie made it really clear she would vote no,'' said her
chief of staff, Sharon Delugach, who expressed surprise that the
council member's conditions had been met, especially those
involving the police and protesters. From the beginning, the
convention has been dogged by fund-raising difficulties, chiefly
because the organizers agreed to finance the $35 million cost
almost entirely from private funds, as did organizers of the 1984
Olympics here.
</P>
<P>
   The city originally agreed to provide transportation and
security services amounting to about $7 million, but estimates of
those costs have risen and earlier this week the Council approved
$2 million more.
</P>
<P>
   But it balked at a request for an additional $4 million to
jump-start construction work, with members insisting that would
violate their original promise to taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   However, the measure passed on Friday 8-5, the bare majority
needed in the 15-member body. Two members were absent.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Austin, a spokesman for the host committee, said the group
was ``thankful that the Council expanded its partnership,'' and
said the investment would help reap $135 million in economic
activity for the city.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the troubles, the host group has raised a record amount
in private cash and services, $25 million, and said they're hopeful
a Sunday fund-raiser at Riordan's house, featuring President
Clinton, will raise more than $1 million toward about $3 million in
cash that is still needed.

NO MECHANICAL PROBLEMS WITH KENNEDY'S PLANE, SAFETY OFFICIALS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Investigators at the National Transportation Safety
Board writing a report about the plane crash that killed John F.
Kennedy Jr. and two others last summer have not found a mechanical
problem, but a conclusion hasn't been reached, according to the
agency.
</P>
<P>
   Because it was a private plane, Kennedy's Piper Saratoga did not
carry a flight data recorder or a cockpit voice recorder, depriving
investigators of detailed information.
</P>
<P>
   In the crash of private planes, investigators look for engine
failure, structural failure or other mechanical or electrical
problems. If they fail to find any, they usually give a ``probable
cause'' that stems from some failure by the pilot specific to the
accident, like not flying high enough to clear the trees, or
failure to maintain sufficient airspeed to keep the plane aloft.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Kennedy, whose plane went down on a hazy night on
its way from New York to Martha's Vineyard, the suspicion by NTSB
officials is a loss of orientation.
</P>
<P>
   The crash killed not only Kennedy, 38, who was at the controls
of his single-engine plane, but also his wife, Carolyn Bessette
Kennedy, 33, and her sister, Lauren Bessette, 34.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Lopatkiewicz, a spokesman for the safety board, said Friday
that although a preliminary report had been sent to the board's
headquarters here from its regional office in Parsippany, N.J., the
report was not final and did not reach a conclusion. That, he said,
was for headquarters staff or the board itself.
</P>
<P>
   The five-member transportation board votes on statements of
probable cause on nearly all airline accidents, but votes only on
about two dozen of the roughly 2,000 general aviation crashes each
year. For the others, a senior staff member signs the report.
</P>
<P>
   Lopatkiewicz said that a report would probably be published next
month, but that the board had not decided whether it would vote on
the findings.

TRADING TO START EARLY IN SHARES OF DIVIDED KC SOUTHERN
INDUSTRIES 
</HEADLINE>
 SOUTHERN-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 BY MARK DAVIS, KNIGHT RIDDER NEWSPAPERS   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wall Street plans to start trading shares from next month's
breakup of Kansas City Southern Industries Inc. as early as Monday,
the financial services and transportation company said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City Southern plans to spin off its financial services
companies, including the Janus mutual fund family, on July 12. The
breakup will create a new company called Stilwell Financial and
leave Kansas City Southern with its railway.
</P>
<P>
   The company plans to distribute Stilwell shares to owners of
Kansas City Southern shares as of June 28.
</P>
<P>
   But three separate stocks are expected to begin trading next
week on the New York Stock Exchange, Kansas City Southern's
announcement said.
</P>
<P>
   One stock will represent ownership of the as yet unborn
Stilwell. The Stilwell shares will begin trading next week on a
``when-issued'' basis under the symbol SV.
</P>
<P>
   Another of the three stocks will represent ownership of the
continuing combined company that exists today. Those shares will
trade under the symbol KSU and will trade with ``due bill
attached,'' which entitles the owner to both the Stilwell shares
when they are spun off and shares of the remaining railway company.
</P>
<P>
   The third of the three stocks will represent ownership of the
soon-to-be-stand-alone railway company. These shares also will
trade on a ``when- issued'' basis, under the symbol KSU-WI.
</P>
<P>
   The railway shares will represent ownership after a planned
1-for-2 reverse stock split by the railway company. Investors will
end up with half the number of shares but with the same total value
because the new share price will double to reflect the reverse
split. The move will keep the share price above $5, the price
needed for investors to buy shares on credit.
</P>
<P>
   On July 13, when the breakup actually happens, regular trading
will begin in Stilwell shares and shares of the stand-alone railway
company. The railway company will be called Kansas City Southern
but will have new certificates and a new identification on Wall
Street.

<P>
   GORE SAYS HE'S HIS OWN MAN
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore is not running for a third Clinton term,
or so he told Barbara Walters in an interview that ran Friday night
on the ABC News program ``20/20.'' Asked what President Clinton's
role in his presidential campaign would be, Gore said, ``It's not a
Clinton third term.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the notion that Gore ``flip-flops'' on various matters,
including abortion and gun control, Gore said: ``Don't you want
somebody who learns from experience? I mean, I have. And I think
that if you, if you don't learn from experience, you're really not
paying attention.'' Asked for his strengths and weaknesses, he said
that his strength was ``working hard, having my heart in the right
place'' and that his weakness was ``sometimes I turn too much to my
head'' in thinking through problems rather than allowing himself
``to feel the emotional dimension.''

   THE CONVENTIONS
</P>
<P>
   GOP LAUNCHES MORE WEB SITES
</P>
<P>
   Several new Web sites allow voters to participate in the
Republican convention from home. One such site,
www.gopconvention.com, allows people to register as ``dot-com
delegates'' and participate in the convention through online
``floor passes'' and streaming video of convention proceedings.
Another site, www.2000gop.com, has an interactive electoral college
as well as Internet polling: ``Can Bush win? Click here to
decide!'' At www.votedaq.com, arm-chair political activists can bet
on their favorites through a virtual stock market made up of
political candidates. Each candidate is turned into a stock and
voters can buy and sell shares _ candidates' prices rise and fall
along with their political fate. Who's hot? Ralph Nader, the Green
Party nominee for president. His shares rose 16.24 percent this
week in heavy trading.

<P>
   PHILADELPHIA RESTRICTS MASKED PROTESTS
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to prevent violent protests at the Republican National
Convention, the Philadelphia City Council has passed an ordinance
that prohibits the wearing of a mask with the intent to commit a
crime. The measure was approved Thursday and imposes fines of $75
to $300. The Philadelphia Police Department had lobbied for the
ordinance, saying it would help control the demonstrations expected
during the convention, scheduled from July 31 to Aug. 3. Deputy
Police Commissioner Robert Mitchell said some protesters wore masks
while damaging businesses during the World Trade Organization talks
in Seattle last fall. Opponents had argued that it would be
impossible for the police to determine the intent of those wearing
masks. The sponsor of the bill, Councilman Rick Mariano, said it
would not affect Philadelphia's annual Mummers Parade on New Year's
Day, which features thousands of masked musicians.

<P>
   PENNSYLVANIA ELECTION DISPUTED
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic candidate in a closely watched legislative
election on Tuesday in Pennsylvania is claiming victory. But
Republicans are calling for an investigation, saying voter fraud
may have occurred. Control of the state's House of Representatives
was the dominant issue in the contest because the Legislature will
begin redrawing state and federal election districts next year.
Going into the election to fill a vacant Scranton-area seat,
Republicans held a 101-99 edge in the Pennsylvania House, and both
parties had sent in their big guns to help their candidates. Vice
President Al Gore campaigned for the Democrat, Jim Wansacz, and
President Clinton did some broadcast ads for him; Gov. Tom Ridge
came in to help the Republican, Tom Parry. In the final vote tally,
Wansacz beat Parry, 8,569 to 7,619.

JOHN ROBINSON INVESTIGATORS IDENTIFY ANOTHER BODY AS SHEILA DALE
FAITH  
</HEADLINE>
 BC- BODIES-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 BY TANYANIKA SAMUELS, DIANE CARROLL KNIGHT RIDDER NEWSPAPERS   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Reversing an earlier statement, the task
force investigating John Edward Robinson Sr. on Friday announced
that one of the bodies found in a Raymore storage locker was that
of Sheila Dale Faith.
</P>
<P>
   Faith, of Pueblo, Colo., was identified after the Jackson County
medical examiner's office took a new look at dental X-rays, Cass
County Prosecutor Chris Koster said.
</P>
<P>
   Faith and her daughter, Debbie Lynn Faith, disappeared in the
summer of 1994. Forensic experts are still working to determine
whether the last unidentified body is that of Debbie Faith.
</P>
<P>
   That ``is certainly a distinct possibility,'' Koster said. He
said he expected to have a definitive answer early next week.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement Friday came a week after the task force asked
the public for help finding the Faiths.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, 56, of Olathe, Kan., has been charged in the murders
of five women found in barrels: three in Raymore, including Sheila
Faith, and two in Linn County, Kan. He also has been linked to the
disappearances of three women and a baby in the 1980s. He is being
held in the Johnson County Jail on a $5 million bond.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives who were notified by authorities Friday morning were
trying to cope with the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sickening,'' said Sheila Faith's brother, William Howell
of Chandler, Texas. ``I hate to lose a family member, especially
under circumstances like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Howell said he couldn't help but wonder how his sister died.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was it brutal, was it not?'' he said. ``It's just saddening,
that's all I can say.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier tests, which included comparing old dental records and
X-rays, seemed to indicate that Sheila Faith was not one of the
unidentified bodies.
</P>
<P>
   But lingering doubts by members of the two-state task force
investigating the case prompted Jackson County medical examiners to
take another look.
</P>
<P>
   Koster said Faith had had extensive dental work done since 1981,
including numerous extractions. So the old dental records did not
match up with X-rays of the body.
</P>
<P>
   But on Thursday, the Jackson County medical examiner's office
took additional X-rays, examining the roots of each tooth, and made
a positive identification, Koster said.
</P>
<P>
   Koster earlier had said that Michael Finnegan, a forensic
anthropologist from Kansas State University, was going to help
investigators identify the two bodies. In light of Friday's
announcement, Koster said he might still seek Finnegan's help in
pinning down how long ago the women were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Sheila Faith was one of five children, her brother said. They
grew up in Dallas. Their father died about a half-dozen years ago,
he said, around the same time an older brother with a kidney
problem died. Their mother is in a nursing home, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Howell, a year younger than Faith, said his two other sisters
did not want to comment on her death.
</P>
<P>
   He said his parents divorced when he was 4 or 5 years old. His
mother and the children went to live with the mother's mother, he
said. Their mother then left them, he said, and when she returned,
the grandmother would not let her have the children back.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of a court battle over who should have the
children, the grandmother's house burned down, he said. The boys
went to a boys home and the girls to a home for girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our family has never been super close,'' Howell said.
</P>
<P>
   Sheila and Debbie Faith lived in Southern California and moved
to Northern California after Sheila's husband died.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, they moved to Pueblo, Colo., where Sheila Faith met a
man named ``John'' through a newspaper ad. He invited them to join
him in Kansas, friends said. At the time, Sheila Faith was 45 and
Debbie Faith was 16.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, the Faiths vanished from the neighborhood. Their mail _
including government aid checks _ was forwarded to a mail center in
Olathe, where it was picked up by Robinson, according to the
center's owner.
</P>
<P>
   Howell said he had not been in touch with Sheila Faith for
years. He and his family have tried periodically to find her, he
said, but never succeeded. Sheila Faith often did not have a
telephone, he said, which made it harder to stay in contact.
</P>
<P>
   The family can't afford much, he said, but they want to give
Sheila Faith a proper burial. He said they might wait to make plans
until after they learn for sure whether the last unidentified body
is Debbie Faith.
</P>
<P>
   Manuel Guerrero, a friend of the Faiths in Pueblo, said he
couldn't get the pictures of the barrels he had seen on television
out of his mind. He first saw the footage of the barrels from the
Raymore storage locker while visiting relatives in Illinois, before
the Faiths were connected to the Robinson investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had (the barrels) taped up on the top with plastic,''
Guerrero said. ``I didn't know what was in them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was them, I guess,'' he said, referring to both Faiths,
even though only Sheila Faith has been identified.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty gruesome.''

N.Y. LEGISLATURE VOTES TO INFORM PUBLIC OF DOCTORS' HISTORIES 
</HEADLINE>
   By JENNIFER STEINHAUER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Legislature voted Friday to notify the public about
malpractice judgments and disciplinary actions against doctors
practicing in New York state. The information would be posted on
the Internet and would be available through a toll-free telephone
number.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, which Gov. George Pataki said he was studying,
would put New York among a handful of states that give consumers
extensive information about the practice histories of doctors and
the quality of hospitals. The state already provides a Web site
listing the names of doctors it has taken disciplinary action
against, but it contains much less information than the new law
would require. Also, few New Yorkers know about the site, health
care policy experts say.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would require the Department of Health to post on its
Web site everything from the mundane _ doctors' education, hospital
affiliations and professional awards _ to the damning: malpractice
history and hospital dismissals that stemmed from harm to patients.
The measure would also require the state health commissioner to
develop a notice to be posted in hospital and doctors' offices
alerting patients to the site, and to an 800 number that they could
also call to get the listings.
</P>
<P>
   The malpractice notification bill had been foundering in the
Senate earlier this year, but it gained momentum late in the
session after several charges of egregious negligence were brought
by the state against doctors and hospitals. It was further
bolstered by an order to all 50 states by President Clinton to
improve the reporting of medical errors. The president's decree
followed a report that 44,000 to 98,000 hospital patients a year
die because of medical mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, known as the health information and quality
improvement bill, would also require the state to develop other
quality-assurance measures for the public, such as regularly
published hospital report cards and data about the outcomes of
various procedures, like the state's current statistics on heart
surgery survival rates. ``In the end, we will have the most
extensive information among the states that consumers can use,''
said state Sen. Kemp Hannon, the Health Committee chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Other states with aggressive reporting laws include
Massachusetts, which was the Assembly's model for its bill, and
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   It is still unclear whether Pataki will sign the bill, for which
he has voiced measured support all year. At a news conference
Friday, he said he was not familiar enough with the details of the
bill to make a commitment.

PETS AT WORK MAY CATCH ON

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ At offices across the nation, it was a dog's life
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   There was rawhide to be chewed, plenty of floor to sniff at, and
a few spots around the office to be marked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pee happens,'' said West Los Angeles psychologist Judy
Bin-Nun, who organized dog-day activities for her entire
professional building and dressed in a dog costume for the
occasion.
</P>
<P>
   Friday was officially the second annual Take Your Dog to Work
Day, an event started last year by Pet Sitters International and
promoted heavily by online retailer Pets.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're vying for top honors,'' said Bin-Nun, whose husband
works in the same building. ``We've got the rudest dog contest,
most beautiful eyes, best fur.''
</P>
<P>
   Her 13-year-old Brussels griffon, Max, might be a shoo-in for
rudest dog. While awaiting the festivities, Max decided to relieve
himself on the floor of the office.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the occasional obvious drawbacks, pets at work can be a
boon to employee morale and productivity, said Pets.com President
Chris Deyo.
</P>
<P>
   ``When dogs come to the workplace, it actually has some
significant benefits. It becomes a more productive work
environment,'' Deyo said. ``People tend to stay at work longer,
because they don't have to rush home so the dog can go to the
bathroom.''
</P>
<P>
   At Pets.com, every day is take-your-dog-to-work day, Deyo said.
</P>
<P>
   The company finds that the practice makes its employees happy,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some proven studies about animals reducing stress,''
Deyo said. ``Also, it's like an icebreaker to a certain extent.
People who work in different departments end up interacting.''
</P>
<P>
   Having dogs around is a fairly regular occurrence at Santa
Monica Studios, said employee Cynthia Rickerd, who brought her
yellow Labrador retriever, Dakota, to work Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you're around them and you see how loyal and loving they
are, everybody just warms up,'' Rickerd said. ``People come up to
your animal, and before you know it, you're just talking.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the goals for Pets.com is to try to get other companies
to adopt pets-allowed policies. Of course, there is the potential
business upside for the company, Deyo admitted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not being able to take your dog to work is a barrier to pet
ownership,'' he said. And the more pet owners there are, the more
potential Pets.com customers.
</P>
<P>
   The event has attracted acceptance in some high-profile circles.
Former presidential candidate Bob Dole, now in private law
practice, brought his dog to work Friday.
</P>
<P>
   More than 3,000 companies have requested an information packet
on Take Your Dog to Work Day from Pets.com, Deyo said.

DISPUTED ESTATE WORTH $2.5 MILLION INVOLVES SPOUSE WHO UNDERWENT
SEX-CHANGE SURGERY 
</HEADLINE>
 DISPUTE-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 BY JOHN T. DAUNER KNIGHT RIDDER NEWSPAPERS   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Longtime Leavenworth, Kan., resident Marshall
G. Gardiner was an impulsive person, according to his only son. And
now, about a year after his death, family members and others who
were close to him still are bobbing in the wake of that
impulsiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Late in 1998, when he was 86, Gardiner, a former journalist,
politician and stockbroker, among other things, married 40-year-old
J'Noel Ball, an assistant professor of finance at Park University.
</P>
<P>
   But when he died in August 1999, Gardiner left no will, an
estate of about $2.5 million and a question for the courts: Can a
man who has undergone a sex change _ J'Noel _ be a legal spouse in
Kansas?
</P>
<P>
   Had he left a will, Gardiner could have specified how his estate
was to be divided. Without a will, state law rules.
</P>
<P>
   After Gardiner's death, J'Noel Gardiner filed a claim for half
the estate as Gardiner's surviving spouse. J'Noel cited the
sex-change surgery in 1994 and offered as proof a Wisconsin birth
certificate ordered by a Wisconsin court.
</P>
<P>
   But Joe Gardiner, Gardiner's only child from a previous
marriage, and his attorney argue that J'Noel remains a man under
Kansas law and that the marriage is void.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Gardiner's position is that J'Noel is entitled to nothing.
</P>
<P>
   In January, a Leavenworth County probate judge ruled in favor of
Joe Gardiner, saying that J'Noel was not entitled to a spousal
share of the estate. J'Noel has taken the case to the Kansas Court
of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, no state recognizes marriage between people of the
same sex. Next month, Vermont will become the first state to
recognize ``civil unions'' between couples of the same sex.
</P>
<P>
   Gardiner married J'Noel on Sept. 25, 1998, in Oskaloosa, Kan.
Kansas Supreme Court Justice Robert E. Davis, an old friend of
Gardiner's, performed the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Gardiner said he didn't even know of his father's plan to
marry until after the marriage had taken place and that he didn't
meet J'Noel until J'Noel picked up him and his wife, Joy, at the
airport the day after Marshall Gardiner died.
</P>
<P>
   Gardiner, 50, a Web page designer, and his wife moved to
Leavenworth from Georgia immediately after his father's death to
press the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father was an impulsive person,'' Joe Gardiner said. ``He
didn't consult friends or seek legal advice before he made
decisions that changed his life forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Marshall Gardiner, a combat veteran of World War II, maintained
a high profile in Leavenworth. He served two terms in the Kansas
House in the late 1950s and after an unsuccessful run for Congress
in the early 1960s, he became a stockbroker, where he made most of
his money.
</P>
<P>
   He made no secret of his wealth, either, driving around
Leavenworth for years with a license plate inscribed 1000000,
presumably for the first $1 million he made.
</P>
<P>
   He was a philanthropist, and one institution that benefited from
his largess was Park University. Both Marshall Gardiner and his
first wife, Molly Gardiner, who died in 1984, were Park graduates.
</P>
<P>
   It was at Park, a few months before their marriage, that he met
J'Noel, who had begun teaching there in the fall of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Before the wedding, Marshall Gardiner bought a house in his name
in Parkville, and J'Noel lived there and paid virtually all
expenses related to it. Gardiner spent weekends there but
maintained his home in Leavenworth. J'Noel was never inside
Gardiner's Leavenworth home, court records say, before he died on
Aug. 12, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Court records show that J'Noel had been Jay Ball and had been
married to a woman, Sandra Parker, from 1988 to 1993. But the
records say that even during that relationship Ball felt he should
have been born a female. He believed that he was born with a
``birth defect,'' that is, having male genitalia.
</P>
<P>
   So, in 1994, while teaching finance at Northeastern University
in Boston, he decided on sex change surgery in Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ball's external male genitalia were removed,'' legal documents
say. ``No female sex organs were transplanted into Ball.''
</P>
<P>
   From that procedure, J'Noel emerged with a new birth
certificate, ordered by a Wisconsin court and issued Sept. 26,
1994, listing J'Noel's sex as female.
</P>
<P>
   Federico Gonzalez, an Overland Park, Kan., plastic surgeon, who
participated in sex change procedures when he practiced in
Massachusetts, said the procedure usually begins with a psychiatric
evaluation and involves a team of physicians of several
specialties.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, hormone therapy and breast implants are used to
change the appearance of the body, Gonzalez said. Through surgery,
a vagina is created where the penis and testicles were and the
urinary tract is connected. No ovaries or other female sex organs
are implanted.
</P>
<P>
   The person's genes remain what they were, he said. But based on
outward appearance, the person, ``even under pretty close
examination,'' will appear female.
</P>
<P>
   In his experience, Gonzalez said, persons who have undergone a
sex change procedure list their new gender on driver's licenses and
similar types of identification. He said he did not know about
obtaining a new birth certificate.
</P>
<P>
   David Watkins, a Kansas City lawyer who worked on Joe Gardiner's
case, said: ``To the best of my knowledge, no state's legislation
says that for purposes of marriage a person can change sex and
become a woman or vice versa. If you're born a man, you stay a man.
If you're born a woman, you stay a woman.''
</P>
<P>
   J'Noel testified in a deposition that Gardiner was told about
the sex-change surgery two months before they were married. But
that is not an issue in the litigation.
</P>
<P>
   J'Noel's attorney, Sanford P. Krigel of Kansas City, contends
that J'Noel has been ``declared to be legally female'' through the
order of the Wisconsin court directing that the birth certificate
be changed. The Kansas courts should give ``full faith and credit''
to the order of the Wisconsin court, Krigel argues.
</P>
<P>
   In siding with Joe Gardiner, Leavenworth County Probate Judge
Gunnar A. Sundby said: ``J'Noel Gardiner was born a male and
remains a male for purposes of marriage under Kansas law. The
marriage between Marshall G. Gardiner and J'Noel Gardiner is
void.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Gardiner said this week that he felt confident that he would
prevail on appeal. J'Noel, on the other hand, declined to discuss
the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a private lawsuit and nobody's business,'' J'Noel said.
``Why don't you go join the `Jerry Springer Show?' &UR; ''

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ On Monday, June 12, a storm swept through
Blue Mound, Ill., disrupting power supplies and forcing an oil
refinery to shut down. It was an event that would soon be felt by
the nation's motorists, especially in Midwestern cities such as
Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   New York traders, fearing the refinery shutdown would tighten
supplies even more, bid up the price of future deliveries of
gasoline. Prices for wholesale gasoline followed, and motorists
soon saw prices go up at the pump.
</P>
<P>
   Fears of a shortage, however, were overblown. The small
refinery, which produces only a fraction of the country's gasoline
supplies, restarted in a few days. And when that news broke the
following Monday, it helped bring down futures prices and wholesale
gas prices.
</P>
<P>
   Such wild short-term fluctuations show how tight stockpiles,
production and supply glitches, and market opportunists _ far more
than the price of crude oil _ have pushed up prices recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``These prices didn't reflect a shortage as much as the
perception that there might be a shortage,'' said Urvan Sternfels,
the president of the National Petrochemical &AMP; Refiners Association
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But there's more to the story. By Tuesday morning, prices for at
least some wholesale gas in the Kansas City area were beginning to
go down slightly. Even so, Texaco's company-owned stations in the
area had raised their prices about a dime a gallon, to $1.88 for
regular unleaded.
</P>
<P>
   It's that sort of price increase that raises suspicions among
motorists, especially in the Midwest where fuel prices are
traditionally among the lowest in the country. Recently, they've
been among the highest.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're price gouging us, and the reason they are is because
they can,'' said Kenneth Langley, a Kansas City motorist who said
he had done a lot of traveling recently.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission on Tuesday called the increases
``questionable'' and said it would launch a formal investigation
concentrating on the Milwaukee-Chicago corridor. Cost factors
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there's more afoot in the recent rise in gasoline
prices than the amount of oil that the Organization of the
Petroleum Exporting Countries is willing to sell and the cost of
the commodity.
</P>
<P>
   At its current cost of $33 a barrel, crude oil accounts for
about 79 cents of the price of a gallon of gasoline. Each $1 a
barrel of crude oil's price contributes about 2.4 cents to the
price of a gallon of gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   Another part of the cost of gasoline is federal and state taxes,
which total 39.4 cents per gallon in Kansas and 35.4 cents in
Missouri. The balance is refining and marketing costs, which have
claimed a bigger chunk of the price of gasoline in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of crude oil as a percentage of Kansas City gasoline
prices has fallen from 56 percent in January to 45 percent in June.
</P>
<P>
   Oil prices, of course, have had a big effect on gasoline costs.
But if only higher crude-oil costs were reflected in Kansas City
area fuel prices, then a gallon of unleaded gasoline that cost
$1.16 a gallon in January at area service stations would cost $1.30
a gallon today, instead of the $1.79 that was charged as recently
as Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   So what accounts for the rest of spiking prices? There's little
disagreement that the underlying problem stemmed from entering the
summer driving season with gasoline stockpiles that were too low.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1999, the country was awash in gasoline, and that had
depressed prices, according to Valero Energy Corp., the country's
largest independent refiner, in its financial report for the first
quarter of 2000. In fact, gasoline prices adjusted for inflation
had sunk to their second-lowest level in history.
</P>
<P>
   But a year later, according to Valero, stockpiles were at
historically low levels, which pushed prices up. Valero pointed to
reduced oil production from OPEC beginning in March 1999 and
refiners using less of their production capacity to make gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of a customary buildup in preparation for the summer
driving season removed a cushion and soon had consequences,
particularly in the Midwest, said David Costello, an economist for
the federal Energy Information Administration.

LAZIO'S SENATE CAMPAIGN TEMPO QUICKENING 
</HEADLINE>
   By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After spending five minutes at a press briefing
following a breakfast with business leaders at the Waldorf-Astoria
Friday, Rep. Rick Lazio bolted down 15 flights of stairs and into
an elevator, a gaggle of reporters in pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's aides scolded the handful of reporters who made it into
the elevator behind Lazio, the Republican Senate nominee for New
York, smiled wanly in the corner, tersely responding to a few more
questions before racing for his car out front. A Lazio staff member
said the congressman was heading back to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The spectacle provided a glimpse into Lazio's first tough week
since he won the nomination May 30. He has spent the week besieged:
by the news media, hungry for comment on an investigation into his
lucrative securities trading; by his opponent, Hillary Rodham
Clinton; and by gay rights advocates angered that he is skipping
the gay pride parade in Manhattan Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio has offered minimal public responses as he seeks to
conduct congressional and campaign business in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's campaign aides say that clearly they have seen better
days but they do not think the wave of press coverage and attacks
by Clinton _ in television advertisements and a news conference
Thursday at City Hall _ will make a strong impression on voters. As
they prepared for a campaign swing upstate during the next couple
of days, they spoke of polls showing the race about even and
Lazio's intention to strike at themes popular among voters, like
high gas prices he will attribute to the Clinton administration's
energy policies.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio plans to speak out on the matter even though Hillary
Clinton has criticized him for missing a vote last week in the
House that would have created a heating oil reserve, an idea he
championed months ago to lower heating bills. Lazio caught a plan
to New York for campaigning instead. He also missed a news
conference Thursday scheduled by House Republicans to call on
President Clinton to take action on high gasoline prices. His aides
said he was giving an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Although on the defensive, Lazio largely kept up an upbeat
demeanor Friday. After talking to the business leaders primarily
about education, advocating things like at least one charter school
for every district lagging academically, Lazio walked into a hotel
conference room to a crowd of two dozen reporters and stood in
front of a bouquet of microphones. He then answered questions about
a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation of his
short-term windfall three years ago from the securities of a
company controlled by campaign contributors.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I spoke to my wife last night about this,'' Lazio
said. ``I was a little concerned when I spoke to her about how it
would affect me. She's just terrific. She said, `Listen, you know
what? We're honest, decent people. I clean my own house. We work
hard. We have nothing to be ashamed of. They're trying to drag you
down into the mud; don't let them do it.' And I'm not going to let
them do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio seemed to struggle with standing tough while keeping his
vow not to sound too negative.
</P>
<P>
   But it did not stop him from obliquely swinging at Clinton.
Asked if he thought the investigation was politically motivated, as
Lazio himself said last week, he replied: ``I think it's fairly
transparent. I think the Clinton camp is going to answer for
itself. And I think the people of New York are going to judge her
behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a reminder that Clinton faced a dose of unfavorable news
herself this week, something Republican strategists said they
feared would be lost in the coverage of the investigation of Lazio.
New polls showed her tied with Lazio. And although Robert Ray, the
independent counsel investigating the Clintons, said he would not
charge Clinton for her involvement in the firing of seven longtime
White House employees in 1993, he suggested she was more involved
than she has acknowledged. The employees were replaced by the
Clintons' supporters and relatives from Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Observers said such rocky times _ whatever the genesis _ were
inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has never been a successful New York public leader who
did not have to go under the microscope and take the heat,'' said
Adam Goodman, a former media adviser to Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's
Senate campaign. ``Rick Lazio has had a couple of things that put
him in the hot seat, and I think he has done well.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ In early spring, the Explorer Pipeline Co.'s
line that runs from Tulsa, Okla., to St. Louis to Chicago had
problems and had to be shut down. That further hampered the buildup
of gasoline inventories in the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It turned out to be a very bad omen,'' said Costello.
</P>
<P>
   There were also some refinery outages. But compounding the
problem was a change in the formula for cleaner-burning
reformulated gas, which such cities as St. Louis and Chicago had to
start using June 1.
</P>
<P>
   There are differing views on the new formula's effect on
stockpiles. But the difficulty appeared to stem from production
problems in using ethanol, a cleaner-burning fuel made from corn,
in the Midwest to meet the stricter environmental standard.
Preoccupation with that problem appears to have affected the
production of conventional gasoline used in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   As Memorial Day approached, gasoline stockpiles in the Midwest
were nearly 20 percent below a year ago. Compounding the problem:
Motorists were in no mood to conserve, with gasoline consumption
expected to grow 3 percent compared with last summer.
</P>
<P>
   The simple solution to higher prices will be replenishing
gasoline inventories, which is unlikely this summer, Costello said.
</P>
<P>
   Stockpiles may be the underlying reason. But other factors may
also be in play, particularly when trying to explain the wild price
swings of recent weeks. The Mid-Continent wholesale gasoline market
priced regular unleaded gasoline at $1 a gallon June 6. That
climbed to $1.23 on June 15 and by June 21 had returned to $1.05,
according to Bloomberg Business News.
</P>
<P>
   Some point to futures and commodity traders as the cause of some
of the volatility.
</P>
<P>
   The futures are publicly traded on the New York Mercantile
Exchange and are seen as a good market indicator of what gasoline
can be sold for on the wholesale market. Any change in supply or
demand is quickly reflected in the futures.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just the messenger,'' said Craig Pirrong, an assistant
professor of finance at Washington University in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   And when supplies are tight, as they are now, said Pirrong, even
a fairly minor disruption of gasoline supplies is going to have a
big effect.
</P>
<P>
   The past few weeks provided examples. The Blue Mound refinery
shutdown was one. Another was blockage in a Louisiana waterway that
temporarily stopped oil from being delivered to a refinery. And
there were some difficulties with a pipeline in Michigan. Refining
profits
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the refiners. They're in a sensitive position.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime next month, refiners are expected to announce fatter
profits when they report second-quarter earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Ting, an analyst for Salomon Smith Barney, recently said
that profits for refiners in the Midwest had increased to $8.24 a
barrel _ or about 20 cents a gallon _ from about $3 a barrel in the
second quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the chairman of Conoco Inc. said in a statement that
increases in crude oil prices and a rebound in its ``downstream
business,'' which includes the company's refineries, could produce
second-quarter profits among the best in the 125-year-old company's
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rebound we've seen in downstream is very encouraging,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   There are no indications that the oil companies have plans to be
defensive about the earnings. A year ago, refineries were
struggling and at least some, according to quarterly financial
reports, were losing money.
</P>
<P>
   Big profits are needed to build more refining plants and meet
environmental regulations, said Sternfels of the National
Petrochemical &AMP; Refiners Association. If there's no money to build
additional capacity to make gasoline, he said, then the country is
going to have problems in meeting demand for gasoline for a ``long,
long, time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry needs to have a long run of profitability,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But for now the oil companies can expect greater scrutiny of
their every move. A federal official this week asked why gasoline
prices in Chicago, which have been over $2 a gallon, had not
declined after a 25 cent a gallon drop in the wholesale market.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a question being asked in Kansas City. On Tuesday at
least some wholesale gasoline was being made available to service
stations for 6 cents a gallon less than the day before.
</P>
<P>
   But by midday Tuesday, company-owned Texaco stations had
increased their prices to $1.88 a gallon. The stations are operated
by Equiva Services LLC, a joint venture of Texaco and Shell Oil.
</P>
<P>
   Competitors, particularly QuikTrip, which sells more gasoline in
Kansas City than anyone else, didn't follow the increase. On
Thursday, the lower wholesale prices flowed through to consumers,
with some stations, including QuikTrip, reducing pump prices to
$1.63. Texaco reduced its prices to $1.66.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Equiva was asked why Texaco prices had gone up to
$1.88. Myra Jolivet, a spokeswoman for Equiva, said costs had
increased.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crude prices have gone up,'' she said.

WEB SITE LISTS IRAN COUP NAMES 
</HEADLINE>
   By EDWARD WONG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Web site about international security has published a list of
names from a CIA document that The New York Times had deleted when
it originally posted the report on its own Web site. The document
outlined the CIA's involvement in a 1953 coup in Iran.
</P>
<P>
   The Times decided to black out about two dozen names because
editors thought that publishing them might endanger the lives of
those people. Almost all were Iranians and had been involved in the
coup.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site administrator who published the names, John Young,
was able to see them on The Times' Web site when a computer
programming error allowed the names to briefly flash on the screen
of a slow-running computer.
</P>
<P>
   After blacking out the names, The Times posted the full CIA
report on its site on June 11. The full-length report was published
as supplemental information to an article that had run in the
newspaper and on the Times Web site. The article drew on
information in the full-length report to explain the CIA's
involvement in the Iran coup.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, when Young told editors of The New York Times on the
Web that he could see the names, they asked him not to make them
public. The Times fixed the computer problem that had allowed Young
to see the names, but not before he was able to release his list
later that day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We regret that these names were published,'' said Bernard
Gwertzman, editor of The New York Times on the Web. ``It seemed
unnecessary to print these names.''
</P>
<P>
   Gwertzman said the immediate impact of Young's publication of
the names was not clear. Young could not immediately be reached by
telephone for comment and did not respond to an e-mail message.
</P>
<P>
   The original CIA document was obtained by The Times and
explained in detail a joint operation by British and U.S.
intelligence agencies to overthrow Prime Minister Mohammed
Mossadegh, an elected leader with a nationalist agenda. The
agencies' plan was to install Shah Mohammed Riza Pahlevi, a
pro-Western leader. The success of the coup had far-reaching
consequences and helped set the stage for the Islamic revolution in
1979.

 CLINTON CAMPAIGN LAUNCHES 5th AD ATTACKING LAZIO  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ This is a 15-second commercial that Hillary Rodham
Clinton's Senate campaign began broadcasting Friday in upstate New
York.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCER
</P>
<P>
   DeVito/Verdi, along with Mandy Grunwald, the media consultant,
and Mark Penn, the pollster.
</P>
<P>
   ON THE SCREEN
</P>
<P>
   The commercial opens with the word ``update'' in white capital
letters on a black screen. The background remains black as the
script of the ad, read by an announcer, scrolls down the screen to
the sound of a Teletype machine. At the end, a small
black-and-white photograph of Clinton appears next to the tag line
showing the ad was paid for by her campaign.
</P>
<P>
   THE SCRIPT
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress just defeated a plan _ by only two votes _ to lower
home heating oil costs for New York and the Northeast. How did Rick
Lazio vote? He didn't. He skipped the vote. Rick Lazio. The more
you know . . . the more you wonder.''
</P>
<P>
   ACCURACY
</P>
<P>
   Lazio did miss the June 15 vote on a budget amendment that would
have set aside $10 million to establish an oil reserve that could
be tapped to limit surges in heating oil prices in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio was giving an interview during the vote. The measure,
which he had championed, was defeated, 195 to 193, but the ad does
not mention that five New York City Democrats also missed the vote.
</P>
<P>
   SCORECARD
</P>
<P>
   The commercial is the fifth in a barrage of attack ads released
by Clinton's campaign in recent days. The cost of heating oil is a
sensitive issue, especially in the colder regions of the state, and
the ad may well raise questions about Lazio with some voters.
</P>
<P>
   But the ad itself, a quick 15 seconds of text on the screen,
leaves no lasting visual impression. &QL;

   LOS ANGELES _ Sean O'Donnell, the rugged defenseman who served
as a Los Angeles Kings alternate captain for three seasons, was
selected Friday by the Minnesota Wild in the 2000 NHL expansion
draft.
</P>
<P>
   Forward Steve McKenna also was taken by the Wild, who will join
the Columbus Blue Jackets as new teams this season.
</P>
<P>
   But it was O'Donnell who contributed most to the Kings' 94-point
showing last year, fourth best in franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sean was here for six years and he will be missed,'' Kings
general manager Dave Taylor said from the expansion draft in
Calgary. ``We went to Minnesota several times with trade proposals
in an effort to keep him, but in the end they went in a different
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, who now shifts his attention to today's entry draft for
amateur players, realized he had lost two of his more physical
players Friday, but he said the NHL is more geared toward speed and
defense.
</P>
<P>
   But Taylor also faces the prospect of losing both members of his
second defensive unit. Garry Galley, who played alongside
O'Donnell, is an unrestricted free agent. At age 37, Galley is not
expected to return.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell, 28, was drafted by Buffalo in June 1994 but joined
the Kings later that summer. Although he was a steady defenseman,
O'Donnell might be best known for a penalty he took during Game 3
of the Kings' 1998 first-round playoff loss to St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings trailed the series 2-0, but led the game 3-0 in the
third period when O'Donnell pummeled the Blues' Geoff Courtnall for
taking a shot at goaltender Jamie Storr. O'Donnell received a
five-minute major penalty and St. Louis scored four goals during
the man advantage before going on to sweep the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very difficult time after that, but I will never
forget how supportive my teammates were,'' said O'Donnell, who
could not be reached Friday. ``I never regretted what I did because
it was the right play, but I certainly regret the outcome.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell, who earned $1 million last season, had two goals and
14 points. He did, however, score the winning goal in overtime
against Calgary on Feb. 14. O'Donnell also scored a goal in Game 2
of the Kings' first-round playoff loss to Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Off the ice, his father Emmitt suffered a stroke at the family
home in Ontario, forcing O'Donnell to miss one game and make
several trips back on off days.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings had hoped the 6-foot-7 McKenna, 27, would play an
enforcer role on the fourth line, but he was limited offensively
and played just 46 games.
</P>
<P>
   During the season, the biggest intrigue with McKenna was whether
he would participate in 40 games, which would have forced the team
to either protect or expose him to the draft.
</P>
<P>
   Even though McKenna was made available for expansion, the Kings
had scheduled him to play in Italy this summer for conditioning
purposes. Last season, he had just five assists, but his 125
penalty minutes were third on the club.
</P>
<P>
   Note: The Kings have the 20th pick in the first round. There are
nine rounds spread over two days. In addition to Taylor, Kings
coach Andy Murray and top amateur scout Al Murray are representing
the club in Calgary.
