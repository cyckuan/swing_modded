<HEADLINE> Cambodian King Calls For National Unity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, July 18 (Xinhua) -- All nationalities in Cambodia
are equal and should unite to build the country, says Cambodian
King Norodom Sihanouk.
</P>
<P>
Meeting with the delegates to a national minority conference on
Thursday, Sihanouk said all the nationalities in Cambodia,
regardless of size, sex and wealth, were equal.
</P>
<P>
The King called on them to unite, help, support and respect
each other and build the country into a prosperous, progressive,
civilized and peaceful nation.
</P>
<P>
He dismissed concern that minorities faced the threat of being
"Khmerized."
</P>
<P>
All nationalities had the right to choose their own beliefs
under the constitution, and the Khmer would never force other
nationalities to believe in Buddhism, the King said.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia has more than 20 nationalities with the Khmer
accounting for 90 percent of the country's population.

<HEADLINE> UK Firms, Top Takeover Targets in Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 18 (Xinhua) -- British companies are the most
popular takeover targets in Europe, and the value of UK businesses
acquired by overseas companies rose by 31 percent to more than 12
billion pounds (18.6 billion US dollars) in the first half of the
year.
</P>
<P>
According to the accountancy firm KPMG, business services
companies were the most sought after, followed by those in the oil
and gas sector.
</P>
<P>
This was the highest level of inward corporate investment into
Britain during any six months since the company started its
surveys in 1989.
</P>
<P>
Richard Agutter, head of KPMG's corporate finance operation,
said, "This suggests that last year's record total of 35.03
billion US dollars of foreign acquisitions will be broken."
</P>
<P>
He said that the global takeover activity over the past two
years had been fairly static, but it was now going from strength
to strength in the UK, despite election uncertainty and the
possibility that Britain might refuse to participate in any single
European currency.
</P>
<P>
The buying spree in the UK was led by American firms, which
made 9.24 billion US dollars worth of acquisitions, followed by
firms from Denmark, Norway and Ireland, while French and German
companies had sharply cut back their new activity in Britain.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, foreign takeover of UK firms has been accompanied by
British companies buying more than 10 billion pounds (15.5 billion
US dollars) worth of overseas businesses in the first six months,
which is 26 percent up on last year, and the largest outward
investment by any European country.

<HEADLINE> Japan to Retaliate Against U.S. Air Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Japan will take retaliatory action
against the United States if it imposes sanctions on Japan
Airlines (JAL) cargo flights, the Transport Ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
Japan would ban a U.S. airline from operating flights between
Japan and five Asian destinations -- Manila and Cebu in the
Phillipines, Kuala Lumpur and Penang in Malaysia, and Singapore,
the Kyodo News Service reported, quoting ministry officials.
</P>
<P>
Washington launched proceedings for sanctions against JAL on
Tuesday to counter Japan's refusal of flight requests by the
U.S. cargo carrier, Federal Express Corp. (FedEx).
</P>
<P>
FedEx applied to the Japanese Transport Ministry to open five
new flights to Asian countries under the "beyond rights"
convention which allows for freely opening new routes and
boosting flight frequencies beyond Japan to third nations.
</P>
<P>
FedEx had planned to begin on July 1 the requested new summer
schedules -- involving increased flights from Kansai International
Airport near Osaka to Manila and Cebu, and Indonesia's Jakarta,
and starting new flights from the airport to China's Shanghai and
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government said U.S. airlines had no vested rights
for flights to the Chinese cities, and needed documents were not
submitted for approval for the other three routes.
</P>
<P>
It said Japan's refusal to grant the FedEx requests was in line
with the bilateral aviation agreement and the latest U.S. action
was unacceptable.

<HEADLINE> France "Dismayed" by TWA Boeing 747 Explosion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 18 (Xinhua) -- France said that it is dismayed by
the explosion of a Boeing 747 of the TWA air company above the
beach of Long Island, New York, today.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt said that
the French government is in permanent contact with the U.S.
government on the development of investigations on the explosion
and searching of possible survivors.
</P>
<P>
A TWA Boeing 747 on its way to Paris blew up this morning
shortly taking off from the JFK airport. Rescuers in the Atlantic
Ocean off Long Island said there is no sign of any survivor from
the 229 people on board.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac, who is on a visit in Africa,
has sent a message to U.S. President Bill Clinton expressing his
"feeling of very turbulent emotion and consternation" after
hearing the news.
</P>
<P>
"In the explosion of this plane, French victims and American
victims died. I will keep them in deep memory," the president
said, adding that he is sure that the circumstances around the
explosion will be made clear.
</P>
<P>
The French Foreign Ministry spokesman said he is not sure how
many French passengers were on board, because there was no
indication of nationality on the list of the names of the
passengers. But said there were Frenchmen and Frenchwomen on the
plane.
</P>
<P>
A dozen relatives of the passengers on board the plane waited
at Charles de Gaulle airport this morning with the hope of hearing
the news of their survival.
</P>
<P>
Charles de Gaulle airport has set up a crisis team consisting
of police, airport officials and doctors, said an airport
official.

<HEADLINE> Hebron Mayor: Israel May Withdraw in Two Weeks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Hebron Mayor Mustafa Natshe
said today he believed that Israel would decide to redeploy its
army from the West Bank town, and would announce a decision in two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
Natsheh made the remarks to reporters following a meeting with
the members of the Interior Committee of the Knesset (Israel's
parliament), who visited the town today to learn at first hand
about the problems in the redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Labor Party's Saleh Tarif, a member of the committee, said
that the Israeli army is ready to pullout from the disputed town,
and is able to implement the redeployment "immediately."
</P>
<P>
While agreeing that there might be problems for the safety of
the Jewish settlers in the town after a possible army withdrawal,
Tarif expressed his hope that the implementation of the peace
agreements will bring peace to the city.
</P>
<P>
During their visit today, the members of the committee also
held meetings with senior army officers and Jewish settlers in
the town.
</P>
<P>
Settlers stressed at the meeting that there could be only one
sovereign body in charge of the security in the town, not two,
claiming this principle was promised to them by senior army
officers.
</P>
<P>
According to the Oslo 2 accord, the Israeli army was supposed
to pullback from about 85 percent of Hebron by March 28, however,
following a series of suicide bombing attacks, former Prime
Minister Shimon Peres delayed the redeployment.
</P>
<P>
In May, the former Israeli government announced that the
army's withdrawal from Hebron would be carried out after the May
29 general elections, due to security reasons.
</P>
<P>
However, Peres, defeated by Netanyahu, said after the
elections that he would leave the decision of the redeployment
to the new prime minister and his government.
</P>
<P>
Hebron, some 30 kilometers southwest of Jerusalem, is a
place of pilgrimage for Christians, Jews and Muslims alike,
and tradition has it that patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and
their wives are all buried in the Machpelah Cave (Haram
al-Khalil).
</P>
<P>
There are some 400 Jewish settlers now living in the
center of Hebron, who moved back to the city's old Jewish
neighborhood after the 1967 War, during which Israel captured
the town from the Jordanian authority.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, surrounding the Jewish community, there are more
than 200,000 Palestinian residents living in most other parts
of the city.
</P>
<P>
During his election campaign, Netanyahu had said that he
would like Hebron to be part of the final status
arrangements with the Palestinians, but, at the same time, he
also said he would stand by the international agreements.
</P>
<P>
So far, Netanyahu repeatedly said he has been studying the
issue of the redeployment in Hebron, but giving no date or
under what conditions he would make the final decision.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Children to Be Vaccinated Against Polio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Health will start a
campaign next month to inject millions of children below five
with polio vaccine, a source of the ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
About 2.81 million Angolan children in 137 districts of 18
provinces will be vaccinated at 1,526 stations twice, the first
on August 14 and 18 and the second from September 14 to 18, said
the source.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that 1,912 doctors or nurses will be needed
for the job along with more than 5,000 supporting personnel and
all enterprises, government organs and ngos, churches and sports
clubs have been urged to render support for the campaign.
</P>
<P>
Rotary International Fund has provided 1.812 million U.S.
Dollars and the World Health Organization and other U.N.
organizations have rendered technical assistance for the job.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has at present had 7.32 million vaccines which
are worth 690,000 US Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The target is to wipe out polio by the year of 2005, and
Angola, due to long years of civil war, has been lagged far
behind in this respect, according to the source.

<HEADLINE> UK Unemployment Falls to 5-Year Low in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The number of people in Britain out
of work and claiming unemployment benefit fell by 14,300 in June
to 2.2 million, 7.7 percent of the workforce, according to figures
released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
</P>
<P>
The data also suggested that unemployment was now at the lowest
level for five years and last month was the fourth successive
month for the total number of people out of work to fall.
</P>
<P>
Taking into account some special factors, including a small
number of BSE-related job losses, the ONS said that this indicated
a downward monthly trend of about 10,000-15,000.
</P>
<P>
Claimant unemployment fell in all regions except Scotland and
Northern Ireland. And women fared worse than men. Male claimant
unemployment fell 14,900 in June while female unemployment rose by
600.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the ONS data showed the annual rate of pay
increases fell from 3.75 percent in May to 3.5 percent last month,
the first fall for more than two years.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that evidence of muted pay pressures vindicated
the Chancellor Kenneth Clarke's decision to cut base interest
rates by a quarter-point to 5.75 percent last month.
</P>
<P>
The Chancellor himself Wednesday welcomed the trends, saying
that the fall in unemployment to its lowest level since 1991
showed clearly that "the UK is into its fourth year of good news
on jobs" and his decision to cut interest rates last month "posed
no threat to the government's inflation target."

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC) has
cleared humanitarian aid worth ECU 1.52 million (1.98 million
U.S. dollars) for victims of chronic faction-fighting in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The aid, channelled via the European Community Humanitarian
Office (ECHO), will enable the United Nations Children's Fund and
international non-governmental organizations (NGOs) from Belgium,
Spain, Germany and France to carry out practical work in the field
over the next eight months.
</P>
<P>
The ECHO has scaled down its presence in Somalia over the past
two years, but it said there were still pockets of territory with
emergency needs.
</P>
<P>
Four of five projects were in areas not yet eligible for
rehabilitation funding. They were all medical aid projects aimed
at providing minimum cover for the most vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
The fifth project was a vaccination program against measles.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, ECHO has funded humanitarian projects (health, food
sanitation) to a value of ECU 18.75 million (24.4 million U.S.
dollars) through NGOs and international agencies.
</P>
<P>
Since 1994, the EC has been also been implementing the First
Rehabilitation Program for Somalia which currently comprises 58
projects. They involve livestock, education, health, water and
sanitation, agriculture and training, amounting to a total cost of
ECU 38 million (49.4 million U.S. dollars).

<P>
MAPUTO, July 18 (Xinhua) -- A total of 1,766 criminal cases
were reported in Maputo Province of Mozambique in the first six
months of this year.
</P>
<P>
The figure is 43 more compared with that in the same peroid
of last year.
</P>
<P>
Raimundo Macie, Police Commander of Maputo Province, said
here today 1,118 of the 1,766 criminal cases were armed
robberies.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,870 people were prosecuted for various cases from
January to June this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
The police in the same period destroyed 60 criminal groups
engaged in drugs and arms trafficking, car thefts and armed
robberies.
</P>
<P>
Macie attributed the increase in criminal cases mainly to the
failure in collecting the weapons scattered among the civilians
after the termination of the 16-year civil war in the southern
African nation. enditem

<HEADLINE> 5,200 School Children Hit By Food Poisoning in Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 17 (Xinhua) -- School children hit by mass food
poisoning topped 5,200 today in the western Japanese city of Sakai.
</P>
<P>
At the latest count, some 420 children were still hospitalized
by the recent outbreak, caused by the virulent O-157 colon
bacillus which contaminated school lunches at Sakai, Osaka
Prefecture.
</P>
<P>
The food poisoning has affected the largest number of children
since the bacillus triggered another outbreak among school
children in late May, and is the worst such incident involving
school lunches.
</P>
<P>
According to the Health and Welfare Ministry, the number of
people falling victim to the O-157 strain of E. Coli bacteria
totalled 7,109 nationwide as of 6:00 p.m. today. Of these, four
had died, ministry officials said.

<HEADLINE> Eritrea Barred From Atlanta Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The International Olympic
Committee (IOC) has turned down the last minute appeal by the tiny
East African country of Eritrea to compete at the forthcoming
Atlanta Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
According to a report reaching here today, the IOC maintained
that Eritrea did not fulfill the requirements of entry, adding
that the Eritrean National Olympic Committee (ENOC) was not
recognised by the IOC, making it impossible for Eritrea's athletes
to get the United States visas.
</P>
<P>
A team consisting of two cyclists and an official from the
Eritrea National Olympic Committee (ENOC), was ready to fly to
Atlanta for the Atlanta games.
</P>
<P>
If allowed, this will be the first delegation sent by the new
African country to attend the Olympic Games since Eritrea gained
independence and became a member of the United Nations in May,
1993.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say Eritrea's exclusion leaves Atlanta short of its
desire for being the first host to welcome the entire world to the
Games. All 197 IOC members have accepted the invitation to
come.

<HEADLINE> Olympians Being Offered Huge Incentives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Athletes to the 26th Olympic Games
due to open Friday are offered or promised a huge sum of money or
other lucrative incentives by their national sports governing
bodies or governments if they can bring home medals, preferably
gold ones.
</P>
<P>
Gold medal winners are reportedly to receive cash rewards
ranging from several thousand to hundreds of thousands of U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
On top of cash rewards, Olympic medalists may get a sedan car
and a new house or an apartment.
</P>
<P>
This has led to a contraversy with quite a few people
criticizing this practice as running counter to Olympic amateurism
and linking the Olympic Games too much with commercialism.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines is reportedly offering the most attractive
incentives to an Olympic gold medal winner -- a check of 10
million pesos or 400,000 U.S. dollars in addition to a new house
and a car.
</P>
<P>
Next come Italy and Thailand -- an equivalent of 120,000 U.S.
dollars for a gold medal.
</P>
<P>
Mexico and Russia are each offering 100,000 U.S. dollars to the
winner of an Olympic gold while Spain promises to give 80,000
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The United States, Germany, Chile, Georgia and Khazakistan will
award 50,000 dollars to the Olympic gold medal winner, 30,000
dollars to the silver medal winner and 20,000 dollars to the
bronze medal winner.
</P>
<P>
But a Kenyan gold medalist will receive a relatively slim sum
of 3,300 dollars while a Frenchman is only offered an equivalent
of 2,000 dollars.

<HEADLINE> France to Send Financial Oxygen Balloon to Corsica </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 17 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Alain Juppe
announced today in Ajaccio, Corsica, that the central government
will send 3.5 billion francs (700 million U.S. dollars) in
financial aid to the Mediterranean island in five years.
</P>
<P>
Juppe, who arrived in Corsica today on a working tour, also
said that those assassins and law-breakers must be "relentlessly
hunted, arrested and brought to the justice."
</P>
<P>
The financing package will be mainly used to build a free
economic zone in Corsica, which will allow enterprises to take
advantage of "some fiscal exemptions and alleviated social
charges," Agence France Presse quoted Juppe as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, the plan to build the zone, which was announced in
March by the French government, will have to be agreed upon by the
European Union, which reportedly has some reservations over the
plan.
</P>
<P>
Corsica has been plagued by violences originating from
separatist activities for 20 years.

<HEADLINE> Major's Timetable for Lifting Beef Ban in Deep Doubt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 18 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John Major's
timetable for lifting the European Union's ban on British beef
products exports has been thrown into deep doubt as the program of
slaughtering cattles is likely to be delayed.
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's tough stance against Ministry of Agriculture
demands on compensation for farmers of some 200 million pounds
(310 milliion U.S. dollars) has forced a delay in legislating for
the slaughter of 120,000 cattle.
</P>
<P>
The Treasury is strongly opposing such a generous full
replacement payout and pressing for compensation based on market
value -- likely to cost a little over half of the proposed amount.
</P>
<P>
An official of the Ministry of Agriculture announced earlier
today that as the legislation for the slaughter program would not
be laid until after parliament returned from its summer break in
October, the program would not be implemented before parliament
had a chance to debate it.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister John Major pledged earlier that Britain would be
in a position to see almost all elements for the global ban lifted
by November.
</P>
<P>
But the EU Commission has repeatedly made it clear that
slaughter of the required number of cattles is central to the EU
agreement on a phased lifting of the ban.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts say that even if the legislation went through in
mid-October, there was still doubt the slaughter would begin
before November and it could take weeks of EU procedures to
approve a phased lifting of the beef ban.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sir David Naish, president of the National Farmers'
Union, was quoted as saying that "if the delay caused a hold-up in
lifting the ban, the entire industry is under pressure and that
will cost money."
</P>
<P>
The opposition Labor Party said that the government's plans to
lift the four-month-old worldwide embargo on British beef products
exports were in tatters.
</P>
<P>
Shadow Agriculture Minister Gavin Strang said that it was
disastrous news for British farmers that cattle cull laws had been
delayed until October.
</P>
<P>
The EU imposed the worldwide ban on British beef products in
March when the British government admitted that there were
possible links between BSE or mad cow disease and its human
equivalent Creutzfeldt-Jocob Disease.

<HEADLINE> FIVB Rejects Sydney Games Volleyball Venue Arrangement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Ruben Acosta, President of the
International Volleyball Federation (FIVB), rejected Sydney 2000
Olympic Games proposal concerning the venues for volleyball.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here on Wednesday, Acosta said
the congress, held between July 14 and 16, rejected Sydney's
proposal which would reduce the seats by two thirds from over
600,000 in Atlanta to about 200,000 in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
"FIVB insists on playing eliminatories in Sydney and Melbourne
at least during the games four years late," he said.
</P>
<P>
The congress also decided to provide technical and material
support to those countries and regions where volleyball is in
medial level, helping them enhance competitive capabilities. These
countries include Sweden, France, Mexico, Egypt, Canada and
Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
The president said FIVB will maintain its efforts in
implementing the World Plan 2001 through each national
federations, seeking to establish national leagues, both semi
professional and professional, in more than 100 countries and
regions by the year 2001.
</P>
<P>
Acosta said from next year, the total prize of the World Men's
Volleyball League will be raised from current six million U.S.
dollars to eight million.

PARIS, July 18 (Xinhua) -- France and Russia signed an
agreement Wednesday in Moscow on the creation of a joint venture
which will take charge of commercial operation of the Soyuz
launchers, the French state space company Aerospatiale announced
today.
</P>
<P>
According to a communique issued by Aerospatiale, the new joint
venture, Starsem, will be a French registered corporation
headquartered near Paris.
</P>
<P>
France's Aerospatiale and Arianespace and Russia's RKA space
agency and Samara space center will be jointly running Starsem,
which will offer service in sending small satellites and
constellation of satellites into low or medium orbits for
customers worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The communique said that Soyuz, which has successfully carried
out 1,500 missions, including those of sending Russian astronauts
into space, is one of the world's most reliable rockets.
</P>
<P>
French Space Minister Franois Fillon, who attended the signing
ceremony in Moscow, said this week that France made the decision
to set up the joint venture in order to better compete with the
United States in the global space market.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the United States is also absorbing Russian space
technology by setting up the Lockheed-Martin-Proton joint venture
recently.

<P>
PYONGYANG, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) today began a "Solidarity with the Cuban
People" month, to demonstrate the Korean people's support for
Cuban people and further strengthen bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
An accompanying editorial in the official Rodong Sinmum
newspaper called "Firm Support, Resolute Support," said the
Korean people "will fully support the just cause of the Cuban
people."
</P>
<P>
Imperialists have tried all contemptible means in an attempt to
strangle socialist Cuba.
</P>
<P>
For the past several decades, imperialists have not only tried
to vilify Cuba internationally, but have also attempted to isolate
it politically, smother it economically, and strangle it
militarily, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
However, none of these plots could make the Cuban people
succumb and they have never retreated from the road they have
chosen themselves, it noted.
</P>
<P>
Despite the vast oceans that separate the two countries, the
two peoples are closely bound together by their friendship, and
the Korean people will always support the Cuban people's just
cause in safeguarding their national independence and sovereignty,
the editorial said.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Forces Hit by Another Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Thirty-four Canadian soldiers,
suspected of misconduct at a mental hospital during a peacekeeping
mission in Bosnia three years ago, will be investigated.
</P>
<P>
They are accused of alcohol abuse, sexual misconduct, black
marketeering and violence against the Bosnian patients.
</P>
<P>
The latest scandal, which allegedly took place between October
1993 and April 1994 at the Balkovici hospital 35 kilometers
northwest of Sarajevo, involved members of the 2nd Canadian
Battalion, local reports said.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian peacekeepers had been praised for their courageous
work in bringing relief to hundreds of stranded, starving children
and mentally sick patients in war-torn Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Lieutenant-General Maurice Baril, commander of Land Force
Command, told a news conference Wednesday that he was distressed
to tell the public "there is clear evidence" of misconduct by
the Canadian peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
Baril, who became the army commander 10 months ago, blamed the
misconduct on a serious leadership problem, particularly lack of
command and control in the army.
</P>
<P>
The accusations come at a time when the Canadian forces are
still reeling from charges of misconduct by its airborne troops
during the peacekeeping mission in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Baril said the army had to "to move fast and clean our house",
restoring leadership and public confidence in the service.
</P>
<P>
He said he wanted to show that the army had learned from the
Somalia fiasco.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Defense Minister David Collenette said he supported
the army's action in dealing with the misconduct.

<HEADLINE> No Pact Solely in Donors' Interests for Namibia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Namibia would never enter
into cooperation agreements which promote only the donors'
interests, and are not geared toward promoting national policies,
Cabinet Secretary Isaac Kaulinge said in Windhoek today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting between British overseas development aid
delegates and senior government officials, Kaulinge said Namibia
has had enough of agreements which could lead to the country
remaining dependent on hand-outs, reported the South African
Press Association.
</P>
<P>
''Aid must not come with strings attached. It must not place
long term financial burdens or conditions on our fledgling
democracy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Kaulinge said it is not a case of biting the hand
that feeds you, adding aid programs have to promote national
policies and not only cater for donors' interests.
</P>
<P>
Namibia welcomed donor assistance, but it should be designed
to meet socio-economic needs and ensure self-sufficiency, he
noted.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Women Spikers Climb Cliff for Olympic Medals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Ten years ago, the Chinese women
spikers peaked by winning five world titles in a row. But now
their successors are only tempted to mount a prickly cliff en
route to their hopeful bronze medals at the Centennial Olympic
Games in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
A dire situation confronts the new squad which is coached by
Lang Ping, former ace spiker who had orchestrated her peers to
reap five world titles from 1981 to 1986.
</P>
<P>
"We have to topple either world champions Cuba or World Cup
runners-up Brazil or the hosts the United States to clinch a berth
on the ceremony podium," said the 35-year-old woman coach.
</P>
<P>
Pooled in Group A, China is tipped to advance together with the
United States into the semifinals where Cuba and Brazil are
expected to secure the other two spots.
</P>
<P>
"Although our girls have no upper hand in technical skills or
in experience, they are young and full of hopes and will surely
stage serious threats against the leading trio in Atlanta as well
as in the world," said Lang Ping.
</P>
<P>
After the intensive training in their home camp prior to the
Olympics, ace attacker Sun Yue, 23, is full of confidence. "There
is enough pressure for us to beat one of the top three," she
said. "But we are going to reap a good harvest through our
unremitting efforts."
</P>
<P>
That may be achieved by the Chinese women who have not tasted
the juicy title for 10 years after their predecessors bid farewell
to the world champion at the 1988 Seoul Olympics.
</P>
<P>
In May last year, China outwitted stars-absent Cuba twice on
the home turf and became the Asian champions before winning four
straight victories against the United States this year.
</P>
<P>
However, the Chinese women are still rough in both skills and
teamwork which justify their fourth finish at the so-called
mini-Olympics last month in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
"We're in a position to challenge the top trio, and any merit
can only be achieved through performances on the spot," said the
Chinese head coach.
</P>
<P>
For years, Cuba, led by Mireya Luis, is still the dominant
force in the women's volleyball after making its Olympic debut in
the 1964 Tokyo Games, and it comes to Atlanta as the heavy
favorite for a second consecutive gold medal after reaping its
third successive World Cup win in Japan last November.
</P>
<P>
Both Brazil and the United States are sure to vie for the
medals offered at the Games to be opened Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
In the men's version, Italy appeares certain to continue its
winning streak that includes two World Leagues, two European
championships and one world title.
</P>
<P>
And fans can look for both Brazil and the Netherlands to fight
out for the silver and bronze medals through masculine jump serves.
</P>
<P>
As beach volleyball is introduced for the first time into the
Olympic agenda, Brazilian pair Sandra Pires and Jackie Silva are
hot favorites for the top honor.
</P>
<P>
Other contenders include another Brazilian duo of Monica
Rodrigues and Adriana Samuel, American Holly McPeak and Nancy
Reno, and Australian Natalie Cook and Kerri Ann Pottharst.
</P>
<P>
Karch Kiraly, two-time Olympic court volleyball champion, and
his American partner Kent Steffes are the prime candidates for the
first Olympic men's title from the beach.

<HEADLINE> Euro-Asia Meeting to Tackle Trade and Investment Barriers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Top officials from Europe and
Asia will meet in Brussels next week to discuss ways of improving
the investment climate worldwide and to prepare the ground for
solid measures to increase trade and investment between the two
regions.
</P>
<P>
Taking their cue from the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) summit in
Bangkok last March, senior officials from 25 European and Asian
countries will join the European Commission (EC) and the Irish
Presidency for two days of intensive discussions on July 24 and 25.
</P>
<P>
According to the EC, the main focus of the meeting will be to
meld European and Asian views on how to liberalize investment at
world levels.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will also initiate preparations for a strategy to
reduce regulatory barriers hindering European exports to Asia,
which currently run at around 80,000 million U.S. dollars a year,
and vice-versa, while preparing an investment promotion action
plan.
</P>
<P>
The ASEM Summit called for an informal senior officials'
meeting on how to promote economic cooperation between the two
regions, and in particular the liberalization and facilitation of
trade and investment, with an initial emphasis on WTO issues.
</P>
<P>
The growing importance of economic relations between Europe and
Asia is hard to exaggerate. Asia itself will account for a massive
slice of world trade in the next century, generating half the
growth in global trade from now until the year 2000, according to
the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
The European Union now trades more with Asia than it does with
the United States.
</P>
<P>
According to EC statistics, its trade with all countries of
Asia was worth 312.5 billion U.S. dollars in 1994, while trade
with the US for the same year was 235 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The EU said it was well placed to take advantage of these new
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
With its advanced technological base, Europe could meet the
region's rising demand for sophisticated consumer goods and
services.
</P>
<P>
Demand would soar, too, in other sectors where EU companies had
a comparative advantage such as banking, energy, environmental
technologies and transport equipment.
</P>
<P>
However, it was clear from the statistics that European
companies could do further trade exporting and investing more in
Asia, it said.

LUSAKA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Vice-President Godfrey Miyanda
today expressed his concern at misallocation of resources and
blamed it for the poor economic performance in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
"We have so much resources at our disposal and Zambia would not

<HEADLINE> Japan's Trade Surplus Down Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Japan's trade surplus in the first
half of 1996 dropped by 40.1 percent compared with the same period
the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry said on Thursday that the drop was mainly
caused by increasing imports.
</P>
<P>
The trade surplus in the January-June period decreased to
3,111.16 billion yen (31.112 billion U.S. dollars), representing a
drop for the sixth consecutive half-year period and the largest
decline in the past 16 years, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
It said Japan's trade surplus with the United States fell 34.6
percent to 1,505.42 billion yen (15.054 billion dollars) in the
six-month period.
</P>
<P>
The decline in the trade was expected because of the
devaluation of the yen, changing crude oil prices and increasing
imports of electronic products.

<HEADLINE> Ministers Urge Quicker Action to Stop Climate Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Ministers attending a climate
conference in Geneva issued today a nonbinding political statement
calling upon countries to act swiftly to negotiate a "legally
binding instrument" to reduce greenhouse gas emissions after the
year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The ministerial declaration, which was presented to the Second
Conference of the Parties to the 1992 Climate Change Convention
due to end Friday, endorsed the validity of scientific evidence
that suggests a "discernible human influence" on climate change.
</P>
<P>
It said the scientific report presented by the International
Panel on Climate Change recently "should provide a scientific
basis for urgently strengthening action at the global, regional
and national levels" to control climate change.
</P>
<P>
Ministers agreed today to instruct their representatives to
accelerate negotiations on a "legally binding" protocol or another
legal instrument under which industrial nations would commit
themselves to further reductions in their greenhouse gas emissions
after the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
In the climate convention, negotiated in the 1992 Rio Earth
summit, industrial nations set a nonbinding goal of limiting
emissions of greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide, by 2000
to the levels that prevailed in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Although most of the countries are unlikely to meet that goal,
they have since conceded that even deeper cuts in emissions are
needed.
</P>
<P>
The two-week meetings in Geneva, however, have not been able to
agree upon the exact level and time-frame for controlling
emissions, which are the most substantive and critical issues.
</P>
<P>
Negotiators have to overcome those obstacles before December
next year when the next climate conference is due to convene in
Japan to adopt the agreement.
</P>
<P>
According to Michael Zammit Cutajar, executive secretary of the
convention, today's ministerial declaration was endorsed by an
"overwhelming majority" of participating countries.
</P>
<P>
But about 16 countries, including Australia, New Zealand, a
group of oil exporting developing countries and Russia, said they
had reservations about the text.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Trade Deficit Hits Eight-Year High in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. trade deficit shot up
to 10.9 billion dollars in May, the largest imbalance in eight
years, the Commerce Department said here today.
</P>
<P>
According to figures released by the department, the monthly
deficit was 13.2 percent higher than a revised April deficit of
9.6 billion dollars, and was due to surging imports of cars and
consumer goods such as toys and games which hit an all-time high.
</P>
<P>
Imports and exports both rose to record highs, but the 2.6
percent advance in imports surpassed the 1.1 percent gain in
American sales abroad.
</P>
<P>
For May, imports of goods and services rose to 80.6 billion
dollars, an increase of 2.04 billion dollars from April. Almost
half the growth came from an increase of 966 million dollars in
autos and auto parts.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. imported 686 million dollars more of consumer goods
totaling to 14.2 billion dollars in May. This was led by a jump of
178 million dollars in imports of toys and electronic games.
</P>
<P>
Foreign oil purchases increased 6.5 percent with imports of
crude oil climbing to 4.6 billion dollars, the highest level since
November 1990. The price per barrel, which had been rising sharply
for two months, declined slightly from 19.33 dollars in April to
18.95 dollars per barrel, but the volume of imports increased.
</P>
<P>
In exports, American sales of goods and services rose to an
all-time high of 69.7 billion dollars with sales of consumer goods
up 136 million dollars in May, led by household products.
</P>
<P>
The monthly deficit with Japan narrowed dramatically in May,
falling 23.7 percent to 3.13 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
While automotive imports from Japan were up 50 million dollars,
this growth was overshadowed by increases in autos and parts worth
303 million dollars from Canada, 148 million dollars from Mexico
and 132 million dollars from Germany.
</P>
<P>
America's trade deficit with Mexico rose 1.7 percent to 1.6
billion dollars as both U.S. exports to Mexico and imports from
the southern neighboring country lifted to record levels.
</P>
<P>
The deficit with Canada, America's northern neighbor and other
partner in the North American Free Trade Agreement, soared 53
percent to 2.5 billion dollars, the largest gap since November
1986.
</P>
<P>
It marked the third straight month the U.S. overall deficit had
worsened and left its trade deficit running at an annual rate of
107.6 billion dollars. This exceeded last year's deficit of 105.1
billion dollars which had been the worst showing in seven years.
</P>
<P>
The 10.9 billion dollars May deficit was the worst performance
since the deficit averaged 12.9 billion dollars per month in the
fourth quarter of 1987. At that time, the government only recorded
trade flows in goods and services on a quarterly basis. It started
the monthly reporting of goods and services in 1992.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot, Turkish Army Commanders to Meet for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The Commanders of the Cypriot
National Guard and the Turkish forces in Cyprus will meet as soon
as possible under the auspices of the U.N. Commander, a senior
U.S. diplomat announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference at the end of her 24-hour visit
to Cyprus, U.S. permanent representative to the U.N. Madeleine
Albright announced that "I am heartened that I can report some
concrete progress. For the first time the two sides have indicated
a willingness to convene a meeting of the Commander of the
National Guard, and the Commander of Turkish forces in Cyprus,
under the auspices of U.N. Commander as soon as possible."
</P>
<P>
This is the first time in 22 years, since the Turkish invasion
of Cyprus, that the Commanders of the two armies will meet to
discuss security issues.
</P>
<P>
Albright said such a meeting can help avoid misunderstandings
and ensure effective implementation of the relevant U.N. proposals
to reduce tensions along the buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
"This is exactly the kind of practical beginning I hope to
achieve," she said.
</P>
<P>
Albright, who arrived here Wednesday afternoon to discuss the
Cyprus problem with Greek and Turkish Cypriot leaders, is
accompanied on her mission by U.S. presidential emissary for
Cyprus Richard Beattie, State Department special co-ordinator for
Cyprus James Williams, Director of the State Department's office
of southern European affairs Robert Cavano and Pentagon
specialists.
</P>
<P>
The American diplomat told the press that she "did come with
specific views about what needs to be done along the buffer zone
and that both sides shared this concern and agreed to work
extensively on the latest U.N. proposal in this area."
</P>
<P>
"The time has come for practical solutions and a comprehensive
settlement to the Cyprus conflict for the sake of the people who
live here and to ensure the regional stability," Albright said.
</P>
<P>
On her meetings she held during her stay here, Albright said
that "the focus of our meetings has been to explore whether an
opportunity exists to achieve a comprehensive and lasting
settlement for Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
The American ambassador said she has "no illusions about the
difficulty of this task and we know that if such a peace is to be
reached it will require a great deal of diplomatic groundwork."
</P>
<P>
U.S. presidential emissary Richard Beattie, who is
accompanying her, will be continuing this process intensively in
the coming months, She said.
</P>
<P>
Albright noted that many Cyprus peace initiatives have come
and gone. "Nevertheless, we are convinced that an opportunity
exists for progress. Assisting the parties to seize this
opportunity as long as it exists is now our diplomatic goal," she
added.
</P>
<P>
The American diplomat said U.S. President Bill Clinton's
Administration believes that the only practical way to resolve a
problem as complex as that of Cyprus, is with direct,
comprehensive negotiations between the parties.
</P>
<P>
However, she said it is clear that much work needs to be done
beforehand to narrow the differences and thereby give the direct
negotiations the greatest chance of success.
</P>
<P>
Albright said finally that a true Cyprus solution can only
come when the parties and the people are ready. "But our message
today is a simple one: the Clinton Administration is prepared to
offer a helping hand to those who are prepared to take a risk for
peace. I believe our visit has provided an excellent foundation
for more active and direct U.S. diplomacy in the coming months."
</P>
<P>
Albright had a 90-minute working breakfast meeting today with
Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides at the Presidential Palace and
a separate meeting with Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash in
the Turkish-controlled northern part of Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
She also had meetings with Commander of the National Guard
Nicolaos Vorvolakos and Commander of the Turkish forces in Cyprus
Hasan Kundaksi.
</P>
<P>
Albright left this evening for Ankara, the third leg of her
current three-nation tour which had taken her to Athens and
Nicosia.

<HEADLINE> France Dismayed by U.S. Plane Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 18 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
expressed dismay to U.S. President Bill Clinton today over the
explosion near New York of a Boeing 747 of the TWA air company,
which killed all the 229 people aboard.
</P>
<P>
"In the explosion of this plane, French victims and American
victims died," Chirac said.
</P>
<P>
He said the victims would remain long in his memory. He was
sure that the circumstances surrounding the explosion would be made
clear.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, French Foreign Ministry Spokesman Jacques
Rummelhardt said that the French government would be in permanent
contact with the U.S. authorities on investigative developments
into the explosion and the search for possible survivors.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said there were some French nationals on the
aircraft but he was unable to say how many.
</P>
<P>
The Paris-bound TWA Boeing 747 blew up mid-air in a fireball this
morning soon after taking off from the Kennedy international
airport. Rescuers in the Atlantic Ocean off Long Island said there
were no signs of survivors from the 229 people on board.
</P>
<P>
Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris set up a "trauma response
team" made up of police, airport officials and doctors, to comfort
waiting relatives of the French victims.

<HEADLINE> Federal Agencies Mobilize Jet Crash Investigations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 18 (Xinhua) -- U.S. federal agencies have
launched parallel investigations of the Trans World Airlines (TWA)
Boeing 747 jet explosion and crash off the New York coast
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, President Bill Clinton warned this morning against
jumping early conclusion on the cause.
</P>
<P>
While offering condolence to the families and friends of the
victims of the tragedy, Clinton said, "we have no evidence on this
flight that would indicate the cause of the accident." He warned
people against presuming it was a terrorist act.
</P>
<P>
Attorney General Janet Reno said today that two calls claiming
responsibility had been received after the crash, but she said
none had come in before the disaster was reported publicly.
</P>
<P>
An Associated Press report quoted the law enforcement official
as saying investigators "are leaning more towards the possibility
that it was a bomb that caused the plane to explode."
</P>
<P>
The National Transportation Safety Board took over the
investigation of the crash and dispatched a team to the scene
early today under the direction of the agency's vice chairman,
Robert Francis.
</P>
<P>
The FBI opened its own investigation, along with New York City
Police Department terrorism experts
</P>
<P>
"Nothing has been ruled in or ruled out," Safety Board Chairman
Jim Hall said this morning on NBC's "Today."
</P>
<P>
"We will be working jointly with the FBI," he said. "We have in
a number of instances worked with the FBI and other authorities
where there was a thought that a bomb or explosion had occurred
when we found out later that it was not the result of a criminal
act," Hall said on CBS "This Morning."
</P>
<P>
White House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta called two
teleconference calls overnight with agency chiefs involved in the
investigations and planned to hold another meeting to insure that
the federal response has been absolutely sufficient.
</P>
<P>
The Paris-bound flight 800, with 210 passengers and 18 crew
members aboard, exploded and crashed into the Atlantic sea off the
Long Island, about 60 kilometers southeast of New York city,
shortly after taking off from New York's John F. Kennedy
International Airport.
</P>
<P>
Four Coast Guard cutters, six helicopters and a Navy P-3 rescue
plane were battling overnight to try to find any survivers and by
this morning, about 100 dead bodies had been brought ashore.
</P>
<P>
It was the second deadly crash of a U.S. airliner in three
months. On May 11, a ValuJet passenger plane crashed in Florida,
killing all 110 people aboard.

<HEADLINE> Londoners Suffer A Lot By Two Strikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 18 (Xinhua) -- London has been plunged into chaos
today by the total shutdown of its underground network and the
third 24-hour strike by the postal workers.
</P>
<P>
The underground stoppage was the first of a series of nine
planned 24-hour strikes by the 2,200 drivers. An estimated l.6
million passengers were affected.
</P>
<P>
The dispute was expected to cost London Underground more than
l million pounds (l.5 million US dollars) a day in lost revenue
and wages for the rest of its 13,700 staff.
</P>
<P>
The heart of the dispute is not pay. The offer from management
increases that to more than 25,000 pounds (37,500 US dollars) a
year, promising drivers a higher basic wage than their colleagues
driving the advanced Euroster trains under the Channel, according
to the Underground management.
</P>
<P>
The Rail Unions, Aslef and the Rail Maritime and Transport
Unions are seeking a one-hour cut in the 37-hour week. They say
that London Transport made its promise without conditions last
year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more than 130,000 workers at Royal Mail staged their
third 24-hour stoppage today amid mounting speculation that the
Conservatives may include privatization of the postal services in
their election manifesto.
</P>
<P>
The government ruled out the possibility of privatization of
the mail services as the Communication Workers' Union pressed
ahead with an escalating campaign of industrial action in protest
against management's plans to improve efficiency.
</P>
<P>
The 70 million letters posted every day were piled up
undelivered at all the post offices in London today with the
strike being staged by sorting office and delivery workers.
</P>
<P>
The Opposition has become increasingly concerned that the
strikes could damage its standing with the public. David Blunkett,
Labor spokesman on education and employment, declared his backing
for the intervention of an independent arbiter -- a suggestion
made last week by London Underground.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We are in favor of arbitration. We are in favor of
that arbitration being binding, and we think it inappropriate for
the dispute to continue in the light of our proposal."
</P>
<P>
However, the Conservatives are planning to use Labor's
traditional relationship with unions as part of its New Labor, New
Danger campaign.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the impact of the strikes, an official from
London Underground said that everyone would lose: management,
customers and the drivers, who stand to forgo more than 1,000
pounds (1,500 US dollars) each during the campaign.

<HEADLINE> US Fed Chairman Greenspan on US Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 18 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed)
Chairman Alan Greenspan said today that the U.S. economy will slow
down next year and "inflation has remained quiescent."
</P>
<P>
Testing before the Banking Committee of the U.S. Senate, he
predicted that the growth of the U.S. economy, as measured by the
gross domestic product (GDP), will be between 2.5 percent and 2.75
percent this year and decline to between 1.75 percent and 2.25
percent next year.
</P>
<P>
The Fed chairman also forecast that consumer price inflation
will remain between 3 percent and 3.25 percent this year, falling
to between 2.75 percent and 3 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
But Greenspan said the Fed's policy-maker, the Federal Open
Market Committee (FOMC), is determined "to hold the line on
inflation."
</P>
<P>
He is confident that the FOMC will raise interest rates if
necessary to dampen inflation pressures that could threaten
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
"I am confident that the Federal Open Market Committee would
move to tighten reserve market conditions should the weight of
incoming evidence persuasively suggest an oncoming intensification
of inflation pressures that would jeopardize the durability of the
economic expansion," he said.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the comment fits with the widespread
expectation that monetary policy-makers will raise the short-term
interest rates when they meet on August 20.
</P>
<P>
But the cautious Greenspan took pains to leave his options
open, saying "inflation has remained quiescent" and predicting a
slowdown in economic growth that could dampen inflation pressures.
</P>
<P>
The Fed chairman's testimony, accompanying the U.S. Fed's
twice-a-year report to the U.S. Congress on economic and monetary
policy, comes as evidence of surging growth at the end of the
April-June quarter has spooked inflation-wary financial market
traders and sent stock prices gyrating almost daily.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan, 70, was confirmed by the U.S. Senate last month to a
third four-year term of the Fed chairman. During the debate on
his confirmation, he was criticized by some Democrats for being
overly worried about inflation and holding interest rates too
high, damping the economic growth and wage gains in the country.

While declined to confirm the reports, Carrard replied that
"nothing is perfect in the world, but the facts are that we've

"In the first phase, the Iranian-backed Shiite group would
swap the two Israeli soldiers' remains, which are still in
Hezbollah's hand, for the bodies of all the martyrs of the
resistance," he said.
</P>
<P>
"And in the second phase, Hezbollah will release militiamen of
the Israeli client South Lebanon Army captured by the party in
exchange for 200 Lebanese detainees whom the Israeli occupation
authorities will set free," the Hezbollah officer added.
</P>
<P>
However, he did not specify when the exchange would take place.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the negotiations currently underway through a
German delegation also dealt with the problem of Sheikh Abdu
Karim Abeid and Mostafa Dirani, the two high-ranking officers of
Hezbollah who are still being held by the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
But the Hezbollah officer ruled out that the two men would be
released during the operation this time "for a lot of reasons."
</P>
<P>
Abeid and Dirani were kidnapped by Israeli commandos to the
Jewish state from Lebanon separately in 1989 and 1994.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli authorities believed that Dirani possessed critical
informations on the fate of a Israeli air force navigator, Ron
Arad, who went missing when his plane was shot down in southern
Lebanon on October 16, 1886.
</P>
<P>
Six Israeli servicemen were missing in southern Lebanon
between 1982 and 1996 but only Arad is believed to be alive.
</P>
<P>
A five-member German delegation arrived in Beirut Wednesday
night and held meetings today with Lebanese government officials
and Hezbollah officers.
</P>
<P>
Physicians in the German team also examined the remains of the
two Israeli soldiers, who were supposedly identified as Yossi Fink
and Rahaman Alsheikh and who died after their capture by Hezbollah
guerrillas in an ambush in southern Lebanon on February 17, 1986.
</P>
<P>
The German mediators' efforts have received support from Tehran
and Damascus, Lebanese official sources said.

<HEADLINE> US Trade Deficit Shoots Up to Eight-Year High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. trade deficit shot up
to 10.9 billion dollars in May, the largest imbalance in eight
years, according to the Commerce Department here today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that the monthly deficit was 13.2 percent
higher than a revised April deficit of 9.6 billion dollars due to
surging imports of cars and consumer goods such as toys and games
which hit an all-time high. Imports and exports both rose to
record highs, but the 2.6 percent advance in imports surpassed the
1.1 percent gain in American sales abroad.
</P>
<P>
For May, imports of goods and services rose to 80.6 billion
dollars, an increase of 2.04 billion dollars from April. Almost
half of the growth came from an increase of 966 million dollars in
autos and auto parts.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. imported 686 million dollars more of consumer goods
totaling to 14.2 billion dollars in May, led by a jump of 178
million dollars in imports of toys and electronic games.
</P>
<P>
America's foreign oil purchases increased 6.5 percent with
imports of crude oil climbing to 4.6 billion dollars, the highest
level since November 1990. The price per barrel, which had been
rising sharply for two months, declined slightly from 19.33 in
April to 18.95 dollars per barrel, but the volume of imports
increased.
</P>
<P>
On the export side, American sales of goods and services rose
to an all-time high of 69.7 billion dollars with sales of consumer
goods up 136 million dollars, led by household products.
</P>
<P>
The monthly deficit with Japan narrowed dramatically in May,
falling 23.7 percent to 3.13 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
While automotive imports from Japan were up 50 million dollars,
this growth was overshadowed by increases in autos and parts of
303 million dollars from Canada, 148 million dollars from Mexico
and 132 million dollars from Germany.
</P>
<P>
America's trade deficit with Mexico rose 1.7 percent to 1.6
billion dollars as both U.S. exports to Mexico and imports from
the southern neighboring country lifted to record levels.
</P>
<P>
The deficit with Canada, America's northern neighbor and other
partner in the North American Free Trade Agreement, soared 53
percent to 2.5 billion dollars, the largest gap since November
1986.
</P>
<P>
It marked the third straight month the U.S. overall deficit has
worsened and left its trade deficit running at an annual rate of
107.6 billion dollars, exceeding last year's deficit of 105.1
billion dollars that had been the worst showing in seven years.
</P>
<P>
The 10.9 billion dollar May deficit was the worst performance
since the deficit averaged 12.9 billion dollars per month in the
fourth quarter of 1987. At that time, the government only recorded
trade flows in goods and services on a quarterly basis. It started
the monthly reporting of goods and services in 1992.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Accepts Iraq's Distribution Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 18 (Xinhua) -- United Nations
Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali accepted Iraq's food
distribution plan here today, an important step for implementation
of the oil-for-food formula, a U.N. spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
Spokeswoman Sylvana Foa said that Boutros-Ghali and Chinmaya
Gharekhan, chairman of the Steering Committee monitoring the
implementation of the oil-for-food plan, met with Iraqi Ambassador
Abdul Amir al-Anbari at 12:00 today.
</P>
<P>
Gharekhan handed al-Anbari a letter basically approving the
distribution plan, she said.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general said, "We are happy the distribution plan
has been accepted and is in conformity with the Memorandum of
Understanding on May 20."
</P>
<P>
"We hope this will create a new momentum for implementation as
soon as possible of (Security Council) Resolution 986," he said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the 661 committee in charge of
sanctions against Iraq would finish its procedure soon so that
things would start moving.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations imposed economic sanctions, including oil
embargo, on Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait in August 1990. The
long-lasting sanctions have crippled the Iraqi economy and hurt a
whole generation of children in the country. According to a report
of the World Food Program, 4 million or one fifth of the Iraqi
population suffer from severe malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
In order to alleviate the severe humanitarian situation there,
the Security Council adopted Resolution 986 in April 1995,
allowing Iraq to export petroleum worth 2 billion dollars in six
months for import of food and other necessities.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Secretariat and Iraq concluded the
Memorandum of Understanding, which required that Iraq shall submit
the distribution plan to the secretary-general for approval.

process negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Salim was attending a joint consultative meeting here this

the negotiations become," stressed the OAU secretary general.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Lends 21.4 Bln Dlrs for Fiscal 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank today said its
new lending commitments to developing countries totaled 21.4
billion U.S. dollars in fiscal year 1996, which ended on June 30.
</P>
<P>
The figure, which consists of both the market-rate loans made
by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development
(IBRD) and the concessional credits made to the world's poorest
countries through the International Development Association (IDA),
is a slight drop from 22.5 billion dollars in fiscal 1995, but
little higher than 20.8 billion dollars in fiscal 1994.
</P>
<P>
The IBRD loan commitments in fiscal 1996 amounted to 14.5
billion dollars for 129 projects and 6.9 billion dollars in IDA
credits were approved to support 127 projects.
</P>
<P>
The combined IBRD and IDA gross disbursements at the end of
fiscal 1996 were 19.3 billion dollars, up from 18.5 billion
dollars in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
New lending commitments to Africa in the year totaled 2.7
billion dollars, and all of this financing, supporting 53
projects, was in the form of IDA credits as compared with the
combined and totaled lending of 2.3 billion dollars in fiscal
1995. The four single sectors receiving most of the support in the
year were public sector management, transportation, agriculture
and the social sector.
</P>
<P>
The East Asia and Pacific region received over 5.4 billion
dollars in new lending commitments, 4.25 billion dollars for the
IBRD and 1.16 billion dollars for the IDA as against the combined
6 billion dollars in fiscal 1995.
</P>
<P>
In South Asia, 3 billion dollars in new commitments were
approved in fiscal 1996, of this 1.2 billion dollars was from the
IBRD and 1.8 billion dollars was from the IDA. The figure is
virtually unchanged from the fiscal 1995 combined lending to the
region.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank commitments to Latin America and the Caribbean
in fiscal 1996 totaled 4.4 billion dollars. One-fourth of the
total lending to the region, roughly 1.1 billion dollars, went to
back efforts in population, health, and nutrition. Loans to the
region in fiscal 1995 were over 6 billion dollars, largely due to
loans to soften the efforts of the economic crisis in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
The countries of Europe and Central Asia saw 61 projects
totaling 4.2 billion dollars approved in fiscal 1996 as against
the combined total lending of 4.5 billion dollars for 58 projects
in fiscal 1995.
</P>
<P>
New commitments to the countries of the Middle East and North
Africa in fiscal 1996 amounted to 1.6 billion dollars, up from 979
million dollars in the previous year, which represents 61 percent
increase.
</P>
<P>
Among the top 10 borrowers in the year include China with 2.97
billion dollars, India 2.077 billion dollars, Russia 1.816 billion
dollars and Indonesia 1.509 billion dollars. For the first time,
Vietnam is one of the World Bank's top 10 borrowers for the fiscal
year, with support totaling 502 million dollars. But India was the
largest recipient of IDA credits in fiscal 1996, with 1.3 billion
dollars for nine projects.

LUSAKA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's individual farmers have
been urged to form marketing associations in a bid to sell the
crops at good prices.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest Food Security Bulletin available here
today, the farmers are selling their crops at very low prices
partly due to lack of price references.
</P>
<P>
With the formation of the associations, the weekly Marketing
Bulletin published by the Zambia National Farmers Union (ZNFU)
can be easily available on the prevailing buying prices, the
bulletin said.
</P>
<P>
Thereby, farmers can sell their crops only when the prices are
high.
</P>
<P>
The associations may also help obtain inputs more cheaply than
on an individual basis.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that some Zambian farmers are selling their
maize very cheaply partly due to lack of price information.

MOSCOW, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Russia's Presidential Political
Consultative Council held its first session and formed its
leadership today, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Ivan Rybkin, former State Duma (lower house of parliament)
speaker, was named by President Boris Yeltsin as chairman of the
council.
</P>
<P>
He will have among his deputies Vladimir Zhirinovsky, leader
of the Liberal Democratic Party, Sergei Shakhrai, leader of the
Party of Russian Unity and Accord, Yekaterina Lakhova, leader of
the Women of Russia, and Boris Fyodorov, leader of Forward Russia.
</P>
<P>
Three seats of the council deputy chairman were reserved for
Our Home Is Russia, Yabloko bloc and the Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
A number of the heads of the council chambers were also named.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the session, Rybkin explained that the council was
formed because the president was concerned about the interests of
almost 40 million voters who are not represented in the Duma, as
in last December's elections they cast their ballots for parties
and movements that did not clear the 5-percent barrier.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the main purpose of the council is to examine
drafts of laws, presidential decrees and government resolutions.

WASHINGTON, July 18 (Xinhua) -- A senior U.S. official will
leave for the Middle East this weekend to explore possible
"openings" in Arab-Israeli negotiations, said U.S. officials
today.
</P>
<P>
Dennis Rose, special coordinator for Mideast peace talks, was
dispatched by Secretary of State Warren Christopher as there have
emerged possible "openings" since President Bill Clinton held
talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White
House last week, they said.
</P>
<P>
Rose said he will offer Arab leaders with "more thorough
briefings" on those discussions between Clinton and Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
But Rose said he does not expect to come away from his mission
with an agreement that Israel and Syria will resume peace talks or
any concessions from Netanyahu on implementing the interim accord
with the Palestinians that had beed agreed upon by the former
Labor government of Israel.
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of this trip is to go out and deal with the
leaders of a number of countries in the aftermath of the prime
minister's visit here," Rose said. "These are consultations more
than anything else."
</P>
<P>
"We want to find the best possible way to move forward," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Rose declined to detail his itinerary, but U.S. and Middle
Eastern officials said he would depart Sunday for the one-week
mission, and planned to met with Netanyahu in Israel, Palestinian
Leader Yasser Arafat in the West Bank or in the Gaza Strip, King
Hussein in Jordan, President Hafez Assad in Syria and President
Hosni Mubarak in Egypt.

<HEADLINE> Fish Species Vanish In Lake Victoria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Some 22 fish species native
to Lake Victoria have become extinct while 150 others are
endangered, due mainly to the voracious Nile Perch and
overfishing.
</P>
<P>
Janet Abramovitz, a fresh water ecologist said in her study
issued here today that so far 20 percent of the lake's fish
species have become extinct due to overfishing, pollution and the
Nile Perch that devours the lesser species.
</P>
<P>
The Nile Perch, growing up to 200 kilograms and two meters
tall, was introduced to the lake 42 years ago, but has decimated
most of the native fish, according to the study.
</P>
<P>
A fresh water zoologist who also studies the Lake Victoria
fish called the trend the "first mass extinction of vertebrates
that scientists have had the opportunity to observe."
</P>
<P>
He told reporters recently that in 1979, an average of 0.5
kilogram of the perch was found in a hectare of the lake but now
more than 70 kilograms of the fish are in a hectare.
</P>
<P>
He said, unlike other species harmed by the pollution, the
perch is reproducing inexorably, further robbing the lake of its
once plentiful native fish.

<HEADLINE> Clinton's Videotaped Testimony Played </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Lawyers in a Whitewater-related
trial Thursday played U.S. President Bill Clinton's videotaped
testimony in defense of two of his political supporters in
Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
The playing of the edited version of Clinton's deposition, made
on July 7 at the White House, was delayed for a day by the lengthy
examination of Bruce Lindsey, one of Clinton's closest aides.
</P>
<P>
The written transcript of the deposition will be released after
the showing of the video in court, but the presiding judge has
ordered the tape kept under seal, according to an Associated Press
report.
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyer Dan Guthrie said he anticipated the videotaped
testimony to rebut charges that bankers Herby Branscum Jr. and
Robert M. Hill broke the law in the early 1990s by dipping into
bank funds to curry political favor with Clinton, then Arkansas
governor.
</P>
<P>
The owners of Perry County Bank are accused of misapplying bank
funds to reimburse contributions to Clinton and other politicians.
They also are charged with concealing from the Internal Revenue
Service 52,500 dollars in cash withdrawals by the 1990 Clinton for
Governor campaign.
</P>
<P>
Lindsey ended his testimony Wednesday. Outside the courthouse,
Lindsey said his two days of testimony showed that Clinton's 1990
campaign "properly reported all of its campaign contributions and
expenditures."
</P>
<P>
He said money from two large cash withdrawals, which he
testified went for get-out-the-vote activities, was "entirely
proper and legal and... properly reported."

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Appoints New ECOMOG Field Commander </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government announced
today the appointment of Major-General Victor Malu as new field
commander of ECOMOG, which is the peacekeeping force of the
Economic Community of West African States now operating in
Liberia.
</P>
<P>
Major-General Malu succeeds Major-General John Inienger, also
a Nigerian general whose tenure of duty expired this month, the
army said in a statement here today.
</P>
<P>
Until his new appointment, Major-General Malu was the general
officer commanding 82 division of the army in Enugu State,
southeastern Nigeria, and a member of the Provisional Ruling
Council, the most powerful organ in the country.
</P>
<P>
The new ECOMOG boss, who was promoted to the rank of major
general early this week, has earlier served as ECOMOG chief of
staff in 1992 and 1993 when ECOMOG successfully repelled an
intense attack from the National Patriotic Front of Liberia of
Charles Taylor.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG was set up in August 1990 and six Nigerian generals
have served as its field commander before Major-General Malu. One
of the past field commanders Major-General Rufus Kupolati is
currently commanding a United Nations peace mission in Jerusalem,
Israel, according to the News Agency of Nigeria.

and took control of 37 percent of the island following a
short-lived Greek Cypriot coup seeking union with Greece.

ATLANTA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Though the Burkina Faso's athletes
have no chances of winning any medals at the Atlanta Olympics,
they still want to try their best, said Nacro Nahanra, Chef de
Mission of the country's Olympic delegation, on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"It is so nice for a small country like Burkina Faso to come
here for the Olympic Games," Nahanra told Xinhua after a
flag-raising ceremony at the Olympic Village.
</P>
<P>
"We have no chances of getting a medal but we will do our best
to gain a result as good as possible. We hope some of our
athletes can set their own best marks and break our national
records," the chef de Mission added.
</P>
<P>
In 1972, Burkina Faso made its Olympic debut, and won the best
result of eighth place in the men's long jump in the 1988
Olympics. This time the western African country sends a total of
16 athletes to take part in boxing and athletics.

The 25-year-old Franck finished 10th in the men's long jump at
last year's world championships.
</P>
<P>
"I dream to become a world top long jumper and our country's
first medalist in the major world competition. I know it's hard

JERUSALEM, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister David
Levy sent condolences to U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher today over the death of 228 people on board of a TWA
jumbo jet which crashed.
</P>
<P>
Levy said that Israel was horrified by the crash, which he
feared was caused by "sabotage."
</P>
<P>
"A worldwide effort should be made to redouble efforts to
bring such tragedy to an end, if it is established that it was the
result of a terrorist act," he added.
</P>
<P>
The TWA 800 flight, abound from New York to Paris, exploded
Wednesday night shortly after it took off from J. Kennedy
Airport in New York.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio quoted a TWA spokesman as saying that the flight
has originally flied from New York via Paris to Tel Aviv until
January when the Israeli leg discontinued.
</P>
<P>
The report said that a 29-year old Israeli man was believed on
the flight, but his name remained unclear.
</P>
<P>
The radio also reported that a man identified himself as a
member of Jihad, an anti-Israeli Islamic extremist group opposed
to the Israeli-Arab peace, telephoned a TV station in Florida to
claim responsibility for the explosion.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.S. government has so far declined to jump to
any conclusion before it can get solid evidences.
</P>
<P>
Jihad has been engaging in anti-Israeli terrorist attacks and
is responsible for one of the four suicide bombing inside Israel
from late February to early March this year, which killed 58
people.

<HEADLINE> Japan Confident to Win Olympic Swimming Medals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Japan, the Asian swimming
powerhouse, is going to launch a huge Olympic medal haul in the
pool at the forthcoming Centennial Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Tsutomu Hayashi, leader of the Japanese swimming squad, said
that this time would be their "best shot at the Olympic Games."
</P>
<P>
"We would give everything that we have." he said.
</P>
<P>
All members of the Japanese swimming team are living in the
Olympic Villiage and began their training here this morning.
</P>
<P>
Head coach Toshiaki Nomoto said, "Some of my athletes seem a
little bit neverous while most of the teammembers are quiet
relaxed."
</P>
<P>
He added that the swimmers were metally ready for the big
clash. "And there are no injury and disease problems in our team."
</P>
<P>
"Under normal circumstances, we would score good results in the
Olympics." the head coach said. "The training times for most of
the swimmers are pretty good, faster than the training time in
Japan."
</P>
<P>
Japan burst onto the international scene in the pool, specially
in the women's butterfly events.
</P>
<P>
Ayari Aoyama, 14, a raw junior high school student, clocked
58.83 second, the year's best time, in the women's 100m butterfly
at the Japanese Olympic trials in May.
</P>
<P>
However, her coach Koichi Fujino said that she still didn't
find her form and only put up a mediocre performance in recent
training.
</P>
<P>
"But I do not give her too much advice. I just let her relaxed
and make her control the situation by herself."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, her teammate Hitomi Kashima also clocked the year's
best of 2:08.09 in the 200m butterfly, boosting Japan's Olympic
gold medal hope.
</P>
<P>
Japan also has advantage in some other events. Defending
champion in the 200m breaststroke Kyoko Iwasaki is favored to add
one more medal to her credit.
</P>
<P>
"She is in her form now," said her coach Ryuichiro Mizuno. "The
pool here is nice and her stroke and kick is quite good, and I
think she will be better and better."
</P>
<P>
"She is metally stable and her experience at the last Olympics
will be of much help to her this time," he added.
</P>
<P>
Iwasaki, a "dark horse" in the pool at Barcelona, collected
Japan's only gold in the pool four years ago.
</P>
<P>
Suzu Chiba, the Pan Pacific gold medalist here last year, is
also expected to take another crown for her country, in the
women's 200m freestyle.
</P>
<P>
"She has successfully passed the trials and other international
competitions. So I think she also could deal with the pressure
though this time it is the Olympics," said her coach Matsuda.
</P>
<P>
Backstroke Miki Nakao, second-ranked in the 200m behind
Krisztina Egerszegi of Hungary, is also a Japanese hopeful for an
Olympic medal in the pool.
</P>
<P>
Yoshinobu Miyazaki, one of Japan's male swimmers, said: "I'm a
secret weapon of the Japanese team." In fact, the Japanese squad
has too many "underdogs" to make an impact at the Georgia Tech
University Acuatic Center in coming days.
</P>
<P>
The head coach said that women's butterfly is the most hopeful
Olympic medal event for them while he tipped the Chinese as their
most serious rivals.

</P>
<P>
Al-Hasad, who is under instruction of a Chinese coach in
Kuwait, hopes he could reach the semi-final at the games.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Registration of Bosnia Refugee Voters to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The registration of refugees who
have the right to vote in Bosnia's elections scheduled for
september 14 will begin in Yugoslavia next Monday.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia will open 8,000 registration stations for refugees
who want to register to vote, head of the Yugoslav government
commission for participation of refugees in the elections,
Bratislava Morina, said today.
</P>
<P>
Morina said the refugees' massive participation in Bosnia's
first democratic elections would make it possible to build a
lasting peace there and secure the future for the Bosnian Serb
state Republika Srpska.
</P>
<P>
All refugees sheltering in Yugoslavia who were registered as
Bosnia's citizens in the 1991 census have the right to vote,
Vladimir Cucic, the commission's secretary, added.
</P>
<P>
About 50,000 refugees who have fled the Republic of Serb
Krajina in Croatia can vote in the Republika Srpska, but have to
register first and vote personally in a Serb municipality they
choose.
</P>
<P>
Serbs in Croatia proclaimed their own state, the Republic of
Serb Krajina, in 1991, after Croatia launched a war of secession
from the former Yugoslavia. But most of the Krajina Serbs fled
their home in 1995 into Yugoslavia when the Croatian government
forces overran the Serb-held areas.
</P>
<P>
Cucic said it was up to the 150,000 refugees from Bosnia to
decide whether to vote in Yugoslavia or return to Bosnia and vote
there.
</P>
<P>
The recent registration of refugees has shown that about
200,000 refugees from Bosnia-Herzegovina and Serb Krajina with the
right to vote have taken shelter in Serbia, and another 15,000 in
Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
Refugees who have fled areas currently under control of the
Muslim-Croat federation and want to vote for federation candidates
can do so in Yugoslavia. However, if they want to vote for
Republika Srpska candidates, they have to vote in a Serb
municipality they choose, Cucic added.
</P>
<P>
The first post-war elections are regarded as a crucial step
toward peace and stability in Bosnia. The election campaign,
previously planned on July 15, will begin on Friday.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Drafts Agreement with IFOR over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The Yugoslav government drafted
an agreement today with the peace Implementation Force (IFOR) in
Bosnia on the use of Yugoslav air space to back the U.N.
Transitional Administration for eastern Slavonia (UNTAES).
</P>
<P>
The agreement adopted at a session, presided by Yugoslav Prime
Minister Radoje Kontic, regulates technical questions of
implementing the peace agreement, the Yugoslav Information
Secretariat said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, IFOR can use the Yugoslav air space in
case of need for air support to the UNTAES in the Eastern Slavonia
region, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
Eastern Slavonia is located in northeastern Croatia bordering
Yugoslavia with a majority of Serb population. Under an agreement
signed in November 1995 between the Croatian government and the
Serb community leaders in Eastern Slavonia, the region was placed
under U.N. Transitional Administration for one year, with the
possibility of extending the mandate for another year.
</P>
<P>
Eastern Slavonia is the only one of the four regions of the
Republic of Serb Krajina which had not been occupied by Croatian
government forces during their offensives in May and August, 1995.

<P>
ATLANTA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The 26th Summer Olympic Games will
begin their 17-day run for glory late Friday in a hot climate in
the America's Deep South city of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
More than 10,000 athletes from 197 countries have answered the
Olympian call to assemble every four years on playing fields and
in arenas to vie for laurels and national prestige. The games will
be the biggest, costliest and most commercialized in history.
</P>
<P>
"`The town has been prepped. The athletes are here. The fans
have tickets. And the rest of the world is waiting by the
television. Today, Atlanta is an Olympic city," the Atlanta
Journal-Constitution newspaper said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We are in, literally, for the ride of our lives over the next
several weeks," said Billy Payne, president of the the Atlanta
organizing committee.
</P>
<P>
The inaugural ceremony is scheduled to start at 8:30 p.m. local
time (0030 GMT) and last almost four hours.
</P>
<P>
The program included big-name singers' song and the Atlanta
Symphony Orchestra and a 300-strong Centennial Choir.
</P>
<P>
Organizers worked hard to keep elements of the opening ceremony
under wraps until Friday night, including the method to be used for
the climactic lighting of the stadium cauldron with the Olympic
torch.
</P>
<P>
According to the organizers, the lighting of the Olympic torch,
one of the most exciting things at the opening ceremony, will be
"sometimes simplicity is the easiest."

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus and Russia will sign a new
agreement on legal cooperation which will include the transfer of
convicts from one country to the other.
</P>
<P>
This was announced here today by Cyprus Justice and Public
Order Minister Alecos Evangelou following his meeting with the
visiting Russian Attorney General Yuri Skouratov.
</P>
<P>
Evangelou said a number of issues of common interest were
discussed at the meeting and particularly the need to reform the
existing agreement on legal cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot Minister of Justice said his Russian counterpart
will visit the island in September to sign the new, revised
agreement on legal cooperation issues.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the new agreement will cover the transfer of
convicts from one country to the other as well as issues
resulting from internal changes in Russia.
</P>
<P>
On his part, the Russian Attorney General, who arrived here
Wednesday on an official visit, said that there is an exchange of
information between the two countries concerning persons involved
in illegal activities.
</P>
<P>
Skouratov said that Russian authorities have implemented a new
plan to combat drug-related crimes and scored a number of
successes recently against the crime.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that fighting crime in Russia contributes to
fighting criminal activities committed by Russian nationals in
Cyprus," the official added.

<HEADLINE> Jupiter's Moon May Have An Ocean with Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BIRMINGHAM (U.K.) July 19 (Xinhua) -- Europa, one of Jupiter's
largest moons, may have an ocean under its icy layer, an American
scientist reported here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It may contain a life bearing environment quite different from
our own, Professor Steven Squyres from Cornell University told
the 31st assembly of the Committee for Space Research being held
at England's University of Birmingham this week.
</P>
<P>
The professor said he based his claim on evidence from an
analysis of the Voyager spacecraft images.
</P>
<P>
The pictures showed a smooth surface, nearly devoid of the
craters seen on Jupiter's other ice moons, but crisscrossed with a
lattice of fractures strikingly similar to the ridges seen on
Antarctic ice.
</P>
<P>
Squyres conjured up a scenario similar to one from an Arthur C
Clarke novel, where the icy moon was in a continual tug of war
between the gravity of Jupiter, and Io and Ganymede - two other
moons of Jupiter.
</P>
<P>
The friction from the tidal forces heats the planet and keeps
the water liquid about a rocky core under the ice.
</P>
<P>
Research suggested the liquid might be up to 65 miles thick in
places, full of organic compounds and salts, making it one of the
most promising places in the solar system beyond the Earth to
search for life, even though it would be blocked from life-giving
sunlight.
</P>
<P>
Squyres speculated that biological activity might instead be
powered by geothermal heat at the center of the planet - much like
thermophilic, heat-loving bacteria and isolated biological
communities recently discovered near submarine volcanos on Earth.
</P>
<P>
It is hoped that data coming from the Galileo space probe in
the next month will yield clues as to the presence of an ocean on
Europa - perhaps even detecting geyser - like eruptions from an
ocean below the ice.
</P>
<P>
A radio astronomer appealed at the meeting for the
establishment of a crater reservation on the far side of the Moon
-- a lunar equivalent of a national park -- to help in the search
for alien life.

<HEADLINE> IMF to Loan Kazakhstan 400 Million U.S. Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) has decided to provide Kazakhstan with a 400 million
U.S. dollars loan to help the country's mid-term economic reform
program, Deputy Prime Minister Viktor Sobolev said here today.
</P>
<P>
The IMF approved the loan at a Board of Governors' meeting on
Wednesday after reviewing the credit policy, budget and tax policy
of Kazakhstan, Sobolev said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting welcomed the fact that Kazakhstan had started the
1996-1998 mid-term economic program co-designed by Kazakhstan and
the IMF.
</P>
<P>
Sobolev said the Finance Ministry and the State Bank of
Kazakhstan would strictly supervise the use of the loan.
</P>
<P>
He said the government and the State Bank had worked out a
financial and economic program for the period aimed at paving the
way for achieving steady economic growth and higher living
standards.
</P>
<P>
Between 1992 and 1995, the IMF provided a total of 650 million
dollars in loans to Kazakhstan. Negotiation on the latest loan
began at the beginning of this year.

<HEADLINE> China's Agriculture Sector Looks Good In First Half of Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 19 (Xinhua) -- China's summer harvest has been
good this year, and grain production for the whole year looks the
same, according to a national meeting on agriculture here.
</P>
<P>
Total summer grain production hit a record high, with 16
provinces and municipalities having increased production, mainly
because of increased use of new technology.
</P>
<P>
Livestock production has kept growing fast. According to
statistics of 14 provinces, total output of pork, mutton, and beef
reached 14 million tons in the first half of the year, an increase
of 15.9 percent over the same period last year. Aquatic products
output from January to May reached 7.23 million ton, a rise of
16.7 percent over last year.
</P>
<P>
Township enterprises have also performed well, with added value
hitting 354 billion yuan (40.7 billion US dollars), an increase of
25.1 percent over the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the State Statistics Bureau, the actual half-year
per capita income of peasants, when adjusted for inflation, has
increased by 11 percent over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
"The key to a good harvest for the whole year lies in the
production of the latter half. All officials and technicians in
the agricultural sector should deal with concrete matters relating
to work and try their best to meet the goals of the whole year,"
said Liu Jiang, minister of agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that the industrialization of agriculture is a major
undertaking, which synchronizes the development of seeding,
breeding, processing, transportation, and selling. Agricultural
departments at various levels should promote this development.

<HEADLINE> Japan Stresses Need for U.S. Military Cut in Okinawa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Japan's Defense Agency published an
annual report today emphasizing the need for a cut in the
U.S. military presence in the southwestern island prefecture of
Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
However, the report did not mention details of an ongoing
dispute over an Okinawa landowner's request for the return of his
land in the U.S. Sobe communications facility, in the village of
Yomitan.
</P>
<P>
The Okinawa landowner, Shoichi Chibana, 47, will file a lawsuit
next week against the Japanese government, demanding the return of
a 236-square-meter plot within the Sobe facility, reports say.
</P>
<P>
Although the lease of the land expired at the end of March, the
Japanese government allowed the U.S. forces to continue with the
use of it without any clear legal basis.
</P>
<P>
After Okinawa Governor Masahide Ota refused to sign documents
needed for continued renting of the land, the central government
filed a suit against him and the first hearing was scheduled for
July 29.
</P>
<P>
The local people in Okinawa have been outraged by the long-term
presence of the U.S. military which occupies about 75 percent of
the island land. The resentment against the U.S. forces has grown
since the rape of a local schoolgirl by three U.S. servicemen last
September.
</P>
<P>
In April, the United States agreed to return some 20 percent of
the land it occupies in Okinawa Prefecture to the local landowners.
</P>
<P>
The annual report also warned that "opaque and uncertain
factors" remained in the Asia-Pacific region.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Israeli soldiers today shot in
the air to disperse Palestinian protesters and Jewish settlers who
clashed in West Bank over a land dispute.
</P>
<P>
About 100 Palestinian villagers living near the Schillo
settlements, south of Nablus, this morning stoned settlers, tore
down barb fences and destroyed crops to protest what they called
illegal land confiscation by the Jewish settlers.
</P>
<P>
Two dozens of Jewish settlers mobilized immediately to
confront the stone-throwing Palestinian protesters. Armed settlers
fired in the air, trying to scare off the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Several Palestinians were injured in the clash, including
three Palestinian cameramen hired by foreign news organs, one of
whom was hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
The clash was later thwarted by a dozen of Israeli soldiers who
rushed to the scene to disperse the protesters by shooting in the
air.
</P>
<P>
This is the first major violent confrontation between
Palestinians and Jewish settlers in the territories since
Israel's hardline Likud government took power in May 29
elections.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has promised to
expand the Jewish settlements in the Palestinian territories, a
move expected to lead to the revival of Palestinian violence.
</P>
<P>
The construction of Jewish settlements, the hot-bed of
violent clashes, was frozen by previous Israeli government led
by Shimon Peres, chief architect of the Israeli-Arab peace
process based on the principle of land-for-peace.

WASHINGTON, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news

</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- With the intense and gruesome search for survivors amid the
wreckage of TWA Flight 800 turning up only charred bodies in the
ocean, federal officials Thursday launched a massive investigation
into the cause of the disaster, including the possibility it was
an act of sabotage.
</P>
<P>
-- The House Thursday adopted the most comprehensive overhaul
of the nation's welfare programs in six decades, endorsing
legislation that would end the guarantee of federal aid to the
poor and turn control of public assistance programs over to the
state.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The leaders of Israel and Egypt met in talks that resulted
in clearing the air but offered little sign of progress toward
bridging the rifts that divide the Arab world and the new Israeli
Government.
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton is carefully entwining the presidency with
the Olympics, even more tightly than when Ronald Reagan did.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Clinton denied giving two bankers state posts in exchange
for campaign contributions while he was Arkansas governor. The
videotaped testimony came in the trial of the bankers on charges
brought by the Whitewater prosecutor.

visitors.
</P>
<P>
But some of the Olympic visitors were not so confident about

<P>
HARARE, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Smallholder farmers, who
constitute the bulk of the food producers in the 12-member
Southern African Development Community (SADC), will meet here on
Monday to discuss ways of improving productivity.
</P>
<P>
The regional week-long workshop on agri-inputs, marketing and
extension in Africa, to be held in Harare, will look at the
correct use of crop chemicals, soil fertility management and
marketing of produce.
</P>
<P>
Production of maize, which is the staple food in most
countries in the region, rose by 72 percent from last year's
11.27 million tons to 19.44 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Smallholder farmers or peasants are presently faced with
serious operational problems, which include inadequate access to
capital finance to enable them to acquire the necessary inputs.
</P>
<P>
Organizers of the workshop, the African center for fertilizer
development said today there is an urgent need to conscientize
farmers of the benefits of using fertilizer to increase
productivity.
</P>
<P>
''The availability of the right inputs at the right time,
right place and right price is a major bottleneck in the small

GENEVA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- At least 15,000 people have died
this year from among more than 140,000 cases in a recurring cycle

The belt stretches from Ethiopia in the east to Senegal on the
west coast, covering 18 countries. According to WHO, Burkina Faso,
Chad, Mali, Niger and Nigeria were the countries hardest hit in
the 1996 epidemic.
</P>
<P>
Sudan, Morocco and Egypt have also experienced serious
outbreaks this year.
</P>
<P>
The epidemics recur once every eight to 12 years during the dry
season in the meningitis belt in this region, but in some
countries the intervals have shortened and become more irregular
since 1980s.
</P>
<P>
In any one country, the epidemics could last for two to three
consecutive years, WHO said.
</P>
<P>
The global public health body said it had launched this week a
major initiative to control the recurrence of the disease in
Africa, and was seeking strengthened national and regional health
systems.
</P>
<P>
WHO said it would work with international partners and
governments over the next three years in the region to enable
affected countries to identify epidemics at their outset, take
timely preventive measures to reduce spread of the disease and
provide rapid treatment of cases.
</P>
<P>
Among the efforts would be the building of contingency stocks
of vaccine at regional levels for the 18 countries in the belt,
and emergency stocks of 100,000 doses at national levels.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Refuses to Leave Cyprus Prison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- A Palestinian, who had been
jailed for a bomb attack, was released from Nicosia prison
Thursday, but he refused to leave the prison, citing personal
security reasons.
</P>
<P>
Omar Ahmad Hawillo, 36, was convicted in 1988 to 15 years
imprisonment after being found guilty of taking part in the
most terrible ever terrorist bomb attack in Cyprus in the
morning of May 11, 1988.
</P>
<P>
Hawillo triggered a booby-trapped car driven by a fellow
Palestinian, who failed to park the car outside the Israeli
embassy. The bomb exploded on a central bridge, some 200 meters
away from the heavily-guarded embassy building, killing the
driver and two Greek Cypriots, wounding 17 others.
</P>
<P>
George Anastasiades, Nicosia-based central prisons Director,
told the press today that Hawillo was among 42 prisoners released
Thursday due to overcrowding in Nicosia prison, which only has
rooms for 220 prisoners.
</P>
<P>
He said Hawillo served only 8 years and 3 months from
his 15-year sentence. The Palestinian received several presidential
pardons. His sentence was also reduced because of his good
behavior in jail.
</P>
<P>
However, Hawillo refused to leave the island, expressing
fears about his personal security.
</P>
<P>
According to the director, Hawillo has applied for a Syrian
passport, hoping it will enable him to travel to an Arab
country.

<HEADLINE> New Software Developed in Britain to Avoid Pornography </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 19 (Xinhua) - A group at Britain's prestigious
Cambridge University has developed new software to screen out
pornography on Internet.
</P>
<P>
The software "intelligent search agents" are said by the
developer, Autonomy, to be the world's first commercially
available search agents. The software was designed to screen out
pornographic materials by applying artificial intelligence to
data-searching.
</P>
<P>
Since the software can roam across the Internet to search, and
understand the client's needs and tastes, it is seen as the final
piece of technology needed to create personalized newspapers on
Internet.
</P>
<P>
What makes a search agent different from "search engines" used
to find Internet information is its ability to learn. Through
training, the agent learns more and more about its user's tastes,
and responds accordingly.
</P>
<P>
Various agents will be available, some designed for specific
purposes such as searching newspaper files or sifting junk from
e-mail.

<P>
CHANGSHA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Five million civilians and
soldiers have been taking part in the fight against rising water
in central China's Hunan Province, it was learned here today.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that 500 inflatable boats, 3,000 life preservers,
and 2,000 lifebuoys have been delivered to Changsha, capital of
Hunan, for relief work. Military aircraft have been used for
dropping relief materials since July 17.
</P>
<P>
The PLA soldiers, armed police, and local police have joined
local people in dealing with 20,000 dangerous situations. A
pontoon bridge group was sent to help rescue people who were
stranded by flooding, sources said.
</P>
<P>
A group sent by the Party Central Committee and the State
Council arrived at the disaster-stricken area on the evening of
July 17 and began directing the operation.
</P>
<P>
Sources say that heavy rains have pushed the Yangtze River in
the region to 2.5 meters above the danger mark.
</P>
<P>
The Zishui and Yuanshui, both tributaries of the Yangtze in
Hunan, have experienced their highest flood waters in 30 years,
with the Zishui setting a record of 46.9 meters at two a.m. today.
</P>
<P>
Dongting Lake, China's biggest fresh water lake, which is on
the middle reaches of the Yangtze in Hunan, is also overflowing,
but with its level still rising. The lake's water level went above
the danger level of 32 meters on July 2.
</P>
<P>
Flood disasters have been occurring since late June when heavy
rains started to fall. The floods had claimed at least 716 lives
by July 18, an official of the Ministry of Civil Affairs said
today.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Communist Party Central Committee and the State
Council held a meeting on the situation today, at which President

<HEADLINE> State Councillor Calls for Improved Rural Medical Conditions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 19 (Xinhua) -- State Councillor Peng Peiyun said
here today that medical care in rural regions must be improved and
she encouraged farmers to put more investment into it.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a national meeting on rural medical care, Peng said
that the country will see that every Chinese has basic medical
care by the year 2000, and that the key to achieving this is to
provide adequate medical services for farmers, who account for 80
percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
When farmers go to see doctors, it's at their own cost, unlike
many urbanities whose medical fees are covered by the
state. Therefore, according to Peng, development of a co-operative
medical system should be encouraged, one that requires farmers to
help each other and invest money voluntarily in building rural
medical facilities.
</P>
<P>
At present, only 10 percent of China's farmers are involved in
the system, Peng pointed out.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Meets With Cambodia's Second Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng said here
today that China will attach no political conditions to its
support for Cambodia nor to co-operation with the country.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Cambodia's Second Prime Minister Hun Sen
this afternoon, the two leaders exchanged views on bilateral
relations and other issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
Li said that Hun's visit to China will help increase
understanding between the two countries' people and strengthen
co-operation.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders expressed satisfaction with the bilateral ties
since the establishment of the Cambodian government. They agreed
that further relations are the common aspiration and in the basic
interest of the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that these will benefit regional peace, stability
and development if they are based on the Five Principles of
Peaceful Co-Existence, namely, mutual respect for sovereignty and
territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression, non-interference in
each other's internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and
peaceful co-existence.
</P>
<P>
Hun expressed his pleasure at seeing Li again and said that
over the past few years, the Cambodian government and people have
made achievements in restoring and reconstructing the nation,
while developing the economy. Agriculture, transportation, the
power industry, and personnel training have been put high on the
development list.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Cambodia welcomes Chinese enterprises to make
economic and trade contacts there, and expressing the hope that
his visit will reinforce co-operation in the economy, trade,
technology, and culture.
</P>
<P>
Li extended his congratulations on the achievements Cambodia
has made under the leadership of King Norodom Sihanouk since its
national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
As a close neighbor of Cambodia, China stresses the development
of relations between the two nations and respect Cambodia's right
to choose its own social system and mode of development, Li
noted. He expressed the hope that Cambodia can enjoy political
stability, national unity, and a growing economy.
</P>
<P>
Li pointed out that co-operative projects should be set up in a
specific way and should develop gradually. China will attach no
conditions to economic support or economic co-operation between
the two nations, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Li said that, with the end of the cold war, the world has
become more relaxed, but that there are still many factors of
instability and that it is necessary to establish a new world
political and economic order.
</P>
<P>
China believes that all countries, big or small, strong or
weak, rich or poor, are members of the international community and
are qualified to contribute to national and world peace and
development, Li said, and that every country has the right to
choose its own mode of development and ideology based on its
national conditions, and that no country can interfere.
</P>
<P>
Hun said that the Cambodian government will stick to the "One
China" policy, recognize the Chinese government as the sole and
legitimate government representing the whole of China, and Taiwan
as an inalienable part of China. Cambodia will not have any
official relations with Taiwan, and believes that the Tibet issue
is entirely China's internal affairs. Li expressed his
appreciation for this.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Li and Hun attended a signing ceremony of a
trade agreement and an agreement on the promotion and protection
of investment between the two governments.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Li Shuzheng, head of the International Liaison
Department of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee, also
met with Hun Sen and his entourage.

<HEADLINE> Another Ship Hijacked by Somali Gunmen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The hijackers of Farah Omar
fishing vessel said they have captured another ship owned by the
same company yesterday from the Red Sea.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the hijackers at Igo beach, 350 kms north of
the capital said the second ship, 21-October-3, reached at shore
off Igo beach late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman who refused to be named told reporters through
VHF field radios that his group will not release the two ships
unless they are given "contract termination severance" or ransom
although they did not figure it out.
</P>
<P>
He also declined to say what nationalities of the crew members
of the second ship are. However, he said they will be treated
well during their captivity.
</P>
<P>
The local authorities in Elder town, capital of Igo beach have
confirmed the hijack of the second ship. October 21 was a
national day for Somalia in the past because Mohamed Siad Barre
came into power on that date.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations are said to be going on between the hijackers and
representatives from the manager of the ships, Mr Said Omar Munye
who is now in Taiz, Yemen.
</P>
<P>
The north Mogadishu authorities have also declined to comment
on the increasing hijacking incidents of the fishing vessels in
the Somalia's waters controlled by faction leader Ali Mahdi
Mohamed.
</P>
<P>
Ali Mahdi this morning declined to comment on the stalemated
situation of the hijacked ships. On July 12, Somali gunmen
hijacked a fishing vessel at the same Igo beach.
</P>
<P>
The hijackers from the Abgal clan of Ali Mahdi were reportedly
annoyed by a contract termination forwarded to some of their
co-workers on board the vessel by the ship administration.
</P>
<P>
Among the estimated 37 people on board the vessel, 5-7
foreigners from Tanzania, Italy and Portugal are the crew members
of the ship.
</P>
<P>
An Italian relief agency, CISP, based in north Mogadishu is
also reported to be directly involved in the negotiations, but so
far no progress has been made.
</P>
<P>
The two hijacked ships and other three ones had been used by
members from the former port authority of Somalia's late regime
who maintain good relations with Italian companies ever since the
late regime of Mohamed Siad Barre was overthrown by Somali
gunmen.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in 1993, the same ship Farah Omar was hijacked by
Somali gunmen on the coastal lines of the northeastern regions.
Farah Omar was a famous fighter against the British colonialists
in northern Somalia.
</P>
<P>
After serious negotiations, the ship administration paid
500,000 U.S. Dollars as a ransom for so-called "marine borders
violations".

<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- China's World champion Mo Huilan,
known among her foreign rivals as "mighty mouse" in gymnastics, is
here in Atlanta to win more gold medals.
</P>
<P>
After her last podium training in the Gerogia Dome, the
1.40-meter-tall Mo walked to the dressing room with a sweet smile
on her face and a toy bear in her arms, a gift for her 17th
birthday.
</P>
<P>
"Her birthday coincides with the opening of the Atlanta Games
and it is a lucky sign for Mo Huilan," said Chinese head
coach Qian Kui. "Nothing could be better than a gold medal for her
turning 17 in Atlanta."
</P>
<P>
Mo showed outstanding form in China's last podium training
Thursday. Her performance on the balanced beam and uneven bars
caught the spotlight when she completed her unique Mo's Salto, a
multi-salto forward tacked over the high bar which she created
herself.
</P>
<P>
Last fall in Sabae, Japan, she put up a near-perfect
performance on the balanced beam to win the gold medal in the 1995
World Championships, her first world title after sweeping five
golds in the 1994 Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
She almost bagged the all-around crown in Sabae leading all the
way through the compulsory routines. But a sit-down landing off the
beam in the optionals cost her dearly.
</P>
<P>
"That served a good lesson for me. So later I
concentrated more on the individual finals," she said.
</P>
<P>
"Now in Atlanta, I'm more confident with more international
experience behind me. I'll do my best," she added with a smile.
</P>
<P>
One of Mo's close rivals on the beam is her teammate Kui
Yuanyuan, who at 15 won the floor gold in the Puerto Rico World
Individual Championships in early May.
</P>
<P>
Kui said, "The floor title in Puerto Rico was a surprise to me.
My forte is on the beam."
</P>
<P>
"No matter who gets the gold here, Mo or I, it's for China,"
she added.

LUSAKA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government will not
interfere in the price mechanism of the property market, Minister
of Works and Supply Patrick Kafumukache said here today.
</P>
<P>
Opening a workshop of the Zambia Institute of Estates Agents,
he said that although a bill to regulate the work of estate
agents will soon be tabled before parliament, the implementation
of the new law will not interfere with the price mechanism.
</P>
<P>
Kafumukache said the bill will also not remove the
responsibility of the Zambia Institute of Estate Agents because
the institute is meant to champion the stablization in the price
mechanism in the real estate business.
</P>
<P>
The minister expressed the hope that the institute will remove
all imperfections inherent in the market, especially given the
free market economy of the country.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, Institute President Sonny Mulenga said
estate business is most important for any meaningful economic
development and that it is necessary to train professionals to
handle the property issue.
</P>
<P>
Mulenga said many individuals and companies have been losing a
lot of money through fraudulent dealings with unscrupulous estate
agents and that regulation is necessary for the benefits of the
public.

<P>
ANKARA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Iranian deputy Foreign Minister
Alaaddin Burujerdi said here today that his talks with Turkish
Prime minister Necmettin Erbakan were very positive for the
bilateral relations between Iran and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Burujerdi, who arrived here Thursday for a two-day official
visit to Turkey, submitted a message from Iranian President Ali
Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani to Erbakan during the meeting, but he did
not disclose the contents of the message.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran and Turkey have a political desire for a very
good relations in the future, adding that " we will solve all the
problems (between the two countries) with this political desire."
</P>
<P>
Burujerdi also submitted an invitation from Iranian first vice
President Hasan Habibi to Erbakan to pay an official visit to Iran.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian deputy foreign minister said Thursday that the
exchange of visits by top leaders, agreed upon two years ago,
would be realized as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan has said that Turkey will further strengthen its
relations with the Islamic countries, especially Iran, Iraq and
Syria.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Burujerdi and Ali Tuygan, Undersecretary of the
Turkish Foreign Ministry, held talks on the latest developments
of the border problems between Turkey and Iran.
</P>
<P>
Tuygan said that it is expected that the military delegations
from both countries will investigate the incidents which occurred
on the borders of both countries.
</P>
<P>
Iran accused Turkey of shelling the Iranian territory in
recent military operations against the outlawed Kurdish Workers'
Party (PKK).
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the Turkish coalition government led by
Erbakan won the vote of confidence in the parliament, Iranian
Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said that Erbakan has always
adopted a friendly stance toward Iran and since he is in
favor of having cordial ties with Islamic states, " we are
looking forward to seeing more friendly ties between Iran and
Turkey in future."

<P>
The Germans will also come up with challenges from the "Second
Echelon" headed by the rapidly-rising Chinese who were placed
fourth in the Barcelona Games with 16 gold medals.
</P>
<P>
The "Second Echelon" includes a dozen countries such as
Caribbean sports power Cuba, Italy, South Korea, Hungary, France
and Australia.
</P>
<P>
According to Li Furong, an official in charge of the training
of Chinese athletes, 309 Chinese athletes will take part in 153
events and they have the possibility to win medals in some 60
events.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that China may well strike gold in table tennis,
diving, shooting and gymnastics on the strength of such elite
athletes as world champion paddler Deng Yaping, divers Xiong Ni
and Fu Mingxia, sharpshooter Wang Yifu and gymnasts Li Xiaoshuang
and Mo Huilan.
</P>
<P>
He said China might collect ten gold medals at the quadrennial
Olympics to keep its leading position in the second group. But
it is going to be a tough job because China is closely followed by
a dozen other teams.
</P>
<P>
Australia, the next Games host, is said to have spent one
million U.S. dollars in getting the "Olympic training secrets" from
the Russians, hoping to establish itself as the leader in the
second tier by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
The Australians are expected to bag 12 to 14 golds in the
current Games. Apart from the swimming pool, they are also ready to
scratch a slice of gold medals in other water sports of rowing,
canoeing and yachting, as well as from cycling, field hockey and
equestrian competitions.
</P>
<P>
Judging from their performance at last year's major
tournaments, Italy may harvest 12 to 16 golds if its athletes
keep wide open the outlets for the fighting stamina in the world's
top-notched competition arena.
</P>
<P>
Coming out as a Caribbean power, Cuba enjoys an edge for gold
medals in athletics, boxing, judo, baseball, fencing,
weightlifting and women's volleyball, and is on its way to retain
the fifth overall spot with 13 to 15 golds in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
Fierce as the fight among the "Second Echelon" may be, it is
certain to provide a whole series of exciting and breathtaking
drama.

Watch out for the exciting tussel in the Centennial Games
between Russia and Germany for the second place in the gold medal
tally.
</P>
<P>
Competing in the Olympics for the first time as an independent
team, the Russians already set their sights on the second place. A
top sports official said earlier this year that the country which
wins 36 to 37 golds or more would be the top sports power in the
world and the Russians would snatch as many golds as they can.
</P>
<P>
Reliable sources say that, to spur on the Russian Olympians to
achieve good results, 100,000 U.S. dollars are offered for each
gold winner by the sports organizations.

<P>
The Russians are really strong in athletics, swimming,
shooting, fencing, weightlifting, judo, boxing and wrestling.

Germans these days seem to keep a low profile and will possibly
end up in the third place.
</P>
<P>
A few days before the opening of the Games, talented Steffi
Graf, number one in the world women's tennis, withdrew from
competition due to a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
The Germans usually show strength in rowing, canoeing,
equestrian, cycling and tennis sports. They may also steal gold
medals in the events of fencing, boxing and shooting.
</P>
<P>
However, experts here indicate that the Germans would win three
or four gold medals less than the Russians in the 17-day medal
chasing battle.

<HEADLINE> Battle for Sports Supremacy Unfolding in Atlanta (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The opening of the 26th Olympic
Games here Friday evening marks the start of a gruelling yet exciting
battle for excellence and supremacy in sports world.
</P>
<P>
Host the United States is tipped to regain its leading position
in the gold medal tally followed by Russia and Germany.
</P>
<P>
Four years ago in Barcelona, the Unified Team comprising
member-republics of the former Soviet Union, the U.S. and Germany
formed the troika in world sports, winning a total of 115 gold
medals, far more than the number collected by the rest of the
world.
</P>
<P>
The Unified Team led with 45 gold medals, eight more than the
Americans' haul.
</P>
<P>
Riding on its home ground advantage, the Americans will delight
their fans by winning one seventh of the 271 gold medals on offer.
</P>
<P>
Their medal hopes mainly rest on athletics and swimming
which combine to offer one third of the gold haul. Sprinter
Michael Johnson is expected to realize his dream by winning the
men's 200m and 400m races, becoming the first runner in history to
win both events at one Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The Americans also have a clear edge in the women's sprints and
are expected to repeat their victories scored in the 1992 Barcelona
Games.
</P>
<P>
In the swimming field, the Americans will meet tougher
challenges here from Russia, China, Australia, Germany and Hungary
than four years ago. Still, they can collect at least eight golds,
the same as they took in Barcelona.
</P>
<P>
The 21-year-old Tom Dolan, pace setter for the U.S. swimming
team, is considered to set himself up for a repeat of Mark Spitz's
1972 multiple-gold medal performance after winning the 200m and
400m individual medley and 400m freestyle in the American trials
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
The Americans are also expected to show their prowess in the
sports of wrestling, boxing, cycling, rowing, shooting,
basketball, gymnastics, tennis and softball.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Making Zambia Polio Free </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(By Du Zhenfeng and Wang Nengbiao)
</P>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Young parents, young mothers in
particular, are seen lining up at immunization posts in Lusaka,
as well as at other posts throughout Zambia to get polio vaccines
for their children.
</P>
<P>
A polio eradication campaign is going on in Zambia, both in
the urban and rural areas. An official ceremony for ''national
immunization days'' was launched by President Frederick Chiluba
in the health center of Chipata compound, a peri-urban settlement
in the suburbs of Lusaka this morning.
</P>
<P>
the president declared in his speech, ''we in Zambia are today
joining other nations in the region in this crucial campaign to
combat polio'' and ''we must eradicate polio from Zambia, and
indeed the whole Africa and the rest of the globe.''
</P>
<P>
Chiluba then administered two children to receive
immunization. Each of them, in the arms of their mother, took two
drops of polio vaccine in the health center.
</P>
<P>
In the past month or so, vivid advertisements havae been seen
in TV screens: lovely children wave little hands and
say: ''bye-bye polio'', health officials talk about the necessity
of immunization, and polio victims appeal to parents to get their
children immunized by talking about their sufferings from the
polio epidemic ...
</P>
<P>
''Making Zambia polio free'' advertisements, in paintings and
slogans, are spotted in public places, road bridges and shop
entrances. Small boards with publicity of polio immunization are
even seen in boothes of street vendors.
</P>
<P>
The Zambia Congress of Trade Unions has issued a directive
that workers work half day so that they may take their children
to get vaccines during the national immunization days which fall
on July 19-20 as the first round and August 23-24 as the second
round.
</P>
<P>
A special office was set up in the Ministry of Health for the
polio immunization drive. Its coordinator Mary Kaoma told Xinhua
that over 1.6 million children under five in the country are
expected to get polio vaccines.
</P>
<P>
She said vaccination will take place in health centers,
schools, markets, churches, community centers and other places
where people can easily go.
</P>
<P>
To this effect, 9,000 immunization centers have been set up
throughout the country, while 600 of them are in the capital.
Special teams with the vaccines will be sent to remote rural
areas to have the children there immunized.
</P>
<P>
In 1988, the countries of the world at the world health
assembly established the year 2000 as the target of global polio
eradication.
</P>
<P>
As a response to the global commitment within the polio
eradication initiative and to achieve a polio-free continent,
Kaoma said, some 26 African countries are planning to conduct
full or partial immunization days in 1996.
</P>
<P>
She added that Zambia is grouped together with Kenya, Tanzania
and Uganda in the eastern African epidemiological block. This
means that these countries will be conducting national
immunization days almost simultaneously.

<HEADLINE> China Eyes Gold in Ten Sports at Atlanta Olympics (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Table tennis is another bonanza for Chinese who won two golds
at the Seoul Olympics and three in the Barcelona Games.
</P>
<P>
China's clean sweep of seven titles at the World Table Tennis
Championships last year underlined the country's depth of talents
but it by no means ensures another gold sweep at the Atlanta
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Reigning world and Olympic champion Deng Yaping is a hot
favorite for the women's singles title. But the world top player
will have to overcome strong challenges from former Chinese
nationals who now represent their adopted countries or regions.
</P>
<P>
Former world champion Chire Koyama of Japan, Jing Jun Hong of
Singapore and Geng Lijuan of Canada, all former Chinese national
team members, will be big obstacles to Deng's effort to defend her
title.
</P>
<P>
Chinese paddlers are also considered hot favorites in the men's
singles, men's and women's doubles events.
</P>
<P>
In shooting, Wang Yifu, the air pistol champion and free pistol
runner-up in the 1992 Games, is favored to win the men's free
pistol event while Li Duihong is tipped as title hopeful in the
women's air and sport pistol events.
</P>
<P>
The other title contenders are Yang Ling and Xiao Jun in the
running target and Xu Xiang in the women's skeet.
</P>
<P>
Weightlifter Zhang Xiangsen, who narrowly defeated out-of-form
Halil Mutlu to win the 54kg class in the 1995 World Championships,
will have to exert every ounce of his energy to lift a gold medal
in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
Shuttler Ye Zhaoying is highly favored for the women's singles
title. She has the skill and experience to win China's first
Olympic badminton gold but she should further toughen her nerve.
</P>
<P>
Gymnastics is the third medal producer for the Chinese who are
said to be born flexible. The Chinese turned and twisted to bag
eight golds at the last three Olympics including Li Ning's
hat-trick in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
Li Ning's namesake Li Xiaoshuang is tipped as title hopeful in
the men's all-around event. He is also a serious contender for
the parallel bars and floor exercise.
</P>
<P>
Mo Huilan, who jumped to fame with a five-gold sweep in the
1994 Asian Games and won the balance beam gold in the 1995 World
Championships, stands a great chance in the uneven bars and
balance beam events here in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
Although between six and 16 gold medals is the closest guess,
one thing is certain -- the tender sex on team China will prove
stronger than the males by winning more golds in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
"In Atlanta, most of China's possible golds will still come
from the women Olympians," said Wu Shaozu, China's sports
minister.

<HEADLINE> China Eyes Gold in Ten Sports at Atlanta Olympics (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>

</P>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- In the run-up to the Centennial
Olympic Games, many people have been guessing and gauging about
the possible performance of the Chinese Olympians in Atlanta from
July 20 to August 4.
</P>
<P>
The core interest is how many gold medals the Chinese athletes
can bring home. Will their haul be more than the hoard from
Barcelona four years ago or fewer than nip in Seoul, or somewhere
in between?
</P>
<P>
China managed only five gold medals in the Seoul Olympics and
four years later it snatched 16 golds at Barcelona. A careful
peruse of the 309 athletes to Atlanta reveals that the Chinese are
strong contenders for top honors in 10 sports, namely, swimming
(including diving), table tennis, gymnastics, shooting, badminton,
weightlifting, women's volleyball, rowing, track and field and
women's judo.
</P>
<P>
Leading China's title hopefuls is the star-studded diving team.
Fu Mingxia, women's world and Olympic platform champion, and
women's springboard champion Tan Shuping are odds-on favorites for
the Olympic honors.
</P>
<P>
Men's world and Olympic platform titlist Sun Shuwei failed to
qualify for the Olympics, but his compatriots Tian Liang and Xiao
Hailiang should be strong enough to have a shot at the title while
Xiong Ni and Yu Zhuocheng will launch a two-pronged thrust at the
crown of the men's springboard, the only event that gave the slip
to the Chinese in the Barcelona Games.
</P>
<P>
Other possible golds for China will come out of the Olympic
pools too. Chen Yunpeng, former head coach of the Chinese
national swimming team, said the Chinese are title hopefuls in
five events -- the women's 50m and 100m freestyle, the 100m and
200m butterfly and the women's 4X100m freestyle relay.
</P>
<P>
Best known in the Chinese swimming team are world champion Le
Jingyi, world record holder in both women's 50m and 100m
freestyle, and world butterfly champion Liu Limin.
</P>
<P>
Le swam the world best time in the China's Champions Cup in
April this year whereas Liu ended China's gold drought in major
competitions last year by taking a gold medal at the Fukuoka
University Games in September.

<HEADLINE> Singapore FM to Attend ASEAN Ministerial Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Foreign Minister S.
Jayakumar will attend the 29th ASEAN (Association of Southeast
Asian Nations) Ministerial Meeting (AMM) in Jakarta from July 20
to 25, the Foreign Ministry announced today.
</P>
<P>
It said that Jayakumar will also take part in the third ASEAN
Regional Forum (ARF) and the annual Post-Ministerial Conferences
(PMC) with ASEAN's Dialogue Partners during the period.
</P>
<P>
At the 29th AMM, which will be held on Saturday and Sunday, the
ASEAN Foreign Ministers will review ASEAN's activities and
external relations over the past year and lay down policy
guidelines for the coming year, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
It said that the progress of ASEAN cooperation in the
political, economic and functional areas is also expected to be
reviewed by the foreign ministers.
</P>
<P>
But, the highlights for this year's AMM will also include the
admission of Myanmar as an observer of ASEAN, and the upgrading of
India, China, and Russia to full Dialogue Partner status, it
stressed.
</P>
<P>
China and Russia had regularly participated in ASEAN
Ministerial Meetings in their capacity as Consultative Partners of
ASEAN, while India was previously a Sectoral Dialogue Partner of
ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
At the third ARF, which will be held next Tuesday, India and
Myanmar are expected to be admitted to the ARF, thus increasing
its membership to 21 participants. The ARF, established in 1994,
now provides an essential framework for confidence-building in the
region.
</P>
<P>
At the PMC to be held on July 24-25, the seven ASEAN foreign
ministers will meet their counterparts from the ten Dialogue
Partner countries for an exchange of views on political and
security issues, as well as on international economic issues, the
ministry said.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Army Repulses Attack of Tamil Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan army has repulsed a
major attack launched Thursday by Tamil rebels on the Mullativu
military base on the northeastern coast, a military spokesman said
at a news briefing here this evening.
</P>
<P>
In response to earlier reports said that both sides suffered
heavy casualties, the spokesman, Brigadier Sarath Munasinghe, said
that the casualty figure could not be available before the
reinforcements joined the troops at the base.
</P>
<P>
He described the Tamil rebels' claim that 500 government
soldiers were killed as "absurd."
</P>
<P>
A foreign media report Thursday said that Tamil rebel leader
Prabhakaran, who led the attack, was wounded in the fighting. But
Munasinghe said that "there was no such thing."
</P>
<P>
He said that the troops at the base, who had earlier spilt into
groups, had now gathered together and were fighting back
effectively.
</P>
<P>
According to Munasinghe, the Tamil rebels wanted to revamp
their image after its former headquarters on Jaffna peninsula were
captured by the government last year.

<HEADLINE> Karadzic Steps Down Under Intense Pressure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Radovan Karadzic officially
resigned today as president of the Bosnian Serb state "Republika
Srpska" and head of the Serb Democratic Party (SDS) under intense
pressure from the West.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. envoy, Richardx Holbrooke, said: "Dr. Radovan Karadzic
states that he shall withdraw immediately and permanently from all
political activities."
</P>
<P>
The envoy said he had received an undertaking signed by
Karadzic.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke made the announcement last night in Belgrade after
holding lengthy talks with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic,
who has strong influence over Bosnian Serbs.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Holbrooke threatened to reimpose economic
sanctions and ban the participation of SDS in the first post-war
elections in Bosnia to be held in September if Karadzic did not
relinquish his power and public life.
</P>
<P>
Bosnian Muslim leader Alija Izetbegovic had also warned of a
boycott of the elections if Karadzic still hung on power.
</P>
<P>
Karadzic, twice-indicted as a war criminal, delegated his
presidential duties to his deputy, Biljana Plavsic, late last
month but still holds the presidency of SDS.
</P>
<P>
Under the Dayton agreement, people indicted as war criminals
are barred from taking part in the elections or holding elected
offices.

<HEADLINE> HK SAR Chief Must Be Chinese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The Chief Executive of the future
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region must be a Chinese citizen,
and also a permanent Hong Kong resident, according to a meeting
held today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
At the second session of the Chief Executive Panel of the
Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong SAR, held on July 18 and 19
in Beijing, the panel also held that candidates for the post must
be not less than 40 years old, and have ordinarily resided in Hong
Kong for a continuous period of not less than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
The candidates must also have no legal right of abode in
foreign countries, support the Basic Law, and be willing to pledge
loyalty to Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
It was also proposed that incumbent civil servants can be
nominated candidates for the Chief Executive. But they must resign
when nominated.
</P>
<P>
Most of panel members agreed that candidates cannot be
nominated in the capacity of representatives of any political
party or organ, and they must quit from any political party or
organ when nominated.
</P>
<P>
On the precise method for selecting the first Chief Executive,
members said he or she should be chosen through local
consultations, or through nomination and election after
consultations, according to the relevant stipulations of the
National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary discussions on the two methods were made at the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Members proposed details on the consultation, nomination, how
to decide a namelist of the candidates, method of election, and
method and procedure to report to the Central People's Government
for appointment.
</P>
<P>
They also pointed out that after the Selection Committee is
formed, the work concerned with choosing candidates for the Chief
Executive must be conducted under the administration of the
Preparatory Committee.
</P>
<P>
After the candidate is chosen by the Selection Committee, the
Preparatory Committee will report to the Central People's
Government for appointment.

<HEADLINE> Guangzhou to Explore New Ways of Cooperation with Hong Kong (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Over the past few years Guangzhou has greatly expanded
cooperation with Hong Kong in a wide range of industries, such as
banking, tourism, commerce and real estate, according to Li.
</P>
<P>
"Cooperation with Hong Kong has facilitated economic and social
reforms in Guangzhou and enabled Guangzhou to lead all other major
cities in China in creating a market economics," he said.
</P>
<P>
He proposed that Guangzhou and Hong Kong set up an economic
coordination organization composed of representatives of trading
companies, enterprises and research institutes located in the two
=areas.
</P>
<P>
The organization should formulate regulations, policies and
measures to advance cooperation in the two areas, and help adapt
the economic operational mechanism in Guangzhou to that in Hong
Kong and to international practices, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The mayor also stressed the need to step up technological
cooperation between the two areas, in an effort to promote the
growth of hi-tech industries.
</P>
<P>
He proposed that a semi-official department be established to
organize cooperation and exchanges in such industries.
</P>
<P>
A technology market should be set up to serve the two areas and
their policies, to encourage the development of such industries
and the application of high technology to production, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Both areas should increase appropriations in hi-tech
industries. I think that is essential to cooperation between and
development in the two areas," he stressed.

<P>
Mayor Li also called for efforts to expand cooperation in the
service sector and to aid its growth so that the two areas can
better supply each other's needs.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong businesses will be encouraged to invest in the
financial and commercial sectors in Guangzhou, enabling such
sectors in Hong Kong to play a dual role in Guangzhou, he said.
</P>
<P>
"With the approval of China's central bank, the People's Bank
of China, Hong Kong financial institutions can open representative
offices or branch offices in Guangzhou," he said.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou will draw on Hong Kong's marketing methods and
utilize its international trade channels, capital and technology,
to open a commercial network to both the domestic and global
markets.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is necessary to link major construction
projects in Hong Kong with the construction plan for Guangzhou and
the Pearl River Delta.
</P>
<P>
"While introducing Hong Kong funds for infrastructure in
Guangzhou, we will pursue more preferential treatment than to
investors in other areas," he said.
</P>
<P>
Li said that Guangzhou will work with Hong Kong to train a
large number of experts and managerial staff in such sectors as
banking, commerce, international trade, consulting and information.
</P>
<P>
"I am sure that with concerted efforts, Guangzhou and Hong Kong
will certainly be able to become more prosperous and stable in the
future," he said.

GUANGZHOU, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Historical sites have been

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, July 19 (Xinhua) --- Guangzhou Mayor Li Ziliu has
pledged to explore new forms of cooperation with Hong Kong in a
move to promote the development and prosperity of both Guangzhou
and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
To this end, Li said, "We should give full play to Guangzhou's
advantages as the largest city in south China, particularly its
advantage in the service sector, in order to step up the
development of the South China Economic Rim covering Hong Kong,
Macao and the Pearl River Delta in Guangdong Province."
</P>
<P>
Ninety percent of the scientists and researchers in Guangdong
Province are in Guangzhou, he said, adding that the city also has
a solid manufacturing foundation and a number of major
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
The service sector, including the commercial, banking and
information industries, now contributes more than 50 percent to
Guangzhou's gross domestic product -- the value of the produced
goods and services.
</P>
<P>
In terms of overall economic strength, Guangzhou ranks third
among major cities in China, next only to Shanghai and Beijing, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"With these advantages, I am sure that Guangzhou will be able
to greatly expand economic cooperation with Hong Kong in the
future," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that both Hong Kong's investment in Guangzhou and Hong
Kong-funded companies account for 80 percent of overseas
investment introduced by Guangzhou and of the total number of
overseas-funded enterprises in the city.

while the inflation rate is expected to drop to about 7.2 percent,
according to a half-year analysis published by Bank of China Group

Both internal and external factors affecting Hong Kong's

It said that Hong Kong's economy is heading in a favorable
direction and the overall performance this year will improve
slightly from 1995. The local economy will gradually be back on a

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Suzhou, a 2,000-year-old city in
east China's Jiangsu Province, has boosted its tourism industry by
developing the Taihu Lake tourism resources over the past few
years.
</P>
<P>
Suzhou, one of the 24 historical and cultural cities designated
by the Chinese government, is well known in China and abroad for
its 400 historical sites and scenic spots.
</P>
<P>
Gardens in the city, one of the most developed areas in China,
are famed throughout the world for their small size, compact
structure and picturesque scenery.
</P>
<P>
The Zhuozheng Garden and Liuyuan Garden in Suzhou, the former
imperial gardens at the Summer Palace in Beijing and the Summer
Resort in Chengde are known as the four most beautiful gardens in
China.
</P>
<P>
Suzhou is also the birthplace of the Kun Opera, a popular opera
in east China's Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, and is well known
for its painting, calligraphy, seal carving and poems.
</P>
<P>
The city's long history and unique tourism resources attract
large numbers of visitors from the rest of China and the world
every year.
</P>
<P>
According to local government officials, over the past few
years Suzhou has linked tourism services based on historical sites
with those based on natural scenery of the Taihu Lake, one of the
four largest lakes in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Taihu Lake, dotted with 48 islands, covers 2,200 sq km, two
thirds of which lie in Wuxian County governed by Suzhou.
</P>
<P>
The 600 sq km Taihu National Tourism and Vacationing Zone has
ten scenic areas including Xishan (western hills), Dongshan
(eastern hills), Guangfu and Mudu, and 100 historical sites,
according to Xu Xiaonan, general manager of the zone's Development
Group.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Hosts Asia Derivatives Forum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Representatives from 10 Asian
central banks, regulatory bodies and market participants ended a
one-day meeting in Hong Kong today on risk management of
derivatives.
</P>
<P>
The Asia Derivatives Forum, the first of its kind in the
region, was co-organized by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority
(HKMA) and the International Swaps and Derivatives Association
(ISDA).
</P>
<P>
Participants agreed that regular exchange of information and
views can play an important role in enhancing effective regulation
of derivatives trading activities.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech to the forum, HKMA's deputy chief
executive, David Carse, said that with the increase in derivatives
activities both domestically and globally, it is important for
regulators to take active steps to keep themselves up to date with
market and supervisory trends and to maintain a close dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Of the seven largest derivatives markets in the world, three
are in Asia: Japan, Singapore and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
A survey conducted by HKMA last year shows that the volume of
outstanding foreign exchange and interest rate derivative
contracts in Hong Kong as at the end of April 1995 amounted to
over 1,600 billion US dollars while the average daily turnover
reached 74 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Quentin Hills, co-chairman of the ISDA, said that the
significance of this forum is that regulators and market
practitioners are sharing their knowledge and concerns to promote
common goals.
</P>
<P>
Participants of the forum include senior regulatory officials
from Australia, Hong Kong, Indonesia Japan, the Republic of Korea,
Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand.

<HEADLINE> Police Start Dispersing Demonstrators in Istanbul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Turkish police started operations
this morning to disperse a large crowd demonstrating in front of a
communal house in Istanbul's Alawite-dominated Gaziosmanpasa
district and barricading the street in support of those currently
on hunger strike in several prisons in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators who started barricades Wednesday also
protested the heavy police presence in the district ever since
the clashes between the police and residents left 25 dead in March
last year.
</P>
<P>
With the support of armored vehicles, policemen passed over the
barricades blocking Ismetapsa Street and the demonstrators began
running away.
</P>
<P>
The police threw tear bombs into the demonstrators who have
hidden in the Cemevi building in Gazi district.
</P>
<P>
The latest unrest started when local vigilantes detained and
interrogated a man with five separate identity cards, whom they
suspected to be an undercover police agent.
</P>
<P>
The incident continued Wednesday night and Thursday. The
demonstrators took control of the streets around the Cemevi
building, which is a meeting place for members of the district's
large Alevi community, and set fire to barricades.
</P>
<P>
The Gaziosmanpasa district has been a hot spot for
demonstrations since an incident erupted last year following a gun
attack on a cafe and the Cemevi building. The incident spread to
other quarters and 25 people were killed in the resulting
rampage.

<HEADLINE> Initial Achievements in Fighting Huaihe River Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The central government and the four
provinces along the Huaihe River, Anhui, Henan, Shandong and
Jiangsu, are working together to fight pollution in the Huaihe
River.
</P>
<P>
The State Council ordered that all the small paper mills in the
river basin with a yearly output below 5,000 tons be closed by the
end of June. It also mandated all sources of industrial pollution
in the river basin must meet state standards within the next year,
and that the Huaihe River must be completely cleaned by the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
In order to clean the water effectively, Anhui Province
developed a system of goals and responsibilities that must be
strictly followed.
</P>
<P>
Henan Province has established various channels to provide
funding for the clean-up efforts. Special funds have also been
established in Shandong and Jiangsu provinces.
</P>
<P>
In Shenqiu County of Henan Province, six small paper mills were
forced to close, and their directors were arrested for not
following state orders.
</P>
<P>
By the end of June, 999 small paper mills had been closed, it
was reported.
</P>
<P>
Although initial achievements have been made to eliminate
pollution, problems still remain.
</P>
<P>
Local enforcement of anti-pollution mandates is still a
challenge for those involved in clean-up efforts. Reports say that
in Tongshan County of Jiangsu Province, some small paper mills are
now increasing their pollution and have not yet closed.
</P>
<P>
Problems are also found along the borders of provinces because
of the lack of coordination among organizations.
</P>
<P>
Some small paper mills pretend to be closed while their
machines continue to operate.
</P>
<P>
The lack of appropriate technology is still a problem in
dealing with the river pollution. In Yingshang County of Anhui
Province, the director of a paper mill said that after visiting
many research institutes, he still could not find the adequate
techniques for his mill to use to thoroughly clean the polluted
water.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Remains Grateful to Nigeria: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 19 (Xinhua) -- South Africa remains grateful to
Nigeria for the leadership role it played during the liberation
struggle from apartheid despite the face-off between the two
countries since last November.
</P>
<P>
This was said by South African High Commissioner to Nigeria
Sipho George Nene to the Daily Times newspaper on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said South Africa's policy position is to encourage and
provide bilateral relations which are mandated by history and
destiny.
</P>
<P>
According to him, President Nelson Mandela is still fond of
Nigeria which had used all available resources to liberate South
Africa from the claws of apartheid.
</P>
<P>
He said Mandela's role in the suspension of Nigeria from the
53-nation Commonwealth after the execution of the nine Ogonis
last year was informed by his personal principle, the agitations
of South Africans and the general consensus among world leaders
to condemn the action.
</P>
<P>
President Mandela's pronouncement at the Commonwealth was
based on principle which borders on respect for human rights,
Nene said, adding that South Africa was not championing a cause
against Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Mandela's government was under pressure from
non-governmental organizations and interest groups in South
Africa to take prompt action.
</P>
<P>
South Africa, which has been following closely the political
situation in Nigeria, will not tolerate military role on its soil
and so it will be difficult for the country's white-dominated
army to take over government, the envoy said.
</P>
<P>
Nene who was recalled to South Africa for consultation last
November said relations between the two countries were improved
but declined to comment on the progress made so far by Nigeria on
the transition to civil rule program.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, South Africa will abide by the international
decisions already taken by United Nations and the Commonwealth
action group on the issue.
</P>
<P>
The envoy said he was back in Nigeria on a friendly mission
with the motive of boosting trade and cultural relations between
the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Albanian, Italian Foreign Ministers Hold Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto
Dini and his Albanian counterpart Tritan Shehu today exchanged
views in a "cordial atmosphere" on bilateral relations, Albania's
entry into the European Union (EU) and cooperation in judicial
affairs.
</P>
<P>
Shehu noted that in the process of economic privatization,
Albania has provided good opportunities of investment and trade
for Italian businessmen. He asked Italian businessmen to make good
use of these opportunities, the Foreign Ministry said in a press
release.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that it's Albania's wish and choice to become a
member of the EU and that Albania has made positive efforts to
attain this goal.
</P>
<P>
Shehu underlined the importance of enhancing bilateral
cooperation in economy, trade, judicial affairs and crackdown on
illegal immigration.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Dini said Italy understood and supported
Albania's wish of joining the EU.
</P>
<P>
He said Italy had made efforts to help Albania on this issue
when it was acting as the rotating president of the EU in the
first half of 1996.
</P>
<P>
During the transition towards market economy, Dini said,
Albania should speed up the democratization process, including
political dialogue between the government and opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
This is very important to the forthcoming October elections in
Albania, he added.
</P>
<P>
Shehu will also meet leaders of the Italian National Alliance
and Partito Popopare (the People's Party).

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah, Israel to Complete Swapping Deal in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez
Boueiz said he expected that a deal currently mediated by Germans
on swapping bodies of the Israeli soldiers and guerrillas killed
in south Lebanon and war prisoners would be completed in "several
days."
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Beirut Al-Liwa daily which was issued
this morning, Boueiz said that the operation of exchanging the
remains of the two Israeli soldiers killed in Lebanon with the
remains of the guerrillas and prisoners seized by Israel would be
carried out by two steps.
</P>
<P>
"The first step, revolving around the bodies, will be finished
in the next few hours, and the second step, in which the prisoners
will be exchanged, will take some time, probably several days and
no more," the foreign minister added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Lebanese resistance was a "basical part" in
the deal because all the bodies Israel would hand over were of the
resistants, and more than 85 percent of the prisoners the Jewish
state would release had relations with the resistance.
</P>
<P>
The resistance, or Al-Moqawama, is a name used in a general
sense to include all the armed Lebanese groups engaged in a
guerrilla war against the Israeli occupation in south Lebanon, in
which the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, plays a major
role.
</P>
<P>
"In this event, the resistance is a basical part, the Israeli
army is a basical part, and the Lebanese government and the
Israeli government are two basical parts, in an addition to the
American-Iranian-Syrian background," the Lebanese foreign
minister said.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations, which were conducted through German
intermediaries, "started several months ago and reached a
mature phase in the last two weeks," Boueiz added.
</P>
<P>
"The executive process, in which the Lebanese government
participated, started after progress had been made on the
diplomatic and political levels," he said. "Now things are under
way on the security level."
</P>
<P>
Informed security sources in Beirut said this morning that a
German team had held two rounds of talks with Hezbollah in the
Lebanese capital since Tuesday, which were attended by Raymond
Roufayel, director general of the Public Security in Lebanon's
Interior Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Roufayel was in charge of conveying the results of the talks to
the interior minister and prime minister, according to the
anonymous sources.
</P>
<P>
Positive progress was achieved in the talks, the sources
said. Nonetheless, the number of prisoners to be released by
Israel is yet to be determined.
</P>
<P>
They added that Israel refused to release Sheikh Abdel Karim
Abeid and Mostafa Dirani, two Hezbollah leaders who were abducted
from their homes by Israeli commandos respectively in 1989 and
1991, and Souha Beshra, who staged an aborted attempt on the life
of Antoine Lahd, leader of Israel's South Lebanon Army militia, in
the late 1980s.

<HEADLINE> China Suffers 71 Billion Yuan Losses From Natural Disasters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Natural disasters in China have so
far this year cost 71 billion yuan in losses, Fan Baojun, vice
minister of civil affairs revealed today.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary statistics show that by July 18 natural disasters
had affected more than 35 million hectares of crops, with 2.4
million ha of the land devoid of any harvest.
</P>
<P>
Over 1.6 million houses collapsed, and more than 4.5 million
houses were damaged in earthquakes and floods.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,875 people died in natural disasters, with the
human toll in the recent floods already standing at 716 deaths,
vice minister Fan told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
By yesterday more than 9.6 million ha of farmland were affected
by floods, with 1.04 million ha of the farmland devoid of any
harvest.
</P>
<P>
The floods have so far destroyed 810,000 houses and caused
damage to a further 2.8 million homes. Up to four million people
were besieged by the floods. More than two million people were
forced to leave home.
</P>
<P>
At least 716 people died in the floods.
</P>
<P>
The vice minister said that the Chinese government has worked
hard in flood relief work, putting the provision of money and
relief aid at the top of its agenda.
</P>
<P>
Fan said that China's natural disasters have aroused grave
concern from the international community.
</P>
<P>
Southwest China's Yunnan Province suffered an earthquake
measuring 7.0 on Richter scale in early February. The province
received 455 million yuan in funds, with aid donated from home and
abroad. Of the 332 million yuan in cash, more than 50.4 percent
came from Hong Kong compatriots.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the international community has also
lent a helping hand to China's relief efforts in the recent floods
in South China, adding that five countries have promised formally
to provide a total of 615,000 US dollars for flood relief.
</P>
<P>
Of these countries, Japan promised 300,000 US dollars of cash
and 300,000 US dollar-worth of materials. The Republic of Korea
provided 100,000 US dollars. Germany offered 200,000 Marks
(170,000 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Fan said that besides the international community, Chinese
citizens are also active in donating money, clothes and
quilts. People in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangdong and Fujian have
donated more than 20 million items of clothing and quilts, and
over 20 million yuan in cash.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Ministry of Civil Affairs will launch a
nationwide campaign to urge people to donate clothes and quilts in
October, when the winter is about to set in.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Step Toward Defusing Tension in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The Greek Cypriot side and the
Turkish Cypriot side have reached an agreement on a meeting
between Commanders of the National Guard and Turkish forces in
Cyprus to discuss the security issues along the green line.
</P>
<P>
This was announced Thursday by U.S. permanent representative
to the U.N. Madeleine Albright at the end of her one-day visit
to the island.
</P>
<P>
"I am heartened that I can report some concrete progress. For
the first time the two sides have indicated a willingness to
convene a meeting of the Commander of the National Guard, and the
Commander of Turkish forces in Cyprus, under the auspices of
U.N. Commander as soon as possible."
</P>
<P>
Albright said such a meeting can help avoid misunderstandings
and ensure effective implementation of the relevant U.N. proposals
to reduce tensions along the buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was confirmed by the government spokesman
Yiannakis Cassoulides, who told reporters after Albright's
announcement that the military dialogue will begin as soon as the
venue is selected by the U.N. Peace-Keeping Forces Commander in
Cyprus, and the date is fixed following consultation with both sides.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, if takes place, will be the first ever between
the two army leaders and the first official-level talks between
the Greek and Turkish Cypriot sides since 1993.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was the result of Albright's shuttle diplomacy
on the island during her 24-hour visit.
</P>
<P>
The American diplomat had separate meetings with Cyprus
President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash, as well as meetings with Commander of the National
Guard Nicolaos Vorvolakos, and Commander of the Turkish forces
in Cyprus Hasan Kundaksi.
</P>
<P>
The American move came following an increasing tension
recently along the 180-kilometer-long buffer zone across the
island, which separates the island into two parts. A 1,200-strong
U.N. peace-keeping forces is patrolling along the buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
Last month, an unarmed Greek Cypriot solider was killed by a
Turkish Cypriot soldier in the buffer zone when the former was
reported to have walked across to exchange hats with the latter.
</P>
<P>
The tension escalated when Turkish warplanes made low-attitude
flights over the government-controlled southern part of the
divided Nicosia in June, in retaliation to the Greek warplanes
flying over the Cyprus airspace.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Step Toward Defusing Tension in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The military tension in this divided eastern Mediterranean
island has caused concern to the U.N. and international
community.
</P>
<P>
When President Glafcos Clerides had a meeting with U.S.
President Bill Clinton in Washington last month, Clinton pledged
to intensify peace efforts toward the Cyprus problem, with special
emphasis on security.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the U.N. Security Council adopted a resolution,
expressing serious concern about the continuing modernization and
upgrading of military forces in the Republic of Cyprus, excessive
levels of military forces and armaments and the lack of progress
toward a significant reduction in the number of foreign troops on
the island.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus government has expressed willingness to enter
military talks on U.N. proposals to ease tension along the green
line.
</P>
<P>
However, government spokesman Yiannakis Cassoulides played down
the significance of the proposed meeting between two army
chiefs, saying that only technical strategic issues, and not
political matters, would be discussed by the commanders.
</P>
<P>
The move was welcomed by Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash,
who expressed optimism that the military tension in Cyprus could
be defused within the coming months.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded
and seized 37 percent of the island following an Athens-backed
coup.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. efforts over the past 22 years have not managed to
bring the Greek and Turkish Cypriot sides on the island closer to
an agreement to settle the protracted Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that the U.S.-brokered meeting between
the two army commanders will be a step toward reducing military
tension in Cyprus. Furthermore, it is expected to facilitate
improvement of climate for negotiations of a Cyprus settlement.

<HEADLINE> Nearsighted Children Increasing Rapidly in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 19 (Xinhua) -- A new survey shows that the number
of nearsighted school children in Shanghai has witnessed a rapid
growth, arising the attention of eye experts.
</P>
<P>
According to China Women's News, nearly 45 percent of students
in senior secondary schools are nearsighted, while 40 percent in
junior secondary schools and 20 percent in primary schools suffer
from the problem.
</P>
<P>
The result also shows that in some key high schools the ratio
of nearsighted students has reached 70-80 percent of the total
enrolled.
</P>
<P>
And even five-ten percent of children in kindergartens have
become nearsighted.
</P>
<P>
Experts with the Shanghai Municipal Health Care Department said
the rapid growth rate of young nearsightedness is closely related
to doing so much homework and intensive competition.
</P>
<P>
Overusing eyesight by watching too much TV and using computers
and video games are also major factors deteriorating eyesight in
children.

<HEADLINE> India's Foreign Exchange Dealers Evade RBI Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Foreign exchange dealers in
India have worked out some ways to bypass the ban of the Reserve
Bank of India (RBI) on partial cancellation of forward contracts,
RBI sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
The RBI had recently banned corporations from partial
cancellation of forward contracts as it "increased speculation in
the foreign exchange markets."
</P>
<P>
The corporations going in for the cancellation had to cancel
their entire contract. The RBI, however, did not impose any ban on
leaving part of the risk uncovered.
</P>
<P>
In order to bypass the ban, authorized dealers have advised
corporations either to cancel the full contract or to take various
forward contracts to fully cover a single underlying transaction.
Hence if a corporation needs to cancel part of exposure cover it
can do away with a few forward contracts.
</P>
<P>
After the ban was imposed, many corporations have been crying
over loss of flexibility in covering their risk.
</P>
<P>
The issue of the ban on partial cancellation of forward
contracts is expected to be discussed at an RBI meeting scheduled
for July 25, which has been called to devise ways to control
volatility in foreign exchange markets, the RBI sources said.

<HEADLINE> Disabled from Earthquake Enjoy Life of Diversity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The streets of Tangshan are
dotted with disabled people who like to sit in their wheelchairs
and read, sell food, or repair watches and shoes. Many of them
just enjoy the flowers and sunlight.
</P>
<P>
They are victims of the earthquake that demolished the north
China city 20 years ago, killing 240,000 and injuring more than
500,000 people. It also left 3,817 residents permanently paralyzed
from the waist down. As a result, Tangshan has the most
paraplegics in China.
</P>
<P>
To ensure these disabled people enjoy their lives, the city
government has carefully supervised their jobs and living
conditions, and offered strong support for their well-being.
</P>
<P>
The local government provides additional financial support for
the city's disabled, in addition to their regular salaries and
benefits.
</P>
<P>
Currently, about 550 disabled people live in the state-run
convalescent hospitals, more than 2,400 are taken care of by their
own family members, and others live on their own.
</P>
<P>
The Tangshan convalescent home, located in the city's scenic
southern suburbs, has over one hundred paraplegic patients, who
live three to a room and have special nurses to see to their daily
needs. All the buildings are handicapped-accessible.
</P>
<P>
The disabled who live in the hospital formed an entertainment
troupe, and have performed in many cities across the country. They
also gave shows in Zhongnanhai, the seat of the Communist Party of
China and the State Council. A live performance at this level is
considered a great honor in China.
</P>
<P>
The city's disabled frequently gather for unique sports
events: their wheelchair basketball team has won many medals in
nationwide sports matches. Some of the disabled have participated
in several world games.
</P>
<P>
Many of the young disabled study foreign languages and have
acquired scientific and technological knowledge. Some are now
college and university graduates.
</P>
<P>
Yao Cuiqin used to be an outstanding dancer. She was 19 years
old when the earthquake hit in 1976. Though the quake destroyed
her dreams of going on stage, she does not have regrets about her
former career and has been writing fiction since the disaster.
</P>
<P>
Ge Zhuang, a garment factory worker, was in love with Liu
Lianzhong, who worked for an iron and steel company. Ge lost her
legs as a result of the quake, but Liu married her in spite of her
injuries, and several years later they had a baby girl.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Arafat to Visit Cairo for Talks with Mubarak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 19 (Xinhua) -- President of Palestinian National
Authority Yasser Arafat will arrive here Saturday for talks with
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, the Cairo press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The talks will focus on the outcome of Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu's visit to Cairo Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, who on many occasions vowed to take a tough line on
Arab-Israeli peace negotiations, seemed to have somewhat softened
his stance after his two-hour meeting with Mubarak during the
brief working visit.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference with Mubarak following their talks,
Netanyahu said that Israel would honor its agreements signed with
the Arabs including the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the 1991 Madrid peace conference is the main
framework for negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"We will stick to the terms of reference of the Madrid peace
conference," he said. "The terms of reference of Madrid are what
can united us around a common frame of reference."
</P>
<P>
But he said that there are "different interpretations" on the
land-for-peace principle and the way to apply it, indicating that
he still refuses to fully accept the principle, which has been the
basis for the Middle East peace process since its inception five
years ago.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu also reiterated his stance that Jerusalem will never
be divided again, though he said that the rights of Christians,
Moslems and Jews will be fully protected in the city.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians want Arab east Jerusalem as the capital of
their future independent state, while Netanyahu has said that
Jerusalem will remain Israel's eternal and undivisible capital.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak, however, expressed his satisfaction with his talks
with Netanyahu, saying that there are great hopes that the peace
process will continue.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the first Arab country to make peace with Israel, has
been playing a role as a mediator between the Jewish state and the
Arabs, particularly the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Arafat came to meet with Mubarak to coordinate their stances
last Sunday prior to Netanyahu's visit, the first to an Arab state
since he won the Israeli elections on May 29.

<HEADLINE> BOJ Likely to Raise Discount Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Japan (BOJ) will raise
its official discount rate by 0.5 percentage point to 1.0 percent
in the near future if the U.S. Federal Reserve Board hikes its
discount rate, the Mainichi Shimbun newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The rate hike, if implemented, will mark an end to the easy
monetary policy taken by the central bank since July 1991 to
counter the economic slump, the paper was quoted by Kyodo News
Service as saying.
</P>
<P>
BOJ last raised the key lending rate, charged on loans to
commercial banks, in August 1990.
</P>
<P>
The BOJ had cut the discount rate nine times during the latest
round of credit easing and brought it down from 6 percent to a
historic low of 0.5 percent last September.
</P>
<P>
BOJ Governor Yasuo Matsushita has repeatedly said that to
change the central bank's easy monetary policy, it is necessary to
confirm that the Japanese economy has entered a phase of
self-sustainable recovery led by private-sector demand, and recent
economic indicators have shown that private-sector demand is
increasingly gaining steam, helping Japan's steady economic
recovery.

</P>
<P>
one portion of the financial aid comes from the International

preliminary reforms and performance undertaken by the Yemeni
government with the support of the IMF and the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Yemeni minister pointed out that the Executive Directors
called upon the IMF to maintain its assistance to the current
reform operation in Yemen, thus, enhancing the prospects of
success of the program and obtaining further resources with
greater facilities.
</P>
<P>
He said that the IMF praised the Yemeni government efforts and
decisions in tackling the economic situation and in pursuing
successful steps in this field.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Steel Plant Is Shining Example of China Reforms (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 19 (Xinhua) -- A loss-making iron and steel
plant in China has been turned into a money-spinning 'gold mine'.
</P>
<P>
Now the once little-known Handan Iron and Steel Complex in
Hebei province, north China, is a shining example for state-owned
enterprises in the country's reform process.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year the Chinese State Council, the country's
central government, called on the whole country, money-losing
state enterprises in particular, to learn how to survive the
market economy by streamlining their organizations, transforming
technology, strengthening management and increasing efficiency and
economic control.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, the number of state-owned
enterprises in a poor financial state went up from 30 percent in
1994, to 40 percent last year, and 45 percent in the first half of
this year. It painted a grim picture for many of China's
giant 'workhorse' industries.
</P>
<P>
Serving as the pillar of the country's national economy,
state-owned enterprises have been forced to think deep and hard
about the way of reform. However, as a combined entity their
general debility has not been reduced.
</P>
<P>
Analysing the causes, experts agreed that this was because the
state enterprises have shouldered heavy burdens, and been forced
to struggle with worn-out and often obsolete equipment. Many of
them also become used to relying on the state for living. They
just waited for the state to reform, streamline and transform
them. When they ran into trouble their first thought was to look
to the state for help. They did not voluntarily strengthen their
own management structures, reduce production costs, or adapt
themselves to the market economy.
</P>
<P>
Wu Bangguo, vice-premier of the State Council, said that one of
the major causes why state-owned enterprises had a poor economic
efficiency, and some were even in the red, was because they have
not yet truly faced up the realities of a market economy. Neither
have they got rid of the modes of pre-reform conventional planning
management styles.
</P>
<P>
"To popularize the experience of the Handan Iron and Steel
Complex may help carry out the in-depth reform of state-owned
enterprises, and push them to the market," he said.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Steel Plant Is Shining Example of China Reforms (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Founded in 1958, the complex with a force of 28,000, had been
on a losing streak until 1990. Then it replaced the way of
counting the costs and and working out expected interest levels,
before setting prices for its products. It meant the plant was
able to fix acceptable market prices, and also work out its own
definitive production costs.
</P>
<P>
If a production unit, or individuals, surpassed production
costs, it was seen as failing to make a profit, thus affecting
bonuses and wages for its employees. If they reduced both
production costs and market prices, they were rewarded.
</P>
<P>
"This practice has helped foster a concept on marketing among
employees, and helped them to make careful calculations and strict
budgeting in their work," said Liu Hanzhang, general manager of
the Handan Iron and Steel Complex.
</P>
<P>
Although the prices on the steel market have fluctuated over
the past five years, the complex's output of steel rose from 1.1
million tons in 1990 to 2.15 million tons in 1995, and its profits
from one million yuan to 700 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
An economist from the Development Research Center, under the
State Council, said that the indexes of consumption of energy and
raw materials of China's major industrial products are 30 percent
to 90 percent higher than the advanced indexes of their overseas
rivals in similar industries.
</P>
<P>
"If China's enterprises can reduce their production costs by
five percent, and raise the rate of qualification and turnover by
five percent, their economic returns will go up by 25 percent," he
said.
</P>
<P>
By learning from Handan Iron and Steel Complex, the Anshan Iron
and Steel Complex in Liaoning province had set a record in the
production of steel and steel products in the first six months of
this year, and 21 large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises
reported having sound economic results after following in the
footsteps of the Handan complex.
</P>
<P>
An official at the State Planning Commission acknowledged that
some state-owned enterprises with better economic results are
taking a wait-and-see attitude towards the Handan Iron and Steel
Complex, and a few of the enterprises with operational
difficulties still dream of relying on state assistance.
</P>
<P>
In view of the situation, the People's Daily, China's biggest
national paper, has issued a number of commentaries and articles
urging enterprises to cast away illusions, and learn in real
earnest from the experience of the steel complex in a practical
way. By following the example of the once-struggling iron plant
they can steel themselves for survival in the market-oriented
economy.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Scientists of the Kenya
Agricultural Research Institute are decrying poor terms of
service.
</P>
<P>
Top researchers in the country claim that since the founding
of the institute in 1086, they have worked without a scheme of
service.
</P>
<P>
Scientists from various stations in Nairobi said at a recent
meeting here that their current terms of service are no different
from those of 10 years ago, according to the paper "Daily
Nation".
</P>
<P>
The scientists said there is no clear criterion on promotions
or insurance despite their having to travel extensively on duty.
</P>
<P>
They also complained that in the case of death or retirement,
their benefits are calculated on the basis of the job groups they
previously held in the ministry.
</P>
<P>
The scientists, many with doctorate degrees, claimed that
staff morale at the institute is at its lowest ebb and this,
combined with the poor terms, has triggered an exodus of top
scientists to other fields.
</P>
<P>
"Many professionals sponsored by donors for training abroad
did not return to the institute but sought better terms
elsewhere," a scientist was quoted as saying.

<P>
NEW DELHI, July 19 (Xinhua) -- In a bid to promote the concept
of a small family, the government of New Delhi is proposing a
legislation to make it mandatory for contestants to the Municipal
Corporation of Delhi Elections to have a maximum of two children,
a Delhi government official said here today.
</P>
<P>
The proposed legislation would render those having more than
two children ineligible to contest the municipal elections, he
quoted Delhi Health Minister Harsh Vardhan as saying.
</P>
<P>
Similar laws are reported to have already been enacted in a
number of cities in the country for the same purpose.
</P>
<P>
New Delhi's population has already surpassed 9 million and over
two million are being added in the capital every year, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the legislation, the Delhi health minister said that
it was an attempt to attract public attention to the population
explosion in the city as well as in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Delhi government would, through a resolution, ask the union
government to introduce necessary constitutional amendments to bar
those having more than two children from contesting the Delhi
assembly elections, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The local government would also ask the central government to
introduce such provision in all state assemblies, state councils,
Lok Sabha (lower house) and Rajya Sabha (upper house).
</P>
<P>
This would set a healthy example for the public to follow small
family norms, he added.

NANCHANG, July 19 (Xinhua) -- As water levels in stretches of
China's mighty Yangtze River pass danger levels, a massive one
million strong army of task force have been mobilized in east
China's Jiangxi Province.
</P>
<P>
They are fighting a race against time as the water level
continues to rise in the Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
Flooding caused by torrential rains has sent the Yangtze River
water level in Jiujiang, east China's Jiangxi province to 21.39
meters - 1.89 meters above danger level. In Poyang Lake the level
has reached 20.75 m, which is 1.75 m above danger level.
</P>
<P>
The water level is continuing to rise, posing a serious threat
to the safety of embankments along the Yangtze River and the lake,
according to local sources.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government is organizing energetic efforts to
fight against the floods. Over one million people have been
mobilized to deal with the situation. Various emergency teams,
rescue groups have been set up to repair or reinforce the
embankments and dykes.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Sudanese Refugees in Uganda Demand Transfer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese refugees in Achol-Pii
and Agago refugee camps at kitgum, over 300 kms north of Kampala
have asked the U.N. refugee body to transfer them immediately to
another part of Uganda.
</P>
<P>
"the New Vision" daily today quoted a memorandum issued by the
refugees on Tuesday as saying they demanded to be settled in a
safer place after rebels of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA)
killed 152 refugees in an attack on the two camps.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum said the rebels warned that they must quit the
camps, or else they would be transformed into battle fields with
Ugandan army.
</P>
<P>
The rebels were evicted from Sudan by Sudanese troops and the
Sudanese refugees would be killed to vacate "land for them", said
the memorandum.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Maj. Den. Salim Saleh, special
presidential advisor on military and political affairs in
northern Uganda disclosed that his government is recalling another
5,000 veterans to the battle field in fighting against the
rebels.
</P>
<P>
Because of last weekend massacre, he said, the peace talks
that he was ready to hold with the rebels were now definitely
dead.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Tightens Security After TWA Plane Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Following the Trans World
Airlines (TWA) Boeing 747 crash on Wednesday near New York City,
security has been tightened in places such as airports,
especially that in Atlanta where the 26th Summer Olympics is
opening Friday.
</P>
<P>
As officials declining to rule in or rule out terrorist bomb as
a possible cause of the plane's mid-air explosion that killed all
the 230 people aboard, law enforcement, intelligence and airport
officials have heightened alert.
</P>
<P>
As a terrorist task force investigates the possibility that the
explosion was an act of terrorism, security officials were taking
a hard look at measures in places prior to the opening ceremonies
of the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Because of the June 23 truck bombing of a military base housing
U.S. Air Force personnel at Dharan, Saudi Arabia, and similar
bombings at the World Trade Center in New York and Murrah Federal
Building in Oklahoma City, it is understandable that no one wants
to leave anything to chance.
</P>
<P>
In Atlanta, security restrictions were already in places
including invasion barriers surrounding the outside of the
airport, windows coated with anti-ballistic film to prevent them
from being shattered by gunfire and a noticeably increased police
presence in the city.
</P>
<P>
Airport officials said that more tightening of security is
possible.
</P>
<P>
As there were high speculations of terrorist bomb, President
Bill Clinton warned Americans today against jumping to conclusions
about what might have caused the crash of TWA Flight 800.
</P>
<P>
He referred to the apparently incorrect early speculation that
the April 19, 1995 bombing of a federal office building in
Oklahoma City might have been the work of foreign terrorists.
</P>
<P>
However, there have been signs of increasing anti-terrorism
measures in the country in recent days.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Clinton has reportedly ordered steps to safeguard
telecommunications, electrical power grids, gas and oil storage
and transportation as well as infrastructure related to banking
and finance, transportation, water supply, emergency services and
government operations.
</P>
<P>
He also ordered the creation of an inter-agency task force led
by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and including Pentagon
officials to cope with any such attacks.
</P>
<P>
The General Services Administration, which handles federal
office space, is moving to take away about 360-meter street
parking spaces around 19 high-profile buildings in the Washington
area to protect them from car bombs.

<HEADLINE> Israel Details Steps on Easing of Closure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli army late Thursday
night detailed steps to ease the five-month-long closure imposed
on the West Bank and Gaza Strip, announcing that more Palestinian
workers would be allowed into Israel.
</P>
<P>
According to an Israel Radio report this morning, 10,000 more
Palestinian labors will be permitted to return to their jobs
inside Israel, in order to enhance the dire economic situation in
the Palestinian autonomous areas.
</P>
<P>
The army's announcement followed Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's visit to Egypt, where he said Israel had planned to
lift some restrictions of the closure.
</P>
<P>
Israel imposed a total closure on the West Bank and Gaza Strip
following a wave of suicide bombing attacks inside Israel in
February and March, which killed at least 60 people and wounded
over 130 others.
</P>
<P>
The closure, which barred tens of thousands of Palestinians
from returning to their jobs inside Israel, has caused great
damages to the already troubled economic situations in the
Palestinian self-ruled areas.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army said in the announcement that the 10,000
Palestinian labors, over the age of 29 and married, are to be
added to the 25,000 already permitted to work in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another 500 labors are to be allowed into the Erez
industrial zone between the Gaza Strip and Israel, provided they
are at least 25-year old and married.
</P>
<P>
The announcement added that 350 more entry permits are also to
be handed out to merchants and 250 medical personnels are to be
allowed to enter Israel.
</P>
<P>
An additional 10 ambulances are to be allowed to cross into
Israel, and the Israeli army plans to ease the movement of trucks
from the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Body Launched </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Transparency International, an
organization that seeks to curb corruption in society was
launched in Zimbabwe on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Outspoken critic of the government and a lecturer at the
University of Zimbabwe, John Makumbe, is the interim chairman of
the Transparency International Zimbabwe (TIZ) which pledges to
wrestle rising corruption in both the private and public sectors.
</P>
<P>
A survey that preceded the launch of TIZ found out that two
thirds of the 200 people interviewed admitted to have been
involved in different forms of corruption.
</P>
<P>
In Zimbabwe, corruption normally comes in the form of abuse of
power and bribery, problems that have contributed to the rise in
white collar crime.
</P>
<P>
The government is in the process of amending the prevention of
corruption act to outlaw the acceptance of gifts by public
officers from people that they transact official business with.
</P>
<P>
A proposed amendment also seeks to compel public officers to
declare assets and will open them to scrutiny on personal
property they might purchase above what their salaries would
normally afford.
</P>
<P>
''To others corruption was purely functional because it
enables employees at low paid places to supplement their salaries
by asking for bribes, and thus sustaining one's family,'' a
summary of the survey said.
</P>
<P>
TIZ will form a coalition with representatives from
non-governmental organizations, schools, the media, private
companies and the government to highlight the detrimental effects
and damages caused by corrupt activities.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Welcomes Proposed Israeli Withdrawal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez
Boueiz, in an interview with a Beirut daily issued today,
welcomed a proposed Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon, but
doubted that the Jewish state had taken a decision on a "full"
pullout.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on recent remarks made by Israeli officials on a
unilateral withdrawal from southern Lebanon, the Lebanese foreign
minister stressed that if the withdrawal really takes place "we
welcome it."
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Al-Liwa daily, Boueiz said that
the withdrawal should "come within Resolution 425 and allow the
Lebanese authority to deploy the Lebanese army to the South and
to wield its sovereignty on all its territories.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Israel would benefit from the withdrawal
since it would "solve its security problem with Lebanon."
</P>
<P>
U.N. Security Council Resolution 425 calls for an
unconditional Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
However, the Lebanese foreign minister doubted that the Jewish
state had taken the decision on the "full withdrawal to the
internationally-recognized border" or was prepared to implement
this kind of withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
He believed that what Israeli officials meant was probably
"partial, tactical or embarrassing withdrawals, that is to say,
to withdraw from some small spots where the Israeli troops are
attacked by guerrillas."
</P>
<P>
He noted that this withdrawal "is useless for us."
</P>
<P>
Boueiz disagreed that the unilateral Israeli withdrawal would
lead to a separation of the Lebanese track from the Syrian one in
the peace negotiations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
"The Lebanese track is linked with the Syrian track in what
concerns the signature of a political peace agreement," he
clarified, "if the signature does not take place, there will not
be a separation between them."
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that without Syria Lebanon would not sign a
peace agreement with Israel and would not reach any political or
economic accord with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz underlined that Israel could not obtain the peace with
Lebanon unless it pulls out of the Lebanese land according to
U.N. Security Council Resolution 425.
</P>
<P>
After the withdrawal, he added, the Lebanese army would be
deployed to the South and maintain the security on the border.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister noted that his government had not
nominated any representative to a cease-fire monitoring committee
in southern Lebanon, which was provided for by a cease-fire
understanding reached between Lebanon and Israel on April 26.
</P>
<P>
The five member states of the committee, namely the United
States, France, Israel, Syria and Lebanon, recently agreed that
the committee's first meeting would be held at the southern
Lebanese coastal town of Naqura on July 25.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz said that the Lebanese representative to the committee
would be a "high-ranking officer in the Lebanese army because we
regarded the committee as a security one and the representative
should be a military officer."
</P>
<P>
He denied a linkage between the committee and the Israeli
withdrawal from southern Lebanon, noting that "the function of
the committee is to supervise the implementation of the April
understanding."

<HEADLINE> Israeli President Pardons Two Palestinian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 19 (Xinhua) -- President Ezer Weizman has
decided to pardon two Palestinian women prisoners in a move
to solve one of the sore points in Israeli-Palestinian
relations.
</P>
<P>
Weizman made the promise in a letter sent to Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
when the two met in Cairo Thursday to hold their first
meeting.
</P>
<P>
The two women, Anam Jabari and Mai Aljesin, are serving
long jail terms on charges of murdering Israelis. They are
to be released next week.
</P>
<P>
Jabari was sentenced to 12 years as a minor for murdering
a Jewish student in Jerusalem's Sacher Park eight years ago.
Aljesin, who stabbed a Jewish student near the Old city and
then murdered another prisoner while in jail, was sentenced to
life imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
The previous government led by former Prime Minister Shimon
Peres had promised Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President
Yasser Arafat that all 36 Palestinian women prisoners would be
freed.
</P>
<P>
However, Weizman then refused to pardon the two women. At
the same time, OC Central Command Ilan Biran declined to cut
short the prison terms of three other women prisoners.
</P>
<P>
The fate of the women has been one of the major
disputes between Israel and PNA. The latter charged Israel with
violating the Oslo Accords by refusing to release the women
prisoners.
</P>
<P>
In a show of solidarity, other women prisoners in Israeli
jails who are eligible for release opted to remain in
prison.
</P>
<P>
Weizman said that he decided to change his mind and agree
to pardon the two women several months ago, but delayed the
announcement until after the May elections.
</P>
<P>
Under the Oslo Accords, Israel will release several thousands
Palestinian prisoners in three stages. The final arrangements
are expected to be worked out in the final status talks,
opened in early May but delayed indefinitely due to Israeli
elections.

DAR ES SALAAM, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Three out of every four Dar

Cheyo, the Lands, Housing and Urban Development Minister.
</P>
<P>
Moving his ministry's 1996/97 budget estimates at the National
Assembly in Dodoma, Central Tanzania on Thursday, Cheyo said
housing becomes increasingly a major problem in urban areas and
the country is at present in shortage of 600,000 units.
</P>
<P>
He said many people are building houses in unplanned areas.
Official national records, he said, showed that 40-75 percent of
people in urban areas lived in unplanned settlements.
</P>
<P>
"75 percent of Dar es Salaam residents live in squatter areas
and 65 percent of construction of new housing units is currently
going on in those areas," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said in rural areas people lived in low quality
houses, many built by weak wooden poles, mud and grass thatched.
He said many lack a strong foundation and about half of them have
no good toilets.
</P>
<P>
Cheyo said the government would continue mobilizing the people
to build better houses using burnt bricks, tiles and other
locally available cheap building materials.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Liaoning
province has spent almost 500 million yuan on major anti-flood
measures after experiencing serious flooding for two successive
years.
</P>
<P>
This year officials are confident that the province has made
adequate preparations for the impending flooding season.
</P>
<P>
A total of 486 million yuan has been spent on restoring and
consolidating 13,800 anti-flood projects. So far work on 95
percent of the projects under the restoration plan has been
completed, according to Qu Lizheng, deputy commander-in-chief of
the provincial anti-flood headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Localities have been ordered to remove obstacles in major
rivers.
</P>
<P>
An anti-flood responsibility system for officials has been
introduced throughout the province. Provincial Governor Wen
Shizhen directly takes charge of one of the major projects.
</P>
<P>
At present, the responsibility system has been introduced in
more than 80 major reservoirs and 300 small reservoirs across the
province.
</P>
<P>
So far anti-flood departments at provincial level have prepared
300 rubber boats, 400,000 straw sacks, 100 tons of iron wire and
1,600 cubic m of wooden poles.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Blacks to Buy Shares in Parastatals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The National Investment Trust
will start helping Zimbabwean blacks buy shares in local state
enterprises and on the stock market in line with the black
economic empowerment bias in late 1996.
</P>
<P>
Minister of State in the President's Office responsible for
parastatals Cephas Msipa said on Thursday that seed money for the
venture should not be less than 5 billion Zimbabwe Dollars (500
million U.S. Dollars) if the trust is to be viable.
</P>
<P>
He said the government would provide part of the seed money
with the rest coming from funds that will be raised from the
privatized parastatals and traditional investors such as
insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
''The National Investment Trust should be in place by the end
of year, but it still has to be approved by cabinet. The seed
money should not be less than 500 million US Dollars if it is to
be viable,'' Msipa said.
</P>
<P>
He said the government would use private placement to buy the
shares from parastatals while blacks would buy shares on the
stock market through the trust.
</P>
<P>
The trust, an investment option for local entrepreneurs under
the second phase of the economic structural adjustment program,
is being set up to enhance the participation of the indigenous
population or blacks in the economy.
</P>
<P>
Msipa stressed Zimbabwe wants to avoid a situation where all
shares in privatized parastatals are sold to foreigners.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Fails to Persuade EU to Cut Tariffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Thailand has failed to persuade
the European Union (EU) to reverse its new duty concessions
program against Thai products, but the door for further
negotiations remains open, a senior Thai official said here on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The task was very difficult because the EU has made the
decision, Thai Deputy Foreign Minister Pracha Guna-Kasem said
after returning from Brussels where he held talks with EU leaders
on the issue.
</P>
<P>
The official said that Thailand had to find other measures to
lessen troubles for exporters.
</P>
<P>
The EU is introducing a new program under the generalized
system of preferences (GSP) which classifies Thailand as a
partially developed country and allows it only half the duty cuts
given to most developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Under the new GSP scheme, for example, the basic rate for Thai
processed shrimps is 7 percent, a reduction of 13 percent from
normal EU duty of 20 percent, but Thailand enjoys only half the
reduction, or 6.5 percent, making the duty at 13.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Tariff reductions under the new scheme are based on two
factors, that is, the sensitivity of the products and the degree
of development of the exporting countries.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers said that the new program, which will take
effect from January 1 next year, will affect 17 Thai products.
</P>
<P>
The EU began to grant Thailand the GSP privileges in 1971. The
old GSP rates were much lower than the new ones.

</P>
<P>
In just a few years places of interests related to Qu, a
well-known Chinese poet living more than 2,000 years ago, will be
submerged when the Three Gorges Dam is filled with water.
</P>
<P>
China is going to rebuild the places of interests, such as the
Qu Yuan Memorial Temple, in a park at the side of Yangtze
River. The site, just one kilometer to the west of the dam, is
expected to attract even more tourists.
</P>
<P>
Famous works of Qu Yuan are "Li Sao," a long poem, and "Chu
Ci," the poetry of the Kingdom of Chu. In 1953 he was listed by
World Peace Council as one of the four most renowned ancient
scholars in the world.
</P>
<P>
The patriotic poet, also a great thinker and statesman, threw
himself into river in 278 B.C. in despair over the capital of the
state of Chu.
</P>
<P>
Qu Yuan was born in Zigui County, in central China's Hubei
Province. The Qu Yuan Memorial Temple, a quadrangle consisting of
gate, a hall, wings of the hall and back chambers, was first built
in the year of 820 AD.
</P>
<P>
In 1976, the memorial temple was moved to Xiangjiaping, two
kilometers away from its original site, due to the construction of
the Gezhouba water-control project. The hall has stone tablets,
a bronze statue, a tomb containing Qu Yuan's clothes and
hats and a memorial hall.
</P>
<P>
With the construction of the Three Gorges Project, water will
submerge the hall for a second time. China plans to build Qu Yuan
Park to resettle the hall. The park is nearly 40 kilometers away
from the hall's present site.
</P>
<P>
Several places of interests related to the poet, such as
Reading Book Cave, Lepingli Memorial Archway, Lisao Building, will
also be set up.
</P>
<P>
The park, set against scenic gorges and a 185-meter-high dam on
Yangtze River, will be a magnet for more tourists, said Xiang
Qinjian, an administration official with Zigui county.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: France Seeks New Partnership With Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 18 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac's
latest African tour is seen by many as a part of a strategic bid
to woo the continent and establish a new Franco-African
partnership.
</P>
<P>
Chirac's three-day visit to Gabon and the Congo is the
president's third trip to Africa since his election as president
in May last year, indicating that the continent is now a foreign
policy priority for France.
</P>
<P>
If the two previous trips were aimed at mending fences with the
world's poorest continent, Chirac this time apparently harbored a
strategic intention of establishing a partnership with Africa.
</P>
<P>
France had traditionally enjoyed a special friendship with
Africa mainly due to old colonial ties. But its relations with the
region have suffered a series of setbacks in recent years due to a
steady reduction in aid from Paris and a backlash from France's
military intervention in Rwanda, the Comoros and the Central
African Republic.
</P>
<P>
Cuts in assistance in the early 1990s sparked strong discontent
among African governments. In 1995, aid shrank 9.3 percent over
1994 after a reduction of 8 percent compared with 1993.
</P>
<P>
The disgruntlement grew when Paris decided in 1994 to sever the
link between the French franc and the African franc, a move which
caused adverse repercussions on African economies.
</P>
<P>
France's self-appointed role as "military policeman" for
Africa, evidenced by its military operations in Rwanda, the
Comoros and the Central African Republic also triggered resentment.
</P>
<P>
Chirac began the process of mending fences shortly after his
election last year by readjusting France's Africa policy.
</P>
<P>
Two speeches during his latest visit best illustrate the
principles of his new Africa policy.
</P>
<P>
In a speech at the Gabonese University of Makusu, the French
president denounced "Afro-pessimism" and expressed confidence in
Africa's development potential. He said he had "faith in Africa,
its opportunities, its progress."
</P>
<P>
He appealed to developed countries for a more positive attitude
toward development in the Third World to avoid leaving it behind
the economic globalization process.
</P>
<P>
Chirac also criticized the United States for its position on
aid and declared that France would take the lead in helping Africa
and promised to speak for African countries in international aid
organizations.
</P>
<P>
"France is a champion of Africa wherever its future is on
line," he said.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Chirac wrote off 400 million francs (about 80
million U.S. dollars) of Gabon's foreign debt. At the same time,
the Paris Club of richest countries decided to wipe out 67 percent
of the Congo's debts.
</P>
<P>
If the speech in Gabon centered on aid and the economy, an
address today to the Congolese parliament in the capital
Brazzaville focused on politics.
</P>
<P>
Chirac condemned his predecessor Francois Mitterrand's position
of linking international development aid with democratization.
Instead, he advocated a democracy "tailored to Africa."
</P>
<P>
Africa should construct a democracy of its own characteristics,
he said.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the West to find new ground for cooperation and
mutual assistance with Africa so as to recognize and respect each
other's characteristics.
</P>
<P>
At last month's Lyon summit of the Group of Seven leading
industrialized nations, Chirac advocated a new partnership between
the West and the Third World. He also called on governments and
financial institutions to write off some of the developing world's
debt.
</P>
<P>
Chirac's pursuit of better relations with Africa is seen as
part of the effort toward building this new relationship.
</P>
<P>
However, he also realizes that a partnership with Africa is in
the interests of his own country. As he made clear in
Brazzaville, "to help Africa is to help us, because our products
need overseas markets."

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Opposition MPs Walk Out of House Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's new parliament has
witnessed another bedlam as opposition MPs walked out during the
current house session in protest against what they termed "denial
of the right of the opposition" to introduce adjournment motions.
</P>
<P>
The uproar started Thursday afternoon as soon as House Speaker
Humayun Rashid Chowdhury took his seat after the question hour and
gave the floor to Home Minister Rafiqul Islam for making a
statement on recent jailbreak incident in the Dhaka Central Jail.
</P>
<P>
When the home minister started making his statement, all MPs
from the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) shouted in
protest against the yielding of floor by the speaker, who they
believed had violated the rules of procedure. This was the second
walkout led by the BNP since the parliament began its first
session Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The BNP MPs staged their first walkout just minutes after the
opening of the session in protest against "the denial of the
right" of BNP MPs to move an adjournment motion before the
election of the new speaker.
</P>
<P>
Before leading the second walkout, which also joined by MPs
from the Jamaat-e-Islami, leader of the opposition and BNP
chairperson Begum Khaleda Zia said that the speaker "is supporting
one party" and was partial in his conduct of the house business.
</P>
<P>
Two MPs from the Jamaat-e-Islami resumed their seats soon
afterwards. But BNP MPs preferred keeping away from the rest of
the sitting.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina alleged that it seemed that the
opposition was not prepared to extend the hand of cooperation to
run the house smoothly. She requested the opposition to come back
to the house.

SHANGHAI, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Relatively better-off families in
Shanghai have set a new record by keeping in touch with their
immediate members, close relatives and friends around China.
</P>

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Approves New Welfare Reform Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives Thursday approved a bill designed to reverse
decades of anti-poverty policy, turning the federal guarantee of
assistance to the poor into a time-limited, work-oriented program
largely run by the states.
</P>
<P>
The measure, approved 256-170, is the House's third effort. Two
previous bills were vetoed by President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The vote was short of the two-thirds majority needed to
override a veto. The Senate was also debating on the bill.
</P>
<P>
The White House criticizes the Republican bill for including
the 59 billion dollars in savings it envisions over six years,
much of which come from food stamps and from eliminating benefits
to many legal immigrants. It also criticized the prohibition on
states using federal block grant money to provide vouchers for
benefits for children after their parents reach the time limits.
</P>
<P>
But even the Democratic version shared many features with the
Republican bill.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has urged the congress to send him a bill before recessing
in August.
</P>
<P>
He said the previous measures provided insufficient protection
for the most vulnerable Americans.
</P>
<P>
The bill would end a family's welfare benefits after two years
unless the able-bodied family head gets a job. It would limit
lifetime welfare benefits to five years per family while letting
states grant hardship exemptions for up to 20 percent of
recipients. It also would replace four major welfare programs with
block grants to states, which would get more freedom as to how they
spend the money.
</P>
<P>
In spite of general agreement between Republicans and Clinton
on the need to push welfare recipients toward work, differences
remain over the details.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Testifies on Videotape in Whitewater Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 18 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
denied today that he had appointed two rural Arkansas bankers to
state jobs in return for their financial support while he was
Arkansas governor.
</P>
<P>
"What is not permissible is to promise any official act or to
attempt to get any official act in return for a contribution, and
that didn't happen in this case," The Associated Press quoted
Clinton as telling jurors in his second videotaped Whitewater
testimony.
</P>
<P>
In a federal court trial in Little Rock, Arkansas, Herby
Branscum Jr. and Robert M. Hill, the owners of Perry County Bank,
are charged with concealing from the Internal Revenue Service more
than 50,000 dollars in cash withdrawals the Clinton campaign made
on the eve of the 1990 primary and general elections for
get-out-the-vote activities.
</P>
<P>
Also they are accused of misapplying bank funds by using the
bank's money to reimburse themselves and others for political
contributions, including checks to Clinton's 1990 campaign and his
1991 presidential exploratory committee.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors allege that the two bankers were motivated by a
desire to curry favor with the then state governor.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's testimony was taped July 7 at the White House.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he was aware that he owed more than 100,000
dollars to their rural Perry County Bank after the 1990 election,
which were not repaid until October 1992 after he named Branscum
to the Arkansas Highway Commission and reappointed Hill to the
Arkansas Banking Board.
</P>
<P>
However, Clinton insisted that the appointments had been made
because the two supporters were qualified, saying Branscum was
appointed because "I knew him and I trusted him and he had been a
good supporter of mine."
</P>
<P>
Clinton also testified in May in the trial of his two former
Whitewater business partners and Arkansas Governor Jim Guy
Tucker. That trial ended with fraud convictions for the three
defendants.

<HEADLINE> Ukrainian PM to Seek Aid From U.S. To Pay Wages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian Prime Minister Pavel
Lazarenko is to visit the United States to seek urgent financial
support to help pay hundreds of millions of dollars in wage
arrears to Ukrainian workers.
</P>
<P>
The country is facing a financial and social crisis as hundreds
of thousands of workers haven't been paid for months. Last week
the prime minister told parliament the government now owes 1.4
billion dollars in unpaid wages.
</P>
<P>
The situation is worsening and coal miners are on strike over
unpaid wages, estimated by trade unions at 600 million dollars,
causing serious energy shortages.
</P>
<P>
The crisis has been blamed by some for the attempted
assassination of Lazarenko last week in a car-bomb attack.
</P>
<P>
The visit will be the second high-ranking delegation to the
U.S. this year, following President Leonid Kuchma's visit in
February.
</P>
<P>
On July 29, the International Monetary Fund is expected to
discuss the progress in Ukraine's economic reform and its demand
for some 400 million dollars to pay old-age pensions and
salaries.

<HEADLINE> Canada Registers Record Trade Surplus in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Canada's trade surplus hit a record
high of 3 billion U.S. dollars in May, Statistics Canada reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Canada's exports continued to climb in May, growing 2.9 percent to
a record 16.4 billion dollars, while imports declined 2.1 percent
to 13.4 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Exports to the United States were robust, reflecting strong
consumer spending and industrial production there, while shipments
to all remaining major partners decreased.
</P>
<P>
Imports from nearly all of Canada's major trading partners fell
and those from the United States and countries outside of the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)
suffered the steepest declines, the federal fact-gathering agency
said.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said Canada's international trade figures
for May indicate that the country's economy is reviving and that its
unemployment rate will retreat from last month's 10-percent level.
</P>
<P>
The strong trade performance also generated a vote of
confidence from the financial markets today, sending the Canadian
dollar up 0.37 cent to 73.22 U.S. cents.

<HEADLINE> Nepali House Panel to Probe Overseas Job Brokers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 19 (Xinhua) -- A newly formed house panel in
Nepal is to probe into the activities of some local manpower
agencies which cheated Nepali workers by falsely promising
overseas jobs, the local press said today.
</P>
<P>
The five-member sub-committee, formed here Thursday under the
Public Accounts Committee of the Lower House, would submit a
report to the government within a month after consulting the Labor
Ministry, manpower suppliers and affected workers and families,
according to panel members.
</P>
<P>
recommendations for the solution to the problem would be
included in the report, they said.
</P>
<P>
Nepali workers often found them stranded in foreign countries
helpless after they were sent abroad by local employment agents,
who had charged them big amounts of money.
</P>
<P>
Many of the workers had been rendered into bankrupt after
paying the huge recruitment fees to the agents.
</P>
<P>
One member of the investigation panel claimed that even some
MPs and ministers were reportedly involved in the illegal
activities by fake manpower suppliers.
</P>
<P>
As Nepal has no concrete law on foreign employment to control
such activities, many youths from the country's rural areas become
victims of the fraudulent employment broker agencies, local
observers said.

TIRANA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Four Balkan countries -- Albania,
Macedonia, Yugoslavia and Greece -- will have another meeting next
week with the European Union and the World Veterinary Association
on how to halt the spread of the foot-and-mouth disease there.
</P>
<P>
Albania, which first found incidence of the disease in
southeastern Korca on May 22, has sealed off the area, destroyed
500 infected cattle and vaccinated 25,000 against the disease.
</P>
<P>
The EU has provided Albania with 600,000 vaccines worth about
740,000 U.S. dollars.

Macedonia, bordering Albania on the east, announced on July 1
that the disease hit an area near the capital city of Skoplje,
which was immediately closed and 3,000 sick cattle were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
Forty percent of the cattle in the border region between
Macedonia, Yugoslavia and Albania and more than 60 percent in the
Macedonian-Greek border region of Bitola have been vaccinated
against the disease.
</P>
<P>
Mihallo Zoric, head of Macedonia's veterinary bureau, said
Monday that the disease was almost under control in the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan Army and Tamil
rebels both suffered heavy casualties in a massive rebel assault
on the Mullaithivu army camp in the North Eastern coast of the
country on Thursday, according to informed sources here.
</P>
<P>
Military authorities, however, refused to divulge the exact
number of casualties suffered by the army in their long-drawn
confrontation which commenced in the early hours of yesterday, but
confirmed that both sides had suffered heavy losses and a couple
of hundred combatants had been killed in action, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Elite army troops were airlifted to reinforce the troops based
in Mullaithivu at about 4.30 p.m. yesterday and to assist in the
heavy fighting, the sources noted.
</P>
<P>
According to military sources, the army had been engaged in
fierce fighting with the rebels since the latter launched their
multi-pronged attack on the base where over 1,000 soldiers were
deployed.
</P>
<P>
The rebels had been able to penetrate many defenses from both
the northern and southern flanks using heavy mortar and machine
gun fire. However, navy and air force reinforcements had been able
to inflict heavy losses on the attackers and had foiled a plan to
launch a simultaneous sea-borne attack on the coastal defenses.
</P>
<P>
This attack by the Tamil rebels is considered to be one of the
biggest this year in the area.

ULAN BATOR, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Mongolian Socialist Democratic
Party's (SDP) leader Radnaasumberel Gonchigdorj has been elected
speaker of the Great Hural (parliament), local press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Gonchigdorj received two thirds of the votes in the first
session of the new parliament which was later adjourned in a row
over the election of deputy speaker.
</P>
<P>
The Revolutionary People's Party (RPP), which was toppled in
last month's general election after 70 years in power, wanted its
own candidate for deputy speaker, but the Democratic Union
Coalition, victors in the June 30 election, insisted on taking a
vote .
</P>
<P>
The coalition, which consists of the National Democratic Party,
the SDP and two small parties, won 50 seats in the 76-seat
parliament. The RPP won only 25 seats in the election, the second
parliamentary poll under a new constitution adopted in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Gonchigdorj, born in 1953 in the Province of Arhangay and a
graduate of the Mongolian State University, once served as vice
president and chairman of the Small Hural, the supreme and
standing body of state power, which is accountable to the Great
Hural.

<HEADLINE> China Makes Pioneering Work in Earthquake Reconstruction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Tangshan, a northern city
reduced to ruins by earthquakes 20 years ago, has become one of
the most quake-resistant cities in the country.
</P>
<P>
China has made marked achievements in the reconstruction of
earthquake-affected areas, according to an official of the
Ministry of Construction.
</P>
<P>
In 1990, the United Nations praised the municipal government of
Tangshan, in north China's Hebei Province, for making "outstanding
contribution to the development of human habitats."
</P>
<P>
According to Chinese officials, China has pioneered three modes
of reconstruction in quake-affected areas:
</P>
<P>
-- Reconstruction of buildings on their original sites in
cities that are not severely affected. Most of the buildings will
remain in use after they are consolidated.
</P>
<P>
-- Relocation of the cities when more than 90 percent of the
buildings are severely damaged. The new sites must be improved in
terms of natural conditions, geological conditions, conditions for
development and in other aspects.
</P>
<P>
-- Partial relocation when some basic facilities are of
practical value, although the cities are severely
damaged. Tangshan is a good example, consisting of an Old City
District, the Guye District and the Fengyun New District.

<HEADLINE> Guatemala Disbands Civil Patrols </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Guatemala this week began
disbanding its Civil Self-Defense Patrols (PAC), set up by the
government to fight the civil war against rebel guerrillas over
the last decade.
</P>
<P>
The move is part of peace negotiations between the government
and the National Guatemalan Revolutionary Unity Guerrilla movement.
</P>
<P>
The demobilization process, which affects 300,000 people began
after the National Plan for the Demobilization of Armed
Campesino (farmer) Groups came into force on July 15, reports from
Guatemala City said.
</P>
<P>
The PACs were created during the regime of President Efrain
Rios Montt (1982-83) as part of a strategy to fight the
guerrillas. They were formed by the Armed Campesino Groups and put
under the control of the Guatemalan Army.
</P>
<P>
The National Guatemalan Revolutionary Unity Guerrillas was set
up in 1982 and made of the Revolutionary Organization of the
People, Guerrillas Army of the Poor, the Army of Rebels and the
Military Commission of Labour Party.
</P>
<P>
The Guatemalan government and the guerrillas started peace
talks on ending the civil war and achieving national conciliation
in 1991. In 1995, both sides reached an agreement to protect the
rights of the indigenous Indians, who account for more than 60
percent of the total Guatemalan population.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Government to Spend 22% More Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The Colombian government
is still pursuing its austerity policies despite of a 22 percent
rise in spending to 29,400 billion pesos (24.1 billion dollars)
for fiscal 1997, the Finance Ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
Stripping out inflation, real growth in the budget will be
between three and four percent, Juan Carlos Ramirez, director of
the National Planning Department said.
</P>
<P>
The budget law bill will be studied tomorrow by the Economic
and Social Policies National Council (Conpes) and presented to
Congress next week.
</P>
<P>
The growth in spending is one of the lowest in recent years,
taking into account of the country's difficult financial situation,
Finance Minister Jose Antonio Ocampo Gaviria said.
</P>
<P>
The document foresees a central government budget deficit of
about 3.5 percent of gross domestic product and a one percent
deficit for the non-financial consolidated public sector.
</P>
<P>
According to budget projections, operating costs will rise 19.4
percent from from 12.7 billion dollars in 1996, to 15.2 billion
dollars in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The federal payroll will grow only 11.7 percent, going from 3.4
billion dollars to 3.8 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Half the budget will go to paying off the government's debts.
</P>
<P>
The repayment of public debt will grow 35 percent from 5.4
billion dollars to 7.3 billion dollars. Foreign debt servicing
will rise from 3.6 billion dollars in 1996 to 4.7 billion dollars
in 1997, soaring by 48 percent as the government pursues its
strategy of substituting domestic debt with foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
The government issued 1.1 billion dollars in bonds in the
foreign market during the first six months and plans to sell 200
million dollars more during the second half of the year.
</P>
<P>
Investment spending will increase by 10 percent to 4.8 billion
dollars, compared to 4.4 billion dollars budgeted for 1996.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
today called on the Russian army to become all-professional by the
year 2000, Itar-Tass reported today.
</P>
<P>
The president also ordered new defense minister Igor Rodionov
to stamp out corruption in the Russian armed forces.
</P>
<P>
"Corruption is eating away at the officer corps like rust,"
said Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
The president was speaking at a meeting of the Defense Ministry
at a sanatorium outside Moscow where he is resting.
</P>
<P>
He said the ministry leaders must keep in close touch with the
Russian Security Council led by Alexandr Lebed on all issues
concerning military reform.
</P>
<P>
The Russian president said he plans to establish a national
defense council to carry out the resolutions passed by the Russian
Security Council in respect of national defense and military
construction.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin urged Rodionov and his ministry to conduct deep-seated
military reform, including equipment, information and
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Russia's conscript army of just under two million is beset by
over-staffing at the top, lack of funds, out-dated equipment and
poor troop deployment.
</P>
<P>
"Deep military reform is needed," Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
Igor Rodionov, 59, who was named on Wednesday as the new
defense minister to replace Pavel Grachev, told a press conference
the military should set an example to the rest of the country as
regards corruption.
</P>
<P>
"The authority of the army cannot be maintained if its leading
ranks are corrupt," added Rodionov, who was a career soldier and
former commander of Soviet forces in Afghanistan.

<P>
NEW YORK, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Rescuers recovered more than 100
bodies from the waters off New York on Thursday, where 230 people
aboard a Paris-bound TWA plane exploded and went into the Atlantic
Ocean Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
Bodies and fragments of the plane were piled aboard Coast Guard
cutters along several miles off Long Island's coastline.
Refrigerator trucks were brought to East Moriches, where a
temporary morgue was set up, New York-New Jersey Port officials
said.
</P>
<P>
There was little hope of finding survivors from the ill-fated
airplane which burst into a fireball.
</P>
<P>
New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said on CBS television
that he and other city officials had been frustrated all night in
efforts to contact TWA executives. He criticized TWA for its delay
in confirming the identities of the passengers and crews on the
jumbo jet.
</P>
<P>
All American high-ranking officials declined to say whether it
is an accident or a terrorist act. But investigators, based on
eyewitness reports, are leaning more toward the possibility that
it was a bomb that caused the plane to explode.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that two crews of New York Air National Guard
flights witnessed the explosion. They saw the fireball twisting as
it came down, leaving a corkscrew trail of smoke.
</P>
<P>
Officials said there had been calls claiming responsibility for
the crash, but none of them credible.

years, but still needs to increase the quality of its products,
the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Construction of key State projects, such as expressways,
airports, power stations, hydro-electric dams and skyscrapers,
requires high-grade cement.
</P>
<P>
In 1978, the country's cement production was less than 65
million tons. Of 1994's production of 400 million tons, only
one-quarter was high-grade.
</P>
<P>
Last year, China's output of nearly 60 types of cement totalled
460 million tons, an increase of 15 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
During the Ninth Five-year (1996-2000), China will continue to
build more cement production lines with daily output surpassing
2,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The country's annual cement output is expected to reach 700
million tons by the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Shaanxi Plans to Do More for Women and Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Shaanxi, an inland province in
Northwest China, has mapped out a comprehensive plan to raise the
standard of living among women and children, reported today's
China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Between 1996-2000, Shaanxi will further entrench protection of
women's rights in political, economic, cultural and social
spheres, said Wei Zhangzhi, director of the Women and Children's
Rights Protection Office of Shaanxi's Provincial Women's
Federation.
</P>
<P>
As for children, health and education will be stressed, Wei
said.
</P>
<P>
The province will try to lower the infant and child mortality
rate, and new legislation will also mandate compulsory secondary
school education throughout the province by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
Due to an imbalance in economic and social development and
continuing influence of traditional ideas especially in poorer
areas, cases of infringement of women's rights have often occurred
in the past decade, said Wei.
</P>
<P>
To boost women's participation in government and politics,
women will be posted to all county and most township governments.
</P>
<P>
The plan also reiterates the equality of women in the
workplace, and identifies non-traditional areas of employment the
province will try to open to women.
</P>
<P>
"Before the end of 1998, 140,000 illiterate women will be
taught to read and write every year, wiping out illiteracy among
women in the province by 2000," Wei said.
</P>
<P>
He said the province will train 20,000 female farmer
technicians by the end of the century, and send at least one woman
technician for each village to advise local farmers.
</P>
<P>
The infant and child (five and under) mortality rates, 44.7 and
55 per thousand respectively in 1990, will hopefully be reduced by
one-third by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The province will ensure six-year compulsory education by the
end of 1997 and nine-year compulsory education by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
It is also planned that iodine deficiency among children should
be wiped out by the year 2000, Wei said.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Alarmed by the rise of dengue cases
in the metropolis, Philippine President Fidel Ramos ordered Metro
Manila mayors on Thursday to take action against the disease by
enforcing regular garbage collection and cleanup of waterways.
</P>
<P>
In a memorandum, Ramos directed Metro Manila Development
Chairman Prospero Oreta and the mayors to see "the connection
between dengue and garbage and pollution of our waterways."
</P>
<P>
The president has already ordered Health Secretary Carmencita
Reodica to take more aggressive action on the spread of the dengue
fever.
</P>
<P>
Asiaweek reported recently that dengue was on the rise also in
Indonesia and Malaysia, saying the epidemic is so serious that it
has replaced malaria as the number one mosquito-borne viral
infection in the world.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines has seen a 363 percent increase in the number
of the dengue cases since last year.

ROME, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Police have captured 30 kilograms of
heroin in Rome and 25 kilograms more in Milan in recent days,
thanks to information provided by Mafia members who turned
themselves in, the local press reported.
</P>
<P>
Two suspects were arrested at the DaVinci International Airport

billion lire (about 6.5 million U.S. dollars).
</P>

The drugs captured in Milan were of high purity and could sell
for 100 billion lire (about 65 million dollars) on the market.
Five drug traffickers were arrested in connection with the case.
</P>
<P>
Italian police have improved their efficiency in cracking down
on drug trafficking as more and more Mafia members have
surrendered in recent years and they began to cooperate with
police in exchange for clemency.

<P>
BUCHAREST, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Romanian President Ion Iliescu
today hailed the decision of the U.S. House of Representatives to
grant permanent Most-Favored-Nation (MFN) status to his country.
</P>
<P>
The decision by the U.S. Congress was described as a victory
for Romanian foreign policy by Romanian Social Democratic Party
Executive Chairman and Chamber of Deputies Speaker Adrian Nastase.
</P>
<P>
Nastase said that he hoped the U.S. Senate will also vote for
the resolution soon.
</P>
<P>
The United States did not grant MFN status to Romania until
1993 in spite of Romania's efforts to secure the preferential
tariff treatment since the dramatic political changes in the
country in 1989.
</P>
<P>
Dissatisfied with the 1993 decision, Romania began lobbying
for a permanent MFN status.

<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The Development Zone of Laocheng
(Old Town Site), on the island province of Hainan, is attracting
investments at a fever pitch.
</P>
<P>
The Hainan Port Office, located in the suburbs of this island
capital, is working in cooperation with a Canadian company to
build two ports for 35,000 dwt ships and two ports for 10,000 dwt
ships, that are aimed at promoting the zone's development.
</P>
<P>
The Jinxin Holiday Resort, funded by a joint investment from
Singaporean and Chinese companies, will be completed in the zone
at the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Over the past eight years, the Laocheng Development Zone has
worked to improve its investment environment. Six ports have been
built, and 1,000 program-controlled telephones put into use. In
addition, another 10,000 program-controlled telephones will be
installed.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China's Real Estate Peps Up in Second Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Statistics for the second quarter
indicate that the real estate sector is moving closer to recovery
although sales remain slack and competition is getting rougher,
according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The latest issue of the China Real Estate Index (CREI) covering
the April to June period reports that of the 15 cities surveyed,
property prices continued to dip, but not as much as in the first
quarter of the year.
</P>
<P>
"The market is bottoming out, especially in cities with strong
geo-economic position," the summary report said.
</P>
<P>
The index for Beijing, Dalian and Shenzhen rose from the first
quarter of the year, with Beijing up 6 points to 1,090 points, The
points represent property prices as compared with other cities.
</P>
<P>
In the other cities surveyed, the index for Changzhou stayed
almost the same as the fist quarter, and figures for Tianjin,
Wuhan, Xi'an, Chengdu, Chongqing, Liuzhou, Zhengzhou, Shijiazhuang
and Wuxi dipped.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai, in particular, was down by 11 points due to policy
changes in May concerning land lease and tax deductions.
</P>
<P>
The report said that it will be difficult for property prices
to drop further by a considerable rate, unless policies force the
market to do sa.
</P>
<P>
It attributed the property price hike in Beijing, Dalian and
Shenzhen to confidence among developers as the economic forecast
for the coming months of the year looks robust.
</P>
<P>
"Though leveling off, the market will come to a moderate climax
as the country's overall economic situation is improving," the
report said.
</P>
<P>
During the past three months, the national economy showed
strong momentum with gross domestic product and fixed asset
investment in the period estimated to have grown by around 10
percent and 14 percent, respectively, from last year.
</P>
<P>
Infrastructure spending was projected to have grown by 10
percent while the retail price index dropped to approximately 8
percent.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the interest rate cut enacted on May 1 and
measures to make the Renminbi freely convertible on the current
account before the end of the year contributed to rosier economic
prospects for the rest of the year.
</P>
<P>
But the recovery is expected to be marked by an increasingly
mature market and more intense competition, and the report
suggested that real estate companies use the time to improve their
development strategy and product mix.
</P>
<P>
Bucking the market slump, the report said, developers found the
business profitable when they were sensible in choosing projects,
flexible in their operation and managed their properties well.
</P>
<P>
Excessively high prices remains the most difficult problem
before the market can recover on the whole, the report said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 19 (Xinhua) -- China produced 62.62 million tons
of fertilizer in the first half of this year, 11 percent over the
same period last year, according to the Ministry of Chemical
Industry.
</P>
<P>
However, the ratio of sales to production is low, and
fertilizer inventories have risen to more than 23 million tons
this year, up 55.9 percent from same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Imports of fertilizer have also risen to seven million tons, an
increase of 7.4 percent over the corresponding period in 1995,
ministry sources said.
</P>
<P>
Fertilizer is pivotal to successful grain production. The
Chinese government has given priority to production and adequate
supply of fertilizer to farmers, as a major means of bolstering
agricultural production and raising grain output.
</P>
<P>
To control the soaring prices, the government is working out
procedures to set ceilings on prices of chemical fertilizer in
order to protect the farmers' interests.

living among women and children in the coming five years, said a
leading official in charge of women and children rights.
</P>
<P>
Between 1996-2000, Shaanxi will further entrench protection of
women's rights in political, economic, cultural and social
spheres, Wei Zhangzhi was quoted as saying in today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The province wants to lower the infant and child morality rate,
said Wei, director of the Women and Children's rights Protection
Office of the Provincial Women's Federation.
</P>
<P>
New legislation will also mandate compulsory secondary school
education throughout the province by the end of this century.
</P>
<P>
Though progress has been made on these fronts in the past
decade, a lot remains to be done, he said.
</P>
<P>
Due to an imbalance in economic and social development and
continuing influence of traditional ideas especially in poorer
areas, cases of infringement of women's rights have often occurred.
</P>
<P>
To boost women's participation in government and politics, at
least one woman will be posted to all county and most township
governments.
</P>
<P>
The plan also reiterates the equality of women in the
workplace, and identifies non-traditional areas of employment the
province will try to open to women.
</P>
<P>
Before the end of 1998, 140,000 illiterate women will to taught
to read and write every year, Wei said.
</P>
<P>
Wei added that the province will train 20,000 female
farmer-technicians by the end of the century, besides training
20,000 female managers over the five years.
</P>
<P>
The infant and child mortality rates, 44.7 and 55 per thousand
respectively in 1990, will hopefully be reduced by one-third by
2000.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government also plans to establish 100
provincial level demonstration kindergartens and other
non-demonstration classes to provide pre-school education to 50
percent of 3-5-year-olds in the period.

<HEADLINE> Olympians Sign for Global Campaign against Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- An unprecedented record was set on
Wednesday in the Atlanta Olympic Village when a tidewave of
athletes filled with signatures upon a giant board installed at
the recreation center.
</P>
<P>
It was a response to the global campaign launched by the
International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the United Nations
Development Program (UNDP) to drive against today's number one
killer of poverty.
</P>
<P>
The world's sport elite was so earger that it was impossible to
prevent athletes from signing before the arrival of the Village
mayor Russ Chandler who inaugurated the panel together with
Swedish European champion swimmer Linda Olofsson and athletes from
Comoros.
</P>
<P>
Many more athletes are expected to sign the board daily during
the Centennial Olympic Games to be opened on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Currently, 1.3 billion people still live in absolute misery,
with the majority in the developing countries, and every three
seconds a child dies.
</P>
<P>
The appeal of the Olympians calls for additional resources
for local action as well as more development aid.
</P>
<P>
The campaign is aiming at making the 1996-2006 a decade of
visible changes "so that ultimately no child will go without an
education, no human being will be denied primary health care or
safe drinking water, and no one will be condemned to go hungry."

<HEADLINE> Seles to Do her Best at Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- World joint number one tennis
player Monica Seles said in a press conference here this afternoon
that she would do her best at her first Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Seles, who returned to tennis last August after being stabbed
in Germany three years ago, has been plagued with shoulder
injuries these months.
</P>
<P>
"The shoulder is the same. It won't be better until I have
surgery," she said, "I will play the best I can."
</P>
<P>
Responding to the question on the absence of Steffi Graf, she
said:" I don't think my chances are better or worse."
</P>
<P>
Graf, a world joint number one player from Germany, was forced
to pull out of the Olympic Games with a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
Seles met Graf once after her return. At the final of the U.S.
Open last year, Seles suffered a defeat from her German
arch-rival.
</P>
<P>
With the absence of Graf, Seles is the top favourite for the
Olympic title.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav-American player, who had a nightmare about the
safety in competitions, said she had no doubt that it would be
safe at the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
"I am sure the security will be unbelievable," she commented.

<P>
CARACAS, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Nine kidnapped children in
Venezuela were rescued when police broke up a child-trafficking
ring in the city of Maracaibo, in the state of Zulia, newspapers

<HEADLINE> Oman Expects Sharpshooter to Make History in Atlanta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Oman, a small Arab nation, said
today that it hopes its sharpshooter will write the nation's
history at the Atlanta Olympic Games by taking home a medal.
</P>
<P>
Saud A. Makhmari, leader of the Oman Olympic delegation, said
his country has sent four athletes to compete in the Atlanta
Games, but they believe only their rifle shooter has a chance for
a medal.
</P>
<P>
He said K. Alkhajri, their star shooter, is a gold medalist of
Arab Championships and his best score record is 598 out of 600
points.
</P>
<P>
Alkhajri first competed in the Barcelona Games four years ago,
but he was only practising at that time, said Makhmari. "This
time he is much better."
</P>
<P>
Makhamri said Alkhari is the only athlete in the Oman team who
qualified for the Olympic Games through international competition.
</P>
<P>
He said Oman's other three athletes are scheduled to compete in
swimming, athletics and cycling.
</P>
<P>
Oman, with a population of 1.8 million, first sent athletes to
the Olympic Games in 1984, a team of nine shooters and seven track
and field athletes. It also sent athletes to the Olympic Games in
1988 and 1992. But the best performance of its athletes was an
eighth finish in the 400 meters race by Mohammed Malty in 1988.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- After 24 years of absence,
Cambodia is finally able to send five athletes to compete in the
Atlanta Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Runyi Prum, chief of the Cambodian delegation, said he does not
expect any medals from his five athletes, who will compete in men's
marathon, wrestling, women's sprint and both men's and women's
swimming.
</P>
<P>
"We have three objectives," Prum said. He said their first
objective for coming to Atlanta is to "rejoin the international
Olympic family". He said his country last participated in the
Olympic Games in 1972.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia also participated in the Tokyo Olympic Games in 1964
and the Melbourne Olympic Games in 1956. This is the country's
fourth time in the Olympic games.
</P>
<P>
Prum said before they came, they printed a large number of
T-shirts with the slogan: "We Are Back." They intended to pass
them around here, but the box containing the T-shirts got lost on
their way here.
</P>
<P>
Prum said their second objective is to raise their national
flag and the third, to make friends with athletes from all over
the world.
</P>
<P>
"Participation will let our athletes, especially the young,
learn from the world's best sportsmen and gain experience in
international competition," Prum said.
</P>
<P>
He said his country will send a much larger team to the next
Asian Games, with a soccer team, a basketball team and a
volleyball team.

<HEADLINE> Inner Mongolia Maps Out Development Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 19 (Xinhua) -- North China's Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region launched a series of massive projects for
economic co-operation and overseas investment Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The region is proposing 55 projects with the intention of
bolstering its economy during the Ninth Five-Year Plan
(1996-2000), today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The projects include such sectors as energy, metallurgy,
electronics, machinery, chemicals and pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
The autonomous region, endowed with a vast land area and rich
natural resources, aims to intensify efforts to develop four
pillar industries and three key sectors, the paper quoted Bao
Wenfa, vice-chairman of the region as saying.
</P>
<P>
The four pillar industries include metallurgy, energy,
machinery and electronics, and processing, which involves
agricultural and livestock products like wool, leather, and
food. And the three key sectors are chemicals, building materials
and forestry.
</P>
<P>
"The central government will further implement industrial
policies favoring basic industries including agriculture, water
conservation, energy and communications during the 1996 to 2000
period. This will be very beneficial to Inner Mongolia." Bao said.
</P>
<P>
The region, which boasts verified coal deposits of 210 billion
tons, one-fourth of the nations' total, and 77 percent of the
world's verified deposits of rare earth, aims to keep a growth
rate of around 10 percent in the next five years with GDP reaching
132 billion yuan by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
To achieve the goal, the region has launched five strategies to
make full use of its natural resources, he said.
</P>
<P>
It will accelerate economic development by opening up wider to
the outside world, rejuvenate itself with advanced technology and
education, tap the potential of human resources, and enhance
industries with brand-name products.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Hopes to Build Dominance in Long Distance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- A top official of the world's long
distance powerhouses Ethiopia said here today he hoped the
country's self-projected four medals in long distance at the
Atlanta Games will help it build dominance in the discipline.
</P>
<P>
Makasha Yifru, head of the Ethiopian delegation, said 16 of the
18 athletes from his country are to compete in marathon, 10,000
meters, 5,000 meters, 1,500 meters and 800 meters, with the other
two in boxing.
</P>
<P>
"Ours is a small team, but a strong one," Yifru said.
</P>
<P>
He said Ethiopian runners have the potential to win medals in
both the men's and women's 10,000 meters, women's 5,000 meters and
men's marathon. "We expect four gold medals, for the best," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopians won a gold and two bronze medals at the
Barcelona Games. In preparation for the coming games, Ethiopian
runners got into serious training as early as last November.
</P>
<P>
"They got together and went to areas high above the sea for
altitude training and to hot places to get prepared for the heat,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia has been a dominating force in distance events since
the Melbourne Olympics in 1956, though in recent years other
African countries are catching up.
</P>
<P>
Yifru said he hopeds the medals Ethiopian athletes might get in
Atlanta will help his country build dominance in distance running.
But he said Ethiopian athletes are also diversifying into other
sports.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia already has trained cyclists at home, but they did not
qualify for the games. It is also training athletes for
steeplechase and walking.
</P>
<P>
"We will be ready in Sydney," Yifru said. "But we only send top
athletes to the Olympic Games, not all our athletes even if they
are qualified."

<HEADLINE> News-Analysis: Chirac Aims to Build New </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 18 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
today wound up a three-day visit to Gabon and Congo. This is his
third visit to Africa since he became president a year ago.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, which is esteemed by French media as very
successful, Chirac gave his African hosts a wholesale of his new
ideas and plans to develop Franco-African ties that are strikingly
more economically-oriented than his predecessor, Francois
Mitterrand.
</P>
<P>
Chirac also has made clear his intention to build a strategic
and new partnership with Africa that is closely connected with his
efforts to revive the French economy at home.
</P>
<P>
France, a traditional ally of Africa's French-speaking
countries, has been criticized in the past few years by some
African countries for lowering economic and financial aid,
abolishing in 1994 the fixed exchange rate between the French
franc and African franc, and military interventions in Rwanda, the
Comoros and the Central African Republic in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Since his coming to power, Chirac has adjusted France's African
policy that can be noted on two major issues: an increased effort
to mobilize industrialized countries to offer economic and
financial aid to Africa, and replacing Mitterrand's policy
stressing the building of democracy with a more realistic appeal
for strengthening law and order by African states.
</P>
<P>
In a speech on economic development made in the University of
Sciences and Technologies of Masuku in Gabon, Chirac said he was
fully confident in Africa's future. He cited the fact that Africa
has seen a 5 percent rise of product in the past two years on the
run and that more and more African countries are getting rid of
deficit in their budgets.
</P>
<P>
He said that developed countries should not morally stay aloof
from Africa's misery as is shown by the fact that more than 200
million people there are living with less than one French franc
(20 U.S. cents) a day. "Do not construct the world without
Africa," Chirac was widely quoted as saying by the French media.
</P>
<P>
In a speech today to the parliament of Congo, Chirac said that
one should not "give lessons of democracy", but should "inspire
desire for democracy".
</P>
<P>
This is in reference to a policy made by Francois Mitterrand at
the Francophone Summit in Baule in 1990, which preconditions the
building of democracy by African states to the provision of aid by
France.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said that this policy has led some African countries to
put up masks of democracy and build "democracy of facade". He said
that it is more important to nourish a sense of "tolerance and
humility" for African states, and to build a "democracy of
Africa's own color".
</P>
<P>
The president also made it clear that France from now on would
put more emphasis on economic performance of African countries
instead of "political" performances. He said that at the next
Francophone Summit in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, to be held in
December, France will appeal to African countries concentrate on
the building of "good government" of their economies.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chirac also said that one should "end by force or
state power all the putschs, juntas, pronunciamentos, and all
violent actions" in Africa, and he praised some African states for
"having denied the old image of violence, feudalism, prebend and
</P>
<P>
The president is also very frank to tell France's interests in
developing a new partnership with Africa:"When we help Africa, we
are helping ourselves.... America gained more than it spent" in
carrying out the Marshall Plan after World War II.

<HEADLINE> Positive News on Interest Boost N.Y. Stocks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Share prices of the New York
Stock Exchange surged Thursday amid positive news on interest
rates, with the Dow Jones industrial average rising 87.30 points
to end at 5,464.18.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three days the Dow Jones industrial average has
regained more than two-thirds of Monday's 161-point loss.
</P>
<P>
Broader market averages also advanced on comments by Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan that interest rates may hold
steady for a time.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by nearly a 3-to-1
margin on the New York Stock Exchange, where its volume totaled
469.65 million shares, as against 428.37 million in the previous
session.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index rose 5.00 to 345.10, and the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index rose 9.50 to 643.57.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index jumped 21.71 to 1,108.36, and the
American Stock Exchange's market value index rose 11.64 to 551.63.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan, testifying before Congress, said the Fed would
likely raise rates in the future if necessary to attack inflation.
But he left his options open, noting inflation has remained
inactive.
</P>
<P>
The other factor helping stocks was corporate profits. Positive
earnings news from Merck &AMP; Co., McDonald's Corp., Apple Computer
Inc. and others helped bolster the market.

<HEADLINE> France Proposes New Model for Eurocorps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 18 (Xinhua) -- France has proposed a new model for
the Eurocorps after it decided to withdraw most of its troops from
Germany by 1999, said a report of Le Monde daily for its Friday
edition.
</P>
<P>
The report, written by the daily's military correspondent
Jacques Isnard, said that France would change its way of joining
the Strasbourg-based Eurocorps, which Paris has set up together
with Germany for peace-keeping and humanitarian missions under the
auspices of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
France will withdraw all but about 3,000 of its 20,000 troops
stationed in Germany by 1999, which includes the powerful First
Armored Division, made up of modernized AMX-30B2 tanks and manned
by 15,000 soldiers.
</P>
<P>
This division is considered to be France's strongest army on
the other side of the Rhine River, and is the pillar of France's
contribution to the Eurocorps, which also has a German armored
division, a Spanish motorized brigade (stationed at home) and a
Belgian motorized division (stationed at home).
</P>
<P>
By 1999, only one French regiment -- the 42nd Regiment of
Transmission -- will remain in Germany, which will be transfered to
Laval, Mayenne.
</P>
<P>
The report said that France now plans to compensate for the
withdrawal with the stationing of a 15,000-man armored division--
not in Germany, but in the eastern part of France -- as a part of
the Eurocorps.
</P>
<P>
This division will be the survivor of the military
restructuring that will begin in 1997, which plans to keep 85
regiments of the French army.
</P>
<P>
France has also proposed to Germany turning Eurocorps into a
more flexible and lighter in scale force by adding some helicopter
units to it and building it around a couple of intervention units.

<HEADLINE> Serbs in Eastern Slavonia Call for Extension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The assembly of the Serb region
of Eastern Slavonia today called on the U.N. Security Council to
extend mandate of the U.N. Transitional Administration in Eastern
Slavonia (UNTAES) for another year.
</P>
<P>
UNTAES began its one-year mandate on January 15, 1996 under
U.N. Security Council resolution 1,037 and an agreement reached
between Croatian authorities and Serb officials in the region last
November which entitles either side to call for a 12-month
extension of UNTAES mandate.
</P>
<P>
The Serb region of Eastern Slavonia is located in the
northeastern Croatia bordering Yugoslavia with Serbs as majority.
It is the only one of the four regions of the Republic of Serb
Krajina that Croatia has not occupied. The Croatian government
forces seized most of Serb Krajina in its attacks on it in May and
August 1995.
</P>
<P>
Serbs in Croatia proclaimed their own state, the Republic of
Serb Krajina, in 1991, after Croatia launched its war of secession
from the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The assembly called on the Security Council to persuade Croatia
to alter its amnesty law which it said was "partial, selective and
unobjective," Yugoslav news agency Tanjug reported from Vukovar, a
major city in the Eastern Slavonia region.
</P>
<P>
The assembly also pointed out that about 500,000 Serbs had fled
Croatia since the outbreak of the war, 250,000 were driven out of
their home in summer of 1995. Most of them have seek asylum in
Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Asia Improves A Lot at Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The level of the Asian sports has
improved a lot in the recent years and become more and more
important to the Olympic family, Deputy Chef de Misson of the
Thailand Olympic delegation said.
</P>
<P>
"I am delighted with the development of the Asian sports," said
the Deputy Chef de Mission Santiparb Tejavanija on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Asian sports were in the low position in the past, and most of
medals were taken by Europeans and Americans in both the Olympic
Games and world championships. But now we are getting better and
are among the bests in some events," he continued.
</P>
<P>
Thailand, which won a boxing bronze medal at the last Olympics
in Barcelona, sent 39 athletes to participate in nine sports
including athletics, swimming, boxing, Judo, shooting, badminton,
yachting, table tennis and weightlifting.
</P>
<P>
To take a boxing gold medal is the goal of the Thai delegation.
"We are hopefully to win more than one gold in some small classes
of boxing. As in the men's 200-meter breaststroke swimming and
badminton, we are also capable of winning medals."

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Dismisses Bombing Report as Ludicrous </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Defense Department on
Thursday dismissed a report that says Iran has trained and armed
Saudi Islamic fundamentalists and gave them go-ahead orders to
blast with a truck bomb a compound housing American soldiers at a
Dhahran military air base in Saudi Arabia last month.
</P>
<P>
The report made by the House Task Force on Terrorism and
Unconventional Warfare, an ad hoc panel with no real legislative
powers, says the explosion in Dhahran that killed 19 American
soldiers in June 25 was carried by Saudi terrorists linked to
Hezbollah, the Shiite Muslim militant group financed and armed by
Iran and aided by Syria.
</P>
<P>
Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon said it was too early to speculate
on who is responsible for the truck bombing. And another Pentagon
official went further describing the report as being "ludicrous".
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon and FBI which are investigating the Dhahran blast
with Saudi officials have not yet publicly linked the bombing to
any specific group.
