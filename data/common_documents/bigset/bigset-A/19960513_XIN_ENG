<HEADLINE> League Champ Upset by Guangzhou in China Soccer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Title holders Shanghai Shenhua was
upset by Guangzhou Apollo 3-2 while league leader Dalian Wanda had
their four game winning streak snapped at the fifth round
competition of China's soccer league on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai suffered this year's first defeat after three wins and
one draw in the previous rounds.
</P>
<P>
The Apollo surged to a 2-0 lead early in the game when Peng
Weiguo and Tan Ende stroke unanswering goals respectively in the
8th and 9th minutes.
</P>
<P>
In the 30th minute, the visiting Shanghai cut it 2-1 when
forward Xie Hui sent the ball home in front of the goal mouth.
</P>
<P>
But only seven minutes later, Guangzhou went further ahead with
a penalty kick by Peng Weiguo.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai Shenhua dominated the play in the second half with
their strong offence but Shen Si's goal in the 35th minute was not
good enough to save the defending champions from the surprising
defeat.
</P>
<P>
Last year's runner-up Beijing Guo'an also had a setback by
bowing down to Shandong Taishan 3-1 in Jinan.
</P>
<P>
Striker Tang Xiaocheng scored the league's fastest goal just 32
seconds from the kick-off and the solid-defencing hosts held the
1-0 lead throughout the first half.
</P>
<P>
Tang scored the second goal for Shandong in the second half in
an anti-attack fastbreaking at the 54th minute. Veteran defender
Su Maozhen added the third for Shandong with a header on a corner
pass some 10 minutes later.
</P>
<P>
Beijing, ranked fourth in the previous rounds, pulled one goal
back with a long shot by Gao Hongbo in the closing minutes.
</P>
<P>
The Dalian Wanda, led the ranking with 12 points from four
outings, could not carry their winning streak over the aggresively
attacking Guangzhou Songri, who were winless in the first four
rounds with tow draws and tow loses.
</P>
<P>
The other scoreless game on Sunday was between Shenzhen and
Guangdong Hongyan.
</P>
<P>
In Chengdu, Sichuan, the Sichuan Quanxing celebrated their
first win after three draws and one defeat, beating the visiting
Yanbian Hyunda 2-1 with goals from He Bing and Zhou Yougen in the
50th and 60th minutes, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Gao Zhongyuan scored the only goal for Yanbian in the 74th
minute.
</P>
<P>
In Sunday's only one-sided game, the Chinese Army handed a
routing 4-0 defeat to Tianjing Sumsung 4-0, who were in the bottom
of the 12-team rankings with one draw and four loses.

<HEADLINE> 24 Parties in Northern Ireland to Contest Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 12 (Xinhua) -- A total of 24 political parties in
Northern Ireland will contest the elections on May 30 and they
have fielded 329 candidates in the 18 constituencies in the
province, reported the Irish Times newspaper.
</P>
<P>
According to the 1996 Electoral Register, the total electorate
in Northern Ireland is 1,177,000.
</P>
<P>
The ballot papers will list only the names of the parties and
independents contesting the elections.
</P>
<P>
And voters will be required simply to place a single "X" on the
ballot paper beside the name of the party they wish to support.
</P>
<P>
The election plans unveiled by the British government last
March stipulates that the peace forum in ULster produced through
the elections will be composed of 110 members.
</P>
<P>
The total 18 constituencies in the province are each to elect
five members on a proportional representation system based on a
party list.
</P>
<P>
Another 20 seats will be awarded on a deliberately
non-proportional basis.
</P>
<P>
After 90 delegates have been elected from the 18
constituencies, the aggregate of votes gained by each party
throughout Northern Ireland will be calculated, and the top 10
parties will allocated a further two seats each.
</P>
<P>
The nomination of candidates came to an end last Thursday. The
Chief Electoral Officer Pat Bradley said that five of the parties
listed in the British government's election legislation as
eligible to participate did not submit any nominations.
</P>
<P>
And nominations lodged by two other parties were deemed
invalid.

<HEADLINE> UK Hardens Attitude towards EU over Beef Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 12 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Malcolm
Rifkind declared today that retaliation against the European Union
could not be ruled out unless its worldwide ban on British beef
exports was lifted.
</P>
<P>
In a TV interview, Rifkind said that his government would "do
whatever is within our power" to solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
The foreign secretary expressed his dissatisfaction with the
EU' delaying tactics, saying that British people did not just
want symbolic gestures and that they wanted a strategy that would
produce results.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister John Major also warned EU member states
Saturday that they should not underestimate British anger over the
beef ban when they considered a partial lifting of the ban.
</P>
<P>
He told the Scottish Tory conference in Aberdeen:"Our European
partners must understand the level of resentment that will be
created if they fly in the face of the scientific arguments and in
the face of the commission's recommendation, and continue to
damage the British beef industry."
</P>
<P>
The British government feared that Germany could block the
European Commission's recommendation for a partial lifting of the
ban on beef derivatives such as gelatine and tallow.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the EU vets would discuss the the
above-said recommendation on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Search for Victims of DC-9 Jet Suspended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Having found no sign of
survivors or any bodies of the 109 people on board the DC-9
aircraft which crashed into the Florida Everglades' swamp
Saturday, the search for victims was suspended Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Luis Fernandez of the Metro-Dade Fire Rescue agency said
workers stopped their search when they found that it was apparent
that no one could have survived the swampy crash site because of
the difficult conditions.
</P>
<P>
"There's no place to hide for the victims," Fernandez said.
"There's so much water and so much muck out there, we really don't
know what is left of the plane."
</P>
<P>
The Atlanta-bound ValuJet Flight 592 ploughed into the swamp
soon after taking off from Miami International Airport on Saturday
afternoon. On board the plane were 104 passengers and five crew
members.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Aviation Administration officials said that shortly
after takeoff, the pilot reported to the air traffic control tower
that there was smoke in the cockpit. A few minutes later, the
aircraft disappeared from the tower's radar.
</P>
<P>
Rescuers with airboats battled throughout the night waist-deep
water, thick muck, snakes, razor-sharp sawgrass and an oily sheen
from the jet's fuel. They had to assign some people to watch for
wildlife and chase off alligators.
</P>
<P>
The Everglades cover more than 2,000 square miles (5,180 square
kilometers) of South Florida. It is a wetlands home to alligators,
rare birds, the endangered Florida panther and manatees.
</P>
<P>
Divers searched the murky waters again on Sunday, hoping to
find the jet's flight data and voice recorders to provide clues to
the crash and workers planned to draw off the water and build a
road to the site.

<HEADLINE> 5 Israeli Soldiers Wounded in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Five Israeli soldiers were
wounded today in two Hezbollah attacks in the Israeli
self-declared security zone in south Lebanon, Israel Television
reported.
</P>
<P>
The incidents occurred in the northeast sector of the
"security zone" when an anti-tank rocket hit one of the vehicles
of an Israeli army mobile patrol, while mortar bombs were fired at
an Israel army outpost nearby.
</P>
<P>
An army major riding with the patrol was badly hurt by the
rocket, and four other soldiers, including two junior officers,
were lightly wounded.
</P>
<P>
Both the Israeli army and the South Lebanon Army (SLA)
responded to the attacks with heavy shelling at Hezbollah
positions beyond the "security zone" as the wounded soldiers were
evacuated by helicopters to the Rambam Hospital in Haifa.
</P>
<P>
Later Israeli planes also carried out attacks against
Hezbollah targets opposite the east sector of the "security zone."
</P>
<P>
Today's incident came after one SLA soldier was killed and two
others were injured when roadside bombs exploded in two separate
attacks by Hezbollah militants in the "security zone" last time.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that there had been Israeli
casualties caused by Hezbollah attacks in the "security zone"
since the end of the Operation Grapes of Wrath two weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear yet that from where Hezbollah fired the
anti-tank rocket today, or if there were any Hezbollah
casualties from the Israeli and the SLA response.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, France, member of the monitoring
committee which also includes the U.S., Israel, Syria and Lebanon
to observe the cease-fire arrangement, is urging Israel and
Hezbollah to show at most restraints following today's incident in
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
A French Foreign Ministry statement issued in Paris, capital
of France, said that both sides should ensure that civilians
should not be indirect victims of military operations.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia Warns of Penalty on Pilgrims for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Interior Ministry has
announced that it will impose penalties on pilgrims who intend to
stay on in the kingdom following the recent Haj at the two holy
mosques in the country.
</P>
<P>
"Anyone who stays on will be liable for detention, penalty and
deportation," the ministry said in a statement which was carried
today by the Saudi Press Agency.
</P>
<P>
"Any citizen or resident who gives shelter to those who stay on
will also be liable for penalty," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
About 1.6 million pilgrims, mainly foreign nationals, went to
the Islamic kingdom to perform Haj during the nine-day pilgrimage
season this year, compared with 2 million people of last year. The
Haj ended last week.
</P>
<P>
Since the Haj is over now, the statement added, those who have
come to the kingdom as pilgrims or as visitors should leave the
kingdom and return to their homelands.
</P>
<P>
The over-staying of the pilgrims or visitors is tantamount to
violation of the kingdom's regulations and instructions. As such,
over-stayers will be subject to detention, penalty and
deportation, it noted.
</P>
<P>
Any one, either Saudi or non-Saudi is also warned against
sheltering or employing any pilgrim who overstays by any
means. The violators of this warning will be severely punished
and could be meted out with imprisonment and fines, the statement
said.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Opposition Party Urged to Return to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government today urged
the opposition United National Independence Party (UNIP) to go
back to parliament to participate in the on-going debates on the
constitutional amendment bill (the draft constitution).
</P>
<P>
Speaking on Zambia television live program, Legal Affairs
Minister Remmy Mushota said the government was prepared to
consider proposals from the UNIP if its MPs returned to the
house.
</P>
<P>
He also accused the media of deliberatly concentrating on the
presidential clause of the draft constitution and omitting MPs'
contributions on other clauses.
</P>
<P>
The UNIP MPs walked out of the parliament three times since
the draft constitution was tabled at the National Assembly for
debating on May 7.
</P>
<P>
The opposition party has differed from the ruling party of the
country and the government over several clauses of the draft
constitution, particularly over the clause of presidential
qualification which stiputates that only a second generation
Zambian is qualified for standing as presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
The UNIP has claimed that the constitutional clause, once
adopted, will prevent its leader and former president Kenneth
Kaunda from contesting the presidency in the coming general
elections, because Kaunda's parents are Malawians.
</P>
<P>
However, the ruling party and the government have insisted
that the clause has expressed the will of the majority Zambians
who have demanded that the nation should be ruled by an
indigenous Zambian.

<HEADLINE> Liberian Refugees Stranded at Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Liberian refugees were
today stranded at sea in a rusty fright near the coast of Ghana
because of Accra's refusal to accept them.
</P>
<P>
The Ghanian government sent two naval boats to block the
freight from entering its ports, saying it would only accept
non-Liberian refugees, according to a radio report monitored here
today.
</P>
<P>
"Only Ghanians, United Nations officials, aid workers and
foreign nationals seeking transit through Ghana will be allowed
to disembark," Chrysantus Ache, the U.N. Refugee Agency's
representative in Accra, was quoted by the radio as saying.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to the Ghana News Agency, the refugees
are likely to end up where they started -- in the violent streets
of Monrovia, capital of Liberia.
</P>
<P>
Medicins Sans Frontieres, an international charity body
tracking the distressed vessel from a chartered ship, said it
would ask Ghanian authorities to allow a doctor to board the bulk
challenge to treat cases of diarrhoea among the 4,000 passengers.
</P>
<P>
Many thousands of Liberians, preferring the risks at sea to
the violence of a festering six-year civil war, have crowded
around Monrovia's port in hopes of getting onto any departing
boats.
</P>
<P>
Aid workers said an estimated 20,000 Liberians could now be in
boats in choppy West African waters and they were working out
plans to monitor the coast for those in distress.
</P>
<P>
Monrovia port was closed on Saturday after food riots broke
out there. Troops of the West African Peacekeepers, ECOMOG, shot
dead two people trying to steal aid food on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Ghanian Foreign Minister Obed Asamoah said the bulk
challenge, which was forced back to the sea by the naval boats of
Cote d'Ivoire on Thursday after emergency repairs, would have to
wait offshore while its passengers were screened.
</P>
<P>
Fighting resumed in Monrovia following the collapse of the
Accra summit peace talks of West African heads of state and
government to end the six years of civil war.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus President Expects No Peace Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides
said today that he did not expect a peace plan from anyone at
present for a solution to the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
He was commenting on a statement made by Turkish Cypriot leader
Rauf Denktash that Britain was preparing a plan for the Cyprus
settlement.
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe there is a British plan or any other plan from
the European Union or from the United States at this stage," the
president said.
</P>
<P>
Denktash had stated that although a high-ranking British
official did not bring any plan with him during his one-day trip
to Cyprus Friday, the Britons were drafting such a plan.
</P>
<P>
President Clerides said foreign visitors were still trying to
know for sure the positions of the parties involved in the Cyprus
problem. "They have not yet made up their minds for a plan," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Clerides said that the foreign mediators would not submit any
plan at present because such a move would lead to a deadlock.
</P>
<P>
On the thorny issue of the island's security, Clerides said
that his demilitarization proposal was gaining ground.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the proposal provides for the disbanding of
the Republic's armed forces, the National Guard, and the
simultaneous withdrawal of the Turkish forces from the island.
</P>
<P>
"We would welcome an international force in Cyprus to have
under its responsibility, a U.N. Security Council mandate, to
defend the independence and territorial integrity of the Federal
Republic of Cyprus," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added this international force would have the right to
intervene if one of the two communities in the island was under
threat.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriot north and the
Greek Cypriot south since Turkish troops invaded the island in
1974 following a Greek Cypriot coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. and international community are still trying to seek a
solution to the Cyprus problem, which has remained unsolved.

<HEADLINE> IRA Open to Persuasion: Sinn Fein </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 12 (Xinhua) -- A leading member of Sinn Fein said
today that the Irish Republican Army (IRA) was "open to
persuasion" on restoring its cease-fire shattered on February 9
with a huge blast in east London.
</P>
<P>
Martin McGuinness, Sinn Fein's chief negotiator with the
British government, said in a TV interview that he himself wanted
a ceasefire as desperately as anybody.
</P>
<P>
But he reiterated Sinn Fein's position that ceasefire could be
best achieved if British Prime Minister John Major issued
"unambiguous statement", offering assurance that the all-party
talks process on the future of Northern Ireland to be convened on
June 10 was real and meaningful.
</P>
<P>
McGuinness vowed that his party would turn up for the talks
process even if it was then banned.
</P>
<P>
According to a report in the Observer weekly, security chiefs
in Dublin, London and Belfast believe that the IRA leadership is
moving towards a ceasefire before the start of all-party talks on
June 10.
</P>
<P>
One security source was quoted as saying that the next few
weeks were going to be a period of intense political activity and
the IRA was believed to want to be part of it.
</P>
<P>
"The IRA knows it cannot participate if it does not call a
ceasefire, and if it does not call a ceasefire, it has nothing
potentially to gain," he analyzed.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Chief Applauds Tripartite Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General Esmat
Abdul-Meguid applauded the tripartite summit held today in Cairo,
describing it as live evidence of effective joint Arab action, the
capability of consolidating the unity of Arab ranks in face of
challenges.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to reporters, Abdul-Meguid warmly welcomed the
tripartite summit as a standing fact that the convocation of
limited Arab summits from time to time is active contribution to
efforts which will ultimately lead to the convening of an expanded
Arab summit once Arab conditions permit greater Arab
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, King Hussein of Jordan and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat met today in Cairo to coordinate
their positions on Arab-Israeli negotiations, particularly on
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The three leaders agreed on the establishment of a mechanism at
the ministerial level for coordination and cooperation among
concerned Arab parties.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein expressed support to the Palestinians' claim to
Jerusalem as the capital of their future state, but adding that
the holy sites in Jerusalem should be shared by Jews, Christians
and Moslems.
</P>
<P>
The three leaders will meet again early next month in Jordan to
continue their coordination talks.
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Meguid said the conclusions reached by the tripartite
represent a big credit in favor of joint Arab action. They also
constitute an impetus to the League of Arab States to intensify
its efforts to forge unified Arab stances, to strengthen
inter-Arab cooperation in all fields, and to ensure the full and
legitimate Arab rights in the current peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
He asserted that the Arab League would pursue sincere efforts
to achieve the ultimate objective of national Arab
reconciliation.

FREETOWN, May 12 (Xinhua)--- A Nigerian vessel, ''Victoria
Reefer'' with over 1,000 people on board fleeing the strife in
Liberia is still anchored in Sierra Leone's territorial waters

</P>
<P>
It was however refused landing by Sierra Leonean authorities

<HEADLINE> Heads of State Arrive in Iran to Inaugurate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MASHHAD, IRAN, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Eleven heads of state
arrived here today to join the Iranian president for Monday's
inauguration of a trans-Asian railway which links landlocked
Central Asian republics with the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
The inauguration ceremony will be the grandest in Iran in the
past decade, especially since Iranian President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani came to power seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani called the trans-Asian railway "a major development
in the history of the region."
</P>
<P>
"Iran and Turkmenistan have done a great job in reviving the
Silk Road which for centuries had served as a link between the
East and the West," he said.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the event has much more political
significance than economic one. Iran regards the railway as a
success in its struggle against the U.S. attempt to isolate Iran,
they said.
</P>
<P>
The 11 foreign presidents to inaugurate the railway are from
Afghanistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan,
Kyrghyzstan, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkey, Turkmenistan and
Uzbekistan.
</P>
<P>
High-ranking government officials from such countries as
Russia, China, Ukraine, Syria, Cuba, the Philippines and Malaysia
will also attend the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Mahmoud Vaezi told Xinhua that
"12 presidents, two vice-presidents, several deputy prime
ministers and a lot of ministers, altogether 56 delegations, will
participate in the inauguration ceremony."
</P>
<P>
"Iran is a big country and it can not be isolated," he
said. "Iran is a country that has influences in the region."
</P>
<P>
"You can see right now. If Iran is isolated, there will not be
so many delegations for this ceremony," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that the U.S. sanction against Iran does not affect his
country politically, nor does it economically.
</P>
<P>
"The sanction is not something new. You can go back to 17 years
ago. We decided to cut political and economic relations with the
United States. We are ready to live without the United States," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Mashhad-Sarakhs-Tajan railway is 295 kilometers long,
including 165 kilometers in the Iranian territory and 130
kilometers on the soil of Turkmenistan.
</P>
<P>
The railway, which links Sarakhs to Tajan in Turkmenistan and
on to China, will allow the Central Asian countries and even China
to have further access to the Persian Gulf through Iran and to the
Mediterranean through Turkey.
</P>
<P>
In Iran, the railway is connected with the Bafgh-Bandar Abbas
railway, adding up to a total distance of 2,620 kilometers from
the Iranian-Turkmenistan border to the coast of the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Vaezi stated that the railway will bring the countries in the
region closer politically, culturally and economically.
</P>
<P>
"This railroad will make all countries in this region work
together more closely. It will make landlocked CIS (Commonwealth
of Independent States) countries have access to the Persian Gulf
easily for import and export. Iran is ready to be a bridge for
them," he said.
</P>
<P>
The deputy minister said that the railway now handles 20
million tons of cargo a year, "but we are ready to increase it."

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's ANC Secretary-general To Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 12 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's outgoing
Constitutional Assembly Chairman Cyril Ramaphosa will resign as
African National Congress (ANC) secretary-general once the new
constitution is certified by the Constitutional Court.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Cape Town, the ANC said the decision
was made at its two-day National Executive Committee (NEC)
meeting at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Ramapnosa announced last month that he would quit the
parliament and take up a position as senior executive in the
private sector once the new constitution is completed.
</P>
<P>
The ANC has discussed the background and reasons for
Ramaphosa's move to the private, said the source.
</P>
<P>
ANC spokesman Ronnie Mamoepa said the NEC's weekend meeting
received a report that Ramaphosa's new post in the private sector
would make it impossible for him to serve as ANC
secretary-general on a full-time basis.
</P>
<P>
However, Mamoepa confirmed that Ramaphosa would remain a
member of the ANC and the NEC.
</P>
<P>
The statement said Ramaphosa, who was chosen in 1994 by the
ANC to spearhead constitutional negotiations, had effectively
been the symbolic secretary-general of the party because he had
left most of the day-to-day work to his deputy, Cheryl Carolus.
</P>
<P>
It was understood that Carolus would continue as acting
secretary-general until her appointment at next year's national
convention meeting.

inter-Tajik conflict, " the Press Service pointed out.
</P>
<P>

rocket launchers, anti-aircraft guns, mortars, recoilless guns and
fire-arms during the attack, the reports said, adding that they
repeated their "provocative attacks" during the night of May 8-9.

<HEADLINE> Child Abuse or Neglect Reports on Rise in New York </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 13 (Xinhua) -- New York City's child welfare
agency has been deluged in recent months by new reports of abuse
or neglect, which have increased 25 percent since last Autumn.
</P>
<P>
Last month alone, there were nearly 5,000 reports of abuse or
neglect made in the city, a rate that shows no sign of
diminishing, and that by year's end, could substantially surpass
the total of roughly 47,000 reports filed in 1995, according to
mass circulated newspaper New York Times.
</P>
<P>
The agency's workers, fearing child abuse or neglect may be
exposed by newspapers, have been removing children from troubled
families. According to agency officials, there have been 1,900
emergency removals in the first four months of 1996. There were
only 3,500 such removals in all of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Last month, officials who care for children taken from
dangerous households during the night or on weekends, handled
1,041 emergency removals, and the figures for this months are
already projected to rise 50 percent more.
</P>
<P>
On any given day, a handful or more children are forced to
sleep overnight inside makeshift shelter with cribs and beds
offered by the workers.
</P>
<P>
Officials with the child welfare agency attributed the rising
number of complaints mainly to the publicity generated by the
death last November of Elisa Izquierdo, the 6-year-old girl who
was beaten to death by her mother.

<HEADLINE> Manila Tries to Woo GM Project in Full </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is bent on
getting a proposed 1 billion US dollar automotive manufacturing
project of the US car giant General Motors (GM) in full.
</P>
<P>
Trade and Industry Secretary Rizalino Navarro said today, "We
are working to get the GM project to be located here in full, as
we can be sure that Thailand is also trying to host the project
entirely."
</P>
<P>
He noted that the GM project is eligible under a
complementation scheme through the ASEAN industrial cooperation
(AICO) concept.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that the GM has not applied as one and that
this alternative has neither been raised nor discussed with the
GM.
</P>
<P>
But this is an option open to the GM, he said adding "It may
avail of such an option only if it decides to."
</P>
<P>
Should the GM opt for an AICO scheme, it may choose to locate
the parts manufacturing in any of the ASEAN (Association of
Southeast Asian Nations) countries including project competitors
Thailand and the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of a GM car manufacturing plant either in the
Philippines or Thailand will transform the host country into a GM
production base for car exports to the APEC (Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation) region.
</P>
<P>
The GM plans to produce 100,000 to 120,000 units of cars
annually, of which 80 percent are geared for exports.

<P>
MANILA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) will start a investment-promotion drive in the
united states next month to lure us car companies.
</P>
<P>
Trade and Industry Secretary Rizalino Navarro said today that
the drive will be under the attractive package offered by the
ASEAN Industrial Cooperation (AICO) concept.
</P>
<P>
Under the AICO scheme, investment project will enjoy an
immediate preferential tariff of zero to five percent.
</P>
<P>
In addition, faster action for AICO project applicants is also
assured since approvals are done by respective board of
investments or ministry of industries of the ASEAN-member
countries and no longer by the senior economic officials' meeting.
</P>
<P>
The AICO scheme was signed by the ASEAN economic ministers last

<HEADLINE> Japanese City Opens Official Exam to Foreigners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Kawasaki today became the first major
Japanese city to allow foreign nationals to sit an exam to select
municipal officials.
</P>
<P>
The Kawasaki municipal government decided to scrap the
nationality requirement despite opposition from the Home Affairs
Ministry which prefers all public servants should be Japanese
nationals, especially those holding administrative positions.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government has argued that only 182 of its 3,500
employees hold administrative positions.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government's personnel department will start
distributing application forms later this month and hold the exam
on June 30, local press reports said.
</P>
<P>
The scrapping of the nationality requirement, however, is
conditional on a municipal stipulation that foreign nationals will
not be promoted to posts higher than section chief.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Home Affairs Ministry have reportedly
expressed concern about the stipulation, arguing that it
constitutes discrimination against foreigners.

<P>
HANOI, May 13 (Xinhua)-- Vietnam plans to standardize laws
governing its Industrial Zones (IZ) and Export Processing Zones
(EPZ), said Vice Minister of Planning and Investment Nguyen Nhac.
</P>
<P>
The latest issue of Vietnam Investment Review quoted Nhac as
saying that draft laws will be submitted to the cabinet later this
month after soliciting opinions from the ministries and sectors
concerned.
</P>
<P>
In recent surveys, a major complaint is that enterprises within
the IZs are not differentiated from those outside the zones other
than in terms of taxes on their profits.
</P>
<P>
Another complaint is that domestic enterprises do not have the
same tax breaks and exemptions as foreign-invested ones enjoy in
the zones.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's six EPZs and 9 IZs will be grouped in a single
category under the new laws, said the vice minister.

<HEADLINE> Bribery Case in Greek OTE to Be Investigated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Greek Justice Minister Evangelos
Venizelos today asked the Supreme Court prosecutor to instigate an
inquiry into alleged major bribery-taking case in the state-owned
Hellenic Telecommunications Organization (OTE).
</P>
<P>
In an "extremely urgent" letter to prosecutor Athanassios
Sioulas, Venizelos said Greece's public life can not tolerate
shadows" and urged a full and speedy clarification of the matter.
</P>
<P>
According to the influential local daily Kathimerini (Daily
News) on Sunday, senior officials of OTE had received large amount
of kickbacks in awarding of the country's digital phone line
contracts to German Intracom and Siemens through tendering.
</P>
<P>
It wrote that at least 8 bank accounts in Western banks were
"fed" by a central account in Handels bank Berlin belonging to
the president and vice-president of Intracom and an east-German
citizen. It alleged that sums amounting to more than 6 million
U.S. dollars had been channeled from the central account in Berlin
to at least 8 other accounts in Western banks between 1987 and
1991.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said that the names of high-ranking OTE officials
and consultants, who formulated the technological and economic
terms of the tendering, were "involved" in those accounts.
</P>
<P>
The state audit council earlier this month ruled that the
awarding of an OTE contract for the provision of one million
digital telephones to the Siemens-Intracom consortium in 1994
was illegal due to irregularities in the tendring procedure and
insufficient consideration given to pricing and rival bids. It
said the irregularities were such as to render the contract null.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, MAY 13 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Ambassador to Pakistan
Muhammad Noman Galal has advised Pakistani businessmen to have a
joint holding company with their Egyptian counterparts to promote
bilateral trade.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting today in Karachi with Haji Shafiqur Rehman,
President of the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Noman
Galal said the governments of the two countries had agreed in last
December to have a joint holding company in private sector for
increasing bilateral trade.
</P>
<P>
He asked the Pakistani businessmen to develop contacts with
their counterparts for two-way trade.
</P>
<P>
However, due to lack of communication, the businessmen of the
two countries are unaware of the potential of business
opportunities available in each other's country.
</P>
<P>
Galal said bilateral trade between the two countries is not
encouraged because of the lack of complementarities of products.
Pakistan exports cotton and textiles in large quantities, while
Egypt is also a major exporter of the same products.
</P>
<P>
He suggested to encourage bilateral trade in other sectors,
including tourism.
</P>
<P>
Shafiqur Rehman said during the meeting that both Pakistan and
Egypt have many common areas of interest, and can benefit from
each other's expertise in various fields.

<HEADLINE> Mayor Helps Mother Cure Drug Addict Son </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIHAI, May 13 (Xinhua) -- A desperate plea from the mother of
a drug addict in this coastal city in southwest China's Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region spurred the mayor to launch an anti-drug
campaign.
</P>
<P>
In February this year Yang Jichang, Party secretary and mayor
of Beihai and deputy Party secretary of Guangxi, received a letter
from an old woman asking for urgent help for her youngest son, a
drug addict.
</P>
<P>
The 76-year-old retiree said in the letter that since her
husband died 30 years ago she had undergone all sorts of hardships
to bring up all her five children and help them to find jobs in
local factories.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, however, her youngest son met a group of drug addicts
and soon joined them. She spent a lot of money sending him to
rehabilitation centers three times, but all her efforts ended in
vain.
</P>
<P>
She sent a letter to the mayor begging for help. Greatly
shocked, the mayor immediately convened a joint meeting of the
heads of political, public security, and judicial departments,
which decided to launch a major campaign against drugs, including
propaganda against drug abuse and a crackdown on drug traffickers
and addicts.
</P>
<P>
Upon the request of the mayor, the "Beihai Daily" published the
mother's letter on its front page, along with a special commentary
and editorial articles.
</P>
<P>
People sent a large number of letters to the newspaper, voicing
their compassion for the mother and expressing the hope that the
government would carry out its anti-drug efforts to a successful
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
The mayor also ordered the local public security bureau to pay
a visit to the old woman's home, and to spare no efforts to help
her son to quit drugs.
</P>
<P>
With the mother's consent, the public security bureau of Beihai
took the young man away for medical treatment.

<HEADLINE> Draft Explanation of Nationality Law Implementation in HK SAR Discussed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese legislators today praised a
draft explanation on the implementation of China's Nationality Law
in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region after 1997 as
"flexible and pragmatic while sticking to principles", and
suggested it be passed as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The draft explanation of several questions related to the
implementation of the Nationality Law of the People's Republic of
China in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) was
submitted for consideration a week ago to the current session of
the Standing Committee of the Eighth National People's Congress
(NPC), China's top legislature, here.
</P>
<P>
"The draft explanation will surely help reassure Hong Kong
residents and benefit Hong Kong's return to the motherland on July
1, 1997," legislator Qiu Qing pointed out, adding that the
explanation reflects China's full sovereignty and the dignity of
the Nationality Law.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Zhou Jue said the draft explanation is not only in
accordance with the Nationality Law and the Basic Law of the Hong
Kong SAR, but also consistent with relevant stipulations in
international laws.
</P>
<P>
According to him, it is common by international laws to judge a
person's nationality by his descent and birthplace. Since most
Hong Kong residents have Chinese descent and were born on Chinese
soil, he said, they shall certainly have Chinese citizenship.
</P>
<P>
The draft explanation stipulates that those Hong Kong residents
who obtained British passports through the so-called "British
Nationality Selection Scheme" will not be recognized as British
citizens, and the British passports possessed by Hong Kong
residents can be used as valid travel documents in their travels
to other countries and regions. Such stipulations, Zhou said, not
only reflect China's stand, but also take Hong Kong people's
interests into full consideration.
</P>
<P>
"It is beyond question that the stipulations will win support
of the Hong Kong compatriots," he concluded.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Xu Qichao suggested that work on issuing Hong Kong
SAR passports be speeded up to avoid possible problems.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Residents Spend an Average of 75 Yuan Each on Cosmetics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Residents in this largest
metropolis of China each year spend an average 75 yuan (about nine
US dollars) on cosmetics.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey conducted over two years by the State
Information Center and the Shanghai Commercial Information Center,
cosmetics have become one of the city's fastest-growing
industries, with a 85 percent increase in the retail sector last
year.
</P>
<P>
The statistics showed that among the 75 yuan spent on
cosmetics, 50 yuan goes on purchasing facial beauty products while
the remaining 25 yuan goes on hair washing materials.
</P>
<P>
The mainstream of the consumers is young people and middle-aged
women, of whom people aged between 14 and 44 constitute half of
the total.
</P>
<P>
And people in urban districts consume more cosmetics than those
living on the outskirts.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are more than 2,000 brands of cosmetics
selling in the local market. Imported cosmetics and products of
joint ventures account for half of the market share.
</P>
<P>
In China more and more people are starting to pay attention to
their appearance in tandem with the improvement in living
standards.

<HEADLINE> State Control on Medicines to Be Tightened </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government will tighten
the control on the production and marketing of medicines in a bid
to ensure that pharmaceuticals are safe and efficient.
</P>
<P>
Governments at all levels and relevant departments should
closely observe the national laws and administrative regulations,
and should not be led astray by localism, according to a recent
circular issued by the State Council.
</P>
<P>
The circular pointed out that the management of medicine should
be strengthened in order to stamp out illegal production and
marketing.
</P>
<P>
The government will specially check sales commissions in the
pharmaceuticals market, which has led to losses of state revenue,
unfair competition and other problems, the circular said.
</P>
<P>
It also called on the units supplying basic medicines to
guarantee the quality of medicines and strengthen the
administration of medicine manufacturers and private medicine
traders.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Factions Agree Boundary Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The Muslim-Croat federation and
the Serb republic, Bosnia's two sub-entities, have agreed on 40
adjustments to the boundary separating them, it was announced
today.
</P>
<P>
A statement by the NATO-led Implementation Force (IFOR) said
that the adjustments relate to the 1,095-kilometer inter-entity
boundary line (IEBL) which was drawn up under the Dayton peace
accords.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, reached at the IEBL subcommission which
comprises representatives from the two entities and IFOR
officials, will have to be ratified by the two governments as well
as IFOR Commander Leighton Smith.
</P>
<P>
Disputes remain, however, over a section of Dobrinja on the
outskirts of Sarajevo despite more than 30 rounds of negotiations
and on-site visits, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
During the past few weeks, rising tension and outbreaks of
violence have been reported in Dobrinja, where the Dayton-agreed
boundary line would split buildings and even apartments.
</P>
<P>
Michael Willcocks, chairman of the IEBL subcommission, said
that "all parties should dedicate themselves now to finding a
workable compromise for Dobrinja so that the differences that lie
at the base of the dispute won't produce further attempts to
decide them through acts of violence and intimidation".
</P>
<P>
If no agreement is reached on Dobrinja soon, the issue will be
referred to Smith and Carl Bildt, High Representative of the
international community, who will then decide whether it should be
handled at a higher level, Willcocks added.

<HEADLINE> Bell Labs to Open Branch in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Bell Laboratories, one of the
world's largest technical development arm, will launch a branch in
China, said Randy Yeh, president of Lucent Technologies China,
formerly AT&AMP;T's network and systems business.
</P>
<P>
Yeh recently told the Beijing press that the work of appraisal
and construction will start within this year.
</P>
<P>
Known as a cradle for hundreds of technical breakthroughs in
telecommunications, Bell Labs, formerly a research and development
base of AT&AMP;T, has obtained more than 25,000 patents since it was
founded in 1925.
</P>
<P>
Yeh said that Lucent has set up six representative offices and
seven joint ventures across China, and realized a tenfold increase
in its business over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the company's focus will be on China's radio
telecom market in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
Being a relative newcomer to a market heavily dominated by
Motorola, Ericsson and Northern Telecom, Lucent is eager to throw
down the gauntlet with its outstanding research and development
power, Yeh said, adding that Lucent is confident about the growth
of China's information industry, and is willing to transfer more
hi-tech achievements to the country. The establishment of the Bell
Labs branch in China is now under careful consideration, and the
details of this project will be discussed by the company and its
Chinese partners in "a prudent manner."

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Bangkok Bank of Commerce in Trouble </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Clients of the Bangkok Bank of
Commerce (BBC) knew that something was wrong with the Bank and
last week there were runs on the bank.
</P>
<P>
However, the Governor of the central bank, Vijit Supinit, stood
firm that the BBC was not in deep trouble.
</P>
<P>
Yet, the Opposition Democrat Party has revealed a 400-page
report on BBC's poor financial position.
</P>
<P>
Who is to be believed?
</P>
<P>
Some time ago, the Bank of Thailand, the central bank, released
a supervisory report, which disclosed not only the actual
financial performance of the BBC, but also the BBC's methods for
covering up fraudulent activities.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992, the central bank has been closely monitoring the
BBC, and has since uncovered evidence of fraud at the BBC.
</P>
<P>
An auditor's report revealed that the BBC suffered losses for
four consecutive years from 1992-1995, with 380 million baht (15.2
million U.S. dollars) in 1994 and 1.08 billion baht (43.2 million
dollars) in 1995, but the BBC reported profits before tax of 1.14
billion baht (45.6 million dollars) in 1994 and 1.64 billion baht
(65.6 million dollars) in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The auditor's report further revealed that at the end of 1995,
the BBC's bad assets had climbed to 78 billion baht (3.12 billion
dollars), or 47 percent of the BBC's net assets and the ratio
continues to rise.
</P>
<P>
Low-quality debts, identified as bad debts, doubtful debts and
sub-standard debts, were 41 billion baht (1.64 billion dollars) in
1994 and 45 billion baht (1.8 billion dollars) in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The reluctance of central bank Governor Vijit Supinit to reveal
the truth about the ailing BBC or take legal action against the
bank's management has raised questions about his role as the
country's chief financial regulator.
</P>
<P>
During the no-confidence debate last week, it was revealed that
some politicians, including Deputy Interior Minister Suchart
Tamcharoen, obtained loans from the bank in shady deals to buy
land, and then used the land bought as collateral to get further
loans to take over ailing listed companies. In the course, the
politicians made a lot of money while many others suffered
tremendous loss in the stock exchange market.
</P>
<P>
The scandal at the Bangkok Bank of Commerce represents the
biggest financial losses in the history of a Thai financial
institution.
</P>
<P>
Observers say that it may take the bank at least 10 years to
deal with its staggering 78 billion baht non-performing assets
before it can even hope of returning to financial health.
</P>
<P>
It appears that Vijit lied. Despite overwhelming evidence,
Vijit insisted the BBC's trouble were under control after the
central bank injected 5 billion baht (200 million dollars) into
the bank.
</P>
<P>
After manipulating information about the BBC's financial
position, Vijit lacks the credibility to remain on as the chief
regulator of commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
Even though Vijit will remain on his post, he will be
remembered as a governor who manipulated the truth, tarnishing the
image of the institution he represented.

BEIJING, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The retail price in China dropped
by 0.3 percentage points in April, compared with that of March,
but a rise by 7.4 percent over the same 1995 period.
</P>
<P>
According to the State Planning Commission and State Statistics
Bureau today, the small price hikes in retail sector are mainly
due to the price rises of fresh vegetables.

The country's provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities
have been urged to do a better job in grain and vegetable supplies
and to control their price increases.
</P>
<P>
The island province of Hainan had the country's lowest price
hike rate of 3.9 percent in April, and the northwest province of
Shaanxi the highest, at 10.2 percent, compared to the nation's
average of 7.4 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The State Education Commission
(SEC) announced today that 660 institutions of higher learning
nationwide are expected to charge students for college education
this year.
</P>
<P>
Among them 247 colleges and universities had introduced the
pay-to-learn scheme by the end of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The SEC stipulates that students in teachers', agricultural,
forestry, nautical, ethnic-minority and physical culture colleges
and universities will not be charged tuition fees.
</P>
<P>
The official sources said that all the higher-learning
institutions in 10 provinces, municipalities and autonomous
regions have completed the reform, including Beijing, Tianjin,
Shanghai, and the Guangxi Zhuang and Tibet autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
College education has traditionally been paid for by the
government, which assigned jobs to college graduates. In 1994
China decided to charge students part of their college education
costs. College students, in turn, would get a greater say in
choosing jobs.
</P>
<P>
According to 1995 statistics, China now has a total of
1,054 colleges and universities, most of which are expected to
complete the reform by the end of next year.

<P>
In addition to local new power-supply sites, the province is
also putting more effort into building electricity grids, and
improving power transmission and transformation equipment within
the province and between it and neighboring provinces.
</P>
<P>
During the 1996-2000 period it is to build 500-kv truck
networks to cover the province.

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Respond to Iraqi Protest over Turkey's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Turkey will respond to the Iraqi
protest over the cross-border operations of the Turkish armed
forces into northern Iraq last week, a Turkish Foreign Ministry
deputy spokesman said here today.
</P>
<P>
Deputy spokesman Nurettin Nurkan said at a weekly press
conference that Turkey is determined to fight against terrorist
groups and secure its borders, adding that Turkey does not
tolerate the terrorist activities of the Kurdish Workers' Party
(PKK) in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that it is quite normal that Turkey holds
struggle against the PKK members by staging necessary military
operations in the area.
</P>
<P>
Turkey will stage the same military operations in a bid to wipe
out the PKK rebels in the future, said Nurkan.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Sadi Calislar, Turkey's charge d'affaires in
Baghdad, was summoned to the Iraqi Foreign Ministry to be given a
memorandum in which Iraq urged Turkish troops to withdraw from
Iraqi territory.
</P>
<P>
The official Iraqi news agency (INA) reported that Iraq
demanded the immediate withdrawal of the Turkish soldiers from
its Kurdish north and described the Turkish military operation in
northern Iraq as "a flagrant violation" of its territorial
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
The agency said the Turkish operation represented "a severe
violation of international law, the U.N. convention and good
neighborly relations."
</P>
<P>
About 1,200 Turkish government troops, backed by US-made
Cobra helicopter gunships, had penetrated up to 10 kilometers
inside Iraqi territory, killing 15 PKK rebels.
</P>
<P>
However, Turkish officials said that the Turkish armed forces
in northern Iraq returned on May 9.

ANKARA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Minister Emre
Gonensay and Defense Minister Oltan Sungurlu will pay separate
visits to the United States this month, Turkish Foreign Ministry
Deputy Spokesman Nurettin Nurkan said here today.
</P>

The two ministers will discuss with U.S. officials proposals to

</P>
<P>
The Turkish Daily News today quoted Sungurlu as saying that
Turkey would offer to patrol the skies of northern Iraq with its
own planes instead of the fighters of the multinational force,
provided that the United states, France and Britain agree to
finance the operation.
</P>
<P>
He said that the command structure of Provide Comfort would be
remodeled to allow Turkish commanders to take full control both
in Turkey and in northern Iraq.
</P>

He added that he would convey these proposals to U.S. Secretary
of Defense William Perry when they meet at the Pentagon.

<HEADLINE> China Swings into Action to Defend Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 13 (Xinhua) -- A nationwide campaign to implement
the Development Program on Chinese Women, scheduled to last for
one month, started here today.
</P>
<P>
The promotion activity, organized by the Women and Children's
Work Committee of the State Council, is a specific response by the
Chinese government to the Fourth World Conference on Women and
international conventions connected with it.
</P>
<P>
Delegates to the conference, which was held here in September
1995, strongly called for action to realize the goals of women's
development set out by the conference and the Nairobi
Forward-Looking Strategies for the Advancement of Women to the
Year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Chen Muhua, chairperson of the All-China Women's Federation,
told a conference here today that leaders at all levels and all
walks of life of society should be aware of the 11 major goals set
out in the Development Program.
</P>
<P>
These goals include having more women involved in state and
social decision-making and management, protecting women's legal
labor rights, and smashing crimes such as abducting women and
prostitution.
</P>
<P>
The Program also stressed that more attention and aid should be
given to women living in remote and poor areas, and with ethnic
minority backgrounds. All women living in poverty should be able
to have enough food and clothing by the end of this century.
</P>
<P>
According to the Program, a data bank on the situation of women
in China will be set up and a better social environment be created
for women's development.
</P>
<P>
Chen, also vice-chairperson of the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress, said that the 11 goals accord with the
12 fields of development specified in the Platform of Action
passed by the World Conference on Women.
</P>
<P>
"The realization of these goals is a realistic step for
implementing the Nairobi Forward-Looking Strategies for the
Advancement of Women to the Year 2000," she added.
</P>
<P>
The Program was issued by the Chinese government in July
1995. Already, one third of China's 31 provinces, autonomous
regions and municipalities have worked out local development plans
for women, with the rest to follow by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Chen asked local governments to help solve problems faced by
today's women effectively, such as in education, health care,
employment, political participation, poverty elimination and labor
rights of women workers in joint ventures and private businesses.
</P>
<P>
China plans to control the rate of girl dropouts and girls who
are deprived of education within two percent, and help three
million women become literate each year. It is also making efforts
to eliminate illiteracy among women born after 1949, when New
China was founded, and above the age of 15, by the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Lauds China-Africa Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese president
Jiang Zemin today praised the tried and true friendship between
China and Africa in a speech at the headquarters of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) here.
</P>
<P>
The president said that China and Africa are close in spirit
despite being separated by continents, and friendly exchanges
between the Chinese and African peoples date back to ancient
times.
</P>
<P>
China and Africa have been friends in fair weather and foul on
the basis of full equality, mutual respect and mutual benefit,
Jiang added.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president called for more consultation and
cooperation between China and Africa in international affairs.
</P>
<P>
More than 400 people attended Jiang's address on the theme
"Africa-China relations".
</P>
<P>
In his vote of thanks, OAU Secretary General Salim Ahmed Salim
said Jiang's six-nation African tour was testimony to the
continuing friendship between Africa and China, a relationship
which their peoples value and are determined to strengthen.
</P>
<P>
The OAU chief said that the seeds of friendship sown by
African and Chinese leaders have borne fruit in the broad range of
cooperation between the two continents.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Chinese people have demonstrated selflessness
in their assistance to Africa and in sharing their wealth and
knowledge with the African peoples.
</P>
<P>
Africa could learn from the pragmatic and realistic policies
China has embarked on to modernize and transform its economy, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian Foreign Minister Ato Seyoum Mesfin, who also spoke
after Jiang's address, said that China has always been and
continues to be a true and reliable friend of Africa.
</P>
<P>
China had proved itself one of the few consistent supporters of
causes that are dear to the African peoples, he said.
</P>
<P>
China's espousal of the principles of full equality, mutual
respect and mutual benefit in its foreign policy was one of the
reasons why China has always been held in high esteem, not only in
Africa but throughout the developing world, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia is the second leg of Jiang's two-week visit to Africa,
which has so far taken him to Kenya. He is scheduled to travel to
Egypt, Mali, Namibia and Zimbabwe.

<P>
TAIYUAN, May 13 (Xinhua) -- China has vowed to strengthen the
work on prices in its rural areas and will take effective steps to
protect farmers' interests.
</P>
<P>
According to a national conference on rural prices held

The country will protect the prices for key agricultural
produce in an effort to prevent such prices from soaring or
dropping sharply. Key agricultural products include grain, cotton,
pigs and silkworm cocoons.

<P>
It will overcome the negative impact that the current market
mechanism has had on agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
China will also regulate the price order in rural areas and
take measures to protect farmers' interests against unreasonable
charges and price hikes.
</P>
<P>
The steps include supervision of prices that affect rural life,
of fertilizers and electricity in particular, in a bid to relieve
the farmers of their burdens.
</P>
<P>
The conference also urged the government to accelerate the
establishment of a proper price system in rural areas.

The Daily Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- The IRA is "fully primed" for a return to all-out
violence in Northern Ireland, according to intelligence

<HEADLINE> Israel Carries Out Gradual Redeployment From Hebron </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 13 (Xinhua) -- In view of the forthcoming
Israeli general elections, the Israeli government and Palestinian
Authority have agreed on a gradual army redeployment from Hebron
and the process is expected to be completed by the middle of June.
</P>
<P>
The modality was agreed upon by Israel's chief negotiator and
Foreign Ministry Director-General Uri Savir and Palestinian chief
negotiator and member of the PLO Executive Committee after a week
of parallel military talks between Head of Central Command
Maj.-Gen. Uzi Dayan and Palestinian Police head Gen. Haj
Ismail. It was approved at the weekly cabinet meeting Sunday.
</P>
<P>
According to Oslo 2 agreement, Israel was to leave about 85
percent of the West bank city by March 28, remaining in control
of the areas inhabited by the estimated 400 Jewish settlers
there. Prime Minister Shimon Peres postponed the pullout due to
the spate of suicide bombings in Israel in late February and
early March.
</P>
<P>
Peres did not want to pull back from Hebron before the May 29
elections so as not to alienate potential religious voters.
</P>
<P>
As a signal to the Palestinians that Israel is intent on
ultimately redeploying from Hebron, it has agreed on the
redeployment of Norwegian observers there, just as the Temporary
International Presence in Hebron was briefly deployed after the
1994 massacre of Moslems in the city.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli military authorities have repeatedly declared that
they could finish the pullout in a matter of hours. Much of the
military equipments have already been moved from the city.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Civil Administration and the Palestinian
Authority began on transferring the remaining civil authority in
Hebron. The last spheres of responsibility will be handed over
soon. Today, Israeli border guards are beginning to remove
antennas and communications wiring from the top of the Hebron
Administration Building.

<HEADLINE> China Makes Breakthrough in Rubber Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 13 (Xinhua) -- China has made a major breakthrough
in its butadiene rubber project, which has involved the joint
efforts of some 80 domestic organizations for several decades.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Zengyue, president of the China Association of the
Synthetic Rubber Industry, said that China has already put into
operation five butadiene rubber production centers, each with an
annual production capacity of more than 10,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
They are located in Yanshan near Beijing, Jinzhou in Liaoning
province, Gaoqiao near Shanghai, Zibo in Shandong Province and
Yueyang in Hunan Province, which make synthetic rubber products
badly needed by domestic economic construction.
</P>
<P>
China turned out 220,000 tons of butadiene rubber last year,
accounting for about 10 percent of the world's annual output.
</P>
<P>
China's butadiene rubber output stood at only 10,000 tons in
the 1970s, when the industry first started.
</P>
<P>
Butadiene rubber is widely used in the making of tires,
industrial tubes and shoes and is closed related to national
defense, economic construction and scientific progress.
</P>
<P>
China started attaching great importance to the rubber
materials industry in the 1950s, when 10 tons of rice could be
exchanged for one ton of other countries' natural rubber.
</P>
<P>
China plans to put into operation some other butadiene rubber
projects in Xinjiang, Maoming and Daqing, respectively, in the
next five years, and the production capacity is expected to hit
420,000 tons by the end of this century.
</P>
<P>
China exports butadiene rubber to some 20 countries and
regions.

<HEADLINE> Property Rights Registration Lauded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 13 (Xinhua) -- China's efforts to register state
property rights have played a significant role in safeguarding the
interests of the State, according to senior officials.
</P>
<P>
The registration of state property rights has enalbed
enterprises to know better their rights, duties and interests,
Zhang Youcai, director of the State Administration of State
Property (SASP), told a national meeting here today on state
property rights.
</P>
<P>
Zhang, also vice-minister of finance, said that the property
rights registration certificate, as a legal paper, has also been
helpful to the settlement of property rights disputes.
</P>
<P>
Property rights registration, which was first started in China
in 1990, has to some extent helped standardize the investment
methods of some government departments and enterprises, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the efforts to register property rights has also
enabled the authorities to closely follow the performance of
enterprises, which is conducive to government policy-making and
the curbing of the loss of state property.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that changes in state-owned property rights
were reported in more than 30,000 enterprises in
1994. Consequently, the value of the state-owned property
involved, which was previously worth 160 billion yuan (about 19
billion US dollars), increased by a net 150 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
In the four years between 1990 and 1994, property rights were
registered by a total of 297,057 enterprises, in which the State
had capital and interests worth 3.0522 trillion yuan, according to
statistics.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Zhigang, deputy director of the SASP, said that what is
urgent now is get property rights registered in more
enterprises. He quoted the latest official data as saying that
China currently has 302,000 state-owned non-financial enterprises.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that in the next one or two years China will
strive to establish a system which requires all enterprises to
report to the authorities their record of running state property.
</P>
<P>
Registration and management of property rights among domestic
enterprises, Sino-foreign joint ventures and overseas Chinese
firms will be bolstered, Zhu added.
</P>
<P>
He said that "the key to getting enterprises out of the red and
reducing their debt-to-assets ratio lies in establishing a proper
management and supervisory system for state property".

<HEADLINE> Israel Continues Bombardment in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Israel today continued bombing at
pro-Iranian Hezbollah guerrillas in south Lebanon following
guerrillas' attacks Sunday at Israeli forces in the so-called
"security zone."
</P>
<P>
Security sources in south Lebanon said that the Israeli
occupation forces at Zafata fired artilleries at the villages of
Arab Salim, Wadi Akhdar and Jebal Safi at Iglim Al-Toffah since
earlier this morning.
</P>
<P>
One shell in every five minutes was fired to the area, the
security sources said, adding that no casualties have been caused.
</P>
<P>
Guerrillas of the Lebanese pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of
God, launched attacks at an Israeli patrol and an outpost in the
bordering buffer strip Sunday morning, wounding five Israeli
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The assaults were the first in which Hezbollah militants
inflicted casualties on the Israelis since last month's 16-day
blitz on Lebanon by the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Beirut press described the attacks as the first test of the
US-broked cease-fire which went into effect on April 27.
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes rapidly struck back, firing rockets into
suspected Hezbollah bases in Mlita hills in the Iglim Al-Toffah
mountain area, a place often used by Hezbollah's Shiite
guerrillas to launch attack at targets in southern Lebanon and
northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israeli artillery also resumed intensive shelling at the
area. There were no reports of casualties on the Lebanese side.
</P>
<P>
The April 26 cease-fire understanding, which banned firing from
or at civilians, however, did not rule out attacks by Hezbollah
guerrillas on Israeli targets in the 15-kilometer wide border
zone and allowed both sides the right of self-defense.

<P>
HONG KONG, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The value of Hong Kong's

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Mull National Defense Draft Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The Draft Law on National Defense,
submitted to China's top legislature Saturday for deliberation,
was regarded as basically feasible and urged to be adopted after
revisions by legislators here today.
</P>
<P>
Formulating such a law is necessary for the muscling up of the
country's defense, defending territorial integrity, and
maintaining world peace and long-term domestic stability, and
should be passed after revisions, they maintained in panel
discussions of the current session of the National People's
Congress (NPC) Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
Various proposals on improving the draft were aired in debates.
</P>
<P>
The principle of combining defense-industry technologies with
civilian-use production, while giving priority to military
production and supporting the military with civilian production
spelled out in the draft law is in accordance with Deng Xiaoping's
theory on building the Chinese armed forces in the new era, said
legislator Lin Zongtang.
</P>
<P>
To put this principle into actual operation, the law should
make relevant guarantees and ensure the coordinated growth of both
defense and civilian industries, he said.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Huang Yuzhang said that it should be made
crystal-clear that China will commit itself to world peace and
never seek hegemony in the world arena, nor pose any threat to
other countries.

<HEADLINE> 12 Presidents Inaugurate Trans-Asian Railway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MASHHAD, IRAN, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Twelve presidents
inaugurated here today a trans-Asian railway which links
landlocked Central Asian republics with the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani said at the
inauguration ceremony that the Mashhad-Sarakhs-Tajan railway will
"revive the historical Silk Road and will link the railway
networks of Asia and Europe from the coasts of Pacific Ocean to
the Atlantic."
</P>
<P>
The ceremony is the grandest that Iran has ever had in the past
decade, especially since Rafsanjani came to power seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the event has much more political
significance than economic one. Iran regards the completion of the
railway as a success in its struggle against the U.S. attempt to
isolate Iran, they said.
</P>
<P>
The railway is 295 kilometers long, including 165 kilometers in
the Iranian territory and 130 kilometers on the soil of
Turkmenistan.
</P>
<P>
It will allow the Central Asian countries and even China to
have further access to the Persian Gulf through Iran and to the
Mediterranean through Turkey.
</P>
<P>
In Iran, the railroad is connected with the Bafgh-Bandar Abbas
railway, with the two adding up to a total distance of 2,620
kilometers from the Iranian-Turkmenistan border to the coast of
the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani, President of Turkmenistan Saparmurat Niyatsov and
10 other presidents from Afghanistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan,
Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrghyzstan, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkey and
Uzbekistan attended the ceremony held at the Mashhad Station.
</P>
<P>
High-ranking government officials from such countries as
Russia, China, Ukraine, Syria, Cuba, the Philippines and Malaysia
were also present.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Mahmoud Vaezi told Xinhua
earlier that "12 presidents, two vice-presidents, several deputy
prime ministers and a lot of ministers, altogether 56 delegations"
would participate in the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Niyatsov pledged that his country will make further efforts to
promote regional cooperation by launching the railway with Iran.
</P>
<P>
Turkish President Suleiman Demirel said that it was a source
of pleasure to see Iran's success in implementing the project
linking Central Asia to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
Afghan President Burhanuddin Rabbani hailed the railway project
as a blessing for the economic and political security of the
whole region.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani President Farooq Ahmad Leghari said that the railroad
will help improve the economic situation of the regional
countries.
</P>
<P>
President of Uzbekistan Islam Karimov said that Iran took a
key step toward the development of regional cooperation by
launching the trans-Asian railway.
</P>
<P>
President of Kyrghyzstan Askar Akayev called the opening of the
railway a historical event on the threshold of the 21st century,
saying that it plays an important role in bolstering the
friendship and development of the regional countries.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Vaezi said, "You can
see right now. If Iran is isolated, there will not be so many
delegations for this ceremony."
</P>
<P>
At today's ceremony, Rafsanjani described the railway as a good
example of regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"I want to thank our friends in Turkmenistan, especially His
Excellency Mr. Saparmurat Niyatsov for his personal interest and
effort that ensured completion of the Tajan-Sarakhs segment of the
railroad in Turkmenistan on time," he said. Sarakhs is an Iranian
town on the border with Turkmenistan.
</P>
<P>
"Expansion of communications, roads and railway network, access
to world markets and mutually reinforced and beneficial relations
in the region can enhance amity, confidence and trust among
governments and lead to mutual understanding and greater
solidarity," he added.

<HEADLINE> China Living up to Sino-US IPR Accord: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 13 (Xinhua) -- China has fully implemented the
Sino-US intellectual property rights (IPR) agreement signed last
year, a senior Chinese copyright official said here today.
</P>
<P>
China has made breakthroughs in nationwide crackdowns on piracy
and already contained the once-rampant infringement of IPR in some
areas, said Wang Huapeng, director of the Copyright Department of
the National Copyright Administration (NCA).
</P>
<P>
"China has done a better job than any other country in the
world in its resolute protection of IPR, fulfillment of
international obligations and use of administrative powers to
close down plants producing counterfeit CD products," the official
said.
</P>
<P>
According to him, it is rare for disputes concerning IPR to be
settled by government and judicial departments, as in China, as
most are handled by courts only.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two years six Chinese ministries, commissions or
bureaus have joined hands in the nationwide effort to wipe out IPR
infringement and piracy, including the State Press and
Publications Administration (SPPA), the NCA, the Ministry of
Culture, and the State Administration for Industry and Commerce.
</P>
<P>
China has also passed a number of laws and regulations
concerning IPR protection, becoming one of the few countries with
a full IPR protection system.
</P>
<P>
During the last two nationwide winter campaigns against piracy,
six CD plants were closed down and their licenses were revoked
after they were found to have produced pirated or pornographic
products in Guangdong, Jiangsu and Hainan provinces.
</P>
<P>
China's all-out efforts directed at piracy and its efforts to
protect IPR have been motivated by its own need to promote the
development of its culture and publications in a healthy and
orderly manner.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the reports by some overseas media that there are
more than 40 CD plants in China churning out counterfeit CDs, Wang
said such reports are false, adding there are only 34 CD plants in
China, including three which were denied re-registration during
the past nationwide rectification efforts.
</P>
<P>
He said 29 of the 31 CD plants re-registered by the SPPA are
joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
The SPPA and NCA have sent two officials to each of the 31 CD
factories to supervise their production and make sure they do not
violate IPR, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
The official said the supervisors will be replaced every three
months so as to ensure that the supervision is effective and just,
Wang said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that both the NCA and SPPA have ordered the CD plants
to print "source identification data" on their products so that
those without such information can be easily recognized as illegal.
</P>
<P>
Like drug smuggling and abuse, IPR piracy is an international
issue, and it is very difficult to root it out in a short period
of time, the official said.
</P>
<P>
"China will continue to take stern actions against
infringements and protect the legitimate rights and interests of
IPR owners," Wang added.

<HEADLINE> Official: Russia Seeks More Active Role in Middle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Russian Deputy Foreign Minister
Victor Posevalyuk said here today that one of the major purposes
of his current visit to Lebanon is to seek Russia's more active
role in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Following his meeting with Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez
Boueiz, Posevalyuk voiced Russia's desire to consolidate its
relations with Lebanon, saying that his visit is aimed to "put
into effect the active policy which (Russia) has been talking
about generally."
</P>
<P>
The talks between the two officials dealt with a cease-fire
understanding reached between Lebanon's guerrillas of Hezbollah,
or Party of God, and Israeli forces on April 26 and all details
related to the proposed committee monitoring the cease-fire and
consultative committee, he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed Russia's keenness to have consultations and
exchange views with lebanon on all what has happened.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference following his one-hour meeting with
Boueiz, the Russian official said that his country "respects
Lebanon's sovereignty and supports the implementation of
(U.N. Security Council) resolution 425, " which calls for Israel's
withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
On the cease-fire understanding which put an end to 16 days of
Israeli military offensives in southern Lebanon last month,
Posevalyuk said that Russia supports the agreement in principle
"despite some points which we do not agree on."
</P>
<P>
He noted that Russia would be a member in the proposed
consultative committee because "we are with Lebanon's
reconstruction and rehabilitation," noting that the formation of
this committee "needs some time."
</P>
<P>
The consultative committee, proposed in the April 26
understanding, is aimed at accumulating international assistances
for Lebanon's rehabilitation of the infrastructure damaged in the
Israeli military operations.
</P>
<P>
Posevalyuk underlined the necessity "not to give the monitoring
committee any political color," saying that the committee should
"only have a technical nature" and its function should be limited
to the security.
</P>
<P>
Under the cease-fire understanding, the monitoring committee
comprising the United States, France, Israel, Syria and Lebanon
is to be set up in order to supervise the enforcement of the
cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
The Russian deputy foreign minister arrived here this morning
from Damascus.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Man Arrested For Alleged Bigamy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 13 (Xinhua) -- A Sri Lankan who is alleged to have
married 54 women within five years in different parts of the
country, was arrested by police recently, according to the Daily
News, an official newspaper here.
</P>
<P>
M. Dammika Perera, Sinhalese, 36 years old, who has married 53
women with 32 names, was arrested at Rakwana in the Southeast of
the country, during his 54th marriage ceremony, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The suspect had confessed to the marriages and the crime of
having decamped with money, jewelry and other valuables from those
women he had lived with earlier, the paper quoted police as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Under Sri Lanka's Sinhalese Marriage law, an adult can only be
married to one spouse at any time and he or she could be married
again only after legally divorcing the first spouse.
</P>
<P>
Marrying a second time or more before nullifying the first
marriage amounts to bigamy, an offense punishable by imprisonment,
according to the law.

<HEADLINE> 12 Presidents Inaugurate Trans-Asian Railway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MASHHAD, IRAN, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Twelve presidents
inaugurated here today a trans-Asian railway which links
landlocked Central Asian republics with the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani said at the
inauguration ceremony that the Mashhad-Sarakhs-Tajan railway will
"revive the historical Silk Road and will link the railway
networks of Asia and Europe from the coasts of Pacific Ocean to
the Atlantic."
</P>
<P>
The ceremony is the grandest that Iran has ever had in the past
decade, especially since Rafsanjani came to power seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the event has much more political
significance than economic one. Iran regards the completion of the
railway as a success in its struggle against the U.S. attempt to
isolate Iran, they said.
</P>
<P>
The railway is 295 kilometers long, including 165 kilometers in
the Iranian territory and 130 kilometers on the soil of
Turkmenistan from Sarakhs to Tajan.
</P>
<P>
It will allow the Central Asian countries and even China to
have further access to the Persian Gulf through Iran and to the
Mediterranean through Turkey.
</P>
<P>
In Iran, the railroad is connected with the Bafgh-Bandar Abbas
railway, with the two adding up to a total distance of 2,620
kilometers from the Iranian-Turkmenistan border to the coast of
the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani, President of Turkmenistan Saparmurat Niyatsov and
10 other presidents from Afghanistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan,
Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrghyzstan, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkey and
Uzbekistan attended the ceremony held at the Mashhad Station.
</P>
<P>
High-ranking government officials from such countries as
Russia, China, Ukraine, Syria, Cuba, the Philippines and Malaysia
were also present.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Mahmoud Vaezi told Xinhua
earlier that "12 presidents, two vice-presidents, several deputy
prime ministers and a lot of ministers, altogether 56 delegations"
would participate in the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Niyatsov pledged that his country will make further efforts to
promote regional cooperation by launching the railway with Iran.
</P>
<P>
Turkish President Suleiman Demirel said that it was a source
of pleasure to see Iran's success in implementing the project
linking Central Asia to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
Afghan President Burhanuddin Rabbani hailed the railway project
as a blessing for the economic and political security of the
whole region.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani President Farooq Ahmad Leghari said that the railroad
will help improve the economic situation of the regional
countries.
</P>
<P>
President of Uzbekistan Islam Karimov said that Iran took a
key step toward the development of regional cooperation by
launching the trans-Asian railway.
</P>
<P>
President of Kyrghyzstan Askar Akayev called the opening of the
railway a historical event on the threshold of the 21st century,
saying that it plays an important role in bolstering the
friendship and development of the regional countries.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Vaezi said, "You can
see right now. If Iran is isolated, there will not be so many
delegations for this ceremony."
</P>
<P>
At today's ceremony, Rafsanjani described the railway as a good
example of regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"I want to thank our friends in Turkmenistan, especially His
Excellency Mr. Saparmurat Niyatsov for his personal interest and
effort that ensured completion of the Tajan-Sarakhs segment of the
railroad in Turkmenistan on time," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Expansion of communications, roads and railway network, access
to world markets and mutually reinforced and beneficial relations
in the region can enhance amity, confidence and trust among
governments and lead to mutual understanding and greater
solidarity," he added.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Instals New Digital Telephone Exchange </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzania
Telecommunications Company Limited (TTCL) has installed a new
digital telephone exchange with a capacity of 10,000 lines at the
Telephone House here to offer subscribers a special service known
as "password".
</P>
<P>
A TTCL official said today the new exchange would also boost
the company's services to the customers.
</P>
<P>
He said, the new telephone exchange has also 6,000 lines for
the up-country.
</P>
<P>
He added that the password service would identify genuine
subscribers when making calls, saying that the new exchange would
also help subscribers to make direct international calls.
</P>
<P>
The computerised telephone exchange, technically known as
"neax 16 digital switch", will indicate the bill, the caller's
number as well as the number he or she is desired to call.
</P>
<P>
"All the data are stored in magnetic tapes, so it won't be
easy for people to make any changes", noted the TTCL official.
</P>
<P>
He further said the introduction of a modern telephone
exchange would reduce complaints from the customers regarding the
charges of telephones.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the TTCL has established costomer services centres
with more than 22,000 new lines in the city in an effort to meet
people's demand.
</P>
<P>
A total of four customer centres are in their final stages.
</P>
<P>
The centres would offer services like payment of telephone
bills, telex, fax, reporting of telephone faults as well as
receiving applications for new telephone lines.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 13 (Xinhua) -- A survey has shown that male
teachers are becoming more common in the traditionally female
domain of the kindergarten.
</P>
<P>
The survey of 204 directors and teachers of kindergarten and
284 parents in this leading industrial and commercial city, showed
that 52.9 percent believe the idea of men teaching in kindergarten
deserves recognition, and 75.5 percent agreed that male teachers
will be welcomed by children.
</P>
<P>
As members of the first group of teachers trained specially for
kindergarten teaching, Shen Li and his 40 classmates were selected
by several big schools in Shanghai when they made their meeting
with the public recently.
</P>
<P>
Qiu Xiaoyun, director of a kindergarten in the Pudong New Area,
where two male teachers have been hired, said that male teachers
can care for children as well as females can, and Children are
happy to play with these "uncles".
</P>
<P>
A teacher from Beijing explained that involving male teachers
in pre-school education is good for the formation of the complete
personality of children.
</P>
<P>
In the past, mothers, babysitters, nursery-school teachers, and
female teachers in primary school were the world in which children
grew up, and as a result, children usually learned female behavior.
</P>
<P>
The aim of providing male teachers in kindergarten is to
optimize educational opportunities there.

<HEADLINE> China To Strengthen Cooperation with OAU: Chinese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese President
Jiang Zemin said here this morning China is ready to strengthen
consultations and cooperation on issues of common concern with
the Organization of African Unity (OAU) under the new
international situation.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, in a meeting with OAU's Secretary General Salim Ahmed
Salim, said China welcomes Salim and other OAU officials to visit
China and will send officials to consult with the OAU.
</P>
<P>
Salim said the relations between the OAU and China have been
further enhanced since he visited China three years ago.
</P>
<P>
He said Jiang's visit comes at a time when Africa has
undergone profound political and economic changes so the visit
will further enhance the long-standing friendly relations between
African nations and China.
</P>
<P>
The OAU hopes that China will play a more positive role in
helping maintain peace and development in Africa, he said, adding
the OAU is willing to establish consultations with China on
regular basis.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that China has always treasured the friendship
with Africa and attached great importance to the roles of African
countries and the OAU in international affairs.
</P>
<P>
China is willing to consolidate and develop its Africa ties of
equality, sincerity, friendship, unity, cooperation and common
development, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three decades, Jiang recalled, the Chinese
government has always supported the OAU's effort to seek
political liberation, national stability and economic development
of the African nations.
</P>
<P>
China also has been against the interference of external
forces into Africa's internal affairs, Jiang added.
</P>
<P>
Salim said the OAU appreciates the support China has given to
Africa's struggle for liberation in the past and the endeavor for
peaceful development at present.
</P>
<P>
At present, he said, the most urgent task of Africa is to
restore peace and security and the OAU hopes to work with China
in this regard as well as in the OAU and the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
He added that the OAU hopes to get continued support from
China, a permanent member of the UN Security Council.

<HEADLINE> China's Economy Enjoys Sustained, Rapid, Sound </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- China's economy is moving along the
track of sustained, rapid and sound development with the new
system of socialist market economy gradually taking shape, Chinese
Vice Premier Zhu Rongji said at a high-level economic forum that
opened here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the "Indonesia Summit '96," he said China would
stick to a moderately tight fiscal and monetary policy so as to
keep the inflation rate at single digit and eliminate its budget
deficit before the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter of 1996, China's economy grew by 10.2
percent and its inflation dropped to 7.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
At the start of China's ninth Five-Year Plan for the National
Economic and Social Development this year, China has cut down its
tariff rate by 36 percent and will further lower it in the near
future to the average level of developing countries, said Zhu.
</P>
<P>
He said China would further open up its financial, insurance
and commercial sectors and other service industries and would
achieve the convertibility of the Chinese currency under the
current account in an orderly way in accordance with the
regulations of the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
He said China has already taken a series of important measures
to protect intellectual property rights and will be even more
resolute and effective in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Zhu recalled that China has made great achievements of historic
significance since the late 1970s in its reform, opening-up and
modernization drive guided by Deng Xiaoping's theory of building
socialism with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
The country's gross national product (GNP) grew at a remarkable
average rate of 10 percent annually from 1979 to 1995.
</P>
<P>
Under the leadership of the central authorities with President
Jiang Zemin at the core, China has deepened reforms over the past
five years, as well as improving macro-regulation and bridled
overheating in some economic fields, Zhu said in his speech to the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
The two-day Indonesia Summit is being attended by about 250
senior government officials and 600 top representatives of the
business community from Indonesia and other countries.

<HEADLINE> Control Of Small Scale Gemstone Miners Urged In </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Control of small scale
gemstone miners has been urged in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The urgement was made by the participants of the on-going
sixth International Gemstone Show at Novotel Mount Meru in
northern Tanzania city Arusha, organized by Tanzania Mineral
Dealers Associations (TAMIDA).
</P>
<P>
The particants said that uncontrolled production of various
gemstones in Tanzania was likely to ruin the world market for the
precious stones and hence sooner or later the values and prices
will drop.
</P>
<P>
The Managing Director of Gem and Rock Ventures Limited, Mr.
Sammy Mollel said that it was the culture of the small scale
miners to sell their gems as soon as they got them so that they
may survive and solve some of their immediate problems. By so
doing, he warned that the supplies of precious stones in the
market is slowly becoming higher and this trend would definitely
affect the prices.
</P>
<P>
He sugguested that in order to control the problem the
government should have a special unit to buy minerals from the
dealers and then export them to the world market in phases.
</P>
<P>
This year's gemstone show, which was officially opened by the
Principal Secretary in the Ministry of Energy and Minerals, Dr.
Jonas Kipokola, attracted more than 50 participants including
gemstone dealers, buyers, brokers from 15 countries. The show
continues today.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President on International Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The international situation is
on the whole moving toward relaxation but it is far from tranquil
as hegemonism and power politics still exist, Chinese President
Jiang Zemin said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Organization of African Unity (OAU) on
Sino-African friendship, Jiang said that a broad overview of the
post-Cold War world reveals a scene of tremendous, complicated and
profound changes and that the trend toward multipolarity is making
further headway.
</P>
<P>
World peace, national stability, economic growth and social
progress have become the dominating theme of present-day world,
the Chinese president said.
</P>
<P>
While rising in political status, the developing nations, where
a bulk of the world's population live, are also experiencing
faster economic growth, with their share of world gross national
product (GNP) increasing steadily, he said.
</P>
<P>
The developing countries are demanding a bigger say in
international affairs, as they are the main force in maintaining
world peace and promoting the establishment of a just and
equitable new international political and economic order, Jiang
said.
</P>
<P>
However, "the world is not tranquil as hegemonism and power
politics still exist," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The gap between the rich and the poor countries keeps widening
and the conditions for human survival and development remain
threatened.
</P>
<P>
Jiang contended that the evolving international situation has
presented China and Africa with both opportunities and challenges.
</P>
<P>
Jiang arrived in Ethiopia, the second leg of his six-nation
African tour, on Saturday. He will go to Egypt, Mali, Namibia and
Zimbabwe after concluding his visit here.

<HEADLINE> Africa Enters New Historical Era, Jiang Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Africa is entering a new
historical era characterized by pursuit of peace, stability and
development, visiting Chinese President Jiang Zemin said here
today.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people are pleased to see that stability has
returned in most African countries, Jiang said during a speech on
Sino-African friendship at the Organization of African Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
The birth of the new South Africa marked the accomplishment of
the mission of political liberation in Africa, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He said major steps forward have been taken in regional
cooperation and both the demand for and the trend toward strength
through unity are growing.
</P>
<P>
He said an increasing number of countries are striving to
explore political and developmental models suited to their
national conditions.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that with over 50 countries that make up about half
of the membership of the Non-Aligned Movement and nearly one-third
of the membership of the United Nations, Africa has always been an
important force in preserving world peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
A peaceful and prosperous world cannot last if a stable and
economically developing Africa cannot be ensured, Jiang told his
audience.
</P>
<P>
African economy as a whole remains in hard time and there is
still a long way to go for the continent to achieve economic
take-off, Jiang noted.
</P>
<P>
Among the difficulties hindering efforts of African nations are
a weak economic base, caused by hundreds of years of colonial
exploitation and plunder, and many unfavorable external factors
for African development, caused by lack of fundamental changes to
the unjust and inequitable international economic order left over
from the past, Jiang added.
</P>
<P>
"I am confident, that the people of all African countries,
persistent and pioneering as they are, will surely overcome their
difficulties and take a faster pace toward a promising future,"
Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
During the speech, Jiang also praised the OAU for its role in
the cause of political liberation and economic development in
Africa in more than three decades.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government and people have always supported the
work of OAU and are ready to further strengthen their solidarity
and cooperation with it," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia is the second leg of Jiang's six-nation African tour,
which has taken him to Kenya. He will go to Egypt, Mali, Namibia
and Zimbabwe after ending his visit here.

<HEADLINE> China's Development Conducive to Sino-African Ties: Jiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese President
Jiang Zemin said here today that development in his country would
be conducive to the Sino-African relations.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, in a speech at the Organization of African Unity (OAU)
during the second leg of his two-week African tour, briefed a
local audience about China's recent developments.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people led by the Chinese Communist Party have
taken decisive steps in building a strong and prosperous country
along the road of Chinese-style socialism, the president declared.
</P>
<P>
At present, he said, the Chinese government and people are
faced with three main tasks: modernization drive, national
reunification and preservation of world peace.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to unswervingly pursue our independent
foreign policy of peace and persist in taking economic development
as our central task while focusing on reform and opening-up," he
said.
</P>
<P>
By year 2000, the president said, "while our population will be
300 million greater than that of 1980, our per capita gross
national product (GNP) will quadruple the 1980 figure, allowing
our people to live a comfortable life and our socialist market
structure to take initial shape."
</P>
<P>
By 2010, he added, "we will double the GNP again on the 2000
basis."
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that China will resume the exercise of its
sovereignty over Hong Kong and Macao successively in the next
three years or so, which he said is "an eloquent proof that the
Chinese people are fully capable and confident of removing any
interference to accomplish the great cause of national
reunification."
</P>
<P>
He said that China's reform and opening-up policies and new
plans for economic and social development have been formulated in
line with its national conditions and the features of the times.
</P>
<P>
The policies and plans, Jiang explained, are aimed at further
emancipating and developing the productive forces, improving
Chinese people's living standards and increasing the country's
aggregate national power.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Our experience tells us, to ensure a sustained, rapid
and healthy economic growth, we must pay close attention to and
correctly handle the relationship among reform, development and
stability."
</P>
<P>
"Reform is the powerful driving force behind economic and
social development. Stability is the important precondition for
both reform and development," Jiang asserted.
</P>
<P>
"Greater openness to the outside world and self-reliance should
also be well-coordinated," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president went on to elaborate that self-reliance should
form the basis for active promotion of regional economic
cooperation and extensive international economic and trade
exchanges; and that while making use of foreign capital, it is
necessary to stress domestic capital accumulation with a view to
quickly narrowing the economic gap between China and the developed
countries.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese head of state told his audience that China is
trying to promote an overall social progress by making development
of science and education, population control and environmental
protection its basic state policies and by implementing the
strategy of sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
China's development, the president said, "will provide a more
favorable condition and open up a broader prospect for
Sino-African friendship and cooperation."

<HEADLINE> Jiang Calls for Stronger Sino-African Relationship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
called today for a stronger Sino-African relationship and
presented a five-point proposal and observation to that end.
</P>
<P>
The president, here on an African tour, said China "is ready to
consolidate and develop a long-term and stable relationship of
all-round cooperation with all African countries."
</P>
<P>
He told an audience at the Organization of African Unity (OAU)
that the Sino-African relationship, based on the Five Principles
of Peaceful Coexistence, is oriented toward the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese President appealed to African countries to join
work together with his country toward "a new historical milestone
of the eternal Sino-African friendship."
</P>
<P>
His proposal and observation on the development of the
Sino-African relationship include:
</P>
<P>
-- to foster a sincere friendship and become each other's
reliable "all-weather friend;"
</P>
<P>
-- to treat each other as equals, respect each other's
sovereignty and refrain from interfering in each other's internal
affairs;
</P>
<P>
-- to seek common development on the basis of mutual benefit;
</P>
<P>
-- to increase consultation and cooperation in international
affairs; and
</P>
<P>
-- to look into the future and create a more splendid world.
</P>
<P>
China and Africa shared similar experience in the past and are
faced with the common task today, Jiang noted. "Africa needs
China, and China also needs Africa."
</P>
<P>
Based on a firm foundation, Sino-African friendship has passed
on from generation to generation and withstood the test of
history, he said. "It will never change with the passing of the
time and shifts in the world pattern."
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the Chinese Government signed more than one
month ago, without attaching any conditions or making any
reservations, relevant proposals to the African
Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty.
</P>
<P>
This move, he said, "embodies China's consistent support for
Africa's just actions as well as its sincere friendship toward the
African people."
</P>
<P>
On international issues, the president said that China has all
along stood for the complete prohibition and thorough destruction
of nuclear weapons, and attached great importance to and taken an
active part in the negotiations for a comprehensive ban on nuclear
testing.
</P>
<P>
China is ready to join African countries and all other
peace-loving countries in an unremitting effort to promote nuclear
disarmament and realize the ultimate goal of complete prohibition
and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons worldwide, he added.

<HEADLINE> Locust Swarms Sweep Through Harare Suburbs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Huge swarms of red locusts swept
through Harare, Zimbabwe's capital yesterday, heading towards the
southwestern part of the city, the daily Herald reported today.
</P>
<P>
Huge swarms of locusts covered the open space opposite the
Borrowdale race course, prompting motorists and passersby to stop.
Such a sight had probably not been seen before for decades, the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
The crop protection unit has been alerted of the locusts which are
believed to be coming from Mozambique. Although no crop damage has
been reported so far, fears have been raised of possible destruction
of the winter wheat crop.
</P>
<P>
An official from the Crop Protection Unit said although the unit
was worried, it was premature to raise an alarm as they were still
monitoring the situation. enditem

<HEADLINE> China Proposes Measures for Asia-Pacific Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice Premier Zhu Rongji
today offered a three-point proposal for regional cooperation in
the Asia-Pacific in efforts to maintain and promote sustained
economic development in the region.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening of a two-day Indonesian economic Summit
(high-level economic forum) here, Zhu said the trends toward
global economic integration and regionalization are both gaining
strength and that with the most dynamic economy in the world, the
Asia-Pacific region has become another locomotive for world
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
In the interest of maintaining and promoting sustained economic
growth in the region, Zhu said, China would like to offer the
following ideas:
</P>
<P>
First, he said, the Asia-Pacific countries should further
enhance economic cooperation on the basis of equality and mutual
benefit, mutual openness, long-term cooperation, and common
development. Such cooperation is open and non-exclusive and goes
hand in hand with global development, he said.
</P>
<P>
The region needs a world committed to peace and development,
while the world also needs a stable and developing Asia-Pacific
region, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Second, Zhu said, the Asia-Pacific countries should take more
flexible and effective measures to explore new areas of
cooperation. Apart from trade and investment, they should also
cooperate in a wide range of areas of shared concern such as
poverty elimination, environmental protection, technology
transfer, infrastructure construction, development in human
resources, the financial sector and other services, he said.
</P>
<P>
Finally, the region's countries should set up economic
coordination and dialogue at various levels, through various
channels and in various fields. At the same time, non-government
exchanges and cooperation should be encouraged, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu voiced China's readiness to take an active part in APEC
(the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum) activities and
continue to support the efforts of ASEAN (the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations) in promoting regional peace and
development.
</P>
<P>
China will also participate in the development of the Mekong
river valley, the construction of the pan-Asian railway and other
fields of regional economic cooperation, he added.
</P>
<P>
The economic forum, which was jointly organized by the
International Herald Tribune and Indonesia's Ministry of
Production and Distribution, is being attended by about 250 senior
government officials and 600 top representatives of the business
community from Indonesia and foreign countries.

<HEADLINE> Rebels Resume Offensive In Northern Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Rebels of the Lords Resistance
Army (LRA) led by Joseph Kony resumed operations in Gulu District
in northern Uganda before the final results of the May 9
presidential elections were announced.
</P>
<P>
The rebels, according to a report reaching here today, yesterday
set ablaze a vehicle belonging to a Sudanese catholic priest.
</P>
<P>
The ambush took place on the Kitgum-Lira road.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the IRA rebels have been dropping
leaflets in Koch in the district, announcing that they were resuming
their offensives against the government troops, given the fact that
Yoweri Museveni had won the elections.
</P>
<P>
The rebels are said to have resumed their operations in gulu
district soon after partial results revealed Museveni was heading
for victory.
</P>
<P>
This comes only 15 days into a 40-day cease-fire declared by the
LRA on April 26 to "allow people (to) participate" in the presidential
elections.
</P>
<P>
In their rallies, the rebels have been urging locals to vote for
presidential candidate Paul Ssemogerere.
</P>
<P>
Ssemogerere won 90 percent of the votes in Gulu and Kitgum
districts.
</P>
<P>
The rebels reportedly also robbed food from the civilians in the
districts yesterday afternoon. enditem

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Sets Up High-Power Committee On Energy Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's federal government has set
up a presidential committee to explore the possibility of
evolving an energy policy for the country.
</P>
<P>
The committee, sitting in the presidency, is currently
studying a draft submited to that effect by the energy committe
and is drawn from relevant sectors of the economy, including the
Ministry of Petroleum Resources, the Ministry of Power and Steel
and the Ministry of Finance, among others.
</P>
<P>
The committee's teams of reference include studying the draft
and making amendments before forwarding its recommendations to
the presidency.
</P>
<P>
According to official sources, the committe, set up to
determine how the nation's abundant energy esources including
oil, gas, nuclear, water, and coal would be exploited or
conserved, has been summoned to defend the draft.
</P>
<P>
The recent move by the governmnt to produce the energy policy
is based on the realization that such a policy is very important
to the overall dvelopment of the energy sector and the economy as
a whole, sources said.
</P>
<P>
Besides regulation of the exploitatitn, consumption and
conservation of the energy resources, the policy may also contain
incentives that could attract both local and foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Sources said many oil experts and industry operators have
called on the government for several time to put in place a
funtional energy policy for the country. And the latest
government move is seen as a rsponse to the calls, they added.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear when the framwork of he policy will be ready,
but an official with the Ministry of Petroelum Resources said it
might not be long as the head of state General Sani Abacha would
only need to endorse it before the policy would be made public.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Delivers Speech on Sino-African Friendship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
delivered a speech on Sino-African friendship at the Organization
of African Unity (OAU) here today.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that despite the thousands upon thousands of
mountains and rivers that keep China and Africa apart, the two
sides are indeed very close at heart.
</P>
<P>
The friendly exchanges between the Chinese and African peoples
date back to the ancient times and never have they had any
conflicts between them, Jiang noted.
</P>
<P>
The frequent exchanges of high-level visits between the two
sides in the past four decades have propelled Sino-African
friendship and cooperation to grow steadily and yield fruitful
results, he said.
</P>
<P>
The international situation is on the whole moving toward
relaxation and the trend toward multipolarity is making further
headway. However, it is far from being tranquil as hegemonism and
power politics still exist, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang believes that the evolving international situation has
presented China and Africa with both opportunities and challenges.
</P>
<P>
Major steps forward have been taken in regional cooperation and
both the demand for and the trend toward strength through unity
are growing in Africa, the Chinese president said.
</P>
<P>
Africa is entering a new historical era characterized by
pursuit of peace, stability and development. A peaceful and
prosperous world cannot last if a stable and economically
developing Africa cannot be ensured.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, the president also briefed the OAU on China's
reform and opening-up policies.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said China will continue to unswervingly pursue its
independent foreign policy of peace and persist in taking economic
development as its central task while focusing on reform and
opening-up.
</P>
<P>
China will resume the exercise of its sovereignty over Hong
Kong and Macao in the coming years, which is an eloquent proof
that the Chinese people are fully capable and confident of
removing any interference to accomplish the great cause of
national reunification, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang concluded his speech with a five-point proposal and
observation on the development of Sino-African friendship.
</P>
<P>
The proposals and observations include: to foster a sincere
friendship and become each other's reliable "all-weather friend";
to treat each other as equals, respect each other's sovereignty
and refrain from interfering in each other's internal affairs; to
seek common development on the basis of mutual benefit; to
increase consultation and cooperation in international affairs and
to look into the future and create a more splendid world.
</P>
<P>
China, the biggest developing country in the world, is ready to
join hands with Africa, the world's biggest developing continent,
to share weal and woe and march into the 21st century full of
confidence, Jiang added.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia is the second leg of president Jiang's two-week visit
to Africa, which has taken him to Kenya. After winding up his
visit to Ethiopia, Jiang will go to Egypt, Mali, Namibia and
Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> China, Africa Enjoy Long History of Friendship, Jiang Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese and African peoples
are indeed very close at heart and the long cherished friendship
between them will be everlasting, Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said here today.
</P>
<P>
"Distance can not separate true friends, who feel close at
heart even if they are half a world away," Jiang said while
delivering a speech on Sino-African friendship at the Organization
of African Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
Both China and Africa are renowned cradles of the earliest
human civilizations. The friendly exchanges between the Chinese
and African peoples date back to ancient times and never have they
had any conflicts between them, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
China and Africa have similar pasts as they both suffered
tremendously under colonialists and foreign aggressors. In their
respective prolonged struggles for national independence and
liberation, they always sympathized with and supported each other.
</P>
<P>
The courageous resistance put up by the Ethiopian people
against Italian aggressors and the important contributions the
African people made to the defeat of the Axis powers rendered the
Chinese people tremendous encouragement and support in their
resistance against Japanese fascists, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
With the birth of the People's Republic of China and the
successive independence from colonial rule by a host of African
countries, Sino-African relations entered into a new period of
all-round development, Jiang noted.
</P>
<P>
Frequent exchanges of high-level visits have propelled
Sino-African friendship and cooperation to grow steadily and yield
fruitful results, he said.
</P>
<P>
In nearly four decades, Chinese leaders have paid visits to
scores of African nations on many occasions, and over a hundred
leaders from more than forty African countries have visited China.
</P>
<P>
"We had a memorable yesterday" and "enjoy a splendid today,"
Jiang said, "the flower of Sino-African friendship is blooming
with the care and nurturing of the Chinese and African peoples."
</P>
<P>
"We will greet a flourishing tomorrow. The wheels of the times
will surely carry Sino-African friendship into a new stage," the
president said.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that China, the biggest developing country in
the world, is ready to join hands with Africa, the world's biggest
developing continent, to share weal and woe and march into the
21st century full of confidence.
</P>
<P>
Jiang arrived here on May 11 on a two-week African tour, which
has already taken him to Kenya. After winding up the current visit
to Ethiopia, he will go to Egypt, Mali, Namibia and Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Hails Tanzania's Horticulture Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The Managing Director of the
World Bank, Mr. Gautan Kaji, has commended Tanzania for its
flourishing horticulture industry.
</P>
<P>
He said that horticulture was a very high value added industry
which offers more employment opportunities to Tanzanians.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank chief made the remarks at a press conference
over the weekend in Arusha, northern Tanzania, after inspecting
some of the national agriculture and livestock research extension
projects (NALREP) in Arusha and Kilimanjaro regions.
</P>
<P>
He said the horticulture industry together with other private
enterprises could flourish more and boost Tanzanian economy if
the government ensures infrastructures like water, electricity,
transport facilities, banking systems, customs and import
documentations were well organised and tuned to the business.
</P>
<P>
"Unless you can generate very significant increases on
agricultural income, there are no other ways this country can
attack the issues of poverty", insisted the Worlk Bank chief.
</P>
<P>
He added if the agricultural sector succeeds, then there is
always a possibility of creating more employment opportunities
for the jobless.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank through NALREP program, which started in 1989,
supported agricultural extension services department by providing
extension officers with transports in terms of vehicles,
motorcycles, fuel and allowances to enable them teach the farmers
easily and offer technical advices.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Trade Increases, Surplus Declines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's total trade continued
to grow in the first quarter of this year while its balance of
payments surplus declined, according to the First Quarter 1996
Economic Survey of Singapore published today.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Trade and Industry said the volume of trade
rose by 17 percent compared with 16 percent in the last quarter of
1995.
</P>
<P>
In nominal terms, total trade reached 90 billion Singapore
dollars (about 64.29 billion US dollars), marking an increase of
16 percent compared with 14 percent in the previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
Also in nominal terms, imports grew by 18 percent, up from 16
percent in the foregoing quarter, while exports increased by 14
percent compared with 13 percent a quarter earlier, the ministry
said.
</P>
<P>
It said that non-oil domestic exports rose by 13 percent,
compared with 15 percent growth in the previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
Domestic exports of oil products, benefiting from strong
demands due to the severe winter in the Northern Hemisphere, rose
by 23 percent compared with 1.2 percent a quarter ago.
</P>
<P>
Re-exports rose by 14 percent from 12 percent in the last
quarter of 1995, the survey showed.
</P>
<P>
It said that the United States, the European Union, Malaysia,
Hong Kong and Japan accounted for 77 percent of Singapore's
non-oil domestic exports in the first quarter of the year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Singapore's balance of payments surplus declined to
1.8 billion Singapore dollars (about 1.29 billion US dollars),
compared with 2.2 billion Singapore dollars (about 1.57 billion US
dollars) in the last three months of 1995.
</P>
<P>
"This was partly due to a smaller current account surplus of
4.2 billion Singapore dollars (about three billion US dollars)
compared with 4.4 billion Singapore dollars (about 3.14 billion US
dollars) a quarter ago," the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
It also noted that a smaller outflow of 8.8 billion Singapore
dollars (about 6.29 billion US dollars) was recorded in the
capital account, reflecting a reversal in short term flows under
the monetary capital account.
</P>
<P>
The country saw a net monetary capital inflow of 1.1 billion
Singapore dollars (about 785.71 million US dollars) during the
quarter, in contrast to the net outflow of 1.6 billion Singapore
dollars (about 1.14 billion US dollars) in the preceding quarter,
the survey showed.

<HEADLINE> Economic Forum Opens in Jakarta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
opened a two-day high-level economic forum here today with a call
for foreign businessmen to become its partner by facing the
challenges and seizing the opportunities in the country's economic
development.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening of the "Indonesia Summit '96," Soeharto
said Indonesia will continue to forge closer trade relations with
other countries, intensify economic and business cooperation with
them and accept foreign capital investment with open arms.
</P>
<P>
"We are determined to see to it that our economy and industry
begin to carry weight on the global level, with a dependable
competitive edge and productivity," Soeharto said at the
Indonesian economic summit, which was co-organized by the
International Herald Tribune and Indonesia's Ministry of
Production and Distribution.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's economy had made remarkable progress in the past 25
years since its first five-year Development Plan was launched in
1969.
</P>
<P>
In 1969, Indonesia's per-capita income was only around 70 U.S.
dollars and in 1994, it jumped to approximately 920 U.S. dollars,
the president said.
</P>
<P>
He said Indonesia's strategy to accelerate development relies
on the maintenance of solid and dynamic national stability aimed
at ensuring the continuity of policies.
</P>
<P>
"Political stability, economic stability and sustainable
policies are fundamental prerequisites for the success and
continuity of development," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
In the next Long-Term Development Plan (1994-2119), Indonesia
will maintain a prudent macro-economic policy while increasing
foreign trade and investment, so as to ensure that its economy
continues to grow robustly and that more employment opportunities
are created, Soeharto said.
</P>
<P>
"Especially, we give a high priority to the development of
infrastructure, transportation, public works, telecommunication
and energy provision which are very important to sustaining our
industrialization process," he said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia, the president added, is also aware that the world
economy is still beset by uneven growth, disparities and the
continuous uncertain situation.
</P>
<P>
To overcome this situation, he said, member countries of ASEAN
(the Association of Southeast Asian Nations) have established
regional cooperation in the form of the ASEAN Free Trade Area
(AFTA).
</P>
<P>
AFTA has indeed been meant to maximally capitalize on the
positive impact of the economic globalization, he said. ASEAN has
brought forward the dateline for the fully operational AFTA from
the year 2008 to 2003.
</P>
<P>
He also spoke highly of the role of APEC (the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation forum) in the initiative towards
liberalization and facilitation of trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
About 250 senior government officials and 600 top
representatives of the business community from Indonesia and
foreign countries are attending the meeting. Chinese Vice Premier
Zhu Rongji, who arrived here yesterday, is to deliver an important
speech this afternoon at the meeting.

DHAKA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh has proposed a heavy
climate-protection tax on countries responsible for the
degradation of the global climate, which is jeopardizing the
existence of human beings and other life forms on this planet,
local reports said today.
</P>
<P>

on "Climate Change and Enhancement of Environmental Awareness"
organized by the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation

Yunus urged experts to consider imposing the heavy tax to
"remind all citizens of those countries of the consequences of
their consumption pattern and go a long away in saving the earth
from environmental calamity."
</P>
<P>
"We are all in a small spaceship called the earth" and "if one
of us damaged this spaceship, all would run the risk of getting
annihilated and one bad judgment by one leader in any of the
nations could bring all to the brink of total destruction," he
warned.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the need to mobilize politicians to help raise the
awareness of environmental pollution, said the reports.

SINGAPORE, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's economy is expected
to grow by 7.5-8.5 percent in 1996, a 0.5 percentage point higher
than the original forecast of 7-8 percent, the Ministry of Trade
and Industry said today.
</P>
<P>
"With the external environment remaining largely favorable,
growth for the Singapore economy should continue to be good," the
ministry said in releasing the Economy Survey for the first
quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
However, it was quick to add that the momentum could slow
towards the second half of the year.
</P>

"In view of these trends, the Ministry of Trade and Industry
revised the growth forecast for 1996 from 7-8 percent to 7.5-8.5
percent," said the ministry.
</P>
<P>
It said the strong economic growth of 10.7 percent achieved in
the first quarter was boosted by double-digit growth in
manufacturing, transport and communications and construction,
which were in turn spurred by buoyant regional growth and strong
global demands for electronic products.
</P>
<P>
As for business expectations for the next six months from April
to September, the ministry noted that industrialists were

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Probe Arms Allocation by Ex-Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi caretaker government
has ordered a thorough investigation into the allocation of fire
arms and issuing of their licenses during the rule of the former
government of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), sources said
today.
</P>
<P>
They said the Ministry of Home Affairs has ordered the relevant
agencies to look into the social status of the arms possessors,
misuse of licensed arms and source of income of the arms
possessors in the country.
</P>
<P>
On December 28, 1992, the then BNP government ordered a halt to
the issuance of new licenses on the ground of abuses of legal arms
by their possessors.
</P>
<P>
But according to the sources, the government later secretly
distributed 239 arms to some applicants under a special order.
</P>
<P>
The whereabouts of about 10,000 pieces of weapons issued during
the government of ex-president M. Ershad are not known either, the
sources added.
</P>
<P>
The country's former opposition parties led by the Awami
(People's) League have long accused the former BNP government of
abusing its power by hiding fire arms for the party's interest.
</P>
<P>
The BNP was forced to step down on March 30 this year, paving
the way for the present caretaker government led by M. Habibur
Rahman.
</P>
<P>
A fresh parliamentary election is scheduled for June 12.

Tianjin Vice-Mayor Ye Disheng said: "The Tianjin Port Bonded
Zone faces the possibility of faster development," and "Tianjin

DHAKA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi commercial banks suffered
a significant decline in deposits with the total amount falling by
more than 12 billion taka (about 300 million US dollars) in only
four months from the beginning of this year, official sources said
today.
</P>
<P>
They said the total deposits, including time and demand
liabilities, stood at 416.78 billion taka (10.42 billion US
dollars) at the end of December 1995 and dropped to 404.11 billion
taka (about 10.10 billion US dollars) by April 30 this year.
</P>
<P>
Officials have confirmed the decline, but could not specify the
cause of such a big decline in deposits, which normally grow by 10
percent annually.
</P>
<P>
The price hike of major essential commodities might have
prompted savers to withdraw their cash, the officials said, adding
that expenses for the country's two general elections in February
and June might have also played a part in the decline of deposits.

<P>
NAIROBI, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Construction of Kenya's third
international airport in Eldoret, western Kenya, will be
completed at the end of this year, the contractors have said.
</P>
<P>
The project manager of SNC- Lavalin Europe, Nicholas Maniais

<HEADLINE> Beijing to Further Extend Its Mobile Phone Web </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese capital is set to start
its largest expansion project in digital cellular telephone
network yet, the third since it began digital mobile phone service
in 1995, to meet the rapidly growing demand for mobile
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
The GSM expansion project will start next month and be
completed by the end of this year, increasing switching capacity
of the city's global service for mobile communications network by
150,000 lines to 250,000.
</P>
<P>
The project will use the latest digital micro-cellular
technology from Motorola, which can provide high subscriber
density, for conferences, and in office buildings and subway
tunnels, according to "People's Posts and Telecommunications
Daily".
</P>
<P>
A contract was signed by the city's telecom bureau and Motorola
and the Finnish telecom leader, Nokia, on May 2.
</P>
<P>
Ni Yilin, director of the bureau, said he hopes the two foreign
companies can supply more high-capacity cellular phones to the
city. The number of GSM subscribers in Beijing is expected to
exceed 700,000 by the year 2000, he said.

<HEADLINE> Sharp Rise in Mobile Phone Use in Chinese Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Beijing has seen a sharp increase
in imported mobile telecommunications equipment, which amounted
to 13.67 million US dollars' worth in the first quarter of this
year.
</P>
<P>
The figure is 98 times that of the same period last year. The
Chinese capital imported only two mobile telephones during the
first three months of last year.
</P>
<P>
European giants in mobile telecommunications, such as Ericsson
and Nokia, have gained the upper hand over their American
counterparts in this field.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter, the European companies accounted for as
much as 90 percent of imports to the capital. About 68 percent of
Beijing's 14,000 imported mobile telephones last year came from
Europe.
</P>
<P>
Local overseas-funded enterprises are some of the major
importers of mobile telecommunications equipment, which accounted
for half of the city's total imports in the first three months of
this year.

<HEADLINE> Rafsanjani Hails Iran-Turkmenistan Railway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MASHHED, IRAN, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Akbar
Hashemi Rafsanjani today highlighted the importance of a railway
from Iran to Turkmenistan, saying it will "revive the historical
Silk Road."
</P>
<P>
At the inauguration of the Mashhed-Sarakhs-Tajan railway,
Rafsanjani said the railway "will link the railway networks of
Asia and Europe from the coasts of Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic."
</P>
<P>
The railway is 295 kilometers long, including 165 kilometers in
the Iranian territory and 130 kilometers on the soil of
Turkmenistan. It links landlocked Central Asian republics with the
Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
At the inauguration ceremony at the Mashhed Station, the
Iranian president described the railway as a good example of
regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"I want to thank our friends in Turkmenistan, especially His
Excellency Mr. Saparmurat Niyatsov for his personal interest and
effort that ensured completion of the Tajan-Sarakhs segment of the
railroad in Turkmenistan on time," he said.
</P>
<P>
President of Turkmenistan Niyatsov, along with Rafsanjani and
10 other presidents from Afghanistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan,
Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrghyzstan, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkey and
Uzbekistan, attended the inauguration ceremony.
</P>
<P>
"Sustained and regionally coordinated economic growth and
development will consolidate peace and stability and pave the way
for enhancement of international relations," said Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
"Expansion of communications, roads and railway network, access
to world markets and mutually reinforced and beneficial relations
in the region can enhance amity, confidence and trust among
governments and lead to mutual understanding and greater
solidarity," he added.
</P>
<P>
The railway will allow the Central Asian countries and even
China to have further access to the Persian Gulf through Iran and
to the Mediterranean through Turkey.
</P>
<P>
In Iran, the railway is connected with the Bafgh-Bandar Abbas
railway, adding up to a total distance of 2,620 kilometers from
the Iranian-Turkmenistan border to the coast of the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Mahmoud Vaezi told Xinhua
Sunday that the railway will bring the countries in the region
closer politically, culturally and economically.

<HEADLINE> Things Looking Up for Backward Old Revolutionary Bases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Many of the 80 million
poverty-stricken people in China reportedly live in areas of old
revolutionary bases where great contributions were made during the
birth of the People's Republic of China - but things have been
getting better for farmers in these areas.
</P>
<P>
Although they have long lagged far behind the rest of the
country economically, in recent years, more investment has been
made to help develop the economy and train personnel.
</P>
<P>
According to a symposium of the China Society for Promoting
Construction of Former Revolutionary Base Areas, they have seen
much progress in poverty-relief work, and much assistance has been
provided to the areas. Last year more than 5,000 children of
martyrs were helped with one million yuan in assistance funds.
</P>
<P>
All the villages of the city of Lingyi in east China's Shandong
Province now have access to highways and electricity, and a state
assessment has shown that the city has largely got rid of poverty.
</P>
<P>
In Luohe City of central China's Henan Province, a massive
"Fumin" (making people rich) project brought a great increase in
farmers' income last year.
</P>
<P>
Farmers in Xuanhan, Wanyuan, and Quxian counties, in southwest
China's Sichuan Province, had an average of 627 yuan in income and
405 kg in per capita grain, by developing the breeding industry in
their areas.

<HEADLINE> Special Bus Trips in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The first urban tours of Shanghai,
China's largest metropolitan business center, may just signal a
change in people's idea about this city being only a shopping
center with little sight-seeing potential, a newspaper seen here
reported..
</P>
<P>
The new bus route, which became operational just a fortnight
ago, starts at Jinjiang Hotel, crosses People's Square, passes
Oriental Pearl Tower, the First Babaiban Store, goes across Nanpu
Bridge, Yuyuan, past the New Bund, and back to the hotel.
</P>
<P>
The buses run from 9 a.m to 9 p.m, at 30-minute intervals,
according to the paper "China Tourism News".
</P>
<P>
Tour guides on the buses are required to have a command of at
least two languages to point out prominent urban features along
the route, and provide quality service for passengers.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, travellers can buy the 18-yuan tickets
on the bus or at popular scenic spots and travel agencies. The
tickets stay in effect throughout the day of purchase, no matter
how often the travellers use them.
</P>
<P>
The effort was sponsored, as a test case, by the Jinjiang
Tourism Corporation Ltd. and the Friendship Auto Service Company
of the Jinjiang Group with the idea of better using Shanghai's
urban tourism resources.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: India Enters New Unstable Stage (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The fact that no political party
in India has won a clear majority in the 11th Lok Sabha (lower
house) general elections held from April 27 to May 7 signifies
that India has entered a new unstable stage.
</P>
<P>
India's Lok Sabha has 545 seats. Except the two seats that are
nominated by the president, 543 seats are decided by general
elections. In the first three rounds of elections, the Bharatiya
Janata party (BJP), the country's biggest opposition party,
secured 158 seats, ranking first in all the political parties, yet
it would need 100 more seats to achieve a working majority in the
parliament and to be in a position to form the next government.
The former ruling Congress party headed by P.V. Narasimha Rao
suffered a humiliating defeat in the elections by wining only 136
seats, the lowest in Indian history. The third political force in
the country, the combined force of the National Front-Left Front
(NF-LF), got a little more seats than it did in the 1991
elections, yet it is far from achieving a clear majority in the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Corruption and splits in the Rao government and the Congress
party are the main reasons for the Congress party's failure in the
elections. The party is going to hold meetings to summarize its
disappointing performances in the elections and formulate new
strategies on May 22. Defeated as it is, the Congress party will
play a crucial role in India's future politics as no party alone
is strong enough to rule the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Now the BJP and the NF-LF are
vying to woo small parties and independents as well as the
Congress party to form the next government. The Congress party has
already decided to support the NF-LF to form a secular government
so as to prevent the "communal party" of the BJP from entering the
central stage. The Congress's decision has dampened the spirits of
the BJP in its quest to assume the reins of power.
</P>
<P>
No matter which party with its allies comes to power, the new
government will be unstable, for the allies will not be able to
solve their inherent differences and disputes over various policy
issues. The Congress party wants to continue its economic reforms
started in 1991 when the Rao government came to power. The NF-LF
generally welcomes economic reforms for ending bureaucratic
controls and cutting red tape, but not by "introducing
liberalization, globalization and privatization that erode its
(India's) economic sovereignty and weaken its self-reliance". The
BJP prime ministerial candidate A.B. Vajpayee has said that a BJP
government would favor "self-reliance" and would "not allow the
multinationals any further entry into the consumer sector".
</P>
<P>
India witnessed two weak and short-lived coalition governments
in 1977 and 1989 and the next government is no exception. The new
government will face much bigger challenges ahead and is expected
to crumble at any time, politicians here said.
</P>
<P>
Such an unstable situation in the country will certainly affect
the country's economic reforms and its development, they added.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's Tourism Booms In First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Jordan received more than 223,000
tourists in the first quarter of this year, a sharp increase of
19.25 percent compared with over 187,000 tourists in the same
period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Tourism and Antiquities Saleh Irsheidat said Sunday
that the figure marks a record year after the sharp fall caused by
the 1990 Gulf crisis.
</P>
<P>
American and European tourists made up most of the foreign
visitors to the kingdom so far this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jordan was determined to intensify its tourist marketing
programs abroad, especially in the United States, Europe and the
Far East, in order to reach the goals of what he described as an
increase of 25 percent of tourist numbers in 1996 over 1995 and 1
billion U.S. dollars of tourism revenues this year, up from 700
million dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
Tourism, a main foreign currency earner for Jordan after
expatriate remittances and exports of potash and phosphates, has
shown the most tangible gains from the peace treaty it signed
with Israel in 1994 which ended the 46-year-old state of war
between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Economy Grows by 10.7 Percent in First </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's economy grew by a
strong 10.7 percent in the first quarter of this year, boosted by
double-digit increases in manufacturing, transport and
communications and construction, the Ministry of Trade and
Industry said today.
</P>
<P>
According to the First Quarter 1996 Economic Survey of
Singapore, the manufacturing sector grew by 15 percent, up from 12
percent recorded a quarter earlier.
</P>
<P>
The country's transport and communications increased by 10
percent in the period while the construction sector chalked up a
strong growth of 19 percent, compared with 11 percent the previous
quarter.
</P>
<P>
Growth in the manufacturing sector was led by the electronics
industry that enjoyed strong demands for disk drives, printed
circuit boards and other computer peripherals, said the ministry.
</P>
<P>
It added that growth in key non-electronics industries like
machinery and printing and publishing also benefited from stronger
demands.
</P>
<P>
The sector of transport and communications benefited from
greater demands for air transport services thanks to the festive
season, the Asian Aerospace Exhibition in February and sustained
growth in communications services, it said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry noted, however, that the growth of the country's
sea transport slowed down in line with the slower regional growth.
</P>
<P>
The strong growth of 19 percent scored in the construction
sector partly reflected the low base a year ago, said the
ministry.
</P>
<P>
But it attributed the fast growth in the residential segment,
both public and private, to the robust pipeline of projects as
well as a pick-up in activity since the second half of 1995 after
material shortages in the first quarter of that year.
</P>
<P>
The country's commerce sector rose by 9.2 percent in the period
while financial and business services grew by 8.2 percent, up from
the 7.4 percent in the previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
The ministry also noted that total demands for goods and
services increased by 15 percent in the first quarter of this
year, up from the 13 percent a quarter ago.
</P>
<P>
The external demands went up by 14 percent and the total
domestic demands by 19 percent, it said.

<HEADLINE> 2 Billion Dollars for China's Onshore Oil Exploration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 13 (Xinhua) -- China plans to use two billion US
dollars over the next five years for oil and gas exploration in
vast new areas where foreign oil companies will be invited to
participate, according to the China National Petroleum Corporation
(CNPC).
</P>
<P>
The exploration will be done in a group of new blocks in the
western part of the country and in the Songliao Plain of northeast
China. Foreign funds will be mainly sought for production of
undeveloped oil and gas reserves in areas around the ageing oil
fields in the eastern part of the country.
</P>
<P>
Gas exploration and cooperation will be sought for southwest
China's Sichuan Province and the Qaidam and Tarim basins in
northwest China.
</P>
<P>
The CNPC source said that China has expanded Sino-foreign
onshore oil cooperation to 21 provinces and autonomous regions,
covering a total area of nearly 2.5 million sq km.
</P>
<P>
CNPC has signed over 30 oil contracts and agreements worth 500
million U.S. dollars, on 150,000 sq km of land, with 28 of the
world's oil giants, and which have taken part in oil and gas
exploration in China.
</P>
<P>
China is taking an active part in overseas oil and gas
explorations and has got rights to oil fields in Peru, Russia,
Thailand, Canada, the Sudan, and Papua New Guinea. Initial
successes have already been made in some areas, the CNPC source
added.

<HEADLINE> Russia Against NATO Nuke Deployment in East Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Russia expressed today its strong
opposition against possible stationing of North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) nuclear weapons in central or eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
"Our negative attitude to the plans for NATO's eastward
expansion is well known," a senior Russian diplomat was quoted as
saying by an Interfax news agency report.
</P>
<P>
The Interfax filed the report from this Russian capital short
of giving the name of the Russian government official.
</P>
<P>
The remark was in response to the NATO chief's earlier
statement that eastern European countries wanting to join the NATO
would have to accept possible deployment of NATO nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana told a press conference in
Oslo, Norway, on Thursday that "countries wanting to join NATO
must go in as full members with all the obligations."
</P>
<P>
"The nuclear posture we have in NATO today should not be
changed and weakened when the alliance is enlarged," he said.
</P>
<P>
So far, countries including Poland and the three Baltic former
Soviet Union republics have expressed interest in joining the
western military alliance.
</P>
<P>
The unnamed Russian diplomat said that his country, while
against the NATO expansion, is "ready for reasonable compromises"
on the issue.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, "the statement of Solana, if it is conveyed
correctly, leaves this process without foundation."

<HEADLINE> 9 Bangladeshi Top Officials Resume Duty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Nine top officials in Bangladesh's
civil administration have resumed duties with the lifting of the
order of restrainment by the full court of the appellate division
of the supreme court.
</P>
<P>
Among the nine who rejoined their duties Sunday include Syed
Ahmed, the principal secretary to the chief adviser of the
caretaker government Habibur Rahman.
</P>
<P>
According to a petition filed by a journalist and supporter of
the former ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) on May 7, 20
top officials including the nine grossly violated the government
servants rules by joining the "people's podium" on March 25 to
engage in political activities.
</P>
<P>
The high court division of the supreme court took cognizance of
the activities of the 20 officials and issued show cause notice on
them for reply within 7 days, and at the same time suspended the
nine from their official duties for 10 days.

<HEADLINE> JLG Signs More Minutes On New Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 13 (Xinhua) -- China and Britain signed two more
agreed minutes here today on the New Airport being under
construction at the Chek Lap Kok, allowing more franchises for
aircraft services to go beyond 1997.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group (JLG) held
this morning, Zhao Jihua and Hugh Davies, senior representatives
of the two sides, signed two minutes to give a nod to franchises
for aircraft line and base maintenance and aircraft ramp handling
services, which will straddle the year of 1997.
</P>
<P>
So far the key franchises the Hong Kong Airport Authority has
negotiated with private bidders have had the blessing of the
Chinese side. The franchises are for aircraft catering, air cargo,
aviation fuel supply, aircraft maintenance and ramp handling.
</P>
<P>
The previous three franchises have been awarded to private
sectors after gaining an approval of the JLG in the middle and at
the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
At today's meeting, the two senior representatives reached a
common view after examining the six agreements on the mew
franchises, to be granted by the Airport Authority.
</P>
<P>
For the provision of aircraft line maintenance services, the
Airport Authority will sign two ten-year franchise agreements with
China Aircraft Services Limited and Pan Asia Pacific Aviation
Services Limited respectively, as well as a 20-year agreement with
Hong Kong Aircraft Engineering Company limited on provision of
aircraft line and base maintenance.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the franchise for aircraft ramp handling services,
three ten-year agreements will be signed with Hong Kong Airport
Services Limited, CLK Airport Ground Handling Limited and Ogden
Aviation (Hong Kong) Limited.
</P>
<P>
All these services will be put into operation in April 1998 to
facilitate the official opening of the New Airport.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side confirmed that the agreements will remain
valid, and be recognized and protected by the government of the
future Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) after June
30, 1997 in accordance with relevant provisions of the Memorandum
of Understanding Concerning the Construction of the New Airport in
Hong Kong and Related Questions.
</P>
<P>
After the singing of the agreed minutes, the Airport Authority
will be able to nail down agreements with franchises winners soon.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the Chinese side at the JLG said that the awarding
of the franchises will give a new push to the construction of main
supplementary projects at New Airport, thus further ensuring that
the airport goes into operation as scheduled in April 1998.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Reach Developed Nation Level in 2020 in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will emerge as a developed
nation in 2020 in terms of income with the annual per capita of
almost 12,000 US dollars, the same level as New Zealand now,
according to a study by the Thailand Development Research
Institute.
</P>
<P>
The country's per capita income stood at 2,425 US dollars last
year.
</P>
<P>
The study, which is available here today, predicted that the
income would grow by 7.01 percent from 1996 to 2000, 6.57 percent
from 2001 to 2010 and 6.36 percent from 2011 to 2020.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Thailand's population growth rate is expected to
slow down gradually from over one percent to 0.47 percent in 2020,
when the population is forecast to reach 70.5 million from the
present 60 million.
</P>
<P>
The study said there would be a drop in the number of young
people and a rise in the number of elderly, and there would be
fewer people in each family.
</P>
<P>
Poverty might continue to diminish in the country over the
years to come but it would not disappear altogether, said the
study. Thailand is now witnessing a wide gap between the rich and
the poor.
</P>
<P>
The study also serves a warning that more social problems would
arise, calling for closer attention to family relationships.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Present Action Plan to APEC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is ready to put forward
its action plan on four aspects of business before senior
officials of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum this
month, a source from the Thai Commerce Ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
The four areas are international standards, intellectual
property rights, easing travel regulations for businessmen and
dispute mediation, said the source.
</P>
<P>
But Thailand is keeping its options open until the last minute
to see whether other members also submit their plans to the May
22-25 meeting in Manila.
</P>
<P>
It has also prepared another 11 points for discussion at a
later meeting of senior officials.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has outlined a clear-cut program for adopting
international standards, which include those on industry set by
the International Organization on Standardization (ISO) and on
sanitary and phytosanitary requirements under the World Trade
Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
Stressing cooperation for improved protection of intellectual
property rights, the country plans to amend Patent and Trademark
Acts to comply with standards set for trade involving intellectual
property rights, said the source.
</P>
<P>
It is also drawing up laws to protect plant varieties, trade
secrets and integrated circuit designs.
</P>
<P>
The source said Thailand would work to improve administration
of intellectual property rights and promote the protection of
these rights in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)
and the Mekong River basin.
</P>
<P>
The country is planning multiple entry and re-entry visas for
businessmen, under an amendment to the Immigration Law now
awaiting cabinet and parliamentary approval.
</P>
<P>
According to the source, the proposed action plan would commit
Thailand to promoting consultations within APEC and arbitration
under the WTO to solve disputes between governments and between
private interests.
</P>
<P>
The country will move quickly to sign the International
Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between
governments and nationals of other countries.
</P>
<P>
It will also sign the Convention on the Recognition and
Enforcement of Foreign Arbitration (New York Convention), the
source said.
</P>
<P>
Each APEC member's action plan must state its commitments for
certain periods: 1997-2000 and 2001-2010 for developed members and
2011-2020 for developing economies.
</P>
<P>
The 11 points to be submitted for discussion later are tariffs,
non-tariff barriers, deregulation, multilateral investment,
customs procedure, government procurement, rules of origin,
services, competition, implementation of the Uruguay Round of
commitments under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(GATT), and collection and analysis of trade and investment data.
</P>
<P>
The source said all APEC members were likely to submit their
lists of items sensitive to tariff cuts and domestic politics to
other meetings of senior officials.
</P>
<P>
The source added that each member wanted to consider the
details of the plans presented by other members before final
consultations.

According to a Prensa Latina report, the official said Libya's
solidarity with Cuba has multiplied as a result of the recently
increased U.S. trade embargo against the Caribbean island.
</P>
<P>
The U.S government has been prohibiting, for 32 years so far,
U.S. citizens and business representatives from visiting or
carrying on financial transactions with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The sanction has been tightened up since March, when President
Bill Clinton signed a bill into law allowing legal suits against
other countries' trade relations with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
A similar bill targeting Libya is reportedly in the making at
U.S. Congress.
</P>
<P>
The Libyan Foreign Minister arrived here last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Since then, he has held talks with Cuban Foreign Minister
Roberto Robaina, Minister for Foreign Investments Ibrahim Ferradaz
and other top Cuban officials.
</P>
<P>
The minister said he favored increased cooperation between
Havana and Tripoli, and expressed Libya's interest in acquiring
Cuban sugar, coffee, tobacco, medicines and medical aid.

<HEADLINE> Singapore PM Visits Vietnam for Industrial Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok
Tong left here today for a two-day working visit to Ho Chi Minh
City of Vietnam for the ground-breaking ceremony of the
Vietnam-Singapore Industrial Park (VSIP).
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued today, the Prime Minister's Office said
Goh is scheduled to meet with his Vietnamese counterpart Vo Van
Kiet during his visit.
</P>
<P>
The ground-breaking ceremony of the VSIP will take place in
Song Be Province, about 20 kilometers from Ho Chi Minh City, in
the presence of the two prime ministers, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Launched in Singapore in January this year as its latest
regional flagship industrial park project, the VSIP was first
proposed by Goh when he made his first visit to Vietnam in March
1994.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the project will cover 100 hectares to be
completed in two years, which will cost about 52.5 million US
dollars. A further 400 hectares will be developed over another
six years at a cost of 156.5 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the VSIP project has the target of creating more
than 50,000 jobs and generating industrial output of more than one
billion US dollars for Song Be Province.
</P>
<P>
Singapore is currently Vietnam's largest trading partner and
its fifth largest foreign investor, with more than 100 projects
worth about 1.43 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister's Office said Goh is accompanied by Minister
of State for Trade and Industry Goh Chee Wee, other senior
government officials, businessmen and members of the VSIP
consortium.

<HEADLINE> Australia To Invest In China's Water Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The Australian Government is to
invest in the development of about 100 million Australian
dollar-worth of water projects in China through its investment
organization.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Industry Development Corporation (AIDC), an
investment company owned by the Commonwealth Government, has
raised 30 million US dollars to fund a Hong Kong-based joint
venture company, which will become one of the major investors in
China's water projects, the Australian newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
AIDC has 33 percent of stake in China Water, which is a joint
venture with Temasek Holdings Pte Ltd of Singapore and Hong Kong
Land from Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
China Water would raise about 100 million Australian dollars
(80 million US dollars) of funds to invest in Chinese water
projects, the newspaper reported. The headquarters of the company
is located in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
China Water's first project in China is expected to be
completed in 18 months. The fund for the joint venture with the
Shenyang Water Supply General Corporation in northeast China is
wholly provided by AIDC, worth 25 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
"The need for such facilities is great and it is believed that
China Water can make a significant contribution to the development
of China's infrastructure," AIDC investment Services executive
director James Turnbell said.
</P>
<P>
Abert Lai, managing director of China Water, said China would
need more than 230 new water plants in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
AIDC will eventually dilute its stake in China Water as the
joint venture broadens its shareholding.

<HEADLINE> Quicker First-Aid for Chinese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Central controls and more convenient
and efficient communication and transportation mean that emergency
medical services in China are a lot better.
</P>
<P>
All people in many big and middle-sized cities have to do is to
dial 120 to ask for emergency medical assistance. First-aid
centers have been set up in cities and all hospitals at or above
the county level, a recent conference of the Emergency Medical
Service Committee of the Chinese Medical Association was told.
</P>
<P>
Since the founding of the Emergency Medical Service Committee
nine years ago, emergency services have improved significantly
both in emergency room practice and in basic theory and
method. International contacts have grown as well.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Public Health decreed that all hospitals at or
above the county level must have emergency facilities, in 1983,
and decided to use that as a means of measuring a hospital's
quality of service.
</P>
<P>
As part of this modernization, in the east coast city of
Qingdao, doctors fixed it so that they can even operate aboard a
plane when necessary.
</P>
<P>
The Red Cross Society in east China's Jiangsu Province set up
first-aid clinics along major highways every five km, benefitting
local farmers and people who are on the move.

ROME, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Spaniard Conchita Martinez downed

<HEADLINE> Eight Sq M Living Space for Shanghai Residents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Cramped living quarters have
always been a headache for the local government and for the
residents of China's largest metropolis, but it's getting better
as living space for each urban resident has reached eight square
meters, from 1994's 7.5 sq m., official sources said.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest statistics released recently, last year
the city built 10 million sq m of residences for local people, an
annual increase of two million sq m.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, the city had 221 million sq m of living
space in urban areas, 11.93 million more than in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Of this, 55.26 million sq m were for distribution by government
housing administrations, 124 million by companies and
institutions, and 41.47 million were owned by private individuals.

<HEADLINE> OECD Urges NZ to Increase Overseas Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD) has urged New Zealand to boost
its overseas aid spending faster than planned.
</P>
<P>
The call was made at a meeting of the OECD Development
Assistance Committee (DAC) in Paris at the weekend, a New Zealand
Press Association (NZPA) report said today.
</P>
<P>
"The committee expressed the hope that the strong economic
growth New Zealand is presently enjoying would enable it to
increase its overseas development assistance volume faster than
presently envisaged," NZPA reported.
</P>
<P>
But the OECD noted that New Zealand's aid performance, which
had flagged for many years, had started to recover following its
successful economic reforms in the past 10 years and more.
</P>
<P>
"The DAC noted the intention of the New Zealand Government to
increase aid volume," the OECD said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the rise in the past two years, New Zealand's
assistance overseas accounted for only 0.24 percent of its gross
national product (GNP) in 1994, significantly below the 0.45
percent average for the DCA committee members, the OECD noted.
