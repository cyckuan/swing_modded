<HEADLINE> Chinese Film Wins Venice Film Festival's Golden Lion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 11 (Xinhua) -- "Not One Less," a film by
Chinese director Zhang Yimou, won the Golden Lion award at the
56th Venice film festival Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
Zhang, who won a Golden Lion seven years ago for the film "The
story of Qiu Ju," this time hit the mark with the story of a
13-year old school teacher in rural China who has to go and find a
missing pupil.
</P>
<P>
The film, which used real people instead of actors, was the
result of Zhang's long-cherished desire to make a film about
children in China's schools.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that all children can have a happy childhood," he said
as he received the award.
</P>
<P>
The Jury's special prize meanwhile went to "The Wind Will Carry
Us" (Le Vent Nous Emportera) by Iranian film-maker Abbas
Kiarostami, who also won an award in Cannes.
</P>
<P>
His film, like Zhang Yimou's, was set in a rural part of his
country and used local villagers in the cast. It revolves around a
group of people searching for something that is never made clear.
</P>
<P>
Giovanni Davide Maderna won the best first film prize for "This
is the Garden" (Questo e' il Giardino).
</P>
<P>
Britain's Jim Broadbent took best actor for his performance in
Mike Leigh's Topsy Turvy and France's Natalie Baye, co-star in "A
Pornographic Liaison" (Une Liaison Pornographique) was chosen as
best actress.

<HEADLINE> OPEC President Arrives in UAE for Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, September 11 (Xinhua) -- President of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) Youcef Yousfi
arrived here Saturday on a two-day visit to the United Arab
Emirates (UAE).
</P>
<P>
The visit is part of a tour of Gulf Arab oil-producing states
by the OPEC chief ahead of the group's upcoming ministerial
meeting in Vienna.
</P>
<P>
Yousfi, who is also Algeria's energy and mines minister, will
hold talks with UAE Minister of Petroleum and Mineral Resources
Obeid Bin Saif Al Nasir on a number of oil issues, notably the
continuation of OPEC's policy of output reduction that has been in
place since March.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the official WAM news agency, he expressed
the hope that the March output cut agreement would last until
March 2000.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, OPEC members and major oil producers
outside the organization cut output by 2.1 million barrels per
day.
</P>
<P>
"There is a significant improvement in oil prices following
compliance with the agreement, but I share the opinion of some
OPEC members that the world oil stockpile is still high and there
should be some balance," Yousfi said.
</P>
<P>
On reports that there had been proposals to establish both a
price and output ceilings, he said the issue was subject to the
approval of OPEC member states.

<HEADLINE> New Political Party Launched In Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 11 (Xinhua) -- A new political party, the
Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), was officially launched on
Saturday at Harare's Rufaro Stadium.
</P>
<P>
In his inaugural speech, Interim President of the MDC Gibson
Sibanda, who is also president of the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade
Unions (ZCTU), said time had come when people of Zimbabwe should
take charge of their lives and future through political change.
</P>
<P>
He said the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union (Patriotic
Front) (ZANU-PF) and its government had taken people for granted
for so long while turning a deaf ear to suggestions put to them by
the ZCTU and other groups representing the workers.
</P>
<P>
"We live in an economy that is not able to satisfy even the
basic needs of most Zimbabweans, where most people face a
continuous downward slide in job opportunities, income, food
security and well being. Business has collapsed and poverty has
grown," he said.
</P>
<P>
Among 15,000 people attending the rally were worker
representatives from all over the country.
</P>
<P>
Another MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai, who is also ZCTU
Secretary-General, said the MDC will give immediate priorities to
restoration of economic stability and growth, job creation, land
reform and building an accountable, transparent and open
government.

<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The four
decade-long civil war has caused huge personal and material
damages to Colombia.
</P>
<P>
The dynamiting of oil pipelines, the deforestation and
contamination with chemical herbicides applied to illicit
cultivations, and the presence of armed groups in protected
natural areas have turned nature into another victim of the
Colombian armed conflict.
</P>
<P>
A report of the Army News Agency published Saturday here says
that the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and the
National Liberation Army (ELN) guerrillas have dynamited more than
1,000 times the oil pipelines.
</P>
<P>
The Colombian Oil Company (ECOPETROL) has cleaned approximately
2,000 kilometers of rivers and 1,516 hectares of land affected by
oil spillages between 1986 and 1991.
</P>
<P>
But it has been almost impossible to recover the wildlife that
dies in oil pools, like fish and birds.
</P>
<P>
The document says that the attacks have caused several poor
zones of the country to miss receiving 900 million dollars.

<P>
PANAMA CITY, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Panama President Mireya
Moscoso will demand the United States to clean the firing ranges
during the visit she will make on September 23 to the U.N.
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The Panamanian president was quoted Saturday by local press as
saying that her government expects to meet with U.S. authorities
to discuss the areas contaminated with big quantities of
undetonated explosives, left by the U.S. Army.
</P>
<P>
Mireya Moscoso, who assumed the presidency of her country
September 1, said she will sit to talk with the U.S. authorities
like friends and ask them to honor the Torrijos-Carter Treaties,
signed by both countries in 1977 and clean those polygons, because
this is indispensable for the Panamanian citizens security.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Army created three firing ranges in the canal zone
during its permanence of almost one century, where the U.S. troops
left a big amount of undetonated explosives.
</P>
<P>
The United States troops have cleaned a big extension of the
polygons, leaving 3,175 hectares uncleaned, and they are not
willing to clean them alleging the difficult access to those
sites.
</P>
<P>
The undetonated explosives left in Panamanian territory are
indeed a big danger for the Panamanian citizens. So far, according
to official data, 21 Panamanians have been killed and many others
injured by the detonation of those artifacts.

<HEADLINE> Annan Sees Shift in Indonesia's Stance on Outside Help </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 11 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan said Saturday Indonesia seems to have softened its
position towards the proposed international help to improve the
security in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters here that he made the judgement based on what
the Indonesian military chief General Wiranto said and called it
an encouragement.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian Defense Minister was quoted as saying Saturday
that he saw a multi-national peace-keeping force as an option to
resolve the security problem in East Timor, the former Portuguese
colony annexed in 1976 by Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
He would report his idea to President B.J. Habibie for him to
consider, Wiranto said in Dili, East Timor capital where he was
accompanying a U.N. Security Council mission to visit the
territory.
</P>
<P>
But until Friday, Wiranto and other government officials had
insisted that it was not the right time for an international
force to land in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Annan said he will call Habibie Sunday morning to hear directly
from him what the Indonesian position is.
</P>
<P>
In the Security Council, an open debate was going on Saturday
while awaiting the report from the five-member council mission,
expected to return Monday.
</P>
<P>
Annan said Friday that "The time has clearly come" for
Indonesia to accept "without further delay" the international help
by a number of countries led by Australia.

<HEADLINE> Egypt to Continue Investigations into Lax Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Investigations into the lax
security allowing a man to attack and injure President Hosni
Mubarak Monday will extend into the highest levels of the security
apparatus, the Egyptian interior minister said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Investigations have been conducted into the lack of sufficient
awareness and quick response of the officers responsible for
securing the Mubarak's route, Habib el-Adli told an emergency
meeting of the parliament's Defense and National Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The security forces should have "suspected this person" and
taken the necessary steps to prevent their security cordon from
being penetrated, el-Adli was quoted as saying by Egypt's Middle
East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Said Hassan Soliman was shot dead by guards after
slightly wounding Mubarak with a knife when the president was
riding to a meeting in the Mediterranean port city of Port Said,
180 kilometers northeast of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
After the attack, Egypt's intelligence chief Lt. Gen. Hani
el-Azabi was dismissed and transferred to the post of border
security chief.
</P>
<P>
Three other top security officials in Port Said were also
transferred to new posts and were referred to a disciplinary
committee on charges of gross negligence.
</P>
<P>
If convicted by the disciplinary board, they could face
dismissal and revocation of pension and benefits.
</P>
<P>
Similar charges have also been leveled against another 14
officers of various ranks who failed in carrying out their duties,
el-Adli told the committee members.
</P>
<P>
He said the attack on Mubarak was "an individual act blamed on
a person suffering from mental disorder." The attacker "was
diagnosed four years ago as schizophrenic and mentally disorder."
</P>
<P>
There has been no information to show that the attacker has
affiliation with any outlawed group, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the daily Al-Ahram published Thursday,
Mubarak blamed the attack on lax security. He singled out the
three Port Said security heads, and said he will order security
reviews in all areas.

MOSCOW, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The number of carriers of HIV,
the virus that causes AIDS, soared by 70 percent in the first
eight months of this year in Russia, Health Minister Yuri
Shevchenko said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"Residents of Moscow and the Moscow region account for the

<HEADLINE> Two Suspects Arrested in Moscow Building Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Federal Security
Service (FSB) said Saturday that it had detained two suspects
following a blast in a Moscow apartment building that killed 94
people and injured more than 100 others.
</P>
<P>
Investigators are still trying to pinpoint the causes of the
blast that ripped through the nine-story building early Thursday
in southeast Moscow, although they have found traces of an
explosive often used by guerrilla groups at the site.
</P>
<P>
It was unclear whether the blast was a terrorist act or caused
by mishandling of illegally stored explosives.
</P>
<P>
The FSB, the successor to the Soviet KGB, said the suspects,
whose identity was not revealed, were being interviewed and would
stay in custody at least until Monday.
</P>
<P>
Police have been investigating a link between the blast and the
owners of a shop on the ground floor of the block.
</P>
<P>
Security officials have not ruled out a possible connection
between the blast and violence in the southern region of
Daghestan, where Russian troops are fighting Islamic rebels.
</P>
<P>
A car bomb explosion at a military apartment block in the
Daghestani town of Buinaksk killed 64 people last weekend. Three
suspects were detained in the blast believed to be staged by
Islamic militants.
</P>
<P>
On August 31, one woman died and dozens of people were injured
in a bomb blast at the Manezh shopping mall near the Kremlin. No
one claimed responsibility for that attack.

</P>
<P>
"Maybe it's high time they start deciding themselves as
Congolese rather than expecting other people all the time to come
in and say this must happen," she said, hinting at south africa's
growing impatience with the inability of the rival factions to end
their conflict.
</P>
<P>
Zuma has played a key role in making the Congolese Rally for
Democracy (RCD) rebels to sign a ceasefire deal after internal
rivalry delayed their endorsement of the accord for about six
weeks.
</P>
<P>
The two RCD factions are currently at odds over who should
represent the movement in the joint military commission which is
overseeing the ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
Leaders from both factions held separate talks with the South
African government last weekend.
</P>
<P>
Zuma said on Saturday South Africa used these discussions to
urge the two groups to settle their differences.
</P>
<P>
"We thought it could be a beginning for them as Congolese
deciding for themselves how they should be represented, and that
other people should only be brought in if they fail to resolve the
matter," she said, adding that "we are still waiting for them."
</P>
<P>
Asked if the two factions should not be seen as two different
movements, she said the RCD had signed the ceasefire as a single
entity.
</P>
<P>
"That is why there is now a problem with representation. The
RCD should tell us whether they are now one or two movements," she
said.
</P>
<P>
Zuma said South Africa was optimistic that the conflict in the
central African country would be resolved.
</P>
<P>
"I think people are committed. There is a goodwill, although
trust still has to be built."
</P>
<P>
She stressed that South Africa did not favor a particular
political grouping in the DRC, and would be prepared to hold talks
with any of the parties involved in peace process.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's involvement was aimed at enabling the Congolese
to determine their own fate through a process of national
political dialogue, she said.
</P>
<P>
"We must get the DRC to move away from being a country based on
ethnic rivalry because such an approach will not bring stability,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
The emphasis should be put on drawing up a framework or
constitution on how the DRC should be run, so that it became less
important who was running the country, Zuma said.
</P>
<P>
The RCD signed the ceasefire text on August 31 in Lusaka,
Zambia, adding their signatures to those of another rebel group
and the six countries that were involved in the year-long war.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, Namibia and Angola have been fighting on the side of
the DRC President Laurent Kabila against rebel forces intent on
toppling him.
</P>
<P>
The rebels received military backing from Rwanda and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The accord provides a ceasefire, the creation of a united army
after a 90-day dialogue on the DRC's political future, and
international peacekeepers to monitor compliance.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Vows to Reduce Illiteracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Education Minister Kader
Asmal Saturday pledged greater efforts to reduce illiteracy in
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Asmal said in a speech that a total of 3.2 million adult South
Africans did not have any schooling, while another 9.4 million did
not complete grade 9.
</P>
<P>
"Thus, 12.6 million or 54 percent of the total adult population
have not completed a general level of education," he told an adult
literacy awards ceremony in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
Budgetary constraints has resulted in several provincial
education departments cutting back or closing adult basic
education and training programs.
</P>
<P>
"This trend ought to be reversed, but it is improbable that the
 government will find sufficient additional funds in the near
future to eliminate illiteracy through formal programs run by
provincial education departments," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He called on businesses and other donors to help fund adult
literacy programs.

<HEADLINE> Russia's Chechnya Extends Emergency Rule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Chechen President Aslan
Maskhadov on Saturday issued a decree to extend the state of
emergency in the Russian republic, the Interfax news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
"I had to extend the emergency rule and announce a general
draft of all male adults," Interfax quoted Maskhadov as saying at
a press conference in Grozny, capital of the breakaway republic in
southern Russia.
</P>
<P>
The state of emergency, originally set at one-month, was last
declared on August 16, about one week after Chechen rebels sneaked
into Daghestan, another Russian republic bordering Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Russia's federal forces have since launched a campaign to root
out the Islamic militants and hinted at the time that military
strikes against the rebels could be extended to inside Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
After their defeat following a two-week federal campaign, the
rebels launched a second wave of attacks in another region of
Daghestan on September 5.
</P>
<P>
Federal military and interior forces are intensifying their
assault on the rebels in the past week. Chechnya repeatedly
accused the federal troops of bombing its territory, but Moscow
denied the accusations.
</P>
<P>
Maskhadov said he was taking "all possible and impossible
political steps to prevent a large-scale war and restore peace
around Chechnya and the region at large."
</P>
<P>
A meeting with Russian President Boris Yeltsin could become one
of these steps, Maskhadov said.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, shortly before the collapse of the Soviet Union,
Chechnya declared itself an independent state. The Russian
government refused to recognize Chechnya's independence, and in
December 1994 federal troops moved into the republic.
</P>
<P>
Fighting between federal and Chechen forces continued into
1996. In August of that year, Chechen rebel leaders signed a broad
agreement with the Russian government, bringing an end to the war.
</P>
<P>
The agreement called for the immediate withdrawal of Russian
forces and the postponement of a decision on Chechnya's political
status until December 2001.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese PM Praises Ties with Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 11 (Xinhua) -- On the eve of the visit by
Jordan's King Abdullah Bin Hussein to the country, Lebanese Prime
Minister Salim Hoss Saturday highly praised his country's ties
with the neighboring Arab country.
</P>
<P>
"His (Jordanian King) coming visit indicates good and brotherly
relationship which is linking Lebanon and Jordan," Hoss said in a
meeting with local guests.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the necessity to further strengthen the ties in
every field.
</P>
<P>
At the invitation of Lebanese President Emile Lahoud,
Abudullah is expected to make an official visit to Lebanon on
Monday, the first by a Hashemite monarch in three decades.
</P>
<P>
Lahoud will also pay a visit to Jordan in May, the first by a
Lebanese head of state in 25 years.
</P>
<P>
During his two-day visit, the king will hold talks with
Lahoud, Hoss and House Speaker Nabih Berri on bilateral ties and
regional affairs.
</P>
<P>
Ties between Jordan and Lebanon have been improving, especially
after Syrian President Hafez al-Assad attended the late King
Hussein's funeral in February and the new king made a visit to
Damascus in April.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has been following the foreign policy of Syria, a main
power broker which stations 35,000 troops in the country.
</P>
<P>
Ties between Jordan, Syria and Lebanon cooled after King
Hussein signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and Syria are technically still at war with Israel
which is occupying South Lebanon and Syria's Golan Heights.

<HEADLINE> Most Trade Unionist in UK Oppose Euro: Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Trade unionists in Britain are
not enthusiastic about early entry into the single currency,
according to a new opinion poll released Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The poll of 60 trade unionists conducted by the Transport and
General Workers showed 55 percent of trade union members were
opposed to the UK signing up to the euro.
</P>
<P>
Of those surveyed, 21 percent were strongly opposed and 34
percent were generally opposed although they said they could be
persuaded in favor if they thought it was good for the economy.
</P>
<P>
TGWU General Secretary Bill Morris said the survey lent support
to the government's current policy, saying "this poll clearly
shows there is no appetite for early entry."
</P>
<P>
"Any move to bounce the British public will be
counter-productive and could undermine the chances of a Yes vote
in a referendum," added Morris.
</P>
<P>
The issue of when Britain should join up to the single currency
is expected to be a key issue at next week's Trade Unions Congress
in Brighton.

<HEADLINE> Paraguay Lowers Level of Relations With Argentina </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Paraguayan Foreign
Minister Jose Felix Ferenandez said Saturday that relations
between his country and Argentina are "virtually frozen."
</P>
<P>
Fernandez told the press that he ordered Paraguayan ambassador
in Buenos Aires Leila Rachid to reduce contacts with Argentine
diplomatic authorities to a third level, according to reports
received from Asuncion.
</P>
<P>
The relations between Argentina and Paraguay became tense after
the Argentine authorities refused their Paraguayan counterparts to
extradite former general Lino Oviedo.
</P>
<P>
Fernandez said that the Paraguayan government rejected the
apologies presented by Argentine President Carlos Menem after the
recent incidents between both countries.
</P>
<P>
Paraguay recalled its ambassador in Buenos Aires Leila Rachid
after Argentina refused to extradite Oviedo, the alleged
behind-the-scenes backer of the murder to Paruguy's former
president Luis Maria Argana, father of the current Paraguyan
Defense Minister Nelson Argana.
</P>
<P>
Menem cancelled a meeting with Paraguayan President Luis
Gonzalez Macchi foreseen for last Thursday in the Argentine city
of Posadas.

<HEADLINE> Liberia Denies Attacking Guinea </HEADLINE>

<P>
LAGOS, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Liberia denied Saturday an
accusation by neighboring Guinea that its troops in the border
area had attacked into the Guinean side and killed nearly 30
villagers.
</P>
<P>
Guinean state radio said Friday that the Liberian soldiers
attacked three villages in its Macenta region Friday, burning a
number of houses before they were driven back by Guinean troops.
</P>
<P>
The radio said one Liberian soldier was captured.
</P>
<P>
But, a Liberian senior military official, who didn't want to be
named, said in its capital Monrovia that Guinea's accusation was
aimed at spreading misleading information, according to reports
reaching here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He said Liberia was not interested in war with its neighbors
but would defend its territory if attacked, adding that some
80,000 refugees were forced to flee fighting in the border region
last month, when armed insurgents believed to be Liberian
dissidents based in Guinea made assault in the Lofa county of
northern Liberia.
</P>
<P>
Liberia had accused Guinea of supporting the rebels, which was
rebuked by the Guinea's government.

<HEADLINE> S. Leonean Rebels Still Holding 1,000 Children: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Rebels in Sierra Leone are
still holding about 1,000 of the 4,000 children they abducted
during their invasion of the country's capital Freetown in January
this year, a United Nations official was quoted as saying on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Olara Otunnu, the U.N. special representative on children in
armed conflict, said that about 60 percent of the abducted
children were girls. Most of them were being sexually abused, the
Pan-African News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Otunnu, who returned from a six-day visit to Sierra Leone on
September 4, said that more than 10,000 children in the country
have been serving as child soldiers with the rebels and civil
militia.
</P>
<P>
In a 15-point agenda, he called for the establishment of a
national commission in the country to promote the rights and
welfare of children after the war.
</P>
<P>
Otunnu appealed to all political leaders in Sierra Leone to
demonstrate their commitment to implementing the peace accord
signed between the government and rebels of the Revolutionary
United Front in July.

<HEADLINE> Britain Suspends Military Sales to Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Britain is suspending all
military sales to Indonesia, Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"The British government will take national action to suspend
existing contracts, including the Hawk contract," Cook told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
Cook made the remarks just hours after defense ministry
officials said that the delivery of nine more Hawk jets to
Indonesia would go ahead despite the East Timor crisis.
</P>
<P>
"We are not embarrassed by this and we are in fact pleased that
we are now taking this action to make sure we bring home to the
Indonesian government and particularly its army the horror and the
disgust of the international community at what's being done in
East Timor," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He said that Britain would heed East Timor's "cry for freedom"
and was ready to take part if Indonesia agreed to let an
international peacekeeping force into that territory.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister added that Britain would "support an
European Union arms embargo" against Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The suspension of the delivery of the nine ground-attack Hawk
jets, under a 1980s deal signed by the Conservative government,
was regarded as a sudden U-turn of the Labor government.
</P>
<P>
Britain's arms sale to Jakarta was widely criticized recently
after hundreds of civilian Timorese were reported killed.
</P>
<P>
Jakarta is currently under considerable international pressure
to halt the massacres in East Timor carried out by
anti-independence militias angered by the territory's overwhelming
vote on August 30 in favor of ending Indonesian rule.

<P>
QUITO, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Ecuadoran President Jamil
Mahuad said Saturday that his government will practice austerity
and budget discipline to reactivate the economy of the country in
the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
One of the government goals will be to reduce inflation from
55-60 percent this year to 25-30 percent in search of a three
percent economic growth in 2000, said Mahuad during a week-end
speech.
</P>
<P>
The president said that the 14-billion-dollar Ecuadoran foreign
debt is "a very heavy burden for the country, so the financial
authorities are seeking an agreement with the international
creditors.
</P>
<P>
He said that the country obtained new credits from the
international banking institutions for 1.25 billion dollars, but
it is necessary for the country to fulfill its part of the deal
and the restruction of its tax system.
</P>
<P>
The president said it is necessary that the Congress will
approve before November 30 the increase to the value added tax
(VAT) of 10 to 15 percent and the government budget for the year
2000 for the equivalent of 4.4 billion dollars.

take a more courageous approach to business innovation.
</P>
<P>
According to Italian news agency Ansa, D'Alema told Italian
businessmen that the government was doing its part to boost Italian
economic growth but asked them to "give a more courageous push in the
direction of innovation in terms of products and services offered."
</P>
<P>
"Italy is starting along the right road in terms of development and
innovation, our aim is seeing through to its conclusion the challenge
of modernization," D'Alema continued.
</P>
<P>
Turning to employment issues, the premier said that the latest data
from the national statistics bureau Istat showed that 523,000 new jobs
had been created over the last three years.
</P>
<P>
He said that these jobs were termed "precarious" in the sense that
they did not involve a permanent contract, but he said that it was
wrong to view the employment issue in terms of permanent jobs only.
</P>
<P>
He said that greater job flexibility was a bonus and that the new
jobs were largely the result of measures introduced to increase this
flexibility.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema said that the underdeveloped southern half of Italy
required more infrastructure and services and that "a modern,
efficient state has the duty to remedy this."

<HEADLINE> LeBlanc Pleased With Choice of New Canadian Governor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Out-going Canadian Governor
General Romeo LeBlanc is pleased with the choice of Madame
Adrienne Clarkson as his successor.
</P>
<P>
"I think she's somebody that's pretty busy," LeBlanc said
Saturday, referring to the "energy she showed" at meetings with
universities and on other occasions.
</P>
<P>
"She will bring a whole new approach to it, which is what each
Governor General does," he made such comments after attending a
ceremony in memory of a historic war in Welland, Ontario.
</P>
<P>
Being Governor General of Canada is a hectic job in the highest
public office. During his term from 1995, LeBlanc has attended 1,
852 events and invited 68,677 guests to the Rideau Hall.
</P>
<P>
Local press said Clarkson's energy would no doubt help her cope
with what LeBlanc called a busy job.
</P>
<P>
Clarkson will take office on October 7, 1999 as Canada's 26th
Governor General, the second woman governor and the first one of
Chinese descent.
</P>
<P>
Clarkon, now 60, was born in Hong Kong in 1939. She came to
Canada as a refugee with her family during World War II in 1942.
She had served as Chairwoman of the Board of Trustees of the
Canadian Museum of Civilization in Hull, Quebec, until Wednesday's
announcement of her appointment by Prime Minister Jean Chretien.

<HEADLINE> Indian Scientist Challenges Big Bang With New Theory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 12 (Xinhua) -- A leading Indian astronomer
challenged Big Bang, the most accepted theory of universe
formation so far, with a new concept called Quasi Steady Cosmology
(QSSC).
</P>
<P>
Being developed by Jayant V. Narlikar, director of Inter
University Center for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA) based in
Pune, 1,400 kilometers south of here, along with British
Astronomer Fred Hoyle and two other IUCAA scientists, the theory
revolves around the idea of several mini-creation events instead
of one Big Bang.
</P>
<P>
Narlikar told the press here on Sunday that his new concept
could provide answers to some intriguing cosmological questions
whose answers based on the Big Bang theory were not satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
Though the idea was first proposed by Narlikar and Hoyle about
three decades ago, they are now using the theory to understand the
pattern of formation and growth of large structures like galaxies
and voids with modern computer simulation techniques.
</P>
<P>
According to the Big Bang theory, the universe was evolved from
a huge explosion. Unlike common explosions that start from a
definite center and spread out engulfing the surroundings, Big
Bang occurred simultaneously everywhere and before Big Bang, there
was no matter, energy and even time.
</P>
<P>
Though some experimental evidences did exist in support of the
theory, Narlikar said, it is yet to be accepted universally as it
fails to satisfactorily answer a fundamental question -- what
preceded Big Bang?
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the Indian astronomer said, matter was not created
from a single epoch-making event like Big Bang but evolved
continuously from an energy reservoir called "creation field."
</P>
<P>
According to his concept of QSSC, there was no beginning of the
universe as proposed by the Big Bang theory.
</P>
<P>
QSSC provides an alternative to explain cosmological features
described by the Big Bang theory including the formation of large
structures like galaxies and voids in a different way.
</P>
<P>
The model was tested by computer simulation and preliminary
results were "remarkable," Narlikar said, adding that, however, it
needs more fine-tuning.
</P>
<P>
Matter is created in the universe out of the creation field by
mini-bangs or mini-creation events, according to the QSSC theory,
but the rate of matter formation varies with time as the
mini-creations are not switched on continually.
</P>
<P>
Mini-bangs occur in the vicinity of compact massive objects,
each producing a local expansion of space which contributes to the
overall expansion of the universe.
</P>
<P>
At the same time there are phases where mini-creation events
are switched off and at this stage, expansion slows down only to
be accelerated after certain time.
</P>
<P>
The up-and-down creation activity helps maintain the overall
expansion of the universe, according to the new theory.

<HEADLINE> Britain Urges Fast Assembling of Peacekeepers into E.Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Britain on Sunday welcomed the
decision by Indonesian President B.J. Habibie to invite U.N.
peacekeepers into East Timor and urged the peacekeeping force to
be assembled quickly.
</P>
<P>
"We will now be looking for details of their commitment and for
their commitment to a U.N. peacekeeping force to be carried out
rapidly and in full," Robin Cook, Britain's Foreign Secretary,
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Cook said 250 British Army Nepalese Gurkhas, pledged by Britain
to the U.N. peacekeeping force, would be among the first
peacekeepers to arrive in East Timor, probably within days.
</P>
<P>
He said Sir Jeremy Greenstock, Britain's ambassador to the
United Nations, had spoken to Habibie, who promised that work
should start immediately at the U.N. headquarters in New York to
prepare the international force for East Timor.

<HEADLINE> Death Toll From Athens Earthquake Rises to 115 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The death toll from Tuesday's
earthquake in northwestern Athens rose to 115 Sunday as
aftershocks continued to hit the region.
</P>
<P>
Greece's Health Ministry said that it had so far registered 115
dead from Tuesday's earthquake registering 5.9 on the Richter
scale.
</P>
<P>
An aftershock measuring 4.2 on the Richter scale rocked Athens
at 9:17 a.m. Sunday, and seismologists said that the tremor was a
logical extension of Tuesday's powerful earthquake, which had an
epicenter in Mount Parnitha, some 20 kilometers northwest of
Athens.
</P>
<P>
It was rumored that a strong earthquake would hit Athens soon,
but the Athens Observatory described this as "groundless rumors,"
saying that aftershocks were being registered at wide intervals
and aftershock activity was developing normally.
</P>
<P>
The observatory said that aftershocks were expected to continue
for some weeks.
</P>
<P>
The state engineers have so far made 37,155 inspections. Fifty
percent of homes have been found suitable for habitation, 39
percent in need of repair, and 11 percent in need of demolition.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Greece has decided to establish a
commission made up of leading scientists and academics to examine
the reasons of why so many buildings collapsed in Tuesday's
earthquake, which is estimated to cost the country 100 billion
drachmas (about 333 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The commission will present a report to the Ministry of
Environment, Town Planning and Public Works by the end of this
month.
</P>
<P>
The Greek government has determined to bring those responsible
for the collapsed buildings to justice.

<HEADLINE> Top Two Play to Goalless Draw in Chinese Soccer League </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The much-touted top-of-the-
table Chinese first division soccer league clash between Liaoning
Fushun and Shandong Luneng turned out to be a goalless stalemate
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Hosts Liaoning Fushun maintained their grip of the top spot on
44 points from 23 round of matches, with Shandong Luneng three
points adrift placing second.
</P>
<P>
Defending champions Dalian Wanda, who have had a nightmare
season so far with a abysmal 6-9-8 record, edged themselves out of
the relegation zone with a hard-fought 1-1 tie with third-placed
Sichuan Quanxing. Wanda was now lingering at five places from the
bottom in the 14-strong first division league, which wraps up
until after three more rounds of matches.
</P>
<P>
In today's other matches, Shenzhen Ping'an nipped Jilin Aodong
1-0; Qingdao Hainiu was held to a goalless draw by Guangzhou
Songri; Shanghai Shenhua scored a convincing 3-1 win over bottom

<HEADLINE> African Countries Urged to Fight Against AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Africans have been urged to
spare no effort in deploying resources for the fight against AIDS
at the dawn of the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
Officially opening the 11th International Conference on AIDS
and STDS (sexually transmitted diseases) in Africa (ICASA) here on
Sunday, Zambian Vice-President Christon Tembo said, "we must bring
our accumulated experiences, expertise and resources to bear on
the challenge of responding more meaningfully and purposefully to
the HIV/AIDS pandemic, which now threatens the very existence of
humanity".
</P>
<P>
According to estimates, he said, HIV infections are highest on
the African continent. Many African countries, particularly those
of sub- Saharan Africa, are facing increasing, or at best steady
rates of HIV transmission.
</P>
<P>
For example, in most capital cities of the southern African
countries, it is not uncommon to find HIV infection levels in
excess of 20 percent of the adult population, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that the loss of youngsters in the prime of their lives
 is particularly devastating on Africa's economic development and
productivity in African countries.
</P>
<P>
"At the dawn of the new millennium, Africa must emerge on the
global arena with not only resolve to rise above conflicts and
civil war, but also start to build upon and strengthen practical
approaches to prevent the further spread of HIV/AIDS and to
mitigate its impact," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Themed "Looking into the future: Setting priorities for
HIV/AIDS/STDs in Africa", the week-long international conference
will examine the social and economic impact of HIV/AIDS in Africa
.
</P>
<P>
About 6,000 participants from 63 countries attended the
conference together with representatives from the United Nations,
the World Health Organization and some regional organizations.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Ministers Meeting Discusses Key Arab </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Iraq took over chairmanship of
the Arab League's biannual foreign ministers' meeting here Sunday,
stressing Arab unity against outside threats.
</P>
<P>
The meeting opened with delegates from 21 Arab states and
the Palestinian National Authority standing for a moment of
silence for King Hassan II of Morocco, who died in August.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day meeting, Arab foreign ministers and foreign
ministry officials are expected to discuss the United Nations
sanctions on Iraq and Libya and a call for an Arab summit to reach
a united position on peace talks between Arab countries and Israel.
</P>
<P>
The outgoing chairman, Somali ambassador to the league Abdullah
Mahmoud, welcomed the election of Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak as a step toward peace.
</P>
<P>
Mahmoud also referred to the United States-British airstrikes
against Iraq as an example of hostility against the Arab
world. Not condemning the attacks, he said they target civilians
more than the Iraqi military.
</P>
<P>
For the first time since it invaded Kuwait in 1990, Iraq took
over the chair according to the league's rotation of the seat
among member countries.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf said the
league's priority was Arab unity. He said he favored an Arab
summit, or a meeting at a lower level, as a response to the U.S
imposition of hegemony on the region.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech, Arab League Secretary-General Esmat
Abdel-Meguid called on the U.N. Security Council to lift sanctions
on Libya over the 1988 Lockerbie bombing, since Tripoli had handed
over the two Libyans suspected of blowing up a Pan Am airliner in
Lockerbie, Scotland.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, who received a standing
ovation on entering the meeting, emphasized that the 3 million
Palestinian refugees have the right to return to the
territories. He dismissed reports that the large number of
Palestinians in Lebanon might become permanent residents.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said he hoped the revised Wye accord signed on September
5 would be a new beginning for peace negotiations between Syria,
Lebanon, the Palestinians and Israel. He also stressed the
importance of East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"There can be no peace without Jerusalem, free (of Israeli
occupation) and as the capital of a Palestinian state," he said.
</P>
<P>
Among the other 46 points on the agenda are a proposal for a
united Arab airline and a call by the Palestinians and the United
Arab Emirates (UAE) to ban Arab participation in an upcoming
Israeli exhibit at Disney's Epcot Center in Florida, U.S..
</P>
<P>
The exhibit reportedly depicts Jerusalem as the capital of
Israel. The UAE has said it will boycott all Disney products if
the exhibit opens.

ISLAMABAD, September 12 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Special Rapporteur for
Violence Against women Radhika Coomaraswami Sunday criticized
Afghanistan's ruling Taliban for "systematic violations" of the
human rights of women.
</P>
<P>
"We found widespread violations of the human rights of women in
the Taliban areas of Afghanistan," Coomaraswami told a news

</P>
<P>
She said she and her team found violations of women's physical
security, the right to education, health, employment and movement
freedom.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban's Ministry of Vice and Virtue has authored edicts
that ban women from working and going to school, force them to
wear the all-encompassing burqua and order people to paint their
first-floor windows black so passers-by could not see women
inside.
</P>
<P>
Afghan women are also prohibited from traveling outside their
home without the company of a close male relative. Violators are
publicly beaten, Coomaraswami said.
</P>
<P>
She said discrimination against women exists throughout the
world but in Afghanistan it is the official policy of the Taliban.
</P>

The ruling militia has imposed its own interpretation of
Islamic law in the areas which account for more than 80 percent of
the war-ravaged country.

Jiang Zemin, sought Saturday to end the chill in the U.S.-China
relations with an hour of face-to-face conversation in Auckland,
New Zealand.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Accepts Peacekeeping Force to E. Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J.
Habibie announced here Sunday that his government accepted a
U.N.-sponsored international peacekeeping force in cooperation
with the country's military to restore order and security in East
Timor.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a televised speech at the presidential palace
Sunday evening, the president stressed the importance of bringing
peace to the violence-torn territory.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that since the imposition of martial law in East
Timor, the Indonesian military was reported to be still facing
some limits, which he said are much attributable to psychological
difficulties, thus hampering the security forces to take steps
toward creating stability in the territory.
</P>
<P>
It was said Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas will go to
New York Sunday night to discuss the arrangement for the sending
of a U.N. peacekeeping force to East Timor.
</P>
<P>
The discussion will be on which countries will join the
peacekeeping force and who will finance the U.N. actions in East
Timor.
</P>
<P>
Violence has taken place since the announcement of the August
30 ballot result in East Timor by the United Nations on September
4, which showed that over 78 percent of the East Timorese voters
cast their votes for independence.
</P>
<P>
Although the Indonesian military declared a status of emergency
in East Timor on September 7, the violence has not been stopped
completely. Reports said more than 100 people have been killed and
tens of thousands of houses have been burned down during the
violence.
</P>
<P>
In the face of the situation, the United Nations and some
western countries have called on the Indonesian government to
invite international forces to East Timor for the restoration of
security and order in the territory.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement signed with the United Nations in May,
Indonesia is responsible for security and order in East Timor
before and after the ballot.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, was integrated into
Indonesia in 1976, but the move has never been recognized by the
United Nations.

<P>
XIAMEN, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The new government foreign
investment policies China made known over the weekend show that
the country has made its most significant economic readjustment in
recent years to help sustain economic development.
</P>
<P>
At the Third China Investment and Trade Fair in Xiamen, Fujian
Province, which ended today, China announced that the country
plans to open its service trade to overseas investors and
encourage them to engage in technical development, invest in the
central and western parts of China, and improve the management and
services of foreign-funded enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Ma Xiuhong, assistant minister of foreign trade and economic
cooperation, said that the goal of the new policies is to adjust
the country's industrial structure and promote coordinated
development in different regions.
</P>
<P>
Since China opened to the outside world two decades ago,
economic growth has been affected by developments in other
countries, according to a State Development Planning Commission
report.
</P>
<P>
It said the Asian financial crisis and the global retrenchment
of 1997 had a strong impact on China's economy and caused great
difficulties in its macro-economic operations, resulting in a drop
in both the number of new foreign-funded enterprises and the
amount of contracted and paid-in foreign investment from January
to July this year.
</P>
<P>
Chinese analysts say that it is not enough to stop the economic
retrenchment by expanding domestic demand and that a changed
export-oriented strategy is the real answer.
</P>
<P>
At the just-concluded investment and trade fair, senior Chinese
officials said that China should choose outside resources suitable
for its development and change the policy from "imbalanced
development" to "balanced development".

China has announced that more areas will be chosen for
experiment to attract foreign investment in the fields of finance,
insurance, foreign trade, commerce and telecommunications, as well
as accounting, assessing and legal services.
</P>
<P>
This is seen by many as a breakthrough China has made in
opening to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
Hu Angang, of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said that
foreign-funded enterprises have provided 18 million jobs for the
Chinese, mostly in manufacturing, and if China opens the service
trade market to other countries, more jobs will be created.
</P>
<P>
State Councilor Wu Yi expressed the hope that foreigners will
invest more in central and western parts of China, just as they
did in the coastal areas a decade or more ago.
</P>
<P>
Central and western parts of China have 60 percent of the
population but only 12 percent of the foreign investment that has
flowed into the country so far. It is obvious that only by
encouraging investment in these areas, can China's goal of
developing in an all-round way be reached.
</P>
<P>
Promoting industrial improvements will be central task for
future economic growth, Wu said. At the fair many regions offered
overseas investors with opportunities in the fields of mobile
communication, automobile manufacturing, building materials,
electricity production and sensitive materials.
</P>
<P>
Wu Yi said that China is trying to become an assembly,
manufacturing and sales center for multinationals, and what is
more important is to make the country a technological development
center for these business giants.

<HEADLINE> China to Take New Measures to Encourage Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, September 12 (Xinhua) -- China is to take more measures
to encourage exports, according to Wen Zaixing, a spokesman for
the Third China Investment and Trade Fair which ended here today.
</P>
<P>
China's exports this year are still stuck with negative growth
so the Chinese government will adopt a series of new measures,
like reducing the amount of red tape and fees, Wen told
participants here today.
</P>
<P>
In recent months, the government has unveiled measures aimed at
promoting foreign trade and economic cooperation. On July 1, China
raised its overall rebate rate for exports by 2.95 percentage
points to about 15 percent and is considering more favorable tax
breaks for high-tech exports.
</P>
<P>
On the financial front, the People's Bank of China, the central
bank, and the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation
published a notice on closed-end loans to foreign trade businesses
and China shortened its list of export quotas and decreased the
number of restrictions on businesses that want to get involved in
foreign trade and economic cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Importance of Legal System in Family Planning Emphasized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YICHANG, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese family planning
workers today stressed it is very important to recognize the role
of a legal system in family planning and to act in accordance with
the law in supervising family planning.
</P>
<P>
This is closely connected with the country's population control
strategy for the 21 century, according to participants in a
meeting on strengthening the role of a legal system in family
planning held here today.
</P>
<P>
Since 1990, the State Family Planning Commission has had more
than 20 rules and regulations on family planning and all provinces,
municipalities, and autonomous regions, except for Xinjiang and
Tibet, have local laws.
</P>
<P>
More Chinese are willing to abide by the family planning laws
and regulations and have also learned how to resort to the law to
protect their rights and interests.
</P>
<P>
Yang Kuifu, Vice-Minister of the State Family Planning
Commission, said that the country's family planning laws are far
from perfect and that there are serious infringements of people's
rights.
</P>
<P>
Provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions need more
concrete measures to get people to act in accordance with the laws
and to build a legal system for family planning.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the commission has proposed that the
framework of a national legal system on family planning be
initially built by the year 2005 and be basically perfected by
2015.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian President Describes Military Rule In New </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun
Obasanjo depicts the tragedy of military rule and gives his
reflection upon the country's modern history in a book published
Saturday titled This Animal Called Man.
</P>
<P>
A bad military administration such as that experienced by the
nation "is worse than a raging, uncontrollable mob and an armed
robber", said the president in the book, written when he was in
prison of former military regime several years ago, reported the
Guardian, a leading Nigerian newspaper Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo particularly lamented the destructive character of the
military in governance and its ethics. The soldier in politics, he
emphasized, " destroys and kills and guards himself with his
arms."
</P>
<P>
Although Obasanjo himself was not present at Saturday's book
launch at the Nigerian Institute of International Affairs (NIIA),
he was ably represented by his daughter, Busola Obasanjo. The book
was an aggregation of the President's thinking while serving a
15-year jail sentence for trumped-up treason charges initiated by
the Late Gen. Sani Abacha.
</P>
<P>
If initially on the Nigeria political scene, the military had
good and patriotic intentions, they were quickly supplanted and
over-ridden by sectional loyalties and tendencies and later
replaced by diversions of national resources to their families,
relatives, hatchet men and women and accomplices in crimes and
sins, said the president in his new book.
</P>
<P>
"Whatever good that has been achieved in the political,
economic or social sphere by all past post-independence
governments - civilian and military - have almost been wiped out
in the past fifteen years of the 20th century by the two
destructive military administrations who, no matter how much they
try to cover up, will have posterity record and present objective
accounts of their misrule and I hope they, their families and
accomplices will be in a position to read such accounts and
records," he continued.
</P>
<P>
Many dignitaries present on the occasion praised Obasanjo for
his courage and inspiration to put the book together even as a
prisoner.
</P>
<P>
Alhaji Ahmed Joda, former chairman of Peugeot Nigeria Limited
who presided over the public presentation of the book, described
Obasanjo as the best person that can lead Nigeria today.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Calls for Int'l Help in Population Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Health Minister Tim
Menakaya has urged international agencies to assist the country to
curb its fast growing population and to implement its poverty
alleviation strategies.
</P>
<P>
At Saturday's inauguration ceremony of a fund generation
committee of the Population Activities Fund (PAF) which took place
in Abuja, Menakaya stressed that with the current annual growth
rate of 2.83 percent, the population is expected to reach 235.6
million by the year 2025.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian, a leading Nigerian newspaper, Sunday quoted him
as saying " Nigeria, with an estimated population of 110 million,
is the most populous country in Africa and among the thirteen
poorest countries in the world. The Federal Ministry of Health
will implement key strategies which include fertility reduction,
maternal and child survival, improvement in the status of women,
creation of awareness on need for small family size and poverty
alleviation."
</P>
<P>
Lamenting the discouraging flow of financial assistance from
international donor agencies, the minister said, "the Official
Development Assistance declined from $61 billion in 1992 to 47.6
billion U.S. dollars in 1997."

<HEADLINE> Singapore to Participate in Peacekeeping in E. Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's acting Prime
Minister Lee Hsien Loong said his country has affirmed its
readiness to participate in a peacekeeping force in East Timor,
Television Corporation of Singapore (TCS) reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at Singapore's largest-ever sea carnival
organized by the Aong Mo Kio-Cheng San Community Development
Council, Lee said however that it is now premature for Singapore
to decide how to materialize the participation.
</P>
<P>
He noted that it is yet to be confirmed if there will be a
peacekeeping force in East Timor, where violence broke out after a
majority of voters chose independence for the former Portuguese
territory in a U.N.-organized direct ballot last month, TCS added.
</P>
<P>
"How we do it, what we do, the form of it, we will have to
study. But if it is part of a collective effort we have to do our
part," Lee was quoted as saying.

<HEADLINE> Western China Appeals to Overseas Investors (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Signs at the 3rd China
Investment and Trade Fair suggest that China's policy of shifting
its economic emphasis to the central and western parts of the
country has made great impact on overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
In the first three days of the China Investment and Trade Fair
which closed today in Xiamen in southeast China's coastal province
of Fujian, 19 provinces and cities in the central and western
parts of China have concluded 252 contracts involving a total
investment of 1.25 billion U.S. dollars, 32 percent of the fair's
total trade volume.
</P>
<P>
Some 780 million U.S. dollars, or 26 percent of the contracted
funds, will come from abroad, said an official of the organizing
committee.
</P>
<P>
Compared with provinces in China's eastern part, the central
and western parts have been slow in economic growth as a result of
unfavorable geographical conditions, lack of funds and other
factors.
</P>
<P>
By 1997, The number of overseas-funded enterprises and the
amount of investment which had been used in the central and
western parts of China made up only 17.2 and 12.5 percent of the
country's total respectively.
</P>
<P>
Facts show that there exists a serious imbalance in regional
economic growth with the emphasis laying too much on coastal areas
in the eastern part.
</P>
<P>
In recent year, China has gradually shifted its center of
economic development to the central and western parts to
accelerate development of the resources-rich regions, attain
common prosperity and ensure China's sustainable economic growth
as a whole.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation (MOFTEC) announced at the Second China Investment and
Trade Fair held last year that the central government would grant
the central and western parts a more preferential policy on the
use of overseas funds to encourage more overseas investors to come
to the region.

Historical records say that the Qiang were one of the most
powerful ethnic groups in China and had many dynasties that ruled
a large number of people and vast lands. But over the centuries,
they were pushed back farther and farther into mountainous parts
of in southern China.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, their numbers had shrunk to fewer than 40,000 by
1949, when the People's Republic was founded. But the figure
became 200,000 in the past five decades thanks to the government's
ethnic minority policies.
</P>
<P>
The Qiang learned from history that they would lose all
opportunity for development if they did not make the outside world
more accessible, and building roads was the only way.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, they have spent every cent on roads, according
to Xie Shixu, a government official in Maoxian County, southwest
China's Sichuan Province, where half of the 200,000 Qiang people
live.
</P>
<P>
One of the people who played a key role was Yang Songying, a
Qiang woman who is a deputy to the National People's Congress. She
and other villagers from Tongxinba village worked for three years
on a 3.5 km road and made the village a model of road building.
</P>
<P>
Neighboring villages have followed their example and a road
network has formed in the mountainous county. Visitors marvel at
the quality of the mountain roads in the area, but what may really
surprise them is the cost: about a tenth that of roads built in
developed areas of the country.
</P>
<P>
While both the central and local government financed the road
projects, the locals in Maoxian county also contributed in both
financial resources and free labor service. Meng Fei, a Qiang poet,
says that the impoverished Qiang built roads with their blood. He'
s referring to the six construction workers who died in a work-
related accident.
</P>
<P>
The roads have linked the Qiang with the outside world and
increased the flow of materials, cash, and people, which has led
to the growth of industries, including tourism.
</P>
<P>
The Qiang used to look down on business people and were
reluctant to contact outsiders, but this way of thinking has
changed, and shops, restaurants, and hotels have appeared, with
visitors from other parts of the country and abroad coming in.
</P>
<P>
Yan Yiqing, the owner of a summer resort and the richest
private businessman in Maoxian, says that his forefathers lived in
isolation and were shy about dealing with strangers. But, young
people now travel on business and talk with clients over the phone
or via fax or the Internet. What a change, he says.

<HEADLINE> Samaranch Backs up South Africa as World Cup Hosts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 12 (Xinhua) -- International Olympic
Committee president Juan Antonio Samaranch Sunday gave his backing
to South Africa who is bidding for the 2006 soccer World Cup.
</P>
<P>
Samaranch said the on-going All African Games, of which South
Africa are the host nation, will showcase the country's abilities
to hold big events.
</P>
<P>
"I think it's the view that you can organise very important
sporting events...the success of these All Africa Games can also
be very useful for the next bid from South Africa," he said.
</P>
<P>
Samaranch spoke after touring the athletes' village in
Johannesburg. He also said the games were "going very well".
</P>
<P>
The 11-day games are the continent's biggest sporting showpiece,
attracting some 5,000 athletes from 50 countries. It is the
biggest sporting event in South Africa since the 1995 rugby World
Cup.
</P>
<P>
Germany, England, Morocco and Brazil are also in the race to

<HEADLINE> Western China Appeals to Foreign Investors (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ma Xiuhong, assistant minister of the MOFTEC, announced a
series of new preferential policies to further encourage overseas
investment in the central and western parts including relaxation
of restrictions on overseas investors in joint ventures in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Taking advantage of this golden opportunity, provinces in
central and western parts of China have sent large delegations to
the current trade fair. Of the 18 press conferences given by the
organizing committee, 14 were hosted by provinces in the region.
</P>
<P>
Qinghai Province has provided overseas investors with 220
projects. Ningxia hui Autonomous Region invites overseas companies
to invest in agricultural, energy, communications and chemical
product development.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors acknowledged their identical stance that
there is a great prospect in the development of central and
western parts of China. Capital cities, coastal cities, economic
development zones and state-listed high-tech development zones in
the region not only enjoy the same preferential treatments the
central government grants to coastal provinces, but also possess
many superiority in the development of agriculture, mineral
resources, tourism and raw materials compared with the former.
</P>
<P>
State Councilor Wu Yi promised big gains to overseas investors
so long as they invest in projects which can fully tap local
natural resources.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, the central and western parts
of China have been regions of the fastest development in recent
years. When national use of overseas investment in China dropped
in the first half of this year, investment in central part grew 7.
04 percent while that in the western part registered a 15.86
percent rise.
</P>
<P>
Chinese economists stated that many overseas companies would
move their funds and production bases to the central and western
parts in the near future as the labor force, raw materials and
production costs in coastal areas are spiraling.

<P>
YAN'AN, SHAANXI, China, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Hosts Xi'an
halved the first four judo titles at stake while Hong Kong Tai
Kwong Yee was eliminated in the opening round of the fourth
Chinese City Games here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Fuyan took the men's 66-kg category judo title while his
women teammate Zhao Shunxin triumphed in the 48-kg class, as
applauses echoed in the full-packed Yan'an Sports Stadium.
</P>
<P>
Tai Kwong Yee, a 19-year-old Hong Kong player, failed to
advance further as he was stopped in the opener although his coach
Li Hung had hoped him to reap the men's 66-kg title as he was the
only Hong Kong male player present at the Games.
</P>
<P>
"I was really nervous in the competitions, but I also had to
acknowledge the fact that many a judo players here are of high
quality," said the Hong Kong player, a company salesman.
</P>
<P>
"His teammate Cheng Wai Yee, the only woman judoka from Hong
Kong, had recorded the game from the stands, and we will study the
video tape once we back to Hong Kong," said coach Li.
</P>
<P>
Yan'an, the holy land of China, was one of the four co-costs
for the City Games, which was being held for the first time in
China's northwestern region.
</P>
<P>
"A lot of changes have impressed me deeply and Yan'an leaves me
a great impression that people here are becoming open-minded more
and more," said the 43-year-old Hong Kong coach.
</P>
<P>
To host the City Games, Shaanxi provincial government has
invested nearly one billion yuans (some 102 million US dollars)

<HEADLINE> Track Coach Ma Misses Top Runners in City Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, China, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Famous track coach Ma
Junren arrived here this afternoon for the fourth Chinese City
Games without his top two women runners.
</P>
<P>
The absentees are Jiang Bo who missed the July trials and Dong
Yanmei who had a poor show in the trials in Shenyang, Liaoning
province.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Bo broke the 5,000-meter world junior record in the
previous City Games in 1995 while Dong Yanmei clocked a new world
record of 14:29.82 in the women's 5,000-meters in the 1997 Chinese
National Games.
</P>
<P>
With the absence of these two women runners, Lan Lixin, the 1,
500-meter world junior champion who clocked 4:10.05 in France in
July, 1998, becomes the gold medal favorite in the track
competitions to be started on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Ma's disciples will unveil a full-fledged battle in
the women's 800m, 1,500m, 5,000m and 10,000m track finals, as well
as in the field events of men's high jump and both men's and women
's hurdles.
</P>
<P>
Ma Junren stole the limelight in the world track arena in 1993
when his women disciples took titles in the 1993 world
championships in Stuttgart, Germany with two games records.
</P>
<P>
In September, 1993, three world records were created by his
women runners, including Wang Junxia and Qu Yunxia, in the 1,500m,
3,000m and 10,000m races at the seventh Chinese National Games in
Beijing.

<HEADLINE> Arab FM Meeting Opens Under Iraq's Chairmanship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Arab foreign ministers kicked
off their bi-annual meeting in Cairo on Sunday with Iraq in the
chair for the first time since its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers and foreign ministry officials from 21 Arab
states and the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) are expected
to discuss the U.N. sanctions on Iraq and a call for an Arab
summit to reach a united position on peace talks between Arab
countries and Israel.
</P>
<P>
PNA President Yasser Arafat will likely brief participants on
the revised Wye accord signed September 5, under which the
Palestinians and Israel planned to draw up a framework for final
peace talks by February 15 and complete the process by September
2000.
</P>
<P>
Among the other 46 points on the agenda are a proposal for a
united Arab airline and a call by the PNA and the United Arab
Emirates (UAE) to ban Arab participation in an upcoming Israeli
exhibit at Disney's Epcot Center in Florida, the United States.
</P>
<P>
The exhibit reportedly depicts Jerusalem as the capital of
Israel. The UAE has already announced it will boycott all Disney
products if the exhibit opens.
</P>
<P>
Regardless of the agenda issues, all eyes are on Iraqi Foreign
Minister Mohammad Said al-Sahaf, who took the chair on an
alphabetical rotation basis among member states. At the last Arab
foreign ministers' meeting in January, al-Sahaf stormed out in a
fury over his colleagues' failure to condemn U.N. sanctions and
the U.S.-British airstrikes on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Arab League Secretary General Esmat Abdel-Meguid has urged
al-Sahaf to use the chair to pursue reconciliation. On several
occasions after he arrived here on Friday, al-Sahaf said Iraq
supports all initiatives aimed at restoring Arab unity, which was
jeopardized by Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait prompted U.N. economic sanctions,
which will not be lifted until it is verified that Iraq has
eliminated its weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain launched four-day airstrikes in December
against Iraq in retaliation for what the Western allies denounced
as Baghdad's failure to comply with the U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday after meeting with Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa, al-Sahaf said Iraq has fully complied with the U.N.
resolutions and demanded lifting of the economic sanctions.

<P>
CAIRO, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The following are brief economic
news from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The Egyptian Ministry of Industry is considering
measures to raise the minimum percentage of locally manufactured
car parts from 40 percent to 60 percent in three years, the
Arabic-language Al Hayat daily reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
However, such measures will not cover air-conditioning and
radio-cassette sets which are considered as luxury items.
</P>
<P>
Local car companies have been negotiating with their
counterparts of other countries which supply component parts to
joint ventures engaged in the production of spare parts for export
purposes and for ensuring the needs of local car factories.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Egypt witnessed a rise in imports of car component
parts to approximately 600 million U.S. dollars. There are 13 car
factories in Egypt which produce about 50,000 cars a year.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The amount of cargo transiting through the Suez Canal
during the first seven months of 1999 has slightly declined to
223.8 million tons, down by 400,000 tons from 224.2 million tons
as compared to the corresponding period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the number of ships transiting the Canal during the
same period stood at 7,740, down by 216 ships from 7,956 during the
corresponding period of last year, the Arabic-language Al Hayat
newspaper reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
RAMALLA -- The World Bank has extended 380 million U.S. dollars in
grants and soft loans to the Palestinian National Authority ever
since 1993, said a bank official.
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- All Saudi banks are due to conduct emergency tests on
their computer sets before the end of September to check the Y2K
problem.
</P>
<P>
Local Iqtissadiya newspaper quoted Ibrahim Al Harabi, leader of
the adaptation team for the year 2000 problem at the Saudi
Monetary Fund/Central Bank Foundation, as saying that the tests
will evaluate human reaction in case of a flop in the sets or a
failure in electricity, should the unamended programs fail to read
the new date and hold to 1900's.

<HEADLINE> Make All Chinese As Fit As Fiddle (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 12 (Xinhua) -- "I have a dream, that one day
all Chinese are as fit as fiddle," said Ma hua, a popular aerobics
teacher in China.
</P>
<P>
Having taught aerobics in a sports program of China Central TV
for many years, Ma is well-known among Chinese citizens, and her
name is often related to figure building or shaping.
</P>
<P>
Looking at Ma, who is well in perfect shape, one cannot imagine
she was such a skinny girl before she took to shaping some 15
years ago.
</P>
<P>
"In those days I was so thin and tall, as good as a bamboo,"
she recalled with a smile, proud of her present stature.
</P>
<P>
Sitting in an armchair in the cafe of her fitness club, Ma told
Xinhua that she never thought she would become an aerobics teacher
until she took a fancy in disco in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
"Disco was so fascinating to youngsters at that time just like
the internet to young people in the mid-1990s. I turned to some
choreographers to learn disco who regarded my dancing as something
more like aerobics rather than disco, and that changed my life."
</P>
<P>
Ma took up aerobics teaching in 1985, at a time when disco, let
alone aerobics, was unfamiliar to most Chinese citizens.
</P>
<P>
"Believe it or not, I taught my first class in a shabby
classroom in the then Institute of Physical Education in Beijing,
and dancing with me are a group of faddy girls." Ma told the story
in retrospect.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the well-equipped Mahua Fitness Club, which opened
in November last year, covers an area of 900 square meters and
receives more than 300 visitors each day.

They are all kinds of people from college students and
businessmen to soldiers and workers, as well as foreigners working
in Beijing, from billionaires to wage earners.
</P>
<P>
Getting to this place, however, was not so easy and Ma had
problems from the very beginning. Her lessons were borrowed from
western models, which were not particularly suited to easterners.
Many of her students, especially women who had never done any
exercise, found that their legs were getting stronger after taking
aerobics classes, and many complained that they didn't want to
look like athletes, Ma said, adding that the younger women wanted
slim, graceful bodies.
</P>
<P>
She had no choice but to find out what people wanted and how to
help them get it. So, she spent a few years doing research and
finally came up with a set of answers that would produce students
who were admired by both easterners and westerners.
</P>
<P>
But, she's still not content, and is planning a new program to
help all Chinese stay fit through a scientific way of life. This
goes far beyond body building and requires a healthy life and
scientific diet to make bodies more resistant to diseases.  (

their average monthly income for exercise classes three times a
week.

A large number of her students are above 40 and most suffer
from occupational diseases and doing so is just a wise move, she
explained. Some common but dangerous illnesses like hypertension
and coronary heart disease can be prevented through exercise. And
a little exercise a day can keep the doctor away, she added,
recommending that people take her as an example.
</P>
<P>
Fitness clubs have a promising future and can be found in many
Chinese cities. There are several dozen in Beijing with all sorts
of facilities and services, but they couldn't possibly meet the
demand of the potential market of a city of this size.
</P>
<P>
Ma Hua has four branches in other cities and four more planned.
In the future, she'll cover all of China and give everybody access
to the benefits of a healthy body, she said.

WASHINGTON, September 11 (Xinhua) -- American Floyd Mayweather
Jr. retained his World Boxing Council (WBC) super featherweight
title after beating Carlos Gerena of Puerto Rico in Las Vegas on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Mayweather is undefeated in 22 fights, winning 17 inside the
distance. He knocked Gerena down twice in the first round and
battered him in the seventh, after which referee Richard Steele
stopped the bout on the advice of ringside doctor Flip Homansky.
</P>
<P>
On the undercard, unbeaten World Boxing Association
featherweight champion Freddie Norwood survived a stiff test from
Mexico's Juan Manuel Marquez.
</P>
<P>
Norwood was given the nod on all three judges' scorecards, 114-
112, 117-112 and 115-111.
</P>
<P>
Norwood used a second-round knockdown to build an early lead
against Marquez. But the challenger rallied and floored the
champion in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
The fight could have gone either way as late as the 10th round
but all three judges gave Norwood the final two rounds, allowing
the champion to improve to 3-0 in title defences.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Calls for Increasing Capability of Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AUCKLAND, New Zealand, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese
President Jiang Zemin aired his views on enhancing business
capability for self-development and international competition at a
dialogue meeting here Sunday between leaders of the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum and the APEC Business Advisory
Council.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that enterprises are the principal driving force
behind economic development. If an enterprise wishes to fare
successfully amid fierce competition in the face of challenges
posed by economic globalization and knowledge-based economy, it
must increase its capability for self-development and
international competition.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said: "In this regard, I would like to make a few remarks:
</P>
<P>
-- Paying greater attention to the development of human
resources. It is important to cultivate entrepreneurs with a
caliber for international commerce and global operational
strategies. The makings of entrepreneurs have become an important
factor that boosts the development of modern enterprises and
economic growth. The Integrated Plan of Action for SME Development
and the Kuala Lumpur Action Program on Skills Development in APEC
have targeted the training of entrepreneurs as a priority area for
APEC cooperation.
</P>
<P>
-- Establishing and perfecting the modern enterprise system, and
improving the management of enterprises. All enterprises have
experienced the ordeal of the Asian financial crisis that erupted
two years ago. Structural readjustment, improvement in management
and the establishment of the modern enterprise system have become
an urgent task facing enterprises. It is hoped that the business
community will improve its profitability and adaptability through
institutional innovations.
</P>
<P>
-- Strengthening economic and technical cooperation and
promoting the innovation-making capacity of enterprises.
Scientific research and development and technological innovation
have become an important instrument for enhancing the
competitiveness of enterprises. The APEC Agenda for Science and
Technology Industrial Cooperation into the 21st Century has
defined the principles and framework for the cooperation of
enterprises. I hope more enterprises of APEC members will deepen
their cooperation in the industry of science and technology by
means of this mechanism."

<HEADLINE> Senior Chinese, U.S. Officials Discuss Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AUCKLAND, New Zealand, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-
Premier Qian Qichen met with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright and Assistant to the President for National Security
Affairs Samuel Berger here Sunday to discuss China-U.S. relations
and other major issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Qian said that the China-U.S. relations have
witnessed ups and downs and difficulties in recent years, and that
some experience and lessons should be drawn on in this respect.
</P>
<P>
Both sides should promote the development of relations between
the two countries, Qian noted.
</P>
<P>
On the international situation, Qian said that currently there
are many international problems, including regional conflicts.
Such problems should still be settled in accordance with norms
governing international relations, such as the mutual respect of
sovereignty and territorial integrity, non-interference in others'
internal affairs and peaceful settlement of disputes.
</P>
<P>
The norms are not outdated, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Albright said the United States also considers the world as a
multi-polar one, is willing to cooperate with China, Russia and
the European Union, and attaches importance to the role of the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of Taiwan, Qian said that China and the United
States have exchanged views many times in recent years, and
reaffirmed that China's basic policies on settlement of the Taiwan
issue are "peaceful reunification" and "one country, two systems."
</P>
<P>
China will continue to make efforts toward that end, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the United States will prudently and
appropriately handle the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
Albright said that the summit meeting between Chinese President
Jiang Zemin and his U.S. counterpart Bill Clinton here on Saturday
was very significant, and that the United States values its
extensive relations with China.
</P>
<P>
Such relations are important to both the United States and
China, she said.
</P>
<P>
Berger said the United States views the U.S.-China summit on
Saturday as turning over a new leaf in the bilateral relations,
and that both sides should continue to make efforts and cooperate
with each other to expand common interests.
</P>
<P>
The senior Chinese and U.S. officials are here in company of
their respective top leaders to attend the two-day seventh
informal meeting of leaders of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum, which opened here Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Ebola Kills Seven in Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 12 (Xinhua) -- A new Ebola-like fever has
killed seven people in the gold mines in the Democratic Republic
of the Congo (DRC) , including a Ugandan soldier, the New Vision
paper reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
World Health Organization (WHO) officials reported that so far
73 people have died of the haemorrhagic fever caused by the virus
leading to rapid fatal internal bleeding.
</P>
<P>
There are dead rats, bats and human bodies decomposing in the
gold mines in Durba in the northwestern area of DRC, about 200 km
from Uganda border, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The international health body has called for the closure of
the gold mines. The latest seven victims, including three illegal
gold diggers and one Ugandan serviceman, a WHO official was quoted
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Although the DRC government has decided to close the mines,
the ongoing war has made it impossible to implement the closure,
sending more illegal suicidal miners to their deaths, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The area is said to be controlled by the rebels and therefore
it is unclear who would have the authority to close down the mines
and save the lives of the miners.
</P>
<P>
Another report said that a plane belonging to the French
medical charity Medicine sans Frontiers flew to Durba on Friday to
collect blood samples taken from the latest victims.

</P>
<P>
The Sunday Telegraph:
</P>
<P>

ground-attack jets to Indonesia on Saturday night and called for a

The Independent on Sunday:
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Famous Oilfield Well Developed in Northwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The Qinghai Oilfield, located
in the Qaidam Basin in the northern part of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau,
produced a total of 15.5 million tons of oil since it was first
built 44 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Its output rose on a year-on-year basis after its annual oil
output surpassed one million tons in 1991. The oilfield's
petroleum and gas output in 1998 topped the 2 million-ton mark.
The daily crude oil output has risen from 3,000 tons in 1994 to
present 54,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The Qaidam Basin, with a total area of 250,000 sq km, is
regarded as the treasure basin of the country. It has an oil
reserve of 4.1 billion tons and proven gas reserve of 150 billion
cubic meters, making it the fourth largest gasfield in China after
Sichuan Province, Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Region, and Tarim Basin in
the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Scientists succeeded in digging an exploring shaft in Lenghu
block in northwestern part of Qaidam Basin last year. The related
study of the Lengke NO.1 oil well proved that the Jurassic system
oil-bearing rocks coverage there was 13,000 sq km with a thickness
of 1,300 m.
</P>
<P>
Oil experts believe that Qaidam Basin will be China's leading
energy reserve base in the 21st century.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand to Discuss Cooperation on Rubber </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia, Thailand and
Indonesia, the three world major natural rubber producers, will
discuss cooperation in rubber production and other related
matters, Malaysian Primary Industries Minister Lim Keng Yaik said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The three largest natural rubber producers in the world need to
cooperate and establish short- and long-term programs to assist
smallholders in the three countries, he said in the southern state
of Johor, according to Bernama news agency.
</P>
<P>
"If Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia have an understanding on
production and other related matters concerning the commodity,
then a fall in prices in future could be avoided," he was quoted
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The three countries, which together account for more than 85
percent of world natural rubber production, need to be united in
addressing issues including the possibility of withdrawing from
the International Natural Rubber Organization.
</P>
<P>
A Malaysia-Thailand ministerial meeting would be held in
Pattaya, Thailand from September 16 to 18 while his visit to
Indonesia has yet to be determined, he said, adding that Malaysia
is expected to sign a memorandum of understanding with the Thai
government on matters concerning the commodity during his visit.
</P>
<P>
Lim said that on the domestic front, several proposals will be
submitted to a cabinet committee on ways of assisting
smallholders, which include setting up a fund which would offer
credit to smallholders to replant rubber trees and to buy modern
equipment to improve production, and merging the small-sized
holdings into bigger ones.

<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice Premier Wu Bangguo
has called for redoubled efforts to implement the Party's policies
on the reform and development of State-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Wu, also member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party
of China (CPC) Central Committee, made the call during a fact-
finding tour to east China's Anhui Province from September 6 to 10.
</P>
<P>
The CPC Central Committee and the State Council attach great
importance to the reform of State-owned enterprises, the vice
premier said.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, Jiang Zemin, General
Secretary of the CPC Central Committee, has convened a series of
meetings on the subject in cities of Chengdu, Wuhan, Xi'an,
Qingdao, and Dalian.
</P>
<P>
The upcoming 4th Plenary Session of the 15th CPC Central
Committee is to focus on the subject and make decisions on major
issues concerning the restructuring and development of State-owned
enterprises, Wu disclosed.
</P>
<P>
He said it is imperative to see clearly the present situation
of the State-owned enterprises' reform and development, and
further enhance confidence in managing well the enterprises.
</P>
<P>
State-owned enterprises have come to a key juncture of reform
and development, Wu noted.
</P>
<P>
Efforts must be focused now on the restructuring of State-owned
firms, the establishment of a modern enterprise system, the
solution of urgent problems such as excessive labor and backward
technologies, and the improvement of the social security system,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Many State-owned sectors including petrochemicals, machinery,
electronics, light industry, and textiles are turning losses into
profits as a result of deepened reforms, according to the vice
premier.

northeast China's Jilin Province. From 1960 to 1969, he studied
successively at local primary and secondary schools.
</P>
<P>
After 1970, he first worked at an army stud farm, and later
served as a trumpet player in a band of the Jilin Provincial
Forestry Armed Police Corps.
</P>
<P>
From 1978 to 1991, he worked as an attendant at a local
guesthouse run by the Jilin Provincial Forestry Armed Police Corps
and a member of the security section at the Changchun Municipal
Cereals and Oils Company.
</P>
<P>
Li Hongzhi began to propagate his ideas of "Falun Gong" cult
since the early 1990s. Initially, he fabricated the so-called "way
of practice" of "Falun Gong" by combining the movements of martial
arts he had learned from other people a few years before with
movements imitated from traditional Thai dancing.
</P>
<P>
Later, when he found that few people took interest in his "way
of practice," he changed the way of amassing money to treating
people with diseases by "exerting his energy potency".
</P>
<P>
But, cheating can never last long. After a period of scheming,
he concocted a set of lies and heretical theories of "Falun Gong"
and founded the "Falun Gong" organization with overtones of a cult.

<HEADLINE> Li Hongzhi Uses Falun Gong to Amass Dirty Money (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Li Hongzhi has illegally
reaped a large amount of dirty money by using Falun Gong and
committed crimes of tax evasion, according to a newly-published
book here.
</P>
<P>
Initial investigations reveals that from May 1992 to the end of
1994, Li and his collaborators collected more than three million
yuan (360,000 U.S. dollars) through running Falun Gong training
classes.
</P>
<P>
"They paid no taxes on the overwhelming part of the money,"
says the book entitled "Li Hongzhi &AMP; His 'Falun Gong'-- Deceiving
the Public and Ruining Lives," which was published by the New Star
Publishers.
</P>
<P>
The major source of Li's illegal income was the production,
publication, distribution and sale of books, audio and video tapes
and VCDs on Falun Gong as well as clothing and other articles
needed for the practice of Falun Gong, the book reveals.
</P>
<P>
It listed several of Li's economic crimes. From June 1997 to
July 1998, the Wuhan Shenshen Group Co. in central Hubei Province
handed over to Li and his "Research Society of Falun Dafa" 1.2
million yuan and 10,000 U.S. dollars for publishing Falun Gong-
related materials, on which "no individual income tax was paid,"
according to the book.
</P>
<P>
In the five years following June 1994, the Shandong Scientific,
Technological and Cultural Service Center in east China's Shandong
Province realized a net profit of over 8.3 million yuan in
publishing audio-visual products on Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
Now, it has been verified that the center had turned to the
society 700,000 yuan and to Li 90,000 yuan. In addition, it had
bought a "Santana" car for Li, who did not pay any income tax on
the amount he received.

<HEADLINE> Li Hongzhi's Fabrication of Life Story Exposed (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"At the age of 12, the Taoist Master Baji Zhenren (Eight-Pole
Immortal) taught me Taoist practices. In 1972, I received Taoist
instructions from Master Zhendaozi (True Taoist), and in 1974, I
received further training in Buddhist cultivation and returned to
public life."
</P>
<P>
Books compiled by the "Falun Gong" organization stated, "At the
age of eight, Li Hongzhi attained the superb Great Law with great
supernatural powers, such as the ability to move objects (without
lifting a finger), fix articles (at whatever spot), control other
people's thinking and make himself invisible.
</P>
<P>
He understands the truth of the universe, has insights into
life and can see the past and future of mankind."
</P>
<P>
Li changed his date of birth from July 7, 1952 to May 13, 1951.
But the date of birth remained July 7, 1952 in the forms he
previously filled in for determining his grade on his unit's
payroll, applying to join the Communist Youth League and obtaining
his ID cards issued on December 31, 1986 and March 31, 1991
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The reason of Li's making this change was simply to deify
himself. In the Chinese lunar calendar, the eighth day of the
fourth lunar month is believed to be the birthday of Sakyamuni,
founder of Buddhism, and May 13, 1951 happened to be such a day.
</P>
<P>
Thus, by changing his date of birth, Li intended to indicate
that he is "a reincarnation of Skyamuni".
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he had a photograph taken of himself in a stage
costume he bought from a store to give himself the "image of
Buddha" sitting on a lotus flower.

<P>
In their reaction to his fabricated story of "spiritual
cultivation," their answers were either "nonsense," or "impossible
", or "I have never seen or heard of that."
</P>
<P>
His superiors and roommates at the stud farm and the forestry
police corps also said that he was just an ordinary serviceman in
an art troupe.
</P>
<P>
His colleagues at the local cereals and oils company also said
that Li Hongzhi knew nothing about the so-called "way of practice"
and "spiritual cultivation" at all before he joined a Qigong (a
system of movements and deep breathing exercises) training class
in 1988.
</P>
<P>
In general, no one who had been on familiar terms with him knew
anything about him acquiring the "miraculous abilities" he himself
boasted about.
</P>
<P>
When Li's acquaintances asked him why he made up his life story,
Li answered, "No one would believe me if I do not exaggerate a
little bit."
</P>
<P>
But these lies and completely-fallacious "miraculous abilities"
deceived many practitioners of "Falun Gong" who knew little about
him.

<HEADLINE> APEC Leaders Given Traditional Maori Welcome </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the
21-member Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum received
a traditional welcome from the local Maoris on Sunday before
entering the close-door sessions of their seventh informal meeting.
</P>
<P>
The formal welcome, held at the luxurious Carlton Hotel in
downtown Auckland, was filled with exotic ceremonial color.
</P>
<P>
The welcome, called "powhiri," started with a group of Maori
women in traditional dresses chanting a slogan of "Without the
past, there is no future."
</P>
<P>
A group of Maori warriors then performed "haka," or the dance
before battle, likening the group of APEC leaders to an ocean-
going canoe that has arrived from afar and that has been hauled
ashore.
</P>
<P>
When the leaders, led by the host -- New Zealand Prime Minister
Jenny Shipley, were seated, two prominent Maori elders delivered
their speeches of welcome in a traditional way of chanting, first
in their native language and then in English.
</P>
<P>
The speeches of welcome ended with songs underlining the
messages in the speeches.
</P>
<P>
The singing being over, the APEC leaders were presented a
symbolic gift -- a large piece of nephrite jade widely referred to
in New Zealand as greenstone.
</P>
<P>
The whole ceremony of welcome ended with a nose rubbing between
the hosts and guests, and the APEC leaders were seen entering the
close-door sessions.
</P>
<P>
The two-day informal meeting started here Sunday with three
themes put forward by New Zealand: expanding opportunities for
business around the region, strengthening the functioning of
markets, and expanding support for APEC.
</P>
<P>
APEC was established in 1989 in response to the growing
interdependence among Asia-Pacific economies. Grouping 21 regional
economies under its banner, it was set up to improve the stability,
security and prosperity of its peoples.
</P>
<P>
The economic body comprises Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile,
China, China's Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New
Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Peru, the Philippines, Russia,
Singapore, South Korea, Chinese Taipei, Thailand, the United
States and Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Li Hongzhi Uses Falun Gong to Amass Dirty Money (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In April, 1996, Li bought a house valued at 311,000 yuan in
Changchun, capital of northeast China's Jilin Province. By forging
the contract, Li evaded 10,700 yuan in tax, the book reveals.
</P>
<P>
From the second half of 1996 to the first half of 1997, a
leading member of the society smuggled books on Falun Gong
published in Hong Kong to Beijing, and reaped 54 million yuan from
selling the books.
</P>
<P>
"All the money was remitted to the account provided by Ji Liewu,
Li Hongzhi's agent for the distribution of Falun Gong books
overseas," it says.
</P>
<P>
And all the proceeds from the sales of Falun Gong books outside
the mainland belong to Li Hongzhi.
</P>
<P>
"According to a reliable source, Li Hongzhi has large amounts
of savings deposits outside China, and has committed crimes of tax
evasion and money laundering," the book says.
</P>
<P>
The book also reveals that when traveling abroad, Li frequented
gambling clubs and places that provide sex services.
</P>
<P>
"According to people close to Li Hongzhi outside China, in 1997
when he traveled in Thailand, he visited brothels and took 'twin
baths' there to relish in the sex services," it says.
</P>
<P>
"Li also gambled in a casino in Brisbane, Australia," according
to the book, available in both Chinese and English.

<HEADLINE> New Book Reveals Tight Structure of Falun Gong Cult </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Only two million Chinese
people joined in the Falun Gong cult led by Li Hongzhi, who had
claimed that the number of practitioners was as many as 100
million, according to a new book published here.
</P>
<P>
The book, entitled "Li Hongzhi and His 'Falun Gong'-- Deceiving
the Public and Ruining Lives", also reveals the tight structure of
Falun Gong, which has been banned in the country since last July.
</P>
<P>
The "Research Society of Falun Dafa" was the top national organ
of the Falun Gong organization, and Li was its chairman, the book
says.
</P>
<P>
The society set up 39 general instruction offices, 1,900
ordinary instruction offices, and 28,000 practice sites throughout
the country.
</P>
<P>
Li's directives were relayed by the society to the various
general instruction offices, which then passed them to the
ordinary instruction offices, practice sites and individual
practitioners, it notes.
</P>
<P>
The Falun Gong organization demanded the practitioners should
go to the instruction offices and practice sites to practice every
day. They also held collective activities at regular intervals.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the Falun Gong organization "simply became tools
enabling Li to engage in all sorts of law-breaking activities,"
the book says.
</P>
<P>
After the true features of Li were brought to light, the
overwhelming majority of the practitioners suddenly woke up to
their misjudgment and severed their ties with the illegal
organization, it notes.

<P>
Li would never allow others to hold views which are not in line
with his preaching, says the book published by the "New Star
Publishers."
</P>
<P>
Whenever there was criticism of Li and his cult, they would
instigate and organize Falun Gong practitioners to hold illegal
gatherings, harass and attack those who voiced their criticisms,
the book says.
</P>
<P>
Since 1996, there were several hundred occasions of Falun Gong
besieging schools, media and publishing establishments, government
organs and even residences of individuals.
</P>
<P>
This culminated in April 1999, when organizers of Falun Gong
instigated more than 10,000 people to besiege Zhongnanhai, the
seat of the Central Government, in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"Their aim was to muzzle public opinion and threaten the
society in total disregard of law, so as to prevent other people
as well as the media and publishing organizations from voicing any
views that Falun Gong did not approve of," the book notes.
</P>
<P>
"This resulted in a situation in which no one could afford to
offend Li Hongzhi and his 'Falun Gong' organization, which
seriously undermined the normal public order, gravely disrupted
the normal life of the citizens and encroached upon other people's
freedom of speech and safety of the person," says the book.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President to Make Important Statement on E. Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J.
Habibie is expected to make an important statement on East Timor
at around 07:00 p.m. local time (1200 GMT) Sunday, the official
Antara News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
Antara did not say what the president will announce at a press
conference to be held at the presidential palace, but some sources
predicted it might be the Indonesian government's official
response to a call for an immediate deployment of a U.N.
peacekeeping force in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Violence has flared up in East Timor since the announcement of
the August 30 ballot result by the United Nations on September 4.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian military declared a state of emergency in East
Timor on September 7, but violence has not been stopped
completely. Reports said more than 100 people have been killed and
tens of thousands of houses burned down.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations and some Western countries have urged the
Indonesian government to invite international forces to East Timor
for the restoration of security and order in the territory.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian Defense Minister and Commander of the Armed Forces
Gen. Wiranto said on Saturday in Dili, capital of East Timor, that
"Bearing in mind the international pressure for a zero-accident
rate in East Timor as soon as possible, we cannot rule out the
possibility of accelerating the arrival of the peacekeeping
force."
</P>
<P>
East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, was integrated into
Indonesia in 1976, but the move was never recognized by the United
Nations.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania's Honeybee Exports Decline Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's exports of
honeybee declined sharply last year but bee wax exports increased
slightly, according to an official with the Ministry of Natural
Resources and Tourism.
</P>
<P>
Honeybee exports in 1998/99 (from July 1 of 1998 to June 30 of
1999) plunged to 39 tons from 225 tons in 1997/98, with foreign
exchange earnings dropping from 275,000 U.S. dollars to 36,000
U.S. dollars, said Director for Natural Resources Philemon
Luhanjo.
</P>
<P>
Luhanjo told Sunday Observer earlier this week that honeybee
production had decreased for lack of serious efforts to promote
bee keeping in the country.
</P>
<P>
Contrary to the decrease of honey bee exports, bee wax exports
in the east African country arrived at 332 tons earning a foreign
exchange of 1.2 million U.S. dollars, compared with 316 tons worth
1 million U.S. dollars in the previous year, he said.
</P>
<P>
But he said the current output is far from enough as the
country is capable of producing 9,200 tons of bee wax every year.
</P>
<P>
Bee wax production in Tanzania, he said, had shrunk over the
past decades because of unreliable foreign market.
</P>
<P>
Between 1978 and 1982, Tanzania was the third among the18 bee
wax exporters in the world, following the Netherlands and Germany,
the official said.

<HEADLINE> Li Advocates Heretical Ideas to Control People's Minds: Book (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Li Hongzhi, founder of the
banned Falun Gong organization, advocated heretical ideas so as to
control the minds of Falun Gong practitioners, according to a new
book published here.
</P>
<P>
Li claimed that he was the sole savior of the present world and
that he and his "Falun Dafa" could ward off the "inevitable
disasters and sufferings of the doomsday world."
</P>
<P>
"He ordered the practitioners of Falun Gong to obey him
absolutely, and to think and act in strict accordance with his
teachings so that he could control their minds," says the book,
entitled "Li Hongzhi &AMP; His 'Falun Gong'-- Deceiving the Public and
Ruining Lives."
</P>
<P>
Li adopted all sorts of heretical means to control the
practitioners, resulting in the deaths of many practitioners and
serious damage to the health of many others.
</P>
<P>
Incomplete statistics show that 1,404 people have died as a
result of practicing Falun Gong, and still more have been found to
be suffering from mental disorders for the same reason, says the
book, which is published by the "New Star Publishers."
</P>
<P>
According to doctors at the Beijing University of Medical
Science, the number of patients with psychiatric disorders caused
by Falun Gong has increased markedly.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, Falun Gong patients accounted for 10.2 percent of all
patients suffering from mental disorders. In the first half of the
year, the number soared to 42.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Among those who died as a result of practicing Falun Gong,
some were deceived by Li Hongzhi's 'doctrine of karma', and
refused to either consult doctors or take medicine when they fell
ill," the book reveals.

<P>
Others became mentally deranged in the course of practicing
Falun Gong. They either committed suicide or killed others, it
says.
</P>
<P>
What's more tragic is that some victims had put so much faith
in Li and his Falun Gong that they had let go untreated on his
orders and blamed themselves inwardly for not having enough faith
in "Master Li", the book says.
</P>
<P>
"Personal and family tragedies thus caused are too numerous to
mention one by one," the book adds.
</P>
<P>
"While Li Hongzhi told others not to consult doctors or take
medicine when they were sick, he did not himself practice what he
preached," it notes.
</P>
<P>
Many bills for reimbursement, turned in by Li and his family
members after consulting doctors and buying medicine, have been
found.
</P>
<P>
Now that his preposterous fallacies have been exposed, Li is
trying to deny that he advocated them. He himself had compiled,
printed and distributed books extolling such fallacies.
</P>
<P>
"How can he deny them when they are printed in black and white,
" the book asks.
</P>
<P>
"No responsible government in the world would tolerate a
heretical cult running rampant and depriving people of their lives
and health," the book notes, adding that Li can never escape
retribution for the crimes he has committed.

<HEADLINE> Li Hongzhi's Heretical Ideas Exposed (5) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Li called his "Falun Dafa" the "highest Law of Buddha" and the
"orthodox law" superior to all religions.
</P>
<P>
In order to make the practitioners of "Falun Gong" have total
faith in "Falun Dafa" and abide by the doctrines of his heretical
cult, Li Hongzhi forbade the practitioners to believe in any
religion.
</P>
<P>
He said, "The existing religions cannot save people from
torment any more. They cannot help you attain self-cultivation,
and so are on a low plane."
</P>
<P>
He further claimed, "As for Buddhism, Christianity, Judaism
and some other religions, I admit that they have been orthodox
religions in history. However, in this historical period and in
this society, when the concept of mankind is being modernized, it
has become impossible for people to understand the true concept of
the nature of man from ancient ideas."
</P>
<P>
He said "you cannot understand the old religions, and of course
you cannot be converted by them. Consequently, they will not care
about you."
</P>
<P>
"I tell you this because I'm afraid you may be led astray by
the religions that cannot relieve people of their torment."
</P>
<P>
He also said, "Some religions have come into being in this
century. No, not only this century, over the past few centuries
many new religions have appeared. Most of them are fake."
</P>
<P>
Leaders of China's religious circles pointed out that not only
do Li Hongzhi and his "Falun Dafa" have nothing whatsoever to do
with religion, their heretical ideas are directly opposed to
religious doctrines, and are therefore anti-religious.

Li claimed to practitioners of "Falun Gong", "None of you, my
disciples, or masters of other schools of Qigong, has law-bodies.
As far as I know, I am the only one in the world who has law-
bodies."
</P>
<P>
"I have countless law-bodies, who look exactly like me. They
are in another space, and can change their sizes limitlessly and
freely."
</P>
<P>
He went on to say, "I am the main body, but they (the law-
bodies) have the ability to do things independently. They can look
after you, protect you, help you to practice, and do other things..
..That's how I can protect you."
</P>
<P>
He told "Falun Gong" practitioners, "Human beings are stained
with too much karma and evil thinking. But I can rid you of all
that, and install in you the bright golden 'wheels of law,'
together with many other things included in 'Falun Dafa', so that
you can cultivate yourselves and purge your hateful, dirty bodies..
.You are incomparably lucky to have it."
</P>
<P>
"The 'wheel of law,' which I install in a practitioner's
abdomen, revolves 24 hours a day," he said. It automatically helps
the practitioner in his or her practice. "In other words, although
the practitioner is not practicing all the time, the 'wheel of law
' is cultivating the practitioner non-stop."

Li proclaimed to practitioners of "Falun Gong" cult that "
science today is not science in the real sense, because you can
never use this science to probe into the profound mysteries of the
universe."
</P>
<P>
Li said that "the science of mankind today is, in fact,
developed from a wrong basis; its understanding of the universe,
mankind and life is all wrong. So, in our circles of practitioners
we never acknowledge modern science, holding it to be erroneous."
</P>
<P>
While preaching the "doomsday" theory, Li Hongzhi claimed that
only he himself and his "Falun Dafa" can save mankind.
</P>
<P>
He repeatedly told practitioners of "Falun Gong" that "Falun
Dafa" had, for the first time since the Creation, enlightened
human beings to the characteristics of the universe (Law of
Buddhist), which is tantamount to providing mankind with a ladder
to Heaven."
</P>
<P>
He said, "Now I am the only person in the world who can spread
the orthodox Law of Buddha. Therefore, I am doing a deed that has
never been done by our predecessors."
</P>
<P>
He also said to the practitioners, "I am here to save you from
this miserable world. If I cannot save you, there is no one in the
world able to do so."
</P>
<P>
"My law-bodies (supernatural replicas of himself existing in
the ether) are so numerous that they are beyond calculation.
Therefore, I can look after as many people as I want, maybe the
entire human race."

The book, entitled "Li Hongzhi and His 'Falun Gong' --
Deceiving the Public and Ruining Lives", disclosed that on many
occasions Li Hongzhi had told his audience: "The human race has
experienced many destructive catastrophes," and "the next complete
destruction -- will come soon."
</P>
<P>
He told his followers, "I have found that the mankind has
experienced 81 calamities in the past, and each time there were
only a few people who survived."
</P>
<P>
He declared, "Mankind on this earth faces inexorable doom. Our
planet should have been totally destroyed last year, according to
my calculations." He said it was he himself who had made the
destruction postponed by 30 years.
</P>
<P>
While hawking the theory of "doomsday", Li Hongzhi cursed the
human race and regarded the Earth as a rubbish heap.
</P>
<P>
When preaching to practitioners of "Falun Gong," Li repeatedly
told them that the mankind was very dreadful. He said, "if you
look around, you will find that the human world today is extremely
terrible, really terrible, full of vicious persons." "There are
devils everywhere."
</P>
<P>
"Hence, the gods have completely lost confidence in mankind.
This is one of the major reasons why the gods do not care about
human beings any more."

dropping into the central part of it, which is the Earth.
Consequently, the Earth serves as the rubbish heap of the universe.

"Those who have descended to the level of ordinary people are
destined to be destroyed," he added.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Strives to Turn Youth Into Skilled Manpower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister
Sheikh Hasina said Saturday that her government is working to turn
the country's youth into skilled manpower by giving them modern
and developed education.
</P>
<P>
If upgraded into skilled manpower, young people will play an
important role in building up the country's economy, Hasina told
the foundation-laying ceremony of Dinajpur Hajee Danesh Science
and Technology University, according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
As part of its plan to establish science and technology
universities in 12 greater districts, the government has upgraded
Hajee Danesh Agriculture College into a full-pledged Science and
Technology University where agriculture will be a faculty.
</P>
<P>
It is the second science and technology university in the
country. The government plans to establish four more such
universities by 2002.
</P>
<P>
Hasina said the next century will be an era of science and
technology when every single person would have to compete for his
existence.
</P>
<P>
As there will be no alternative to science and technology based
education, the government wants to develop the huge population
into human resources by giving them education befitting to the
time, she noted.
</P>
<P>
Referring to her government's success in raising the country's
literacy rate, Hasina said that it is 58 percent as against 47
percent three years ago, adding that Bangladesh will be able to
free the nation from the course of illiteracy by the year 2006.

<HEADLINE> Serena Williams Stuns Hingis to Win U.S. Open Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Seventh seed Serena Williams
of the United States proclaimed herself a star in her won right on
Saturday as she upset top seed Martina Hingis of Switzerland 6-3,
7-6(7-4) to win the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
Competing in her first Grand Slam final, the 17-year-old
Williams, who has played in the shadow of her 19-year-old sister
Venus, pulled off what Venus has not been able to do, beat Hingis
in a Grand Slam tournament and win a major title. Her victory
over Hingis came one day after the Swiss teenager rallied in the
third set to defeat Venus in the semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
"I've been practicing so long for this and now it's here,"
Williams said. "It's hard to believe. I've been working for the
U.S. Open since Wimbledon when I wasn't able to play. I was able
to take advantage of my opportunity. You don't get opportunities
often and you have to take advantage."
</P>
<P>
Williams joins Althea Gibson as the only black women to win a
Grand Slam title and is the first black since Arthur Ashe won
Wimbledon in 1975 to win a Grand Slam event. She became the lowest
seeded female in the Open Era since 1968 to win the U.S. Open and
collected 750,000 U.S. dollars for the victory.
</P>
<P>
On the men's side, second seed Andre Agassi outslugged and
outworked Yevgeny Kafelnikov of Russia 1-6, 6-3, 6-3, 6-3 in a
baseline duel on Saturday to set up an all-American final Sunday
against seventh seed Todd Martin.
</P>
<P>
With the victory, Agassi also will assume the No. 1 ranking in
men's tennis from fellow American Pete Sampras, who had to
withdraw from the tournament due to a disc problem in his back.
Kafelnikov, the third seed, could have grabbed the top spot in the
ATP rankings by beating Agassi.
</P>
<P>
Williams' go-for-broke style produced 19 winners and 25
unforced errors in the opening set. Hingis managed only one
winner and made five unforced errors and won 25 of her 34 points
in the set on Williams' errors. Hingis converted only one of
seven break-point opportunities in the opening set.
</P>
<P>
For the match, Williams had 36 winners and 56 unforced errors,
with several of her key shot coming off Hingis' serve. She also
had eight aces and three doubles faults.
</P>
<P>
Hingis, who seemed listless and confused until her late burst,
managed only seven winners and made an uncharacteristic 24
unforced errors, including the last two that cost her the tiebreak
and the match.
</P>
<P>
"I had my chance and I didn't take them," said Hingis. "She
pulled it out better today. She was always leading. I felt I was
always behind, always had to be defensive. She was just better
today."
</P>
<P>
Venus and Serena Williams advanced to finals of women's doubles
with a 7-6 (7-2), 6-3 victory Saturday night over the 12th-seeded
duo of Mary Pierce of France and Barbard Schett of Austria.
</P>
<P>
In the men's action, Agassi had 33 winners and 40 unforced
errors while Kafelnikov hit 34 winners and committed 49 unforced
errors in the two hour, 12-minute match.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's victory was Agassi's 34th in his last 38 matches,
with three of the losses coming against Sampras.

BEIJING, September 12 (Xinhua) -- In 1950, shortly after the
founding of the People's Republic of China, a beautiful foreign
lady could be seen on the streets of Beijing riding a bike with a
camera and from time to time aiming her lens at the hustle and
bustle of the lives of ordinary Beijingers.
</P>
<P>
Her exotic face seldom incurred impoliteness, other than a few
surprised glances. People usually cast friendly smiles her way,
smiles that remain forever on her photographs.
</P>
<P>
Today, this 88-year-old woman who is a Chinese citizen has the
tens of thousands of photos she took, a precious record reflecting
China in the 1950s and 1960s, showing the world how China has
changed since those days.
</P>
<P>
The German-born Eva became connected with China when, 65 years
ago, she and the well-known Chinese poet and Communist Xiao San
fell in love at their first glimpse in the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
In 1939, she arrived in Yan'an where she met Xiao's schoolmate
from Hunan Teacher's School, a man who was also the co-founder of
the progressive "Xinmin Society"-- Mao Zedong. It was at this time
and place when she first received a Chinese name -- Ye Hua.
</P>
<P>
The founding of New China excited the couple tremendously. "The
country everywhere was dynamic and seething with enthusiasm,"
recalled Ye," Clouds of flies that used to gather on the food sold
by peddlers gradually disappeared...it's hardly believable that
these neatly dressed and well-behaved children were once wild ones
covered with lice and begging along the streets...Many new operas
were staged in the theater..."

Ye even made it to Tibet, where she found that "vegetables
Tibetans never saw before were available, and children that couldn
't go to school before 1951 were seated in classrooms."

In the eyes of Ye Hua, a new world has emerged here, where
people are building a free and prosperous new China. "I could
hardly imagine it a couple of years ago," she said.
</P>
<P>
For half a century, Ye's fate was closely connected to that of
China. She enjoyed the glittering days endowed with love, but also
suffered hardships when she was imprisoned for seven years during
the turmoil of the Cultural Revolution (1966-76).
</P>
<P>
"I grow up along with the New China," she said in simple
Chinese. "If China is good, I am happy and, if China is bad, I am
painful."
</P>
<P>
"Now that five decades have passed, people are living a better
and happy life, they are better educated, and have more freedom to
do what they like," Ye said.
</P>
<P>
An idealistic and frank woman, Ye didn't hide her
dissatisfactions, saying that "I love China, that's why I greatly
minded those problems."
</P>
<P>
However, she added that "those problems will surely be overcome
as they are temporary phenomena during the country's step forward.
"
</P>
<P>
"China keeps changing for the better, and this is an
irreversible trend." Ye put her hand to her chest, and said, "I am
deeply rooted in China, my heart beats for China."

MANILA, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 17 million kilos of
tobacco have been lost due to the abnormal rains in March and
April, seriously affecting the Philippines' tobacco industry, the
National Tobacco Administration (NTA) said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The rains, which could be attributed to the La Nina and El Nino
phenomena, destroyed some 13.5 million kilos of Virginia tobacco,
and 3.5 million kilos of native tobacco and other tobacco, said
the NTA in a report released here.
</P>
<P>
"These losses constitute 21.59 percent of the total volume of
production for the current year 1998-99, adversely affecting
28,896 farmers or 46.3 percent of the total number of tobacco
farmers, covering an estimated 11,319.88 hectares or 28.1 percent
of the total area planted to tobacco," the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the farmers who suffered from the El
Nino/La Nina-induced rains have been practically reduced to
marginal living.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The China Insurance
Regulatory Commission (CIRC) today announced major measures to
further improve the management of part-time insurance agents.
</P>
<P>
The new measures came after a comprehensive review of all part-
time insurance agents' licenses, which began in March this year.
</P>
<P>
The new policy provides that each agent can only broker for
four insurers at the same time, among which, there can be only one
life insurer.
</P>
<P>
All the agents must strictly adhere to the contracts signed
with insurers and must not change any items on the policies,
neither can they lower or increase the premium, the commission
said.
</P>
<P>
Insurance firms must tighten control over their part-time
agents and must not employ any unauthorized part-time agents, it
added.
</P>
<P>
The CIRC warned that anyone caught violating any of these
regulations will be dealt with in an appropriate manner.
</P>
<P>
A telephone hot-line number has been made available to the
public for informing the commission of any violations.

<HEADLINE> China Publishes New Book Exposing Falun Gong (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 12 (Xinhua) -- A new book aimed at helping
people know more about the banned Falun Gong organization and its
leader has come off press here recently.
</P>
<P>
The book, entitled "Li Hongzhi &AMP; His 'Falun Gong'-- Deceiving
the Public and Ruining Lives," provides basic information about
Falun Gong and its founder Li Hongzhi.
</P>
<P>
Published in both Chinese and English, the book also reveals
new facts of Li's law-breaking activities, such as tax evasion,
money laundering and visits to gambling clubs and brothels.
</P>
<P>
"Li Hongzhi has large amounts of savings deposits outside China,
and has committed crimes of tax evasion and money laundering," the
book says.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Government declared the Falun Gong organization
illegal on July 22, 1999. A week later, the Ministry of Public
Security issued a warrant for the arrest of Li Hongzhi.
</P>
<P>
Since mid-July, an overwhelming majority of former Falun Gong
practitioners have seen through the true faces of Falun Gong and
its founder Li Hongzhi, and broken away from the illegal
organization.
</P>
<P>
However, for those who have not followed media reports over the
past two months, this new book provides them with another chance
to know who Li Hongzhi is and what kind of organization Falun Gong
is.
</P>
<P>
"This book is a comprehensive examination of the facts about
this illegal organization, its sinister founder and its victims,"
according to the book's publisher "New Star Publishers."
</P>
<P>
The book, whose English version has 150 pages, consists of five
chapters, including Li Hongzhi and his fallacies, selected cases
of Falun Gong victims, and a list of deaths and dysphrenia
resulting from practicing Falun Gong.

<P>
The book records the heretical fallacies Li has repeatedly
preached to the practitioners, such as the "doomsday theory", the
earth as a rubbish heap, and the claim he himself is the only
savior of mankind.
</P>
<P>
"This book exposes Li Hongzhi, the man and his deeds, and his
malicious fallacies, and reveals cases, in which people have died
or become mentally disordered as a result of practicing and being
obsessed with Falun Gong," says the book in its foreword.
</P>
<P>
"Included in this book is only a small part of the large number
of those cases. The book also gives examples of Li Hongzhi's other
crimes to violate the law and harm the society," it says.
</P>
<P>
Numerous facts prove that Falun Gong is not a religion but a
cult that brings harm to the society and an illegal organization
that engages in law-breaking activities, it notes.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that this book will help people to see clearly the
true nature of Li Hongzhi and his Falun Gong organization," says
the author named Ji Shi.

<HEADLINE> Multinational Peace Force in Southeastern Europe Opens Headquarters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The Multinational Peace Force
in Southeastern Europe (MPSEE) inaugurated its headquarters
Saturday afternoon in Plovdiv, the second largest city of Bulgaria
in the south.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the ceremony, Bulgarian President and Supreme
Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, Peter Stoyanov, said the
inauguration of the first MPSEE headquarters in Bulgaria "is
fully in line with one of Bulgaria's major political external
priorities involving the establishment of good neighborly and
friendly relations among the countries in the region."
</P>
<P>
He said his country's efforts are focused on building a
peaceful and secure region and making it an integral part of a
united Europe in the future.
</P>
<P>
The president was confident that sooner or later Serbia and
other republics of former Yugoslavia will join the peace force.
</P>
<P>
He also voiced firm opposition to attempts to maltreat the Serb
population in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Chief of the MPSEE political-military supervisory committee

<HEADLINE> Chinese Film Wins Top Prize at Venice Film Festival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese film "Not One Less"
directed by Zhang Yimou won the top Golden Lion prize at the 56th
Venice Film Festival on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
The film tells the story of a substitute teacher in a Chinese
village who tried hard to bring back to school a boy unable to
attend classes any more. The jury of the festival said they were
deeply touched by the natural and sincere feeling displayed by a
cast of non-actors, most of them children.
</P>
<P>
The film is Zhang's second Golden Lion title at the Venice
Festival after he first won the prize seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian film "The Wind Will Carry Us," directed by Abbas
Kiarostami, took the jury's special prize.
</P>
<P>
Best acting honors went to French actress Nathalie Baye in "A
Pornographic Liaison" and to Britain's Jim Broadbent for his role
in "Topsy-Turvy."
</P>
<P>
Some 120 films all over the world were shown at the festival
starting on September 1, with 18 of them competing for the Golden
Lion prize.

<HEADLINE> EU Finance Ministers Meet in Finland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Finance ministers and
central bank governors of 15 European Union members discussed
regional economic prospects, the tax package deal and shortening
the double currency period during an informal meeting which began
on Saturday in Turku, Finland.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day meeting, which was also attended by
officials from the European Central Bank and the European Union
Commission, ministers and top bankers agreed that the economic
prospects of the 15-nation bloc are improving and that the status
of the euro is being enhanced.
</P>
<P>
Yyes-Thibault de Silguy, the European Union's commissioner for
economic and monetary affairs, said that the European Economic and
Monetary Union has had a good beginning and the euro has gained
the ability to shield the Union's members from global financial
storms.
</P>
<P>
The EU Commission forecast the economic growth of its members
for this year and next year will be 2 percent and 2.7 percent
respectively, Silguy said.
</P>
<P>
He also urged EU members to cut budget deficit and undertake
economic restructuring.
</P>
<P>
Ministers and bankers spent much time discussing the cut of
value-added tax (VAT) on service sectors for the creation of
thousands more job opportunities.
</P>
<P>
They reached agreement that EU governments could have a free
hand next year to start piloting on lowering VAT on two of the
following five labor-intensive, low-paid and community- based
services: hairdressing, small repairs of bicycles and shoes,
renovation of private housing, cleaning and home care.
</P>
<P>
The chair of the meeting, Finnish Finance Minister Sauli
Niinisto, hailed the agreement as being important and a good
signal for broader discussions on tax issue in the future.
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, ministers could not narrow their differences
over taxation on savings.
</P>
<P>
Britain fears a proposal supported by most other EU nations for
a 20 percent tax on interest from savings will hit the euro bond
market mostly based in London.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was also rejected by Luxembourg, which does not
tax foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Niinisto said the ministers will wrap up a tax deal by a
December summit in Helsinki.
</P>
<P>
Participants of the meeting also agreed to shorten the double
currency period in most of the 11 euro countries from six months
to two months.
</P>
<P>
The Y2K (Year 2000) problem, relief funds in Kosovo and western
Balkans were also topics at the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Chile's Fishing Exports Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Chile's exports of fishing
products rose to 1.035 billion U.S. dollars during the first seven
months of this year, a 2.4 percent of increase over the same
period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Data from the Fishing Subsecretariat published Saturday say
that in terms of the export volume, the increase in the period is
10.7 percent over last year, corresponding to 679,008 tons.
</P>
<P>
Both figures show a continued trend in the recovery of the
fishing exporting sector, after falling demand especially of the
Asian region.
</P>
<P>
The data show the growing importance of the export of frozen
products, which increased by 16.4 percent to 506.8 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Philippine Presidents Discuss Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AUCKLAND, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang
Zemin and his Philippine counterpart, Joseph Estrada, held talks
here Sunday to discuss relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Jiang said that relations between China and
the Philippines are generally favorable and that great progress
has been made in bilateral friendly cooperation in all fields
since the two countries established diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
The progress has come as a result of joint efforts by both
countries over the past two decades, he said.
</P>
<P>
As the progress has not come easily, it should be treasured, he
added.
</P>
<P>
China attaches importance to its relations with the Philippines,
a major member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (
ASEAN), and is willing to expand the mutually beneficial
cooperation between the two countries in all fields, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"We should focus our attention on the fundamental interests of
the peoples of the two countries, and promote the development of
bilateral relations toward long-term stability," he said.
</P>
<P>
As China and the Philippines are close neighbors, many problems
can be settled as long as the two sides can exchange views
sincerely, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Estrada agreed that relations between the Philippines and China
are favorable. He expressed confidence that exchanges and
cooperation between the two countries in the fields of economy,
trade, science, technology, agriculture, finance and others will
be further strengthened.
</P>
<P>
He said he expects Chinese leaders to attend the forthcoming
informal meeting in the Philippines of leaders from ASEAN as well
as from China, Japan and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
In response, Jiang said that the meeting will be of great
significance to enhancing mutual understanding and confidence
among East Asian countries, strengthening mutual cooperation among
them and promoting stability and development of the region.
</P>
<P>
The talks between Jiang and Estrada were held ahead of the
informal meeting of leaders of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum, scheduled to open here later Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Jiang: China Happy with Ties with Mexico </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AUCKLAND, September 12 (Xinhua) -- China is pleased with its
ties with Mexico and believes wide-ranging bilateral cooperation
would score greater progress in the new century through concerted
efforts, President Jiang Zemin said here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo Ponce
de Leon, Jiang said since the establishment of diplomatic ties,
political, economic, trade, scientific and technological, and
cultural cooperation between the two countries has been developing
smoothly. "I'm very happy with this momentum," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Elaborating China's viewpoints on the Asian financial crisis,
Jiang said although China has paid a great deal for that crisis,
it still refuses to devalue its currency Renminbi in order to
safeguard the financial stability in the Asia-Pacific region and
the world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he went on, China has adopted a pro-active
financial policy and expanded domestic demand, which have pushed
the country's sustainable economic development.

<HEADLINE> Brazil to Allow Foreign Oil Firms to Have Dollar Accounts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The National Monetary
Council (CMN), a branch of the Central Bank of Brazil in charge of
the country's monetary policy, will permit foreign firms operating
in the oil and energy fields to have accounts in dollars and other
foreign currencies in the national banking system.
</P>
<P>
CMN officials said Saturday that the decision will reduce the
pressure on the exchange market which comes from the demands for
dollars by foreign firms operating here.
</P>
<P>
Central Bank International Affairs Director Daniel Gleizer said
that for a start the permission will be limited to foreign firms
of the oil and energy sector, because they are the ones which
have the biggest need for hard currencies.
</P>
<P>
Gleizer told the O Globo newspaper that "projects in the oil
and energy areas take a long time to show results, so foreign
firms protect themselves against possible economic changes by
taking refuge in the dollar."
</P>
<P>
The official explained that for this reason, the CMN measure is
aimed at reinforcing foreign investor investment and reducing the
pressure on the foreign exchange market, which fluctuated badly
during past weeks.

<TEXT>
<P>
AUCKLAND, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang
Zemin and Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi held talks here
Sunday on relations between their two countries.
</P>
<P>
In the talks, Obuchi expressed his willingness to make greater
efforts for further promoting the development of Sino-Japanese
relations.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi said that Japan actively supports China's accession to
the World Trade Organization (WTO) at an early date.
</P>
<P>
As the 50th anniversary of the founding of the People's
Republic of China is approaching, Obuchi expressed his cordial
congratulations on China's achievements during the past 50 years.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the same occasion, Jiang said that the development
of relations between China and Japan is generally in a favorable
momentum, but the two sides should make further efforts to
maintain this trend.
</P>
<P>
In particular, sensitive issues challenging the two countries
should be appropriately settled in the interests of the overall
bilateral relations, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president expounded to Obuchi China's positions on
its accession to the WTO and the issue of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
He said China has noticed that the Japanese government
reaffirmed its persistence in the one-China policy and its policy
of not supporting Taiwan's independence immediately after Lee Teng-
hui dished out the "two-states" theory.
</P>
<P>
China hopes that Japan will strictly stick to its declared
positions and commitments made on the issue of Taiwan, he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Coal-bed Methane Co-development Proposed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 12 (Xinhua)-- China expects to speed up the
exploration of its coalbed methane (CBM) fields by beefing up its
co-operation with foreign firms, China Daily "Business Weekly"
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The China United Coalbed Methane Co Ltd (CUCBM) is negotiating
with several foreign partners to enhance overseas co-operation
after signing six contracts with four companies of the United
States, said Sun Maoyuan, vice-president of the corporation.
</P>
<P>
"The huge potential for coalbed methane development in China
has drawn wide international attention," Sun said.
</P>
<P>
The CUCBM will try to create a more favorable exploration
climate for foreign companies, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"We are asking relevant departments under the State Council to
simplify procedures and approve the blocks to be opened up for
foreign companies," Sun said. "We are also asking them to exempt
or reduce several taxes and fees such as the value-added tax,
income taxes and exploration permit fees."
</P>
<P>
The State Council has given the CUCBM exclusive right to
undertake the exploration, development and production of coalbed
methane in co-operation with overseas partners.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Government has approved the opening of nine coalbed
methane blocks for foreign co-operation. These are in the areas of
north and south of Huaihe River in Anhui, eastern areas of the
Taihang Mountains in North China, and Linxing, Sanjiao, North
Sanjiao, Shilou and Liulin areas in Shanxi, and Fengcheng of
Jiangxi.
</P>
<P>
Texaco Inc of the U.S. the first overseas company to join in
the project. It signed a contract with CUCBM on January 8, 1998,
in Beijing to jointly explore coalbed methane resources at the
Huaibei coal mine in Anhui.
</P>
<P>
On June 29, CUCBM wrapped up three contracts with Arco of the U.
S. to jointly develop coalbed methane resources in Sanjiao, North
Sanjiao and Shilou concessions in Shanxi. It also signed a
contract with Phillips, of the U.S., for the co-operative
development of coalbed methane in the Linxing concessions in
Shanxi.
</P>
<P>
On August 13, 1999, the CUCBM and SABA Petroleum Inc of the U.S.
signed a contract in Beijing to explore CBM resources in Fengcheng
of Jiangxi Province.
</P>
<P>
"The CUCBM is likely to sign three more contracts with foreign
companies late this year," said Fan Zhiqiang of the corporation.
</P>
<P>
CUCBM has mapped out seven targets for international
cooperation. Their exploration awaits approval of the State
Council, Fan said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to international cooperation, the CUCBM has decided
to set up its own coalbed methane development base in the Qinshui
basin of Shanxi, according to Sun.
</P>
<P>
With a total area of 550 sq km, Qinshui basin is expected to
produce 40-50 million cubic metres of coalbed methane annually
during the next two years.
</P>
<P>
China's coalbed methane reserves, estimated to about 30,000-
35000 billion cubic metres, are located about 2,000 metres
underground.
</P>
<P>
CUCBM would like to produce 3 billion cubic metres of CBM
annually by 2005, 10 billion cubic metres annually by 2010, and 20
billion cubic metres by 2015.

<P>
AUCKLAND, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang
Zemin and his Peruvian counterpart, Alberto Fujimori, met Sunday
and exchanged views on bilateral relations and issues of common
concern.
</P>
<P>
The meeting took place on the sidelines of the seventh informal
meeting of leaders of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
forum.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that since his meeting with Fujimori last November,
friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries have
progressed steadily in various fields through joint efforts.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-Peruvian political ties have become closer with
frequent exchange of visits and contacts between leaders of the
two countries, the Chinese president said. Trade and economic
cooperation is very fruitful and Peru has become one of China's
major trade partners in Latin America and one of the largest
recipients of Chinese investment.
</P>
<P>
On international arenas, Jiang said, the two countries lend
support to each other through close cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president thanked Fujimori for Peru's support to
China at the U.N. conference on human rights in Geneva and for the
sympathy and condolences conveyed by Fujimori and the Peruvian
government to the Chinese people over the NATO bombing of the
Chinese Embassy in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
As to China's entry into the WTO, Jiang said China has adopted
a positive but principled attitude and that the principles he
expounded at the first informal meeting of APEC leaders in Seattle
in 1993 remain unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president also briefed Fujimori on China's position
on the Taiwan issue and appreciated Peru's adherence to the "one
China" policy.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Insurance Company to Form Venture Company </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The Sun Life Assurance
Company of Canada is expected to sell its first life insurance
policy in China during the second half of next year, according to
China Daily "Business Weekly" today.
</P>
<P>
The company gained approval from the China Insurance Regulatory
Commission in April to create a joint venture life insurance firm.
</P>
<P>
"We are actively seeking a joint venture partner," said Dkiran
Ohannessian, a company vice-president responsible for establishing
the venture.
</P>
<P>
He said some candidates, non-bank financial institutions, have
been identified and a final decision could be made in coming
months.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said, the company is considering where it will
take its first step on entering the Chinese insurance market.
</P>
<P>
Sun Life has more choices than its predecessors in the business
because the country is opening another four cities including
Tianjin, Dalian, Chongqing and Shenzhen to join Shanghai and
Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
Sun Life's entry to the Chinese market is expected to result in
additional competition.
</P>
<P>
The entry of foreign insurance companies during the past few
years has provided an incentive for domestic insurance companies
to improve their services. This has created a larger market, the
Business Weekly says.

<P>
BEIJING, September 12 (Xinhua) -- China will allow eligible
overseas-invested businesses to issue domestic currency A shares
or foreign currency B shares.
</P>
<P>
"Foreign-invested enterprises meeting the requirements can
apply to issue A or B shares," today's China Daily "Business

saying.
</P>
<P>
Most companies listed in Shenzhen or Shanghai are controlled by
the state. Only a small number of them are private firms or
foreign-invested companies ahead of their initial public offerings
of A or B shares.
</P>
<P>
Few Chinese mainland-based companies in which foreign investors
held a 100 percent or a controlling stake have received approval
to issue shares to the public.
</P>
<P>
Ma told delegates to the China Fair for International
Investment and Trade that China would set up special industry
funds to help cash-short Chinese investors expand their stakes in
Sino-foreign joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, it would allow domestic commercial banks to issue
loans to Chinese shareholders to increase capital in Sino-foreign
joint ventures, she said.

<HEADLINE> New Materials Influence Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 12 (Xinhua) -- New materials is now
spreading into almost every aspect of modern Chinese life.
</P>
<P>
In the 1994-98 period, the industrial output of new materials
rose in value to 13.2 billion yuan (1.6 billion U.S. dollars), 34.
8 percent of the total high-tech yield, China Daily "Business
Weekly" reports today.
</P>
<P>
It also earned more than 100 million U.S. dollars in foreign
currency, representing as much as 47.6 percent of the high-tech
realm's total.
</P>
<P>
More than 400,000 people working in more than 1,000 enterprises
and nearly 500 research institutes and universities and colleges
in China are engaged in developing or manufacturing new materials
products.
</P>
<P>
China's Torch Plan Program, initiated to introduce high
technologies in industry, listed 395 new materials projects
between 1988 and 1994. This served as a guideline for the country'
s high-tech industry, and these programs accounted for 26.2
percent of 1,503 State programs during the period.
</P>
<P>
Partly as a result of governmental guidance and support, a
handful of new materials enterprises grew to become heavy weight
player in the market.
</P>
<P>
This is evident in the automobile, electronics and information
technology industries where new materials are heavily used and are
expected to form the basis for further development of the new
materials industry, industrial analysts said.
</P>
<P>
If 30 percent of the materials needed to build a car are new
materials, according to the experience of the United States auto
industry, and if China manufactures 1.5 million cars and 1.5
million other vehicles during 2000 as planned, the automobile
industry in 2000 could foster a new materials market valued at
more than 60 billion yuan (7.2 billion U.S. dollars).

<P>
WASHINGTON, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Rookie driver Gonzalo
Rodriguez of Uruguay was killed Saturday in a crash during
practice for the Shell 300 at Laguna Seca Raceway.
</P>
<P>
The 27-year-old Uruguayan Indy-car driver died of massive head
and neck injuries after his car hit a concrete wall at about 225
kph.
</P>
<P>
He was the first driver fatality in the CART series since Jeff
Krosnoff was killed in a crash during a race in Toronto in July
1996.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Mercedes said telemetry records from the car
proved the accident was not caused by a stuck throttle as
initially speculated.
</P>
<P>
There was no other immediate report on the cause of the
accident from Mercedes, the Penske team or CART.
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez was a regular in the European Formula 3000 series,
where he is second in the season points after finishing third last
year.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China's Electronic Exports Increase (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Despite hefty increases in
electronic exports, the sector is not doing as well as it should
be, today's China Daily "Business Weekly" reported.
</P>
<P>
A need for improved communications between electronics
manufacturers and trading houses has been cited.
</P>
<P>
Improved communications could help the industry become still
more competitive internationally.
</P>
<P>
According to an industry expert, exports of China's electronics
products during the first half of this year rose by 20.4 percent
from a year ago to 16.91 billion US dollars, accounting for 20.1
percent of exports during the same period.
</P>
<P>
Electronic exports are growing faster than any other export
item. Overall exports during the January-June period declined by 4.
6 percent to 83 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, electronic exports to Europe and the United States
are on the rise. More than 55 percent of the exports, worth 94.3
billion US dollars, were targeted at the EU and U.S. markets,
according to Chinese customs statistics.
</P>
<P>
The United States was the biggest target market with Chinese
electronic exports valued at 4.01 billion US dollars or 23.1
percent of Chinese electronic exports.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong and Japan ranked second and third after the U.S., and
the Japan-bound electronic exports during the period were 2.22
billion US dollars, making up 13.1 percent of electronic exports
during the January-June period.
</P>
<P>
The processing trade played a dominant role in the export of
electronic products.
</P>
<P>
Chinese customs statistics indicated that importing raw
materials for export-oriented processing and processing with
customers' materials, worth 15.24 billion US dollars, were factors
in 90.1 percent of the electronic exports during the first six
months of this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
Although processing trade contributes a lot to employment
opportunities and the foreign exchanges earnings of the country,
its shortcomings should not be ignored, the expert said.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the processing trade is easily affected
by fluctuations in exchanged rates on international financial
markets. It is a destabilizing factor in the pricing of electronic
exports and affects their competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
The processing trade is little concerned with China's
electronic industry and helps little in upgrading the industry and
optimizing its industrial structure.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the technological content of electronic exports
has increased only marginally during the past few years. As a
result most of the exports were of low-grade and possessed low
added value,newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Core technologies are controlled by foreign companies and there
are very few high-tech Chinese electronic firms of relatively-
large scale.
</P>
<P>
The prices of most electronic exports are low, which limits the
potential for expanding such exports because of thin profit margin.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a lack of common interests between Chinese
electronic manufacturers and trading houses undermines the
competitiveness of such exports.
</P>
<P>
Most of the manufacturers, which acquired foreign trading
rights over the past 10 years, are paying large "tuitions" to
learn to how to explore the world electronic markets.
</P>
<P>
Most of the trading houses, ignored by the manufacturers, are
pulling away from the electronic products exporting businesses and
taking decades of professional experience with them.
</P>
<P>
To eradicate snags cutting into the competitiveness of Chinese
electronic exports, the experts suggested the country should
commit itself to developing high-tech and high value-added
electronic products and encourage the co-operation between
industrial firms and trading houses.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, September 12 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region leads the nation in research on test tube cattle
breeding.
</P>
<P>
Three fourths of China's cattle produced in this way come from
the Institute for the Propagation of Animals, which is affiliated
with Guangxi University. Sources at the institute say that it has
produced 229 head of test tube cattle since September 1992, when
the country's first twin test tube calves were born.
</P>
<P>
Most of the cattle are produced for other provinces, autonomous
regions and municipalities. The survival rate is well over 80
percent. The institute has developed into China's biggest and most
advanced research center. The research is led by 36-year-old Shi
Deshun, the country's best-known animal breeder, who has a
doctorate from Dublin University in Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Shi says his institute can now mass producing cattle
embryos and has set up a high-tech business for this work.
Preparation is now underway for a center to produce cattle embryo
of fine breeds, which can provide cattle embryos and could produce
a big impact on the world's cattle-breeding business, he adds.

<HEADLINE> Tianjin Strives to Be Industrial Base in Northeast Asia (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Tianjin Municipality in north
China has been growing from a domestic industrial city into an
international industrial base, Mayor Li Shenglin said today when
discussing the city's prospects for the 21st Century.
</P>
<P>
Looking back at the great changes that have occurred in Tianjin
since the founding of new China in 1949, Li said the city's
industrial growth has gone through two stages: one in the 1960s,
when modern industry emerged; and the other after the
implementation of reform and opening-up policy two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
Eleven industrial areas were set up at the outskirts of the
city after 1949, and a compact industrial system was established
when a group of key factories, including the Dagang Oilfield Group
Limited Company, the Tianjin Oil Refinery, the Tianjin Automobile
Works, and the Tianjin Watch Factory were set up one after another.
</P>
<P>
The total industrial output value in 1978 reached 15.79 billion
yuan (about 189.5 million U.S. dollars), 24-fold more than in 1949.
</P>
<P>
Since 1978 the municipality has been turning into an
international port city, and also a production base in northeast
Asia. The total industrial output value last year was as much as
256.2 billion yuan, 13.6 times that of 1978.
</P>
<P>
Li added that in the past few years, Tianjin has benefited
enormously from the reform of its existing industries.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Tianjin Strives to Be Industrial Base in Northeast Asia (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
And as one of the first 14 coastal cities open to foreign
countries in 1984, it now has 12,593 foreign-funded firms, with
contractual funding of 24.16 billion U.S.dollars, and 1.13 billion
in actual capital investment.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the industrial output value of such firms,
as a whole, accounts for more than 40 percent of the city's total,
and export volume over 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
Oceanic petro-chemistry, electronics, automobiles and machinery,
and metallurgy, are currently the four pillar industries for the
city. And some multinationals, such as the Motorola, the Samsung,
the Toyota, and the Otis, have entered these sectors.
</P>
<P>
"The eastward movement of industry, and the rationalization of
the industrial structure is underway now," said Li.
</P>
<P>
The Tianjin Coastal Development Zone, the Tianjin Economic
Development Area, and a group of large chemical enterprises have
all been set up in accordance with the city's strategy to move
the industry boom eastward.
</P>
<P>
The domestic output value of the Tianjin Coastal Development
Zone last year was above 30 percent of the total, industrial
output over 34 percent, exports volume more than 49 percent, with
electronics, modern metallurgy, petro-chemistry, and oceanic
chemistry as the main components.
</P>
<P>
"Tianjin is now striving to become a bridge between the
domestic and international markets, an exit for the Chinese
enterprises to the world, and a channel for overseas companies
into China," said Li.
</P>
<P>
He added that they will work hard to improve operations in
fields of retail business, real estate, finance, information
exchange, and agriculture, according to the international
standards.

<HEADLINE> Investment in Tourism Soars in Costa Rica </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Investment in Costa Rica's
tourism industry grew 87.41 percent from January to June this year,
the Costa Rican Tourism Institute (ICT) said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
ICT Promotion Department data show that the biggest investment
increase in the sector occurred in lodging while growth was also
registered with new projects of accommodation and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
Investment for hotel-building went up from 247,000 U.S. dollars
in the first quarter of the year to more than 16 million dollars
in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica received 500,000 tourists during the first half of
1999, said Eduardo Leon Paez, ICT executive chairman. He added
that he expects "Tourist One Million" in Costa Rica between
November and December.
</P>
<P>
Tourism is the main hard-currency earner for Costa Rica. Last
year, the income from tourism amounted to 812 million dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Residents of Lhasa, the capital
of China's Tibet Autonomous Region, eat an average 10,000 kg of
fruit daily, statistics from the city's commerce department show.
</P>
<P>
A fruit wholesaler told Xinhua that more than 20 kinds of
fruits, including Lichi from Hainan Province and the Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region in south China, watermelon and grapes
from northwest China's Gansu Province and the Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region, and even fruit from the United States, Thailand
and Latin America, are sold in Lhasa.
</P>
<P>
A decade ago, fresh fruit was regarded as a luxury in Tibet.
Now fruit sales are brisk in Lhasa and the price is comparatively
low, the vendor said.
</P>
<P>
This year's sales volume of imported fruit to Lhasa is expected
to double over last year.

<P>
BRUSSELS, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Latvia's Romans Vainsteins
outsprinted Switzerland's Beat Zberg to take the 260-kilometer
Paris-Brussels cycling classic on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Zberg, who rode for Italy's Vini Caldirola team, became the
first Latvian winner of the race as he chalked up a winning time
of five hours and 59 minutes.
</P>
<P>
After both breaking away from the pack, Zberg launched the
decisive attack with about 18 kms left, but Vainsteins quickly
caught him and the two riders took turns at the front.
</P>
<P>
With about 200 meters left, Vainsteins seized his chance and
left Zberg in his wake to take the victory, adding to his
successes this year including winning a stage of the Giro d'Italia
in May.
</P>
<P>
Two of the race favorites, Belgium's Johan Museeuw and Italy's
Mirko Celestino, chose the famous Alsemberg hill, about 36 kms
from the finish, for a break. But their efforts turned out to be
a failure.

<HEADLINE> Pearce Breaks Leg </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 11 (Xinhua) -- England defender Stuart Pearce
broke his leg in a match on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The injury, which he sustained during West Ham United's 1-0 win
over Watford, would threaten the veteran left-back's revived
premier league career.
</P>
<P>
West Ham United manager Harry Redknapp said Pearce had cracked
a bone in his leg after he was involved in a heavy tackle. "He's
broken his leg. He was running for a tackle and I heard a crack
at the time," said Redknapp. "He was right in front of the dugout.
"
</P>
<P>
Redknapp said Pearce, signed on a free transfer after former
Newcastle United manager Ruud Gullit made clear to the player that
he thought his career was over, would be out for "quite a while".
</P>
<P>
"He's been in such fantastic form for us and he's been such a
terrific lad to have around the place. The fans have taken to him
immediately...he'll be badly missed," added Redknapp.
</P>
<P>
Pearce, who won his England recall and 78th international cap
this month after a two-year absence, was turned down by a handful
of clubs before West Ham took him to help them through a defensive
injury crisis.
</P>
<P>
The injury left West Ham with a renewed crisis at the back,
with Ian Pearce out with knee ligament damage after being injured
on the opening day of the season.
</P>
<P>
Rio Ferdinand, Neil Ruddock and Scott Minto are also injured.
</P>
<P>
"We really are desperately short," said Redknapp.

LONDON, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Defending champions Manchester
United jumped to a six-point lead after just seven matches in the
premier league season when they beat arch-rivals Liverpool 3-2 on

<P>
Meanwhile, Newcastle United, with ex-England and Barcelona
coach Bobby Robson in charge for the first game, lost to Chelsea 1-
0 for a controversial penalty in the 37th minute, and they remain

at Highbury. Nwankwo Kanu scored Arsenal's third.
</P>
<P>
United have 19 points followed by Arsenal, Chelsea, Aston Villa,
West Ham United and Leeds United on 13. Chelsea and West Ham have

WASHINGTON, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Serena Williams claimed
historic Grand Slam win as she outlasted Martina Hingis in two
sets to capture the title of the U.S. Open tennis championships in
New York on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Williams dominated most of the game for a 6-3, 7-6 (7-4)
victory, giving the 17-year-older a title in only her second year
as a pro and making herself the first black woman to win a Grand
Slam champion since fellow American Althea Gibson in 1958.
</P>
<P>
Williams controlled the rhythm until late in the second set
when top seeded Hingis , who has beat twice Serena's older sister
Venus Williams in the U.S. Open, managed to keep herself in the
game and pressured Williams liable to mistakes.
</P>
<P>
But Serena clawed back into the game and sent the thriller to a
tiebreak before she claimed the victory on her third match point
of the day as Hingis was long with a backhand lob.
</P>
<P>
The victory means the Americans will capture both singles
titles. Earlier Saturday, Todd Martin routed Frenchman Cedric
Pioline 6-4, 6-1, 6-2 to set up an all U.S. final, against fellow
American Andre Agassi.
</P>
<P>
Agassi did his part by rallying from a first-set debacle to
beat Yevgeny Kafelnikov 1-6, 6-3, 6-3, 6-3.

<HEADLINE> China Urges Halt to Violence in East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 11 (Xinhua) -- China demanded
Saturday that all forms of violence in East Timor be stopped
immediately and the security of U.N. personnel there be protected.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Permanent Representative to the U.N. Qin Huasun made
the statement at a Security Council debate on East Timor following
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's appeal to Indonesia for
accepting a multi-national peace-keeping force for East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Appreciating U.N.'s efforts for the smooth conducting of the
ballot on East Timor's future, which turned to be in favor of
independence, the envoy said China hopes that the ballot outcome
will be fully implemented in a peaceful and orderly environment.
</P>
<P>
China is gravely concerned over the continuing violence and
resulting humanitarian crisis in East Timor, hoping that the
measures taken by the Indonesian Government will achieve desirable
results as soon as possible, Qin said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the issue of East Timor must be solved through
the United Nations and the deployment of any peace-keeping force
should be at the request of the Indonesian Government and endorsed
by the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
"China is willing to be actively involved in efforts by the
U.N. in this connection," he said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Rejects Outside Military Action in E. Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia on Saturday
reiterated its position of rejecting an international military
force for East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian Ambassador to the U.N. Makarim Wibisono told the
Security Council that Indonesia does not see the need of such a
force at the moment.
</P>
<P>
"My government, while fully understanding the willingness of a
number of countries to provide security assistance to Indonesia,
does not foresee the need for the introduction of a
multi-national, or a peace-keeping force at this stage," he said.
</P>
<P>
The envoy said for now indonesia's imposition of martial law on
September 7 was already helping improve the security situation in
the territory, the former Portuguese colony annexed by Indonesia
in 1976 after Portugals' withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
"Such an operation may well exacerbate the situation and be
counter-productive, however well-intentioned it may be," he said.
</P>
<P>
The idea of sending a multi-national force to East Timor was
raised by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan Friday as he saw the
security situation there deteriorating.
</P>
<P>
Many countries expressed their support to the idea at the
council's debate and the discussions would be resumed as soon as
the council's mission to Jakarta returns next week.
